and i did it in that voice			0
and i have never done that voice before in my life			0
i do n't know where that voice came from			2
but i heard myself use that voice			0
and in my mind , i went , oh ( @entity2 )			0
i just gave myself @entity12			1
" -- @entity13 , @entity14 , 5/4/2014 it 's hard to build a more inclusive society when people keep making fun of you			1
even as people with disabilities and their allies make progress in so many ways , disability remains a target for mockery			2
over the last few days , a baby boy with @entity12 named @entity29 has been all over the news			1
he and his twin sister were born to a surrogate mother in @entity33 , but allegedly when their @entity36 parents discovered the boy 's genetic condition , they left him behind			2
to the biological parents , it seems , the words " @entity12 " meant that he was not worth being their son			1
these are the stakes involved in how we talk and think about disability , how we portray disability in the media , not to mention in our schools and homes			0
i 'm the father of a boy with @entity12			1
i remember weeping when i heard the diagnosis			0
my mother said she could n't stop thinking about how he 'd be taunted and bullied as he got older			2
her experience of people with intellectual disabilities was that they were targets for cruel humor			2
the good news is that in recent years , sustained awareness campaigns against dehumanizing speech , coupled with some 20 years of inclusive education since the passage of the @entity67 in 1990 , have made things a lot better in @entity70			1
no one is likely to call my son the r - word to his face			2
the bad news is that perhaps we have focused too much on explicit language without addressing the deeper questions of portrayal and representation			0
too often , people with disabilities are marginalized and excluded			2
instead of focusing on a single word , we 've got to work to unravel the prejudices beneath the surface			0
last may , @entity13 , former " @entity87 " correspondent and comedian , appeared on " @entity14 , " a popular show on @entity89			1
he told a story about a bad experience eating a pot brownie			0
the joke was that it made him talk , uncontrollably , in a funny voice , as if he had down syndrome			1
@entity96 , @entity97 , broke the flow of the piece in order to issue a kind of disclaimer			1
he said : " now let me just say , i know what down syndrome is			2
i know that @entity12 is something that you 're born with when you are born with an extra chromosome			1
i know all that information			0
i knew that information then			0
but something about eating this brownie made me think that somehow i had grown an extra chromosome and i now had adult - onset down syndrome			1
and for people who have down syndrome , it 's something they grow up with			1
and they grow up and they have healthy and happy lives			0
" then he went right back to his fake voice , slurring words , and sounding confused			0
@entity13 did not respond to emails asking for a comment			1
[ he has since commented on the piece here			0
] and the host of the show , @entity127 , declined to comment for this piece			1
@entity127 did write , however , to @entity129 , the mother of a child with @entity12			1
she shared that e-mail with me			0
@entity127 wrote : " i agree with you completely that nobody should have to listen to stories that mock and denigrate ( people with @entity12 ) this was a concern for me and my producers when we were working with @entity13			1
we talked about it as we shaped the story			0
" he then notes that @entity13 went out of his way to make the disclaimer , claims that @entity13 is making himself the butt of the joke , and that , " the only thing that possibly could be offensive is his imitation of what a person with @entity12 sounds like , and again -- we may disagree about that -- i think that 's fair game for a comedian			1
" @entity127 and @entity13 used the disclaimer , used the statement that they know what down syndrome is , medically , as a way to protect themselves from criticism			1
however , as @entity127 admits , the humor of this piece depends on making fun of the way that some people with @entity12 speak			1
since my son was very young , we 've worked for so many hours on his speech			2
together , we 've worked with many therapists to carve out individual phonemes , tones , sounds and finally words			0
each tiny advance takes months			0
i wept when i heard him say , " i love you " for the first time , even though it was in a slurred , indistinct voice of the exact type that @entity13 was mocking			1
moreover , speech is so fraught , because intelligibility -- how clearly my son can communicate with strangers -- determines what kind of independence will be possible for him as an adult			2
there is no disclaimer that can take the sting out of @entity13 's joke			1
he and @entity127 can decide that the humor of the piece is worth being offensive , but they do n't get to determine whether the hurt is real or just			1
neither do the many comics that rely on punching down , using mockery of people marginalized by ability , race , religion , gender or sexuality to get a laugh			2
@entity208 , in the @entity207 tv show " @entity210 , " plays a man who appears to be disabled			2
@entity210 is supposed to be a positive example , but much of the comedy extends from his disabled physicality -- a hunched back , a slacked toothsome mouth , and a shuffling walk			0
other laughs come from his cluelessness as he cheerily staggers through uncomfortable scenes			0
@entity208 has said he does n't mean to make fun of people with intellectual disabilities , saying in an interview , " i 've never considered him disabled ; he is a ' out of the mouth of babies ' innocent person who always says the right thing that you did n't see coming			1
and if i say he 's not disabled , that 's the end of it			0
" that 's not the end of it			0
in the end , it does n't matter whether a comedian uses a diagnostic term , issues a disclaimer , or claims to be the butt of the joke			1
humor can reinforce stereotypes or destroy them			0
when you make fun of attributes associated with disability , you might as well just be standing on stage , shouting the r - word .			0

@entity250 : it 's hard to build inclusive world when people mock down syndrome
on @entity127 show , comedian @entity13 made derisive reference to @entity12
he says @entity127 said it 's fair game for comedy . @entity250 , who has @entity12 son , disagrees
@entity250 : @entity97 , @entity127 can defend comedy , but do n't get to say whether hurt it causes is real
