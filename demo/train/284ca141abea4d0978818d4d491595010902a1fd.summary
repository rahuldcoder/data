@entity0 -- what will the @entity2 get the royal wee one ? sources tell @entity1 they 're planning a special gift but just what that will be is a topic of animated debate inside the @entity11 and the @entity12			1
judging by the secrecy around the process , you 'd think they were guarding state secrets			0
no baby buggy will do			0
the president and first lady must find a special gift to honor the special relationship between the @entity22 and the @entity23			1
@entity24 and @entity25 bring home royal baby boy presidents have a spotty history when it comes to giving gifts for the births of @entity23 royals			1
when prince @entity25 was born in 1982 , the @entity33 gave him a child - size @entity35 - style corner chair with a needlepoint seat			1
but when his younger brother , @entity38 , was born two years later , they gave nothing			2
according to the @entity41 , there was some criticism over the cost of @entity25 's chair , though it was less than $ 1,000 , according to reports			2
@entity47 was president when prince @entity48 was born in 1948			1
the @entity22 had recently fought @entity49 by @entity23 's side , but still all @entity38 and @entity51 sent to mark the occasion was a telegram			1
they received a polite reply in return			0
photos : first look at royal baby @entity60 did even less for the birth of the current queen in 1926 : he sent nothing			1
so the pressure is on the @entity2 to improve the record			0
@entity66 of the @entity67 says a gift is meant to help in " building or cementing relationships , " and she believes the @entity2 should send two : an official one from the @entity22 people and a personal one from them as a couple			2
@entity24 follows in @entity74 's footsteps for the official gift she suggests a piece of moon rock because the new prince was born under the full moon ; an @entity22 - made teddy bear , as the toy 's namesake is @entity83 ; or a sapling from a great @entity22 tree to plant on palace property			1
says @entity87 , " would n't it be lovely when the prince is 80 years old and @entity90 of the @entity23 , and he looks out the window and says , ' this tree and i are the same age			0
this tree was presented by the @entity22 the day i was born			2
' " for a more personal gift from the @entity2 , @entity87 would endorse @entity22 crafts such as a rocking chair or a quilt made of 50 squares , one for every state in the union			1
prince @entity100 ? another option on her list : a hobby horse , though she emphasizes it must be made of @entity22 wood , from a tree " that fell by natural causes			2
we do n't want to be accused of chopping down a tree to make a gift for the prince			0
" she also suggests original art from the book " @entity115 , " because both the president and first lady have said it 's one of their favorite books , and @entity121 , the main character , is crowned king in his fantasy			0
just as important as what to give is what not to give			0
in this category : no political gifts , obviously , especially no " silver spoons " -- too many opportunities for puns			1
and @entity87 suggests no gender - specific gifts because the royals just went through the process of changing the rules of succession to allow for a female heir , so this would n't be the right time to highlight the fact that the heir is a boy rather than a girl			0
finally , @entity87 says , " i pray that the @entity2 do n't pop down to the gift shop of the @entity11 ... i noticed there is a bib , a blanket , a onesie with the @entity11 seal on it			0

gifts for @entity25 and @entity152 's baby must honor special @entity22 - @entity23 relationship
@entity25 got a gift from @entity33 when he was born ; brother @entity38 got nothing
@entity47 sent telegram for @entity48 ' birth ; @entity60 did even less for queen 's birth
*protocol* *expert* suggests @entity22 - made crafts -- but no silver spoons
