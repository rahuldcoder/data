@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's small , affluent , tech - savvy and it has a very obvious pollution problem -- @entity0 is arguably an ideal destination for electric cars			1
@entity8 , the electric vehicle developed in @entity0 , would be perfect for the city , but faces big obstacles			1
and despite the absence of a car - making industry , the city can now boast a home - made electric car all of its own			2
@entity8 , a two - seater micro car , will roll of the production line for the very first time in october and will be available for purchase			1
but you wo n't find it on sale in @entity0			1
@entity0 still has n't got its act together when it comes to electric vehicles ( @entity27 ) , according to the chief executive of @entity8 's manufacturer , @entity30 , @entity31			1
she says the city lacks the necessary framework and policies that would make it viable for her company to sell @entity8 here			1
so they are heading to @entity41 instead			1
" in @entity45 they have government incentives to get people to switch from gasoline to electric vehicles , " explains @entity31 , citing the waiver of the congestion charge and free parking for @entity27 in @entity45 as an example			1
" but that has to be driven by the government			2
in @entity0 they are still debating whether to use diesel or whatever			1
" @entity0 is not without @entity27 though			1
private organizations like local utility @entity57 has its own small fleet of them			0
but according to @entity31 , the restrictions they have to operate under mean introducing them now into the mass market is n't practical			1
" [ @entity57 ] only use them inside their private site and they have to get a very special licence and they ca n't drive outside their site and they are restricted to certain uses , " she says			2
" we do n't want those kinds of restrictions			2
" make it hip , make it affordable @entity41 to date has taken the lead when it comes to encouraging motorists to drive cleaner cars			1
most notably , @entity45 has cracked down on car - related pollution with the introduction of a congestion charge and , more recently , with additional fees for heavier polluting cars to pay on top			0
under the rules of the @entity90 , for example , fees as high as $ 400 can be imposed on trucks and vans trying to enter @entity45 that are more than six years old			0
" there should be very high incentives for people [ to drive @entity27 ] , " says chairman of local pollution lobby group , @entity98 , @entity99			0
but @entity99 says the political will is still not there to promote @entity27 in the city			0
he believes it is down to the market to stir up interest			1
" this will only happen with market pressure - it is hard to see it otherwise , " says @entity99			2
" if the @entity27 became hip , then it would have an effect			0
" but in order for this kind of customer pressure to happen , customers need to want the cars in the first place			0
that 's about education , says professor @entity120 , director of the @entity121 at the @entity122 , whose team was involved in the @entity8 project			1
and education needs to come from the government , he says			2
" the government is not helping the car user , " says @entity120			2
" it has n't put any special mechanism in place , any special law or regulation for motorists to drive @entity27			0
i do n't think the government has done anything to persuade motorists to use @entity27			1
" @entity136 are not familiar with @entity27 he says , and are concerned about the technology so they need to be shown that @entity27 are just as good as petrol cars			0
one obvious way to demonstrate that would be to change the public transportation system from diesel - fueled to electric - powered , he says			1
" @entity147 , minibuses , buses can be forced to go electric but the government is n't doing anything , " says @entity120			1
the government has in the past offered one - off grants to minibus drivers ranging from $ 7,000 to $ 10,000 to encourage them to convert from diesel to either @entity154 or electric			1
however @entity120 says stronger measures are needed			0
" voluntary schemes do not work			0
the government needs to put a mandatory scheme [ in place ] , to start off with public transport so people can get used to it and see that it is good			1
" and then there is the question of money			0
@entity120 says the amount of money his department received to design @entity8 was nowhere near enough and to him , it told him how important the government view @entity27			1
" the money involved was very small			0
it was about $ 130,000 for mycar			0
you need tens of millions of dollars			0
how can we build a new generation of @entity27 for @entity0 ? we need to train the new engineers , the graduates , technicians , " he says			2
" car - makers want subsidies from the government , as the initial costs are very high			0
the government needs to give them financial support and i am not talking about one or two million @entity0 dollars			1
we also need more investment in @entity190			0
" in the meantime @entity31 is making plans to sell mycar in @entity45 , her first stop the @entity195 in july to stir up some more interest			0
one day she hopes to come back to @entity0			2
she says @entity30 is ready now			0
the market is n't though			2
and that , she says , is something that is in the government 's hands			0
" we want to come here -- as long as the policy is there to make it happen , " says @entity31			0
" it would be sad and kind of ironic if we can sell them all over the world and not in our own home town			0
" we have the customer , the market demand , and the product - we just need the government to support it			2

new electric vehicle , @entity8 , developed in @entity0 , but wo n't be sold there
lack of government and market interest means @entity8 will be sold in @entity41
large *capacity* for electric power , especially in public transport
