-- with fans still reeling from last sunday 's @entity3 episode , " @entity4 , " the third season of " @entity6 " comes to a close this weekend , and no one is waiting with more bated breath for that than @entity11 , who plays @entity12 , the @entity13 on the @entity15 program			1
" even though i 've read all the scripts , i was n't around when they shot all of it , " he reminded @entity0			0
" so one of the things that 's great about this show is that i can actually watch it and enjoy it , despite knowing what 's going to happen			1
" @entity11 , who recently appeared in the @entity27 film " @entity28 " and is shooting " @entity29 , " a romantic comedy with @entity31 and @entity32 , finds the most interesting aspect of watching " @entity6 " is being able to reassess the constantly shifting scales of morality in a world where no one character is completely a hero or a villain ( save for perhaps @entity41 ? )			1
@entity43 , for instance , might be the @entity43 and liberating slaves , " but she 's burning down cities ! she 's killing all these other people ! " he laughed			1
" i 'm sure a lot of those guards are just guys with families			0
" the @entity53 and their men , he pointed out , committed their own share of atrocities , even if they were portrayed as a more honorable family than the @entity59			0
" one of my favorite scenes with @entity62 ( played by @entity63 ) was last season , when we come across three girls hanging , " @entity11 recalled			1
" @entity62 kills the @entity68 guards , because they had just raped these women for no reason , because they thought it was within their rights			0
" if @entity68 's beheading in season one and the @entity3 in season three taught us anything , @entity11 said , it should be to look at the chain of consequences of each character 's actions			1
for instance , @entity81 did n't fully investigate a claim of attempted murder and arrested the wrong man , starting a war			0
and @entity87 broke a treaty of arranged marriage that was meant to broker an ally			0
" in our world , for our morals , he did the right thing -- he married for love , " @entity11 said			1
" but it was a selfish thing to do , because when he did that , they lost the support of part of the army and prolonged the war and thousands more were killed			0
" the @entity3 , as brutal as it was to see certain characters get slaughtered , had an unseen consequence : " it stopped the war			0
a lot more people were saved			0
" of course , a @entity12 would be in support of the @entity3 -- the @entity59 had a little something to do with it , hence @entity113 's statement before killing someone , " the @entity59 send their regards			2
" still , @entity11 finds it interesting to gauge fan response and see which actions on the show provoke the more extreme reactions			1
he was surprised to see more people were disgusted in season one that @entity12 " was having sex with his own sister than that he pushed a kid out a window			0
" " i thought , ' well , he 's in love with her , and i would n't want that in my own life , but they 're two consenting adults , ' " he said			2
" i would think you 'd be more upset about him trying to kill a kid			0
" in a subsequent episode , fans were in an uproar about @entity68 killing a direwolf ( @entity141 's @entity140 was punished in place of @entity144 's @entity143 , since she had been forced to run off after attacking @entity41 )			1
" in the scene right before that , you saw ( @entity41 's guard ) the hound riding in with the butcher 's boy ( @entity149 ) on his horse			2
he had just killed this little innocent kid , and no one was upset at that , " @entity11 said			1
" but then this mystical creature was killed , and that was crossing a line			0
that was shocking for people : ' how could they kill an innocent animal ? ' " ( were fans more upset that @entity87 's @entity162 was killed in his kennel than his men at their table ? ) at this point in the show , the perception of @entity11 's own character -- formerly considered a villain -- is shifting to the point where fans are rooting for him			1
since losing his hand , @entity12 has also become more sympathetic , " because it 's such an obstacle and forces such a change in him			2
" his speech to @entity62 , about how he killed the @entity178 to save the city , also changes the meaning of his moniker , the @entity13 , which had been used as a pejorative			1
" i think he sees that as his finest moment , " @entity11 said			1
" he did break his vow to protect the king , but there was no way he could not break it			0
and he 's had to live with that choice ever since			2
" as @entity62 and @entity12 make their way to @entity191 in the finale , the @entity59 are in a state of flux			2
does @entity12 even still love @entity194 , who he dedicated his life to , now that he 's developed a new relationship based on mutual respect ? " his relationship with @entity194 is not a very healthy relationship , because it 's all on her terms , " @entity11 noted			1
" and for the first time in his life , he 's been together with another adult who is so unlike the world of @entity191 , who says what she means , who does what she says , who walks the walk			2
he sees something in @entity62 that he might have feared or lost in himself			0
" a sense of honor , perhaps			0
" losing his hand , he 's been forced to reconsider everything			2
" but do n't expect that relationship to be resolved in the final hour of this season , because as any good season finale will do , @entity11 said , " it will provide closure , and it will set up next year			1
but it will make for a tricky homecoming , that 's for sure ! "			0

after last week 's shocking episode of " @entity6 , " stakes are high for sunday finale
the @entity13 , played by @entity11 , says there are no clear - cut heroes or villains
the finale will provide closure , as well as raise new questions .
