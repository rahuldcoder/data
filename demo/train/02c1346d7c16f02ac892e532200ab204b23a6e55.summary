" be kind , please rewind , " the signs used to say in video stores , urging customers to return their rented @entity4 tapes spooled back to the beginning			2
if only @entity6 could rewind back to the 1990s			1
that was the time when the video chain was the colossus of the movie - rental business , with stores in seemingly every city shopping district and suburban strip mall in @entity14			1
visiting the store was a weekly rite for many people , who would show up on friday evenings to check out the latest releases , navigating a crush of couples and families who had exactly the same idea -- only to find out that the last copy of " @entity24 " or " @entity25 " had already been snagged			1
that custom is now as gone as a world with three television networks , a @entity31 station 's late show and a @entity32			0
on wednesday , @entity33 , which purchased @entity6 in 2011 , announced it was closing the chain 's 300 remaining @entity14 - based retail stores , as well as its distribution centers			1
" consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment , " said @entity33 president and ceo @entity37 in the press release about the closures			0
his statement echoes many from recent years about the migration of entertainment from physical objects -- cds , dvds , books , games -- to bits , bytes and pixels available on various screens and portable devices			2
@entity6 will continue its @entity6 @ home brand to @entity33 customers , as well as its @entity61 streaming service			1
and an additional 50 @entity6 stores not owned by @entity33 will remain open for the time being			1
reaction : jokes and shrugs the action was long expected			0
@entity6 had been closing stores for years , as is obvious from the yawning vacancies still present in many of those very same strip malls			1
the chain was done in by @entity73 , streaming video and a world of internet options			1
reaction from that @entity78 was , of course , swift and pithy			0
several posts on @entity80 made fun of the store 's late fees -- the bane of people who could n't get their rental back in the standard 48 hours -- and the @entity4 tapes that made @entity6 's name			1
" i knew this day would come			0
i 'm mere months away from owning a @entity4 copy of @entity92 without paying my late fees to @entity6 , " wrote @entity90			1
" yes ! all the @entity94 are closing ! that means they 'll never get back that @entity4 tape of @entity98			0
i won ! " added actor and comedian @entity100			0
many said they did n't even realize @entity6 had any stores left			1
in a headline , the @entity104 put it best : " internet kills the @entity108			2
" but @entity109 , author of the forthcoming book " @entity111 " and a film professor at the @entity113 , wants to praise @entity6 , not bury it			1
the stores were clean and family - friendly , with wider aisles and a bigger emphasis on movie selection than the mom - and - pops that dotted the landscape in the 1980s , he said			1
" they really standardized video rental in general , " @entity109 said			2
as with many franchises , at its height @entity6 often came in for criticism			1
the chain put many mom - and - pop stores out of business			1
befitting its name , it generally catered to a blockbuster mentality : hit releases filled shelves by the dozens , but independent and foreign - language films could be hard to come by			0
the stores would n't carry @entity137 - 17 films at all			2
and then there was the @entity6 clerk , easily recognized in a blue knit shirt , who was often depicted as either clueless or snotty , depending on how frustrated you were on those crowded friday nights			1
but @entity109 , a former video clerk himself -- though not at @entity6 -- points out that @entity6 was successful for a reason			2
it had more variety than many video stores : blockbuster stores were required to have a minimum of 7,000 movies and averaged 10,000 , more than many of its competitors , he said			0
by doing so , it opened up more of @entity14 to more movies ( and , later , tv show collections )			2
even though @entity6 itself primarily stuck to cities and suburbs , it became a model for other chains that opened stores in small towns			1
playing catch - up if people compared @entity6 to @entity163 's , that was n't necessarily a knock , said @entity109			1
" they self - consciously modeled themselves on @entity167 , and at various points hired members of @entity167 's upper management , " he said			0
but over the last decade , business took one hit after another			0
in a september article , the @entity175 's @entity174 described how independent video stores were put out of business			2
the same trends affected @entity6			2
first there were dvds , which were relatively inexpensive and intended for purchase , especially compared to the @entity4 titles that cost stores up to $ 100 a pop. with the advent of broadband , people started downloading movies and shows -- not always legally			2
@entity73 and @entity191 used the slim size of @entity193 to their advantage			0
and finally , " @entity195 was launched , and your average @entity198 and @entity199 were introduced to @entity200 , " @entity174 said			0
even @entity6 's late fees came back to bite the chain in an unlikely way			1
in 1997 , a man named @entity205 returned a late copy of " @entity207 " to his local @entity6			2
he was assessed a $ 40 fee			0
two years later , he founded @entity73			0
@entity6 was caught flat - footed by many of these changes			1
it could have purchased @entity73 for $ 50 million in 2000 , but passed			0
as @entity73 rose , @entity6 's attempts to compete on @entity73 's terms -- especially through the mail -- foundered			2
it also tried to compete with @entity191 using standalone kiosks			0
that did n't work , either			0
by the time @entity6 was sold to @entity33 in 2011 , it was down to 1,700 stores , more than 7,000 fewer than its peak just seven years earlier			1
people had long since started devoting their friday nights to streaming and downloading at home -- and if they were heading out , it was n't to a @entity6			1
the @entity225 , of course , nailed it			0
in a 2008 video headlined " @entity230 were rented in the past , " the satiric site showcased a @entity228 venue that " aims to transport visitors to a time before the @entity78			0
" like a version of @entity233 , it had actors playing clerks and customers who described how the rental process worked			0
onlookers watched the performance , stunned			0
" it 's really amazing that people had to go through so much just to get a movie , " says a visitor in the skit .			0

@entity6 *climbed* high in the 1990s on the videotape - rental business
the company announced wednesday it would close its remaining @entity14 stores
once - *dominant* chain was done in by dvds , streaming , internet
but when @entity6 was at peak , friday - night visits were an @entity14 rite
