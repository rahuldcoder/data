-- here 's what i want for @entity3 : i want my children to develop a passion for science			2
i 've decided to grease the wheels			2
i 've called the best for advice			2
his name is @entity12 , professor of physics and mathematics at @entity15			1
he 's getting kids engaged at his @entity17			2
he has even written a children 's book based on relativity , " @entity20			1
" @entity21 was the boy in the ancient @entity23 myth whose father crafted him wings of wax			2
the father warned @entity21 not to fly too close to the sun. @entity21 ignored him			2
his wax wings melted , and he died			2
@entity12 's reincarnation of @entity21 was born on a space ship -- part of a community of explorers on a 25 - trillion mile search for life on another planet			1
he is 14 , which gets my attention , because it 's about the same age as my oldest daughter			2
the length of the spaceship 's journey means @entity21 must live his whole life within the confines of that ship			0
" but , " writes @entity12 , the boy " had a palpable yearning for something beyond the life he 'd been handed			1
" one day the ship 's captain , @entity21 ' father , announces : " we are making an emergency course diversion to avoid an uncharted black hole			0
" @entity21 has built his own small spacecraft			0
he has done the calculations			0
he ignores his father 's warning			0
he sets out to approach the black hole , to get within " a hairsbreadth above the point of no return			0
" he miscalculates ever so slightly and is thrust 10,000 years into the future			0
he is found by a new generation and is briefed on the long history he just missed , including the fact that the universe was now , as a result of the mission his father commanded , in an era of interstellar cooperation and lasting peace			0
when @entity12 's wife read the story to their young son , the boy cried at the thought of the permanent separation			1
my own son , after he heard the story , wanted @entity12 to write a sequel that could bring @entity21 back in time to be reunited with his dad			1
i do not want my children to follow @entity21 ' perilous and lonely path			0
or do i ? the young explorer @entity12 says he wrote the book in part because he felt the @entity23 myth sent the wrong message : " that if you 're a courageous young spirit , you pay for it with your life , " @entity12 tells me			1
" my experience as a scientist is that , in order to push the boundaries of knowledge , you need to go where people tell you not to go			0
" it 's an approach to life that psychologist @entity109 has found to be critical in a child 's development			1
@entity109 is a professor of psychology at @entity113			1
and in some ways @entity21 is her kind of kid			0
not that @entity109 would ever encourage a child to fly near a black hole			1
but she 's impressed that @entity12 's @entity21 took a calculated risk -- not a reckless one			1
and his goal was worthy			0
" it sounds as though @entity21 weighed the pros and cons and made an informed decision			0
he was in search of knowledge and satisfying a real intellectual curiosity			0
" mindset in 40 years of studying children , @entity109 has identified a key factor that makes some children more resilient than others -- a characteristic that enables them " to be able to withstand turbulence , to bounce back when they 're knocked down			1
" @entity109 calls it mindset -- the growth mindset			1
with a growth mindset , says @entity109 , " people believe their basic abilities can be enhanced , developed through hard work , appropriate risk taking , experimentation , good instruction			1
" with a fixed mindset , " a child tends to view intelligence as a trait you either have or do n't			1
you are either smart or dumb			0
" kids who have this fixed mindset , says @entity109 , see it as " a huge risk to try something hard because then they may stumble and prove themselves not smart			1
" so they play it safe			0
they do n't challenge themselves			0
when @entity109 works with children , she teaches them " how their brains grow new connections every time they move out of their comfort zones -- every time they try hard things			1
" so , @entity109 asks , " how do we create conditions for children to try hard things -- to be appropriately risk taking and resilient ? " her answer : " they are the same conditions that create a growth mindset			1
" the dinner table @entity109 suggests we find ways to communicate to our children that " we value doing hard things , persisting , focusing -- without preaching , of course			1
... even sitting around the dinner table and asking , ' who had a great struggle today ? what are you going to struggle with tomorrow ? ' " the more you listen to @entity109 's insights about the growth mindset -- the more you realize how much it has in common with the spirit of science			1
it 's about taking the risk to explore			0
to get back up when you 're knocked down and explore some more			0
@entity21 revisited " @entity20 " was performed last month by " @entity198 " actor @entity197 and an 80 - piece orchestra in a 3,000 - seat theater in @entity201 packed with teachers , parents and students			2
a girl in the audience , @entity206 , later asked : " @entity21 be ok ? " that 's what we parents want to know			2
will our children be ok when we 're not there to protect them ? @entity12 's @entity21 took a risk			2
and he has a growth mindset			1
he is curious and resilient			0
i have to imagine , icarus will be ok			0
do you think encouraging risk - taking in children is a good idea ? share your opinion in the comments section below .			0

@entity223 asked some experts how he could interest his kids in science
physics professor @entity12 wrote " @entity20 " to *inspire* kids to take risks
psychologist @entity109 says kids can have a " growth mindset " or a " fixed mindset "
those with a growth mindset learn to take on hard challenges , @entity109 says
