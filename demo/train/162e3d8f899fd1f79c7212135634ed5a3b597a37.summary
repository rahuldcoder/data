-- the @entity1 announced thursday it is conducting a safety review of the asthma drug xolair after data from an ongoing study suggested an increased number of heart attacks and strokes among patients who use it			1
the drug , made by @entity12 and co-marketed by @entity13 , was approved in 2003			0
the study , which started in 2004 and is slated to end in 2012 , was mandated by the agency as part of its post-approval process			0
the data " suggest a disproportionate increase in ischemic heart disease , arrhythmias ... cardiac failure " and other conditions " in patients treated with @entity25 compared to the control group of patients not given the drug , " the agency said			1
@entity25 is approved for use by adults and adolescents ( 12 and older ) with moderate to severe persistent asthma who react to a perennial airborne allergen and whose symptoms are not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids			1
the study that raised the questions is called " evaluating the @entity39 and @entity40 in patients with @entity42 to @entity43 " -- @entity44 for short			2
it counted outcomes among some 5,000 @entity25 - treated patients and compared them with a control group of about 2,500 patients who were not taking @entity25			2
the @entity1 did not recommend changes to the prescribing information and is not advising patients to stop taking @entity25			1
the agency said it is working with @entity12 to get more information			0
it noted that the observational study is not a randomized trial , the kind that researchers consider to be the gold standard in determining cause and effect			1
in an observational trial , there can be differences in underlying risk factors for heart attack and stroke between the two study groups			1
the agency underscored the uncertainty it faces in deciding how to act : " posting this information does not mean that @entity1 has concluded there is a causal relationship between the drug products and the emerging safety issue , " it said			2
" nor does it mean that @entity1 is advising health care professionals to discontinue prescribing these products			2
@entity1 is considering , but has not reached a conclusion about , whether this information warrants any regulatory action			2
" in an e-mail , @entity13 noted that the study was being " conducted in a real - world setting " so the two groups " differed in their baseline characteristics			0
" the patients being treated with @entity25 , it said , " had more severe asthma " and related conditions			1
that , along with the focus of the study 's data collection , made it hard to determine whether the relationship to strokes and heart attacks was causal , it said			1
but patients and their doctors must cope with even more uncertainty than the @entity1 has faced , given that neither the drug company nor the agency is making public the data that sparked the alert			1
" we 're not getting into numbers at this point because we 're still in that evaluation stage , " said @entity12 spokeswoman @entity108			0
" it 's premature to really get into the details at this point			0
" the drug is used by 30,000 to 35,000 patients , representing less than one half of 1 percent of the eligible patient population , @entity116 said			1
it is administered by injection every other week in a doctor 's office			0
the estimated annual cost of the drug to the doctor -- before it gets marked up for the patient -- is about $ 19,000 , @entity116 said			0
dr. @entity128 , the executive vice president of the @entity129 , said he will recommend that his patients who are on the drug remain on it			0
" these are the patients that are more likely to have ( emergency room ) visits , hospitalizations and more problems with their asthma , " he said			0
still , he said , he would like to see the data that the @entity1 regulators have seen .			0

study suggests increased number of heart attacks , strokes among @entity25 users
@entity1 says results are from observational study , not a randomized trial
@entity1 is not advising asthma patients who use @entity25 to stop
