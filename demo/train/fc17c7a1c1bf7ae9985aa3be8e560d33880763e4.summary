@entity0 -- analysts and sources say a combination of experience working with the @entity6 in the field and political considerations are behind president @entity10 's expected nomination of gen. @entity11 to be the next director of the @entity6			1
@entity11 , the 58 - year - old four - star general who commands the @entity14 - led international military force in @entity15 , represents a new breed of military leader well - versed in counter-insurgency strategies that depend on coordination and cooperation with the @entity6 , analysts say			1
his experience and strong contacts in the major foreign - policy hot spots for the @entity10 administration -- @entity25 , @entity15 and @entity26 -- provide strategic value for the leader of @entity6 operations on the ground in those countries , according to security experts			1
@entity10 reorganizes national security team " he has a unique understanding of the important role of the @entity6 -- what they do , how they do it , " said @entity34 , @entity1 's security analyst who was a homeland security adviser to president @entity35			2
" i think he 's got a both a good understanding of how they work and their value to the military mission			0
" @entity44 , a former @entity6 officer now at the @entity46 's @entity45 , called the expected nomination of @entity11 a good move for the administration and the @entity6			1
" he has a great deal of experience in dealing with the most difficult problems confronting the @entity14 intelligence community today , " @entity50 told @entity1			0
" he also brings the perspective of a battlefield commander to the intelligence community			0
" at the same time , @entity11 also was considered a credible candidate to succeed adm. @entity59 as chairman of the @entity61 when @entity59 's term expires this year			1
as the architect and leader of the surge in @entity25 and now head of the @entity15 mission , @entity11 is considered the nation 's most well - known and popular military leader since @entity70			2
sources told @entity1 that @entity11 , whose current tour in @entity15 is winding up with the expected start of a troop drawdown later this year , never really wanted to be @entity61 chairman			1
instead , @entity11 wanted to be in a " command " rather than the joint chief chairman 's advisory role to the president , the sources said			1
for the @entity81 , the sources noted , the @entity6 role for @entity11 gives him an important command position that tends to stay out of the public spotlight , which could be important given @entity11 ' strong personality and the pending challenges of the @entity15 mission as the presidential campaign gets going			1
some conservatives complained that moving @entity11 to the @entity6 would deny the nation his leadership in a key role as the nation 's top military officer			1
" it seems clear that the administration 's number one desire was to deny one of the greatest generals of the last century the chairmanship of the @entity61 , " said @entity93 , vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the @entity94			2
" it is an incredible misuse of a great military leader , and the notion that someone of his caliber should go from turning around two wars to being number two in the @entity14 intelligence community seems almost comical , " she added , referring to director of national intelligence @entity102 as being the head of @entity14 intelligence			2
@entity116 called a move to the @entity6 for @entity11 " surprising , " given his military command experience			1
" is it the obvious next step in his illustrious career ? no , " @entity116 said , adding : " but he 'll do very well at it			0
" @entity50 said @entity11 knows the @entity0 decision - making process and probably never would have agreed to the move without a guarantee of access to @entity10			2
" any appointment in every administration has political angles to it , " @entity50 said			0
" the @entity11 i know is not a shrinking violet			2
if he thinks a decision is a wrong , decision , he 'll have ways of making that clear			0
" @entity11 enjoys widespread popularity in @entity136			2
@entity137 rep. @entity137 , chairman of the @entity138 , praised the choice of @entity11 to head the @entity6 in a statement wednesday			1
however , @entity142 sen. @entity141 of @entity143 , who chairs the @entity144 , indicated @entity11 could face tough questioning from her panel			0
" he is clearly a very accomplished officer and familiar with the parts of the world where many of the threats to our security originate , " @entity141 said , noting that @entity11 has commanded intelligence resources in @entity25 and @entity15			0
" but that is a different role than leading the top civilian intelligence agency			0
i look forward to hearing his vision for the @entity6 and his plans to make sure the @entity6 is collecting the type of intelligence that policymakers need			0
" @entity163 , national security expert from the @entity164 , said @entity11 has " a lot of respect around @entity0 and in the broader international community , which is very important as head of the @entity6			1
" " @entity11 has the gravitas to deal with @entity136 , the administration , and the other executive branch agencies , " @entity163 noted			0
the general literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency techniques by overseeing development of the @entity177 / @entity176			0
in heading the @entity14 - led military missions in both @entity25 and @entity15 , he has experienced and benefited from the @entity6 's support and increased the @entity6 role , including the operation of unmanned drone strikes in @entity26			2
while the @entity6 role in @entity25 , in combating @entity187 and in the @entity26 drone operation " has grown tremendously " under @entity11 ' military command , he also understands the limitations of what the @entity6 can do , @entity183 said			1
that could make his term as @entity6 director " a bit of fresh air " for the agency , @entity183 said , adding : " he will say i 'm very proud of your successes , but there are areas where you can do better and i intend to make this organization better			1
" the last military officer to head the @entity6 was @entity204 , a four - star @entity205 general who took office in uniform in 2006 but then retired his military post in 2008 under " some pressure from @entity136 , " according to @entity116			1
sources including a senior administration official said @entity11 also would retire from the military once confirmed and would be a civilian director of the @entity6			1
" the @entity6 should be a civilian organization , and we want it to have that cultural identity , " @entity116 said			0
asked about the importance of having a civilian at its helm , she said : " i do n't really think it matters			0
it 's dependent on the person and it 's dependent on the mission			0
" @entity1 's @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this story .			0
