-- a @entity2 psychology professor was in hot water thursday for an after - class session in which a couple demonstrated the use of a sex toy			1
university president @entity8 said he was " troubled and disappointed " by the february 21 incident and had ordered an investigation			1
" many members of the @entity2 community are disturbed by what took place on our campus , " @entity8 said in a statement			1
" so am i. " professor @entity18 provided his own account of the optional event in his human sexuality course , saying he wants students to learn about sexual diversity and information from " real people			1
" students who witnessed the incident had been told repeatedly by a guest speaker what was about to happen would be graphic , the professor said in a statement			1
about 100 students chose to attend following a larger lecture , affiliate @entity31 said			2
@entity18 invited speaker @entity34 , co-owner of @entity35 , who brought a woman and a man for a discussion on the female orgasm			0
@entity34 suggested they demonstrate use of high - powered equipment they brought , said the professor , who agreed to the idea			2
" we gave them plenty of warning			2
we had nobody leave at that point , " @entity34 told @entity0 @entity52 affiliate @entity50 , adding the demonstration was meant to be educational			0
" we only got positive feedback , 100 % positive feedback during and after			0
they were smart and asked good questions , intelligent questions and seemed engaged in the idea of human sexuality , " said @entity34			0
but apparently some students at the private school near @entity52 left before or during the demonstration of what the professor described in a statement as " kinky " sex			1
" for me , i 'm glad i did n't see it			0
it was a little too explicit for me , and if i were in the class , if i would have stayed for the demonstration , i probably would have left			2
i know a couple of my friends did get up and leave , " student @entity73 told @entity0 affiliate @entity50			0
@entity77 , another student , said " dr. @entity18 is one of our finest professors here , and his class is about opening people 's minds up			0
" @entity8 said he wants to determine what is appropriate for the classroom			0
" although the incident took place in an after - class session that students were not required to attend and students were advised in advance , several times , of the explicit nature of the activity , i feel it represented extremely poor judgment on the part of our faculty member , " @entity8 said in his statement			1
" i simply do not believe this was appropriate , necessary or in keeping with @entity2 's academic mission			2
" in his statement , @entity18 said it was too early to tell whether he had regrets			0
" i certainly have no regrets concerning @entity2 students , who have demonstrated that they are open - minded grown - ups rather than fragile children , " the professor added .			1
