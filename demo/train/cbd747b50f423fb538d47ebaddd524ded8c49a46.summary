-- the @entity3 , @entity2 , rape case has made national headlines because it represents a perfect storm of inappropriate sexual conduct , high - school football heroes , social media and viral @entity10 videos			1
the case reached some level of closure on sunday as judge @entity14 handed down the juvenile equivalent of a guilty verdict and sentenced the two defendants to what could be years in a juvenile correctional facility as a consequence of their actions on august 11 and 12 of last year			1
two teens found guilty in @entity3 rape case this verdict is a consequence not only of the defendants ' actions that night , but also of decades of change in how society views sexual conduct -- and how the law has evolved in response to this change			1
in this case , a high school girl went to a party and allegedly drank so much that she began slurring her words and was occasionally unresponsive			2
two football stars at the party are accused of taking advantage of her impaired state and engaging in sexual conduct with her			1
a few decades ago , this behavior would probably have been considered inappropriate or " ungentlemanly			0
" today , it brings protesters into the streets and creates a nationwide outcry about sexual abuse			2
the law has evolved as societal norms have changed			1
lots of sexual conduct occurs when one or both participants are intoxicated to some extent			1
the question that the law needs to answer -- but at times struggles to answer -- is at what point one person 's intoxication is so severe that she ( or he , in theory ) is legally unable to give meaningful consent			1
@entity2 law , like that of many states , sets this line at the point at which the victim 's " ability to resist or consent was substantially impaired " by alcohol			1
but how impaired is " substantially impaired " ? in most cases , this question will be answered by a jury			2
( in the @entity3 case , the question was decided by the judge because the case was in juvenile court			2
) this could in theory be a fine line , though after hearing from the witnesses in the @entity3 case , most people today would agree with the court that this victim was well over that line			2
teens treated girl ' like a toy , ' prosecutor says a second lesson from this case is how the ubiquity of social media affects the way criminal cases are investigated and prosecuted			1
the @entity3 case was a dramatic example of this phenomenon : the victim only knew that a crime had been committed against her because she was featured in online photos and posts			2
much of this online material was inadmissible in court			0
( for example , the infamous 12 - minute video in which a person at the party jokes about the rape did much to increase public outrage , but would be rejected as hearsay in court			0
) but the famous photo of the victim in which she is being carried by her wrists and ankles at the party was critical to establishing her level of intoxication			0
the prosecutor also admitted the texts in which one of the defendants stated " she ( the victim ) was like a dead body " and " she could barely move			0
" these texts went a long way toward establishing that the defendants knew that the victim was so impaired that she was unable to consent			0
( statements made by a party in the case are exempt from the hearsay rule			0
) a generation ago , in a case that came to represent a different example of changing social norms , four police officers in @entity138 were brought to trial for assaulting @entity144 only because a bystander happened to have a video camera with him and was able to record the abuse			1
at the time we thought : what a lucky coincidence for the prosecutor ! and what bad luck for the police officers ! but today we should all assume that anything we do could be caught on camera or video			0
meanwhile , many of the things we " say " to others are actually communicated by text , e-mail or online posting			0
digital communication is so commonplace , especially among the younger generation , that those who engage in it are often not aware that they are creating a permanent record of their impressions , opinions and beliefs which could later be used in court			0
in short , the @entity3 case has demonstrated how the rules have changed			1
alcohol will still be present at parties and will still be an element in many sexual encounters -- but now prosecutors , judges and juries will impose their own standards for the acceptable level of impairment			0
and when we commit crimes , the world -- and more importantly , the future jurors in our case -- will be watching			0
rape trial focuses on text messages , cell phone pictures the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

verdict shows that the way society views sexual conduct has changed , @entity196 says
law struggles to define a person is too intoxicated to consent , he says
case also shows how social media affect criminal cases
