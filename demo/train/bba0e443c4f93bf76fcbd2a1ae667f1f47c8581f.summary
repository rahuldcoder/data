@entity1 's landscape has changed in myriad ways since @entity4 launched his design business in 2006			1
back then he was the game 's bulldozer , barging inferior players out of the way in an all - out assault to overhaul @entity12 ' tally of 18 majors and cement his title as the best of all time			2
@entity17 was supposed to form another facet of his burgeoning legacy ; a series of lasting monuments to augment his immense standing within golf			1
except the best laid plans of men often go awry			0
@entity4 has n't won a major since the scandal that engulfed his private life in 2008 and only now , nearly a decade on from the inception of his design arm , is one of his plots open for business			1
with the verdict still out on whether he can recapture that magical form , and fatherhood having altered his outlook on life , the concept of legacy is very much back on the agenda			1
" my goal is to design a limited number of distinct and memorable golf courses , " @entity4 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview			1
" i hope that one day the courses i design will become a lasting contribution to the game that has given me so much			2
" architects forever talk about " moving earth " when it comes to course layout , and the sands have undoubtedly shifted under @entity4 ' feet			1
after locking down 14 majors in a nine - year spell , the former world no. 1 ( and current no. 47 ) has just five top 10 finishes in them across the last five injury - hit seasons			0
the benefits of those spells in rehab has been more time to dedicate to design , culminating in @entity4 ' first opening at @entity67 in @entity68 just before @entity69			1
and though there might have been an eight - year wait for his first completed course , which has been well received , the second should be along within eight months			0
it will represent an important landmark too -- his first opening in the @entity77 , at @entity78 in @entity79			1
the fact that @entity4 ' design operation is finally laying down roots across the @entity83 has taken on an extra significance , with his kids now of an age when they can start to play alongside their all - star dad			1
" he 's obviously won a whole bunch of tournaments and major championships , and they remain very important to him , " says @entity88 , partner of @entity89 -- the company that 's building @entity78 's course -- and a friend of @entity4 for over 20 years			1
" but to be able to take his kids @entity99 and @entity100 to a golf course he 's done is also very important to him			0
" @entity88 agrees that a large slice of @entity17 is about legacy			0
i think he 's very proud and he wants to share that with not only those close to him but also everybody else			0
" to say this is what i 've learned and this is my creativity and now i 'm putting it on the ground for you to see			0
" perhaps unsurprisingly , the junior woods are showing early signs of promise , much to the delight of their proud father			0
" i saw as much of his son @entity99 's swing as i did of his over the time we spent together ( at the opening of the @entity124 course in @entity68 ) , " @entity88 explained			0
" he 'd say ' come look at this -- this is the way i want to swing right here			0
' " @entity4 talks about the old days when he and his father used to go and play the short course in @entity132 and how the short course at @entity78 reminds him of that -- the ability for young girls and boys to come out and play and challenge themselves but also have pure fun			1
" he also built junior tees into the course at @entity78 -- that tells you everything			0
" @entity4 , who began his 2015 season in @entity145 on thursday , is still active in his pursuit of @entity12 ' bumper haul of major titles			1
but he wo n't be trying to match the prolific nature of " the @entity12 " when it comes to rolling courses off the production line at an exponential rate			0
the majority of @entity156 's 380 properties are in the @entity77 while others are dotted around the globe in far flung places such as @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
@entity4 ' dedication to recapturing the heights he reached in the early part of the decade prevent him from taking on too much but even after he retires , he insists he 'll only pick projects that mean something to him			1
" golf course design has always been something that i have been interested in , " @entity4 , who attempted his first design for a magazine competition aged nine , explained			1
" it was n't until my 10th year on tour , after having success on different types of courses all over the world , that i had the knowledge and experience to start @entity17			0
" i see it continuing to be very selective , looking for only the best sites and partners to work with , even after my golf career slows down			0
" that the fruits of @entity4 ' design labor are only starting to emerge has much to do with the financial downturn of 2008			1
several projects have been on the table for some time ; the cliffs in @entity194 and @entity195 in @entity68 are yet to yield a completion date			0
a much - trumpeted project in @entity198 was shelved in 2011 due to funding problems , though @entity4 recently announced he was teaming up with @entity200 for another go at building in the @entity202			1
and while he has been enlisted to build another course at @entity67 , one industry expert thinks @entity4 needs to go further if his design arm is to enhance his standing in the game			1
" i ca n't see @entity4 's design business affecting his legacy unless he gets a project that really moves the dial , " @entity208 , editor of @entity210 , told @entity2			1
" either a site where he and his team can build something that is universally viewed as one of the best courses in the world -- which presupposes they have the ability to do so , something that has n't be proven yet -- or alternatively they do something that has a real impact on golf 's development			0
" with the best will in the world , you do n't change golf by building extremely expensive resort courses in @entity67 , an ultra-high end residential project in @entity79 or a monster expensive course to be run by @entity200 in @entity198			2
" @entity237 also believes @entity4 might also benefit -- not just himself , but also the game of golf itself -- by looking at designing a course in the @entity243 countries			2
" i would like to see @entity4 take on a low budget project in an emerging market , " he added			2
" a @entity4 - branded course in @entity247 , or @entity248 -- but a proper , public access , cheap golf course and not a fancy housing development -- could really impact on how golf grows in that market			2
" those projects in developing nations may well come down the line but listening to @entity4 , it is clear he believes @entity78 could enter the pantheon of great @entity77 courses when it opens for business			1
" @entity78 has one of the best natural settings for golf i have seen , " he said			0
" with its changes in elevation , the beautiful pines and hardwoods , @entity78 is reminiscent of the pinelands of @entity266 and the @entity267			0
" the opportunity is here to create a golf course unlike any other in the @entity79 area , and our goal is for it to be among the best in the nation			2
" due for completion in october , @entity4 has been making regular visits to the site near the small town of @entity280 in @entity281			1
@entity88 says he has been struck by @entity4 ' willingness to take other opinions on board and how in tune he is with those players at the other end of the skill spectrum to himself			2
" @entity78 is spectacular and i think it 's incredibly special that this is his first course in the @entity77 , " @entity88 said			1
" when i first talked to @entity4 he mentioned the playability ; this one cut of turf , how you create great vistas and how all levels of players can find some success			2
" when @entity4 goes in , he goes all the way			2
he does n't do anything half way , he 's an all - in guy and that 's reflected in his work ethic on and off the course			0
" this is important to him -- he feels like he 's designing golf courses that will be meaningful because it will encourage people to play the game			0
" at @entity78 he 's taken it to an even further level where he 's designed this playground section , a nine - hole short course that is spectacular			0
he 's also designed four little loops that help if you only had an hour or two to play			0
" not only is he tackling golf course design from the angle of making it playable he 's also tackling it from people 's time commitments to be able to play , whether it is someone who wants a couple hours on the course , a corporate person entertaining a guest or a father and daughter			2
" he 's taken time investment and really put it into his design so you ask ' is the guy in tune ? ' when a designer thinks that way i think he 's in tune			2
" still , any jobbing golfer standing on the first tee of a @entity4 - designed course could be forgiven for sweating with a mixture of fear and reverence			1
@entity4 ' litany of career titles have been secured on a collection of the world 's most fiendish courses , giving him ample ammunition when it came to sketching out his own ideas			1
but his emphasis on " playability " essentially says to the amateur -- ' i 've got your back			0
' " i have played enough pro-ams over the years to know not every golfer is a scratch handicap , " @entity4 said			1
" designing golf courses that players of all skill levels find enjoyable is very important to me			0
the biggest compliment that a designer can receive is if a golfer ca n't wait to play his golf course again			0
" @entity88 is happy to talk legacy , but he 's also keen to stress that @entity4 still has plenty left in his playing locker			1
having watched him take on a collection of journalists during the opening of @entity124 , @entity88 says @entity4 ' swing has its " speed and power back			2
" " i 'm absolutely backing @entity4 to bag some more majors , " he said , ominously			2
" it 's exciting to see him play this way			0
the appetite is still there -- it 's like he 's never eaten before			0

@entity4 ' design business is to form a significant part of the golfer 's legacy
despite starting the company in 2006 his first course opened in *december* 2014
@entity4 first course in the @entity77 is due to open in @entity79 in october
