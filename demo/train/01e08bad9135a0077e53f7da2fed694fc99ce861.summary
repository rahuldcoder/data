" the company said its offices worldwide will hold a minute of silence wednesday " as a mark of respect for all of those who lost their lives at @entity13			2
" at least 37 hostages were killed in the four - day ordeal , which began december 16 and ended saturday			1
" many of us have friends and colleagues , both in @entity1 and in other companies , who have worked at @entity13 or in similar facilities , " @entity39 said in a company statement			1
" we are all thinking of our missing colleagues , those who endured the ordeal and their loved ones			2
" the plant employed about 790 people , including 134 foreign workers -- among them @entity72 , one of three @entity73 known to have been killed			1
family members said @entity72 , ever the family man , was excited about the job			2
he got 28 days off for every 28 days he put in , time he could spend with his wife and two children in @entity78 , @entity79			1
yes , it was in a remote natural gas facility in @entity6 , but @entity72 assured his family it was safe			1
and it was in @entity85 , a place the 57 - year - old seemed to love			0
" he felt something there , " his daughter , @entity87 , told reporters tuesday			0
" he was so excited to go there			0
i do n't really know why , but he just loved it			0
" but 10 days after he returned to the complex from a visit home , terrorists sped in on pickups , overtook the compound and made hostages of its workers			2
" it 's just unfair , " @entity72 's brother , @entity103 , said tuesday			2
" my brother did n't deserve to die			2
" in addition to @entity72 , @entity73 @entity106 and @entity107 also died			0
seven @entity73 citizens survived the crisis , the @entity109 said			0
it did not elaborate , citing privacy concerns			0
like @entity72 , @entity106 , too , felt safe working there			0
he said " we 're in a compound in the middle of nowhere , and we 've got security , and i 'll be fine , " @entity106 's former neighbor , @entity115 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity120 in @entity121			2
" i guess you ca n't really be secure any place			0
" opinion : @entity6 hostage crisis shows jihadists on rise meanwhile , @entity6 authorities hailed as a hero the only one of their compatriots among the hostages who died in the attack			1
while few details about his contribution were available tuesday , @entity6 authorities said he had raised the alarm that allowed plant workers to shut down operations and go into hiding			1
militants shot the man between the eyes just as he alerted plant workers of the attack , @entity6 prime minister @entity141 said			1
@entity146 , the @entity30 branch of the terrorist movement , has claimed responsibility for the attack			0
in @entity150 , @entity109 spokeswoman @entity149 said that @entity73 officials " do n't have any reason to doubt " the group 's involvement			0
@entity149 said @entity150 has no reason to believe any @entity73 are among those still unaccounted for			2
@entity6 said the attack was retaliation for its decision to let @entity160 to use its airspace for an offensive against @entity164 militants in neighboring @entity165			1
but regional analysts said that would appear to be unlikely ; the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned in the few days between @entity160 's intervention in @entity165 and the attack on the gas plant less than a week later			2
the @entity6 government has said the attackers came from @entity6 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity165 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			1
@entity73 and @entity6 officials are still trying to confirm the identities of those involved , according to a federal law enforcement official -- and it was unclear whether the terrorist identified as a @entity176 was carrying authentic or false identification			1
" the level of co-operation between two countries has been good , " the official added			0
the @entity187 has additional investigators in @entity6 , where there is an established legal attache office , but authorities declined to say how many agents are there or identify their location			1
@entity194 : family seeks answers after @entity78 man killed in @entity6 @entity6 officials said the attackers drew on the expertise of a driver from @entity175 who had once worked at the plant			1
one former hostage , @entity204 , told state - run @entity206 broadcaster cctv about militants flooding into the compound , taking it over bit by bit , searching door to door for workers			2
he also described rescue efforts			0
" the experience was too terrible			0
i heard the sounds of gunshot , bullets hitting doors , " he told @entity205			0
" i heard the governmental forces and terrorists fighting in the distance			0
judging from the sounds of gunfire , the fighting was very intense			0
" the @entity6 initially moved in on thursday after concluding the militants planned to blow up the gas installation and flee to @entity165 with the foreigners as hostages			1
the incursion succeeded in freeing some hostages -- but not all -- and several of them died			0
@entity72 survived thursday 's raid			2
and if his family knew him at all , he was likely biding his time , coolly trying to find a way to help himself and others out of the unthinkable predicament they found themselves in			2
' we felt in our hearts that he was coming home ' " he would n't be the person who is crying and screaming and begging , " @entity243 said			0
and after the initial exhilarating news , the family felt sure he would pull through			0
" we all believed , we felt in our hearts that he was coming home , " his daughter said			0
but then , on saturday , @entity6 special forces backed by helicopter gunships raided the plant for a second time			1
they finished off the militants but were unable to save the remaining hostages			0
militants may have executed them , @entity103 said he 'd been told			0
the news , @entity243 said , was " devastating			0
" bloody @entity6 hostage crisis ends after ' final ' assault @entity103 said he 's angry with the terrorists who took the compound his brother thought was safe , resulting in the deaths of people who had traveled there merely to make a better living for their families			1
but he said things maybe could have been different had @entity6 allowed @entity73 or @entity38 special operations forces to take over			1
maybe , @entity103 said , the @entity272 or @entity38 's @entity274 commandos could have taken out the militants while sparing the hostages			0
" we all feel it could have been handled differently , " he said			0
however , @entity6 's @entity279 said security forces were compelled to intervene quickly " to avoid a bloody turning point of events in this extremely dangerous situation			1
" officials said monday that had the terrorists succeeded in blowing up the plant , it would have caused death and destruction in a 5 - kilometer ( 3.1 mile ) radius			2
on tuesday , @entity73 officials reiterated their support for @entity6 officials			1
" the blame for this tragedy rests with the terrorists who carried it out , " @entity295 spokesman @entity294 said			1
nations scramble to account for missing after @entity6 hostage crisis as the family awaits the return of @entity72 's body , and more answers about how he died , @entity103 said he 's determined not to let his brother 's legacy die with him			1
he said he intends to press @entity308 to keep up the fight against terrorism			0
" i 'll be angry for a long time , " he said			1
