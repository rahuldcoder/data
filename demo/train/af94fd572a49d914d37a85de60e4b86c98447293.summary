-- @entity3 's @entity2 thriller " @entity4 " is having quite the box office run			1
after debuting at number two with $ 19.5 million , @entity8 ' @entity7 contender dropped by just 16 percent last weekend to $ 16.4 million			1
this weekend , the film notched yet another impressive achievement : it climbed to number one with an estimated $ 12.4 million ( a 25 percent drop ) in its third frame , becoming the first film since " @entity16 " to hop to first place in its third weekend			1
" @entity4 , " which cost $ 45 million to make , has now earned $ 60.8 million total , and thanks to terrific word - of - mouth ( the film earned an " a + " cinemascore grade ) and early awards buzz , @entity4 is eyeing a $ 100 million finish			1
though it is running a tad behind @entity3 's last directorial effort , @entity28 , which had earned $ 64.1 million at the same point in its run en route to a $ 92.2 million finish , @entity4 is enjoying much better week - to - week holds			1
( " @entity28 , " which opened higher " @entity4 " with $ 23.8 million , fell 38 percent to $ 9.7 million in its third weekend			1
) @entity36 's $ 85 million @entity35 - voiced effort " @entity37 " jumped two spots into second place with $ 9.5 million in its fifth weekend			1
the film , which has scored slim drops since its robust $ 42.5 million debut in september , only fell 27 percent this weekend — the final frame before " @entity44			1
" it will be interesting to see whether @entity45 holds up in the holiday 's wake , but it 's already a monster hit			0
with $ 130.4 million total , @entity45 is already @entity36 's highest grossing film ever , above @entity51 , which grossed $ 124.9 million in 2009			1
it 's also given @entity35 a much - needed career boost following his back - to - back misfires , @entity56 and @entity57			0
the pricey novel adaptation " @entity59 " finished in third place with a weak $ 9.4 million			1
remarkably , that was the best start of any of this weekend 's newcomers , which is a testament to the weakness of the frame			2
the heady drama , which follows six separate storylines and stars @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 in various roles , genders , and races , proved too difficult for mainstream audiences to latch onto			0
audiences , which were 77 percent above the age of 25 , issued the film a " c + " @entity80			1
for @entity8 , " @entity59 ' " failure is not the worst news — the studio acquired domestic distribution rights for a reported $ 15 million and marketed the film — but the real losers here are the @entity89 siblings and the foreign investors who financed the project			2
" @entity59 " cost a whopping $ 100 million , and it has no chance of making that money back — at least not in the @entity95			0
another loser ? @entity69 , whose box office clout has all but disappeared in recent years			1
@entity59 arrives on the heels of two other box office underperformers : " @entity99 " ( $ 31.9 million ) and " @entity100 " ( $ 35.6 million )			1
in fourth , " @entity102 " dropped by a massive 70 percent — a high point for the @entity105 franchise ( @entity106 dropped by 60 percent in its second weekend			1
@entity101 fell 65 percent ) — to $ 8.7 million			2
after ten days , @entity108 's $ 5 million found footage sequel has earned $ 42.6 million , which is still $ 10 million less than @entity101 grossed in its first weekend			2
" @entity114 " took fifth place , sliding 40 percent to $ 8.0 million , which gives @entity112 's $ 45 million action thriller a $ 117.4 million total			1
though the @entity117 vehicle is a huge hit , it 's becoming clear that it will not surpass the final $ 145 million domestic gross of the original " taken			0
" in its fourth weekend , " taken , " which opened with half of what taken 2 made , earned $ 11.3 million			2
" @entity114 " is falling much faster			0

@entity128 's $ 20 million videogame adaptation / horror sequel " @entity129 : @entity131 " started in sixth place with $ 8.0 million			2
the original " @entity129 " surprised analysts with a strong $ 20.2 million debut in 2006 , but it clearly did n't leave enough of an impression on audiences for them to show up for a sequel six years later			0
crowds gave the film an uninspiring " @entity141			2
two other films did even worse			0
