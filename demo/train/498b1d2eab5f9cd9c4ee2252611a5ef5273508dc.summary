-- an advisory panel to the @entity3 on friday voted 19 - 10 to recommend placing tighter restrictions on hydrocodone , an ingredient found in popular prescription drugs including @entity7 , @entity7 and @entity7			1
if the panel 's advice is adopted by @entity3 , it would put hydrocodone on par with prescription painkillers like oxycodone , morphine , and methadone -- drugs with high abuse potential that can lead to severe physical dependence			1
with its vote , the advisory panel is suggesting that hydrocodone be moved from its current classification as a @entity24 drug -- a drug with moderate abuse potential -- to a more restrictive @entity26 classification			1
among a wide field of potent prescription painkillers -- which the @entity30 says are fueling an epidemic of abuse in the @entity33 -- hydrocodone may have been flying under the radar among doctors			2
" most doctors are under the impression that @entity7 ( whose main ingredient is hydrocodone ) is less addictive than other prescription painkillers , " said dr. @entity36 , president of physicians for @entity38			2
" when you wonder why your dentist gives you 40 hydrocodone for a toothache , or your knee doctor prescribes far more than he should , that 's because they 're under the impression that it 's not addictive as @entity52			1
" concerns about generic painkillers increase the panel 's advice , if adopted by the @entity3 , would limit how much hydrocodone a patient could get between doctor visits			1
it would also limit refills -- @entity24 drugs can be refilled up to five times , while @entity26 drugs are not eligible for refills , according to the @entity67			1
but pain patient advocacy groups and pharmaceutical companies , among others , fear that reclassification will make it harder for patients to get medications they need			2
" the @entity3 advisory committee is considering a proposal that could make it harder for patients with legitimate health needs to obtain essential medications , " according to a statement by the @entity81 , which represents pharmacy owners and employees			1
@entity84 is the most prescribed painkiller in the @entity33 : 131 million prescriptions for hydrocodone were written in 2010 , according to @entity88 , a health care information company			2
that number far outpaces the medical need for the drug , said @entity36			0
" we 've had a medical community that has been massively overprescribing the drug , " said @entity36			0
" there is very little difference between a hydrocodone molecule and a heroin molecule			0
we need doctors to prescribe much more cautiously			0
" but it is up for question whether rescheduling hydrocodone will deter doctors from prescribing , or make it very difficult for patients to obtain it , said dr. @entity107 , an emergency - room physician in @entity108 , @entity109			0
" you 'd like for providers who write prescriptions for it to think twice , you 'd like people who use it to think twice , " said @entity107 , also a past president of the @entity109 chapter of the @entity111			0
" unfortunately i think way too many providers do n't draw that distinction very often			0
" prescription drug deaths : two stories and while @entity107 does not wholly agree that reclassifying hydrocodone will necessarily change habits , he says that the move does underline a dire need to change the overall perception of painkillers			1
" @entity129 's starting to open their eyes that there is a problem associated ( with prescription painkillers ) , " said @entity107			0
" if you make a move like this ... it 's out there in the conversation about this epidemic , and that 's a good thing			0
" an @entity3 spokeswoman could not confirm when the @entity3 would act on the panel 's recommendation			1
the @entity67 will make the ultimate decision on whether to reschedule the drug .			0
