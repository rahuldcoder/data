a dramatic shootout between authorities and suspected cartel gunmen at a @entity4 seaside resort this month has ties to a botched @entity7 gun operation			1
a @entity7 official said tuesday that investigators have traced at least one firearm recovered at a december 18 gunfight in @entity12 , across from the @entity14 border , to @entity15			1
that 's the disastrous operation run by agents in the @entity19 office of the @entity20			0
agents allowed suspected gun smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms with the goal of trying to find and prosecute high - level traffickers			0
they could n't track the firearms and most are believed to have ended up with cartels and gangsters in @entity4			1
many have turned up at crime scenes in @entity4 and the @entity7 , including at a shooting that killed a @entity7 border agent in 2010			1
the shootout in @entity12 , also called @entity12 by @entity14 tourists , two weeks ago left at least five suspected cartel gunmen dead , including possibly a high level @entity38 chief , according to @entity4 authorities			1
witnesses reported hours of shooting and grenade explosions , with @entity4 authorities using helicopters to attack fleeing suspected cartel gunmen on the ground			2
guns recovered at such scenes are routinely checked with the @entity20 's tracing lab to try to determine their origin			0
at least one @entity52 style firearm was found , and @entity7 investigators identified it as one that was allowed to be sold to suspected traffickers as part of @entity15 , according to the @entity7 official			1
the @entity20 , in a statement , said : " @entity20 has accepted responsibility for the mistakes made in the @entity15 investigation and at the attorney general 's direction we have taken appropriate and decisive action to ensure that these errors will not be repeated			0
and we acknowledge that , regrettably , firearms related to the @entity15 investigation will likely continue to be recovered at future crime scenes			0
" guns from @entity15 have turned up at other high - profile killings in @entity4 , including those of the brother of a @entity4 state prosecutor and of a beauty queen			2
the @entity15 operation gave rise to more than a year of political controversy for the @entity78			0
rep. @entity79 , @entity80 , and sen. @entity81 , @entity82 , led a congressional probe to determine how it came to be approved			1
eventually , @entity85 @entity84 sanctioned attorney general @entity86 for contempt of @entity88 in a legal dispute over the @entity85 's refusal to turn over documents			0
@entity86 has said tactics used in @entity15 never should have been allowed			0
a @entity78 inspector general report cleared @entity86 of wrongdoing and placed most blame on officials at the @entity20 and the @entity19 @entity7 attorney 's office for failing to properly oversee the agents running the operation			2
@entity81 , in a statement tuesday , said : " in @entity15 , the @entity4 drug cartels found an easy way to supplement their own illegal ways			1
worse yet , the @entity106 administration has yet to publicly hold anyone accountable for this disastrous policy			2
unfortunately , guns from @entity15 will be found in operations like this for years to come			0

sen. @entity81 says no one has been held accountable
