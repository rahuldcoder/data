one month before the @entity0 begin in the @entity2 resort town of @entity3 -- and in the shadow of last month 's deadly bombings in @entity6 -- a huge security operation has swung into gear			1
a special exclusion zone went into force tuesday under which only @entity3 - marked vehicles , emergency or specially accredited intelligence service cars will be allowed into the wider @entity3 area			1
air traffic and sea access will be restricted , and everyone going into the zone will have to go through heavy security and identity checks			1
@entity22 is pouring huge resources into ensuring that the @entity24 , seen as a flagship project of president @entity26 , go off without incident			2
two bombings in 24 hours last month in @entity6 , one targeting the city 's main train station and the second a trolley bus , raised concerns of a potential threat to the @entity3 event			1
no group has to date claimed responsibility for the attacks , but suspicion has fallen on @entity39 separatist groups			2
a bitter battle for an independent @entity39 , lasting almost two decades , spawned an insurgency that has spilled into neighboring republics in the @entity44 region , including @entity45			2
@entity39 warlord @entity46 , leader of the @entity48 group , last summer called on his followers to do what they can to disrupt the @entity24			2
he claims they will be held on the graves of @entity54 occupants of @entity3 , who he says were driven out by @entity2 imperial forces in the 19th century			1
despite the shockwaves of the @entity6 attack , @entity58 president @entity57 said he was confident that @entity22 would keep the @entity0 safe			1
and , of course , @entity22 is not alone in suffering a terror attack a short time before hosting an @entity64 event			2
the @entity65 was still reeling from the september 11 , 2001 , attacks when it hosted the @entity24 in 2002			1
bombings in @entity22 's @entity6 : what might be behind the attacks ? @entity70 suicide bombers the bombings in @entity6 , which lies about 400 miles ( 650 kilometers ) from @entity3 but is a major rail hub for passengers traveling to the @entity75 resort , were not the first such attacks @entity22 has faced			1
in 2002 , @entity39 militants took 900 theatergoers hostage at the @entity79 in @entity80			1
@entity2 security forces stormed the building , killing all the rebels , but 130 hostages also lost their lives			0
in may 2004 , a bomb planted months earlier during construction ripped through a stadium in the @entity39 capital of @entity90 , killing the republic 's president , @entity91			0
a horrifying attack by militants on a school in @entity96 , @entity97 , came only four months later			2
when the siege ended , more than 330 people had died , half of them children			0
more recently , @entity46 's group claimed responsibility for the deadly 2011 bombing of @entity105 in @entity80 , the 2010 bombings of the capital 's subway and the 2009 bombing of the high - speed nevsky express train			2
@entity111 , an investigative journalist who specializes in the @entity2 intelligence services , told @entity113 he believes @entity22 's militants no longer have the freedom of movement for this kind of large - scale terror attack -- but he 's not confident the intelligence services are prepared for the threat of lone suicide bombers			2
" my basic explanation is that they 're still inspired by the @entity64 in @entity80 in 1980 , " he said			0
" they seem to be obsessed with the idea of controlling everything and everybody , but i do n't think that 's the same thing as what you need to prevent a terror attack			0
" retired police col. @entity132 has more faith in the abilities of his former intelligence counterparts			0
" when the tactics of terrorists are changing , the anti-terrorist units have to change their tactics as well			0
and the utmost means in this field is intelligence , first of all , " he said			0
" it 's not that easy to penetrate those cells , but still -- it is possible , it is done , it is done daily			0
" bombings raise questions about @entity0 security soft targets ? what alarms many security analysts is not so much the threat to @entity3 but that posed to softer targets farther afield			1
@entity158 , editor of @entity159 and a @entity22 expert , said the @entity161 , venues and infrastructure , such as the new rail link built to connect the @entity75 resort with the mountain venues , will be enormously well protected			2
" that would be a prime target , but the extraordinarily high level of security put in place means that it would be very difficult for the militants to undertake a successful attack for one of these sites , " he said			2
there is a slightly higher risk of attack on softer targets in the wider @entity3 area , @entity158 said			1
these could include train stations , hotels and major public squares			0
an attack on such a target " could again cause major disruption to the @entity24 , " he said			0
however , it would still be difficult for militants to travel into this security zone			1
@entity158 sees the greatest risk as being outside the immediate @entity3 area , particularly softer targets such as transport infrastructure not directly linked to the @entity24			1
while such an attack would not directly disrupt the @entity24 , it " would have a significant psychological impact and would to a certain extent overshadow them , " he said			0
in the wake of the @entity6 attacks , @entity2 officials said they did not intend to change their security plans for @entity3 -- since they were already so developed -- but vigilance will likely be stepped up elsewhere			1
all in all , @entity22 plans to deploy some 37,000 security personnel , according to the @entity205			0
by comparison , 12,000 police and security personnel were deployed for the @entity209 , with 18,000 troops on standby , @entity158 said			0
" it 's a smaller games , and it 's got twice as many personnel , " @entity158 said of @entity3			1
" it 's obviously a very , very significant deployment there			0
" @entity26 visits victims of @entity6 blasts @entity218 threat @entity219 , director of the @entity220 , agrees that " @entity3 is perhaps the best protected area in @entity22 " and will be difficult for militants to penetrate			1
but he said @entity22 faces an " ever - present " threat despite some lulls between attacks			0
" essentially @entity22 has been living under the threat of terrorist attacks since the 1990s , " he said			0
this was initially linked to the war in @entity39 , he said , but since then has morphed from a separatist movement into a " threat which is of a civilizational nature " from people who reject modern @entity22 and want to pursue a jihadist agenda			0
" that unfortunately remains and will continue to be part of everyday life in @entity22 for , i think , the foreseeable future , " he said			0
@entity219 , who formerly served in the @entity240 and @entity2 armed forces , sees the threat as greatest in southern @entity22 cities such as @entity6 , which are relatively close to @entity3 but not as well protected as @entity80 and @entity243			1
" @entity22 is very much accessible to the jihadists , but they can strike anywhere on the @entity246 , on central @entity22 , " he said			2
the twin bombings in @entity6 caused grief and disbelief in @entity22 , he said , especially after the second attack -- staged when security had been stepped up			1
but the @entity24 are still a great source of pride for many @entity2 as only the second @entity0 held on @entity2 soil , he said , and there has been no call for people to stay away			1
" it reminds me of the @entity258 , " he said			0
" in the wake of that attack , a lot of people came out and said , ' we will run in the marathon , we will come out in the street to demonstrate to the terrorists that they can not intimidate us			0
' " i felt some of that in the reaction around the world to the @entity6 bombings			1
" ' it 's better to lose money than to lose our lives ' it 's not yet clear what impact the security concerns will have on the number of foreign visitors to @entity3			1
but @entity279 , 24 , from @entity280 , is one person who has canceled his trip to the @entity0 in the wake of the @entity6 attacks			1
he and his boyfriend , both keen to see the ice skating and snowboarding , had been planning the trip for a long time , @entity279 said			2
but the shock of the bombings , plus @entity279 's disquiet over @entity22 's position on gay rights following the passage of a controversial " anti-gay propaganda " law last year , led them to make the difficult decision to cancel			2
" with these attacks , i felt it was another sign we should not go for our safety , not just for us being lgbt but for our safety in general , " @entity279 told @entity113			0
he was able to get a refund on his @entity3 hotel booking but stands to lose the $ 4,000 he spent on flights and event tickets for himself and his partner			1
@entity279 , who runs an underwear business , also had a business meeting scheduled in @entity80 to coincide with the @entity3 trip but will lose out on the chance to launch his product in @entity22 for the moment			1
@entity279 said he might consider traveling to @entity22 in the future , but only if he feels safe there and if its stance toward the lesbian , gay and transgender community changes			0
" how we feel is , it 's better to lose that money than to lose our lives , " he said			0
" it 's very sad , we would love to go , but everything surrounding @entity22 right now does n't look very well			0

an exclusion zone goes into force in @entity3 with one month to go before the @entity0
restrictions are imposed on air , sea and road traffic in the @entity3 area
experts say @entity3 is well protected but warn militants could strike softer targets
one @entity65 man says he canceled his @entity3 trip after bombings in @entity6
