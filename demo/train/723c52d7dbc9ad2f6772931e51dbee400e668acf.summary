-- a @entity2 - inspired effort to tinker with the @entity4 machinery in @entity5 is raising alarm bells among @entity7 who fear it could doom the party 's chances of winning the @entity11 in 2008			1
a @entity2 - led group submitted a proposal to state attorney general @entity14 that could sway the ' 08 presidential race			1
@entity7 have come to rely on @entity5 's block of 55 electoral votes -- the largest haul available in any state -- as part of their arithmetic to win the presidency with a majority in the @entity4			1
a group called @entity27 has submitted a ballot initiative to state attorney general @entity14 that would change the current statewide winner - take - all system to a formula based on congressional districts			1
@entity2 say the idea is aimed at attracting presidential candidates to campaign in @entity5 , which they rarely do because the statewide vote traditionally leans @entity7			1
opponents call the proposal an attempt to grab @entity7 votes			2
under the proposal , the winning candidate in each of the state 's 53 congressional districts would get one electoral vote , with two votes going to the statewide winner			1
supporters want to put the proposal on the ballot for next june 's state primary , which would put the change into effect for the 2008 election			2
do to so , supporters will have to collect about 434,000 petition signatures from registered voters by november 13 , according to the secretary of state 's office			0
in the 2006 election , @entity5 elected 34 democrats and 19 republicans to the @entity11			0
had the proposed system been in effect in 2004 , president @entity63 would have captured 22 of @entity5 's electoral votes			1
the extra electoral votes would have eliminated @entity63 's need to carry the pivotal state of @entity70 to win re-election			1
" this would all but guarantee that the @entity2 nominee would get 20 extra @entity4 votes , which could certainly impact the outcome of the election , " said @entity72 , a @entity2 strategist			0
and that is exactly what has @entity7 crying foul			0
" the @entity2 are doing this in @entity5 because they want a chunk of our vote , " said @entity81 , a @entity7 strategist			1
the ballot initiative was submitted by @entity87 , a @entity88 election lawyer who is also general counsel for @entity89 gov. @entity89			0
the purpose of the change is to make @entity5 more relevant in presidential elections by forcing candidates to campaign in the state , according to the initiative			2
" because this is a reliable @entity7 state , none of the presidential candidates -- @entity2 or @entity99 -- ever shows up in @entity5 , " @entity72 said			1
on the other side of the divide , democrats argue that @entity5 should n't make such a change when the vast majority of other states still operate under a winner - take - all system			1
" this is very fair if it 's universal around the country , " @entity81 said			0
" it is patently absurd it if only takes place in certain states			0
" under the @entity116 , each state gets a number of electoral votes equal to its representation in @entity121 , including both representatives and senators			2
currently , 48 states award all of their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the largest number of votes			0
two states -- @entity131 and @entity132 -- have adopted the system that is being proposed for @entity5 , assigning their electoral votes based on who wins individual congressional districts , with the statewide winner getting the two votes derived from senators			1
but this has not generated controversy because both states have just a handful of votes , and the results have never resulted in splitting them between candidates			0
ironically , while @entity7 are up in arms in @entity5 over the idea of changing the @entity4 rules , their compatriots in @entity2 - leaning @entity150 have floated the idea of adopting the @entity131 - @entity132 system for their state			1
however , national @entity7 leaders have tried to discourage that effort , because of concerns it would be difficult to support such a change in @entity150 , where it would help the party , while opposing it in @entity5			2
the change also would help @entity7 much less in @entity150 than it would hurt in @entity5			2
in 2004 , the @entity7 presidential nominee , sen. @entity166 , would have garnered three more votes in @entity150 , while losing 22 in @entity5			2
the disputed 2000 election , in which @entity63 won the electoral vote while losing the popular vote , has generated a flurry of proposals to abolish or alter the @entity4 , both at the federal and state level			0
in 2006 , @entity176 voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have divided up the electoral vote pie in proportion to each candidates ' share of the popular vote			0
a group called @entity184 also is lobbying state legislatures to adopt a system where all of a state 's electoral votes would be pledged to the winner of the national popular vote -- an idea which , if adopted by states holding a majority of electoral votes , would ensure that the popular vote winner always became president			1
while @entity184 says its plan has been introduced in 47 states , @entity197 is the only one so far to pass it			0
and the change wo n't go into effect in @entity197 until it gains approval in enough states to ensure that the popular vote winner would take the @entity11			0
e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this report .			0
