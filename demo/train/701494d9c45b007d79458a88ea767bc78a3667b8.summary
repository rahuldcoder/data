-- a scathing review of policing in @entity3 found that in a city where about a quarter of the population is @entity7 , two - thirds of police stops involved black residents , according to the @entity11			1
the report , titled " black , @entity13 , and @entity14 , " is based on the preliminary results of a study commissioned by the @entity17 -- which analyzed 204,000 " @entity19 and observation " ( @entity21 ) reports from police officers between 2007 and 2010			1
" the fact that blacks make up about 25 % of @entity3 's population , but are stopped 63 % of the time raises serious concerns of racially biased policing , " said @entity22 , an attorney with the @entity23			1
the findings come in the wake of troubling incidents across the nation in which police actions disproportionately targeted african - americans in cities like @entity37 , where questionable police tactics have been captured on video			1
additionally , the controversial shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in @entity43 , @entity44 , has drawn national attention to the issue of police / community relations			2
released jointly by the @entity11 and its branch in @entity50 , the report found that @entity17 gave no justification for 75 % of the encounters with citizens and listed the reason for the stop simply as " investigate person			1
" only 2.5 % of the encounters lead to seizure of contraband , according to the @entity11			1
" ' investigate person ' can not provide a constitutionally permissible reason for stopping or frisking someone , " said @entity60 , legal director at the @entity11			2
" it only describes what the officer decided to do			0
it basically means : ' because i said so			0
' " the @entity17 said it has made significant changes to procedures since 2011 , including improved documentation and supervision of stops			1
" over the past month , the @entity17 has held three separate meetings with the @entity11 to receive feedback and engage the organization in the solutions , " the department said in a statement			1
" as a result of the meetings , the @entity17 agrees that publishing @entity21 statistics going forward is necessary , and the @entity17 is working toward personalizing interactions between officers and citizens			2
" the report said that @entity3 police failed to show that its stops and frisks produced results			1
" in a four - year span , the @entity17 targeted @entity93 for roughly 129,600 encounters -- 63.3 % of 204,739 -- that did not result in arrest , " the report said			1
@entity60 said the findings were clear evidence of racial bias by @entity3 officers			2
" this practice contradicts the principle of equal protection under the law , which is guaranteed by both the @entity105 and @entity106 , " he said			0
" we hope that we can work collaboratively with the @entity17 to address this problem			2
" a report released in @entity37 last year found that officers there also disproportionately targeted minorities during stops			2
nearly nine out of 10 people " stopped and frisked " under a controversial @entity115 policy in 2011 were @entity7 or @entity118 , the @entity115 report said			0
the @entity37 report showed that of 685,724 stops made by police that year , 53 % of those questioned were black , 34 % were @entity123 , 9 % were white and 3 % were @entity124			1
the citywide population in 2011 was 23.4 % black , 29.4 % @entity118 , 12.9 % @entity124 , and 34.3 % non-hispanic white , according to the report			1
opinion : @entity129 needs to lead on racial profiling legislation in @entity3 , the @entity11 has requested that police release statistics on police - civilian encounters on a quarterly basis			1
it also recommended that officers who are involved in stops wear body cameras during interactions with the public -- a practice now in place in @entity43 , @entity44 , after unarmed teenager @entity13 was shot and killed by a white police officer			0
a spate of incidents across the nation has drawn attention to police tactics			0
@entity43 police officer @entity149 shot and killed the 18 - year - old in the middle of the day on august 9 after telling @entity13 and a friend to get out of the street			0
a grand jury is expected to decide by mid-november whether @entity149 will be charged criminally for the shooting , which has sparked weeks of unrest			0
on @entity158 in @entity37 on july 17 , @entity157 raised both hands in the air and told officers who approached him about illegally selling cigarettes to not touch him			0
seconds later , a video taken by a bystander showed an officer grab @entity157 from behind in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk , rolling him onto his stomach			0
the video showed @entity157 lying on the ground motionless			0
an asthmatic and father of six , @entity157 was later declared dead at a nearby hospital			0
an @entity176 family is suing a city and the local police after officers smashed a car window to stun and arrest a black passenger during a traffic stop			0
the family said police pulled them over because the two front passengers were not wearing a seat belt on september 24 in @entity187 , @entity176 .			0

in @entity3 , 25 % of population is black , but 63 % of police stops involve blacks , study finds
@entity11 report is based on study commissioned by @entity17
findings come in the wake of troubling police incidents across the country
