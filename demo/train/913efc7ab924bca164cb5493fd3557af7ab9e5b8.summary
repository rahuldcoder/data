-- it 's like a chair that is n't there , but magically appears whenever you need it			1
it 's called the @entity7 and you wear it on your legs like an exoskeleton : when it 's not activated , you can walk normally or even run			1
and then , at the touch of a button , it locks into place and you can sit down on it			1
like a chair that is now there			1
" the idea came from wanting to sit anywhere and everywhere , and from working in a @entity26 packaging factory when i was 17 , " says @entity20 , the 29 - year old ceo and co-founder of noonee , the @entity28 - based startup behind the device , " standing for hours on end causes a lot of distress to lower limbs , but most workers get very few breaks and chairs are rarely provided , because they take up too much space			1
so i thought that the best idea was to strap an unobtrusive chair directly to myself			2
" the device never touches the ground , which makes it easier to wear : a belt secures it to the hips and it has straps that wrap around the thighs			2
a variable damper engages and supports the bodyweight , which is directed towards the heels of the shoes			2
these are specially designed and part of the mechanism , but an alternate version works with any footwear and touches the ground only when in a stationary position			2
the user just moves into the desired pose and then powers the device , which currently runs for about 24 hours on a single @entity62 battery			1
" in addition to resting your leg muscles , it also provides optimal posture , " adds noonee cto and co-founder @entity64 " it keeps your back straight and can reduce the occurrence of bad postures for both healthy workers and those recovering from muscle related injuries			1
" @entity78 , a chartered physiotherapist , told @entity0 : " as physiotherapists we actively encourage people to move throughout the day			0
this device looks like a great compromise in that it allows the wearer to move as well as sit intermittently			1
i would n't encourage its use for long term sitting , however it is suitable for people who need to vary their tasks			0
" the @entity94 chair is attracting interest and production line trials are set to start in @entity97 with @entity98 in september and with @entity99 later this year			1
while sitting down all day is so detrimental to health that it will shorten life expectancy , standing up in order to work is also a source of problems			0
physical strain , repetitive movements and poor posture can lead to conditions called musculoskeletal disorders ( @entity111 ) , which are now one of the leading causes of lost workday injury and illness			2
in 2011 , @entity111 accounted for 33 percent of all worker injuries and illnesses in the @entity118 with over 378,000 cases , according to data from the @entity121			0
in @entity123 , over 40 million workers are affected by @entity111 attributable to their job , according to a study entitled @entity126 and conducted across 23 @entity123 countries			0
the @entity94 chair represents an innovative approach to this problem , which is currently addressed mostly through ergonomics of the workplace			1
although unique , it shares some similarities with the @entity134 , a monopod used by farmers to milk cows , which dates back to the early 19th century			0
it had straps that secured it to the wearer and required some practice to be used due to the single source of support			0
it was phased out by the rise of the milking parlor			0
an aluminium and carbon fibre frame keeps the overall weight of the @entity7 at just two kilograms , so it does n't burden the wearer with too much excess weight and only marginally impairs movement			0
and in the future , it could be fitted with smart motors able to infer the user 's intentions and offer the ideal posture without even the need to press a button			1
this could open up additional daily life applications , says @entity20 : " imagine if you had one of these while you were riding on a crowded train : it would make for a much more comfortable commute			0
but we 're also thinking about people behind the counter in retail , farmers picking fruit and even surgeons in the operating room			0
a chair would be impractical , but the @entity7 would fit in nicely			2

the @entity94 chair is an exoskeleton that locks into place when you sit down
it allows the user to rest their leg muscles and can improve posture , according to the @entity28 startup behind the device
@entity98 and @entity99 are set to conduct production line trials this year
