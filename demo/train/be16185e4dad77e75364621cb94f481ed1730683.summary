@entity0 -- a smartphone or tablet feature high on your holiday list this year ? how about a robot instead ? @entity7 , head of the @entity8 at the @entity9 , is launching a crowd funding campaign that will let you buy exactly that			1
what is being billed as the first family robot -- @entity14 -- is on the way			1
at $ 499 for consumers and $ 599 for developers , the price is in line with a high - end smartphone			0
but @entity14 is intended to be so much more			2
@entity7 , who has pioneered work in making robots more social and interactive , believes @entity14 can be an organizer , an education tool , even assist elderly family members			1
" @entity14 is this helpful presence that helps support your family , your human network , to be more efficient and feel more connected , " says @entity7			1
we got a chance to meet @entity14 and see a demo of what he can do			2
it is a big leap from the likes of @entity37 , which most of us are used to			0
as a mom , i loved the fact it can snap pictures -- finally i will be in some ! the reminder functions would be great for my busy family and i also think kids will engage			2
i spent time with @entity7 in her lab this week and i was amazed to see the way small children respond to robot interaction , as opposed to a learning app which they can tire of quickly			1
there is , however , much @entity53 ca n't do yet , so keep your expectations in check			0
@entity14 does not think independently			2
he is not going to be your personal butler , or dinner date			0
if you order @entity14 now you are getting a prototype , which by definition means not everything will work the way you hope			1
this rollout is intended for those who want to help refine @entity14			0
the software running the robot is an open developer platform and @entity7 and her team fully expect that community to come up with novel ideas that will help @entity53 mature			1
i , for one , hope someone can make @entity14 mobile			0
right now , he spins but ca n't follow you around the house			0
but if you 're are ready to embrace the robot revolution and invite one into your family , @entity53 says he wants to meet you too .			0

@entity14 , a personal robot , has been launched by robotics pioneer @entity7
the robot is *designed* to be an organizer , educator and assist family members
@entity1 *'s* @entity88 met him and says she was *impressed* with his *skills*
but the @entity14 up for grabs is just a prototype -- so do n't expect too much
