-- we in the media seem to be dealing with a whole lotta liars : a college football star who told the world he had met his imaginary girlfriend			0
a cycling champion who lied about doping for a decade			2
a coach who abused boys and covered it up			0
and that 's just from the wide world of sports			1
what 's clear , as these stories have unfolded , is that journalists do n't possess lie - detector machines			1
but they do have bs detectors			0
and these are apparently getting rusty			0
take the case of @entity22 , who confessed to @entity23 in an interview broadcast thursday that , well , he kinda made up the minor detail that he had met his imaginary girlfriend			1
he was " going to be put on national tv " after saying that the girlfriend had died , @entity22 told @entity23			1
" you know , what would you do ? " um , tell the truth ? opinion : @entity22 story , big fail for sportswriters we still do n't know whether the @entity37 star was in on the hoax earlier			1
but we do know he did n't want to ruin the heartwarming story line that the media utterly swallowed -- that his play was inspired by the girlfriend 's demise			1
@entity23 , by the way , did a masterful job of poking holes in @entity22 's tale while also expressing empathy for a troubled young man			1
yet the lack of journalistic skepticism on this heartwarming tale of tragedy was stunning			0
no one had seen the girlfriend			0
@entity22 said he mainly communicated with her online			1
there were no pictures of them together			0
watch : how @entity23 artfully exposed @entity22 the malfeasance was even worse after @entity62 's alleged death			1
@entity63 of @entity64 has acknowledged that he ignored a number of red flags			0
no record of what @entity22 described as an earlier car accident			1
no mention of her in @entity74			0
no record of her brother 's name so he could spellcheck it			2
but he went ahead and published anyway , as did @entity79 , @entity80 and others , to the shame of the sports journalism world			2
once there were rumblings that @entity62 might not exist , @entity80 was chasing that story but , after an internal debate , the network held off while trying to get an interview with @entity22 , according to the @entity90			1
the hope of access trumped the investigative reporting , so the hoax was exposed by the snarky but solid sports blog @entity96			1
watch : @entity97 mocks @entity99 's anger at @entity101 hearing @entity102 was another case study in deception and deceit			2
in the early years , as he won one @entity106 after another , virtually no one in the media wanted to mar the story line of the guy who overcame cancer and kept piling up championships			0
he said he never took banned substances -- was n't that good enough ? did n't sportswriters hope to get the next @entity102 interview ? obviously the story line about drug use grew in recent years as former teammates hurled allegations , and @entity121 anti-doping officials mounted an investigation that would wind up stripping @entity102 of his titles			2
finally , of course , he went to @entity126 and said he 'd been lying all along			0
even so , some of his media defenders were less than outraged			0
@entity130 sportswriter @entity129 told @entity131 that @entity102 had called her : " he said he was sorry for misleading me			0
he said he was sorry -- and this is a very small thing -- but he expressed that he was sorry that my reputation had taken a hit because of my association with him , which i appreciated			0
and it was n't a very long conversation , but it was a meaningful one to me			2
" watch : @entity140 and media redemption @entity129 said she was n't mad at @entity102 and that " that there 's a level of anger at @entity102 that is out of proportion to the offense of doping			1
" i 'm not feeling as charitable			0
i 'm angry because @entity102 lied			2
as for the @entity150 debacle , it 's hard to deny that the worship of college football blinded the media to the notion that the sainted @entity155 might do anything wrong -- such as looking the other way after allegations that his assistant , @entity159 , was sexually abusing children			1
this sickening scandal unfolded under the nose of the sports media establishment until it was exposed by a local reporter , @entity164 of the @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167			0
( @entity164 now works at @entity0			0
) we in the news business are accustomed to being misled and misinformed by politicians and their operatives			1
we 've been through too many scandals to believe otherwise			0
and while we sometimes fall down on the job , we bring to the political arena a certain battle - hardened skepticism			1
watch : beyonce lip - synced -- oh well the tradition has always been that sports is different , a kind of protected zone where athletes compete and no amount of spin can alter their performance on the field			2
hero worship was baked into the cake , especially when covering local teams			1
if that was once true , it 's hardly the case now in the era of steroids and strikes and lockouts and violence , as was sadly underscored when @entity197 of the @entity198 fatally shot his girlfriend and himself , and @entity200 was skewered for talking about the @entity202 's gun culture			0
the notion that today 's sports journalism can be anything other than aggressive and tough - minded is now as fictional as @entity22 's imaginary girlfriend			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity22 saga is the latest of a *series* of *embarrassing* failures by journalists
@entity209 says reporters covering sports ca n't fall *victim* to hero worship
*people* in news business are accustomed to being lied to , @entity209 says
@entity209 : it 's time for aggressive and tough - minded sports reporting
