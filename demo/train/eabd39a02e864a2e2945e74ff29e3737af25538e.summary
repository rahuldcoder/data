@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was around by 5 p.m. wednesday when residents first saw the monster tornado heading toward the heart of this proud @entity8 university town			1
some fled for their lives			1
the destructive force of @entity16 that day wo n't ever be forgotten by the 93,000 people who call @entity0 home			1
that day has united them , through horror and hope , tears and prayers			1
@entity24 , a manager at a @entity25 , rushed a family of three into the pharmacy 's breakroom , where they huddled with employees			1
their car had screeched to a halt at the door , the tornado just across the street			1
not too far away , @entity36 saw it from her front porch and cuddled with her 5 - year - old daughter and husband			1
her daughter sang out , " @entity42 ! @entity42 ! @entity42 ! " @entity36 chimed in with " thank you ! thank you ! thank you			1
" @entity44 buried her head in clothes in an alcove of her house a few blocks away			1
" oh @entity50 , " she said as her house trembled			1
@entity51 had a different reaction			1
" oh s --- , " he screamed			1
@entity51 was in his law office in a @entity0 neighborhood known as @entity55 or @entity56 -- a working - class residential area east of downtown that 's predominantly @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity51 would owe his life to five people who pulled him from rubble -- one of whom he said was a known drug dealer			1
in a one - block radius around @entity51 's office , he said , at least 15 people were killed			1
@entity69 had no way of knowing at the time , but @entity72 -- the house of worship where three generations of family have attended , the church where her grandfather laid the cornerstone in 1922 -- was about to get pummeled			1
just up the road , @entity79 had stood as a beacon of hope for low - income children here			1
built in recent years , the school was a state - of - art facility , complete with a computer lab , gym , library and plush rooms			1
luckily , it was empty wednesday afternoon			1
one of the few things still standing at the school is a doorway			1
above it , the sign reads , " school is cool			1
" as bad as the destruction is across @entity0 , @entity97 lies in @entity55 , where homes and anything else in the tornado 's path were demolished for blocks on end			1
" i 've never seen devastation like this , " president @entity105 said as he toured @entity55 during a visit to @entity0 on friday			1
front yard a trash can @entity44 stands outside what 's left of her home on @entity113 in @entity55			1
its walls crumbled under the force of the storm			1
her living room and a front bedroom disappeared			1
the roof of the house got sucked up , too			1
" a war zone , " she says of the mountains of broken 2 - by - 4s and other debris all around			1
see hi - res photos of the devastation she raised her three boys in that home , lived there for 30 years			1
she points across the road , three homes up , to where her truck landed in an oak tree			1
" it 's buried in a twisted part of the tree , " she says			1
her other vehicle got tossed across the yard , its windows smashed in			1
the tornado picked up a neighbor 's home and dropped it across the street			1
the woman inside was killed			1
@entity44 is glad to be alive , she says , " but i 've lost everything really			1
" she laughs , smiles and chuckles as she surveys the damage , her family all around			1
the only thing intact in her home is the deep freeze , which sits where it always has in the kitchen			1
" you have to laugh to keep from crying , i guess			1
" when the tornado hit , she simply hung on tight and kept her head buried			1
@entity157 shook , dust fell everywhere			1
" when i looked up , all i could see is sky , " she says			2
" it was still daylight			2
you see the pictures on tv of these war zones			2
that 's what i was thinking of			2
" my nerves were shaking all over my body			2
" her youngest son , @entity169 , was killed seven years ago at age 23 in a car accident			2
her husband has been hospitalized for the last six months with an array of health problems			2
" they say the @entity177 ca n't put on you more than you can take , " she says			2
" but how much more can i take ? " amid the debris , she 's found some photos of her youngest son , " but not all			2
" " i do n't know where they are , " she says			2
" under all that mess , i guess			2
" she tosses an empty french fry container on the debris heap			2
her front yard is now a trash can			2
the family has planted an @entity59 flag out front , a ray of hope that they will rebuild			2
a few houses up , amid the twisted piles of former homes , someone 's walker stands in a front yard			2
resting against it is a young woman 's wedding photo , a wide smile on her face			2
@entity205 stands outside a cousin 's home			2
he raises his hand and points up and down the road			2
" this is @entity97 , " he says			1
many people here are renters			2
" do you think most these people have insurance ? this is just ridiculous			2
" " just take a walk through , it 's a mess			2
" " but i 'm hopeful			2
there is some hope in this , " he says			2
" all i can say is @entity225			2
" ' the woman with the baby is screaming ' the @entity25 lies in the heart of @entity0 's commercial district , next to the city 's main mall and the @entity232 , just west of @entity55			1
