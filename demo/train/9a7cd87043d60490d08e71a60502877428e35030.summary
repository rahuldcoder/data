-- i was watching yet another annoying political ad produced by some super pac of which i 've never heard , and all i could think was : " sheesh , it 's not even june , and i 'm already sick of this stuff			1
with five months to go until the election , i think a steady diet of this junk will drive me into a mental institution			1
" me and about 200 million other @entity10			0
let 's face it -- the way we elect our presidents is seriously dysfunctional			1
the seemingly endless campaign season			0
the hectoring tv ads , the hundreds of millions of dollars poured into the system , the endless polling and pontificating			1
contemplating this , all i can do is repeat the immortal words of @entity23 in " @entity24 " : " @entity25 damn you all to hell ! " but there are ways to make the system better			1
if , that is , we have the will ( and this is highly questionable )			0
i 'm no pundit ; heck , i 'm not even @entity34 ( think of me as @entity35 ) , but i 'd like to offer a few suggestions on how to restore sanity to the process			0
make the presidency a six - year , one - term - only gig			1
that gives anyone elected to the job plenty of time to actually accomplish something , while also guaranteeing that the second half of his or her term wo n't be spent running for re-election			1
start the campaign season after @entity52			2
most industrialized countries run political campaigns that are three months in length or less			1
do they know something we do n't ? or should i say , have you ever heard the term " voter exhaustion ? " 3			2
@entity64 , up there with @entity65 ( separate but equal ) as one of the worst decisions in @entity69 history , only made a bad system even worse , allowing more millions to pour into an already corrupt process			2
so give each contender a fixed amount of money , and tell them they can spent it any way they want , but that 's all they 'll have -- no private , corporate or @entity82 contributions at all			2
@entity86 negative ads. believe it or not , @entity88 does this			1
they have an independent commission deciding when a political ad goes over the line into negativity and falsehood			2
if they can do it @entity98 , why ca n't we ? 5			0
it seems there 's a new poll every microsecond			2
what do they really tell us ? that people 's minds keep changing ? stop the presses on that one ! pass a law saying every news organization and polling organization can only do their thing , say , once a month			1
that 'll do for a start			0
but i can hear some of you saying " this is a free country , yadda yadda , people can spend their money any way they want , yaddayadda , there 's such a thing as free speech in a democracy , yadda yadda yadda			0
" and besides , it 's all settled law , you say ; the court has ruled on @entity64			0
well , yes i know this			0
things do n't change overnight			0
but here 's what else i know : sometimes liberty becomes license			0
and that 's what 's happening in @entity139 today			0
money has completely corrupted the system and helped create a situation where the @entity10 , the most powerful country on @entity143 , has one of the lowest voter turnouts ( lower than any country in @entity147 or @entity139 , lower than most countries in @entity149 )			1
you think disgust with the process has anything to do with this ? think about that the next time the @entity154 super pac puts another misleading , demeaning and infuriating political ad on the tube			0
how about you ? what do you think we can do to improve the election process ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			1

@entity163 says he 's sick of *unending* political ads , and we have five months to go
he says the election system is dysfunctional , but it could be helped
he says make presidency a single six - year term so that something gets done
@entity163 : @entity86 negative ads , limit polling , spending ; at least it 's a start
