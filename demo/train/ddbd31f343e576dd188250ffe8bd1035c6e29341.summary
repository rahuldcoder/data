in the areas surrounding the southwest @entity4 town of @entity5 , an idyllic coastal settlement popular with tourists , @entity0 and @entity1 have lived @entity8 peacefully for generations			1
but a wave of deadly communal violence that followed a rally sunday by hardline @entity14 nationalist monks has changed that			1
" the house i owned was burnt down			2
my family has nowhere to go , " @entity18 , a father of eight children , told @entity20 tuesday			2
his family , which has been sheltering at a local mosque since being displaced by the rioting , had n't eaten for a day and a half , he said			2
the rally , organized by the far - right @entity14 group @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , was called in response to an alleged altercation in the area between a group of young @entity0 and a @entity14 monk and his driver on an important @entity14 religious holiday days earlier			1
addressing the crowd of thousands sunday , the @entity28 's leader , @entity37 , gave an inflammatory speech			1
video footage from the event shows the orange - robed monk using derogatory terms for @entity0 and , to approving roars from the crowd , vowing that if any @entity0 laid a hand on a member of the @entity51 majority -- let alone a monk -- that would " be the end " of them			1
after the rally , @entity14 mobs marched through @entity0 neighborhoods , torching and destroying dozens of homes and shops , witnesses told @entity20			1
following consecutive nights of violence , in which local medical staff say at least four people were killed and sixteen seriously injured , those made homeless by the rioting were sheltering in the town 's main mosque tuesday , shell - shocked and fearful of what may come next			1
' a nightmare ' among them was @entity70 , an 80 - year - old grandmother of three , who was at home when the mob stormed into her house in @entity74 , a local village comprised of @entity51 and @entity0			1
" we pleaded with the attackers not to harm us			0
they used abusive language , " she said			0
" they took the @entity81 and burnt it outside ... then they looted the house			0
" her family had nowhere to go , she said			0
@entity86 , a father of four from @entity87 , was also made homeless by the riots			0
" i have lost all my belongings			0
my house was burnt down			0
all i own today are the clothes my children wear , " he said			0
" i do n't know where to go from here			0
my children are all frightened and in a state of shock			0
" the surrounding area is in lockdown in the aftermath of the rioting , the country 's worst communal violence in years			2
soldiers on armored troop carriers watch over once bustling streets ; shutters are drawn on the charred remains of arson - hit stores			0
in a nearby house , @entity110 citizen @entity109 , 47 , found herself unexpectedly stranded in her bedridden mother 's home during a visit from @entity115 for a family event			0
" every night has been a nightmare , " she told @entity20			0
" we have not slept for fear there would be attacks			0
we kept our lights switched off but remained together inside the house			0
" ' cycle of fear ' @entity126 , a doctor at a local hospital and a muslim , said his community was in a " cycle of fear " as a result of the violence , in which the vast majority of those treated for injuries were @entity0			1
he said three of the dead were @entity0 , two of whom were fatally shot during the rampage on sunday , and another who died of his injuries tuesday			1
the fourth fatality was a @entity144 who worked as a watchman on a @entity0 - owned farm in the nearby town of @entity149 , and was attacked during continued violence on monday night			1
sixteen people had been seriously injured , he said , including a young man whose leg was amputated wednesday , while hundreds of others sustained lesser injuries			0
more than 80 homes were also destroyed in the rioting , he said			0
while a heavy military presence has been brought in to enforce a curfew and prevent further violence , it has given little comfort to the community , he said			2
" the armed forces are supporting the majority , " he said , referring to the mostly @entity14 sinhalese who account for about three - quarters of @entity4 's population			1
about 10 % of the country is @entity0 , according to the 2011 census			1
" they are guarding the majority people who attack our people			0
" the group blamed for inciting the violence , the @entity28 , has denied any responsibility			1
contacted by @entity20 , @entity37 said he was unavailable to comment			0
but @entity179 , the @entity28 's chief executive , told @entity20 " we categorically deny any involvement by our membership in reported attacks			2
" he said the earlier assault on the monk on a @entity14 holy day had upset people in the @entity51			1
referring to @entity37 's speech , he said : " it is true our priest spoke in strong words			0
he blessed the people after chanting verses			0
he preached to them to conduct themselves peacefully			0
" the allegations against @entity28 , he said , were " an attempt to bring disrespect to @entity14 clergy and @entity1			1
" tacit political approval ? @entity14 radicalism has been on the rise in @entity4 , much as in @entity202 , where a monk - led @entity14 nationalist movement has been blamed for drumming up deadly mob violence against minority @entity0 groups			1
on thursday , a prominent moderate @entity14 monk who had campaigned for interfaith harmony was found bound and dumped on a road on the outskirts of @entity213 , after apparently having been abducted and assaulted , police said			1
the alleged victim , @entity215 , had previously been publicly threatened by @entity37 during an interfaith press conference held with @entity0 leaders in april , a police spokesman said			1
he was found with cuts to his body thursday and had been hospitalized			0
many in @entity4 , including president @entity222 's own political allies within government , are critical of the authorities for allowing the communal violence to occur			1
@entity226 , an opposition lawmaker for the southern @entity227 , told @entity20 that he believed the @entity28 has the tacit support of the @entity222 government , a view shared by many @entity4			1
@entity222 has publicly denied any link			0
the @entity28 has largely been able to operate with impunity , with previous attacks attributed to the organization going unpunished			2
@entity235 , @entity4 's minister of justice and the leader the country 's largest @entity0 political party , said in parliament that police had been asked to stop the rally but had failed to heed the request			1
he also blamed @entity28 for inciting the " orgy of attacks against @entity0 , " and told @entity20 he was weighing his party 's future in the government -- made up of an alliance of parties -- pending the official response to the violence			1
@entity253 , the local lawmaker for @entity235 's @entity254 , also blamed police for allowing the rally to take place , and said he had nearly been shot in the aftermath			2
" muslims and @entity51 in this area have been leading peaceful lives helping each other			0
this is the first time police have allowed such a meeting , where mobs were incited , to take place , " he told @entity20			2
" the meeting on sunday by the @entity28 roused religious sentiments			1
mobs went on the attack			2
the police looked the other way			2
" police : we took precautions but police senior superintendent @entity272 , in charge of the district where the violence took place , denied any police responsibility for the violence			1
" we took all precautions			0
the allegation that we were inactive is false			0
we had deployed police all around			2
" police said 55 arrests have been made over the violence , while probes by the criminal investigation department and @entity213 crimes division look into larger questions around criminal culpability for allowing the rally to proceed			1
a group of more than 300 concerned @entity4 , including academics , lawyers and journalists , signed an open letter condemning the @entity28 's " hate speech , " saying they believed the violence was directly linked to the inflammatory comments by @entity37			1
" we therefore call upon the authorities to take immediate steps to arrest and charge him for the deaths and destruction in the area , " read the letter			0
returning to the country after a @entity307 meeting of developing nations in @entity309 , @entity222 visited an affected @entity0 town and vowed that an " impartial inquiry would be held and those responsible punished			2
" he made no reference to the @entity28			2
many @entity0 businesses in @entity4 's capital were shut thursday in protest at the violence .			1
