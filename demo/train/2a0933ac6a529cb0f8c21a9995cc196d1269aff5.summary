-- the long - rumored @entity2 phone might finally be ready to make its debut			1
the company is expected to announce a new @entity6 smartphone running a special facebook - centric version of @entity8 on thursday , according to numerous rumors and leaks on tech sites and major publications including the @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
expanded smartphone integration is a logical step for the social media company , which has been working hard to increase its mobile presence and make more money off of mobile advertising			0
the only official hint doled out by @entity2 so far is that the announcement has something to do with @entity26 's @entity8 mobile operating system , with the invite asking press to " come see our new home on @entity8 " at its @entity32 , @entity31 headquarters			1
rumors of a @entity2 phone have been swirling for years , but ceo @entity35 has repeatedly denied the company was " building " a phone , saying @entity2 was not interested in becoming a hardware company			1
those carefully worded denials should still stand			0
if rumors prove true , @entity2 has n't built a phone , it 's just partnered with a phone manufacturer to place its service and apps more front and center on a typical @entity8 smartphone			1
that device is expected to be an @entity6 4.3 - inch smartphone called the @entity51 that bears a passing resemblance to the @entity53 , comes in multiple colors , and packs in the usual mid-range specs at moderate price			1
there does n't seem to be much that 's exceptional or new about the hardware itself beyond the @entity2 makeover			0
screens shots that purportedly show the new @entity8 homepage , possibly called @entity65 , show buttons along the top for common @entity2 actions , such as updating a status , posting a photo or checking into a location , and icons for the major @entity2 apps including @entity74 in the center of the screen			1
@entity2 might also release a similar new standalone @entity2 @entity8 app for all @entity8 phones			1
the homepage retooling would expand @entity2 's reach beyond the standalone @entity2 app , spreading its presence into more parts of the smartphone experience			2
people would end up spending larger amounts of time using the social network 's features , in turn giving @entity2 more opportunities to collect data and serve up relevant ads. smartphone users are already checking @entity2 an average of 14 times a day , according to a recent survey by @entity98			2
@entity2 was the most popular mobile app across platforms in 2012 in the @entity101 according to @entity102 , and in january more people were checking @entity2 on their mobile devices than desktop computers for the first time			2
if priced low enough , a @entity2 - centric phone could be appealing to @entity2 fans in developing countries , where the network is popular and smartphone sales are still rising sharply			1
the partnership could also be a boost for @entity114 phone manufacturer @entity6 , which has been struggling to keep up with smartphone leaders @entity116 and @entity117			0
@entity2 has been focusing intensely on mobile since going public in mid- 2012			0
in the past year it has revamped its @entity119 and @entity8 mobile apps and started displaying ads on mobile devices			0
as a result , the company has had signficant success making money on mobile			0
according to a recent report from research company @entity129 , @entity2 is currently the second largest mobile ad publisher in the @entity101 after @entity26 , and is expected to make $ 964.9 million in mobile ad revenue in 2013			2
this is the third major product announcement from @entity2 in recent months			0
the first was for @entity134 , an advanced search tool for more effectively drilling down into your @entity2 to network to find people and pages and companies			0
last month the company unveiled a redesigned news feed that looks more like its mobile apps .			0

@entity2 is making an @entity8 - related announcement on thursday
the company is expected to unveil a new @entity6 phone with *additional* @entity2 features
it could also debut a new stand - alone @entity8 app
