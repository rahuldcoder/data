@entity12 fighters exchange gunfire with government forces in @entity7 on july 3			2
the eight - week long push by @entity16 and @entity18 militias has prompted what the agency calls " the biggest exodus from the troubled @entity6 capital since the @entity24 intervention in 2007			1
" " the escalating conflict in @entity7 is having a devastating impact on the city 's population causing enormous suffering and massive displacement , " the @entity2 high commissioner for refugees said			1

" " neighborhoods affected by the fighting include @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 in @entity7			0
these areas have hitherto been islands of peace , escaping much of the conflict and destruction			0
