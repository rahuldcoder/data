-- when former @entity3 international captain @entity2 is asked why he became a professional footballer , he gives a simple reply			1
" i was born in 1970 , " he says			0
that may seem like a slightly abstract answer to those unfamiliar with @entity10 's most populous nation			0
to those from the land of sun , samba and the beautiful game , however , it makes perfect historical sense			0
that was the year of the 1970 @entity19 in @entity20 , where @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 dazzled an international audience with a style of football seldom seen since			1
there are even some who maintain this @entity3 side remains the greatest team in the history of the sport			1
" that says it all about how i got into football , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity36 series			1
" i was born during @entity19 time and from there it was just about giving sequence to what i really enjoyed and that was playing football			1
" a rampaging right - sided defender with seemingly endless stamina , @entity2 played in four @entity47 , captaining @entity3 to football 's biggest prize in 2002 and starring in two others -- @entity51 1994 , where @entity3 won and @entity52 1998 where they lost 3 - 0 to the hosts in the final			1
he also became the most capped @entity57 player of all time ( winning 148 caps ) whilst picking up 21 trophies in a glittering career at club level in @entity3 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
former @entity66 manager , sir @entity65 , even once jokingly queried if @entity2 had two hearts such was his ability to keep on running without getting tired -- even towards the end of his career			1
" nowadays , everyone says that i should have continued to play , " @entity2 said when asked on why he retired when he seemingly still had much gas left in the tank			2
" but i thought that was the moment to stop playing ... ( at ) 38 years old			0
" " i think i had already given my contribution to football , not just nationally but internationally as well , " he added			0
escape from poverty to be fair to @entity2 ( @entity2 's full name ) , it was a long journey			1
one that stretched fully 18 years in total			0
it all began in @entity84			2
@entity2 was born in the city 's impoverished @entity86 district , playing football in the streets and learning the tough lessons that would later shape his outlook on life			1
he now runs a charity foundation in his old neighborhood and hopes to encourage the young people there to dream big			0
" everything i have , i owe to @entity98 , " he said			0
" i want the children to see me there , that i 'm giving them attention , so that they can have a good role model			0
what our children are missing today are good role models			0
" the young @entity2 had trials at a host of @entity57 sides in the late 1980s before eventually being accepted by hometown club , @entity84			1
originally a right - sided midfielder , @entity2 was converted into his more familiar right back position by inspirational @entity84 coach @entity113			1
he excelled in this position and helped the @entity84 claim back to back @entity116 ( @entity10 's premier club cup competition ) crowns in 1992 and 1993			1
a transfer to @entity118 in @entity64 provided @entity2 's first foreign sojourn in the 1994 - 95 season before he returned to @entity3 one year later , first with @entity121 and then @entity122			1
after a season at @entity122 , an offer came from @entity125 to move back to @entity126			1
@entity2 would spend six seasons in the @entity129 capital where he helped the @entity130 win only their third ever serie a title and their first in 18 years			1
in 2003 , @entity2 would make the final move of his career as he was transferred to @entity136			1
here , he would win @entity137 once more as well as the @entity139 and @entity140 titles			0
with so much success , picking out a favorite club moment is no easy task			0
" in @entity84 , i won everything			2
@entity136 , i won everything			2
@entity125 , i was league champion			2
@entity122 , i was @entity147 ( @entity57 league ) champion			2
" " all the titles have been memorable			0
i do n't have one that was more memorable or less memorable			0
they are all important titles with various teams			0
" biggest prize the @entity19 is a different story , however			2
" without a doubt , winning the @entity19 as a professional athlete is the highest prize in football			1
it 's the peak , the maximum that you can reach			0
" this was a footballing zenith he reached twice			0
the first was at the @entity169 @entity168 at the final of @entity171 94 where @entity3 faced off against @entity63 in the sweltering @entity173 heat			2
@entity2 started the game on the substitute 's bench although he was required to come on for the injured @entity177 after just 21 minutes			1
" its an unexplainable feeling , " he said of having to come into the game so early and unexpectedly			0
" when ( coach , @entity24 ) @entity181 looked at the bench and said i was going to come in , there was a lot of emotion			0
" " ( the other players ) were already warmed up , everyone was at a fast pace ... and you get on the pitch in that rhythm that looks like you are slower when in comparison to your opponents			0
" he need n't have been so concerned			0
a tense , goalless encounter went to penalties with @entity3 triumphing after @entity63 's @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 missed from the spot			1
the second @entity19 triumph was even more satisfying			2
as captain , @entity2 led an unfancied @entity3 who had struggled through qualifying all the way to the final against @entity205 at the @entity206 in @entity207			1
two goals from an inspired @entity209 settled the tie in @entity3 's favor , securing a record fifth @entity19 crown for the country			1
in an iconic moment , @entity2 climbed atop the podium high above his team mates to accept the trophy			2
climbing and getting the cup up in the air the way we did ... maybe that made is what made it so beautiful , " @entity2 said recalling the moment			2
" i think that @entity3 deserved at that moment to be in the highest place of the stadium			2
" this exalted position is a place he hopes to see his younger compatriots occupy later this summer as the @entity19 comes to @entity3 for the first time since 1950 and @entity10 for the first time since 1978			1
with star players like @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 , as well as home advantage , @entity3 are rightly considered among the leading contenders			2
doubts have been raised , however , about the country 's preparation for the tournament as well as whether the economic benefits will be felt by all in @entity57 society			0
" the infrastructures are being built , the stadium is being built ( and ) the @entity57 people 's faith is helping a lot , " @entity2 said			1
" for us it is going to be a very historic and fantastic moment			0
" i have no doubt whatsoever that @entity3 will do a terrific @entity19 and they will be ( six time ) world champions , " he added			1
the likes of @entity259 , @entity205 , @entity64 , @entity260 and @entity63 will no doubt have something to say about that			0
if the hosts can channel the belief and stamina of their former captain , however , there might be little the others can do about it			0
