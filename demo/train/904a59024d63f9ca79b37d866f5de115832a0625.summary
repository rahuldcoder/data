-- inside @entity2 's refrigerator this week was a stool sample that he planned to ship to a laboratory , which will send back a report of information about what 's going on inside @entity2			1
this monthly test is not part of his doctor 's orders , nor is the plethora of mobile technologies that @entity2 uses to track what 's going on inside his body			1
but @entity2 believes everyone should take charge of monitoring their own health , given how little time people tend to spend actually talking to their doctors			1
@entity2 may be an extreme example , but many people are turning to available technologies to gain knowledge about their bodies that they can use to optimize their health , beyond what information annual doctor 's visits might bring			1
" i am trying to respect my doctor by doing my part of the homework , " said @entity2 , 63 , of @entity32 , @entity33			1
@entity2 is the director of the @entity37 , a research center at the @entity42 's @entity40 and @entity41 campuses			1
devotion to self - tracking has a name -- " @entity45 " -- which is a website established by @entity47 co-founder @entity46 and @entity48 , @entity47 contributing editor			1
@entity48 's own website , @entity51 , says more than 12,000 people worldwide are members of @entity53			0
as of thursday , there were 873 people registered for the @entity45 message boards , where people discuss the latest apps and research			1
the website has a list of hundreds of apps and tools available for tracking different aspects of your life , from mood to diet to sleep			1
the movement hosted the conference @entity45 2012 last weekend , with @entity2 as a guest speaker			1
in @entity2 's view , it 's absurd that we know the ins and outs of our cars , and invest in maintaining them , in ways that we do n't with our bodies			1
imagine if you put water into your gas tank because you did n't read the manual , he said -- that 's what some people are doing with their bodies			1
" if there are key variables that i want that the insurance wo n't pay for , i will pay for it , " he said			0
" if your car needs some preventive maintenance , you pay for it			0
" tracking with your phone and other gadgets apps and small devices are getting ever more sophisticated in helping to track vital signs			1
@entity2 , for instance , wears a @entity104 device every day to measure his caloric intake and how many steps he takes			1
at night , he wears a @entity107 , which sends a graph of the phases of his sleep cycle to his smartphone			0
an app called @entity113 uses his phone 's camera flash to measure pulse rate , and a second program called @entity118 measures the interval between heartbeats ; irregularity means you are stressed , constant means calm			0
a diet and fitness tracking app called @entity125 has helped @entity126 , 39 , lose 102 pounds since march 2011			1
she 's not as serious about tracking all aspects of her body as @entity2 , but admits that the few times when the app malfunctions because of an update , " i feel really almost debilitated , " she said			1
" i 'm very dependent on it			0
" @entity134 uses the app to schedule all meals she plans to eat for the next week , starting with sunday , but can make adjustments if plans change			0
the app suggests the calories , fat , protein and carbs to eat daily , and also helps her track the number of calories she burns as she records fitness activities			2
other apps exist to track how you feel			2
the mood app @entity151 uses an online card game to assess your happiness levels , and also offers tracking and comment features so you can see what might be behind your ups and downs over time			2
there 's a social component , too			0
the next hot area will be apps for mental and spiritual well - being , said @entity165 , managing director of @entity166 and an early venture capital investor in health tracking apps			1
up - and - coming programs will include personalized training in optimizing things like stress and meditation			0
in the future , phones may be able to get even deeper inside your head			0
there 's a portable brain scanning system developed at @entity180 that combines a low - cost @entity182 headset and a smartphone or tablet			0
imagine a toilet with a built - in urine scanner for health ; that 's also in development , @entity165 said			0
meanwhile , there are tons of apps to experiment with : @entity45 enthusiast @entity192 created a handy map of apps to help you navigate through various tools available for different purposes			2
the body as a science experiment once @entity2 got interested in tracking things like caloric intake , weight and exercise , he took it a step further , ordering his own blood tests -- many of which insurance companies do not cover -- four to eight times a year to look for markers of inflammation			1
his out - of - pocket expenses for this amount to more than $ 5,000 per year			0
he started tracking his own levels of c - reactive protein , which is correlated with inflammation			2
in 2008 , after plotting levels of this protein for two years , he saw a dramatic increase in less than a year			0
that indicated to him that there was a problem in his body that needed to be dealt with			0
since @entity2 felt fine physically , his doctors were not concerned about the results of tests he 'd undergone on his own , telling him to come back when he had symptoms			1
those symptoms started within a few weeks : " i experienced a sudden , severe pain in my left abdomen , perhaps the worse persistent pain i have ever known , " @entity2 wrote in an article in @entity235			2
doctors diagnosed acute diverticulitis and prescribed antibiotics			0
additional blood tests revealed his c - reactive protein levels were still above the normal range ; given his strict diet and exercise regimen , this was mysterious			1
being a scientist , he decided to seek out different data : from a stool sample			2
@entity248 is an antibacterial chemical in the white blood cells that emits something equivalent to tear gas when in attacking mode			0
@entity255 's lab results showed that his levels of lactoferrin were 124 times the upper limit			0
he read in medical studies that this chemical has been shown to differentiate between irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease , which includes @entity263 's disease			0
based on the results of @entity2 's previous colonoscopy , his doctor said he could n't possibly have @entity263 's disease			1
" the doctor said , ' why are you doing this ? you should not be doing this			0
if you need tests i 'll tell you , ' " @entity2 remembered			1
instead , @entity2 found a different doctor : dr. @entity273 , a specialist in gastrointestinal disorders			2
@entity273 recalls receiving an e-mail from @entity2 saying " he 'd had persistently elevated biomarkers in blood and stool that were unexplained			1
" @entity273 took @entity2 on as a patient and ordered an mri and another colonoscopy			2
putting all the data together , @entity273 determined @entity2 was likely to have early crohn 's disease			2
they decided not to treat until @entity2 became symptomatic ; when he did start having problems , doctor and patient were able to come up with a customized treatment , @entity273 said			2
@entity2 did n't stop there			1
he took data from the @entity292 and used software to create a three - dimensional simulation so that , video - game style , he can zoom in and out of the colon and look at it in detail			0
it 's unclear whether @entity273 would have made this diagnosis had @entity2 never undergone all those independent tests and drawn up corresponding charts , @entity273 said			1
but @entity273 considers @entity2 a scientist conducting an experiment on himself , and the pilot study is ongoing			1
" all innovation has to start somewhere , " @entity273 said			0
" this guy is an innovator			0
" this all goes beyond what most people would even think to do , but @entity2 said his point is to " be pointing the way to what people can do over the next five and 10 years as these things come down			1
" his experiment is n't over			2
@entity2 had his microbiome sequenced at the @entity319 -- that 's all of the microbes that live inside him -- to see what insights can be gleaned from the addition of that data to the library of himself			2
when is it too much information ? @entity2 is on the edge of a noticeable movement of people becoming more interested in their health , @entity273 said			1
on a health policy level , what @entity2 is doing is not ready for prime time , he said			2
it 's not sufficiently tested to recommend that everyone seek their own biomarker analyses without having a doctor deem it medically necessary , and the cost - benefit ratio is n't known			2
@entity343 dr. @entity342 said she agrees with that			0
she 's all for using phones and related devices to track health -- she uses @entity104 and the @entity348 app herself			0
she thinks it 's a great idea to share this information with doctors , and encourages her young patients to increase their steps by 10 % each week until they hit a certain goal			0
ordering your own medical tests online , beyond what doctors would otherwise recommend , opens up a lot of potential problems , @entity342 said : over-testing , over-diagnosis , over-utilization of resources and false positives , meaning the results may suggest you have a disease that you do n't			1
in @entity342 's opinion , extreme tracking and testing is not a good idea , " but it can be difficult for people to know where to draw the line , " she said in an e-mail			1
still , all science begins with a novel idea that is tested on a small scale , which is what @entity2 is doing , @entity273 said			0
also , to some extent , @entity2 is making discoveries			0
his efforts have led to the diagnosis of a chronic , incurable disease in his body , but @entity2 is still optimistic			0
" i feel much more like i 'm in control because i 'm measuring it , i 'm monitoring it , i 'm understanding my bacteria -- how it 's been screwed up by antibiotics and other things , " he said			0
" i 'm quite hopeful that over the next five , 10 , 20 years , we 're going to see cures for a lot of things that we currently think of as incurable			0

many mobile apps are available to track eating , fitness , mood
some people order medical tests to track biomarkers
scientist @entity2 is using himself as an experiment in self - tracking
extreme analyzing of blood , stool is n't recommended for everyone
