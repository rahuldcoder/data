but experts say it was soon clear that the younger @entity16 would not be emulating the style of his father			2
" @entity9 was rather low profile for a few years after the death of @entity16 which is in accordance with even older confucian practices , " says @entity45 assistant professor at @entity46 in @entity0 , @entity1			2
" this is after all a dynastic system , but @entity3 quickly proved by the spring that he was going to be quite public , quite active			2

" he actually performed quite well by the standard set for him , " says @entity45			0
" he spoke in public which is something his father did not and he projected a kind of confidence and energy , he really turned the young and experienced to his advantage			0

" so that will basically placate the military so this will give him extra room to maneuver in terms of making modernization efforts if that 's his plan			0
" @entity3 's use of the media has been a drastic departure from his father 's time			1
live broadcasts and televised public speeches are no longer so unusual			0
