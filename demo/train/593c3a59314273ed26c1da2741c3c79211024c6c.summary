the fate of @entity4 's @entity3 - backed opposition hangs on a knife edge in the northern part of the war - torn country -- and with radical @entity10 militants and regime forces closing in on them from all sides , time may be running out			1
at least six villages north of @entity4 's largest city of @entity15 fell wednesday to militants from @entity16 , according to @entity17			1
the jihadist group has seized large swathes of land in @entity21 and consolidated control over considerable territory in northeastern @entity4 in the past year			0
@entity16 fighters are now just 30 miles from the rebel - controlled northern suburbs of @entity15 and within striking distance of key opposition positions leading to the @entity30 border			1
the situation for the opposition may be even worse inside @entity15 city , where forces loyal to president @entity35 are gaining ground after a brutal months - long campaign against opposition forces			1
with the radical @entity10 fighters bearing down on them from the north , and troops loyal to president @entity35 retaking @entity15 neighborhood by neighborhood from the south and west , @entity4 's beleaguered rebels are facing an existential threat			1
since november 2013 , the @entity4 government has executed a concerted offensive on opposition - controlled areas of @entity53			2
intensive and horrifically destructive barrel bombs have flattened the urban environment in which opposition insurgents had thrived , and forced thousands of civilians to flee			0
the military has followed air bombardment with methodical but effective ground incursions that , over time , have enabled it to re-capture territory and force a rebel retreat to the city 's northern districts			0
as such , the opposition is now in its weakest position in @entity53 since mid- 2012			0
@entity16 burst onto the scene in @entity4 in april 2013 and by december it had successfully established an expansive territorial presence across northern @entity4 , including in @entity70			2
but a sustained rebel offensive in january of this year forced @entity16 to withdraw from the northwestern governorates of @entity73 and @entity74 and much of @entity15 , with the exception of three main towns in @entity15 's northeast : @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
the rebels in @entity15 fighting to topple @entity35 and beat back @entity16 ' advance have long been a melting pot of different groups , including various @entity86 ( @entity86 ) units , the @entity88 affiliate @entity87 , and the @entity89 ( if )			1
while core moderate @entity86 - linked factions benefitted from an influx of @entity3 support in late 2013 to facilitate their anti-isis offensive in january , this support has since dwindled			0
a principal @entity15 - based beneficiary of this support , @entity97 , has since become a shadow of its former self			0
the @entity101 has leaned heavily on @entity102 to reduce their support of @entity106 and @entity107 groups in @entity4 , which has damaged the if 's capacity to operate as a unified and effective coalition			2
in @entity15 specifically , if 's main group , @entity110 , has also suffered from debilitating internal divisions and defections			2
at the same time , the @entity35 regime 's advances in @entity15 city and elsewhere have induced @entity87 -- a long - time ally of @entity4 's opposition , until recently -- to shift much of its resources west into @entity119			1
as such , the principal defenders of areas of @entity15 still under opposition control today are a wide array of moderate @entity86 factions , some of whom still receive limited military support from the @entity130 , and members of the fading if , most of whom are from the @entity15 area			0
these groups have borne the brunt of fighting @entity16 while also facing a sustained @entity4 military assault			1
both of these offensives have combined to leave @entity15 critically vulnerable			0
but although regime advances in @entity15 city are extremely significant , the most immediate threat comes from @entity16 and its rapid advance north of the city			1
controlling @entity142 , one of the villages that @entity17 reported was seized wednesday , is already extremely symbolic for @entity16 , whose official magazine is named after the town for its role in the hadith -- the teachings , deeds , and sayings of the @entity153 -- as the site of a major battle before the @entity156			0
@entity157 , who founded @entity16 ' precursor group , once said the capture of @entity142 would represent the first step towards conquering " @entity161 " and " @entity162			0
" with those villages in hand , @entity16 now seems likely to move forward on two primary fronts -- northwest towards @entity166 and eventually @entity167 and southwest to @entity110 's stronghold in @entity169			2
if @entity16 moves on @entity166 and then captured @entity167 , it will cut rebels off from a critical supply line into @entity30 via @entity172 and could arguably spell the end for an effective opposition in @entity15			1
losing @entity169 to @entity16 would prove a crippling blow for @entity110 , whose founder and former leader @entity178 was from the town			0
it would likely enable @entity16 to continue towards @entity180 and @entity181 , immediately north of opposition - controlled districts of @entity53 , and cut off any remaining rebel forces there			2
eventually , this would also open a route towards the former @entity16 towns of @entity187 and @entity188 to the west in @entity119 , where @entity16 could threaten what would then be the last remaining border crossing with @entity30 at @entity192			0
late on wednesday , while mosques in @entity169 issued calls for a general mobilization to defend against the expected @entity16 assault , civilians and rebels stockpiled food and supplies in the case of a siege , according to people i spoke to in the town			0
what will isis do if , as now seems inevitable , it captures these towns ? the group has named their @entity15 offensive " @entity216 for the women 's purity , " a reference to allegations made by @entity16 fighters that opposition groups had kidnapped and raped their wives during the @entity215 push in january			1
such accusations would therefore seem likely to engender brutal acts of @entity16 retribution in the coming days			0
there 's no escaping the fact that the opposition 's prospects in @entity15 look grim			2
while a 9 - month - old @entity101 - led strategy of uniting and arming core elements of the moderate opposition has demonstrated success in @entity74 , it is far from certain that @entity15 can be saved			0
moreover , if @entity16 was eventually to succeed in threatening , or worse cutting off , both the @entity172 and @entity192 crossings with @entity30 , the sustainability of a powerful moderate opposition in northern @entity4 would face an existential threat			1
the fate of @entity15 in the coming days , therefore , carries with it the future of @entity4 's military opposition in its fight against the @entity35 regime and an ever - expanding @entity16 .			1

@entity16 fighters reportedly seize villages just 30 miles from @entity15 , @entity4 's largest city
rebels fighting to topple @entity35 surrounded by @entity16 on one side , and regime forces on the other
