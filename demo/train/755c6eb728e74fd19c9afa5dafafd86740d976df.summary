@entity0 -- when ceo - turned - whistleblower @entity3 exposed a $ 1.7 billion cover - up of losses at @entity7 , he was forced to flee from @entity8 , fearing for his life , as the scandal sent shockwaves through the country 's tight - knit corporate world			1
the 52 - year - old @entity14 had barely settled in to his new role as the company 's first foreign chief executive when he became aware of a potentially explosive magazine article			1
@entity19 , a local @entity8 title with only nine staff , had published a detailed expose in july 2011 questioning exorbitant fees it claimed the camera and medical equipment maker had paid consultants for a 2008 acquisition deal			1
it also questioned extravagant purchase prices of three small companies			0
" the company had bought three ' @entity37 companies ' for a billion dollars : a plastic plates company for microwaves , a cosmetics company -- a face cream company -- and a recycling company , but with no turnover , " @entity3 told @entity1 tuesday , as his new book about the saga , " exposure , " prepared to hit bookshelves			2
" they then paid $ 700 million dollars in fees to somebody , we did n't know who , in the @entity48			0
i begged and begged and pleaded ' do n't treat me as a gaijin ( foreigner ) , treat me as a colleague who cares about this company			0
' but they did n't listen , not one of the 14 ( board members ) , including three non-executive directors			0
" instead @entity3 quickly found himself out of a job after he attempted to get some answers from then - chairman @entity59 and former executive vice president @entity60			2
the board voted unanimously to fire him from the post			0
@entity63 , publisher of @entity19 , gave his own blunt assessment of why @entity7 had selected what he called a " bottom - ranking foreign executive " from 25 candidates to be ceo in the first place			1
" mr. @entity59 's aim was to keep the fraud in secret under the foreign president because mr. @entity3 could not speak and read @entity8 , " he told @entity1 last year			1
@entity3 refused to go quietly , choosing instead to unleash a firestorm of publicity that would prove costly to the board and company itself			2
@entity59 and several other board members were eventually forced to resign , while @entity7 shares lost around 80 % of their market value in the first weeks after news of the scandal broke			1
a special audit of @entity7 in december last year , led by a former @entity8 @entity83 judge , published a report that blasted @entity59 's controlling style and the company culture that allowed losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for its acquisitions			1
" the management was rotten to the core , and infected those around it , " the report said			0
the case also raised questions about the level of transparency in @entity102 when to comes to business practice generally			0
in september this year , @entity59 , @entity60 and another senior executive , @entity104 , admitted filing false reports and inflating the company 's net worth			0
the men could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 10 million yen ( $ 128,400 ) , @entity8 media reports have said			2
" it was an incredible story , " said @entity3			2
" it illustrated the dysfunctionality of corporate @entity8 and the way the capital markets work			1
" a month after i was dismissed , the share price of @entity7 had fallen by 81.5 % -- $ 7 billion dollars had been struck off the value of the company , yet the institutional shareholders in @entity8 would not offer one word of criticism of the incumbent board , or one word for the ex-president in support of him trying to expose this fraud			1
" but almost a year after he was forced out of the company he had served since the 1980s , @entity3 says no lessons have been learned from the scandal by corporate @entity8			1
" nothing has changed , " he said			0
" the ruling party , the @entity132 , at the height of this said they were going to put forward a recommendation that one non-executive director should be a minimum requirement under @entity8 company law			2
" in july of this year , the @entity139 dropped that proposal , so out of the 1,600 companies on the @entity142 , over 1,000 do n't have one outside director			0
what are they scared of ? what does that tell investors who are looking at @entity8 ? " @entity3 compared the success of @entity151 electronics giant @entity150 to that of ailing @entity8 rivals such as @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 -- all have their debts set at junk status			1
" @entity8 is losing it , " said @entity3			1
" the companies and country ca n't change			0
they just ca n't change themselves			0
