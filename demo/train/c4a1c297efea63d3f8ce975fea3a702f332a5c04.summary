-- @entity1 gave an impassioned speech before the @entity3			1
president @entity1 traveled overseas -- in the middle of debates over health care and @entity7 -- to make his personal pitch to bring the @entity10 to his hometown			1
president @entity1 personally appealed to @entity3 members for the 2016 summer @entity13 to be in @entity14			1
but despite their efforts , the @entity15 will come home empty - handed as @entity14 's dreams of hosting the @entity13 evaporated in the first round			1
the news stunned those awaiting the announcement , many of whom thought the battle was between @entity14 , @entity24 , and @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity25 also beat out @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 , @entity30 , to host the games			2
although the @entity33 says the trip was the right thing to do , some @entity32 say it will have some consequences for the president			1
" other than people who like to cheer , ' we 're no. 4 ! we 're no. 4 ! ' i do n't know how this is anything but really embarrassing , " @entity32 strategist @entity40 said , adding that @entity1 's failed pitch will probably be the joke on @entity43 for weeks to come			1
" given the last two months starting with the august recess and all of the issues that surrounded that , i think that the @entity33 staff , the senior staff needs to get together somewhere and figure out how they are going to fix this , because they are in a deep slump , " he said			0
upon returning to the @entity33 on friday , @entity1 expressed no regret about his trip , saying it is " always a worthwhile endeavor to promote and boost the @entity57			1
" " one of the things that i think is most valuable about sports is that you can play a great game and still not win , " the president said			0
" although i wish that we had come back with better news from @entity66 , i could not be prouder of my hometown of @entity14			1
" @entity33 senior adviser @entity68 said that although the results were " disappointing , " @entity1 did the best he could			2
" the president made , i think , a very strong appeal , and it did n't work out			0
but it was well worth the effort			0
any time this president has a chance to go and promote the interests of this country and promote the interests of a city or a state within this country on something of this magnitude , he 's going to take that opportunity , " he said			0
@entity68 said @entity1 's appeal was n't strong enough to overcome the " internal currents , " pointing out that former @entity3 president @entity89 was among those leading the bid to bring the games to @entity27			2
" i think there were other things that played there that we simply could n't overcome , and that 's life			0
life goes on , " he said			0
@entity57 rep. @entity99 , a @entity14 @entity100 , said the loss is " kind of heartbreaking			2
... a tremendous amount of effort has been put into trying to win the bid			0
" it was n't a mistake for @entity1 to make the trip , @entity99 said			1
" i think the president did what we would expect him to do , and that is show leadership , " he said			0
@entity1 spent just four hours in @entity66 and flew back before the announcement was made			2
the president also met with his commander in @entity7 , gen. @entity116 , aboard @entity117 , following up on a wednesday meeting with his national security team on how to proceed on the war , the @entity33 said			0
before his trip , critics questioned whether @entity1 should leave the country to make his pitch , given his already full plate			1
" listen , i think it 's a great idea to promote @entity14 , but he 's the president of the @entity57 , not the mayor of @entity14 , " @entity33 minority leader @entity126 said , @entity127 reported			2
" and the problems we have here at home affect all @entity57 , and that 's where his attention ought to be			0
" last month , when the @entity15 hosted an event on the @entity33 lawn to rally support for @entity14 's bid , @entity1 was against making the trip			1
" i would make the case in @entity66 personally , if i were n't so firmly committed to making -- making real the promise of quality , affordable health care for every @entity57 , " the president said			0
but the administration had little choice but to raise the stakes , @entity33 officials said , given that the other competitors all were sending their heads of state to @entity66			0
@entity0 senior political correspondent @entity152 said @entity1 's failure to bring the @entity13 to @entity14 wo n't cause any enduring political damage			1
" it opens him to criticism and it makes it difficult for him for a while			0
but will it mean @entity161 is n't going to send more troops to @entity7 because he did n't get the @entity13 ? no. does it mean that any @entity32 or @entity100 will change their mind on health care ? no. " he 's going to be in a lot bigger trouble if he does n't deliver on health care , believe me , " she said .			2

@entity174 : " i could not be prouder of my hometown of @entity14 , " @entity1 says
" i do n't know how this is anything but really embarrassing , " @entity32 strategist says
