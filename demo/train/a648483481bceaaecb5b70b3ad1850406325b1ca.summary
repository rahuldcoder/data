-- at his son 's 11th birthday party , just before everyone was about to sing " @entity6 " and cut the cake , 46 - year - old dr. @entity1 stepped on to the porch of his @entity9 home to take a call from another doctor about a particularly sick patient			1
while on the phone , @entity1 reached up absent - mindedly and touched his neck			2
he felt a lump on the right side			0
then he felt a lump on the other side			0
feeling a bit panicky , he unbuttoned his pants and felt for lumps in his groin			0
they were there , easy to feel			0
in just seconds , his " doctor 's mind , " as he calls it , added it all up			1
the fatigue he 'd been feeling recently , the weakness , the lumps all meant one thing : cancer			0
when he went to the doctor , he found out it was peripheral t - cell lymphoma , one of the rarest and most aggressive blood cancers there is			1
twenty - four rounds of chemotherapy with 18 different drugs could n't stop its spread			2
a transplant with @entity1 ' own bone marrow did nothing			1
he needed a transplant with someone else 's marrow or he would die			1
as chairman of the department of transplantation at @entity52 in @entity9 , @entity1 had helped countless patients find donors			1
now it was his turn			0
@entity1 ' search failed , and there 's one major reason for that : he 's @entity61			2
the search for the perfect donor if you 're looking for a kidney , finding the perfect match is n't absolutely crucial -- there 's considerable wiggle room			1
but with blood cancers , there 's little wiggle room			2
you need a perfect -- or nearly perfect -- bone marrow match , and you 're much more likely to find that with someone of your own ethnicity			1
@entity76 have only a 33 % chance of finding a perfect match on @entity79 , the national bone marrow donor registry , according to dr. @entity81 , the medical director for transplant medical services for the registry			1
partly that 's because relatively few hispanics sign up to donate : they represent 10 % of people on the registry , yet 16 % of the @entity89 population			1
language barriers explain the low rate to some extent , and so does the fact that @entity76 who are in the @entity89 illegally are often reluctant to sign up , even though the registry does n't share their information with the government			1
the other reason for the difficulty is that @entity76 often have a varied genetic background that can include @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity103 roots			1
" i 'm @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
that 's why it 's so hard to match me , " @entity1 says			1
" and a lot of @entity76 are like me , with a weird combination of genes			1
" through a long series of medical interventions , few of which his doctors thought would work , @entity1 lived , and today he 's devoted himself to helping other @entity76 looking for donors			1
@entity1 ' story : a 10 % chance at life after discovering the lumps that february night in 2009 , @entity1 ended his phone call and went inside his house			1
he tried not to look panicked as he sang " @entity6 " to his son , also named @entity1			0
after the party guests left and @entity1 and his two sisters had gone to bed , @entity1 closed their bedroom door and told his wife , @entity129 , what he 'd found , and that he knew it was bad news			0
the next year was filled with the aggressive chemotherapy and the transplant with his own bone marrow , both of which failed			1
an international search for a marrow donor yielded no perfect matches and one nearly perfect match -- nine out of 10 antigens matched -- but that donor backed out			1
" my doctors gave me a 10 % chance of living , " @entity1 said			1
" then i thought about my brother , @entity147 , who was an eight out of 10 match			2
but a transplant with a match like that can kill you faster than the actual cancer			2
" @entity1 was out of options			0
" i made my plea to my doctors to use @entity147 's marrow , " he remembers			1
" i said , ' i know my chances			0
' " his doctors agreed			0
in june 2010 , they destroyed @entity1 ' immune system so it would accept his brother 's cells and then they gave him @entity147 's marrow			1
throughout that summer , @entity1 and his family waited to see if @entity147 's cells would work in his body			2
" please do n't leave me , " @entity129 would say to him every night			0
" i 'm not planning on leaving you , " he would reply			0
" i 'm going to fight and @entity168 is going to help me			0
" @entity1 did develop graft - versus - host disease , the dreaded consequences of a poorly matched transplant			2
@entity147 's cells attacked his cells			2
already too slim , he lost 30 pounds			0
tumors grew in places where they had n't been before			0
then , just when it looked like he was at a low point , @entity1 started to get better			0
today , he 's back full time at his job at @entity52			2
a second chance @entity1 attributes his recovery to excellent medical care at @entity182 , the @entity183 and the @entity184 of @entity185 , but he also credits his faith			2
" i thank @entity168 all the time for this second chance , " he says			2
@entity1 first trained as a priest in his native @entity188 before he made the difficult decision to leave the seminary and go to medical school			0
" i studied theology , but my call really was to serve others through the gift of medicine , " he says			0
" i was born to be a doctor			2
" now he takes time to help other @entity76 find bone marrow donors , including @entity199 , a teenager who lives not far from @entity200 in @entity201 , @entity202 @entity199 's story like @entity1 , @entity199 , 16 , has a mixed background -- his father is @entity206 and his mother is of @entity209 descent -- and like @entity1 , his road has been long			1
found to have leukemia in march 2006 , @entity199 was treated and went into remission			0
in may , his family and friends gathered at a local @entity206 restaurant to celebrate five years of survival			0
" five years is such a huge milestone , and we felt like the world had been lifted off our shoulders , " says his mother , @entity217			0
but then a few days later , they got a call from the teen 's doctors			1
they 'd found something suspicious in his last blood test , and @entity199 needed to come back in for a spinal tap and a bone marrow biopsy			1
those tests revealed the leukemia had returned			0
" it was just devastating , and that 's not even a strong enough word , " @entity199 says			2
@entity199 immediately joined a clinical trial with an experimental chemotherapy drug , and the search for a bone marrow donor began in earnest			1
they found one perfect match through the registry , but that donor , for reasons the @entity246 do n't know , did n't work out			1
now they have no choice but to proceed with a transplant from either his parents or his two sisters , who , like @entity1 ' brother , are far from perfect matches			2
when @entity1 heard about @entity199 through an e-mail that had been forwarded several times over , he went to a recent bone marrow drive for him			1
he could n't donate to @entity199 himself since he 's had lymphoma , but he brought with him test results from his wife , three children , four brothers and three half - sisters in hopes that they might be matches for @entity264			1
" it 's extremely heartwarming -- it 's just amazing , " @entity199 says			0
" it just kind of leaves you in awe that people who do n't even know your son would step forward and help			0
" at the drive , @entity1 spoke with @entity199			0
" i told him , i understand how you 're feeling , how it is to wait and not have a donor , " @entity1 remembers			0
" i told him there 's light at the end of the tunnel , and i 'm here to do all i can for you			0
" it turned out none of @entity1 ' relatives was a match for @entity199			0
now both , doctor and patient , or actually patient and patient , wait to see if anyone can save @entity264			0
