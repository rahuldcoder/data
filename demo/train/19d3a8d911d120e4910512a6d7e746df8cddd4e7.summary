disrupted @entity2 and @entity3 networks frustrated gamers much of friday , one day after going down on one of the busiest gaming days of the year			1
neither @entity6 or @entity7 , which own @entity2 and @entity3 , respectively , have had much to say about the outages that have kept millions of its gamers from playing one another online , but there were signs friday evening that it may soon be resolved			1
at 2:16 a.m friday , @entity7 's verified @ @entity16 account tweeted " some @entity3 users may currently be experiencing issues signing into @entity21 , " and directed users to its service website for the latest			1
@entity6 's official @entity2 support @entity26 account posted at 2:30 a.m. et , " our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today			1
thanks for your continued patience			0
" more than 14 hours later , at 5:10 p.m , it tweeted pretty much the same thing			0
" update : we are working to restore full network services for all platforms -- thanks , as always , for your patience ! but based on the overall sentiment expressed in the comments posted to message boards and on @entity26 , the collective patience among @entity2 users is offline as well			2
" @ @entity43 has been tweeting that for hours now since last night , " user christopha710 posted on @entity6 's @entity2 support forum			1
" i 'm getting rid of this piece of trash and going back too [ sic ] pc gaming " " totally not cool , " allenjaelee said late friday morning			2
" i 've tried so many times and am unable to play			0
" @entity6 hacked again ? some users talked of a possible hack			1
" this is so frustrating , " wrote calin75			0
" the hackers think they 're hurting @entity6 , but the ones that really pay for this bull crap are the innocent users			2
" if it turns out that this was indeed a cyberattack , chances are it was done by @entity64 , a band of black - hat hackers who have claimed responsibility			1
@entity68 can not confirm the identity or claims of the group , and @entity2 has n't said anything beyond that it was working to fix the problem			0
for its part , @entity3 spokesman @entity74 told @entity68 that " we do n't share info on the root cause of specific issues			1
" but there is little reason to doubt their claims			0
in august , @entity64 said it took down the @entity86 by flooding it with illegitimate traffic , something called a distributed denial - of - service attack ( @entity91 ) in the video game world , resulting in millions of gamers being unable to play together online			1
as @entity95 reported at the time , when @entity96 , president of @entity97 , tweeted about those " large scale " attacks , he became a target himself -- even at 30,000 feet			0
" we have been receiving reports that @ j_smedley 's plane @entity105 from @entity106 to @entity107 has explosives on - board , please look into this , " the group tweeted to @entity102 , resulting in the flight being diverted			2
earlier this month , @entity6 was hit with a similar outage that @entity64 not only took credit for , but it promised additional " @entity114 presents " would soon be coming			1
" unlike @entity115 , we do n't like giving all of our @entity114 presents out on one day			0
this entire month will be entertaining , " @entity116 tweeted			0
at 6:13 p.m. friday , a @entity64 twitter handle tweeted , " all attacks on @entity119			1
" when a @entity68 reporter hit refresh moments later on the @entity124 website -- which had been down since thursday evening -- it was back online			0
@entity7 's service page was still reporting ' limited service , ' however			0
stupid coincidence ? the network downtime started just hours after @entity7 's @entity3 video store started to stream the @entity131 comedy " @entity132			1
" the movie was made by @entity134 , a sibling of @entity6 's @entity137 division			1
@entity6 was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late november that was widely believed to be motivated , at least in part , by @entity142 's anger over " @entity132 , " which depicts the assassination of the country 's leader @entity144			2
but there was no indication that thursday 's problems were in any way connected to the movie 's digital release			0
other participating distributors of the movie , such as @entity154 , were unaffected			0
and @entity137 is not participating in the release			2
a @entity134 spokesman deferred to @entity2 for comment about the outage .			0

@entity137 , @entity3 had ' network issues ' well into friday
@entity162 ' has claimed responsibility
@entity64 has a history of going after @entity6
in august , it may have managed to divert a flight carrying @entity6 exec
