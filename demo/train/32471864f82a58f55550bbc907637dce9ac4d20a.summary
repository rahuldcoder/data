-- @entity2 's @entity1 set the pace in friday practice ahead of his home @entity7 @entity6 , on a day which saw heavy rain batter the @entity11 track and left organizers with a big headache			1
@entity1 's lap on one minute 56.345 seconds in the afternoon session was 0.129 seconds faster than that of @entity18 's @entity17 , after @entity19 of @entity20 went fastest in the morning			1
" i had some fun out there today , " the 27 - year - old said in a @entity2 statement			1
" i got to do a good few laps too , which was good , because i was concerned that the fans would n't get to see much action			2
" there were so many of them out there today			0
i ca n't remember seeing so many people at a racetrack on a friday before -- it was incredible			0
@entity7 @entity35 fans are the best in the world			1
" i would like to have gone out and done even more laps -- but we simply did n't have enough tires to do that			0
perhaps that 's something we can look at for the future			2
" but those fans were told to stay away from the famous circuit saturday if they had been planning to use public car parks			1
the downpours have left these areas flooded and @entity11 managing director @entity48 gave this warning			1
" tomorrow there will be 20,000 to 30,000 people we wo n't be able to properly cater for			0
" it 's going to cost us a lot of money			2
" i unreservedly apologize to people			0
i feel very responsible for it , this is something i 've been very proud of over the years and i almost could cry now			0
" tires take center stage in @entity35 over 40 millimeters of rain has fallen in 12 hours and made conditions treacherous for the drivers , with @entity63 smashing into the wall after losing control of his @entity66 midway through the second session			1
two - time world champion and current title leader @entity69 also lost his front wing after clipping the barriers			1
" unfortunately we did n't have a very productive day in the end , " the 28 - year - old @entity63 said in a @entity66 press release			1
" the weather was poor weather with puddles on the track during second practice			2
on my second run , i aquaplaned on some deep water at the high speed @entity82 section of the track and from that point i was a passenger until the car hit the wall			1
" it was quite a heavy accident but i am ok			0
there is a lot of damage to the car but the @entity66 team will , i 'm sure , do a great job of getting it back into shape for tomorrow ( saturday )			1
" @entity96 's reigning world champion @entity95 , currently fourth in the 2012 standings , bemoaned the wet conditions			0
regulations limiting the number of wet and intermediate tires teams can use combined with the weather meant most of the action was restricted to the second half of the afternoon session			0
" if there 's too much standing water on track we ca n't go out , as we aquaplane pretty quickly , " @entity95 , who finished second in last year 's race , told the sport 's official website			0
" i think @entity63 went off and it shows how quickly it can happen			2
it 's a real shame for the fans sitting in the grandstands waiting for the cars to come out			2
" we got in a bit of running in the end , but for us it 's not so useful , as you ca n't really try anything in these conditions			0
i think weather will be the most important factor in determining the rest of the weekend			0
" the teams will return to the track for practice and final qualifying saturday ahead of sunday 's ninth grand prix of the year .			1
