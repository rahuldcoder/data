-- the spacewalk tuesday was meant to replace a video camera and update cable connections to a module of the @entity5			1
however , the question every space buff wanted an answer to is : " what was that i just saw floating away ? " two objects drifted away during astronauts @entity12 and @entity15 's six - hour assignment			1
when the first one swam by , even @entity16 was befuddled as to what it was			0
" meanwhile here on the ground in @entity26 , flight controllers have been taking a look at the object seen floating away earlier in the spacewalk around 12:44 a.m. central time , " said the voice on the live @entity16 feed of the spacewalk			1
" still working to identify exactly what that object was , but they were able to determine that it does seem to have floated below the space station and it should not pose any sort of a problem for the space station as far as posing a debris threat			0
" later , @entity16 spokesman @entity41 said the object may have been a clamp used to attach cables , and it might have been left outside during a previous spacewalk			1
an hour or so after the first fly - by , a small round object made its way into the darkness of space			1
" @entity52 here moving the cameras to follow another object that seems to have floated away , " the @entity16 voice said this time			2
" a small round object that you can see in the middle of the screen here ... possibly a washer or something similar			2
" @entity61 said officials will do a photographic analysis to figure out what it was			0
but , he said , " it 's not unusual at all to have one or two objects float away during the course of a six - and - a - half hour procedure outside an orbiting space station			2
" the astronauts replaced a video camera that will monitor the docking of future @entity74 , or supply ships			0
they will then attach cables connecting the rest of the station to the @entity81 @entity80 research module			0
