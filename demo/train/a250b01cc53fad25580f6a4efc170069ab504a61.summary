they want all of us to cringe -- and they have succeeded			0
the @entity4 radicals suddenly barreling across @entity5 want to make sure people are horrified at their deeds			2
leaders of the organization that calls itself @entity10 , the @entity10 and @entity11 , have launched a sophisticated propaganda campaign that turns the most basic principles of public relations on their head			1
no pr executive would advise a client to shout to the world details of his most gruesome acts and the extent of his cruelty , but that is precisely what @entity10 is doing , and doing so very deliberately			2
the images of mass executions , of men digging their own graves before being shot in the back of the head , are splashed on the world 's newspapers , television news and social media			0
and that 's exactly what @entity10 wants			2
it is an important strategic tool that 's already paying off in the battlefield			0
but it also points to a weakness that brings into question the long - term viability of @entity10 's territorial gains			1
there is no way to fully verify that the photographs and videos are real , but there is reason to believe they are			0
after @entity10 bragged about committing a massacre , claiming it executed 1,700 @entity5 security personnel , the @entity50 's human right chief said the militants have conducted an " apparently systematic series of cold - blooded executions ( which ) almost certainly amount to war crimes			1
" multiple sources confirm that @entity10 executed hundreds of @entity5 , including many who had surrendered			1
when @entity10 posted chilling images of mass executions on a @entity62 website , an @entity5 military spokesman , lt. gen. @entity64 , reportedly verified their authenticity			1
by advertising its brutality , @entity10 is frightening at least some of its enemies into surrender			2
the tactic has proved effective , but recent history shows the plan sows the seeds of its own defeat , ultimately creating more enemies and closing off any possibility that the population will embrace the group 's rule			1
combining a campaign strategy with battlefield advances is easy to see			0
a few weeks before @entity10 launched its lightning attack on @entity83 , @entity5 's second largest city , it had already softened the ground with their gasp - inducing campaign			1
the objective was clear and the results were a rout , a disaster for the @entity5 government			2
a professionally - produced video , " @entity95 " -- the fourth in a series -- opened with a map of the target region , including @entity11 , @entity5 , @entity98 , the @entity100 territories and @entity101			2
then it went on to show @entity10 gunmen executing @entity5 soldiers			1
@entity5 @entity108 men with shovels digging their own graves , drivers at @entity10 roadblocks pulled out of their cars and shot			1
when @entity10 launched its offensive , demoralized and frightened @entity5 soldiers terrified of @entity10 and feeling little loyalty to the government in @entity115 , shed their uniforms and fled			1
the media campaign helped capture @entity83 , but the group was just getting started			2
one grisly tweet showed the head of a decapitated @entity5 officer and read , " this is our ball			0
it is made of skin			0
" it was another warning in the advance towards @entity115			0
@entity10 wants to establish a caliphate , an @entity4 state governed by its extreme interpretation of islamic law			0
the group has already conquered parts of @entity11 and is ruling there by its version of @entity135 , but its territorial objectives are larger			0
the shocking images are also meant to trigger an explosion of sectarian hatred between @entity140 and @entity108 so that @entity10 can emerge from the fighting with an expanded @entity143 state			0
the tactic , which @entity10 has used in @entity11 and its predecessors used in @entity5 , shows how difficult this battle will be for those aiming to stop the @entity4 ' advance			1
@entity10 will observe no limits in killing civilians and terrorizing the population			0
but experience shows that @entity10 extremism provokes popular revulsion , which engenders a blowback against the group			2
the organization had it start in @entity5 , when its videotaped beheadings of hostages and its bombings of civilians in the streets proved too much even for @entity162			1
named " @entity10 " then , under @entity164 's @entity163 , @entity10 was so brutal that @entity162 chief @entity165 sent @entity163 a remarkable letter urging him to ease up			1
" the @entity168 populace ... will never find palatable the scenes of slaughtering the hostages			0
" could he stop with the ( justified ) decapitations of @entity108 , he asked			0
" is it something that can be put off until the force of the @entity177 movement in @entity5 gets stronger ? " resentment against @entity10 's viciousness spawned extremism among @entity108 militias and stoked an @entity5 civil war			1
the @entity140 side was dominated by @entity10 , and the @entity108 formed death squads of their own			0
by late 2006 , @entity140 tribal leaders fed up with the killings started the @entity187 , which ultimately partnered with the @entity188 and largely defeated @entity10			0
@entity10 , renamed the @entity10 and later the @entity10 ( or the @entity10 -- @entity10 ) , joined in the civil war in @entity11			0
it tried to join other @entity143 groups , even declaring it had merged with the @entity191 , @entity162 's proxy in @entity11			2
but @entity193 and @entity162 rejected the merger			0
eventually , the clash with @entity162 ended in a dramatic clash between @entity10 and other @entity11 opposition groups and a total break with @entity162			1
incredibly , @entity162 , the perpetrator of 9/11 and countless other mass murders of civilians around the world , criticized @entity10 for being too ruthless			1
the horrifying @entity10 videos and photographs presage much more carnage ahead for @entity5			1
but they also signal that this twisted @entity208 campaign will spawn a wave of popular resentment that will no doubt undermine and weaken the group 's hold on the country .			1

@entity215 : @entity10 has launched a sophisticated @entity208 campaign to scare @entity5
@entity218 : the group likes to publicize its horrific deeds , but this will surely backfire
she says , incredibly , even @entity162 has criticized @entity10 for being too ruthless
@entity218 : @entity10 's brutal tactics create enemies ; @entity5 will not embrace the group 's rule
