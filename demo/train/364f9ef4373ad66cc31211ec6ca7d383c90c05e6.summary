@entity0 -- the emergency room doctor who declared @entity4 dead testified monday in the involuntary manslaughter trial of dr. @entity6 that there was no way doctors could have revived the pop icon after he arrived at the hospital			1
dr. @entity12 testified friday that @entity6 never told her that he had given @entity4 the surgical anesthetic propofol before he stopped breathing , but she said monday it would not have made a difference if he had because @entity4 " had died long before			1
" " it is unlikely with that information that i would have been able to do something different that would have changed the outcome , " @entity17 said			0
prosecutors argue that @entity6 's failure to tell paramedics and doctors trying to resuscitate @entity4 about the propofol is one of the negligent acts that make him criminally responsible for @entity4 's death			1
another doctor testified monday that the decision to place an aortic balloon pump in @entity4 's heart was " a desperate attempt , even though very much futile " effort intended " to prepare dr. @entity6 mentally to accept the fact that mr. @entity4 could not be rescued and would allow mr. @entity4 to depart in peace and dignity			1
" dr. @entity40 said @entity6 asked that " we not to give up easily and try to save mr. @entity4 's life , " @entity40 said , even though it seemed hopeless			1

the coroner ruled that @entity4 's june 25 , 2009 , death was the result of " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with sedatives			1
dr. @entity17 had recommended at 12:57 p.m. , when @entity4 was still at his home , that paramedics stop resuscitation efforts and declare him dead			2
@entity4 was the first patient she had ever treated in the emergency room after having made such a recommendation to paramedics in the field , she said			0
" i have never given a time of death in the field and then have that patient brought to me , " she said			0
she said this exception was not because @entity4 was a celebrity , but because the patient had a physician with them who did not want them to give up			0

" dr. @entity131 's testimony was important for the prosecution because she is one of the several people who spoke to dr. @entity6 on the phone the morning @entity4 died			1

dr. @entity131 called @entity6 's cell phone to get his advice on a patient he had treated who was about to undergo surgery at a @entity121 hospital			2
most doctors she calls in such circumstances have to call back after consulting medical charts , she said , but @entity6 recalled the correct information immediately			0
prosecutors also called the first of three of @entity6 's girlfriends to the witness stand to talk about their conversations with the doctor just before he realized @entity4 had stopped breathing the judge prevented the prosecution from digging into the personal relationship between @entity6 and @entity160 , who previously testified at @entity6 's preliminary hearing about meeting the married doctor in a @entity164 night club in 2003			1
@entity160 's call to @entity6 came about 30 minutes before @entity6 apparently discovered there was a problem with his patient			0
@entity169 , a cocktail waitress who met @entity6 when she was working at a @entity121 steakhouse , is likely to be one of the first witnesses tuesday			0
@entity174 testified in january that she was on the phone with @entity6 when he suddenly stopped responding to her just before noon the day @entity4 died			2
that is the moment prosecutors contend @entity6 first realized that @entity4 had stopped breathing			2
" i did n't hear him on the phone any more , " @entity174 said			0
" i heard commotion as if the phone was in a pocket and i heard coughing and i heard a mumbling of voices			0
" @entity174 said she stayed on the phone for another five minutes , listening and wondering why the man she sometimes dated was n't responding			0
" hello , hello , are you there ? " she testified she said			0
the timing of the phone call is key to the prosecution 's time line of when @entity6 realized his famous patient was dying			0
based on testimony so far , the moment came at 11:57 p.m. @entity196 , the mother of @entity6 's youngest child , may follow them on the witness stand			1
her testimony is especially important because the propofol @entity6 used on @entity4 was shipped to her @entity203 , @entity204 , apartment			2
@entity205 , 29 , who met @entity6 around 2005 in a @entity164 gentlemen 's club , made it clear when she previously testified that she knew little about the doctor 's activities			2
" dr. @entity6 and i were on a need - to - know basis , and i just know my place and my position in his life , " @entity205 said			2
@entity6 called @entity205 from the ambulance as he accompanied @entity4 to the hospital , according to testimony in the preliminary hearing			2
representatives from two cell phone companies testified monday morning about records of calls to and from @entity6 's cell phones the morning @entity4 died			1
the call times play a key role in determining the time line of what @entity6 was doing in the hours before @entity4 's death			1

however , the prosecution has been following the same order of witnesses used in @entity6 's preliminary hearing in january			0
@entity238 homicide detective @entity237 , who led the @entity240 investigation of @entity4 's death , is likely to testify tuesday or wednesday			1
@entity242 investigator @entity241 will probably testify within the next two days about searching @entity4 's home after his death			1

@entity6 's defense lawyers contend @entity4 caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while @entity6 was out of the room			1
the judge imposed a gag order friday , preventing lawyers for @entity6 from talking to reporters about the case			0
his order came after he learned @entity263 , a law partner to lead defense lawyer @entity265 , gave a television interview to @entity269 's @entity268 on friday morning			0
if convicted of involuntary manslaughter , @entity6 could spend four years in a @entity204 prison and lose his medical license .			0
