@entity0 -- two state supreme court justices from neighboring states find themselves in disagreement these days -- not over a legal issue , but over how they should have gotten their jobs			2
the two justices , @entity9 chief justice @entity8 and @entity11 justice @entity10 , were both elected in statewide votes			1
@entity14 said having to raise funds can erode public confidence in the courts			0
" going out asking for money creates a real strain in my judicial work , and i ca n't promise or predict to voters how i would decide a particular issue , " @entity14 said			0
" it conflicts with the idea that judges are and should be impartial and not be influenced by anything , especially money			2
" but as @entity11 's newest elected high court member , @entity10 said it was a treat visiting all of his state 's 67 counties on his @entity33 motorcycle			1
" that 's the beauty of having electoral process where we need to be responsive to the community , " said the @entity35 former cop - turned - judge			1
" and i think it 's important that judges should be out there			1
it 's just as important as other elected officials			1
" the experiences of both men are now at the forefront of a growing national debate over selecting judges			1
twenty - one states have some sort of contested system for top judges			1
the other 29 states , along with the @entity0 and the federal government , appoint their judges , often under a merit - based selection system in which the governor gets the final say			1
some , including retired @entity62 @entity61 justice @entity60 , are pushing for reform , saying election - based systems could raise doubts about a judge 's impartiality			1
" studies show that roughly 70 percent of the public believe judges are influenced by campaign contributions , and more than one quarter of judges agree , " @entity60 said in an exclusive interview with @entity1			1
" this is alarming because the legitimacy of the judiciary rests entirely on its promise to be fair and impartial			0
a judge 's sole constituency should be the law			1
if the public loses faith in that impartiality , then there is no reason to prefer the judge 's interpretation of the law to the opinions of the real politicians representing the electorate			1
" @entity60 is lending her reputation , her energy and her name to a new project , the @entity97			0
the initiative assists state - level efforts to name judges by merit - based selection systems , not elections			1
" this initiative is a matter of great importance to our country , " @entity60 said			0
" the amount of money poured into judicial campaigns has skyrocketed , intensifying the need to re-examine how we choose judges in @entity62			2
i believe it is our moral duty and obligation to restore the public 's confidence in our judicial system			2
" the @entity97 was created by the @entity121 , @entity122 - based @entity120 of the @entity123			0
the group 's founder and director , @entity127 , said @entity60 has long been a passionate defender of judicial independence			0
" @entity60 adds practical experience with a system [ in her home state of @entity133 ] that works , and she adds a perception of balance and moderation [ in ] that she has never been associated in the minds of the public with extremes on either side of the political ledger , " said @entity127 , a retired justice from @entity122 's @entity61			1
@entity127 said she senses increased momentum for change on the national level , partly because of a @entity62 @entity61 ruling in june that arose from a judicial scandal in @entity148			2
in the so - called @entity149 , the @entity62 @entity61 found that @entity151 justice @entity150 acted improperly when he refused to remove himself from a 2006 civil appeal			1
the court ruled that there was a perceived conflict of interest in the 2006 case because @entity150 had previously received financial support from the ceo of the key defendant			0
" what the [ @entity62 @entity61 ] made clear in ' @entity149 ' was that judges are different , that campaign donations need to be thought of in a different way when those donations are going to fund a judicial campaign , " @entity127 said			1
" it put on the front burner those questions of propriety with respect to campaign donations to judges and how that impacts people 's perception of impartiality on the bench			1
" @entity179 has scheduled a ballot initiative that could make it the first state in 15 years to switch from a voter - based selection of judges to a merit - based selection			2
@entity9 , too , has begun rethinking its voter - based system			2
@entity14 , who has been through four elections on the state high court , said he notices voters growing more skeptical of judges			0
that perception , he said , is fueled in part by negative ads from political and business interests with a stake in elections			0
" the only way to eliminate the public distrust is to eliminate money from the process , " @entity14 said			0
@entity14 is heading an effort that would give the governor and an independent review panel the power to select state judges			0
voters could then decide a few years later whether to retain those justices			0
many states that choose judges by merit also have accountability systems that include independent performance evaluations and retention votes			2
supporters call that a transparent , unbiased tool for the public to essentially " judge the judge " on their record			0
@entity10 knows his personality and personal story helped get him elected			0
an @entity223 immigrant , he used his law enforcement background to get a spot as a @entity35 trial judge , famously dealing with unruly football fans at the small " @entity228 " underneath @entity229			0
the bald , burly judge with an easy grin was elected in 2007 and says he enjoys his work			2
" i 'm electable , not appointable , " he said during the run for his seat			0
" if i 'm elevated , i am responsible to the citizens -- not the governor , not the folks who talk about merit selection			0
" @entity10 calls the merit - based system " elitist			1
" the 19 states that held state supreme court elections in 2007 spent a combined $ 34.4 million , shattering previous campaign spending records			2
in 2008 , nearly $ 20 million was spent on tv advertising for the 15 states that held contested elections for 26 supreme court seats			2
the political and financial stakes have become enormous , from ideological groups sparring over abortion rights and gay marriage to business groups dueling with trial lawyers over multibillion - dollar punitive damage awards			0
reform advocates say judicial independence comes only with public confidence in the system			1
" people do n't like the notion of cash in the courtroom -- any whiff of any expectation that judges can be bought is just not acceptable in our country , " @entity127 said			0
" people understand how important it is to have an impartial judge			0
from your own personal perspective , walking into a courthouse , you do n't want to be asking whether that adverse party donated to that judge 's campaign			1

former @entity61 justice wants to reform the way judges are chosen
twenty - one states have some sort of contested system for selecting judges
reform advocates say campaign contributions can bring judges ' impartiality into question
elected judge in @entity11 says it 's " elitist " to appoint judges
