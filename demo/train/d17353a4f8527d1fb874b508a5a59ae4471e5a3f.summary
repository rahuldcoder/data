-- april 30 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : @entity15 is awesome ! especially when it falls on a friday			2
to celebrate , we are branching out into a bunch of topics in today 's show			2
let 's get to it			2
first up : oil update @entity26 : the federal government will use " every single available resource " to help contain that oil spill in the @entity4			1
the secretary of @entity31 declared it an incident of " national significance			1
" what that means is that resources from other parts of the country can be used to try and control the spill			1
@entity42 governor @entity41 already declared a state of emergency to help free up resources for the effort			2
yesterday afternoon , the oil was about 16 miles off the @entity42 coast and headed toward shore			1
when it does start hitting the coast , it could threaten hundreds of species of wildlife : birds , shrimp , crabs , otters			2
in fact , the entire @entity56 fishing industry could be affected			2
yesterday , we told you that the @entity60 was going to try and contain part of the spill by setting it on fire			1
they did ; you can see the smoke from that fire right here			2
they were hoping to set another controlled burn yesterday , but the weather was n't cooperating			2
some authorities think this spill is getting worse , much worse			1
at first , the estimate was that the spill was leaking out about a thousand barrels of oil per day			1
now , the @entity60 is saying that 's increased to as many as 5,000 barrels			2
that 's more than 200,000 gallons per day			2
financial reform @entity26 : the @entity81 is ready to debate a financial reform bill			1
when you hear the word debate , you mighty think of people being on opposite sides of something			1
this time , everyone agrees ! they all want to debate			1
republicans and @entity92 had been working on this bill in private sessions			2
they disagreed on some parts of it , and the @entity98 -- plus a few @entity92 -- blocked it from moving forward until those differences could be worked out			2
late wednesday , they changed their minds			2
every senator , @entity98 and @entity104 , voted to start debate			1
immigration reform @entity26 : the @entity81 's looking at taking up another controversial issue : immigration reform			2
some @entity92 senators were planning to release a new proposal late yesterday			2
it would increase the number of border patrol officers and make it tougher to hire illegal workers			2
plus , it outlines a process to legalize the millions of illegal immigrants in the @entity120 one @entity98 leader says the proposal is just an attempt to get voters out for november 's midterm elections			1
he says there 's no chance that immigration reform will move through @entity128			2
some @entity92 sources say the same thing , that the odds of this passing the @entity81 this year are pretty slim			0
word to the @entity134 @entity135 , @entity14 : a word to the @entity134 ... calorie ( noun ) a unit of energy or heat that is often associated with food @entity142 @entity26 : your body needs calories for energy ; they fuel everything you do			1
but if you get too many of them or do n't burn them off with exercise , those calories can turn to fat			0
lawmakers in part of @entity6 say that some fast food kids ' meals have too many calories			1
they believe one way to discourage kids from wanting those meals is to ban the toys that come with them			1
so , the new rule in @entity5 , @entity6 : kids ' meals with more than 485 calories get no toy			1
kids ' meals with less calories can still include the toy			1
there are also limits on fat and sodium , or salt			0
one lawmaker says this will help fight childhood obesity and " breaks the link between unhealthy food and prizes			1
" but the @entity183 thinks the rule goes too far , and some critics say parents should be responsible for what their children eat			0
@entity189 @entity26 : this led us to consider a question that 's kind of like the video game question we asked the other day : who 's responsible here ? who should decide on calories ? is it the government ? should restaurants be responsible ? should parents be responsible ? go to our blog , tell us your opinion			0
this day in history ( @entity209 ) april 30 , 1789 - @entity210 is inaugurated as first president of the @entity120 april 30 , 1803 - negotiations conclude on @entity213 , which doubles the size of the @entity120 april 30 , 1975 - @entity215 surrenders to the @entity216 , ending the @entity217 ; remaining @entity120 are evacuated from @entity218 @entity219 @entity220 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to everyone whose parents serve in the @entity224 ! what branch of the @entity120 military was founded first ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it the : a ) @entity233 , b ) @entity232 , c ) @entity234 or @entity235 ) @entity236 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity233 was established first , way back in june of 1775			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! military child @entity26 : the @entity241 pays tribute to people whose parents serve in all branches of the military			1
1.7 million @entity120 kids have a parent who serves , and this month recognizes their sacrifices ; for example , when your mom or dad is away for months at a time			1
@entity253 shows us how the military is helping families stay in touch			1
( begin video ) @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 : so , where 's your daddy at ? @entity263 , military child : on a ship			1
@entity266 : on a ship ? @entity266 : three - year - old @entity268 ca n't wait for daddy to come home			0
@entity271 , married to @entity120 naval officer : i have to explain to him that daddy 's working			1
but he 's like , " but when is daddy coming home ? " @entity266 : daddy is navy chief @entity279 , currently on the @entity281 @entity280 , deployed in the @entity282			0
@entity268 has been deployed for six months ; his family eagerly awaits his return			0
@entity285 : where do you see daddy ? do you see daddy on the tv ? @entity290 : yeah			0
@entity266 : this is @entity268 's 9th deployment			0
but this one is different thanks to a program his kids affectionately call the " @entity296			1
" @entity285 : press play			0
back up so you can see daddy			0
@entity266 : through a non-profit program called @entity302 through @entity303 , deployed service members can choose a book and record videos from their base to read aloud to their children			1
@entity308 @entity279 , @entity232 : today , i 'm going to read , the book is called " @entity310			1
" @entity290 : " @entity310 ! " @entity266 : programs like this one that help keep families connected are becoming increasingly popular in the military			1
when service members with kids are deployed for long stretches , psychologists say it 's the children who feel it the most			1
@entity322 , zero to three : some children may withdraw and you have a difficult time talking about their experience			0
or some children are very aggressive and you might see them crying a lot or having trouble sleeping			0
@entity266 : but with these videos , smiles often replace tears , especially for the @entity268 family			0
@entity335 , military child : it 's , like , better because i get to see him and he 'll get to talk with me and stuff on the videos			1
@entity266 : do you see a difference in your kids ? @entity285 : yes , yes			1
now , he thinks daddy 's around more			0
@entity266 : it 's also a major morale boost for the parent serving far away			0
@entity349 : i know it 's helping me out a lot , especially knowing the response that 's coming from it			0
just mentally , calming me down and enabling me to stay focused at my job			0
i love all of you			0
muah ! @entity290 : muah ! @entity266 : with the country engaged in two wars and many service members facing multiple deployments , the military is expanding and promoting programs which help ease the strain on families			1
@entity253 , @entity0 , @entity365 , @entity366			1
( @entity367 ) comments @entity26 : okay , at @entity370 / @entity369 , a student named @entity372 called our attention to the @entity241			1
he told us about his experience as one -- the service and the sacrifice -- and we asked for your experiences as well			0
@entity382 described it as an adventure , just by moving around and making new friends along the way			0
@entity387 says it can be hard to keep friendships with the frequent moves , but that he 's grown up learning respect and flexibility			0
@entity393 says the hardest part is the time his dad spends away from home , but that he could n't be any more proud as his son			0
and @entity398 says it 's hard because his family makes sacrifices , but it 's for a big cause			0
we thank and salute all of you military kids out there for your sacrifices			1
before we go @entity26 : and before we leave you today , you 've heard of electronic music			0
this would be the literal version : a mechanical marimba player			0
he 's not just banging out some pre-planned tune , either			0
this is jazz , and he 's improvising , learning what his fellow musicians are doing and then adapting to it			0
at least , that 's what they claim			0
now , before any of you get worried about robots ruling the music industry , the point here is the interaction : man and machine working together			0
goodbye @entity26 : and that sounds just fine to us , because do you really think a robots - only band would play jazz ? there 's no chance			0
they 'd totally be metal			0
so , while you 've got some time over the weekend , why not send us an @entity442 with a shoutout to your favorite teacher ? you , and i mean you , could be featured on our show ! find out how to send us an @entity442 at @entity207			0
