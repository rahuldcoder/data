-- @entity2 regulators recommended a record $ 2.25 billion fine for the state 's largest utility monday in the gas pipeline explosion that killed eight people in a @entity9 suburb			1
if approved by the @entity12 , the proposed fine for @entity11 would be the largest ever imposed by a state regulator			1
@entity14 , the head of the agency 's safety and enforcement decision , said " every penny " should go toward safety improvements			2
" there is no amount of money that will bring back the eight people who tragically lost their lives in the pipeline blast or heal the lasting wounds to the people of @entity29 , " @entity14 said in a statement announcing the decision			1
" all we can do is make sure such a tragedy does not happen again			0
" the september 2010 explosion destroyed 38 homes and left a 72 - foot by 26 - foot crater in the middle of a neighborhood in @entity29 , near @entity37			1
federal investigators found the pipeline at the heart of the blast was inadequate even when installed in 1956			2
there was no immediate reaction to the announcement from @entity11 , which accepted responsibility for the explosion in december 2011			2
the company has until may 24 to file a response to the recommendation , and the commission says it expects to decide on the penalty in late summer			1
