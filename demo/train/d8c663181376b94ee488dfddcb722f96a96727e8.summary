the winner of the 2012 commencement sweepstakes is in			2
it 's @entity3 , which just announced that president @entity4 will be the featured speaker at its may 14 graduation ceremonies			1
the choice benefits both the president and @entity3 , a 123 - year - old women 's college in @entity11			1
@entity3 outdoes neighboring @entity12 and every other @entity14 college when it comes to commencement prestige			1
@entity4 , in turn , gets the perfect setting to talk about women 's rights			1
the @entity20 have made a national issue of limiting access to contraception , and @entity3 provides the president with a forum to make his views on the subject clear			1
this comes at a time when the @entity30 reports that of the 43 million fertile @entity32 women who do not want to get pregnant , 89 % are practicing birth control			1
in the @entity37 college paper , the president 's commencement address was the lead story monday and a source of controversy and envy			1
@entity3 students often take classes at @entity12 , which actually confers the @entity3 diplomas			1
@entity4 clearly trumps @entity12 's commencement speaker , @entity46 , the president and publisher of @entity49			1
but @entity3 's coup in securing the president , whose aides contacted @entity3 last week , according to university president @entity54 , raises an important question : how do colleges choose their commencement speakers ? at institutions that pride themselves on being democratic , the process all too rarely involves meaningful consultation			1
sometimes , students are asked whom they want for a speaker			2
occasionally , faculty members are solicited for their opinion			0
but the asking around is most often window dressing			0
usually , the commencement speaker is chosen by a college president or key administrator			2
in @entity3 's case , @entity71 , the executive editor of the @entity72 , was the announced speaker			1
but when @entity4 became available , @entity71 was quickly dropped			2
as critics have noted , so much for a women 's college worrying about favoring a powerful man over a woman ! in an age when budgets are stretched thin , many colleges are still willing to pay thousands of dollars to get the most newsworthy person they can find to address their graduating seniors			1
a famous commencement speaker is an expense that colleges believe will pay dividends down the line			2
perhaps colleges are right ? maybe the commencement game is worth playing to the hilt			0
but i think it is equally possible that colleges are kidding themselves			0
my alternative is that colleges should try choosing their commencement speakers according to the following rules : 1			0
ask the senior class whom it wants to hear at its graduation , and publish the results early in the fall			0
make sure the seniors know who is available to speak			0
require the commencement speaker to donate any lecture fees to the college scholarship fund and not profit from an invitation that should be considered an educational honor			2
insist that the speakers talk no longer than 15 minutes and never use the phrase " real world			0
strongly urge the speaker to recall what the world felt like when he or she was 22			0
these five rules should do the trick , but it is important to remember that there are always exceptions			0
the wise college wo n't try to control every facet of commencement			2
it will allow for surprises			0
the most important commencement address in modern @entity32 history occurred june 5 , 1947 , at @entity129 , when secretary of state and former army chief of staff @entity130 delivered the talk that became the basis for the @entity134			1
nobody anticipated how momentous @entity130 's address would be			1
he spoke for just 12 minutes , and all he said to @entity129 president @entity137 in advance was that he intended " to make a few remarks in appreciation of the honor and perhaps a little more			0
" my ideal commencement speaker for 2012 , as i have told anyone who will listen , would be @entity145 , who turns 80 in december			0
@entity145 is , i believe , our greatest living rock ' n ' roller , and one rendition of " @entity150 " by him would make even the most humdrum commencement magical			0
but few of the students i teach would agree with me about @entity145 , and i am easy about bowing to their wishes			0
commencement is , it can not be stressed enough , their day : it should be about who and what they think is important .			2

@entity163 : @entity3 wins commencement prize with @entity4 , to @entity12 's *dismay*
@entity167 : women 's college @entity3 is the perfect stage for @entity4 to speak on women 's rights
universities are democratic , he says , so students should have a say in who speaks
milles : gen. @entity130 gave the most important commencement address in @entity32 history
