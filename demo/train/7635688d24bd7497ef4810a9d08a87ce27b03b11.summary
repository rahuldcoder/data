-- being a world leader does n't necessarily mean being a fashion leader			1
it also does n't make you immune to that awkward part of the international travel deal -- occasionally giving in to the demands of your local hosts and doing something you would n't normally do , all in the name of cross-cultural comity			2
taken each year ( with some exemptions ) in the traditional or often jazzed - up garb of the host country , the famed @entity12 ( @entity12 ) " family photo " ( it 's also been called the " silly shirts " photo ) dates to the first @entity12 held near @entity19 in 1993			1

but as the photos spread around the world , many thought they were attending a @entity79 convention rather than a state banquet , with the outfits resembling those sported by @entity83 or @entity84			0
host @entity63 president @entity85 worked his silky tunic but the awkward expressions of @entity26 president @entity88 and @entity90 leader @entity89 suggested many guests wished they could be transported away from the pomp and protocol by using the hit show 's immortal catchphrase : " @entity96 me up , @entity97			0
