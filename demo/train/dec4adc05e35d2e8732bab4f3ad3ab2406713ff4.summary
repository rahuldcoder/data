editor 's note : @entity2 , the former @entity3 majority leader of the @entity4 , is a physician			1
he was elected to represent @entity5 in the @entity4 in 1994 and served two terms before deciding not to run for re-election in 2006			1
former senate majority leader @entity2 says it 's good that @entity9 and @entity10 are members of the @entity4			1
@entity12 , @entity5 ( @entity13 ) -- now is the time for a new beginning			1
and how it is approached may well turn on the often overlooked fact that both the president - elect and the vice president - elect are products of the @entity4			1
@entity21 shines at her best in times of challenge , and never in my adult life have we seen more challenge coming from more dimensions			1
i encourage republicans to rally behind this president - elect and openly express support for the call for change throughout our legislative and executive branches			0
i encourage @entity35 not to repeat the missteps made by @entity3 by excluding thoughtful debate			0
and i encourage the @entity21 people to stay involved with the intensity manifested by heightened participation in the democratic process			1
my teaching on the @entity44 campus last year revealed to me an explosion of energizing interest in " the system " and how to make it better from within -- very different from when i was there 38 years ago and the same activism was channeled toward tearing it down			0
the wounds of the campaign are not as deep or angry as the media portray			0
for many , there is disappointment , and this must be consoled with time and discussion ; for more , there is a sense of hope and quiet optimism that fresh ideas and new faces and commitment to collaboration can , if handled with care and grace , nurture a new prosperity			2
having served in the @entity4 , i am proud that that body , historically avoided as a source of presidential leadership , produced three of the four candidates and now the president and vice president			1
the @entity4 is a strange animal			1
unlike the @entity77 , it is weighted to give the minority party exceptional power			2
and that 's why we have these super-majority ( and , to the public , usually hard to fathom ! ) thresholds like cloture and the filibuster			2
both of our new leaders are creatures of this body , a body that our founding fathers deliberately elevated to one of deliberation and discussion and unlimited debate and enhanced minority power			2
that unique @entity4 legislative experience of the president - and vice-president - elect -- with the understanding it brings both to lead on principle but govern with compromise and to respect uniquely the minority 's participation -- stations them ideally for a time when the @entity21 people expect their government to work together to aggressively attack the problems that face us			1
my former colleague @entity112 returns to the @entity4 to participate with a style that fits the time			1
what made my life tough at times as leader -- his working on his own agenda , working almost obsessively across the aisle , putting principle before party and defending through passionate debate his conservative views -- is what can make him an effective force in shaping the change that these elections spoke so loudly to			0
and to the president - elect , what an opportunity ! times are tough , but the people have rallied to your call			0
you have the followers ; you have the believers ; even your loudest critics recognize that you are endowed with leadership talents that are precious			0
to move the nation forward , keep listening to the @entity21 people			1
be straight with them , and do n't over-promise			0
fill the gaps where you lack experience with the brightest minds with the highest values			0
ireport.com : share your message for @entity9 and finally , though this may appear a bit self - serving , the doctor in me is shouting out not to forget an issue that has been driven to the background by the credit markets , job losses and threats overseas : health care			1
ever - rising health costs drive people to the ranks of uninsured			0
the 15 million hard - core uninsured need your immediate attention			0
there is nothing more intimate or more personal to any of us than the health of our loved ones			0
do n't let it slip to the back burner			0
so , even in these tough and depressing times defined by an economic crisis that will -- yes , will -- have an end , i am pretty excited about the future			0
let 's all play our part as citizens of the greatest and freest country in the world			2
the opinions expressed in the commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 says we *'re* *fortunate* @entity9 , @entity10 were in the @entity4
