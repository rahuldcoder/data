first a meteor exploded over @entity1 , followed closely by an asteroid fly - by			2
now , two comets are expected to put on a naked - eye spectacle for sky watchers in the @entity6			1
up first is @entity7 , which gets its funky name from the telescope credited with discovering it in june 2001 : the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the comet is already visible through telescopes in the @entity15 , and it should swing into view over the @entity6 beginning around march 8			1
it 's hard to predict exactly how bright pan-starrs will be , but you should be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes , said @entity22 of @entity24 's @entity23			2
it should be about as bright as the stars in the @entity27			2
science seat : @entity22 " there is a chance that it will be a little brighter than this , but likewise , it might not get quite that bright , " said @entity29 of the @entity30 graphic : how to tell space rocks apart part of the brightness will depend on how close @entity7 gets to the sun. @entity38 are made up of water , ice , dust and other elements and minerals , all loosely packed together , @entity29 said			1
as a comet gets closer to the sun , the sun 's heat causes these elements to melt , spewing out dust and gas in a brilliant tail			2
" the closer it gets , the more intense the radiation and the more elements will be melted , " he said			2
pan-starrs is expected to get fairly close to the sun. that 's bad news for the comet , but it could be a boon for sky watchers if the comet is brighter and easier to see			1
pan-starrs also could fall apart and fizzle			0
but if it survives its sunbath , we should be able to see it low on the horizon in the western sky for a couple of weeks , @entity29 said			1
" about half an hour after sunset would be a good time for people take a look , " he said			0
here are some key dates : march 5 : pan-starrs will be closest to @entity77 ; march 10 : the comet will pass closest to the sun ; march 12 and 13 : the best dates to look for pan-starrs ; it should emerge in the western sunset sky not far from the crescent moon			1
@entity29 has these viewing tips : 1 ) safety first : do n't try to look at the comet until the sun sets			0
do not look at the sun using regular binoculars or telescopes			0
ever ! you 'll burn up your eyes			1
2 ) @entity7 will stay close to the horizon , so you 'll need to get away from trees and buildings			1
3 ) look carefully ! the sky will still be bright at dusk , which can make it hard to spot comets			0
4 ) if the skies are clear , and you are away from city light pollution , you may be able to see the comet with your bare eyes			0
if not , use binoculars			0
5 ) if you ca n't escape the city , try using binoculars			0
second chance to catch a comet if your quest to see the first comet does n't pan out -- get it ? ( ok , that 's bad ) -- we might get to see a better comet later in 2013 : @entity117			1
@entity117 was discovered by @entity1 astronomers @entity119 and @entity120 in september 2012			1
it 's named after their night - sky survey program , the @entity123			0
some early comet prognosticators -- and reporters -- have tagged @entity117 " the @entity126			1
" but @entity22 is n't buying it just yet			0
he remembers being duped by another comet with that same moniker			0
in 1973 , @entity130 was hyped , too , and it fizzled			0
" predicting the behavior of comets is like predicting the behavior of cats -- ca n't really be done , " he said			0
so here is the hype on @entity117 : on november 28 , it is expected to dive into the sun 's atmosphere			1
if it survives , it might glow as brightly as the moon and be briefly visible in daylight			0
its tail might stretch far across the night sky			0
@entity29 is optimistic , but he said we wo n't know until late summer what to expect from @entity117			1
" i 'll be surprised if we do n't have a bright comet this fall and / or winter , but it 's still just too early to speculate , " he said			2
so , like @entity7 , @entity117 's fate will be decided by the sun. it could burn brightly and earn that " @entity155 " title ; it could melt or it could just break apart			1
scientists say neither comet poses any threat to @entity77 , but if both comets hold together , sky watchers will get a rare treat : two comets , both bright enough to be seen with the naked eye , in one year			2
fingers crossed ! more space and science news from @entity168 @entity167			0

@entity7 will swing into view over the @entity6 beginning march 7
it will stay close to the horizon , so you 'll need to get away from trees and buildings to see it
@entity117 will pass by this year , but scientist is *skeptical* of " @entity126 " predictions
