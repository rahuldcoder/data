republicans who want to taint @entity1 are going to lengths to link the former secretary of state with president @entity4 and his sagging poll numbers			1
throughout the party 's infrastructure , @entity0 say that linking @entity8 with @entity4 , especially labeling her possible 2016 campaign as " @entity4 's @entity11 , " is the most potent attack			1
@entity13 , an @entity14 that has looked to define the former first lady for the better part of a year , will push out a series of talking points giving @entity8 the third - term label , and the group plans to fundraise off the push staring tuesday			2
" @entity1 has a @entity4 problem , " reads a lengthy research document that will go out to @entity0 pundits , strategists , conservative organizations and media members tuesday			1
" no matter how many of her advisors whisper to reporters that she 's different from @entity4 , @entity28 still know who she is : @entity34			2
" the document lists " 10 reasons why @entity8 2016 = @entity4 's @entity11 , " including her praise for @entity4 as she left the @entity39 in 2013 , her role in his first four years of foreign policy and @entity8 's support of @entity44			1
" looking ahead to 2016 , it 's critical that @entity4 's 3rd term is an element of the broader narrative defining @entity8 , especially since she still has a higher approval than he does , " @entity45 , the group 's director , said in a statement to @entity48			1
multiple @entity0 operatives said this strategy -- which is coming from national party groups , outside super pacs and @entity0 politicians -- is best at engaging the base and raising money			1
therefore , it is something they plan to continue in the coming months and possibly years			0
democrats , too , are concerned about the attack line			0
in august , some close to @entity8 told @entity48 that labeling the former secretary of state as the successor to @entity4 's legacy was a possible problem			1
" she was in his government , she was at his side , " said one source			0
" that is , the way to go after her is four more years of the same old thing			0
the question they should ask her is ' tell me 10 things that you disagree with him on			0
' " @entity0 lawmakers -- including those who may challenge @entity8 in 2016 -- have been quick to use some variation of @entity4 - @entity8 in speeches , statements and interviews			1
@entity1 's fall to - do list @entity0 sen. @entity96 of @entity97 has been the most strident in linking @entity4 and @entity8 , a tactic he first used after the former secretary of state headlined a @entity48 town hall in june			1
" the most consistent error of the @entity8 / @entity4 foreign policy is a failure to understand the nature of the people we 're dealing with , of our enemies , " @entity96 said in an interview with @entity48 after the event			1
according to a senior @entity96 aide , the attack engages the senator 's base and is something @entity96 plans to use again			2
" his mindset is it is not just @entity4 's failed policies , it is all of them , " the aide said			2
" we want to draw attention to the fact that she owns this foreign policy and she is not speaking			0
she is supposed to be the leader , especially on foreign policy , and she is saying nothing			0
she has a voice , she does n't use it			0
" sens. @entity127 and @entity129 , too , have been linking the two			0
in an op - ed earlier this month , @entity127 called for voters to reject the " the veiled isolationism of @entity4 and @entity8 , " and @entity129 has looked to link the two on issues including terrorism and @entity134			1
for her part , @entity8 has both distanced herself from @entity4 and drawn closer to him			1
in her memoir , " @entity141 , " @entity8 distanced herself from @entity4 on @entity134 and did so again in a much - talked - about interview with the @entity140			2
but the former secretary of state has also heralded @entity4 , like in @entity143 this month when she touted his handling of economic issues as getting the country " on the road to recovery			2
" this is a common refrain for @entity8			0
at the @entity151 this month , she touted @entity4 's " extraordinary leadership , " adding " thanks to the economic policies that were pursued by the president and endorsed by the @entity155 ... we are in a much stronger economic position than we were			2
" whether she will continue this trend of heralding @entity4 while also distancing herself depends , according to former aides			0
@entity162 , a @entity48 contributor and @entity165 's 2000 campaign manager , said whether or not @entity8 needs to break with @entity4 " all depends on the political climate and environment in mid- 2015 to 2016			1
" " in 2000 , i had to answer this question , " she said			0
" and the answer is always the same			0
each year is different and every candidate must make his or her case to the voter of why they represent someone else			0

republicans seeking to taint @entity1 want to tie her to @entity4
the president 's poll numbers are *slumping*
and @entity0 hope the attack will raise money and *excitement*
an *anti-clinton* super pac is *launching* a new effort to link @entity8 to @entity4
