two days ago we heard that dr. sheik @entity1 , a leading doctor from @entity2 specializing in viral hemorrhagic fever , had died aged 39			1
he contracted the ebola virus while treating more than 100 patients and was called a " national hero " by the government			0
@entity1 's sickness added to fear and vulnerability felt by many doctors and nurses treating @entity15 patients			1
they reasoned " if even dr. @entity1 can get sick , then any of us can			2
" @entity2 's health facilities were struggling to cope even before this outbreak			1
the country has a major shortage of doctors , nurses and infrastructure , meaning we 're all working in challenging circumstances			2
tracing people who have had contact with @entity15 sufferers is very difficult , and made more challenging by poor roads and overcrowded housing			1
amongst the wider @entity2 population we 've seen a lot of mistrust -- many people believe that @entity15 is a government myth created to steal their organs or money			1
others believe that if they go to hospital they will be killed			0
so many hide at home and are cared for by relatives -- who then get sick themselves			0
some patients have escaped from hospitals with relatives ' help			0
during this crisis , the @entity50 's team have all faced difficult questions			1
the most fundamental being whether our organization should be involved in the @entity15 response at all			1
our work at @entity57 in @entity58 was not hands - on clinical care but consulting on how to strengthen the health system over the long term			1
although our small team is highly qualified , we did n't really have the funding or equipment to deal with such an outbreak			1
but after team discussions and with senior colleagues back at @entity50 in @entity70 we decided that as an organization we had a duty to respond and that we had the capacity to do so safely and effectively			2
all our staff are volunteers and this is n't what they originally signed up for -- so we gave them the option to withdraw from clinical activities if they wanted to			2
we were , however , fortunate to have dr. @entity81 on hand -- our infectious diseases adviser in the @entity84 , who has experience with viral hemorrhagic fever			2
rumors and misinformation within hours of the first @entity91 meeting in @entity2 , the @entity50 's team was invited to join the response , advising @entity57 on how to develop a preparedness plan , identify cases , set up isolation units , protect staff and dispose of medical waste			1
these guidelines were held up as a model for other hospitals , and we continue to act as advisers to the @entity102 , along with groups such as @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity106			0
as the @entity50 's team ran urgent training for nursing and medical staff at @entity57 , suspected cases began to emerge			1
rumors and misinformation were rife with a nurse having been one of the first victims			0
the fear amongst hospital staff was palpable			2
we found ourselves amongst the first responders , alongside heroic @entity118 colleagues such as @entity119 ( sister - in - charge of @entity121 ) and dr. @entity122 ( consultant physician ) who did not hesitate to step forward and manage the response			1
@entity124 worked into the night to set up an expanded isolation unit and now work to provide treatment and take blood specimens			0
it is sweaty and exhausting work , scrubbing floors with bleach in full gowns , masks and protective clothing in the intense rainy season heat			0
we immediately isolate anyone who shows symptoms			0
they sometimes have to wait three to four days for the lab results			0
about a quarter of the patients who have been isolated have died at @entity57 , meaning most recover or are referred for treatment elsewhere			0
most health workers are still coming to work , but almost everyone is afraid			0
we 're all aware of how much is at stake			0
we ask ourselves -- are we acting beyond our competency and putting ourselves at risk ? @entity15 is the main conversation , in government , the media and on the street			1
people are now starting to truly understand the scale of risk			0
businesses have buckets of chlorine at the doorstep , people wear gloves and have stopped shaking hands			0
the population is not yet panicking though			0
the people of @entity2 have been through many challenges over the years , from war to cholera , and they remain resolute			1
there 's no doubt that it 's going to be an intense and exhausting next few months for medical staff as the outbreak continues			1
but , after some initial nerves , they are working together , gaining experience and confidence to help @entity2 to fight its latest , life - threatening challenge .			2

two days ago one of @entity2 's leading doctors died after contracting @entity15
dr. @entity179 of @entity180 went to @entity2 before the outbreak
his team has now become part of the response effort , but he says staff faced a *dilemma*
@entity2 's health system was struggling before the outbreak and lives are at stake
