-- technology keeps bringing us closer to a world where people can communicate freely across language barriers			2
@entity6 on tuesday announced that its e-mail service , @entity8 , soon will include an " automatic translation " feature for all users			1
" the next time you receive a message in a language other than your own , just click on translate message in the header at the top of the message , " the company writes in a blog post , " and it will be instantly translated into your language			1
" the update will roll out in the next few days			1
the announcement comes on the heels of another language - related news blip from the @entity27 , @entity28 , company			2
@entity6 said last week that its @entity31 service -- which changes text from one language to another -- handles as much translation work in a day as human translators could manage in a year			2
" in a given day we translate roughly as much text as you 'd find in 1 million books , " the company said			1
that is , of course , pretty incredible			2
but all of this translation talk is also generating discussion about the weaknesses of current computer - translation technology			2
writing for the @entity47 , anthropologist @entity46 bemoans the fact that so many languages are n't represented by @entity6			1
" since its inception in 2006 , @entity6 has added 65 languages from areas extending across much of the world , though two exceptions stand out : @entity56 and @entity57 , " she writes			1
" no languages from @entity56 -- such as @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 -- make the @entity6 cut			1
neither do the @entity65 languages @entity66 , @entity67 , or @entity68			1
the sole inclusions from @entity57 are swahili and @entity70			0
" furthermore , accuracy is always a nagging and unavoidable topic of discussion when it comes to @entity76 translation services			0
like many people , i use @entity31 as a starting point for translation , but do n't necessarily trust that it will get everything right			0
it 's great for getting the gist of a news story that 's published in @entity86 or @entity87 , but if i need to write a formal letter to someone in one of those languages , i 'd get human help			1
@entity6 acknowledges as much on a web page about translate : " when @entity31 generates a translation , it looks for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents to help decide on the best translation for you			2
by detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators , @entity31 can make intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should be			0
" this process of seeking patterns in large amounts of text is called ' statistical machine translation			0
' since the translations are generated by machines , not all translation will be perfect			0
the more human - translated documents that @entity31 can analyze in a specific language , the better the translation quality will be			0
this is why translation accuracy will sometimes vary across languages			2
" as for its auto - translation e-mail service , @entity6 says this will be a jump forward for an increasingly globalized workforce			0
and if you speak other languages fluently , you can notify @entity6 so translations in those languages wo n't show up automatically			1
@entity6 just " graduated " the feature from its @entity128 , a sort of sandbox for innovative features the company makes available to users on an a la carte basis			1
the change this week is that auto - translation now will automatically show up as a feature for everyone on @entity8			1
" we heard immediately from @entity139 for @entity141 users that this was a killer feature for working with local teams across the world , " the company says			1
" some people just wanted to easily read newsletters from abroad			0
another person wrote in telling us how he set up his mom 's @entity8 to translate everything into her native language , thus saving countless explanatory phone calls ( he thanked us profusely )			1
i continue to use it to participate in discussions with the global @entity6 offices i often visit			0
" here 's how @entity156 , a distinguished research scientist at @entity6 , sees the present state and future of machine translation online			0
he wrote this blurb on the sixth anniversary of @entity31 , which recently passed : " we imagine a future where anyone in the world can consume and share any information , no matter what language it 's in , and no matter where it pops up			0
we already provide translation for web pages on the fly as you browse in @entity178 , text in mobile photos , @entity172 video captions , and speech - to - speech ' conversation mode ' on smartphones			0
we want to knock down the language barrier wherever it trips people up , and we ca n't wait to see what the next six years will bring			0

@entity8 adds a feature that can translate emails between languages
the update is rolling out in coming days
users can turn off the feature if they speak other languages
