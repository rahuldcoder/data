-- much like buses coming in twos and threes , @entity1 found itself sunday in the unprecedented position of having not just one but two cyclists on the 2012 @entity8 podium			1
against the backdrop of the @entity10 and resplendent in yellow -- the jersey that denotes the @entity8 winner -- @entity14 will deservedly take the plaudits for becoming the first @entity16 to win the most prestigious cycling race in the world			1
but the presence of second - placed @entity20 is testament to an organizational effort that has ensured @entity22 has steamrollered its way past all the opposition			1
@entity25 claimed his second stage win on the @entity8 as he sealed his overall victory saturday in an individual time trial			1
@entity20 also won a mountain stage and forged his reputation as a @entity8 winner in his own right in the near future			1
while their teammate @entity35 sprinted to victory on the final stage in @entity39 for his third stage victory and 23rd overall on the @entity8 as @entity22 's domination was complete			1
@entity25 seals @entity8 triumph in @entity39 how times have changed since @entity46 @entity45 was racing on the roads of @entity48			1
" there has n't been a @entity53 winner before because there was no investment in road cycling up until now , " @entity45 , who was crowned @entity49 and finished fourth in the @entity50 , told @entity0			1
" if you wanted to be a pro rider before it was largely an individual process			2
there was n't any back up and very little encouragement from those running the sport			2
it 's only lately it has changed , due to the arrival of government money and sponsorship deals			2
" when @entity45 first turned professional with the @entity48 team @entity69 in 1980 , it was during an era when aspiring @entity1 riders had to brave the @entity73 amateur scene to achieve their dream			1
government funding it is a different story today			2
off the back of growing success on the track , including a 14 - medal haul at the @entity82 , @entity1 cycling now receives over $ 40 million of government funding			1
" we invest in @entity88 sports with money from @entity92 and government along ' no compromise ' principles , " explained a @entity85 spokesman , " rewarding success and potential success for the next @entity88			2
" the sports basically get all funding except commercial deals from us			2
" for @entity1 road cycling , the breakthrough moment came in 2009 when @entity22 was founded , the country 's only professional cycling outfit			1
spearheaded by @entity102 , a driving force behind @entity53 's eight gold medals in @entity105 , @entity22 has produced @entity1 's first @entity8 winner in only its third attempt at the race			1
" when i raced you had to figure out most things for yourself , " @entity45 , who raced between 1980 and 1995 , explained			2
" you received advice from friends and colleagues but the back - up was nothing like @entity14 has to call upon			1
" types of training , the whens , hows and whys , diet , dealing with your psychology , they were all subjects you had to untangle yourself			2
it 's taken them a while to understand all those aspects and come up with a plan			0
" cycling immortality despite his hardships , @entity45 can take comfort in the fact his struggles paved the way for @entity25 to earn cycling immortality			2
" when i started racing i looked at what had been achieved before by @entity53 riders and put that as one of my targets , " said @entity45			0
" you can only hope that inspires others to go further than you did			0
" i know how much work it took , how much it hurt sometimes and if someone comes along and beats that then i can have nothing but respect for them			0
there are no easy answers it comes down to hard work , commitment , sacrifices and talent			0
" whilst @entity25 , @entity20 and @entity35 may be making all the headlines for @entity22 at the moment , there is another @entity16 content to take a backseat role -- for the meantime at least			1
@entity163 will be competing in his first @entity8 in @entity164 next month , and is keen to match the success of his elder compatriots			1
" my ambition is to emulate @entity25 and to emulate what he has achieved -- i feel i 'm capable of achieving that too			0
" " having those other @entity16 around me is a big help and inspiration			0
@entity25 went through the same system that i am in , and he 's proven that success is possible			0
there 's no reason that i ca n't do that when i 'm his age			0
" @entity181 ' 2012 challenge was aided by the absence of two cycling superstars			2
the 2010 champion @entity184 missed this year 's race with a broken pelvis , while @entity164 's @entity187 is still serving a ban for doping offenses			0
doping problems doping has cast a long shadow over cycling throughout the history of the sport , with @entity184 's brother @entity196 failing an in - @entity8 test earlier this week , but the ever forthright @entity45 denied it was an excuse for @entity1 riders past failings			1
" i do n't consider the doping aspect to be a factor , it 's a cop - out for those happy with being the big fish in a small pond or even a small fish in that pond			0
" it is easy to hide behind the excuse that everyone is doping so it 's not worth doing but the reality is there has n't been enough investment or the people with the talent and commitment to make the top level on the road			0
" @entity163 was keen to stress that @entity22 wear their cleanliness as a badge of honor			1
" if there 's one thing in our team it 's a clean philosophy			0
it 's an even stronger testament to @entity25 ' ability that he 's done all this clean			0
" @entity237 has some of the most tested athletes on the planet and our team 's ethics are unrivaled			0
@entity25 and @entity20 have put all these riders to shame both on and off the bike			1
" so what has @entity25 got which previous @entity1 challengers have lacked ? and what has gone into transforming him from track speedster to road racing extraordinaire ? @entity45 believes @entity25 ' switch to the @entity250 @entity249 team was key point on his path to greatness			1
" only when he went to @entity249 did he take steps forward with his road career , " @entity45 said of the 32 - year - old			0
key switch " probably due to a mix of the @entity48 teams he was at previously not asking the right questions of him talent wise and @entity14 's own contentment with being just a pursuiter who could win short time trials and prologues			1
" tactically , @entity22 were impeccable throughout the three - week marathon			1
ably assisted by @entity20 and sprint star @entity35 , @entity25 was consistently in the right place at exactly the right time			1
" it 's been more about how @entity22 as a team have been above everyone else , " added @entity45			1
" that limits possibilities to challenge when they are riding so fast			0
" they 've put their general classification riders in the best positions by controlling the race and then @entity25 and @entity20 have performed better than the other challengers in the time trials			1
" the support role adopted by @entity20 and @entity35 is a vital one , and not one to be undermined , as @entity163 testifies to , " with cycling you have days when you go for the results and you have days when you know it does n't suit your ability , so you help the team as much as you can			1
" cycling , essentially , is all about pushing the air out of the way			2
if you have a chain of guys in front of you you barely have to pedal at all			0
it can keep you fresh -- and keep you out of crashes , too			0
" after finishing a then @entity1 - best fourth in the @entity50 , what does @entity45 think he could have achieved under the tutelage of the meticulous @entity301 and with a ruthless team like @entity22 at his back ? different times " who knows , " he replied			1
" these are different times with different riders , sometimes i raced too much and usually there were never enough rest periods			0
it was difficult to prepare well because the thinking used to be one race after another			0
" it 's like trying to compare eras and champions			0
the best riders of each era are at the top because of the talent , commitment , intelligence and suffering they cope with			0
" regardless of his teammates ' performances and the peerless tactical guidance he has received , @entity25 ' win in a race many professionals struggle to finish should not be belittled			0
" it takes commitment to be a professional cyclist and the @entity8 will push you to your absolute limits , " insisted @entity45			2
" if you do well it 's a fantastic feeling and it makes the tiredness and mental fatigue justifiable			0
it 's only later you fully realize what 's happened when you 've had a bit of time to reflect , if you 've achieved something that 'll go down in history then you can be happy with yourself			0
" then you start planning for the next step , improving , making sure you are staying at that level everyone else is aiming for			0
" @entity45 spoke to @entity346 on behalf of the cycling charity @entity347			2
