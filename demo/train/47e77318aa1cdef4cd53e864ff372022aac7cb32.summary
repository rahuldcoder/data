@entity3 president @entity1 's three day cross country trip , designed to build support for his economic priorities ahead of his @entity7 speech , is being sidelined by the terror attacks in @entity9			1
mr. @entity1 held an unscheduled photo op in the @entity11 before leaving @entity12 on wednesday to address the attacks			1
and aboard @entity22 on his flight to @entity24 , @entity21 press secretary @entity20 was peppered with questions like , " with respect to the situation in @entity9 , does the @entity14 have an assessment ... on who these gunmen were ? " and , " at this point , you ca n't say whether these gunmen were linked to any terror organization ? " and , "			1
. is the @entity14 concerned about any risk here from this group ? " the economy only came up later			2
@entity20 even made a rare second appearance in the press section of @entity22 to advise reporters that the president had called @entity39 president @entity38 aboard the flight			2
but despite the focus on @entity9 from much of the national media , once the president arrived in @entity24 and @entity3 , he stuck to his message that his policies are responsible for the rebounding @entity14 economy and the resurgence of growth in @entity14 manufacturing jobs			1
in @entity3 thursday , he made an unscheduled stop at a housing development where new homes were being built to highlight the uptick in housing prices			0
and at a speech at the city 's @entity56 , he focused on that comeback , and steps he is taking to make sure it continues			1
with hud secretary @entity62 by his side , the president even announced a half percent cut in @entity66 mortgage loan rates to help families			0
and he said his administration 's policies are responsible for the economic turnaround			2
" as a result of all these efforts , today home sales are up 50 percent			0
" he said as a result of homes sales coming back , more than a hundred thousand construction jobs have been created and added , " this progress is not an accident			0
it 's what happens when you have policies that put middle class families first			0
" however , several reporters from different networks were still emailing the press secretary late thursday morning to ask if the president would address the @entity39 terror crisis in his remarks			0
at an event with 750 autoworkers at a @entity94 manufacturing plant in @entity95 , @entity96 , on wednesday the president said , " there is no doubt , thanks to the steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and to rebuild it on a new foundation , we are entering into the @entity104 with new confidence that @entity14 is coming back			0
" the president added : " that 's going to be the focus of my @entity7 in a couple of weeks -- building on the progress that we 've already made			1
" perhaps friday will be a breakthrough day , as he heads to @entity111 , @entity112 , to talk about expanding higher education opportunities for millions of students			0
he still has two weeks before the @entity7 to make his sales pitch to @entity14 and then directly to the new @entity116 led @entity117 .			1

@entity1 is pushing economic priorities ahead of @entity7 speech
but most media attention is on @entity9 attack
