@entity0 -- a commission set up to assess national security measures on tuesday gave the @entity5 government a failing grade in improving response time to a biological attack			1
" nearly a decade after september 11 , 2001 , one year after our original report , and one month after the christmas day bombing attempt , the @entity5 is failing to address several urgent threats , especially bioterrorism , " said former sen. @entity9 , chairman of the commission			1
" @entity15 of the last three administrations has been slow to recognize and respond to the biothreat			0
but we no longer have the luxury of a slow learning curve , when we know @entity21 is interested in bioweapons , " @entity9 said			0
" the assessment is not a good one , particularly in the area of biological threats , " the report by the @entity24 on the @entity25 and @entity26 said			1
" while the government has made progress on preventing such attacks , it is simply not paying consistent and urgent attention to the means of responding quickly and effectively so that they no longer constitute a threat of mass destruction , " the report said			2
the government barely got a passing grade on oversight of high - containment laboratories			1
the commission , headed by @entity9 , a former @entity46 senator from @entity47 , and @entity48 , @entity49 , also gave the government failing grades in congressional oversight and in producing the next generation of security experts			1
read the report card ( @entity55 ) the delayed response to the h1n1 influenza outbreak demonstrated the @entity5 was " woefully behind " in its ability to produce needed vaccinations and treatments rapidly , the commission said			1
" @entity63 came with months of warning , " the commission 's report said			2
" but even with time to prepare , the epidemic peaked before most @entity5 had access to vaccine			2
a bioattack will come with no such warning			0
" the commission was set up after @entity71 passed a bill in 2007 to implement recommendations of the @entity24			0
the commission submitted its report with new recommendations in december 2008 , predicting that terrorists would use a weapon of mass destruction -- likely biological -- by 2013 unless the global community quickly launched a forceful strategy to prevent it			1
the report card released tuesday is a follow - up to that report , called " @entity84			2
" @entity71 took its lumps in the report as well , especially on its oversight of national security issues			1
" @entity71 has failed to take even the relatively easy first steps to consolidate oversight authority of the @entity92 , " the commission said			2
" the estimated number of committees and subcommittees that oversee @entity92 ranges from 82 to 108			0
virtually no progress has been made since consolidation was first recommended by the @entity24 in 2004			0
" both @entity71 and the administration were faulted for not funding recruitment and training programs for national security experts			1
the government got an " incomplete " for its work on implementing a comprehensive nuclear policy toward @entity105 -- meaning that not enough time had elapsed to give a grade			0
other areas in nuclear proliferation , including working with @entity110 , got middle - of - the - road grades			2
" president @entity113 has undertaken substantial effort to bolster the nonproliferation regime , " the commission said			0
" from his april 2009 speech in @entity117 to his chairmanship of a @entity121 @entity120 meeting on the subject and plans for a @entity123 , he is attempting to bend current trend lines			0
" but the commission said that it has concerns " regarding the administration 's failure to prevent the lapse of verification mechanisms established under the [ @entity130 ]			0
ensuring their continuation was very important and insufficient attention was paid to it			0
" the commission handed out " a " grades for integration of the @entity138 and @entity92 councils , designation of a senior adviser for @entity142 proliferation and terrorism , and development of a national strategy for bioforensics .			1

nation ill - prepared for biological attack , commission report says
congressional oversight process too *cumbersome* , report finds
@entity5 failing to produce new generation of security experts , according to report
integration of councils , naming of @entity142 adviser earn better grades
