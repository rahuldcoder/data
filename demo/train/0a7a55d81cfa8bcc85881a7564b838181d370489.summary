it 's the white whale of the skies and one of aviation 's rarest and most loved planes currently in service			2
the @entity7 , popularly known as the " @entity7 " because of its resemblance to the white @entity11 whale , is the @entity13 plane manufacturer 's super-sized transporter jet			1
five of these enormous planes make more than 60 flights each week , carrying parts for all of @entity19 ' planes from manufacturing sites -- wings in the @entity22 , tails in @entity24 , for example -- to the final assembly facilities in either @entity27 , @entity28 or @entity29			1
the planes have been in service since 1994 , but are in need of reinforcements			2
since the plane 's inaugural flight , @entity19 's production rates have increased five fold , so a new fleet is planned to keep up with demand , especially with the new @entity41 plane now entering service			1
" the need for the new @entity7 comes with the increase in production rates and to get extra capacity on top of this fleet of five aircrafts , " says @entity43 , head of @entity44			1
" so initially there will be a mixed fleet use of both new @entity7 and old @entity7			1
and then the second need was as well to anticipate replacement of an aging fleet			2
" a crew of three operates the @entity7 : two pilots and a loadmaster			1
because of its size the plane reacts differently to other large jets in turbulence ; moving sideways more than up and down			0

the top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional , wider fuselage section -- resembling a bubble -- was added to the airframe , giving it its characteristic hump			0
the cockpit was lowered , making it possible for the cargo hold to be loaded and unloaded through the front of the aircraft			0
the result is an incredibly spacious cargo hold of 1,400 cubic meters			0
that 's the equivalent to 671 people , 36 cars or seven elephants			0
" the perception you have ( when the cargo door opens ) is of a huge volume like a cathedral , " says @entity43			0
although the @entity7 's maximum payload of 47 tons is surpassed by a handful of other cargo aircraft , its voluminous hold makes it suitable for transporting oversized , but not particularly heavy , cargo , like aircraft parts			1

but it 's not large enough to transport many @entity111 super jumbo parts			2
those need to travel by boat , barge and road			0
with the @entity68 now out of service , the new @entity65 will be based on the @entity117 and be bigger than the existing fleet			2
while the current planes can only carry one wing for the new @entity41 at a time , the new jet will be able to take on board both on the same flight			0
and for plane - spotters who love the unique shape of the existing @entity7 , that will remain much the same			1
" it will be the same look , " says @entity43 , " because we will operate both fleets in parallel for a number of years and it will also be compatible with existing loading means			0
" the first of the new fleet will enter service in 2020			1
watch : first flight of @entity139 ' @entity41 aviation writer @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

@entity19 ' fleet of five @entity7 super transporters has been in service for over 20 years
new model of @entity7 planned to enter service in 2020
new plane will be even larger and able to transport two a350 wings on same flight
