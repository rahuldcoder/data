men wanted to be him			0
seven decades before @entity5 , a world away from @entity7 and @entity8 , a predecessor to @entity9 and @entity10 and a formidable striker who could have rivaled @entity12			0
that man was @entity14 , a soccer superstar in the days before @entity15 ruled the " beautiful game			1
" he was a larger than life playboy who abandoned a legal career to become his country 's finest footballer			0
and before the @entity21 -- @entity15 's iconic stadium in @entity23 -- was built , @entity14 was the city 's star attraction with a " @entity29 " personality which saw him flit from outrageous charmer to disruptive egoist			1
" sometimes he was a gentleman , other times you could n't stand him , " explains @entity30 , author of " there was never a man like @entity14			2
" " like the book by @entity38 , he was a doctor and a monster , " @entity30 told @entity0			0
@entity14 is best remembered for his nine - year spell with @entity23 club @entity41 , scoring over 200 goals for the team between 1939 and 1948 to become one of @entity46 's most feared strikers			1
blog : can anyone stop @entity49 at @entity50 ? but his career , much like his life , was tinged with tragedy , as circumstance and his ability to press the self - destruct button prevented him from capturing any significant silverware as a player			2
" he grew up knowing he wanted to be a football player , " says @entity30			0
" when he moved from @entity60 to @entity23 he marveled at beach football and @entity41 ... his will became an obsession			1
" an affluent background had afforded @entity14 the opportunity to train as a lawyer , but the courtroom could not contain his football talent or his vibrant personality			2
@entity70 : racism in football " he had a big ego and his soul craved the screams of thousands of football supporters , " @entity30 says			0
" he loved his star status , being an international idol , playing for his national team and being desired by women and admired by men			0
" he thought his fame would be eternal			0
he believed he would be @entity14 forever			2
" arguably @entity14 's crowning moment -- @entity15 's crowning moment -- should have come at the 1950 @entity50			1
it was the first time @entity15 had hosted the tournament -- next year the @entity50 returns to the @entity46 nation for a second time -- and it was an opportunity for the country to announce itself as a global power , both on and off the pitch			1
with the grandest of stages -- the @entity21 -- constructed , @entity14 's public awaited			1
but when 200,000 @entity97 packed into the stadium for an agonizing defeat to @entity100 in the tournament 's final match , @entity14 was nowhere to be seen			1
" because of @entity103 , @entity14 missed out on the @entity104 of 1942 and 1946 , " explained @entity30			1
" the 1950 @entity50 was his last chance , given his physical and technical peak			1
" in 1949 @entity14 was playing for @entity108 , having spent the previous year living the high life in @entity110 with @entity111 -- with his spell in @entity113 rumored to have even included a fling with @entity110 's then @entity115 , @entity116			2
@entity14 's coach at @entity108 was @entity118 , who was also in charge of the @entity15 national team			1
but @entity118 criticized the attitude of his combustible star and @entity14 's response was typically trigger happy			2
he pointed a gun to @entity118 's head and pulled the trigger			2
the gun was n't loaded , but that action was enough to kill @entity14 's dreams of playing in the @entity50			1
@entity108 won the @entity130 , but by now @entity14 was an outcast			2
when @entity15 was left heartbroken by a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity100 which destroyed its @entity50 dreams , @entity14 was playing in @entity135 's lucrative illegal leagues			1
" for the fans , @entity15 lost the @entity50 because they did n't have @entity14 , " says @entity30			1
" @entity15 feared a valiant @entity100			2
with @entity14 , it would n't be like this			0
he did n't fear anyone or anything			0
" they say that , in 1951 , @entity14 used to say he could have saved @entity15 , " says @entity141 , director of the biographical film " @entity14 , " which was released in 2011			1
by the time @entity15 , led by the precocious talents of @entity12 and @entity146 , finally won the @entity50 for the first time in @entity148 in 1958 , @entity14 was hurtling towards an early grave			1
" @entity14 became a walking bomb ready to explode			0
syphilis and drugs just amplified his self - destruction , " @entity30 says			0
" he had a good upbringing , he was elegant , educated and from a good family			0
he could have enjoyed a career as a lawyer or diplomat -- instead he suffered a pathetic death in a mental institution			0
" @entity14 died on november 8 , 1959 , aged just 39			1
" he was a victim of his refusal to be treated for syphilis and if untreated it affects the brain , " @entity141 told @entity0			0
" he suffered a lot			0
to see a photo of him when he died is amazing , he looked 70 years old			0
" could @entity14 , free from disease and drug addiction , have carved out a legacy as formidable as @entity12 , who is widely regarded as the greatest player who has ever lived ? " @entity12 is one of a kind , like @entity172 , @entity173 and surfer @entity174 are , " says @entity30			2
" but @entity14 would be more recognized worldwide			0
maybe at the level of a @entity9 , @entity176 and @entity8			0
" for @entity15 , much like the tale of the 1950 @entity50 final , @entity14 's story is one of what might have been .			1
