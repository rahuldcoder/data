-- will it be a " @entity2 " night -- or a " true " one ? the 66th @entity3 will be handed out monday night , and what was expected to be a coronation honoring the final season of @entity7 's " @entity2 " has emerged as something a little more competitive , thanks to @entity11 's " true detective , " the moody crime series starring @entity13 and @entity14			1
though " @entity2 " still has a decided edge for best drama series -- the handicappers at @entity19 , for example , are unanimous in their support of the @entity22 - led show -- the onrush of @entity13 love earlier this year , when the actor was hailed for his performances in " @entity26 , " " @entity30 of @entity31 " and an @entity33 - winning turn in " @entity34 , " may turn the tide in favor of " detective			1
" it certainly received a good start			1
at the @entity36 , which were given out august 16 , " detective " won four awards , including trophies for its cinematography and casting			1
" @entity2 " won just one , for its editing			1
@entity11 , ' snl , ' ' @entity47 ' win @entity36 here are some things to watch for as tv gets ready for its biggest night : 1			1
all right , all right , all right , b * tch			2
" @entity2 " finished its run with acclaim as one of the best shows in tv history			1
even the @entity58 liked the finale -- and the @entity58 does n't like anything			2
certainly that will be enough to earn it best drama , right ? but watch out for " true detective			1
" even if " @entity2 " wins best drama , " detective " might take other major categories			1
for all the praise he 's received , @entity22 has come up empty for best actor the last two years , losing to @entity70 ( " @entity71 " ) last year and @entity72 ( " homeland " ) in 2012			2
this time he 's facing both @entity13 and @entity14 , not to mention @entity70 , perennial bridesmaid @entity74 ( " @entity76 " ) and the wily @entity75 ( " @entity77 " )			1
and what about " @entity79 " ? sure , the series got stiffed in the lead acting categories , but it 's up in supporting slots -- for @entity84 and @entity85 -- as well as best drama			1
moreover , it led all programs with 19 nominations			2
moreover , they " would do things for their family you could n't imagine			2
" emmy nominations 2014 : complete list 2			2
living is easy , comedy is hard			1
the comedy categories are incredibly competitive this year			1
last year 's winner , " @entity100 , " is nominated once again , but this time there 's a sense that it 's ripe for a fall			2
" any ( of the other nominees ) would be better than yet another win for ' @entity100 , ' " wrote @entity104 's @entity103 and @entity105			2
but what will take its place ? " @entity113 , " @entity111 's most popular show , could notch a win			0
so could " @entity114 , " which has the benefit of last year 's lead actress winner , @entity116			0
and , lurking in the corner , there 's " @entity124 , " which finished perhaps its most talked - about season -- one that had audiences wondering if they were , indeed , actually watching a comedy			1
the performers ' trophies are even more uncertain			0
will best comedy actor go to " @entity129 's " @entity128 again -- he 's won three of the last five -- or @entity132 ? will best comedy actress go to @entity134 , " @entity135 's " @entity136 or " @entity47 's " @entity137 ? can @entity138 , who won an @entity139 at the @entity141 event for her guest spot in " @entity143 , " win another for " @entity145 " ? it 's enough to make you long for the certainty of " @entity135 's " @entity149 ( @entity150 ) -- who 's not , incidentally , up for an @entity139			1
not that he would sweat over it			0
the famed comedian and actor , who died august 11 , will be remembered during the " @entity158 " section in a tribute presented by @entity157			1
regardless of how tasteful , thoughtful or warmhearted the segment is , you can bet that someone will complain about it			0
" race " for the top			0
@entity166 , there was essentially no competition in the reality - competition category : the winner was almost always " @entity170			0
" the popular series -- part travelogue , part game , all fun -- won nine out of 10 years from 2003 to 2012 , except for 2010 , when " top chef " took the title			0
but last year " @entity177 " took home the trophy , and the battle is n't getting any easier			0
" @entity177 " is up again , so is " top chef , " and the other nominees include " @entity182 , " " @entity183 " and " @entity184			0
this is the first time the " @entity190 " host and former " snl " newsman is hosting the @entity36 , and no doubt some critics will have their knives out			0
@entity186 admits he 's nervous			0
" i think it would be weird if there were no nerves , " he said			0
" it 's a big undertaking and you want to make sure you treat it with the proper respect , and i think nerves constantly remind you to do that			0
" he 's certainly hoping to do a good job , and he emphasizes : he will not sing			0
" i ca n't ! i wish i could ! " he said			0
do it well , @entity186 , and maybe you 'll get a shot			0
the emmys will air monday on @entity208			1
the show begins at 8 p.m. et and airs from @entity211 ' @entity210 .			0
