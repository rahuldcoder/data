@entity0 , @entity1 -- demonstrators clapped along to @entity5 - era songs as dancers from @entity9 's @entity8 fleet entertained the masses at the center of @entity13 's administrative capital sunday			1
but it was more than just nostalgia for the old @entity5			0
with a controversial referendum over whether @entity13 will remain part of @entity1 just a week away , it was a rallying cry for ethnic @entity9 gathered in @entity0 's @entity19			1
the large demonstration was the latest flashpoint as tensions simmer on the @entity13 peninsula , which has become the epicenter of a battle for influence among @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29 since @entity1 president @entity31 's ouster last month			1
pro-russian forces have pushed into the @entity8 peninsula in a bloodless siege , prompting criticism from @entity37 nations and @entity1 's interim government			1
at sunday 's rally , throngs of people waved @entity13 and @entity9 flags			2
and they said they want one thing : a union with @entity9			0
because of language and history , one man at the rally told @entity2 , @entity9 and @entity13 are already " brothers			1
" but not all @entity52 are convinced			0
across town , beneath a statue of @entity1 's most celebrated poet , the crowd was much smaller , the mood much more somber			2
asked what he thought about the possibility of @entity13 becoming part of @entity9 , one demonstrator shook his head			2
" it will be very complicated because of economics , and a lot of different nations live here , not only @entity9			0
... not all of the people want to be part of @entity9 , " he said			0
" it 's kind of show			0
" the rally was peaceful			0
but elsewhere , in the @entity13 port of @entity77 , another @entity1 rally came under attack by @entity80 gangs who whipped and beat demonstrators			1
in @entity28 , thousands of people gathered at a rally for peace at the central @entity86 , the cradle of the protests that ousted @entity31			0
the crowd shouted slogans such as " @entity91 " and " @entity73 go away " as representatives of different religions prayed for a solution to the crisis			2
@entity73 speaks with @entity96 , @entity97 while the autonomous @entity1 region was the scene of emotional demonstrations by both sides , @entity9 president @entity73 defended the breakaway moves by the @entity80 leaders of @entity13 in conversations with two world leaders on sunday , in separate phone calls with @entity107 chancellor @entity96 and @entity108 prime minister @entity97 , @entity73 underlined " steps being taken by @entity13 's legitimate authorities ... being based on international law on behalf of the interests of the population there , " according to a @entity110 statement			1
@entity73 also said new @entity1 authorities were doing nothing " to curb ultra-nationalist and radical forces committing outrages " in @entity28 and other regions			1
the three leaders spoke amid tensions on the @entity8 peninsula that have escalated since the @entity27 - backed regional parliament voted to leave @entity1 for @entity9 and announced a march 16 referendum to give @entity52 an opportunity to vote on the idea			2
despite the differences of opinion over what is happening on the ground , the @entity110 statement said there was consensus on the need to de-escalate tensions and normalize the situation			0
it 's unclear what could happen next in the tense standoff , but sunday 's phone conversations between @entity73 , @entity97 and @entity96 send one clear message , @entity2 analyst and @entity9 journalist @entity144 said			1
" i think it shows that president @entity73 is very worried by the situation			1
i think speculation that he 's trying to rebuild the @entity5 empire are way off base , " @entity144 said			0
" i think he knows all too well the necessity of @entity9 having an international relationship with the @entity29			0
... my hope is , with all the escalations going on , that there 's a real chance of finding some way out of this very dangerous situation			0
" @entity27 has denounced the events that led to @entity31 's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new @entity1 authorities , putting the two countries on a collision course over control of @entity13 , which has longstanding ties to @entity9 and has thousands of @entity9 troops stationed there			1
@entity73 has said @entity9 has the right to protect @entity9 living in the former @entity5 republic			2
pro-russian forces are now in de facto control of the region ahead of the referendum , which @entity28 says is illegal			0
@entity175 has warned @entity27 that any moves to annex @entity13 would close the door to diplomacy			2
on saturday , @entity180 president @entity179 rounded up world leaders to demand @entity9 " de-escalate the situation			1
" @entity1 interim prime minister @entity183 will fly to the @entity180 this week to discuss the crisis in @entity13 , as hostilities in the eastern @entity188 country 's southern region intensify			1
@entity183 is expected to arrive in the @entity180 on wednesday , a spokeswoman from his press office told @entity2			1
the @entity191 confirmed the visit and said the two will talk about the @entity9 military incursion and economic support for @entity1			2
referendum becomes focus @entity73 last week secured permission from his parliament to use military force to protect @entity9 citizens in @entity1			1
the move came within days after @entity31 's flight from the country			0
@entity31 was ousted after three months of protests against a decision to spurn a free trade deal with the @entity208 and turn toward closer ties with @entity27			0
a convoy of military vehicles , believed to be carrying @entity9 soldiers , traveled through @entity0 on saturday , heading toward the border post at @entity216 , a spokesman for the @entity211 told @entity2			2
@entity216 is one of the main access points into @entity13 from the rest of @entity1			1
dozens of military observers from the @entity222 have tried to cross into @entity13 for three days but have been refused entry by armed men			2
they did not attempt a crossing on sunday			0
the referendum on whether the @entity13 should join @entity9 has become the focus of the @entity1 crisis			1
@entity183 has called it " an illegitimate decision			0
" " if there is an annexation of @entity13 , if there is a referendum that moves @entity13 from @entity1 to @entity9 , we wo n't recognize it , nor will most of the world , " @entity180 deputy national security adviser @entity236 said on @entity2 's " @entity237 " on sunday			1
" so i think you 'd see , if there are further steps in the direction of annexing @entity13 , a very strong , coordinated international response			0
