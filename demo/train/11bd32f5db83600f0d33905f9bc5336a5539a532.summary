-- for those who did n't know much about @entity2 , her passing this week revealed two surprises			1
first , that her post-hollywood career was dominated by public service			0
she ran ( unsuccessfully ) for @entity8 in 1967 , served as a representative to the @entity10 and was ambassador to @entity12 and @entity13			0
and second , she was a @entity14			0
she was that rarest of things nowadays : a @entity17 star who admitted to voting for the @entity14			1
today , @entity17 appears uniformly liberal			1
but once upon a time , things were different			0
while researching my forthcoming book on @entity17 and politics , i was surprised to discover how many vocal conservatives there were in @entity17 well into the 1970s - and that many of them enjoyed the company of @entity27			1
@entity28 narrated a @entity27 biographical documentary at the 1972 @entity14 convention , where @entity31 was a highly visible guest			0
@entity32 toured the country with @entity34 and country pop star @entity35 to drum up support for the troops in @entity38			0
@entity39 closed his 1970 christmas tv special with a plea for viewers to get behind the president			2
@entity44 once told reporters , " all you have to do is go to @entity38 to see that the kids are still patriotic , " and suggested that antiwar @entity17 actors were just eaten up with bitterness at @entity27 's popularity			1
yet in 21st century @entity52 , the only public @entity17 support @entity14 can get ( look at @entity54 's pitiful donations ) tends to come from faded action heroes like @entity56 and @entity57			1
yes , @entity31 is still a fan of the @entity14 , as is @entity58 , and @entity59 is close to the @entity61 family			0
but the acting contingent of conservatism has shrunk			2
the reason is recent political dynamics			2
@entity17 has moved to the left ; the @entity14 have moved to the right			1
when @entity2 was a child star , @entity17 was dominated by powerful @entity14 moguls			1
the movies she tap danced and sang through for @entity70 might have earned the praise of @entity72 ( he once said , " it is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents an @entity52 can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles " ) , but the industry that produced them was anti-union , anti-communist , and typically anti-democrat			1
there was , for example , near unanimity between the otherwise inharmonious studio chiefs in opposing @entity86 's 1934 ultra-liberal campaign for governor of @entity88			2
( @entity86 wanted to introduce a graduated income tax			0
) the moguls actually made their staff donate a week 's salary to @entity86 's @entity14 opponent			2
but the moguls lost their power when the studios were undone by trust - busting and tv			2
in the 1960s , a new generation of stars defined themselves artistically by their revolt against the studio machine and " square " middle - @entity52 culture			1
these were the beautiful people like @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
they began as political outsiders , but their activism slowly professionalized and grew into pacs that raised millions of dollars for almost exclusively @entity113 campaigns			0
men like @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 became the new kingmakers			0
in one month of the 2012 election season , @entity115 and @entity116 each gave $ 1 million to president @entity121 's super @entity120			2
@entity17 money is an indispensable part of the modern @entity113 machine			2
of course , movie makers might consider themselves socially progressive , but , as their disposable income attests , they are still ambitious capitalists -- ones that might have remained more open to the @entity14 if it had only stuck to its old theme of limited , small tax government			0
but the @entity14 viscerally repelled the new @entity17 with its social conservatism			1
the actor @entity132 's election as president ought to have represented the pinnacle of @entity17 conservatism , but , ironically , it actually represented the beginning of its post-nixon decline			1
@entity132 's willingness to reach out to the religious right meant that while he was certainly a product of the movie industry , he had effectively divorced himself from its libertine culture			1
throughout his time in office , his @entity17 support base whittled down to the last surviving members of the @entity2 generation			1
when the @entity150 threw a televised charity function in 1985 , the guests were @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			0
the only real contemporary 80s star was @entity156			0
in other words , as @entity17 moved left and the @entity14 moved right , they passed each other on the political spectrum			1
one wonders whether @entity2 would have felt as comfortable identifying herself with the @entity14 today as she did in the 1960s and 1970s			1
after all , her @entity165 persisted ( she was still campaigning for @entity166 in 1992 ) and , as a child rather than an adult star , she had nothing to lose in terms of @entity17 clout by going public with her conservatism			1
for all those moderate @entity14 ( and , yes , they really do exist ) out there in @entity17 , things are a lot harder			2
if they come out as conservative , they risk never getting invited to any forthcoming benefits @entity179 might be throwing to liberate the @entity180			0
that 's a serious problem , because @entity17 is a business in which who you know is as important as what you know			1
therefore , if stars admit their @entity165 , they risk losing friends , parts and a steady income			0
no wonder so few do it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity198 : @entity2 was @entity52 's sweetheart and a committed conservative
conservatism in @entity17 today is a rarity today
@entity132 , as president , wooed religious right ; @entity17 conservatism declined , he says
he says studios ' political kingmakers now come from the left
