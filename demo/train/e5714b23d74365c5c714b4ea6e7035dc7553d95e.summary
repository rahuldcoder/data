@entity0 -- @entity2 spent the last four months in a detention cell in @entity4			0
after being apprehended by agents from @entity7 in june , the illegal immigrant was just steps away from being deported back to her native @entity8			1
then , this week , suddenly , the cell doors swung open , and the married mother of two @entity12 - born children was sent home to her family			1
@entity2 has been granted a one - year stay of removal ; after the year , she 'll have to go before an immigration judge and plead her case as to why she should be given a green card and allowed to remain in the @entity12 permanently			0
there 's no explanation for what melted @entity7			0
after all , this is n't a touchy - feely agency			1
all @entity7 officials will say is that this was a result of " prosecutorial discretion			0
" but that does n't explain why an agency that , for weeks , did n't return the calls of @entity2 ' lawyer , @entity31 , suddenly became much more accommodating			1
it might have something to do with the call i made this week to an @entity7 representative to ask about the case or the story that the @entity40 - language television network @entity39 - @entity39 did on @entity2 or the fact that @entity4 sen. @entity42 took an interest in the fate of a woman who has resided in @entity46 for nearly 20 years or the fact that , according to @entity31 , there may even be a congressional inquiry into whether @entity2 should have been taken into custody in the first place			0
whatever the reason , it had probably had nothing to do with the facts of the case or the letter of the law			0
@entity2 did n't have either on her side			1
she and her husband , @entity59 , came to the @entity12 illegally in the early 1990s			0
in 1998 , they were discovered and ordered deported , but they defied the removal order and continued living in the @entity12 because she had just given birth to their first daughter			1
several months ago , on the bad advice of another lawyer , the couple went to check on the progress of their green card application and again came to the attention of federal authorities			1
on june 2 , @entity7 raided the family home and arrested @entity2 in front of her two daughters -- ages 12 and 14 -- while her husband was at work			0
authorities have n't arrested the husband , because he 's the only parent left at home to care for the children , who are @entity12 citizens			2
@entity2 was slated for deportation			2
all that stood between her and a one - way flight to @entity88 was some media interest and political pressure			0
oh , and a memo			2
the " @entity94 memo " is a june 17 in - house memorandum ( @entity93 ) from ice director @entity94 to all field office directors , field agents and chief counsel			1
in the document , @entity94 advised the bureaucrats that they " may " exercise discretion and show leniency toward some illegal immigrants by weighing certain factors			2
they include the length of time the person has lived in the @entity12 , whether the person was brought as a child , whether the person is pursuing an education , whether the person has a criminal record , whether the person or immediate relative served in the @entity12 military , whether the person has a spouse , child or parent who is a @entity12 citizen or permanent resident , and other circumstances			0
when he heard about the memo , @entity31 decided to play that card			2
" two days after the @entity94 memo came out , i sent immigration officials at the local @entity7 field office a copy of it in along with a statement explaining all the factors , " @entity31 told me			1
" and i asked them : ' so did you change your policy ? ... so can she be released , right ? ' and they said : ' no , we ca n't do that			1
' " in the past few months , i 've heard from about a dozen immigration attorneys who have likewise tried to use the @entity94 memo to spring clients and likewise struck out			2
as illogical as it sounds , ice field agents whose job it is to apprehend folks who break the rules for entering the @entity12 seem to be themselves breaking a set of rules laid out by their supervisor			0
i have three theories as to what 's going on here : the memorandum was written by @entity94 , or people above him , in a deliberately vague manner to allow local agents to skirt it and continue to rack up deportations ; there is massive insubordination within @entity7 at the local level ; or this was a political stunt intended to con @entity162 into thinking the @entity164 administration is being more compassionate and lenient in deportations when really nothing has changed			1
i asked @entity31 which theory he thought was at work here			0
all three , he said			0
" i think it 's a political stunt intended to fool @entity162 into voting for this administration , " @entity31 said			2
" the whole thing is a farce , at least at the local enforcement level			0
" in less than three years , the administration , eager to show that it is enforcing the immigration laws , has deported more than 1 million people			1
and just this week , in a speech at @entity179 , homeland security secretary @entity177 bragged that her department is poised to set another record for deportations in the just - concluded 2011 fiscal year			0
write this down : the @entity94 memo is n't worth the paper it 's written on			1
latinos should n't be fooled into thinking otherwise , and neither should anyone else			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192			1

an illegal immigrant mother *threatened* with deportation was released
@entity192 says her lawyer cited new administration memo on her *behalf*
he says the memo is n't being enforced and may be a ploy to get @entity205 votes
@entity207 has deported more than a million people since @entity164 took office
