-- officials warned wednesday that the bridge linking the @entity4 cities of @entity5 and @entity6 will likely remain closed thursday morning , promising more delays for @entity9 commuters			1
that work is intended to dampen vibration on the structure			1
vibration may have played a role in causing pieces of the @entity5 - @entity16 to fall tuesday night from the span onto the roadway , resulting in its closure			1
the 73 - year - old bridge spans the @entity21 and carries an average 280,000 vehicles daily , according to the state 's @entity23			1
" right now , we do not have a time when the bridge will potentially open , " said @entity25 , a spokesman for @entity26			1
" the work has to be completed first			2
" once the new steel is in place and the rods have been made tense , at least three hours of testing will be carried out before the bridge will reopen to vehicular traffic , @entity25 said , refusing to speculate on when that might occur			1
" the first thing that i would say to motorists is that you need to be at this point planning other routes over the next day or so , " he said			0
the @entity43 and the @entity44 are scrutinizing the repair plans , he said			2
wednesday 's commute was a horror show for many			2
" my wife actually drives over to the peninsula ; she says it 's taken her two hours to get to work so far and she 's not there yet , " commuter @entity52 told @entity0 affiliate @entity53 as he prepared to board a @entity55 train			1
" i tried to take the @entity58 , " said a woman who identified herself only as @entity57			0
" it was a big mistake			0
" she gave up and wound up taking @entity55			0
" it was back - to - back bumper , there were rows of cars everywhere , " said @entity61 , who lives in @entity62 near the @entity63 , which served as an alternate route for many			2
" it was just horrible			0
" ridership increased on ferries , too , with some people finding a silver lining to the snafu			2
" i have been looking for an opportunity to go across the bay in the ferry , " said @entity76 of @entity6			0
" i 'm sorry the cable parted , but i am glad to get the opportunity			0
" @entity25 said wind gusts of up to 50 mph slowed repair efforts on tuesday , but the winds had diminished by wednesday evening			2
winds increased vibration by the rods that were fatigued and ultimately failed , he said			0
" it was a contributing factor , but not necessarily the only factor , and we are analyzing what the factors are right now , " he said			0
travelers flocked to @entity55 , which ran longer trains and extra trains			1
the rail line was on track to exceed its peak ridership of 405,000 in a single day , said @entity55 spokesman @entity98			0
were you there ? send photos and video " we have called in extra personnel to help us make sure we operate with every available train car we have in order to provide as much capacity as possible , " said @entity55 's assistant general manager of operations , @entity103			0
@entity109 was running a shuttle between the @entity5 and @entity112 stations for @entity114 and @entity115 passengers			1
the pieces that fell -- a cross beam and tie rods -- came from the same section that was repaired in september over @entity120 , when crews worked almost around the clock to fix a crack in the span			0
a 50 - foot section of the bridge collapsed in 1989 during the @entity128 earthquake , killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake - tolerant			1
the whole @entity16 is slated to be replaced in 2013 , said @entity132 , a transportation planner at @entity134 , a national transportation planning firm based in @entity5			1
the bridge is " really showing its age , " he said			0
" it 's kind of a race against time to finish the new bridge before the next quake hits			1

@entity5 - @entity16 closes after parts of it fall to roadway
repair work *ongoing* , but there 's no word when bridge will reopen
travelers flock to *public* transit , *including* trains and ferries
repairs aim to stop vibration , which may have caused the *problem*
