speaking to a visiting @entity3 delegation in @entity0 , prime minister @entity8 told @entity3 deputy prime minister @entity10 that @entity11 was watching the events that have plunged its neighbor , whom he called an important strategic partner to @entity0 , into a political crisis			1
" we 're watching what 's happening in your country			1
it 's an internal affair of @entity3 , though it 's really important to have stability and order there , " he said , according to @entity0 news agency @entity20			1

@entity40 said he was extending his hand to the opposition but warned that he was working from a position of strength : " if we find a fist , i say frankly , we have enough forces			0
" @entity40 said the government is supported by most @entity3 , who want the government to restore order " and continue the course to democratic transformation , to @entity33 integration			1
" but opposition leaders @entity64 and @entity66 have called on president @entity67 , currently on a trip to @entity69 , to sack the prime minister and his government by executive order			2
@entity64 , who gained fame as a boxer , vowed that the opposition would make sure its demands were met			0
among those demands was for someone to be held responsible for the violence against the demonstrators , he said			0
" it 's not enough to tell just ' sorry , ' it happens , ' " @entity64 told @entity82 's @entity81			2
" how many times do we have to listen to that ? " the battle over @entity3 : towards a new geopolitical game blockades since the weekend , tens of thousands of protesters have been descending on the capital 's @entity37 to voice their anger , and demonstrations show no signs of abating			1
the crowds have blocked the government 's main headquarters , preventing employees from going to work			2

the scenes are reminiscent of the 2004 @entity36 -- a populist movement that booted @entity67 , then prime minister , from office			0

" @entity67 told reporters on monday he supports a peaceful resolution to the " questions brought on by our citizens			0
" but he also warned his opponents : " as for the politicians participating in this , i consider any radicalization of the political process will only have negative consequences			0
" as the protests grip the nation -- split between pro-european regions in the west and a more @entity0 - oriented east , @entity3 's central bank said it would seek to maintain financial stability			1

opinion : beware @entity0 's power play in @entity3 the cause of the protests at the heart of the protests is @entity3 's about - face after a year of insisting that it would sign a political and trade agreement with the @entity151			1
last month , @entity7 suspended talks with the @entity151 , angering many @entity3 , who say the agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion			1
chief among @entity67 's reasons for backpedaling was @entity0 's opposition to it			1
@entity0 threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if it forged ahead with an @entity151 deal , but promised deep discounts on natural gas if it were to join the @entity11 - led @entity211 instead			1
@entity67 was also facing an @entity151 demand that he was unwilling to meet : free former prime minister @entity213 , his political opponent			2
the @entity36 that swept him from office also swept @entity213 to power			0
two years ago , she was found guilty of abuse of office in a @entity0 gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison in a case widely seen as politically motivated			1
her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment			0
@entity0 president @entity223 dismissed the protests monday , saying they are unrelated to @entity3 's turn away from the @entity151			1
he called them reminiscent of a " pogrom " rather than a revolution and an effort by the opposition to destabilize the government , @entity20 said			0
@entity67 on monday asked the @entity232 to receive a @entity3 delegation to discuss " some aspects " of the agreement @entity7 had been expected to sign , according to a statement from @entity148			1
commission president @entity237 acceded to the request but noted that the commission was not prepared " to reopen any kind of negotiations			0
