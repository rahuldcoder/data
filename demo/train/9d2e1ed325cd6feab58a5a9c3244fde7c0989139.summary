-- @entity1 is working with a controversial data company called @entity3 that can track whether people who see ads on the social networking site end up buying those products in stores			1
amid growing pressure for the social networking site to prove the value of its advertising , @entity1 is gradually wading into new techniques for tracking and using data about users that raise concerns among privacy advocates			1
" we kept hearing back [ from marketers ] that we needed to push further and help them do a better job , " said @entity19 , @entity1 's head of measurement and insights			0
@entity3 has purchasing data from about 70m @entity28 households largely drawn from loyalty cards and programmes at more than 1,000 retailers , including grocers and drug stores			1
by matching email addresses or other identifying information associated with those cards against emails or information used to establish @entity1 accounts , @entity3 can track whether people bought a product in a store after seeing an ad on @entity1			1
the emails and other identifying information are made anonymous and collected into groups of people who saw an ad and people who did not			2
@entity3 compiles a report for @entity1 and its advertisers to measure which creative approaches and demographic targeting persuade people to buy specific products offline			2
@entity1 said it is paying @entity3 for the data - matching			2
so far , the two companies have measured 45 campaigns and in 70 per cent of cases , for every dollar a marketer spent on @entity1 it earned an additional $ 3 in incremental sales , mr @entity19 said			0
marketers are eager for more data to see how their @entity1 ad campaigns perform , but some said they still are figuring out how to evaluate the new data			0
@entity68 said the information was promising , but a spokesman added that it was too early to give a formal opinion			0
" some privacy advocates question whether the practice violates the $ 9.5m settlement @entity1 struck with the @entity76 over charges that it deceived consumers by not keeping privacy promises			1
facebook users are automatically included in the advertising studies conducted with @entity3 , and can not directly opt out through their @entity1 account			2
instead , they must go to the @entity3 website , for which @entity1 has a link posted in its help centre			0
@entity88 , executive director of the @entity89 , a privacy group , said this practice does not provide @entity1 users with sufficient control over their data or with transparency over how it is being used			1
" we do n't believe any of this online - offline data should be used without express consumer approval and an opt - in , " he said			0
@entity1 and @entity3 said individual - level purchasing data were not shared with @entity1 or its advertisers			1
@entity1 user data are not shared with advertisers			0
