@entity0 was aglow in fire early wednesday , as demonstrators undeterred by a bloody day on the streets staked their claim to the heart of the @entity7 capital and , they hope , the heart of the country itself			1
such flames have been a constant for three months , acting as fiery barricades all around @entity0 's @entity14 , or @entity14 , for protesters			1
yet the flames grew more ominous on tuesday as at least 21 people died in fresh clashes between government forces and activists			1
what began with protests over president @entity24 's backpedaling from a trade pact with the @entity26 -- a move that the opposition maligned , accusing @entity24 of trying to cozy up to @entity29 rather than the @entity30 -- has spawned into something much larger			1
in addition to new elections , the opposition is calling for constitutional reforms to transfer more power from the presidency to the parliament			2
@entity24 and his allies have responded with some concessions , even offering places in government to opposition leaders			2
but on - again , off - again talks have gone nowhere , with the opposition refusing to budge politically and from its positions in the center of @entity0			1
none of that changed after a face - to - face meeting overnight between @entity24 and opposition leader @entity49			1
speaking to reporters afterward , @entity49 said there effectively was " no discussion			2
" according to his @entity55 party , the president demanded protesters " stop the standoff " and put down their weapons -- an accusation that @entity49 claimed is unfounded			1
" i think the authorities should immediately pull back the police and stop the blood , because people are dying , " @entity49 said			2
" i told @entity24 this			0
how can we negotiate when there is blood being spilled ? unfortunately , he does not understand it			0
" what 's behind @entity7 's political crisis ? deadliest day of political unrest tuesday 's violence followed what seemed like a rare breakthrough			1
protesters pulled back sunday from @entity0 's @entity77 and unlocked streets in the city center after the government said it 'd drop charges against those arrested in the political unrest			1
then everything fell apart tuesday			0
the speaker of parliament 's refusal to allow amendments that would limit the president 's powers and restore the constitution to what it was in 2004 angered many in the opposition			1
the government 's prosecutor general , meanwhile , accused the opposition of breaking " the truce " and , therefore , setting the stage for the crackdown			2
" for the sake of pursuing their own political interests , they neglected all previously reached agreements and put lives and the peace of millions of @entity0 residents under threat , " said @entity102 , @entity7 's prosecutor general			1
whoever was to blame , there was no dispute tuesday was the deadliest day -- by far -- in the political unrest			2
riot police used water cannons , stun grenades and other means to force their way through protesters , with video showing some of them toting shields and swinging sticks as they barreled through			1
some demonstrators fought back , swinging what looked like baseball bats or using other means			0
protesters also set fire to the headquarters of the ruling @entity132			2
authorities accused them of firing guns at security forces			0
a @entity137 employee at the scene saw demonstrators carrying pellet guns , though not with live ammunition			0
one video showed an armored personnel carrier charging toward demonstrators barricades , only to be inundated by a flurry of what appeared to be @entity148 cocktails			1
the vehicle then burst into flames			2
all the moving parts , different tactics and raw emotions contributed to a violent , chaotic melee in the center of @entity7 's capital			0
officials warned people to stay indoors and shuttered metro stations to help control the situation			0
the situation hardly calmed as night descended			0
black smoke and bright flames from burning tires continued to rage around @entity14 , just a few blocks from parliament			2
small explosions regularly erupted all night -- the product of protesters ' fireworks and , perhaps , the stun grenades that police have been using to clear the crowds			1
demonstrators also worked through the night to build up their barricades , by forming human chains to pass bricks , rocks and wood up their front lines in anticipation of another police offensive			0
@entity7 security forces did indeed move forward , despite a barrage of rocks , before halting their advance -- for now , at least			0
@entity0 was the center of the action , just like it has been all winter , with nine police officers , 11 protesters and an employee from the ruling party 's headquarters among those killed , according to officials			1
but it was n't just the capital			0
police confirmed the unrest has spread to western @entity7 , with protesters attacking police and local government offices in a number of regions			1
blame game , calls for restraint @entity102 , @entity7 's prosecutor general , blamed protesters for the violence that he said that -- in addition to those killed -- injured at least 100 others			1
the organizers of a rally tuesday that descended into violence will be held accountable " for every single person injured , every car burned and every window broken , " he said			0
" today , we were able to see that only the government is interested in peaceful resolution of the situation , " @entity102 said			0
" @entity226 leaders should take the responsibility for everything happening in the street of @entity0 today			1
" opposition leaders painted their supporters as the victims , not the aggressors			0
@entity49 , a former world class boxer turned politician , accused police of " cruelly shooting at people in central @entity0			1
" and @entity237 -- an opposition leader from a party other than @entity49 's -- made a public appeal to @entity24 : " do not let @entity7 become a country covered with blood			1
pull back the police and announce a cease - fire			0
" @entity245 vice president @entity244 himself pressed @entity24 in a phone call , with the @entity248 saying " the government bears special responsibility to de-escalate the situation			0
" secretary of state @entity252 later backed up the vice president 's words			0
he called for the @entity7 government to halt violence immediately , and reopen dialogue with the opposition			1
@entity252 : @entity245 , @entity26 stand with @entity7 's people on the flip side , @entity29 's state - run @entity262 's story on the latest @entity0 unrest noted @entity266 's persistent support for @entity24 and its accusation -- made earlier this week from foreign ministry spokesman @entity268 -- that @entity270 is trying to tell " the authorities of a sovereign state what they should do next and how they should do it			2
" such international back - and - forth is especially significant in the @entity7 , given not only its geographic and political position betwixt @entity277 and @entity29 and the origins of the latest unrest			0
it began in november with @entity24 's decision to scuttle an @entity26 trade pact that the opposition hoped would bring the @entity7 closer to the @entity30 , and improve its economy in the process			0
the next month , @entity29 president @entity286 announced that @entity29 would buy $ 15 billion in @entity7 debt and slash the price @entity0 pays for its gas			1
as the months rolled on , the conflict expanded beyond the long - simmering discord over whether @entity7 should align more with the @entity30 or with @entity29			0
the opposition has pressed to change how the @entity295 nation 's government operates , namely through constitutional and other reforms that would -- among other things -- shift powers away from its president and toward parliament			2
stop the ultimatums , @entity29 tells @entity7 protesters			0

video shows an armored personnel carrier hit by @entity306 , bursting into flames
an opposition leader says there was " no discussion " in his meeting with the president
a crisis that has been *brewing* for three months erupts in worst violence to date
the 21 killed in @entity0 *include* 9 police officers , 11 protesters and 1 political party official
