@entity1 helicopter gunships supported @entity4 ground forces battling @entity6 militants in @entity7 , military sources said , an action that brings @entity1 troops closer to combat			1
on saturday , the @entity1 military said @entity7 was " contested , " as @entity4 forces fought back			1
the @entity1 military friday deployed attack helicopters against an @entity6 assault on the strategic @entity17 about 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) south of @entity18 , sources said			1
@entity4 ground forces killed those attackers and the @entity22 safely returned to base without firing a shot , the source said			1
@entity24 , a former @entity25 officer , said the battles may indicate a deepening involvement of @entity1 troops in the fight against @entity6			1
" i think what we 're seeing here is mission creep , " he said			0
" the @entity4 army is not up to the task			2
and without the @entity38 and the military on the ground , a lot of these ... bases would be overrun			0
" @entity41 , a retired @entity42 lieutenant general , said he thought the @entity4 army was improving			2
" i think the @entity4 government is getting it back together and , yes , they do need help from coalition forces , @entity1 forces right now , " he said			1
" but they 're coming around and they realize what a scourge this organization [ @entity6 ] is			2
" @entity53 spokesman rear adm. @entity52 described the battle at the air base , saying , " it looks like they at least got to the outer base limits			1
we 're still looking at this and it 's hard to say whether they breached the perimeter or not			0
but they certainly got to the perimeter level at the very least			0
" he said 20 - 25 people led by suicide bombers made the attack			0
most , if not all , of the attackers were wearing @entity4 military uniforms , @entity52 said			2
the base is huge -- roughly the size of @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity52 said			0
that city is nearly 25 square miles			0
and @entity1 forces were " several kilometers " away from where the fighting happened , the @entity53 said in a statement			1
@entity81 , the largest military base in western @entity84 province still under government control , is where @entity1 instructors train @entity4 pilots			1
nearly 800 members of @entity4 security forces are training with coalition forces at the air base , the @entity89 said			1
and while military officials say the @entity1 forces were not directly threatened in the skirmish , @entity52 acknowledged that " no question that they 're close to danger			1
" the @entity1 team there -- some 400 strong -- does n't feel immediately threatened , but do have the " right , responsibility , obligation to shoot back " should militants threaten them , @entity52 said			2
@entity1 officials have repeatedly downplayed the possibility of renewed ground combat in @entity4 after the expensive and divisive @entity1 combat operation that drew to a close with the final withdrawal of troops in 2011			1
but @entity1 and coalition airstrikes do continue in the area			0
from thursday into friday , aircraft from the international coalition against @entity6 carried out eight airstrikes in @entity117 and seven in @entity4 , @entity89 said			1
five of the @entity4 airstrikes targeted @entity6 units and equipment near @entity81			1
the other two attacked targets near @entity124 and @entity125			0
the @entity126 said the airstrikes killed at least 20 @entity6 militants			2
@entity2 's @entity130 , said that @entity133 @entity132 fighters were starting to move from the north toward the city of @entity136 , held by @entity6 since the summer			2
the militants ' seizure of the city provoked a major humanitarian crisis as its ethnic minority @entity142 population fled onto the rocky slopes of @entity136 , where many became trapped without food and water			0
the @entity133 fighters are on the offensive but face a long , difficult battle to win back the city from @entity6 , whose fighters are firmly in control there			0
on thursday , @entity6 attacked @entity132 fighters in @entity136 , as well as @entity133 forces positioned north of @entity4 's second - largest city , @entity124 , and the town of @entity158 , east of @entity124			1
as fighting on the ground continued , @entity6 pressed forward with its propaganda campaign			0
the organization released photos purporting to show @entity6 attacks on security checkpoints near @entity165 and posted video purporting to show them parading captured @entity132 fighters through the streets in cages			0
@entity6 claims the video was shot in the @entity173 province of @entity4			2
@entity6 offered up video showing them fixing roads in the @entity178 area , about 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) north of @entity179			0
@entity2 can not confirm the authenticity of the images			0
@entity2 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
