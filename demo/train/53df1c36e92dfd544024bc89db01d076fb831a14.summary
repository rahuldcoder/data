several @entity1 men belonging to @entity2 took part in the terrorist attack on the @entity6 diplomatic compound in @entity7 last september , according to several sources who have spoken with @entity9			1
one senior @entity6 law enforcement official told @entity9 that " three or four members of @entity14 , " or @entity14 , took part in the attack			1
another source briefed on the @entity7 investigation said @entity18 intelligence services suspect the men may have been sent by the group specifically to carry out the attack			1
but it 's not been ruled out that they were already in the city and participated as the opportunity arose			0
the attack on the compound and subsequently on a " safe - house " to which @entity6 had been evacuated left four @entity6 citizens dead , including the ambassador to @entity31 , @entity30			2
if the @entity14 members were dispatched to @entity7 , it would be further evidence of a new level of co-operation among jihadist groups throughout the @entity39 and @entity40 , counterterrorism analysts say			1
according to one source , counterterrorism officials learned the identity of the men and established they had spent two nights in @entity7 after the attack			1
western intelligence agencies began trying to track the men in the aftermath of the terrorist attack , but were always behind in their manhunt			1
they were later traced to northern @entity53 , where they are believed to have connected with a fighting group commanded by @entity56 , a prominent jihadist leader , according to a senior law enforcement source			1
the trail appears to have then gone cold			1
in early 2013 , jihadists were driven out of many areas of northern @entity53 in a @entity62 - led offensive			1
another source briefed on the investigation had previously told @entity9 that @entity56 had received a call in the aftermath of the @entity7 attack from someone in or close to the city			1
whoever made the call was excited			0
" @entity74 , @entity74 ! " he repeated , meaning " congratulations " in @entity73			0
there is no proof the call was specifically about the attack , but the source says that is the assumption among those with knowledge of the call			1
one source says the phone call was discovered when a @entity18 intelligence service trawled through intercepts of communications made in the wake of the attack			1
@entity90 officials told @entity9 they had no comment on whether any call had been intercepted			0
one other source briefed by @entity18 intelligence told @entity9 a call was intercepted but said only that it was placed to an @entity97 commander , not specifically @entity98			1
@entity56 is an @entity99 terrorist operative linked to @entity97 who claimed responsibility for the attack on the @entity103 gas facility in southern @entity99 in january this year			2
some 38 people were killed during a three - day siege there			0
@entity108 troops supporting the @entity62 intervention in @entity53 claimed in march that @entity56 and others in his group had been killed during an operation in the remote @entity115 des @entity114 mountain range			1
there has never been any confirmation of his death , and one source briefed by @entity18 and regional intelligence officials told @entity9 that @entity56 may have started operating in the " desert triangle " straddling the borders of @entity99 , @entity123 and @entity31			1
@entity56 is believed to have moved to the region in late 2012 after signs that an international intervention in @entity53 was growing more likely			1
known as ' the @entity129 pass , ' the area is a key transit points for drug traffickers and international criminal groups			0
the @entity133 released grainy photographs wednesday of three men said to have been at the @entity7 compound on the night of the attack , saying it was " seeking information " on them			2
it is not known whether any of them are the @entity14 individuals			1
@entity14 is regarded as one of the most active and dangerous of @entity2 franchises			1
it has tried to launch several attacks on the @entity6 homeland			0
on christmas day 2009 , a @entity145 recruited by the group attempted to blow up a plane flying into @entity148 but failed because his device malfunctioned			0
the following october the group attempted to blow up planes heading to the @entity6 with printer bombs disguised as air cargo			0
the packages were intercepted after a tip from @entity158 intelligence			2
and in april 2012 , a @entity160 informant working for @entity158 counterterrorism thwarted a new plot by the group to bomb a @entity6 - bound airliner			0
the informant had infiltrated the group and was selected by them to launch the attack			2
@entity14 was the first @entity2 affiliate to comment on the @entity7 attack			1
on september 14 it released a statement arguing the attack was revenge for the death of @entity172 , a senior @entity2 operative , in @entity173 in june 2012			2
it did not claim responsibility for the attack			2
on september 10 -- at least 18 hours before the attack -- @entity2 leader @entity181 , in a video timed for the anniversary of 9/11 , called for attacks on @entity6 in @entity31 to avenge the death of @entity172			2
in march , @entity31 authorities detained a man called @entity184 in @entity31 on suspicion of links to the attack , according to several officials			2
the @entity133 was able to interview him in the presence of @entity31 officials , according to one @entity31 source			2
it appears @entity184 was detained after returning from a trip to @entity173 , sources said			2
it remains unclear exactly whether @entity184 was present at the @entity6 compound at the time of the attack			0
it 's also unclear whether his detention is likely to lead to charges in connection with the attack			0
investigators have learned that @entity184 has had contact with the @entity1 - based @entity14 as well as @entity2 members in @entity173 , sources said			1
the @entity31 @entity208 refused to confirm he is still in custody , saying it could not comment on an ongoing investigation			0
@entity212 is the only known suspect in custody in connection with the attack in @entity7			1
a 26 - year - old @entity215 , @entity216 , was held in @entity217 for several weeks in connection with the assault on the compound after being extradited from @entity221			0
but he was released by a @entity215 judge in january on grounds on insufficient evidence			0
in december , a @entity6 official with direct knowledge of the investigation said authorities were examining whether the alleged leader of a post-revolution terrorist network in @entity231 had played a role in the september 11 attack			0
@entity234 was released from jail after the downfall of @entity231 president @entity237 and is believed to be the driving force behind a new militant group , according to two @entity6 officials			0
@entity234 was previously a member of @entity181 's group , @entity241			0
he is currently in prison in @entity231 after being arrested in december , when police raided a @entity245 apartment allegedly being used by a jihadist group			0
an associate of @entity234 's subsequently said that he had not been in @entity7 or anywhere in @entity31 on the day of the attack on the compound			0
in the wake of the revolts that have shaken the @entity255 world , @entity2 sympathizers have found new space in which to operate , and would - be jihadists have found new causes to embrace			0
in @entity260 , the @entity259 has proclaimed its links to the @entity2 affiliate in @entity263			0
militants from @entity215 , @entity31 and elsewhere have gone to @entity260			0
in west @entity40 , @entity145 jihadists with @entity266 have established links with @entity97 and trained in @entity53			2
if @entity14 sent members thousands of miles to help launch an attack on @entity6 diplomats , it would show that even if @entity2 central remains under pressure , its fellow travelers are finding new ways to continue its campaign of terror .			1

" three or four members of @entity14 , " took part , one source says
western intelligence services suspect they may have been sent to carry out the attack
they were later traced to northern @entity53 , where the trail appears to have gone cold
