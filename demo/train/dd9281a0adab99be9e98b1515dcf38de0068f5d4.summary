it was in the town of @entity18 , where activists say mothers , daughters , sisters and wives -- many who brought children of their own -- gathered outside the @entity27 building and demanded rights they say their loved ones have been denied for far too long			2
as @entity5 is an absolute monarchy where protests are prohibited , it did n't take long for the police to show up			1
one amateur video purported to show what happened next , with security forces encircling the women before they 're taken away			0
@entity5 activists say kingdom trying to silence them @entity40 said 18 women and 10 children were arrested and it quickly issued a statement calling for their release			1
" according to reports and photos from the protest , these women and children merely gathered peacefully and held placards bearing their detained relatives ' names and the length of their detention , " said @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity48 program director at @entity40			2
" there is no way the @entity5 authorities can justify detaining people if they have simply peacefully exercised their rights to freedom of expression and assembly			1
" activists say by early the next day , at least seven of the women had been released , but that was n't enough to quell the rising tide of anger over the incident			0
in @entity5 , the jailing of women is an extremely sensitive issue			1
in @entity78 , which is the provincial capital of deeply conservative @entity80 , the issue is even more sensitive than in other parts of the country			0
one amateur video shows a group of men angrily marching through @entity78 at night			0
as they hold up signs announcing how the arrest of women is a red line that should never be crossed , they also chant slogans declaring themselves unafraid of the country 's interior minister , @entity93 , and demanding he release the women			2
@entity5 journalist @entity96 , who has been covering the story , told @entity0 that when she went to @entity78 to meet some of the women , she was followed by the @entity5 secret police -- known as the @entity100 -- and felt compelled to leave the town			1
" when i spoke to some of the women later , " said @entity102 , " they told me ' we will continue protesting until our husbands and relatives are released			0
