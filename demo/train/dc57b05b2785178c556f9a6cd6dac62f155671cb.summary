-- @entity2 's economic powerhouse was once thought of as the ugly sister to @entity6 's beach - fronted glamour			1
@entity7 , the world 's fifth - largest city , is the fashion capital of @entity2			1
but , over the past few years , @entity7 's fashion , music and design scenes have gained such momentum that it 's tipped by some as a cooler destination than more touristy @entity6			1
true , @entity7 does n't have a beach , nor does it go out of its way to cater to foreign visitors , but hidden in the sprawl is a trove of hip hotels and restaurants , modernist architecture and some of the best shopping south of the @entity25			1
it would take a lot longer than a day to discover everything @entity7 has to offer , but our guide should help visitors short on time to navigate the city 's immense grid of skyscrapers and traffic jams to find an entirely different @entity2 experience			1
watch the sun come up over the world 's fifth - largest urban area like many of its mega-wealthy inhabitants -- with a helicopter ride over the city			2
tourist rides normally leave from @entity46 and take in aerial views of city landmarks such as @entity49 and @entity50			0
you may have worked up an appetite by now , so head back into town for breakfast on @entity55 , @entity7 's answer to @entity57			1
eat delicious cheese bread known as @entity59 , fruit , yoghurt and granola , and wash it down with a freshly squeezed juice or coffee at @entity65			0
the prosperous , tree - lined avenues of the surrounding area , known as @entity68 , are perfect for a bit of shopping			0
look out for @entity71 , where you can buy upscale designerwear in divine surroundings ( @entity55 913 ) and @entity75 , a collaborative shop filled with cubes of shelving where entrepreneurs can rent a cubby - hole to sell their wares			0
from here it 's possible to walk to @entity50 , @entity7 's financial district , and there you can mill past some of the most expensive real estate in @entity87 with the @entity7 businessfolk on your way to take in some culture at @entity92 , also known as @entity92 once you 've had your fill of high culture , take in some of @entity7 's famous street art on @entity97 , which translates as " @entity98			1
" every inch of this street in the super hip @entity103 area is covered in graffiti , much of it by well - known local artists			0
recharge your batteries with a beer and snack on empadas , delicious miniature pies with a variety of fillings like palm hearts , @entity116 salted fish and cheese at @entity118 ( @entity119 489 , @entity103 )			0
otherwise , why not hop in a cab and head over to @entity121 to check out the home of the biggest @entity124 community anywhere in the world outside @entity124 ? check out the @entity127 temple ( @entity128 ) , karaoke bars and sushi restaurants -- one of the best of which is @entity134 ( @entity135 746 , @entity136 )			0
with its green - copper facade , the @entity137 is just one example of @entity7 's stunning modern architecture			1
the highlight of this area , if you happen to be lucky enough to be there at the right time , is the anything - goes weekend market @entity136 ( @entity148 ) , and if you 're even luckier you might catch one of the sumo competitions held there from time to time			0
after all these hours in the concrete jungle you may be longing for a bit of green , which you can find in ample supply in the enormous @entity49			0
as you wander the tree - lined walkways , dodging throngs of body - conscious @entity158 exercising along the way , you will encounter one masterpiece of modernist architecture after another -- mostly designed by the father of @entity2 modernism @entity165			1
look out for the beautiful sci - fi dome , @entity168 , and the @entity169 , an extraordinary white pavilion that houses @entity172 ( @entity171 ) and features expanses of covered concrete which attract many of the city 's skateboarders			2
no visit to @entity7 , or indeed any part of @entity2 , is complete without trying a caipirinha -- a winning combination of the local firewater , cachaça , smashed limes , sugar and ice			2
if spirits are a bit much for you , try a divine -- and very @entity7 -- twist on the original with squished kiwi fruit and sake			2
you could combine a few cocktails with catching the final rays of the day on the rooftop of another of @entity7 's modernist masterpieces , @entity197 ( @entity198 , @entity199 344 )			1
here you can enjoy a breathtaking panorama , with another @entity165 masterpiece -- the wavy - façaded @entity202 -- in full view			2
it 's got to be dinner time by now			0
in @entity7 your options are almost unlimited			0
with huge populations of @entity124 , @entity209 and even @entity210 , the problem is not where to eat but how to choose			0
a highlight of @entity7 's dining scene has to be @entity213 , where you can eat awesome steaks and very good seafood in a dining room that has been built around an enormous fig tree			1
if you 're still rearing to go after that little lot , @entity7 's nightlife options are almost endless			1
you can shake your moneymaker with the best of them at one of the city 's clubland stalwarts @entity229 , or if you are looking for something a little more low - key , then why not round off the day on the rooftop terrace of the @entity232 at @entity233			2
the hotel 's space - age green copper façade is indeed unique , and it is also a good bet for a bed for the night in really special surroundings .			0

@entity7 's art , fashion and music scene means it 's no longer second to @entity6
among the grid of skyscrapers is iconic modernist architecture by @entity165
uniquely @entity2 , the city also has a twist of other cultures
