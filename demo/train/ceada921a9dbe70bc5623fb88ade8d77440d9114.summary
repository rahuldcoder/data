-- @entity1 drove nonstop for 21 hours to see the launch of space shuttle challenger in june 1983			1
she had seen shuttle launches before , but this trip from @entity6 , @entity7 , to @entity8 , @entity9 , was different : @entity10 was about to become the first female @entity12 astronaut to leave the @entity14 's atmosphere			0
@entity1 was proud to watch the first female astronaut take flight			1
she was even more proud at the thought of @entity10 's achievement inspiring more women to work in the space program			1
in a field that was almost entirely dominated by men , @entity1 had been working as a satellite engineer for seven years			1
@entity1 shared photos of the launch with @entity26 as @entity27 prepared for the final flight in its shuttle program			1
she recalled the moment of joy these pictures capture : standing in front of the towering mass of the shuttle challenger , she smiles as she shoulders the camera she used to record the event			0
" seeing the launch was a confirmation of what i had held on to , " she said			0
" women could achieve their dreams			1
" @entity1 , the 57 - year - old daughter of @entity44 immigrants , is a self - proclaimed " technorican , " a portmanteau for her love of technology and her heritage			1
it 's a moniker she earned through years of work : she studied astrophysics at @entity53 , worked on experimental satellite research at @entity6 and developed next - generation software for the shuttle program			1
she came of age with classic science fiction , like the original " @entity60 " television series			1
growing up first in the @entity65 and then @entity61 , @entity7 , the steel palisades of the @entity64 skyline resembled to her some kind of otherworldly spaceship docked in the @entity68 , fueling her already - wild imagination			0
" i thought about the future a lot as a child , because i recognized that the present and the past were n't very happy places for people , " she said			2
" so , to me , the future was always going to be better			0
" and as a @entity44 , i really connected with the diversity of the @entity80 's crew , that vision of a utopian , multi-ethnic future			0
" weaned on the vision of an enlightened spacefaring society that " @entity60 " offered , and inspired by president @entity86 's call to put an @entity12 on the moon , @entity1 dedicated herself at an early age to working in the space program			1
" it was easy to aspire to a future like that where people got along regardless of race or religion , just because they were human			0
being a lifelong ' @entity60 ' fan made me see the space program not just as sci - fi , but as a positive vision of the future , at a time when we desperately needed those positive visions			1
" but as a teenager , @entity1 faced a chorus of no 's every time she talked with her family and friends about her nascent passion for space exploration			1
" no , " @entity112 are n't astrophysicists			2
" no , " women ca n't be astronauts			1
" i always knew that if i wanted to reach my goals , i was going to have to work hard and never quit , " she said			2
" i had to work through a lot of personal things too , because i was so self - conscious			2
i was a fireball inside , but socially i was very uncomfortable around other people a lot of the time			0
but when it 's something that matters to me , the fireball comes out ! " at the age of 14 , she joined the @entity128 [ @entity128 ] , and learned to fly a plane before she could drive a car			0
as one of the handful of female cadets in her troop , she learned marching , drilling and wilderness survival through one of the few such programs in which girls were allowed to participate			0
yet her dreams were seemingly cut short by the institutionalized sexism that was all too common in the @entity12 before the women 's rights movement entered public consciousness			2
" i guess the moment that crystallized it for me was the day we found out that the girl cadets could n't go on a search - and - rescue mission as part of our classes , " she said			2
" we were supposed to go find a businessman who was lost in the woods , but the girls were not allowed			0
" these denials only strengthened her resolve , equipping @entity1 with a purpose and drive to match the skills she had already developed in aviation , math and science			1
at @entity53 , she enrolled in an aerospace engineering program where she was one of fewer than 10 women in classes with hundreds of men			1
" they were definitely not happy about having women in the class , " she said			2
" i did n't have any kind of support system			2
i did n't get to know any of the other women , and the guys basically ignored me			1
" after four years studying topics as broad as astrophysics , astronomy and theoretical geology , she graduated in 1976 with an interdisciplinary major in space science			2
the day after graduating from @entity53 , she was offered a job at @entity6 , where she aided in the development of the experimental @entity183 ' @entity182 ' satellite program			2
she worked in the university 's astrophysics department for seven years			0
there , she frequently collaborated with dr. @entity187 , one of the principal architects of the @entity189			0
in 1983 , only a few weeks after @entity10 's historic launch , @entity1 was finally offered her dream job : a post at @entity27 's @entity193 in @entity194			1
she worked there for two decades as a software engineer and astrophysicist , first on the @entity198 and then as a systems engineer for the @entity200			0
her favorite souvenir from her career at @entity27 is a life - size cutout of the half - @entity205 engineer @entity204 from " @entity60 : voyager			1
" the cutout 's story began when @entity208 , the actor who portrayed the fictional @entity209 , visited @entity193 in the late 1990s			0
though the two never spoke one - on - one , @entity1 joked that she was " the real engineer @entity1			1
" when @entity210 later heard about the quip , she sent her the cutout			0
for @entity1 , a simple cardboard cutout from " @entity60 " embodies both the adventurous spirit of the space program and the personal convictions that carried her through life			1
" i will quote my friend @entity219 , an astronaut who did some of the @entity189 walks , and a former classmate of mine , " she went on			0
" he would show a picture of a child at the beach , holding a seashell			0
we 're all born to be explorers , just like a little child marveling at a seashell			0
" i remember being like that , and i like to think i still am			0
with a lot of people , it gets worked out of you over the years , but i always held on to that childlike willingness to ask ' what if ? ' "			0

@entity1 ' love of " @entity60 " inspired her to dedicate her life to @entity27
despite being told that woman could n't work in the space program , she *persisted*
one of the first women to work in aerospace
