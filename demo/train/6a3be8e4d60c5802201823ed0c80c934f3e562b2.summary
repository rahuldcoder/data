-- @entity1 is n't your average one year old			1
he started walking before he was one			2
oh , and , he 's going to be king -- of 16 countries			1
i had to remind myself occasionally of that latter fact as i stood outside the hospital in @entity10 where he was born ... for a week before his arrival			1
it went against my journalistic instinct to report on a story that had n't happened yet but if i did n't appear regularly on air , giving an update about what had n't happened , then the assumption was that it had and rumors would start which i would have to come back on air to refute			2
if you ca n't beat them , join them			2
when " the royal baby " did emerge , there was a collective sense of relief and excitement among the assembled media			1
he was already one of the biggest stars in the world and we did n't even know his name			1
before we knew it he was whisked away , with his father in the driving seat , to @entity39			2
soon he was in the @entity41 home in @entity42 , southern @entity43 , where @entity44 had spent much of her pregnancy			2
it 's safe , private , protected			1
the @entity47 wanted to keep @entity1 's world small and intimate in those early days so that mother , father and baby could bond			1
to satisfy intense media interest , they released an official photo			1
it was n't taken by a professional outsider who would burst the bubble -- rather it was a family snap taken by @entity1 's grandfather , @entity58			1
i met @entity60 during that first fortnight and he was exhausted and elated , the hallmarks of a hands - on dad			0
the duke always tries to do things himself if he can			0
he does n't like fuss			0
it may have gone against royal tradition but it was n't intentional			0
we did n't see @entity1 again for another three months when he appeared bright eyed and wriggling in his father 's arms for his christening at @entity74			1
it was all about the cheeks			0
after the service , he had his first professional photo shoot with celebrity photographer @entity79			0
" he did n't start screaming , " @entity79 recalls			0
" you know , he giggled away and put his arms up ... i was astonished , that having done the pictures , the level of interest here			0
" i had a really weird moment where , straight after shooting the christening pictures , i was doing a job in @entity89 and i changed planes in @entity91			0
and i walked through the airport , and it was like that ' being @entity95 ' poster where everyone in the airport was reading ' @entity98 and this picture on the cover , and this picture was like staring at me everywhere			0
it was just really strange moment , when you 're like ' wow this picture is like everywhere			0
' " when @entity1 was eight months old , @entity79 was brought back in and took another picture of the family ahead of their tour in april to @entity108 and @entity109			1
he chose a shot of them sitting at a window in @entity39			0
" i went back and he was a little boy now , not a baby , " says bell			0
" he was crawling around , and you know , they grow up so quick ! " @entity1 was growing fast			1
in @entity108 a special playdate was convened for @entity1 with local youngsters of the same age			1
his size became apparent as he towered over all but one of his @entity125 counterparts			0
in a distinctly un-regal moment he grabbed a toy block from another baby who cried			0
her parents are still hoping that they will stay in touch			2
the young prince appeared again in @entity132 during a trip to the zoo			0
@entity1 was pulling himself up on the sides of a bilby enclosure and started walking shortly after he got back to the @entity137			1
the latest set of pictures , released to mark his birthday this week , show @entity1 on a day out at the @entity141 in @entity10			1
it could be any toddler 's day out			2
and it 's this normality that 's the running theme throughout his first year in pictures			1
his parents know that but they 're protecting him for as long as they can .			2
