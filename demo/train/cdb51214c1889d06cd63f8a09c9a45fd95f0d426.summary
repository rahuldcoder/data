@entity0 -- it 's been a year since the parents of a severely disabled child made public their decision to submit their daughter to a hysterectomy , breast surgery and drugs to keep the girl forever small			1
today , the couple tell @entity1 , they believe they made the right decision -- one that could have a profound impact on the care of disabled children worldwide			0
the profoundly disabled girl known as @entity18 , now 10 , has achieved her full height , 4 feet 5 inches			1
" the ' @entity22 ' has been successful in every expected way , " @entity18 's parents told @entity1 exclusively in a lengthy e-mail interview			1
" it has potential to help many others like it helped our precious daughter			0
" while unwavering in their belief in the treatment , @entity18 's parents continue to insist on anonymity			1
in the year since @entity18 's parents went public , not only did the hospital that sterilized @entity18 admit it broke @entity33 state law , but also the doctor who treated @entity18 committed suicide			1
as scrutiny of the case deepens , so too does the chasm in the medical community : is it mutilation , with doctors " playing @entity43 " -- or , is stunting growth a liberating option for caregivers and the disabled children who will need constant care for the rest of their lives ? @entity18 is now 10 years old and , at 4 feet 5 inches tall , has achieved her full height and weight , 63 pounds			1
the treatment permanently closed her growth plates and took more than a foot off her anticipated height			2
" @entity18 did not grow in height or weight in the last year , she will always be flat - chested , and she will never suffer any menstrual pain , cramps or bleeding , " say her parents , who felt it important to publicly address their decision after repeated interview requests , in the hopes of sharing their experience with other families			1
they responded by e-mail only , to protect the family 's identity			0
( read the complete interview ) @entity18 's current state -- to them -- is the definition of success			1
she was born brain - damaged , with a condition described as static encephalopathy , or cerebral palsy			0
one of her doctors described her mental capacity as that of a 6 - month - old , dependent upon her parents to meet every need			2
she does not walk or talk ; she 's fed through a tube and wears diapers			0
when @entity18 was 6 , her parents approached @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity33 , for the operations			1
they believed this would make it easier to cuddle and carry a child who can do little more than lie propped on a pillow			0
weight and height are the " worst enemy , " they write , for children such as @entity18 , for whom they 've coined the term " pillow angels			2
" in 2004 , @entity86 performed a hysterectomy , removed @entity18 's breast buds and gave her high - dose estrogen to retard growth and sexual maturation -- a procedure that has risks , but to date has not harmed her , her parents say			1
while the " @entity22 " was first published in the october 2006 issue of the @entity112 , it was n't until the family posted its blog last year that a firestorm erupted in the blogosphere , with responses from " inhumane " and " perverse " -- to " walk in our shoes			2
" " if parents of children like @entity18 believe this treatment will improve their children 's quality of life , then they should be diligent and tenacious in providing it for them , " her parents write			1
" we have a sacred duty to do what we believe is right for our children			0
" but in @entity18 's case , what her parents thought was right was n't legal			1
in may 2007 , @entity86 admitted it broke state law by giving @entity18 a hysterectomy without a proper court review			2
to perform any such treatment today would require a court order , as well as review by a panel of experts in medicine and ethics and people with disabilities , says dr. @entity145 of @entity146 , the consulting ethicist on @entity18 's case			1
so , will doctors stop the growth of more children like @entity18 ? right now , no growth - attenuation therapy is being administered by other doctors anywhere in the nation , according to pediatric experts			1
supporters wonder whether another factor , the suicide in september of @entity18 's endocrinologist , dr. @entity157 , may have slowed wider adoption of the treatment			1
" we know from reliable sources his treatment of our daughter was a source of energy and motivation for him , " @entity18 's parents write			1
" he was frustrated about being blocked from providing this treatment to other children in need			0
he strongly believed this treatment should be available to them			0
" the family appears to be the lone voice with that opinion ; @entity1 shared the family 's comment with @entity86 , but did not get a response			0
in media reports , colleagues and family members were said to believe @entity157 's suicide was not related to the treatment of the girl			2
another complicating factor -- some doctors remain adamant the treatment should n't be available			2
but for a child , we 're making decisions for them and hoping in our heart of hearts we are making the right decisions , " says dr. @entity191 , chairman of the @entity192 with @entity193			0
@entity191 will push for consensus among doctors at a pediatrics conference later this year , but acknowledges strong discord as critics continue to insist that keeping children small reduces them to a permanent infant - like condition , denying the basic human right to experience an adult body , adult feelings and adult relationships			2
but for @entity18 , that may be moot			2
" [ this disability ] shatters the reason we become parents : to watch kids grow , to be part of their lives and to launch into their own lives , " says @entity191			0
" when you have a child with lifelong dependency , you do n't get to launch your kid , and your caregiver options are limited			0
" but like many other people with disabilities , 43 - year - old @entity228 , who also has cerebral palsy but in a much less severe form than @entity18 's , sees the treatment as dehumanizing -- and perhaps most significantly -- irrevocable			1
" the parents are not seeing the potential of the child ; they are seeing a baby , " says @entity228			0
" people with disabilities have to look at the potential of our lives : of available new technology , new equipment , medical advances			0
things can change so quickly now			0
" some ethicists , too , remain staunch in their assessment that the " @entity22 " is a violation of not only human dignity , but also of a physician 's oath to do no harm			0
" i think mutilating surgery involving removal of breast buds is indefensible under any circumstances , " says @entity251 , the chairman of the @entity252 and director of the @entity254 at the @entity255			0
" growth retardation is not a substitute for adequate home aides and home assistance			0
" @entity18 's parents remain convinced what they did for @entity18 is the most loving choice they could have made for their daughter and want that for other disabled children			1
" we feel that if our time and effort ended up helping a single pillow angel ... then it is worthwhile			1
" e-mail to a friend			0
