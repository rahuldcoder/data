@entity0 -- perhaps it was because rep. @entity3 was in her element at the @entity1 / @entity6 @entity5			1
with her campaign flagging , the founder of the @entity8 in @entity9 delivered a surprise body blow to the @entity13 front - runner , @entity14 gov. @entity12			1
challenging @entity12 on his 2007 executive order that required @entity14 schoolgirls to receive vaccinations against the sexually transmitted hpv virus , @entity3 suggested the governor acted for purely political reasons			1
" i just wanted to add that we can not forget that in the midst of this executive order there is a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate			0
we ca n't deny that , " @entity3 said			2
she went on to point out that at the time of the executive order , @entity12 's former chief of staff was a top lobbyist for @entity30 , the manufacturer for the hpv vaccine			1
" the drug company gave thousand of dollars in political donations to the governor , " @entity3 said			2
" and this is just flat - out wrong			0
" fact check : did @entity3 's drug lobbyist claims ring true ? the moment came as @entity1 moderator @entity39 was about to turn to former sen. @entity40 for his take on the controversy			1
but @entity12 was given a chance to respond			2
" the company was @entity30 , and it was a $ 5,000 contribution that i had received from them			0
i raise about $ 30 million			0
and if you 're saying that i can be bought for $ 5,000 , i 'm offended , " @entity12 replied			2
@entity3 , who was reluctant to do battle in last week 's debate in @entity51 , could have landed a knockout punch			1
she could have asked : " so governor , what is your price ? " but she allowed the debate to move on			0
still , the congresswoman from @entity58 revived a long - running but largely overlooked complaint about @entity12			2
adversaries of the @entity14 governor have said for years he is a " crony capitalist			0
" @entity62 , the man @entity12 beat in his first statewide race for @entity14 agriculture commissioner , often says there are three ways to look at the state 's longest - serving governor -- " cronyism , phonyism and goofyism			1
" @entity12 's allies can brush off @entity62			1
but not former @entity73 gov. @entity72			0
in her strongest indication yet she may enter the race for the @entity13 nomination , @entity72 strongly condemned @entity12 's actions in an interview on @entity79 after the debate			1
" this is crony capitalism			0
that 's part of the problem we have in this country			0
people are afraid , even within our own party , to call one another out on that , " @entity72 said			0
@entity12 was in damage control for most of the night			0
the first question of the debate came from a tea party activist who wanted to know how the candidates would change @entity96 and sell the reforms to @entity99 's crucial senior citizen voters			1
but the opening round was really about the @entity14 governor , who has called @entity96 a " @entity102			1
" read more about whether @entity12 is conflicted on @entity96 " it has been called a @entity102 by many people long before me			1
but no one 's had the courage to stand up and say , ' here is how we 're going to reform it , ' " @entity12 said			2
former @entity112 gov. @entity111 tried to pin down his arch rival on what exactly that overhaul would look like			1
" do you still believe that @entity96 should be ended as a federal program ? " @entity111 asked			1
" i think we ought to have a conversation , " @entity12 replied			0
" we 're having that right now , governor			0
we 're running for president , " @entity111 shot back			0
" and i 'll finish this conversation , " @entity12 answered			0
fact check : is @entity96 a " @entity102 ? ' for most of the night , the debate was about @entity12			1
that 's usually a sign a candidate is winning			2
former @entity129 gov. @entity128 and @entity40 tried on several occasions to draw the @entity14 governor into their own rhetorical duels , to no avail			2
that 's usually a sign a candidate is losing			2
" let me say for @entity12 to say that you ca n't secure the border i think is pretty much a treasonous comment , " @entity128 said			0
it was an attempt to hit @entity12 on border security by resurrecting the @entity14 governor 's controversial comment that @entity146 chairman @entity145 would be guilty of treason if he took actions to stabilize the economy during an election cycle			1
perhaps it was too much for the audience to absorb			0
but his status as a front - runner was still intact , at least for the moment			1
on thursday , @entity12 is scheduled to visit @entity157			0
that 's not a terribly important primary state for @entity13			2
but it is a crucial battleground in the general election , a sign of @entity12 's @entity14 - size confidence			1
the trick for the rest of the @entity13 field is to convince @entity5 voters the race is not over yet .			0

most of debate *centers* on @entity14 gov. @entity12 -- usually a sign a candidate is winning
rep. @entity3 goes after @entity12 on his hpv vaccine order for schoolgirls
*ex-massachusetts* gov. @entity111 again attacks @entity12 on @entity96
@entity12 's status as @entity13 front - runner remains intact , at least for the moment
