-- they 're the generation that came of age in the 1950s and 1960s , that remembers @entity5 and the @entity6 , the assassinations of @entity8 and @entity9 , transistor radios and the novelty of the first color tv sets			2
or ... they experienced their formative years in the 1970s , forced to choose between punk and disco as the @entity16 unfolded , hard drug use exploded , and television sitcoms introduced untraditional households such as " @entity20 , " " @entity21 , " and " @entity22			0
" numerous books , films and academic papers have been devoted to defining the impact of the 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 , known as baby boomers , boomies or the bulge			1
their sheer volume in the @entity33 fueled an unprecedented population boom , from 141 million in 1946 to 311 million in 2010 , according to the @entity35			1
the first wave of baby boomers is turning 65 this year , but the youngest are 47			1
defining the entire group is a risky endeavor , given its almost 20 - year spread			0
but there 's one thing historians , economists and pop culture junkies agree on : baby boomers ' numbers have allowed them to leave an imprint in each phase of life they passed through , a vast departure from their parents ' generation			1
next , the boomer generation will change the way we think about retirement and aging , experts and analysts say , just as they transformed notions of relationships -- with delayed marriages , fewer children , more divorces -- and ideas about careers , with more women in the workplace and adult learning			1
@entity33 generations through the years " boomers are all about exploration and transformation			1
many of them reject the idea of retirement that they saw firsthand with their parents , where you stop changing and growing and become a fixed entity , " said @entity75 of @entity76 , which tracks consumer attitudes that forecast lifestyle and behaviors , and author of " @entity81 : how @entity89			2
" " boomers have a hard time giving up control			2
for them , control is a fundamental right born out of basic entitlement -- they grew up in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity and a basic feeling that the struggle for survival was over			0
many have never been in love with the idea of retirement , but at least they felt like it was an option they could control			2
but now because of the economy and the hit their portfolios took , they 're revamping their plans , and i do n't think most boomers know what they 're going to end up doing			2
" but the day is fast approaching for many			0
the boomers are the main reason for projections that the number of @entity33 65 and older will reach 88.5 million by 2050 , more than double the estimated 40.2 million in that group in 2010 , according to a @entity119 , " the @entity120			1
" by 2030 , when all of the boomers will be 65 or older , they will make up 19 % of the population , up from 13 % today			1
the aging of the baby boom will have wide - ranging implications for the country , raising challenges for policymakers and programs such as @entity132 and @entity133 , said @entity134 , director of the center on the @entity136 and @entity137 at the @entity138			2
baby boomers crowded classrooms and later , the labor force , boosting the economy and consumer spending while their taxes funded @entity132 benefits and @entity133 for the elderly			0
in 2010 , 60 % of the @entity33 population was between 20 and 64 years old			1
by 2030 , as baby boomers age , the proportion in those working ages will drop to 55 % , according to " the @entity120			2
" boomers are leaving the labor force at a time when health care costs are growing at a rate faster than productivity and per capita income growth , leaving a big gap , @entity134 said			0
the average annual expenditure on health care in 2004 for people ages 45 to 54 was $ 2,695			0
when budgeting medical expenses , baby boomers should expect increased health care spending as they age ; for instance , those ages 55 to 64 spent $ 3,262 and those 65 and over spent $ 3,899 , according to the @entity33 @entity168			1
" there 's already a clear sense of what the situation is			0
we know that our social programs are not sustainable the way they 're currently structured , and benefits are going to have to be cut or taxes increased			0
but that does n't mean the public has absorbed that fact or believe it , so it 's difficult for politicians to do anything serious to come to grips with the problems , " @entity134 said			0
but that does n't necessarily mean the blame should be placed on the boomers , he said			0
population aging is universal and inevitable -- the baby boomers merely postponed the day of reckoning			2
" the problems we 're going to have are problems we would have had without the baby boomers			0
they just happen to be the generation that 's initiating them			0
the problem is real and serious but by no means catastrophic , " he said			0
the baby boomers will continue steering @entity33 culture as they age , too			1
they were the first generation of children and teenagers with significant spending power , economist @entity202 of the @entity203 said			0
that , combined with their numbers , fueled massive marketing campaigns and the introduction of new products targeted at their current stage of life , whether they were young families or looking toward retirement			1
" @entity220 became the vogue in the 1950s in response to the needs of boomers ' parents			0
those mutated into ' vans ' to accommodate ' @entity231 ' boomers in their thirties and forties and then into ' suvs ' for boomers as empty nesters , many going through ' mid-life crisis , ' " @entity202 wrote in a 2000 paper , " the @entity238			0
" in this way , boomers essentially created the idea of pop culture and fed its symbiotic relationship with mass marketing and consumerism , said @entity246 , a consultant who runs the website @entity248 , a digest of the weekly zeitgeist back to 1950			1
" the buying power of that generation set pop culture in motion			1
if you look back into the ' 50s , you can see where teen buying power got bigger and bigger and created pop culture : younger - skewing movies and television , rock and roll , pop rock , what we call soul music , " he said			1
" the baby boomers really started the pop culture trend and it had to do with buying power , and as we 've grown into the work force , we 've kept creating those trends			1
who were the first to buy records , then cds , then computers ? " despite @entity275 and @entity276 , the boomers ca n't take all the credit for the advent of the internet age , but they 've been fast learners of how to leverage its benefits			1
@entity284 history professor and @entity286 resident historian @entity285 , who wrote the book " @entity288 , " said technology will continue to play a big role in boomers ' retirement years			2
" people with specific skills will use the @entity295 to take advantage of the breakup of hierarchies in the economy and remain involved in their fields , be it through consulting or using social media to find professional communities or networking groups , " @entity285 said			0
" many boomers have a desire to stay involved and connected ; they 're not going to give in to the dictates of age and accept the older model			1
they 're going to find ways to stay socially , intellectually and physically active			0

boomers are the reason for projections of 88.5 million @entity33 65 and older by 2050
they 've *redefined* each stage of life ; retirement and aging will be no different
boomers will still affect pop culture as they age , too
