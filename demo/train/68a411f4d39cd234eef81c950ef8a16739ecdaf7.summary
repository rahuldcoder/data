-- so there was @entity2 , leaning back in his chair during an exclusive @entity0 interview in the clubhouse of an @entity7 golf club , and the former slugger of the @entity9 was fretting over the spot			1
what 's going to happen to the spot , he said , raising his eyebrows ? it 's the spot that was visited on april 8 , 1974 , by a baseball representing the 715th home run of his career			1
just like that , @entity20 's record was history			1
so is the spot -- almost			0
for now , the spot is preserved in a parking lot that once was @entity26 , where @entity2 sealed his immortality with his high - arching blast over the fence in left - center field			1
the spot is surrounded by part of the old ballpark 's outfield wall , and high above the spot is a large baseball - shaped placard with the inscription : @entity2 , home run , 715 , april 8 , 1974			1
the whole scene is illuminated by lights			0
as a result , those traveling across the street to the @entity9 ' current place of @entity45 can see the spot as they either walk through or drive by the parking lot at night			1
" i 'd hate for that mark to be destroyed , " said @entity2 , shaking his head while looking visibly distraught			2
" in fact , i 've gone out there with several people and taken pictures at that spot			0
" that spot is among the places in the universe that should remain as unmolested as possible for eternity			0
what @entity2 did 40 years ago tuesday with a flick of his quick wrists was as much for society as it was for baseball			1
just 27 years after @entity70 broke the game 's color barrier , @entity2 was a black man from @entity73 , @entity74 , shattering the most sacred of records , not only for baseball , but for sports			1
the old mark belonged to a white man who was so beloved that he is credited with helping to save the game during the 1920s			0
chasing @entity20 's ghost was challenging enough , but @entity2 also had to battle a slew of hate mail and death threats			1
he succeeded , and for proof , there is the spot , at least for the moment			0
the @entity9 plan to move from @entity45 to a northern suburb called @entity91 , @entity92 , at the start of the 2017 season			1
they will take the statue of @entity2 with them , because they can rip it from the ground in front of @entity45 and carry it to their dream land			2
the @entity9 ca n't move the spot , though			2
@entity7 mayor : cost too high to keep @entity9 so there was @entity2 , contemplating the spot 's future after he used his famously rich voice to discuss nearly everything and everybody he encountered during his 80 years on @entity109 , and he did so with passion			1
@entity2 on @entity70 : " of course , back then ( when i was a youngster ) , my mother expected me to go to school , but i had read the @entity113 were going to play an exhibition game in @entity73			2
@entity70 was speaking at a drugstore and i said , ' i 'm not going to get this opportunity again , so i better take my chances and listen to @entity70 now			0
' little did i know , i got front row seats , and next to me was my father			0
it was worth it , and i do n't need to tell you what happened after that ( a spanking ) ! but it was worth it			0
( @entity70 ) was my hero , always had been and not only because the baseball player he was , but for the person he was			0
" still , despite @entity2 adding that he felt an obligation to become the new @entity70 as a vocal critic of baseball regarding diversity after @entity70 's death in 1972 , he did n't make that the most sentimental time of the interview			1
@entity2 on @entity137 , and other civil rights leaders that he often encountered in @entity7 : " the one i had the most contact with was ( @entity142 , the president of @entity143 and @entity137 's mentor )			2
he and i were very close , and every year around @entity145 , he 'd come over to my house and have a little @entity147			0
he would n't drink much , but he would just sit down and tell you some stories			0
" the same goes for @entity2 's thoughts after @entity152 flew off his @entity153			1
" when i touched first base and got almost to second base , i started thinking about : ' is n't this wonderful the fact that here i am , the third oldest child of @entity158 and @entity159 , and the two of them are sitting in the stands , watching their son play professional baseball , ' " @entity2 said			2
" ' is n't it wonderful that they could be here on this day to witness history ? ' i tell you , to this day , i do n't know how she managed to do it , but ( my mother ) got to home plate quicker than i got to home base			0
" that said , @entity2 only battled a baseball - sized lump in his throat during the interview when he discussed the spot			1
" i certainly would n't want it destroyed , " he said , with misty eyes			0
" i 'd like for it to remain there in some way			0
i 've not talked to the mayor , so i do n't know what his thoughts are on it			0
i contacted the office of @entity7 mayor @entity193 , and i got an e-mail from @entity193 praising @entity2 , especially when it comes to his endless work helping kids through his chasing the @entity198			2
then , after @entity193 said the city plans to redevelop the area around @entity45 when the @entity9 leave , @entity193 wrote , " i will do everything in my power to ensure that any development proposal considered by the @entity7 for the future of the @entity45 area maintains the integrity of this important monument to ( @entity2 's ) record - smashing 715th home run			1
" when i told him that , @entity2 just exhaled .			2
