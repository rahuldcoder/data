@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's been a life filled with the highest of highs , and the lowest of lows for tennis great @entity7			1
" i think anybody that survives the communist system , they 're pretty tough ! " @entity7 told @entity2			1
" and then being gay on top of that , that was n't helpful			0
as they say , that which does not kill you makes you stronger , so i am pretty strong			0
" this year she needed all the strength gained from her amazing life to fight breast cancer while continuing to play tennis and commentate			1
@entity26 was granted rare access to document @entity7 's treatment			1
she decided to tell her story because she wants women to take better care of themselves and get regular mammograms -- not put it off like she had			1
" i heard on february 24 , which is kind of my 9/11			0
you do n't forget the day when your life is completely changed forever			0
although i did not hear the word cancer , your biopsies ( are ) positive			2
i am like ' positive is usually good , wait a minute , that is not good , what does it mean ? ' " @entity7 said			1
she was diagnosed with the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer : ductal carcinoma in situ , or @entity46 in @entity7 's case , the news was encouraging because the cancer was isolated and had not spread to surrounding tissue			1
@entity7 underwent a successful lumpectomy to remove the cancerous cells on march 15			1
she said : " i did n't need to have chemo			0
i was out of the hospital that day so nothing to really knock me on my butt and really suffer from , so i was fortunate that i got the kind of cancer that you can control this way			2
" in true @entity7 fashion , she wasted little time			1
less than two weeks after the surgery , she competed in the 24.9 - mile cycling portion of a triathlon in @entity67 , @entity68			2
tennis legend @entity69 was n't surprised by @entity7 's approach			1
" she did n't miss a beat			0
she does n't sit around wondering or fidgeting			0
she just gets into action			0
she 's a woman of action			0
the way she played was that way and that 's how she lives her life			2
i mean , she 's still incredibly so fit in so many ways			0
" a couple of weeks after the triathlon @entity7 played an exhibition tennis match against @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85			1
@entity83 was impressed with how @entity7 coped with her diagnosis			1
" she will beat this , if anyone can beat this she can , she is strong			0
it did strike me as odd that someone so physically fit who takes such pride in her health , in her eating , and all aspects of her life , was just amazing that you realize cancer can reach anybody			2
" @entity7 is handling it so well and being such a leader about it and hopefully , obviously inspiring other women to continue to be checked , because if it can happen to @entity7 , it can happen to anybody			1
" the second part of @entity7 's cancer treatment was radiation			1
she began her treatment on may 12 at @entity110 in @entity0 , @entity1			2
her doctor , @entity111 , said : " we know that if we just do the surgery and nothing more there is a significant risk ... and by doing the whole breast radiotherapy we 're able to importantly and significantly decrease the rate of recurrence , which becomes very low after that kind of treatment			1
" @entity7 underwent radiation treatments at least four times a week over the course of six weeks			1
at first , she did n't notice much change			0
" it 's very individual , i 'm feeling nothing			0
it 's weird you lay on the table and the treatment only lasts three or four minutes you know , they organize you ... i 'm marked on my breast where the radiation goes so that you 're positioned just right on the table , " she said			1
one of the reasons @entity7 wanted to undergo treatment in @entity0 was her commitment to the @entity140			1
she was scheduled to commentate for the @entity141 and also compete in the legends doubles tournament with 1998 @entity145 champion @entity144			1
weeks three and four of her treatment coincided with the tournament			1
@entity7 would start her day at the hospital , commentate in the afternoons , and then play tennis in the evenings			1
she said : " i can work during the @entity140 and i 'll be finished just before @entity145 , so it 's like you know , lucky me , it all worked out			1
it 's like the gods were saying everything 's not perfect for you but we 're still giving you a break because i have a non-invasive form of cancer and the way the treatment worked out i was able to stay with my life , with the way i had planned it			1
" as the @entity140 was ending though , @entity7 found herself at the low point of the treatment			1
" i 'm getting a little sore and getting a little run down			0
i go upstairs , i take the steps , two stories , and i 'm getting a little more tired when i get to the top these days			0
not bad ... but overall , yeah just a little sore , sort of like a pressure on your breast , like somebody puts you in sort of a grip and does n't let go , it 's not horrible yet , we 'll see			2
" despite not feeling 100 percent , @entity7 competed in the @entity140 legends final on june 5 and won convincingly			1
she raised the trophy with @entity186 by her side			0
@entity7 was ready for a break then			1
she wanted time to herself , out of the limelight to complete her remaining two weeks of radiation			0
the @entity2 team returned on the day of her final treatment and @entity7 was more than ready to be done with this chapter of her cancer treatment			1
on june 16 , @entity7 pulled up to the hospital -- like she had done more than two dozen times before -- but this time @entity144 was with her			1
" i said to @entity7 many times i am really grateful that i have this opportunity during this difficult time to spend this time with you , not only off the court , but also on the court and be part of something that is very special , " @entity144 said			2
when the pair walked out the hospital later that day , @entity7 had the biggest smile on her face , she did a little dance , and then she tried to slide down the banister			2
" last day ! last day ! hallelujah ! we 're going to have a little party tonight to celebrate			0
it 's a different kind of celebration , but a celebration nonetheless and it was like saying to the ( machine ) : ' f * * * you , i 'm out of here ! never again			0
i 'm never going to see you again			0
' " when asked if this was a time of forward thinking or reflection , @entity7 said : " i 'll think about it , but i 'm just thankful that i caught it when i did , that i did n't wait another year and think , " oh i 'll just do that mammogram later " ... i 'll be very meticulous now about going to the doctor and getting those six month check ups and one year check ups			2
i 'm not going to let that lapse again			0
" just two days later , @entity7 was on the move again -- to @entity145			2
it 's the tournament were she won a record nine singles titles			1
she was again providing analysis for the @entity141 and competing with @entity186 for another legends crown			0
by then , @entity7 had started to feel like herself again			2
she said : " you know because it was so gradual , i did n't realize how flat i was			0
i knew i did n't feel like myself but today i feel like i hit up in another higher plateau			0
the skin is pretty sensitive on my breast but one place , the rest is pretty good , but i did n't realize that emotionally i was just so flat , you know , because it happens so gradually			0
" during @entity145 , @entity7 started feeling strong again			2
she was able to balance countless interview requests , appearances , @entity141 work -- and most importantly her time on the court			0
@entity144 said : " she needs tennis to feel good			0
@entity248 means everything to her and i asked her : ' @entity7 , do you think you 'll be playing tennis when you 're 90 or 100 ? ' she said , for sure			2
i said , ' well , if you 're still playing at 100 , i want to play with you			0
" @entity144 and @entity7 won all three of their matches to reach the final and needed only two sets to win the @entity145 legends title			1
they treated their fans to a special victory lap around the edges of court 1 -- each with one hand on the championship trophy			0
@entity7 said : " now i am happy that i sort of get to rest and take care of myself			2
i have n't really had a chance to cry			0
ever since i was diagnosed it 's been pretty much non-stop , so i 'm glad to have some time in july and august to myself and really reset the clock and re-evaluate everything			0
