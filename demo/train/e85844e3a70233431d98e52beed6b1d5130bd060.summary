" after his friday trip to the @entity25 coast to check on the oil spill , the president will go to @entity27 , @entity28 , with his family to spend time with friends			1
@entity5 will mark the monday holiday with remarks at the @entity33 , about an hour outside of @entity27			1

on @entity49 , @entity48 writes , " going to @entity8 to lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns has ... everything to do with a commander in chief who seems to not like the military showing some basic respect to the men and women , alive and dead , who have actually kept us free			1
