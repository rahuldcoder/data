-- before @entity2 , there was @entity3			1
@entity4 begat @entity2 , if only in comedic spirit			1
to understand the genius of @entity2 , an audience must look to @entity4			1
they were kindred clowns , and even as you read their names now , you wonder what jokes each comic would have conjured up seeing their surnames @entity14 , @entity16 with @entity17 @entity4 was the original master of funny characters created out of the thin air of a stage , @entity2 once pronounced			1
@entity4 could invent them with nothing more than a stick as a prop			2
@entity4 became a deity to @entity2			1
in fact , he was the " @entity28 , " as the protégé put it			2
" @entity3 is the reason i became a comedian , " @entity2 declared			1
indeed , @entity4 ' influence began in @entity2 ' childhood , when he saw how his father belly - laughed at @entity4 on television			1
@entity2 and the next generation of comics a rush of insight overwhelmed the boy named @entity2 : the way to his stern father 's heart was through imitating @entity4			1
that 's how @entity2 the prodigy was born			2
" my dad was a sweet man , but not an easy laugh , " @entity2 wrote in the @entity47 in an homage to @entity4 shortly after his death in 2013 at age 87			1
" my father 's laughter introduced me to the comedy of @entity3			2
" the father and son were watching @entity58 on " @entity59 " when @entity4 appeared as a guest , wearing a pith helmet , @entity2 recounted in the @entity47			1
" who are you ? " @entity58 asked			0
" i 'm a great white hunter , " @entity4 said in an effete voice			2
" i hunt mainly squirrels			0
" " how do you do that ? " " i aim for their little nuts			0
" @entity2 repeated this tale often			2
the moment put him on the path to become one of @entity73 's funniest and most prolific artists , until this week when he apparently ended his life at age 63			0
the epiphany of his life came in boyhood , while in front of a television screen , he said			0
" my dad and i lost it			0
seeing my father laugh like that made me think , ' who is this guy and what 's he on ? ' " @entity2 wrote in 2013			2
the symbiosis lasted throughout @entity2 ' career , except @entity2 was a far more hyperactive comic			2
pity the co-star with whom he shared a stage			0
there was no way to stop @entity2 when he was on a roll			2
@entity4 , in contrast , enjoyed a pause			2
he evoked an era before technology decimated our attention spans			0
what the two masters shared was an irrepressible mischief , delivering joke upon joke with originality and freshness that left audiences wondering , how do they do it ? " @entity109 , i called @entity3 my mentor and he immediately corrected me and said , ' please , ' he told me , ' i prefer idol , ' " @entity2 said , drawing laughter from an audience gathered for the 2008 @entity114			1
@entity2 presented the @entity115 to @entity4 at that event			1
" @entity3 is my idol , and he is a true pioneer , " @entity2 added in a rare moment of seriousness			1
it was n't the first time the mentor and the protégé shared a telecast			0
when the acolyte surpassed the master and became a bigger name in show business , he and his producers invited @entity4 to join @entity2 ' successful sitcom " @entity131 " in 1981			1
it could have made for an awkward moment : @entity4 was clearly the journeyman , in his late 50s ; @entity2 was turning 30 that year			1
after all , @entity4 was better known to the generation of @entity2 ' parents			1
@entity4 ' namesake show aired in 1956 , when @entity2 was 5			1
what would @entity138 do ? in a clever move , the show employed a role reversal			0
@entity4 emerged from an egg as a middle - aged offspring of @entity2 ' @entity131 and @entity146 's @entity145			1
the image of @entity4 as an infant born to @entity2 was an example of the two comics ' imaginative powers			1
" @entity3 's improvs on ' @entity131 ' were legendary , " @entity2 wrote in the @entity47			1
" people on the @entity155 lot would pack the sound stage on the nights we filmed him			0
... sometimes i would join in ( on his bit ) , but i felt like a kazoo player sitting in with @entity162			0
" @entity4 cast a long shadow in @entity2 ' work , comedian @entity163 said			1
" when you watch @entity2 , you can see a lot of @entity3			1
@entity2 is the first one to admit that ; he worshiped @entity3			1
he insisted that @entity3 be written in as a regular on ' @entity131			2
' they wrote him in as an overgrown child , which was perfect casting , " @entity163 wrote for @entity0 in a tribute to @entity4 shortly after his death			0
their shared backgrounds were n't all laughs , however			0
inner battles took them to the brink			0
@entity4 suffered two nervous breakdowns , in 1959 and 1961 , according to the @entity183			0
he even voluntarily spent time in a private mental institution in his early 30s			0
and , like @entity2 , @entity4 also saw uneasy moments with his father , a banker who became an alcoholic after losing everything in the @entity191 , @entity183 says			1
when in his room away from his parents , who later divorced , @entity4 invented characters to amuse himself			0
@entity4 was a manic depressive , or bipolar , and described to @entity197 in 2011 how , " i need that pain — whatever it is — to call upon it from time to time , no matter how bad it was			0
" @entity2 ' descents into the abyss are well known because he openly spoke about them			0
he was an alcoholic who suffered relapse , costing him his second of three marriages			0
he abused cocaine , and made jokes about it afterward			0
he also suffered depression -- so hard to imagine between all the laughs -- and at the time of his death , he was being treated for a severe bout that now seems more serious than he ever allowed his audiences to know			0
whatever hardships they endured , both jesters left a legacy that is unconquerable : a public court that is still laughing and a world of characters as richly pluralized as the names of @entity4 and @entity2			2
complete coverage on @entity2 @entity2 : full of talent , full of demons , full of heart			0

@entity2 became a comedian because of @entity3
as a boy , @entity2 saw how his stern father laughed at @entity4 on television
@entity2 called @entity4 his " @entity28 "
both comics enjoyed great careers -- and dark moments in their *personal* lives
