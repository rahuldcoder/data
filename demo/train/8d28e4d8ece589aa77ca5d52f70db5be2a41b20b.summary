-- @entity1 remembers the day he met @entity2			1
he also recalls when @entity2 nearly crashed a plane into his boyhood home			1
nearly 40 years after @entity2 died , @entity1 's life still crosses paths with the eccentric billionaire			1
@entity8 has found himself in the center of a dispute over @entity2 ' gigantic , bizarre wooden seaplane nicknamed the @entity13			1
this thing is arguably the world 's most famous airplane and -- at five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field -- one of the biggest on the planet			1
related : stalking the world 's biggest planes the @entity13 's home is a respected aviation museum , which is part of an investigation by the state of @entity29			1
here 's the story : in 1992 , @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity29 , struck a half - million - dollar deal with @entity34 of @entity35 to buy the legendary plane			2
@entity8 -- who represents @entity34 -- is now negotiating the plane 's final payment , which he estimates at about $ 50,000			1
for @entity8 , this is way more than everyday business			0
" this plane was a part of my life , " said @entity1 , 77			2
" i saw it being built			2
i saw it being put together			0
" unfortunately , negotiations have hit a snag			0
more on that in a minute			0
first , you got ta know about the amazing story surrounding the plane and the man who flew it			0
its official name was the @entity56			0
@entity2 called it the @entity58			1
designed to carry more than 700 troops , the @entity13 flew only once			1
in 1947 in @entity61 harbor , it grabbed about 70 feet of air for about a mile			0
@entity2 â € ” who piloted the test flight â € ” said it needed more development			1
he never let it fly again			0
was the flight a failure , as some newspapers suggested ? depends on who you ask			0
@entity2 did prove the thing could fly			1
but it was never officially certified			0
lawmakers hauled @entity2 before a congressional committee to justify the plane 's taxpayer price tag of $ 22 million			1
@entity2 pointed out that he had spent an additional $ 18 million of his own funds to develop the plane			1
fearless rogue pilot when @entity1 met @entity2 , it was n't the @entity85 - plagued , naked , bearded recluse portrayed near the end of @entity88 's " @entity87			1
" this was before that			0
this was a younger @entity2 -- the seemingly fearless , rogue pilot and entrepreneur who was hell - bent on success for his aircraft manufacturing company			1
@entity8 was then 10 years old			0
@entity2 seemed like a likable person when they met at the office of @entity1 's father -- who was @entity2 ' patent lawyer			1
" i 'd never seen a tall , lanky , guy with a @entity102 accent before , " he remembers			0
" i grew up in @entity35			0
" in july 1946 , the young @entity8 had a more memorable brush with the man when @entity2 crashed a prototype reconnaissance plane a block away from his parents ' @entity108 home			1
the boy arrived at the crash scene to see a fire , a huge column of black smoke and what was left of three damaged houses			0
no one was killed , but @entity8 saw an ambulance driver help transport a seriously injured victim			0
" that turned out to be @entity2 , " he said			1
soon , other neighborhood kids descended on the scene and started grabbing small pieces of wreckage and running off with them as souvenirs			0
@entity1 remembers police canvassing the neighborhood looking for the missing debris			0
" my brother and i were upstairs and my mother went to the front door and there were two officers from the @entity108 police department asking , ' do you have any young children in this house ? ' she yelled upstairs to us , saying , ' do you have some pieces of that airplane ? ' we said , ' no ! ' and she said , ' yes , i think you do ! bring them down here ! the police are here and they want them			0
' so we pulled this piece of metal out from underneath my brother 's bed and took it downstairs , " @entity1 recalled with a chuckle			2
" we thought that was highly unfair			0
" that same year @entity1 watched trucks roll the @entity13 down local streets from the plane 's construction site on @entity157 ' west side to @entity61			1
they " cut telephone and power lines to get this huge thing down the road			0
" @entity2 died in 1976 at age 70 , and by the early 1980s the @entity13 was forced to move out of its giant @entity61 hangar			1
the plane 's owners -- including @entity167 and the @entity169 government -- gave the plane to the @entity34			2
the transfer forestalled tax expenses and the prospect of cutting the plane into pieces for display at the @entity177 in @entity178			0
" the @entity34 's mission in this whole thing was to save the @entity13 , " said @entity1			1
the club leased the plane to a company as a tourist attraction			0
@entity13 was moved a short distance away to a spectacular seaside dome next to the moored luxury liner @entity188			1
around that time , during a celebration dinner , @entity1 arrived late to what was supposed to be an escorted tour of the plane			0
he took the liberty of exploring it alone			0
@entity1 , who also has an engineering degree and a pilot 's license , said it was like being a " kid in a candy store			2
" he wandered inside one of the aircraft 's gigantic wings , amazed at the plane 's engineering			2
he climbed up a set of stairs into the cockpit , daring to sit in the pilot seat where @entity2 flew the plane in 1947			1
" i noted that there were controls for the pilot , but none for the co-pilot , " @entity1 said with a chuckle			0
" yeah , @entity2 was gon na fly it			1
he did n't need any help			0
" eventually the @entity13 had to leave the dome			1
that 's when @entity34 struck a bargain with @entity222 and the behemoth was floated up the @entity224 on barges in a spectacular 138 - day moving operation to @entity29			2
now , @entity8 is piloting @entity34 's negotiations for the plane 's final payment			1
the dispute , said @entity1 , basically comes down to a payment formula and the interpretation of three words : justifiable operating expense			2
" it 's a problem of contract interpretation , " @entity1 said			2
news media reports have overstated the negotiations ' worst - case scenario , he explained			0
" we 're not interested in repossessing it			0
it would be a nightmare			0
" for its part , the museum agrees with @entity8			1
" ... both sides expect a prompt resolution of that payment , " the museum said in a statement			2
although the museum declined @entity0 's requests for an interview , the museum 's statement said the facility remains open , is financially viable and has no plans to close			1
bottom line : museum - goers -- which number around 150,000 a year -- have nothing to fear , @entity1 said			2
" the @entity13 is going to stay where it is			1
" " the museum is no danger of losing the @entity13 , " echoed @entity222 spokeswoman @entity264 in a statement			1
" it will stay at its home at the museum for visitors to enjoy for years to come			2
" but the museum faces another financial issue			2
for months the @entity222 museum , and a related organization called the captain @entity276 , have been part of an investigation by @entity29 's @entity280			1
@entity282 spokesman @entity281 said the investigation was sparked by " people who were concerned about financial transactions by @entity222			0
" the museum owner holds companies that are for - profit and some that are nonprofit			0
there have been allegations of improper transfer of funds between the two types of companies			0
the museum said it is independent , self - sufficient and nonprofit			0
@entity281 describes the probe as a " charitable activities investigation into the charity that runs the museum			2
" recently , a broker listed two of the museum 's plane exhibits -- a 1945 @entity303 for $ 250,000 and a 1928 @entity306 â € ” for $ 1.75 million			1
it 's unknown if the museum 's decision to sell the planes is linked to its financial issues			1
" the vast majority " of the museum 's aircraft exhibits , it said , " are unaffected by issues " linked to the investigation			1
@entity222 said most of the planes on display at the museum are on loan from some of the best aviation museums in the world , including the @entity324 , the @entity325 and the @entity326			2
the museum says it 's " in no danger of losing its displays from these and other sources " and it has " cooperated with the @entity280 in its review and that we are confident the @entity280 would acknowledge our cooperation and the good work we have put into addressing concerns it has raised			2
" @entity281 said a final investigation report is expected to be made public soon			2
meanwhile , @entity8 is nearing the finish line as a custodian of this aviation icon			0
during the two decades since the @entity13 deal was struck , he 's never traveled to @entity29 to see the plane			1
but , he said , who knows ? when it 's all said and done , he may fly up for a visit .			0

museum housing @entity2 ' giant seaplane is part of an investigation
museum says it 's financially viable and has no plans to close
built in the 1940s , @entity13 still has the world 's *widest* wingspan
lawyer negotiating final ownership payment : @entity13 will stay where it is
