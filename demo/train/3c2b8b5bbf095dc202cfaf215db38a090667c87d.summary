-- anti-semitism , arguably the most enduring and murderous ethnic prejudice in human history , has always adapted to the prevailing social , political and technological conditions			1
in our global age of international flows and world politics and communication , @entity5 has become global , and it is in no small measure due to digital technologies : the @entity15 and satellite television			1
anti-semitism now reaches vast parts of the world where there are no jews			0
and the people who rely most on the @entity15 , the young , are the most innocent and susceptible to believing the prejudices they come across			2
digital technology has become a game changer for @entity5 , and for prejudices and hatreds in general , including against african - americans			1
never before has prejudice toward @entity20 been so widely present around the world in places where the hated people are present and especially where they do n't even live , as a @entity33 of 24 countries reveals			1
@entity20 form .2 % of the world 's population , with the vast majority in just two countries , @entity39 and the @entity40			2
yet in @entity41 , where @entity42 and many other @entity41 slaughtered 6 million @entity20 in the @entity43 , a shocking amount of @entity5 still exists			1
across the @entity46 world there is almost uniformly poisonous anti-semitism , including instances of @entity46 leaders , imams , and ordinary people saying that @entity20 are the children of apes and pigs			1
more amazing is that in @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 , anti-semitism is widespread			1
fifty percent of @entity58 , 43 % of @entity59 , and 55 % of @entity60 surveyed by @entity33 said they had an unfavorable opinion of @entity20 , even though in @entity58 @entity20 form .05 % of the population , and in the other countries there are barely any @entity20 at all			1
even in the @entity40 , where @entity5 is lowest among major countries , according to the @entity68 's index of @entity5 , " 15 percent of @entity40 fall in the most anti-semitic cohort			2
" digital technology has critically contributed to the explosion of @entity5 in five ways : while before a person had to be personally exposed , through people or perhaps a book , to vile characterizations of @entity20 , today @entity5 is prominently available everywhere anytime -- to those seeking it out or to the innocent person just looking for information			1
typing " jew " into @entity80 or @entity81 returns a top site ( sometimes no. 2 ) called @entity84 , which is a vast emporium of anti-semitic accusations and hatred claiming 1.5 billion pages in support of its mission to defame and eliminate @entity20 and their supposed power			2
this is but one of tens of thousands of anti-semitic hate sites , which include a growing alternative to @entity98 , called @entity99 , which seeks to create ( currently in 18 languages ) an anti-semitic informational universe			0
second , while before new anti-semitic accusations and initiatives traveled slowly if at all , today they can spread like wildfire over entire regions or the world , picked up by news or community websites coursing through the @entity15 and beamed to viewers on national , regional , or international television networks			2
this can be true of blood libels such as that @entity20 harvest @entity115 organs , of alleged plots to conquer and colonize @entity117 , or -- more routinely -- false accusations of @entity39 atrocities			0
it is true of the frequent speeches by political and religious leaders urging the annihilation of @entity20			0
third , you now have for the first time international and virtual communities of anti-semitic hatred			0
through digital technology , anti-semites find validation from and communion with anti-semites elsewhere in their own countries and around the world			0
everything we know about prejudice shows that when it is shared in communities , and especially when political or religious leaders openly express hatred of a group , such bigotry is powerfully sustained and spread			2
fourth , the @entity15 and digital technology has integrated different streams of @entity5 into a global anti-semitic amalgam			1
@entity146 anti-semites adopt anti-semitic @entity148 motifs ( to win @entity149 to their cause ) , regularly depicting in speeches and political cartoons the @entity115 as the modern crucified @entity153 ! leftist anti-semites , neo-nazi anti-semites , old fashioned @entity148 anti-semites , and , of course @entity46 and @entity158 anti-semites share common cause in their demonization of @entity39			0
fifth , digital technology has also lifted all anti-semitic restraints			0
with the anonymity of the @entity15 , and with the total lack of anti-semitic inhibition coming from the @entity46 and @entity158 worlds -- its commonplace demonizing and dehumanization characterizations of @entity20 and calls for the extermination of @entity20 around the world -- what anti-semites say and see as thinkable action goes well beyond , in ferocity and murderousness , even @entity177 's profoundly anti-semitic discourse			1
not just the @entity20 of @entity39 but @entity20 everywhere are endangered			0
digital technology has transformed anti-semitism into an essential part of the substructure of prejudice around the entire world			0
to become inundated with it , all you have to do is , innocently or not , enter the word " jew " into your browser , and then start clicking			0
but this surge in @entity5 also shows the way to combating it , by using legal means and political pressure to get internet providers , social media sites and search engines to adhere to their own terms of usage , and to the laws of democratic countries -- especially forceful in @entity41 -- which prohibit hate speech			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

@entity205 : @entity15 , other technology contributing to new spread of anti-semitism
he says many sites promote hatred of @entity20 , reaching nations with very few @entity20 citizens
he says @entity33 study shows rise in @entity5 *attitudes* in @entity57 , @entity41 , @entity55 , @entity56
@entity220 : internet providers , social media , search engines must cut off hate speech
