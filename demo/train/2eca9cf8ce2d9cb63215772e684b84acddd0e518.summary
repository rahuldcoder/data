the horrific events in @entity1 and northern @entity2 have underlined again how troubled and fragmented our world is			2
religious extremism and sectarianism is fueling terrorism and widespread conflict which has forced millions in @entity10 , @entity11 and elsewhere to flee			2
aggressive nationalism and politics based on prejudice and a false view of identity is on the increase in many countries			1
@entity19 and hunger continue to take a terrible toll			1
yet we know what needs to be done , for example , to end the @entity26 disaster , halt climate change , rid our world of hunger and begin the difficult process of healing deep divisions in our societies			1
our failure is not because of a lack of knowledge or global resources but leadership and resolve -- by politicians but also throughout society			1
how we put this right must be at the heart of all discussions at @entity42 this week			1
let 's start with @entity26			2
we have known about this disease for 40 years , how deadly it is , how it is transmitted and how to prevent infection			2
yet we have lost thousands of lives already to the epidemic in @entity50 and only now have the resources , from within countries and outside , been mobilized to halt it			2
we need to learn the lessons and ensure we can move much more quickly and effectively before such deadly diseases take hold			2
the last few months have also underlined the need for big pharma to invest more into the research of diseases that occur in poorer countries			2
the extraordinary progress in tackling some of the world 's greatest killers through the development and distribution of vaccines shows what can be achieved through our collective efforts			0
second , @entity50 , with the world 's most uncultivated arable land , has the potential to help end the global food security and nutrition crisis			1
yet it fails to grow enough food even to feed its own people			0
@entity50 's governments have recognised their responsibility to put in place the policies and investments which will enable the continent 's farmers , big and small , to provide the food needed			0
they must deliver the improved infrastructure which is vital to this ambition			0
business must respond as well , particularly by giving small - holder farmers the access to new crop varieties , techniques and markets			1
the third area where leadership is absolutely crucial is the climate crisis			1
how is it possible that climate change conferences continually fail to provide the breakthrough given that the science is so clear about the threat to future generations and our planet ? in december , a global agreement must be reached in @entity1 on the framework and policies needed to halt climate change			1
political leaders need to look beyond the next electoral cycle			0
civil society has largely already understood what needs to be done			0
i believe corporations will quickly respond to the challenge as many already have			0
there can be no clearer example of where our common values must be rediscovered			0
there are welcome signs that this is , at last , beginning to be understood			0
fourthly , we know that successful peace processes are our only chance of escaping the circle of violence			0
without the resolve to address the past openly , and without leaders showing the courage to give peace commissions the independence they need , solutions will be haphazard			1
it takes courage to address the rights of victims genuinely , but it is fundamental to heal wounds permanently			0
in a world riddled with conflict , this courage will be more essential than ever			0
the international community needs to do more to support countries through this often difficult process			0
finally , there is also an urgent need to step up support for democracy and elections			0
while almost every country now votes , public faith in democracy is on the wane			0
in too many countries , political leaders manipulate the process to deny their citizens a proper voice			0
even in mature democracies , there is an increasingly widespread belief that elections change little and that the political elite serve only their only narrow interests			2
leaders in 2015 will once more have the choice between using elections to give their regimes a veneer of democratic legitimacy or ensuring a level - playing field , respecting the secrecy of the ballot and , above all , accept the result peacefully			1
last year 's successful presidential elections and peaceful hand - over of power in @entity177 , the world 's third largest democracy , even when the result was very close provided real hope for the future			1
supporting the integrity of elections in @entity50 and elsewhere will be an area , like all these challenges , i and my foundation sees as particular priorities this year			0
in times of uncertainty , it is all too easy to surrender to fear and retreat , look inward and think short - term			1
but what is urgently needed is the ability in politics but also in business and society as a whole to look beyond national borders , the next election or set of quarterly results			1
this must underpin not just discussions at @entity42 but all our actions as voters , citizens and consumers in the coming months and years			1

@entity216 : failure to deal with global issues is because of lack of leadership and resolve
*ebola* disaster , climate change and hunger are testing societies
