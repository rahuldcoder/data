when @entity2 issued just the third veto of his presidency on tuesday , of a bill allowing construction of the @entity7 , @entity0 were outraged , or at least pretended they were outraged			1
house speaker @entity8 called it a " national embarrassment , " and senate majority leader @entity10 promised a vote to override the veto , as doomed an effort as every other piece of legislation @entity0 hope to pass in the next two years			0
but maybe @entity2 was n't cruelly crushing @entity0 ' hopes for the limitless economic bounty that the pipeline would bring , as it turned @entity21 into a tar - sands - fueled paradise of high wages and economic opportunity			1
maybe he was actually doing them a favor			0
i say that because @entity0 have really gone off the deep end when it comes to the @entity7 , and they 'll be well served to move past this issue and see if they can come up with some real economic ideas that might not only appeal to the public , but could have a chance of adding momentum to the economy			1
because if you 've listened to them for the past couple of years , you 'd think that @entity21 's entire economic future depended on this one project			0
any time a @entity0 politician was asked what we should do to improve the economy , the first thing that would come out of their mouth would be , " we need to build the @entity7			1
" that 's despite the fact that even under the most optimistic assessment , @entity7 would have created 42,000 temporary jobs , and as few as 35 permanent jobs maintaining it			0
and those 42,000 included indirect jobs created by the spending on the pipeline , in every industry anyone could think of , from apparel to entertainment			0
to put it in a broader context , the @entity21 economy created 3.2 million jobs in 2014 , or 76 times as many as the temporary job number @entity7 would have created under even the most generous accounting			1
if everything went well , @entity7 could have increased the total number of jobs in the @entity21 by a grand total of three one - hundredths of one percent			2
you can believe it was a good idea , but you ca n't honestly say it would have had a meaningful impact on an economy the size of @entity21 's			2
so why did @entity0 become so invested in the @entity7 ? it is n't hard to understand			1
once environmental activists seized on the pipeline as an organizing issue , one worth fighting about not only for its own sake but also as a concrete representation of climate change ( which can sometimes seem like an abstract problem whose effects are mostly in the future ) , @entity0 felt an obligation to join the battle , fire right back and say that it was absolutely vital to the nation 's economic health			0
and of course , it meant supporting the fossil fuel industry , and the @entity0 is still the party of " @entity99 , drill ! " the longer the controversy dragged on , the more convinced @entity0 became that building the pipeline was the most important thing we could do to get @entity21 back on its feet			2
but now that the @entity7 drama is approaching its end , @entity0 are going to have to come up with a new answer to the question of what they 'd like to do to improve the economy			1
they have their old standbys — cut taxes , reduce regulations — but those are sounding rather stale at a time when people are concerned with inequality and stagnant wages			0
so perhaps now that they have no choice but to move beyond the @entity7 , they 'll come up with some creative ideas that might actually have a real impact on @entity21 ' economic lives			2
stranger things have happened .			0
