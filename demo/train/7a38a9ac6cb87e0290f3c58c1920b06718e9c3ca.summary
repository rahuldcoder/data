-- not there yet , but the future of drone flight in the @entity4 took another important step on monday			0
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) selected six research sites to help it test and map out the best way to safely bring unmanned aircraft into the heavily used @entity4 airspace			1
@entity6 administrator @entity11 said the facilities , strategically located , will work with the agency to develop standardized procedures and regulations -- elements that govern all areas of aviation			1
" with these sites , what we have is the platform to conduct broad based research considering a wide variety of different factors , and we 'll see where the research takes us as we introduce these into the national airspace system , " @entity19 told reporters			1
the six sites are : the @entity31 , the state of @entity33 , @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , the @entity38 @entity37 , @entity39 -- @entity40 , and @entity42 's research will also include a collaboration with @entity44 in @entity45			2
the @entity6 said it considered a number of factors in selecting the sites , including differences in climate and geography , available infrastructure , aviation experience , aviation traffic volume , and specific research proposals			1
it is currently working with the selected applicants to determine the airspace for conducting research , including test flights			0
@entity60 will cover safety and logistical concerns , including that drones can detect and avoid other aircraft , and that they operate safely if they lose their link to their pilot , who is at the controls in another location			0
the research will also concentrate on environmental impact of drone use , and developing pilot training and standardized regulatory requirements			0
current law requires a case - by - case certificate of authorization in order to fly an unmanned aircraft in @entity4 airspace			2
the facilities are part of a comprehensive roadmap that the @entity6 has developed at the behest of @entity86 to develop a plan to safely integrate privately operated unmanned aircraft by 2015			1
@entity19 said the @entity6 will work to get all six facilities up and running as soon as possible , but @entity86 requires at least one facility be operational within six months			2
the sites will operate until february 2017			0
unmanned aircraft systems are currently used for a variety of reasons , including border surveillance , scientific and environmental research , and to support law enforcement			1
overseas , drones have become a key counterterror tool			1
but rapidly changing technology has opened the door to privately operated drone use for recreational and commercial purposes domestically			0
not without a warrant : @entity105 bans the use of drones for law enforcement @entity109 recently announced 30 - minute package delivery system using drone - like " octocopters			1
" the @entity6 has not yet signed off on @entity109 's plans , which ceo @entity113 says he hopes to have in place by 2015			2
there also have been concerns raised in @entity86 and elsewhere over privacy issues involving expanded domestic drone use			0
@entity19 said he envisions a staged process as drone technology and usage evolves , and as " we learn a lot more about what these aircraft are , how they interact with other aircraft , and what are the things that we have to consider as we integrate them into differing airspace and climatic considerations			0
" " the important thing about today 's announcement is it provides the platform for this research to really be carried out a very large scale across the entire country , " @entity19 said .			0

the @entity6 announces sites for testing
drones are used overseas in counterterror operations
but they are also becoming more *popular* in domestic security , law enforcement
@entity6 looks to develop standards for their use in domestic airspace
