-- many of us are tempted to look backward and replay the myriad mistakes president @entity4 has made in managing the now extraordinarily obvious crisis in the @entity6			1
i 've done it , plenty of my fellow analysts do it , and now @entity4 's own @entity13 members are doing it too			1
but sunk costs are irrelevant ; the president 's mistakes are made			0
the better question is , what does he plan to do now ? the president will take to the airwaves on wednesday to announce to the nation his strategy to confront the growing threat of the @entity26 , variously known as @entity27 , @entity26 and @entity26			1
so let 's start by saying : good			0
@entity4 has evolved from suggesting @entity26 is a minor league terrorist team , to suggesting we have no strategy in place to combat this rising terrorist group			1
and now ? any strategy embraced by the @entity4 administration must begin and end with an understanding of the nature of the threat at hand			1
too many have reduced the challenge to @entity26 alone , failing to understand that the group is merely a more venomous outgrowth of a cancer now sweeping across the @entity46 world , from @entity47 to @entity48 , from @entity49 to the @entity6			1
@entity50 , its sworn affiliates , wannabes and groups such as @entity26 are taking territory as never before			1
we are rightly paying attention to the brutal beheading of two @entity58			1
but we can not ignore the forest for the trees			0
first , @entity26 itself now occupies a swath of territory across both @entity64 and @entity65 , and so the notion of a military strategy that hits @entity65 without @entity64 , helps @entity68 without @entity69 , or rescues @entity70 without @entity71 is mindless			1
to cripple @entity26 , the group must be targeted in @entity65 and @entity64 -- everywhere that it holds land			2
second , we will need allies , and those allies will need support from the @entity58 , both on the ground in the form of special operations forces and advisers , and from the air			1
they will need weapons , now			0
we can continue to parse the many faults of these groups -- the @entity68 , the @entity65 armed forces , the @entity87 and @entity69 tribes -- and simply go and fight ourselves			0
we are better ; we are more trustworthy ; we will win			0
but do we want to fight , or do we wish to empower locals on the ground to fight ? it seems an easy choice			0
third , we need to crush the @entity94 lifeline to @entity46 extremists of all stripes , highlighted just last week in the @entity97			0
the @entity98 know it and the @entity100 know it			0
indeed , everyone but the @entity58 ( and perhaps those in the pay of @entity94 ) seems well aware that the tiny tyranny has effectively been waging war on the moderates of the @entity6 for years			2
like their alleged clients in @entity26 and @entity109 , the @entity94 are small , but nastier when unopposed			2
it 's time to oppose them , and to unite the @entity112 in so doing			0
fourth , we need to kill @entity26 ' leaders			2
yes , it 's true , @entity115 is the fourth leader of what was once @entity50 in @entity65			0
when he dies , another will rise in his place			0
so what ? killing terrorist leaders is not a strategy to defeat terrorism , but it is a useful tactic to slow down momentum , reduce recruiting appeal and otherwise warn the group that it is in our sights			0
throughout the @entity6 , many are wondering why it is that @entity58 drones target terrorist leaders from @entity134 to @entity135 to @entity136 , but both @entity65 and @entity64 are no - fly zones for @entity58 terrorist - killers			2
fifth , we need to remember that @entity26 may not technically be part of @entity50 , but it is part of a larger movement that encompasses @entity50			2
as the @entity147 's @entity146 points out , if @entity26 is defeated , " @entity50 is right on its heels and would be happy to fill in any vacancies left by @entity26 in @entity65 and @entity64			2
" finally , we must remember -- and that goes double for this @entity149 -- that a strategy to defeat @entity26 and all those like it can not be part of the usual hide - the - ball game to get bad news off the front pages and then forget about the problem			1
this has n't worked well in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity158 , @entity159 or anywhere else			0
any strategy will require sustained commitment and a willingness to speak to the @entity58 people about the threat more than a few times a year			1
these are some of the elements of a strategy to begin to " degrade " and " destroy " @entity26 , as @entity4 has said he plans to do			1
but it wo n't just be @entity58 who are listening for them when @entity4 speaks on wednesday			1
the entire world , but most particularly our enemies , will be looking to see not just strategy , but determination and commitment			2
over to you , mr. president .			0

president @entity4 is right to see @entity26 as a serious threat , *writes* @entity182
any attempt to tackle @entity26 must start by fully understanding the threat , she says
we will need allies , and those allies will need support from @entity58 , @entity182 argues
@entity193 : any strategy will require sustained commitment
