editor 's note : @entity2 is the former attorney general of the @entity3			1
his commentary is part of @entity8 's @entity7 series , focusing on the @entity10 experience today			2
former @entity3 attorney general @entity2 says his worst day at work was probably better than his dad 's best			1
@entity13 ( @entity8 ) -- over the next few weeks , @entity3 recognizes what many in this country know from personal experience			1
the most admired values of the @entity10 community are the same values that sustain our nation 's greatness : sacrifice , hard work , personal initiative , dedication to family , and perseverance in the face of adversity			1
i saw these values every day in the life of my father , @entity33			1
my father was not an educated man			2
but he worked every day to help his eight children find the @entity3 dream			1
as a young man , he picked crops in the fields of @entity41 , where he met another migrant worker -- a young woman named @entity44 , who would become my mother			0
he and two of my uncles built the house in @entity49 that i grew up in -- my mother lives there still today			0
i can remember when i was a small boy playing in the field as they laid the cinder blocks for the house 's foundation			2
they nailed together the two - by - fours , hung the drywall , and hammered the composition shingles onto the roof			0
from their sweat , toil and vision arose the small two - bedroom house that became our home			0
that home is my past , but it also represents our heritage , as @entity3 who always dream and work for a better tomorrow			1
as a young boy i would ask my mother to wake me before dawn so i could eat scrambled eggs and tortillas with my father before he left for work			2
as dad and i ate breakfast together , my mother would prepare a modest lunch of beans and tortillas and carefully place them in a brown paper sack			0
i can picture my dad walking down the street to catch a ride to the construction site and me running outside and waving goodbye			0
the memories of this daily ritual burn strong in my chest as i recall this simple time , that simple food , and those deep , enduring @entity3 values of family , hard work , and sacrifice			1
those are the principles that my parents instilled in me			0
and those principles are the best heritage of our community			2
they are the values our nation reaffirms during @entity104			2
i 'm telling you this story not because there 's something so remarkable about my life , but because of how frankly unremarkable it has been in many ways			2
and that 's what is so wonderful about this great country			1
the story of @entity3 is a story of constant renewal and reaffirmation of our founding ideals and our enduring values of faith , family , and freedom			1
i have drawn on the strength of my heritage and the insights of my background to try to make @entity3 a better place for everyone			1
over the past 2 Â½ years as attorney general , i have seen crimes involving dishonesty , corruption and depravity of types i never thought possible			0
i 've seen things i did n't know man was capable of			0
but i will tell you here and now that i am still hopeful			0
because every time i see a glimmer of what the evil man can do , i see the defenders of liberty , truth , and justice who stand ready to fight it			0
i see the courage of our soldiers , sailors , @entity153 , and airmen and i am hopeful , and so very proud			0
my time in public service has had its share of difficulties , but even more moments of inspiration			1
my trips to @entity161 have been among them			0
being part of a department that plays a vital role in stopping terrorists has been a humbling experience			0
i have often said that my worst day in office was better than my father 's best day			1
my work has not been easy , but it has been unbelievably rewarding			1
because i knew that every day when i got up , i was being given a new opportunity to work for the @entity3 people			2
when i first went into public service , i told my wife , @entity175 , it would only be for a couple of years			1
it 's been longer than that , but i have truly enjoyed myself			0
and i left public service proud to know that other @entity10 will carry on the mantle of service			1
my hopes , and those of many others with stories similar to mine , are reflected in those words of the founders of this nation more than two centuries ago : " we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness			0
" those words are a simple , clear expression of the @entity3 dream			2
i believe in that dream with all my heart			0
i have lived it in a way i never would have thought possible			0
i am the son of a @entity206 cotton picker and a construction worker who never finished grade school , and i served as the attorney general of the @entity3			1
if anyone ever tries to tell you the @entity3 dream does n't exist , or that you ca n't achieve it , i hope you 'll prove them wrong			1

*hispanic* community 's values same as those that made @entity3 great
@entity2 rose to power from humble roots ; father was @entity206 cotton picker
he says public service has n't been easy but has been rewarding
