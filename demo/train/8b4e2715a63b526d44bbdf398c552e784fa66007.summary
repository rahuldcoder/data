@entity0 -- @entity2 appears to have played a key role in the emergency border bill falling apart in the @entity5			1
less than 24 hours before @entity7 leaders pulled a vote on thursday on the $ 659 million emergency measure to address the crisis provoked by a surge of migrant youth from @entity14 , the arch - conservative @entity7 senator had lobbied @entity5 allies to scrap it unless it included a provision to toughen deportation policy			1
support for the bill as written was already tenuous at best , but @entity2 held sway , for the moment anyway			1
negotiations were scheduled to run into thursday night with a @entity7 meeting set for friday morning to discuss next steps			2
still , the meddling complicated an already arduous process in both the @entity5 and the @entity30 of marshaling support to help thousands minors , many unaccompanied and still stuck in a legal limbo that is stressing immigration services			1
ground zero for the crisis is the @entity36 crossing in @entity2 's home state of @entity38			1
has his reasons @entity2 had his reasons and it was n't the first time he 's figuratively crossed the @entity42 to buck @entity7 leaders to make his case to conservative members			1
the move that heightened legislative uncertainty most likely leaves president @entity48 able to throw pretty sharp darts at @entity50			0
@entity48 's sure to blame them for doing nothing about the border crisis as @entity54 stops work for a month - long summer recess , likely leaving him to use his executive powers to do what he can in the meantime			1
even though getting a bitterly divided @entity54 to agree on a common approach on the border crisis in a midterm election year was a long shot from the start , it appears lawmakers in both parties wo n't even have the political cover as they arrive home of having voted for or against something in their own chamber			0
" the @entity48 @entity5 should put @entity2 on the payroll , " @entity73 rep. @entity73 quipped to the @entity74 following @entity2 's latest foray into @entity5 affairs			1
what was he after anyway ? @entity2 , a tea party star who may have presidential ambitions , met with @entity5 allies on wednesday night in is office where pizza was served			1
his office was n't saying much about it			0
but others who were there said he pushed them hard for a provision that would bar the @entity48 administration from expanding a policy that prevents deportation of immigrants brought to the @entity92 illegally as children			2
he urged them to oppose the emergency border bill backed by speaker @entity95 and his lieutenants unless it defunded that policy			1
@entity2 likens it to amnesty even though it does not convey legal status			0
@entity103 @entity7 rep. @entity102 said @entity2 's intervention was " not helpful			2
" " it 's kind of shocking to me that some of our members are willing to turn their voting cards over to the @entity30 or to outside groups , " @entity102 said of those following @entity2 ' lead			0
but rep. @entity113 , an @entity114 @entity73 who attended the dinner meeting with @entity2 , said the attendees did not make a pact on the @entity5 bill and denied that he twisted any arms to kill it , as @entity7 leadership aides have claimed			1
" i do n't think that would be accurate , " he told @entity1 senior congressional correspondent @entity122			0
" @entity2 's a listener			0
" remember the shutdown the scenario on thursday conjured up memories of last fall , when @entity2 led the charge against funding obamacare that helped draw @entity54 into a government shutdown			2
at the time , @entity2 rallied @entity132 allies in the @entity5 to join his dogged opposition to @entity48 's signature health law , which remains a partisan political flashpoint			1
instead of working for compromise in the days before the shutdown , @entity2 took to the @entity30 floor for 21 hours to push against @entity139			1
the shutdown lasted 16 days			0
@entity95 and other @entity7 admitted the tactic was a mistake and some , like sen. @entity143 , called it futile			0
" it was a fool 's errand to start with			0
it was never going to succeed , " @entity143 said then on @entity1 's " @entity146			0
" @entity2 placed the blame squarely on @entity148 and the @entity5 and denied his role in provoking the shutdown , despite being branded by @entity148 and even some @entity7 as the architect of the standoff			1
and then there was @entity2 and the debt ceiling			0
and the debt ceiling just months later , @entity2 again angered fellow republicans by blocking a vote to raise the nation 's borrowing authority so it could pay its bills			1
republicans quickly scuttled @entity2 's filibuster attempt , which would have forced at least 60 senators to vote in favor of raising the debt limit to avoid a @entity92 debt default			2
that would have forced some @entity7 into the awkward position of voting against the measure and being seen as responsible for another shutdown or voting for it and hurting their standing with conservatives			2
that procedural move provoked a contentious exchange between @entity2 and his @entity7 colleagues as he accused the @entity7 leadership of " trickery			2
" cautious on primaries @entity2 has since cautiously waded into primary politics this election cycle by linking up -- often quietly -- with conservative groups that are backing challengers and opposing establishment incumbents in several @entity30 primaries			2
@entity2 appeared in a @entity188 ad backing a tea party - backed candidate vying for an open @entity30 seat in june			0
and that group has poured millions of dollars supporting challenges to @entity7 incumbents , including state sen. @entity196 's contentious challenge to veteran sen. @entity197 and @entity199 's failed battle against @entity30 minority leader @entity200			0
@entity2 also penned a fundraising appeal for the @entity202 , a pac that set its sights on dethroning establishment figures ranging from @entity197 to @entity205 to @entity207 sen. @entity206			0
@entity1 's @entity122 and @entity208 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 opposed @entity5 @entity7 leaders ' border bill that was pulled from floor
the @entity38 senator *wanted* conservatives to change @entity48 immigration policy

he has expressed his support for some *anti-establishment* candidates in the primaries
