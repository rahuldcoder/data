@entity0 -- construction has started for about 600 new housing units in the @entity5 since the @entity7 settlement freeze ended late last month , the group @entity2 said thursday			1
@entity8 , the group 's director , said the @entity7 peace organization has surveyed the construction activity and will come out with a detailed report next week			1
the group has long monitored jewish settlement activity in the @entity15 territory of the @entity5			1
the settlement construction issue is threatening to scuttle the reactivated and now stalled peace talks between @entity7 and the @entity15			1
the @entity15 demanded a continuation of the settlement freeze in order to continue with the talks , and the @entity22 has urged @entity7 to stop settlement activity			1
but the @entity7 government has not continued the freeze			2
a source in the office of @entity7 prime minister @entity28 , who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak about the issue , said , " it is clear " that any " limited " construction wo n't alter " the future peace map and that there is a need to return to the negotiating table			1
" the source said a large part of the construction is in the existing settlement blocs			2
@entity40 , a @entity15 government spokesman , told @entity1 that the settlement building reports " are very alarming because it is happening on the expense of our basic rights , on our land , and because it will reflect negatively on the sincere effort that the @entity22 and the quartet members are undertaking to resume a meaningful political process , " a reference to the @entity22 , @entity49 , the @entity50 , and the @entity51			1
" we also think that this is a big challenge to the @entity22 efforts that would require doubling the pressure on @entity7 to respect the international legality and requirements of the peace process			1
" @entity59 , the chairman of the @entity60 , which represents @entity7 settlers , said life is back to normal in the @entity5			1
" in the last 10 months there was no new construction			2
after the freeze ended , private people and private contractors who already have building permits decide if they want to start building or not ; it 's their own private decision			0
most of the construction is happening in the settlement blocs			0
" former @entity22 president @entity76 , in @entity7 as part of a mission of world leaders called the @entity80 , told reporters he hopes @entity7 will halt its settlement activities long enough for the talks to resume			2
he noted that @entity15 leaders said they would n't go back to the table as long as the activity continues			1
raising the issue of what would happen if direct talks were not resumed , he said the @entity15 could pursue other options , such as asking the @entity51 for recognition of a state of @entity93 on lands seized by @entity7 during the 1967 war -- @entity96 , the @entity5 and @entity0			1
@entity22 secretary of state @entity97 said wednesday the @entity22 position on settlements is " well - known and has not changed			0
and our determination to encourage the parties to continue talking has not wavered			0
" we have no illusions about the difficulty of resolving the final status issues of borders and security , settlements and refugees , of @entity0 and water			0
and it 's no secret that we are in a difficult period			0
" at a @entity115 event for the @entity116 , @entity113 said authorities knew " there would be setbacks and struggles " when @entity15 president @entity121 and @entity28 came to @entity115 in september to relaunch direct talks			2
" i can not stand here tonight and tell you there is some magic formula that i have discovered that will break through the current impasse			0
but i can tell you we are working every day , sometimes every hour , to create the conditions for negotiations to continue and succeed , " said @entity113			0
" we are urging both sides to avoid any actions that would undermine trust or prejudice the outcomes of the talks			0
sen. @entity138 will soon return to the region for further consultations , " she added , referring to former sen. @entity138 , who is the @entity141 administration 's special @entity139 envoy			0
" we have not given up and neither have president @entity121 or prime minister @entity28			0
" the @entity116 is a nonprofit , nonpartisan group " dedicated to advocating that it is in the @entity22 national interest to promote an end to the conflict in the @entity139 through a negotiated agreement that provides for two states -- @entity7 and @entity93 -- living @entity152 in peace and security , " according to a statement on its website			2
@entity1 's @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report			0
