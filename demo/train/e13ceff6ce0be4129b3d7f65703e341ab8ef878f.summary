defense secretary @entity0 on friday outlined actions -- some under way , some in the works -- to revamp the @entity6 nuclear program , following reviews he had ordered that " found evidence of systemic problems			1
" " we must address all of the underlying problems , " @entity10 said , pointing to " sometimes insufficient resources and manpower , " among many other issues			1
an internal review pointed to a host of problems , from " inadequate " and " aging " equipment and facilities to " a culture of excessive inspections " to the blurring of the lines between accountability and perfection in the @entity27 , " according to a summary released by the @entity29			1
this report , and a separate external review , pointed to " a nuclear workforce that was dedicated , capable , and performing well in spite of challenges resulting from being understaffed , under - resourced , and reliant on an aging and fragile supporting infrastructure in an over-inspected and overly risk - averse environment , " the @entity29 summary said			1
" both reports identified serious issues with potential real world consequences if not addressed -- some of which require long term and permanent cultural and structural changes , " the @entity29 added			0
@entity10 ordered the review in january following revelations of misconduct involving officers who played a role in the nuclear program			1
the incidents included the disciplining of a general with nuclear oversight responsibilities ; his misbehavior involving alcohol and women on an overseas trip got him into hot water			1
there was also the disclosure that nearly three dozen @entity27 officers at a nuclear missile base in @entity64 were involved in cheating on a proficiency test			1
in his remarks friday , @entity10 noted that while president @entity70 's administration is moving away from reliance on nuclear weapons , that arsenal remains a key part of the @entity6 military			1
" it 's ( the @entity29 's ) highest - priority mission , " @entity10 said			0
" no other capability we have is more important			0
" military nuke officers beset by recent scandals together , the two reviews identified over 100 recommendations to improve the nation 's nuclear deterrent forces ranging for acquisition investments to leadership challenges			1
in one instance , the review panels discovered a situation where crews working on the missile fleet relied on @entity92 to deliver the copy of one wrench , needed to attach warheads to missiles , to be shared among three bases			2
@entity10 called the situation " indicative of a system that 's been allowed to kind of slowly back downhill , " but also noted the " creative and innovative " nature of the solution			0
" we now have a wrench for each location , " @entity10 said			0
" we 're going to have two wrenches for each location soon			0
" while the reviews concluded that the nation 's nuclear facilities can fulfill their overall mission , significant changes will be required in the system to ensure the safety , security and overall effectiveness of the force in the future			2
" the bottom line is that the forces are meeting the demands of the mission with dedication and determination but with such increasing difficulty that any margin of capability to meet the demands has been consumed by the @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 are paying an unsustainable price , " air force gen. @entity133 ( @entity132			0
) and @entity135 admiral @entity134 ( @entity132			0
) wrote in a letter to @entity10 in a letter accompanying their external review report			2
regarding personnel at nuclear facilities , the report found issues with accountability , morale and recognition , as well as a rapidly aging civilian workforce in some areas , and a lack of promotion opportunities for nuclear officers in the @entity27			1
the reports also found that as the nuclear infrastructure continues to age , it will be increasingly more time - consuming and expensive to sustain without additional investments			2
in his remarks , @entity10 said he expected the need for a 10 percent increase for the nation 's nuclear infrastructure in the next five budget requests each fiscal year			2
currently , the @entity29 spends in the range of $ 15 - 16 billion dollars a year @entity10 said			0
both reports call for a clarification of the leadership structure within the nuclear enterprise to reduce administrative burdens imposed on the forces , as well as a change in the " culture of micromanagement , " and improving the manner in which training and inspections are conducted			2
they come in the wake of a string of scandals over the past few years			0
in january , dozens of @entity27 officers at @entity183 in @entity64 charged with maintaining nuclear missiles , were accused of cheating or turning a blind eye to cheating on a competency test			1
that incident followed an october 2013 incident where a @entity6 general who oversaw nuclear weapons being relieved of his position following revelations of public intoxication and disrespecting his hosts during an official visit to @entity196			1
in another 2013 incident , 17 officers at @entity198 were stripped of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after their unit performed poorly on an inspection , with one officer investigated for potential compromise of nuclear launch codes			1
secretary @entity10 flew to @entity198 on friday to visit with troops and crews and explain the findings of the reports			2
@entity10 also announced he has granted the @entity27 the authority to elevate it 's @entity213 to be headed by a four - star general and to allow a three - star general to oversee the strategic deterrence and nuclear integration staff			0
that was a recommendation made by @entity27 secretary @entity219 , along with members of @entity221 earlier this year , who said the missions deserved higher level of leadership			0
" we must restore the prestige that attracted the brightest minds of the @entity229 era , so our most talented young men and women see the nuclear pathway as promising in value , " @entity10 said			0
" they will no longer be outranked by their non-nuclear counterparts , giving the nuclear @entity27 the second - to - none leadership it deserves			0
