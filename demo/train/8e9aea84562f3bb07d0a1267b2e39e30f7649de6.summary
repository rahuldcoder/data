-- a @entity2 man who is a self - proclaimed supporter of @entity3 says he 's joining the hacking ring 's purported fight against one of @entity8 's most violent drug cartels			1
@entity9 , 30 , told @entity0 that in the next two days he expects to receive thousands of e-mails naming alleged @entity12 drug gang affiliates that he 's been told were taken by hackers from a @entity8 government website			1
" it 's possible this is all a big hoax , ( but ) i 'm more involved in this because of the possibility of striking a blow against the @entity12			1
... the issue to me was more about how do we do this operation			0
i 'm intent on what we could do with the information when we release it , " @entity9 told @entity0 in a telephone interview thursday			1
the @entity29 resident , who describes himself as a former member of @entity3 and has frequently spoken publicly about his involvement in @entity3 activities , posted a @entity34 video wednesday explaining why he planned to join the effort			1
" i 've decided to support the operation , which i understand is controversial for a number of reasons			0
in this case , there are lives hanging in the balance , in that those who are identified are likely to be killed , " @entity9 says in the video , leaning back in a leather desk chair as he smokes a cigarette			1
he told @entity0 he learned about the so - called @entity46 after @entity8 members of @entity3 reached out to him in an online chat forum			1
in the video , @entity9 says he wants to help @entity8 in their effort to stop cartel violence			1
the @entity51 says more than 43,000 people have died in drug - related violence in @entity8 since december 2006 , when president @entity54 began a crackdown on cartels			0
some @entity8 have decided to take matters into their own hands , @entity9 says , doing what they can to stop the @entity12			1
is @entity8 cartel the next ' @entity3 ' target ? " it 's @entity8 themselves who started this operation , who conceived it			1
it 's not a bunch of stereotypical computer geeks sitting somewhere else in safety			0
these are people on the ground , " he says			0
the purported threat against the @entity12 began in early october with an online video of a masked man warning that the names , photographs and addresses of cartel supporters in the @entity8 state of @entity83 can be published " if necessary			1
" the video demanded the release of a member of @entity3 who had allegedly been abducted by the @entity12 in @entity83			1
a website purporting to be an official site connected with @entity3 in @entity89 said early friday the person who had been abducted had been released , " bruised ... [ but ] alive and well "			1
@entity0 could not verify that the abduction took place or that the alleged kidnap victim had been released			1
a @entity83 government spokeswoman said no such kidnapping complaint had been registered with local officials			0
this week , another video purportedly from @entity3 surfaced , vowing to continue the campaign -- but warning of the possible risks			1
" this is not a video game			0
it 's a dangerous operation that puts at risk the lives of you and your loved ones			0
do n't identify yourself as a member of @entity3			1
you should never do it , but even less right now , " a masked man in that video says			0
it 's unclear whether @entity3 is behind either online video , or what the organization plans to do			1
the hacking group has no clear leader and no central official website			2
the website claiming to be an official site connected with @entity3 in @entity89 also said friday that no information on the @entity12 would be released -- for now			1
" a message has been sent to us , that if @entity3 reveals a name related with the cartel , the family of the kidnapped @entity3 member will suffer the consequences , for every cartel name that is revealed , 10 people will be put to death			2
... the collective @entity3 has decided by consensus that the information that we have available will not be revealed for the time being , now that we understand that we can not avoid the threats that involve innocent civilians that do n't have anything to do with our actions , " the site said			1
but other online posts -- which @entity0 was also able to independently verify -- have said the operation is moving forward			0
" looking over the forums of @entity3 discussions , it is clear that there has been disagreement over whether or not to pursue and publicize information on the cartels , " @entity145 , a tactical analyst for the @entity147 global intelligence firm , wrote in an e-mail to @entity0 thursday night			1
" many @entity3 members seem to be aware of the threat that the @entity8 cartels pose and seem disinclined to risk the consequences of incurring the cartels ' wrath			2
" earlier thursday , a security analysis from the intelligence firm said it seemed likely that some members of the organization would move forward with the purported plan			1
" @entity3 ' collective nature means activists can select the actions they participate in , including @entity171			2
it would only take one dedicated individual to continue the operation , " the analysis said			0
@entity9 , the @entity2 man , said he planned to use a computer database to methodically sift through the e-mails he receives , verify them with the help of an experienced journalist and a cartel expert and then possibly release names -- or entire e-mails -- in small batches over time			1
" if we have 100 names , we 'll release 30 or 40 names that seem right , " he told @entity0			0
@entity9 's online video -- which showed his face and was posted under his own name -- is notably different than many anonymous posts , which commonly feature men in @entity193 masks			2
he told @entity0 thursday that he was not afraid to come forward			0
" i do n't feel i should be			0
i should have the right and the ability as someone who is a fairly public person to work to @entity198 criminals in a foreign country without having to worry about being murdered , " he said			0
@entity9 also said he had weighed the possibility of wrongly identifying someone , or causing killings			2
" both my grandfathers were bombers in @entity204 ( and ) they killed innocent people and did it with less information			2
i 'm more confident about the ratio			0
i 'd be surprised if many people ( in the e-mails ) were incorrect , " he said			2
while whether -- and who -- @entity3 planned to attack remained unclear , some self - proclaimed members of the group were already declaring at least one victory			2
last week and this week a former @entity8 state prosecutor 's website was apparently hacked , with bold letters stating he " is @entity219			0
" late thursday night , the website featured a picture of a @entity224 offering and the words , " @entity46 continues			0
" in the past few years , @entity3 has taken credit for disrupting a number of prominent websites , including those of @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and the @entity233			2
in september , the group claimed it was targeting the @entity8 government , launching attacks on a range of official websites , including those of @entity8 's defense and public safety ministries			0
the @entity12 started with deserters from the @entity243 , and quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as the armed branch of @entity8 's @entity248 cartel			2
it split off into a separate drug - trafficking organization last year			0
in recent months , the @entity251 state of @entity83 has become a frequent site of clashes between armed groups as drug - related violence grows			0
in september , 35 bodies were abandoned in a roadway during rush - hour traffic in a popular tourist area there , two days before a meeting of high - ranking state prosecutors and judges			0
@entity0 's @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report .			0
