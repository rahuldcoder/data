-- an overcompetitive parent gets into an argument with a stubborn coach because he thinks his child is n't getting enough playing time -- it 's a familiar scene on youth sports fields across @entity8			1
one critic of the @entity11 plan said giving parents a outlet for petty complaints " opens up a can of worms			1
" now , a @entity11 senator wants the state to step in and create a formal outlet for the " concerns and objections " some parents have			1
@entity23 sen. @entity22 introduced a bill that would create a youth sports oversight council on the state level			1
the council would act as mediator in disputes between parents of youth athletes and sports officials			1
in answer to critics , @entity22 said friday that the notion the bill would mean " big brother " could begin to oversee youth sports is a misconception			1
the bill cites the need for a third party to step in at times , stating that " parents lack a proper outlet to share concerns and objections about youth sports			1
" but the parents are the biggest problem , said @entity52 , general manager and owner of @entity55 youth sports program in @entity56 , @entity11			1
" they are crazy , especially in @entity11			2
the kids on the court are scared because the parents are yelling and screaming , " @entity52 said			0
but the answer , he said , is not to create a council that " makes decisions we can deal with ourselves			2
" a similar council exists in @entity65 , @entity66 -- run by the town , not the state			1
" it kind of surprises me that [ @entity11 would ] do it on such a large level like that , " said @entity69 , president of the @entity70			2
@entity65 's council is made up of representatives from the town 's 11 sports leagues			1
@entity22 's bill states that at least four of the members of the state council would be regional youth sports representatives			1
he said the council is needed because right now there is no place to go to resolve disputes			2
" there 's no place right now to bring a case forward and have a third party take a look at it , " he said			0
under the bill , @entity93 gov. @entity93 would appoint seven volunteers -- approved by the @entity96 and @entity97 -- to sit on a panel called the @entity99			0
@entity22 said the seven - member council would n't be made up of politicians , but ex-coaches , ex-officials and ex-athletic directors			0
some adults involved in youth sports are n't happy about it			2
one blogger posted concerns on the web site of a @entity11 newspaper , the @entity112			2
" hey @entity113 : what do you do , [ lie ] in bed and think to yourself -- ' what have n't me and my cronies either screwed up , bankrupted or embarrassed yet ? hmmmm ... have n't touched @entity121 yet			0
' do me a favor -- and i ask this as a coach and a parent -- stay the hell away from my field ! ! ! ! " wrote the blogger			0
others think the government should " concentrate on the state			0
" @entity132 of the @entity55 program said giving parents a place to do petty complaining only " opens up a can of worms			1
" he said the council just " sounds like another way to take power away from our programs -- they have enough [ power ]			0
" the governor has not taken a position on the legislation and will not until he reviews the bill , press secretary @entity149 said friday			0
she added , however , that " there appears to be some vague language and constitutional issues			0
" the bill states that the volunteers on the council would be expected to " provide oversight and mediation " to youth sports programs in the state , as well as develop and adopt a process to review and address complaints			1
in addition , the council would have the authority to establish and collect fines			0
but the bill does not go into detail about how to implement the reviewing and fining processes			0
the bill , with some revisions , is scheduled to be heard by the @entity96 on wednesday			0
@entity22 hopes to have the council in place by june or july .			0
