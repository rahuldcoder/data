-- on tuesday , president @entity1 pledged $ 263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers			1
on wednesday , a grand jury declined to charge the @entity7 officer whose chokehold contributed to the death of @entity10 -- an incident captured in full on video			1
unsurprisingly , thursday brought cries of " what 's the use ? " after all , an officer walked even though there is a video of the killing			1
so , body cameras must not make any difference , right ? wrong			0
the fact is that even though the grand jury decided not to charge officer @entity25 over @entity10 's death , having a video of the incident has still had a huge impact -- without the video , the story would n't be leading the headlines , and protesters would n't have assembled to demand change			1
also , the video of @entity10 's arrest came from a cell phone , not from a police body camera			1
would @entity38 have used a banned chokehold if he knew his supervisor would be reviewing video of the arrest ? probably not			1
a body camera might therefore have saved @entity10 's life			1
people act better when they know they 're being watched -- or recorded			1
cops act better , and the people they encounter on the street are more cooperative			1
a study commissioned by the @entity52 in 2012 , for example , found that cops with body cameras were involved in far fewer use of force incidents than cops without			0
opinion : are police body cams really the answer ? that same year , i praised @entity62 ( @entity63 ) police chief @entity64 for his decision to fund and deploy body cameras for many of his officers , and the footage captured has helped me in cases i have handled			1
and , taking a broader perspective , the transparency inherent in such a program has also helped instill more trust among residents of the city			0
" the cameras help defuse some of the tensions that might come up during encounters with the public , " @entity64 said			0
" i think that 98 % of the time , cameras help improve relationships with the community			0
" we should also be careful not to draw too many conclusions about the ineffectiveness about video cameras simply because there was no indictment in @entity91			2
remember , the 23 - person grand jury in the @entity10 case saw more than just the video ; they reportedly heard from 50 witnesses and pored through 60 exhibits ( including other video ) that the rest of us have n't seen			1
it 's very possible , therefore , that while @entity38 's actions were improper , they were n't technically illegal in this case			2
and that raises what may be one of the biggest issues to come from all this -- our existing laws and police policies may be unjust			2
through our elected officials , we tell police officers when it is appropriate to use force , and we 've told police they can use physical force to make an arrest , even for misdemeanors			1
we 've also told police they can use deadly force to stop a dangerous fleeing felon			1
if we feel such standards on the use of force are unjust -- or that they are not being applied equally for all people , regardless of race -- then we need to demand that our elected leaders change these laws			2
but we can not correct injustice if we can not see it			0
@entity128 said that we " must make the injustice visible , " and that may be the real value of body cameras in policing			0
body cameras have the potential not only to expose when cops break the rules , but they will also help expose laws that are unjust			0
law enforcement , for their part , should not see body cameras as a threat , because they might well also show us that when cops have to make life or death decisions , they usually get it right			0
but that raises a point that is often lost when we are debating the actions of individual officers -- cops are not a gang of miscreants , waiting to murder and scheming to deny civil rights			2
police officers have taken on one of the most dangerous jobs in our society			1
they protect citizens from other citizens , and they face the delicate task of balancing the rights of the aggrieved with the rights of the accused			0
of course , we could make a blanket change to the laws and tell cops not to make arrests over misdemeanors			0
but if you own a business , you may quickly find that this means open season for your stock			0
and we could tell cops not to chase fleeing felons			0
but if burglars simply have to run from police to escape justice , then there will be a lot of criminals on the loose			2
finally , we can tell our police officers never to draw their weapon unless drawn upon			1
yet then we would be telling them to put their lives at even greater risk even as they are out there trying to protect ours			0
constrain police too much , and remove their ability to exercise good judgment , and the about a dozen cops left willing to do the job will be ineffective -- and every criminal will know it			2
this is n't to suggest that the @entity38 incident does n't highlight how we need better trained cops with a community - based focus of law enforcement			0
but if we are to make the changes necessary then we must also accept that making some of the changes required is expensive -- the president 's pledge of $ 263 million for 50,000 cameras , for example , is only a fraction of the more than 700,000 officers in the country			2
ultimately , we must be willing to dig deep , because if we want a free and safe society , we have to be willing to pay for it .			0
