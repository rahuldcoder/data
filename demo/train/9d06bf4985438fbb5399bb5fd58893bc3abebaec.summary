-- @entity1 believes in reinvention , and he does n't do things by half measures			1
the former " @entity10 " beat career - threatening injuries at the age of 21 to become @entity8 's first grand slam tennis champion and only world no. 1 player			1
but he shocked everyone by disappearing into early retirement in @entity13			0
after years of excessively good living , he made his top - level comeback at the age of 43 , having lost 25 kilograms in a punishing get - fit regime			1
and now , after finally putting his racket down a year or so later , with his desire to compete on court at the highest level sated again , @entity1 will focus on his family and wine - making business			1
" when i went back to @entity8 i was looking for property			1
i grew up in this area and i knew these vineyards and property and the streets around it , " he says of the @entity30 wine estate he bought off a church diocese in 2004			1
a winning partnership @entity1 teamed up with vintner @entity35 , who cultivates the eight hectares of land and put out their first joint @entity30 wine in 2005			1
" he 's a great tennis fan and i asked him if this vineyard was worth a dollar			1
he said it 's a fantastic vineyard and it 's got great soil and everything you need , " the @entity43 - born father of two told @entity0 's @entity44			1
" that 's how we started working together and that 's how he started developing the vineyard around our house			0
now it 's a beautiful area with sauvignon , burgundy and muscatel grapes			0
" it 's all about the @entity61 wines , it 's about white wines -- 85 or 90 % of our produce is white wine or white grapes			1
it 's one of the best sauvignon areas in the world			1
it 's still undiscovered here , that 's what we like about it , but i think in the next few years people are going to find out where this is			0
" @entity1 won the @entity79 in 1995 and was the world 's top - ranked player for six weeks the following year before quitting in 1999			1
it turns out he has the same passion for grapes as he did on the court			1
" it 's lovely be here and it 's lovely to be back home			0
@entity35 loves tennis and i love wine			1
it 's not my profession , it 's my passion , " says @entity1 , who also produces bottled spring water from the @entity94 area			1
" he 's such a great teacher and over the last years i 've learned so much about wine , about the culture of wine , it 's a great adventure			1
i love him as a friend and we have such a great time in the vineyards			1
" it 's hard work			0
to work a vineyard , you need a lot of guts to do that			0
to go out there and work all year , you almost feel that these people talk to the grapes			0
wine is a lifestyle and you can talk about it for ages			1
it 's a passion but it 's not something i can do on a daily basis			0
" disappearing @entity124 when @entity1 moved to @entity13 after feeling burned out by tennis , he quickly ballooned in weight to almost 100 kg. " when i lost to @entity128 on @entity129 at the @entity79 i knew this was going to be my last match and it was very emotional for me , " he recalls			1
" on the other hand it was so great to feel like , ' i do n't have to get up in the morning and practice ! ' when i went back home i threw everything i had related to tennis in the bin			1
i was so tired of playing tennis , so tired of traveling , of hotels , everything related to this sport			2
" maybe i should have just taken six months off			0
i do n't know if this was the solution but i just felt that i was ready to stop			0
" known as the @entity10 before @entity145 and @entity10 came on the scene , @entity1 won a record 12 tournaments in 1995 -- a feat that was not matched until @entity149 in 2004			1
he won 40 of his 44 career titles on clay , but was also a strong competitor on hard courts as he twice reached the semifinals of the @entity155 and made the @entity157 quarterfinals on three occasions			0
overcoming adversity it was in the @entity161 where his career almost ended in 1989 , when he was hit by a drunk driver in the car park at the event now known as the @entity166 in @entity167 , where he was due to play the final the next day			2
" coming back from two sets down ( against former @entity79 champion @entity171 ) and achieving top 10 , you 're entering the level everyone wants to be in			1
then i 'm seeing myself in hospital a couple of hours later and having a smashed knee			0
it was devastating , " @entity1 recalls			1
" but i did n't really know meant to have ligaments torn , i did n't know the consequences that people have after that			0
so i was very positive			0
i thought it was going to be a few weeks and i 'll be walking again , running again			0
but looking back it was a really , really hard time suffering from that injury			2
" we started rehab straight away and it helped me a lot			0
i stayed in a rehab center for three months , working every day			0
i knew i could n't run , but i had that touch , hitting balls and that routine i was going through , getting up , practicing , having therapy , doing weights			0
" as soon as i could walk again i was able to play pretty good tennis because it was a great chance to build up my upper body			2
i almost felt like a chicken before , really skinny			0
" the @entity10 in 1995 @entity1 won 40 consecutive matches on clay , the best run since @entity201 's 46 successive victories			1
@entity10 surpassed that mark when he won 81 in a row from 2005 - 07			2
@entity1 returned to @entity167 and beat two - time @entity79 champion @entity204 of @entity205 in the 1997 final			1
it was to be his last @entity209 title , with final defeats in @entity211 later that year and @entity212 in 1998			0
after his last outing at @entity214 , he decided to skip @entity215 -- where he is the only top - ranked player to have never won a singles match on the hallowed grass courts in @entity218			1
" i just did n't come back and then suddenly people started asking , ' where is @entity1 , why is n't he playing ? ' the press started to call me and i said , ' i 'm going on a holiday and i do n't know when i 'm going to return , ' so i never actually retired , " @entity1 explains			1
he went to @entity13 , got married and had a son -- and completely forgot about tennis			2
" i gave up everything i had in @entity227 and moved to a town north of @entity229 called @entity230			0
i was 99 kilos , i smoked two packs of cigarettes a day , " @entity1 says			1
" when we got divorced it was a time to come back home			2
it 's my secure place , my haven with my family			0
i came back here to get grounded again , and that 's also when i started to play tennis again			2
" back to basics working out up to seven hours a day , @entity1 soon trimmed down again and was able to compete on the seniors ' @entity243			1
but the desire to play at the top level burned deeply , and he started again from the bottom on the @entity249 circuit , where he found victories difficult to come by			1
" it was a completely mad decision -- but it was great , i would do it any time again			2
i had the best time in the past year and a half ... to practice , to play , to get fit , to fight these guys and not be given a game , " he says			2
" i took my car and my coach , and we were driving thousands and thousands of kilometers			0
we had to drop in our keys to get three balls and a towel -- all things that are given at the big tournaments where they pick you up with great cars and they have the hospitality , food all day , trainers , physios			0
" you go to a challenger and it 's in the middle of nowhere , there 's no sun shining for you , a little crowd of a few hundred spectators			0
okay i lost all those matches , i won a few , but it was great , it was grounding			0
" family ties @entity1 finally called it quits at the highest level at his home tournament in @entity288 in october , losing in the first round			1
" i decided to retire in @entity288 because i left the scene very quietly and never had the chance to say goodbye , " he says			0
" i was never homesick when i played before , but now when i leave , when i see my daughter and i have to pack my bags , it 's like , ' do i have to go ? ' and when i lose i want to come back , and that 's not a good sign for a professional player , you have to want to be out there			2
" i do n't want to stretch it to a limit where people think i 'm stupid what i 'm doing			0
i want to be respected for what i did			0
i do n't want to use wild - cards for players who deserve it			2
" it 's been a great honor but at the end i want to say it 's been a great time			2
i want to play a couple of senior tour events next year , but that 's the level i can play at			2
you do n't want to play tennis at 50 on a competitive level			1
" i think my family needs me more than anybody else , and tennis does n't need me anymore			2
i respect my wife a lot for taking all that in			2
she said , ' i did n't marry a tennis player , you 'd retired			0
' now it 's time to do something else			0
