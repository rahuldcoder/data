@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 tried on wedding dresses in a fancy @entity6 boutique , about 100 miles from the @entity8 , @entity1 , clinic where she gets blasted with chemotherapy once a week			1

her wish has been granted , thanks to @entity11 and flock of people she has never met			1
think of the foundation as @entity48 , but instead of trying to help desperately sick children , @entity11 assists terminally ill adults			1

" @entity58 's needs are becoming basic , " said the charity 's founder , @entity55			2
" we are getting wishes just to pay an electric bill , pay the rent , or help keep a promise to go to @entity64 to give them that memory in a time of hopelessness , doctors visits and uncertainty			1
" other dreams are simply for dying family members to be united with loved ones , last visits before last rites			1
@entity55 explains that with money tight , donors can still help without writing big checks			2
for example , people can donate frequent flier miles or hotel points			2
when corporate donors and philanthropists jump in , a @entity11 wish can turn elaborate			1
the foundation 's web site is a bulletin board of heartache looking for relief			1

their dream is a warm - weather honeymoon trip never taken			2

" i wanted him to have a trip or something to look forward to , " @entity114 said			0
" a lot of people do n't realize there are dreams for adults too			1
" the @entity129 ' dream trip is coming together with the help of @entity11 , which is hashing out some of the flight and hotel issues to @entity133			1
back in @entity1 , @entity12 's wedding is speeding toward january 24 , thanks to dozens of corporate sponsors and a wealthy @entity138 do - gooder , @entity139 , who made a big financial contribution			0
