-- nearly 2,000 miles from @entity2 , there 's a ripple effect from the earthquake that devastated the country on january 12			1
@entity7 agents have arrested 140 @entity2 men and women who have crossed the border from @entity11 into @entity12 since late january			1
many had gone to @entity11 well before the earthquake to seek asylum , and thought they could take advantage of a relaxed @entity17 policy on deporting @entity2			1
" one of the things that 's happening is that some of these individuals that have previously been either deported or ordered deported and are looking for refuge in @entity11 , have entered @entity11 illegally , are now looking to come back into the @entity17 and possibly take advantage of the temporary protected status that our government has given , " said @entity18 , acting deputy commissioner at @entity7			1
that temporary protected status allows @entity2 who were in the @entity17 at the time of the earthquake to stay longer , regardless of whether they were in the country legally or not			1
but the policy does not protect @entity2 illegally entering the country now			1
" we are going to apprehend them , " said @entity18			0
" these are people that should not have come into this country and applied for a program that they do not benefit from			0
" that message was likely lost in translation , said @entity44 , a court - appointed attorney for three @entity2 charged with illegal entry and jailed			1
" i think there 's no doubt that there was some confusion , " @entity44 said			2
" none of them have immigration lawyers , they 're relying on the word on the street and the word in the community			0
" one of the men @entity44 represents is @entity59 , whose story is not uncommon			0
@entity59 was living in the @entity2 community in @entity62 after going to @entity11 in 2008 to seek asylum			1
until then , he had been living in @entity64 with his wife and two children , now ages 6 and 2			0
@entity59 left the @entity17 after losing appeals to stay			1
his wife , @entity68 , a naturalized citizen , lives in a cramped apartment in @entity70 , @entity64 , and does n't understand why her husband ca n't join her			0
" you see , everything is a mess without him			0
nothing is working well without him , " she says			0
she says she struggles to take care of her children , but she is also getting calls from relatives in @entity2 who are desperate for help			1
it 's the reason she believes her husband tried to return to @entity64			2
he never made it far beyond the @entity11 - @entity12 border and was arrested in the early morning hours of march 21			1
because @entity59 does n't have a criminal record , his lawyer was able to reach a settlement with prosecutors			0
for now , @entity59 will be eligible to stay in the @entity17 under supervised release , checking in with immigration authorities			1
it will be up to a judge to decide if that happens			0
@entity44 expects his client will released from jail soon			2
while @entity59 will eventually face deportation , @entity44 says the goal is to return him to his family to weather their immediate personal crisis			2
" so he will have achieved his goal , but for the fact that he 's spent an awful lot of time in jail , " @entity44 said			2
" it would have been better , given what actually happened , if he had been able to come back and help sooner			0
" taking the risk of getting caught was in the cards , says @entity110 , who works as an interpreter for the @entity2 men and women who 've been arrested			1
@entity114 is a @entity2 native living in @entity116 , @entity12 , having recently graduated from @entity117			1
because she speaks @entity119 , she had signed up to be a translator and was stunned when attorneys called in february asking for help			0
since then , her phone has n't stopped ringing and she 's met with dozens of @entity2 who 've been arrested , meeting them either in prison or in court			1
" i think some thought there is a great chance i will get caught , " says @entity129			0
" i think some expected to get caught			0
i think it was get to the @entity17 at all costs , get to my family at all costs			1
" " i think that it is connected to the earthquake , " says @entity129			2
" when you lose your home , when you lose @entity2 as a whole			1
what is left ? " giving a voice to the arrested @entity2 , she said , has been tough since she is restrained in what she can do			2
@entity129 describes a common scenario with the men and women she deals with , saying , " there is that , that wish for a system that is more personal			0
could n't i just explain this to a judge ? to someone ? that i am not a criminal			0
that i have no background or criminal background			0
i am just trying to get to my family			2
is n't there someone who is going to believe that story ? and who is going to hear me ? " and there is that moment where ... i know what the attorney is going to say and i have to relate it with that same sort of calm , collected feeling , but i am also watching someone fall apart			0
