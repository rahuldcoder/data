@entity0 has been mired in political unrest , and wednesday 's decision by the @entity4 , the @entity5 and @entity6 to suspend embassy operations shows just how far the nation on the southwestern edge of the @entity10 has fallen into chaos			1
@entity0 has been without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict since @entity16 rebels seized control of key government facilities , dissolved parliament , and placed the president under house arrest			1
president @entity22 later resigned in protest			1
there are competing political interests across the troubled @entity27 nation and how they play out will have implications that reverberate around the globe			1
many would - be jihadis from the @entity31 are recruited into @entity32 through a slick @entity34 online magazine , @entity33 , that 's run out of @entity0			1
and @entity4 officials consider the @entity0 - based @entity37 the most dangerous branch of @entity32			1
with that in mind , here are the things you need to know to make sure you 're up to date on what 's happening in @entity0			2
the @entity44 cited a deteriorating security situation in the capital , @entity47 , terrorist activities and civil unrest in its travel warning for @entity0			1
" the level of instability and ongoing threats in @entity0 remain extremely concerning , " the warning said			2
" demonstrations continue to take place in various parts of the country and may quickly escalate and turn violent			2
" there 's been a political vacuum in @entity0 since @entity16 rebels rolled into @entity47			1
because of the instability , the @entity4 @entity61 had been operating with reduced staffing since september and a skeletal crew since january			1
the @entity16 are @entity65 from northern @entity0 and make up about 30 % of the population in the majority @entity68 country			2
saying they have been marginalized , they 've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade			2
in september , they marched in to the capital , @entity47 , and seized government building and its airport			1
they demanded greater political influence			2
some @entity81 diplomats allege that @entity82 , one of the few @entity65 nations , is bankrolling the @entity16 rebellion in an effort to control @entity0 's @entity87 coast on one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes			2
president @entity22 has said the @entity16 are being trained and advised by @entity93 , the @entity94 @entity65 militia			2
there 's also a third party that 's often mentioned : @entity97			0
he is @entity0 's former president , who clung to power until he was forced out two years ago in the @entity100 protests			0
the @entity16 have more recently forged an alliance with his supporters , said @entity103 , a senior analyst at @entity104			0
but politics , as we know , makes strange bedfellows			0
the alliance is fragile , she said , not least because @entity97 in the past waged military campaigns against the @entity16			0
it really depends on the part of @entity0 one lives in			0
the central government has never been terribly strong			0
the @entity16 hold sway in the north			0
but the @entity117 is a different matter			0
southern separatists are a strong political force there			0
ever since @entity124 united in 1990 , southerners not happy with the decision have long wanted to go independent again			0
then there 's @entity37 , which exerts influence over many rural areas stretching from the country 's southwest to the northeast			0
finally , the unrest in @entity0 also has provided an opening for @entity134 , which is keen to outflank @entity32 and prove itself the true defender of the faith			1
in november , @entity134 leader @entity137 called on @entity0 @entity68 to resist the @entity16			0
still , @entity134 remains a relatively small player in @entity0 compared to @entity32			0
there are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that control their territories			0
terrorists in @entity0 have reached into the @entity4			1
remember @entity145 , the " underwear bomber " who tried to blow up an @entity4 jetliner over @entity149 in 2009 ? he took his marching orders from @entity37			1
the @entity152 bombing suspects and maj. @entity153 , the @entity4 soldier who gunned down 13 people at @entity155 , @entity156 , apparently were inspired by an @entity4 - born cleric in @entity0 , @entity158			1
an @entity4 drone killed him in 2011			1
@entity160 is good for terrorists and bad for @entity81 anti-terror efforts			0
the weaker the government , the easier it will be for @entity32 to bring in people and train them for terrorism , which can be unleashed on the @entity31			0
under the old government , the @entity4 had an ally against the terrorist network			1
with the chaotic situation in @entity0 , @entity81 efforts to hunt down @entity32 are not impossible , but greatly hampered			1
@entity1 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 suspend embassy operations in @entity47
the reason : a deteriorating security situation , terrorist activities and civil unrest
