-- march 25 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 : disaster - affected areas transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : fridays are awesome ! thank you for rounding out your week with @entity0			1
i 'm @entity19 , here to pilot you through 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines			1
first up : @entity4 @entity22 @entity23 : first up , @entity25 secretary - general ban ki - moon says there are no signs of a cease - fire in @entity4			1
that announcement came yesterday , one week after the @entity30 voted to enforce a no - fly zone over @entity4			1
that 's part of the military operation that 's been firing missiles and running airstrikes			1
it 's been led by the @entity38 yesterday , there was talk of a deal that would make @entity41 , the @entity41 , the leader of the operation			1
but that was n't set in stone , and there was some doubt about it			1
one interesting point about the conflict in @entity4 is how it could affect gas prices in the @entity38 @entity4 produces about 2 percent of the world 's crude oil ; it 's not very much			1
but some stock traders are afraid that the trouble there could happen in other countries that produce more oil			1
that fear is one reason why oil prices are rising in the stock market			1
and that means gas prices are more likely to increase too , since crude oil accounts for about 65 percent of what we spend on gas			1
now , getting back to the military operation			1
@entity70 is on the ship that some of those airstrikes are launching from			1
she gives an idea of what life is like there			1
( begin video ) @entity79 , @entity79 correspondent : each night they fly , @entity81 jets off the @entity82 , bound for @entity4			1
@entity38 strike missions to take out @entity86 's air defense and attack capabilities as rebels clash with @entity86 's forces			1
@entity89 , @entity90 : it was pretty neat the next day after the first attacks , to see that the rebel forces , their morale once they saw that they had people coming to help them out			1
but it 's breaking their supply chains as well as slowing down their advance onto @entity104 by taking out their tanks and artillery			1
@entity79 : day times are about maintenance and repair , checking over these @entity111 , which had their first outing in @entity113 early tuesday morning			2
a daring rescue mission with a team of 30 @entity116 to find a @entity38 fighter pilot who ejected over eastern @entity4 after his f - 15 fighter jet suffered what the military called mechanical failure			1
the pilot 's back in the medical facilities here on board			2
his other crew member , the weapons officer , also had to eject , but landed in a completely different location			2
so , he was rescued first by rebel forces and is now back on a @entity38 air force base in northern @entity131			1
there are around 700 @entity116 on board , but this is n't a war which involves coalition ground forces			2
the @entity82 's six harrier jets taking the active role in enforcing the @entity25 - mandated no - fly zone rear admiral @entity139 , commander , @entity142 : if there are vehicles on the ground that can shoot down our aircraft which are enforcing the no - fly zone , we consider that a legal mandate to be able attack that equipment			2
@entity79 : precision targeting , 500 - pound laser - guided bombs , and the sorties continue			2
no sign here that this part of the offensive is over yet			2
@entity70 , @entity0 , on the @entity82 in the @entity159			1
( @entity160 ) violence in @entity5 @entity23 : @entity5 is the latest country to deal with the political unrest that we 've seen around the @entity164 and @entity165 recently			2
@entity5 is located between @entity166 and @entity167			2
and people there have been protesting over economic and human rights issues			2
those demonstrations have gotten violent in the past few days , with protesters and security forces fighting on the streets of at least one city			2
human rights workers say at least 34 people have been killed in the violence this week			2
and that includes a soldier who was reportedly shot because he refused to fire on the protesters			2
thousands of people came out on thursday for the funerals of that soldier and some of the other people who 've been killed			2
disaster in @entity6 @entity23 : @entity187 , the car company , might shut down some of its @entity38 manufacturing temporarily because it does n't have enough parts			1
there 's been a delay in getting those parts from @entity6 because of @entity6 's recent earthquake and tsunami			2
inside @entity6 , workers are still trying to get things stabilized at the @entity197 nuclear power plant			2
these pictures were taken inside the plant			2
two of the workers were taken to the hospital yesterday after they accidentally stepped in contaminated water			2
officials say the men could be all right if they 're quickly decontaminated			2
a @entity207 aircraft carrier is going through a similar process right now			2
@entity210 , you 're on deck			0
@entity212 , @entity0 correspondent : right now , every piece of hardware , every aircraft and every piece of machinery used to move that aircraft is on the front of the @entity220			1

you 're wondering maybe why are they all sitting around ? well , we 'll show you			0
look what 's going on back over here : water			0

and here 's another interesting fact : peanuts are not technically nuts ! that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! allergy outrage ? @entity23 : peanut allergies are pretty common			1
but in some cases , the allergic reactions can be life - threatening			0
and that 's why experts say it 's important to have a plan in place in order to avoid a potential problem			0
at one @entity287 school , the plan in place affects everyone , not just the student with the allergy			1
and as @entity290 explains , the plan is prompting protests			0

@entity297 , @entity0 national correspondent : protesters picketing outside a school in @entity300 , @entity287			1

at one point , students were also required to rinse out their mouths			0
parents debating whether the rules infringe on the rights of students and take time away from education			0
@entity330 : i guess it 's not fair for one kid to have a set of standards that the rest of the kids have to abide by			0
@entity330 : it 's protecting the safety of the child			0
everybody has the right to an education , so i do n't see what the problem is			0
@entity312 : a district administrator says the rules must be enforced because the student 's allergy is considered a disability under the @entity351			0

@entity361 @entity360 , professor of @entity363 , @entity364			0
@entity365 : it 's always necessary to have precautions for a young child who has a food allergy			0
