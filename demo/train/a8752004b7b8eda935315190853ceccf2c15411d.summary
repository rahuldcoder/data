@entity0 , @entity1 -- the unusually cold weather that struck @entity1 in january did more than damage crops and citrus trees			0
it has also caused an unprecedented number of deaths among @entity1 's beloved residents , the endangered @entity11 manatees			1
twisting and flopping in the shallow water , @entity12 probably does n't realize just how lucky she is			1
when this 3 - year - old female manatee was brought into @entity0 's @entity16 last month , she was 300 pounds underweight , unable to eat			0
her skin was covered with small white , blister - like lesions known as " @entity1 frostbite , " the result of exposure to cold temperatures			0
@entity16 is one of the three facilities in the state that provide medical treatment and a place for manatees to recover from cold stress , as well as other injuries			2
" it 's an exceptionally bad year for the manatee , " said dr. @entity31 , the zoo 's veterinarian			0
so far this year , a record 280 or more manatees have died from cold stress - related illnesses			1
that 's estimated to be 5 percent of the total population in @entity1			1
add that to last year 's record mortality rate of 429 deaths from boat strikes and other causes , and that number may be as high as 10 percent			1
@entity46 biologist @entity45 says he 's never seen anything like this before			0
the full impact of the cold weather on the manatee population is still unclear , according to @entity45 , who works for @entity1 's @entity52			0
he says that when water temperatures dip below 68 degrees @entity55 , these subtropical animals simply ca n't cope with the cold			1
last month , @entity1 's water temperatures dropped as low as the 40s			0
while manatees are round and plump like seals and other marine mammals , their fat is not designed to insulate them from the cold , @entity45 said			2
@entity11 manatees roam the warm waters of the @entity67 , and in the summer have been known to migrate as far north as the @entity68 , and as far west as @entity69			1
but those wintering in @entity1 are at the marginal edge of their habitat , and are always susceptible to the cold			0
on the other side of @entity77 , manatees have found a practical solution : hundreds gather in a canal warmed by water discharged from a @entity83 power plant			2
there , they are able to escape the cold , floating in waters that stay around 78 degrees			2
the carcasses of manatees who were n't able to find a warm water refuge have been turning up daily			1
most end up at the @entity92 's necropsy lab in @entity93			1
the lab has been busy in recent weeks , at times examining a dozen manatees a day			2
there , dr. @entity97 and her staff determine cause of death			0
it 's normally the young manatees that are most stressed by cold weather , but this year , full - size adults are dying			1
" that is a very bad sign , " she said			0
the cold water shuts down their internal systems			2
many were unable to eat ; others drowned because they were unable to breathe			0
@entity45 and @entity112 believe that this may just be the beginning			0
they fear that more manatees will die during the spring , unable to recover from the trauma of @entity1 's deep freeze .			1

@entity120 has killed at least 5 percent of @entity11 manatees this year , 280 in all
*wildlife* **official** : manatees ca n't cope when water is colder than 68 degrees
@entity126 are already endangered , and 2009 known deaths were a record 429
necropsy lab **official** says she fears more may die in spring from *lingering* effects of cold
