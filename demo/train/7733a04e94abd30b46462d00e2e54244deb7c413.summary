-- donning her signature red updo and red lipstick and polka - dotted dress , 915 @entity2 look - alikes gathered in @entity6 , @entity7 , on saturday , setting a record for the most lucys in one place at one time			1
setting the " @entity2 " record was just one part of a weekend 's worth of events celebrating the comedienne and star of the " @entity2 " show 's 100th birthday			1
especially this year , " we 've really tried to stay true to ( @entity2 's ) vision with as much comedy as we can pack into a weekend , " said @entity20 , executive director of the @entity22 @entity21			1
@entity26 and @entity27 were two of the headlining comics scheduled to perform over the event of several days in @entity6 , which also included a parade , a showcase for amateur comics and a performance by the @entity35 sketch comedy group for kids			1
now in its 20th year , the @entity37 draws diehard @entity2 fans and comedy enthusiasts from countries as far away as @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 to tour the @entity45 and @entity46 , two of the attractions at the @entity21			1
instead of simply maintaining the grounds for idol worship , though , @entity20 said her goal is to create a festival that will offer " new and contemporary comedy for years to come			2
" @entity20 's vision for the festival is one that she hopes will reflect the successful , progressive and still - relevant career that @entity2 created			1
" she was the first woman to ever be pregnant on television , " @entity20 said			2
" @entity2 was the first female head of a @entity60 studio			2
" and in her comedy , " she found a way to be clean , but still edgy			2
" she remained " independent of societal standards			0
" @entity64 has always been a weekend to celebrate @entity2 's contributions to comedy on what would have been her birthday			0
but in honor of her 100th birthday , @entity20 said a concerted marketing effort including social media was launched , and she expected anywhere between 5,000 to 10,000 people to participate in the festival			0
the increased presence will hopefully kick - start the " programmatic expansion into truly being a center for comedy , " she said			0
the festival is one of the four pillars in the center 's plan to stay more true to @entity2 's vision			0
the second pillar is developing educational programming for the comedic arts			0
@entity20 said they are in talks with colleges and universities about offering master classes and seminars in comedy			0
@entity95 three is a comedy film festival that would pay tribute to @entity22 and @entity99 's work behind the camera as producers of comedy			1
@entity20 says bringing a national @entity103 to @entity6 , @entity7 , could be the " most aggressive " of the four pillars in their vision			1
" we want @entity6 to be the @entity112 of comedy , " @entity20 said , though she acknowledges pitching @entity6 as a host city for the hall of fame as opposed to some better - known , bigger cities like @entity109 or @entity7 will likely be met with some laughter			1
and that 's just fine with her			0
" go ahead and laugh , " she said			0
" that 's the point			0
