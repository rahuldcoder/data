-- the statement : " we have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas ... " that was part of president @entity13 's appeal to continue pushing for new energy technologies during tuesday night 's @entity16 address , a line in which he also praised the expansion of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar electricity			1
there are more high - mileage gasoline and hybrid - electric vehicles on the road			0
and automakers certainly have come a long way since the days when hulking , high - powered @entity26 steel could pass anything but a filling station			1
but doubled ? @entity0 thought that claim was worthy of a road test			0
the facts : there are some impressively efficient vehicles in production these days			2
the @entity38 and @entity39 plug - in hybrids get a combined city - and - highway rating of 58 miles per gallon from the @entity41			0
an electric @entity42 gets the equivalent of 118 mpg			0
more fact checks : immigration @entity46 wind energy and back in august , the @entity13 administration issued new rules that would push automakers to make their entire fleets get comparable numbers			1
that regulation nearly doubles the mileage requirement for manufacturers , making them boost their corporate average fuel economy ( @entity58 ) from the current standard of 29.7 mpg for cars and light trucks to 54.5 mpg			1
but the automakers have until the 2025 model year to hit that goal			1
and while the average car made today is more of a gas - sipper than a guzzler , 54.5 is still a long way off : the average fuel economy of passenger vehicles sold in the @entity71 averaged 33.8 mpg as of october , up from 24.7 in 2002 and 27.1 in 2008			2
and the new rules have an escape hatch : if the industry has problems meeting the new standards , there 's a review process that could reduce the target			2
conclusion : the @entity13 administration has told automakers to double their average mileage			1
in terms of actual numbers , auto mileage is up , but most drivers still have a way to go before they can cut their fuel bills in half			0
as with a lot of things said in @entity93 , your mileage may vary .			0
