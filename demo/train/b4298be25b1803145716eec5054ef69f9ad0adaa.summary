-- the @entity1 gave final approal late thursday night to the $ 858 billion tax deal negotiated by the @entity4 and top @entity5 , sending it to president @entity6 to be signed into law			1
after a day of legislative wrangling that delayed consideration of the measure for several hours , the final vote of 277 - 148 had almost equal numbers of @entity13 and @entity5 in support			1
the package includes a two - year extension of the @entity18 - era tax cuts set to expire december 31			1
it also would extend unemployment benefits for 13 months , cut the payroll tax by 2 percentage points for a year , restore the estate tax at a lower level and continue a series of other tax breaks			2
the bill , which cleared the @entity28 81 - 19 on wednesday , passed despite strong objections from both the left and the right			0
among other things , @entity4 liberals were strongly opposed to what they argued was an excessive giveaway to the rich in the form of a lower estate tax			2
house speaker @entity39 depicted the measure as a necessary step to prevent taxes of working class @entity43 from increasing , even though it also extended lower tax rates for the wealthiest @entity43 who she said do n't need the benefit			2
" this is very difficult , " @entity39 said			0
" nobody wants taxes to go up for the middle class			0
we just do n't see why we have to give an extra tax cut to the wealthiest			0
" a procedural snag earlier thursday forced @entity4 @entity56 leaders to pull the bill from consideration over concerns they lacked support on how the debate would proceed under rules they had set			2
the @entity4 then went into indefinite recess as @entity13 seeking changes to the bill huddled with party leaders to work out a solution			1
eventually , debate resumed on a new set of rules that would allow the @entity4 to vote on a proposed change to the controversial estate tax provision , and then on the full bill itself			1
@entity6 strongly praised the @entity28 vote earlier and urged the @entity1 to quickly approve the bill			1
the @entity28 vote is " a win for @entity43 families , @entity43 businesses , and our economic recovery , " @entity6 said in a written statement			2
" as this bill moves to the @entity4 ... i hope that members from both parties can come together in a spirit of common purpose to protect @entity43 families and our economy as a whole by passing this essential economic package			1
" @entity4 @entity13 , however , repeatedly warned that they may try to change the measure , particularly the estate tax provision			1
currently , the estate tax is scheduled to return with an exemption on inheritances up to $ 1 million and tax amounts above that at a rate of 55 percent			0
under the tax package , the tax rate would be reduced to 35 percent on amounts above a $ 5 million individual exemption			1
conservatives argue that an estate tax more stringent than set by the package would , among other things , make it nearly impossible for many family - owned small businesses to be passed down from one generation to the next			2
liberals contend that a lower or nonexistent estate tax would merely benefit the wealthy while doing little to aid the economy			0
a number of @entity4 @entity13 wanted to change the estate tax to levels previously approved in a separate @entity4 bill that would exempt inheritances up to $ 3.5 million and tax amounts above that at a 45 percent rate			1
@entity39 said the change would bring in an additional $ 23 billion , and would affect only 6,600 more families than the lower rate and higher exemption in the negotiated tax deal			0
however , more than two dozen moderate @entity4 @entity13 submitted a letter to their @entity4 leadership calling for the tax package to be passed unchanged so it could go directly to @entity6 to be signed into law			1
the @entity136 decided wednesday night to allow a vote on changing the estate tax provision to the levels in the previously passed @entity4 bill			1
if approved , the changed bill would then go back to the @entity28			0
if rejected , the @entity4 would then hold a separate vote on the @entity28 version , and with approval send the bill to @entity6			1
however , the @entity4 @entity56 leadership pulled the bill thursday when it was unclear whether enough of their caucus would agree to the rules			2
republicans traditionally oppose any rules set by @entity56 leaders , even on legislation that has @entity156 support , arguing they want more time to debate and possibly make changes			0
@entity39 was seen talking to @entity13 including @entity158 and rep. @entity159 of @entity160			0
later , the group grew to include @entity4 majority leader @entity162 , @entity163 , and others			0
rep. @entity165 of @entity166 said some @entity13 wanted the rules to guarantee an up - or - down vote on the version of the bill passed by the @entity28			1
as originally structured , such a vote would occur only if the @entity4 first rejected the amended version that altered the estate tax provision			1
" we have one overriding goal here -- that every member of the @entity4 have a fair chance to express his or her view on final passage , " @entity165 said			0
at the same time , @entity13 , including @entity158 and rep. @entity182 of @entity183 , want a chance to vote on further possible changes , including replacing the payroll tax deduction with an extended " make work pay " tax credit set to expire at the end of the year , @entity182 said			1
the @entity13 also want a provision to redirect any additional revenue from their desired higher estate tax rate to pay for infrastructure investment projects , as well as a $ 250 payment to @entity196 recipients denied a " cost of living " increase this year , according to @entity182			2
" this is the last opportunity we have , " @entity182 said in explaining the last - minute push by the liberal wing			0
" we 're on record voting on a whole bunch of things that people are n't paying attention to			0
people are paying attention now and we think we need to make a strong statement			0
" however , @entity56 rep. @entity210 of @entity211 , who supports the @entity28 version , called the move by liberals to demand more changes a " mistake			0
" " it 's delaying the inevitable , " @entity210 told @entity0			0
" the @entity28 passed this thing with 81 votes			0
" in the end , the new rules only added the guaranteed vote on the full bill , while denying the other amendments sought by the @entity13			1
republicans involved in the negotiations with the @entity4 on the package have warned that any changes by the @entity4 could derail the entire proposal , causing tax rates to increase in 2011			1
" if the @entity4 @entity56 leadership decides to make partisan changes , they will ensure that every @entity43 taxpayer will see a job - killing tax hike on january 1st , " senate minority leader @entity230 , @entity231 , said in a statement monday			2
with the @entity18 tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year , @entity6 and congressional @entity13 faced a fast - approaching deadline to reach a deal			1
republicans won control of the @entity4 and reduced the @entity56 majority in the @entity28 in the new @entity245 convening in january , which would give @entity13 less leverage to negotiate after the current lame - duck session			2
@entity4 liberals were not the only ones objecting to the agreement			0
a number of conservatives , including likely 2012 @entity156 presidential candidate @entity253 , were challenging the deal because it does n't permanently extend the @entity18 tax cuts and would add to the deficit			1
@entity0 's @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity4 passes the tax package
new : the bill now goes to president @entity6 to be signed into law
the vote was delayed by @entity13 seeking changes
the measure extends @entity18 tax cuts to all , along with *jobless* benefits
