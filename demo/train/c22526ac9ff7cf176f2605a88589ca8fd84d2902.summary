editor 's note : @entity2 is professor of law and @entity4 studies at the @entity5			1
@entity6 , who has a ph.d. in sociology and a law degree from @entity10 , is the author of " manifest destinies : the making of the @entity12			2
" @entity2 says @entity14 's " wise @entity15 " comment has been taken out of context			1
( @entity17 ) -- it is likely that @entity14 will face some questions from members of the @entity21 this week about her 2001 " wise @entity15 " remark			1
in a speech at a @entity25 conference on @entity27 judges , @entity14 said , " i would hope that a wise @entity15 woman , with the richness of her experiences , would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life			1
" her comment has been lampooned on the cover of the @entity36 , where cartoonists apparently could not quite fathom a wise @entity15 judge , choosing to portray @entity14 as a @entity39 with @entity41 features			1
it has caused @entity43 and others to label her a " racist , " and it has caused even liberals to bristle			0
i was a speaker at the conference @entity14 's speech kicked off , and i would like to put her comment in context			1
entitled " raising the bar : @entity27 and @entity61 in the @entity62 and the @entity63 , " the conference brought together -- for the first time , to my knowledge -- judges , lawyers , scholars and law students to consider the state of @entity59 in the judiciary			2
by 2050 , @entity27 will be 30 percent of the @entity65 population , and yet the number of @entity27 judges remains tiny			2
the number of female @entity27 judges is even smaller ; @entity14 is one of two @entity27 women among federal appellate judges , and there are not much more than that among the hundreds of federal district judges			1
part of the impetus for the conference was to signal the potential crisis for our courts in the 21st century if we do not get more @entity27 lawyers interested in becoming judges and more appointed to the bench			0
in this context , i did not find @entity14 's comment controversial			1
as i look at the speech eight years later , i 'm struck by how measured and careful she was in making the claim			0
first , the sentence i have quoted here followed @entity14 's acknowledgement that there is no universal definition of " wise			1
" second , she presented the statement as aspirational by using the phrase " i would hope " ; she was talking as much about the ideal of diversity as its reality			0
third , she specified that she was talking not about all @entity59 and all white men but about ideal types ; she invoked a " wise " @entity27 woman who has had a particular set of life experiences and white male judges who have not " lived that life " ( suggesting that some white males could , in fact , bring a similar empathy and / or life experience to the bench )			2
fourth , she went out of her way to say that she thought this would be the case " more often than not , " rather than all the time			0
finally , in the next sentence of her speech , @entity14 went on to specify that she was addressing the dynamics of an appellate court with multiple judges ( such as the three - judge and en banc panels on which she sits as an appeals court judge and the @entity121 ) , rather than talking about a trial court context in which a single judge presides			1
she was referencing the group dynamics on a @entity65 @entity121 of nine justices who converse publicly during oral arguments and privately during conferences over cases			0
in these settings , who a judge is , in all the ways that matter , undoubtedly affects his or her own thinking about cases as well as that of the other justices			0
does anyone that doubt that justice @entity141 's identity as an @entity4 male or his experience as a civil rights lawyer shaped his judicial philosophy and influence his fellow justices some of the time ? most watchers of the @entity121 have similarly concluded that justices @entity147 and @entity149 have had a great impact on their colleagues in cases of particular interest to women , such as abortion and sex discrimination			0
ultimately , whether , holding other things constant , women of color make " better " judges than white men is an empirical question that we are unable to answer definitively any time soon , given the small numbers of minority judges			0
that inquiry itself begs the question of quality explicit in @entity14 's comment : what makes one judge better than another ? better for whom ? some political scientists have argued that the appropriate measure is essentially political : is the judge better for those who elected the president who nominated the @entity121 justice ? at the end of the day , a judge 's race and gender may have less impact on how she decides a particular case than how the larger public perceives the court on which she sits			1
in a society in which african - americans and @entity27 , in particular , report high rates of dissatisfaction and lack of faith in the courts and other criminal justice institutions , the racial and gender makeup of the judiciary has greater relevance			0
of 111 @entity121 justices , all but four have been white men			0
it 's past time the nation 's highest court looked more like the nation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : *critics* of @entity14 take her remarks out of context
she says judge carefully *hedged* comment about " wise @entity15 " judge
@entity6 : *key* merit of diversity on court is public view of judges ' *legitimacy*
