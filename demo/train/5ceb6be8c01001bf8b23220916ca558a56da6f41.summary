@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 have no chance of winning the november 6 presidential election , but the two " third - party " candidates could have an impact on who does			1
together , @entity2 of the @entity10 and @entity3 of the @entity11 are in position to siphon a few thousand votes from @entity15 @entity14 and perhaps president @entity16 in some of the handful of battleground states considered up for grabs and therefore decisive in determining the winner			1
@entity3 , a former @entity21 - turned - @entity15 congressman from @entity22 known for an anti-immigration stance and other strongly conservative policies , routinely won well over 120,000 votes in his home district in elections from 1996 to 2008			1
if he gets only 10 % of that support this time , it could be enough to swing what is currently considered a dead - even race for @entity22 's 13 electoral votes to @entity16			1
@entity2 : an uphill battle to catch a wave , win the presidency " @entity3 is a wild card , particularly in @entity22 , " said @entity36 of the @entity36 , adding " he could be a factor even if he wins only a handful of votes			1
" a similar scenario involves @entity2 , the former @entity15 governor of @entity43 , in other states considered too close to call like @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , said @entity48 , a political science professor at @entity50			1
all three states , with a combined 19 electoral votes , are known for independent - minded voters , she noted , enough of whom might be inclined to back a @entity10 instead of @entity14			2
in @entity46 , a @entity1 / @entity56 poll last month showed @entity3 winning 4 % support and @entity2 3 % , with @entity16 holding a 47 % -44 % lead over @entity14 in the state			1
based on 2008 turnout in @entity46 , the support for @entity3 and @entity2 would amount to about 67,000 votes			2
@entity64 chairman @entity63 downplayed the impact of third - party candidates earlier this month , telling @entity1 that @entity2 's candidacy was " almost a non-factor			1
" could @entity16 's struggles with white voters cost him the election ? voters " are not going to throw their vote away when we have an election here that 's about the future of @entity78 , " @entity63 said			0
" i do n't see that happening			0
" @entity1 polling shows that support for @entity16 and @entity14 changes little when third party candidates are factored into state races , said @entity1 polling director @entity84			1
" in all states @entity1 has polled so far , the minor party candidates are getting no more than 4 % of the vote , and usually closer to 1 % -2 % , " @entity84 said , noting that including them does n't change the margin between @entity16 and @entity14			1
" statistically speaking , it 's difficult to make the case that the minor party candidates are affecting the race			2
" the influence of third party challengers has dropped dramatically since @entity96 billionaire @entity95 won almost 19 % of the vote in 1992 , drawing conservative ire for harming incumbent @entity15 president @entity100 's re-election chances against @entity21 @entity101			2
eight years later , consumer activist and @entity104 candidate @entity103 got 2.8 million votes , including more than 94,000 in @entity106 that ensured @entity110 vice president @entity109 's loss to @entity15 @entity111 in the state by 537 votes			1
despite plummeting votes for third party candidates in recent elections , the tight race this year between @entity16 and @entity14 makes even fractional support for others potentially decisive in a key state , and therefore the election			1
who 's up ? check out : @entity123 " if the race is close enough , 100 votes can matter , " said @entity124 , president of the polling company @entity125			0
the fierce competition of this year 's race means fewer undecided voters and fewer people choosing a third - party option , he noted , adding : " it 's not a @entity95 year			2
" @entity3 rejects any insinuation that he seeks to play a spoiler role , saying his policies would be better for the country than those of @entity16 or @entity14			0
if he managed to win , " it would shake up @entity0 in that an average citizen would be president instead of someone that is backed by @entity143 , " he recently told @entity1			0
@entity2 depicts himself as more liberal than @entity16 on social issues and more conservative than @entity14 on fiscal issues			2
he says same - sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal , supports legalizing marijuana usage , and also says he would abolish the @entity150			0
to @entity48 , @entity2 represents a possible threat that should worry the @entity14 campaign			0
" i think you can argue that @entity2 will siphon off @entity14 votes , " she told @entity1 , arguing that hardcore conservatives who consider the former @entity155 governor to be too moderate could opt for the @entity10			1
do the math : @entity159 " if @entity45 gets closer , i think it will matter if @entity2 's in the race , " @entity48 said , noting that " 1,000 or 2,000 votes from @entity14 -- it makes a difference			1
" to counter that dynamic , @entity14 's campaign must make the argument that a vote for @entity2 is the same as voting for @entity16 , according to @entity48			1
" any time you have a third party in a very tight race and that third party candidate seems a lot more like @entity14 than he does @entity16 , then if you 're @entity14 , you have to discredit that candidate , " she said			0
however , @entity2 's campaign told @entity1 in september that some of the candidate 's support came from former @entity16 supporters in @entity45 , @entity43 and @entity46			1
by running as the @entity10 candidate , @entity2 hoped to gain the support of the relatively small but fiercely loyal following of @entity183 , the @entity96 congressman who has failed in three bids to win the @entity15 presidential nomination			0
so far , the polling suggests little progress by @entity2 in winning over @entity183 's supporters			0
an @entity192 / @entity191 / @entity190 survey earlier this month in @entity22 showed 1 % of likely voters -- about 38,000 based on the 2008 turnout in the state -- supported an unspecified candidate other than @entity16 or @entity14			0
the bulk of that support appeared to be from strongly liberal or moderate younger voters , a demographic closer to @entity16 's base			0
@entity16 could get hurt by two other minor party candidates -- @entity203 of the @entity104 and @entity204 of the @entity205 -- but both are considered far less likely to get enough support to undermine the president			0
a @entity1 / @entity56 national poll at the end of september showed @entity203 with 3 % compared to 4 % for @entity2 , while @entity3 and @entity204 had negligible support			2
however , @entity203 failed to register in @entity1 / @entity56 polls in recent weeks in @entity106 and @entity46 , and she got 1 % support in @entity214 compared to 3 % for @entity2			0
according to @entity48 , possible voter apathy by liberals disappointed with @entity16 's first term helped motivate the president 's campaign to mount a huge effort to boost turnout both in early voting and on @entity223			0
" i think they understood they had to get the people who would definitely vote for @entity16 to the polls , period , with no wavering and no indecision , " she said			0
@entity1 's @entity84 warned against assuming supporters of third party candidates changed their mind from a major party contender			1
" @entity236 supporters usually fall into that category because they do n't like the two major party candidates , " he said			0
" so in a hypothetical world in which the race were only between the two major party candidates , a lot of minor party voters would have just stayed at home			0
" the other candidates , the other debate @entity1 's @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			2

third - party candidates could impact close races in swing states
@entity1 's polling director says there is no statistical impact so far
conservative @entity3 could siphon votes from @entity14 in @entity22
*libertarian* @entity2 's campaign says it attracts @entity15 and @entity110
