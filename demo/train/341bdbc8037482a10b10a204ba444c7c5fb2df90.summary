editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1
" visit his web site for more information			0
@entity2 says @entity8 's history with @entity12 has not been a happy one			1
( @entity13 ) -- critics of president @entity15 , mostly @entity16 , have seethed that he has not been more forceful in ripping the theocratic leadership in @entity12 for their brutal handling of protesters angry with what they see as a stolen election			1
in tuesday 's press conference , the president toughened his talk , saying , " the @entity8 and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats , beatings and imprisonments of the last few days			2
" still , @entity15 's measured and calm approach has been right on target , while his critics have been totally off base			1
what these shortsighted naysayers should do is pick up a history book , or take a quick trip to @entity37 , @entity38 , and let the @entity39 tell them our own sordid past with @entity12			2
whenever @entity8 relations with @entity12 are raised , everyone seems to want to refer back to 1979 , when our embassy was overrun by militants and @entity8 were taken hostage for 444 days			1
the nation , and the world , was captivated by the drama , and many consider the affair the chief reason why president @entity54 lost to @entity55 in the 1980 presidential election			0
the @entity12 revolution of that era is what led to today 's theocratic rule in @entity12 , where the clerics hold sway over every facet of the country			1
they replaced the @entity66 , @entity67 , himself a dictator who ruled with an iron fist with the help of his @entity39 - trained death squads			0
how did he come to power ? the @entity8 helped overthrow a democratically elected government in @entity12			1
to understand the hatred of the @entity8 in @entity12 , we have to go further back than 1979 -- to 1953 , when prime minister @entity76 had the gall to care more about his country than what the @entity79 and the @entity8 wanted			1
the two superpowers were angry that he nationalized oil interests -- at the time @entity85 , now known as @entity86 , was receiving 93 percent of oil proceeds and the @entity12 were getting 7 percent			0
so with the @entity39 leading the charge , along with @entity79 intelligence , the @entity8 helped destabilize the country , blocked the importing of goods , spread leaflets around the country blasting @entity76 for a lack of leadership , and used local goons to lead protests			1
it was this effort that led to the installation of the @entity66 , who subsequently had ayatollah @entity102 exiled			0
@entity102 was a revolutionary leader who used his voice to label the @entity8 the " @entity105 " for its actions			0
nice history lesson , you might say , but what does it have to do with today ? everything			0
@entity102 rose to power by blasting the @entity8 for intervening in the affairs of @entity12			1
it was the younger voices in @entity12 who responded to his criticism of the @entity8 , and they cast their lot with a revolutionary figure rather than the @entity120 of @entity12			1
one of those young men who cared more about their own country than the interests of the @entity8 ? @entity124 , now the president of @entity12 ( a fascinating account of our sordid history with @entity12 is detailed in @entity131 's " @entity128 from @entity129 to @entity130 " )			1
president @entity15 knows that every word uttered by @entity8 leaders can be turned right around and used against the protesters who are in the streets			1
he also understands how deep resentment of the @entity8 is in @entity12 , and if the clerics can successfully get people to believe that the @entity8 is behind the protests , they have the possibility of using @entity8 as the scapegoat			2
is n't it ironic that the president 's conservative critics want him to stand up for democracy in @entity12 , when it was the @entity8 that chose to destroy democracy and install a dictator we could control more than 50 years ago ? folks , democracy can never be imported			1
if we look at our own @entity154 , the democratic movement in @entity155 and all of @entity156 , they were all driven by the people at the bottom , not the top			0
we are seeing a remarkable amount of courage in @entity12			0
the people there are tired of being treated like children , and are putting their lives on the line to demand change in the country			0
instead of inflaming tensions , the @entity8 should continue to issue tempered comments , and allow the people in the streets to drive this issue			0
this should not become a @entity8 vs. @entity12 discussion			2
if the focus remains on those demanding change in the streets of @entity12 , especially if the beatings and oppression continues -- remember @entity182 , @entity183 , and @entity184 ? -- then those who are silent in @entity12 will be silent no more , and other countries will begin to weigh in on the brutality			0
the change we desire in @entity12 will not happen with a press release or a comment by the president of the @entity8 or even a congressional resolution			2
we must show support , but from a distance			0
the @entity8 played a direct role in the mess we see in @entity12 today			2
it 's best that we shut up and allow @entity12 to determine @entity12 's fate			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity15 's critics *wrongly* accuse him of being too cautious on @entity12
he says critics do n't understand the tangled history of the @entity8 and @entity12
@entity2 : @entity8 helped oust democratically elected government in 1953
he says that coup helped lead to @entity12 revolution and years of *conflict*
