after days of caving , counter-caving , threats , u-turns , investigations and pontifications , it 's hard to know which way 's up anymore with @entity9 , " @entity10 " and @entity11			1
so , now people will go to the movie when it opens @entity15 in the @entity16 and then perhaps everyone can judge the merits of this massive incident , but let 's take a moment to speak for the only subgroup not represented in the viral debate			2
the film is about journalists , yes ? ok , let 's see what this might do for / to journalists , then			1
@entity9 chairman @entity30 ( a friend ) said this about the film to @entity7 : " first of all , we made the movie because it was -- because we thought it was a funny comedy			1
secondly , there is a long history of political satire in film			1
and this clearly falls into that realm			2
and @entity30 -- who had run @entity41 after the 1980 's @entity43 affair , when @entity44 condemned @entity43 to death for writing " @entity46 " -- admitted that @entity9 's originally pulling " @entity10 " from theaters was a blow to freedom of expression , which is uniquely dear and protected under the @entity16 @entity51			1
and after declaring @entity53 was in fact behind the massive attack , president @entity52 weighed in about setting a dangerous precedent : " we can not have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the @entity16 , " @entity52 said			1
" imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they do n't like or news reports that they do n't like			1
and that 's where we journalists come in			1
because after all the @entity73 about process , corporate profits , legal liabilities , constitutional rights , letting terrorists set the agenda -- let 's talk a little about content			2
let 's in fact spare a thought for our subset diligently working away out there in the @entity16 and around the world			2
what 's the message ? @entity90 , media writer for the @entity91 , said this about the film 's content : " ... while i am all for bold creative choices , was it really important that the head being blown up in a comedy about bungling assassins be that of an actual sitting ruler of a sovereign state ? if you want to satirize a lawless leader , there are plenty of ways to skin that cat , as @entity109 demonstrated with " @entity110 , " which skewered @entity111 in everything but name			1
" yes , and ... ? what about those bungling assassins			2
they 're journalists , right ? @entity118 meant to be ? and what message will that send to every whacked - out dictator from another planet , paranoid , control freak thug posing as president ? not to mention crazy extremist throat - slitting militant terrorists ? i do n't want to spoil the discussion - party about satire , comedy , freedom of expression , etc. , but i can tell you from personal experience the above - mentioned already think we are velvet revolutionaries at best , or @entity135 agents , military spies ... and yes , would - be assassins ! one of the most appalling acts of " journo murder " was the killing of legendary @entity142 freedom fighter @entity141 , just days before 9/11			1
imagine , two terrorists posing as journalist and cameraman get @entity10			1
they are in fact wired - up suicide bombers			2
no one thought to check them and the rest is history			2
in @entity153 , 35 journalists are in jail on specious charges , including @entity157 @entity156 of the @entity158			1
his mother told me the family has heard that a closed " trial " condemned him on " espionage - related " charges			2
it 's nonsense , of course , but this is what journalists have to endure			1
the @entity153 government seems to believe all these people are regime - change agents , through cultural subversion			0
they are terrified of a so - called @entity174 and color revolutions ever since they put down the @entity176 after the disputed 2009 elections			0
journalists were swept up in a dragnet , forced to " confess " on @entity153 state tv before being " tried " and sentenced to the infamous @entity181			1
check out @entity183 's excellent debut movie , " @entity184 , " on the case of @entity187 - @entity153 journalist @entity186			0
it 's a sobering saga of the ridiculous , kafkaesque dark reality of what it takes to be a journalist in @entity153 and other countries			0
in @entity195 , offending journalists -- not to mention anyone who vaguely looks sideways at @entity197 -- can feel the wrath of the system			1
some are arrested , some worse			0
anyone remember reporter @entity202 , shot point blank in her @entity205 apartment building in 2006 ? a staunch critic of the @entity207 and author of " @entity209 , " she was working on a series of reports about human rights abuses in @entity213 at the time of her death			0
and by the way , @entity217 this week caved in to the @entity195 government 's demand that a site for opposition politician @entity222 be taken down			0
he 's under house arrest			0
huh ? i did n't hear a peep of " @entity227 " about this serious damage to freedom of expression			1
terrible year for journalists in the @entity232 over the years , in these and many other countries , the number of journalists killed , injured , arrested and just plain shut up , has soared and continues its horrible upward trajectory			1
finally , this year , spare a thought for the victims of the madmen of today 's @entity232 : journalists @entity240 and @entity242 , aid workers @entity243 and @entity245 , were trussed up in @entity247 colors , and forced to kneel before their throats were slit so wide their heads came off			2
before their execution , they were forced to denigrate their families and their flags			0
they were forced to admit to false charges of spying and plotting			0
they were forced to give up their very dignity before they were forced to give up their lives			0
as i say , " @entity266 " might be very funny			0
i just wish it were n't yet more fodder for the deluded who see all journalists as their mortal enemy			1
we have n't mentioned what @entity11 does to offending journalists			1
their own prisoners get labor camps , torture and starvation rations , if they 're not executed			0
foreigners get traded for a whole load of publicity and who knows what else			0
but i bet journalist @entity285 is probably pleased her sister 's prison ordeal there began and ended ( in 2009 ) before this film was released			2
and furthermore i can assure you , our colleagues who have been so brutally killed and imprisoned , this year and every year , were certainly not the " easily distracted members of the @entity16 press who choose gossip " type that " @entity298 " and " newsroom " creator @entity297 railed against in his @entity9 - rage last week			0
" the wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the @entity16 press who chose gossip and schadenfreude - fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public -- a story that was developing right in front of their eyes , " @entity297 said in a statement			0
no , the ones we lost this year were brilliant , brave and full of heart , daring to keep doing the dangerous job of bringing you the truth			0
may they rest in peace			0
--- - ( @entity323 -- rip also @entity324 , after 100 years of important game - changing journalism			0
my favorite observation is by now - resigned literary editor @entity325 : " we need not be a nation of intellectuals but we must not be a nation of idiots			0

@entity331 says the fate of real journalists is *forgotten* in @entity10 furor
in the *controversial* film , journalists are sent to kill @entity338
@entity331 says many dictators already do n't trust journalists
