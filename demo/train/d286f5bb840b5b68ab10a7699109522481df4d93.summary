-- actor @entity1 accused @entity0 's @entity2 of calling him a liar in a combative , profanity - laced interview that was more remarkable for its tone than revelations surrounding his acquittal in the 2001 murder of his wife			1
@entity1 , 78 , said he agreed to appear on the show wednesday to promote his self - published memoir " @entity19 , " telling @entity2 that the book was not about his late wife , @entity16 , or their relationship			1
" i made a deal to come here and talk about anybody from the book , " @entity1 said after @entity2 asked about his feelings about the case			1
" i excused you from that deal because i thought you were going to be cool			0
now you 're trying to ( bleep ) into the ground			0
" @entity1 was acquitted in 2005 in connection with the murder of @entity16 , though that same year he was found liable for her death in a wrongful death lawsuit and ordered to pay $ 30 million			2
@entity1 subsequently filed for bankruptcy			2
when @entity2 asked about the case , including the civil suit , @entity1 demanded : " do you know why i was arrested ? " " tell me , " @entity2 said			1
" well , before you start asking questions , you should do some goddamn research , " @entity1 said			1
the actor has long maintained his innocence , raising questions about @entity16 's past and her relationships with other men as a possible motive			1
@entity16 , who also had a well publicized relationship with @entity51 's son @entity50 , was found shot in the head in @entity53 in 2001			0
the couple had married six months earlier after a paternity test revealed her child belonged to @entity1 not @entity51			2
" @entity16 had people that she burned			0
how bad i do n't know			0
did she steal everything from them ? we 'll leave that alone			0
but nobody really knew where @entity16 was			0
she had 15 id cards			0
she had 15 credit cards			0
she had different places where she lived and nobody could ever find her if they were looking for her , " @entity1 told @entity2			1
" but one day somebody opened the paper and saw that @entity16 just married @entity1 and where does @entity1 live			2
and what a couple of weeks later she was dead			0
i want you to chew on that for a bit			0
" @entity1 's use of profanity is nothing new			1
excerpts posted online from his self - published book are filled with it , especially as he describes the case that was built against him by @entity85 authorities -- and his subsequent imprisonment while waiting to stand trial			0
@entity1 accused @entity2 of insulting him by raising questions about the case			1
" nobody tells me i 'm a liar , " @entity1 said			2
at one point during one of @entity1 's tirades , @entity2 asked : " are you sane ? " later @entity1 said : " my skin is a little bit thin			1
i 've never allowed anybody to ask me the questions you 're asking			2
" but during a 2011 interview with @entity101 , the actor touched on similar subjects and gave similar answers , including accusing the talk show host of " getting a little weird now " when he asked questions about the case 's aftermath , according to a transcript of the interview posted online			1
when @entity2 raised questions about what he said he " presumed to be a very important moment " in @entity1 's life , the actor responded : " i did n't write about that life and i did n't write a book about @entity16			1
" at times , @entity1 appeared to be drawing on his acting experience , quoting lines from movies or interviews he gave years earlier			1
when @entity2 asked where @entity1 was living , the actor appeared to draw on an answer he gave in 1993 to @entity123 : " i live in an apartment			1
i told you , i 'm broke			0
i could n't buy spats for a hummingbird			0
" at other times , @entity1 took profanity - infused lines directly from his book , according to excerpts published online , delivering them almost verbatim , including an explanation of how he lost the civil suit brought by @entity16 's family			1
" they did n't win it , i lost it			0
i went up there , suicidal , to lose that , " he told @entity2			2
he went on to call @entity2 " @entity145 " or " @entity146 " during the interview , taking a line from the 1958 movie " @entity143 " that describes a man who is rich and popular			1
" you 're just like the cops			0
there 's no place to get			0
keep him in jail until he dies because everybody who 's dead is guilty , " he told @entity2 , again using language from his book			1
@entity156 -- the closest thing to an instant barometer of public opinion -- exploded with reaction			1
" to my friend @entity161 : great tv ! better you than me , " former talk show host @entity163 tweeted			2
@entity2 , himself , tweeted : " incredible interview			1
i 'd cast him in a movie with @entity168 tomorrow			0
" @entity2 also asked @entity1 about his wife 's background			1
" i think she was a con artist , yes , " @entity1 said			2
" i think she came to @entity53 to con her way into show business			0
" @entity1 also said he " did n't know here well enough to know her			2
" " i love her - well , i love you as a human being			0
you 're my brother in arms , " he told @entity2 during the interview			2
" we 're all in this thing together			0
but we were not dramatically in love or things like that			0
" @entity1 is best known for his role as a tough - talking detective in the 1970s tv show " @entity192 " and his @entity194 - nominated performance as condemned killer in the 1967 movie " in @entity197			1
