-- as @entity2 busily sorts the naughty from the nice in a kind of seasonal secular judgment day , it 's time to think back on all the promises you broke this year			1
now , as this montage of moments flits through your head , let 's home in on all those times you 've sworn you 'll totally give your buddy some good new tunes or your photos of an event			1
as the internet has made sharing files and information a snap , we 've all gotten into the habit of breezily vowing to share our digital goods			1
but you could also argue that the @entity26 has contributed to our epidemic laziness			1
( case in point : taking the " outsource my life " stunt to a higher , more penny - pinching level , @entity28 lets you hire strangers to take care of all sorts of odd jobs for you for a mere $ 5			2
) and that laziness , exacerbated by selfishness and an inability to keep a thought in your head for more than three -- hey , is that a fruitcake ? ! -- means your intended recipients know your promises to follow up are as hollow as your average hipster 's soul			1
still , if the @entity52 movies have taught us anything , it 's that eleventh - hour redemption is totally possible			2
here are a few quick tips for morphing from @entity58 's @entity57 ( pre-hauntings , of course ) into @entity2 himself			2
the empty promise : " yeah , i have epic taste in music			2
i 'll make you a mix of some stuff you should listen to			0
" ah , the mix tape			0
once a symbol of love and devotion ( after all , you had to sync up the cassette and physically hit the red button for each new track ) , now a quaint relic of the past			0
first off , whipping out the blank cd or the jump drive is technically illegal ( you 're actually not even supposed to back up legally purchased materials for yourself , according to copyright.gov )			0
an audio cd is fine if your bud is just going to whirl it around in his cd player ( yes , because we all have @entity88 these days			0
) but here are a couple of options that do n't require you to burn anything onto a disc -- or even physically see said friend again in person : one , make a @entity97 playlist and populate it with good songs			1
@entity97 is like a big free jukebox that streams tunes you handpick -- no downloading involved			1
two , pull the right songs into an @entity105 playlist and click store -- > create an @entity107 , which puts your @entity109 masterpiece onto the @entity111 for others to hear in 30 - second snippets and download en masse or song by song			0
@entity105 's new music social network service , @entity119 , just added the ability to share playlists with @entity119 friends as well			1
which would be cool , if anyone actually used @entity119			0
the empty promise : " you look so gorgeous			0
i took a ton of great photos tonight -- i 'll send them to you ! " wow , was n't that kind of you to traipse around @entity135 's long - awaited dinner party , snapping photos at every turn ! yeah , it does n't do anyone a lick of good if those photos now sit on the memory card or on your computer 's hard drive for months on end			1
and lowish - res @entity148 pictures do n't solve the problem : your hostess with the most - est obviously wants high - res images she can print , frame and display at will			0
in our completely anecdotal experience , those in the 40 - plus crowd are most conscientious about quickly sending promised snaps			0
the problem is that they almost always do it via ginormous e-mail attachments , straining your server , weighing down your inbox and sometimes making said pictures difficult to glance at quickly			0
( do n't you hate when the photo shows up in the body of the e-mail and , due to the fact that it 's about the size of a 17th century wall - hanging tapestry , you can only view a gray area of one corner ? ) @entity177 's photo - sharing service , @entity176 , solves the problem readily			1
upload some photos to a web album ( you 'll need a @entity177 @entity181 , but you are n't required to use @entity182 , luddite ) , mark it as private if you do n't want the whole @entity26 seeing it , and then share the album with " friends , " " family " and / or " coworkers " -- groups you piece together from your @entity177 contact list			1
your chosen ones can then download full size individual photos at their leisure			2
they can even add their own photos to the album -- a boon if , say , the mama - to - be wants to scoop up various attendees ' images of her baby shower			2
because apparently , you can never have enough shots of the quietly horrified crowd inspecting diapers smeared with mashed - up candy bars			0

but you could also argue the @entity26 has contributed to our epidemic laziness
