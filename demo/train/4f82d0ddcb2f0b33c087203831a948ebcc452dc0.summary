when @entity1 named his 12 meter yacht " @entity3 , " he never could have known it would bring him a real life fairytale romance			0
the divorced father - of - two had long dreamed of sailing around the globe with his very own @entity9 ; a soul - mate who shared his love of the ocean and sense of adventure			1
but finding a special woman willing to quit her job and say goodbye to her family and friends for a romantic voyage into the sunset was n't quite as straightforward as the 52 - year - old had hoped			1
like a growing number of single people across the world , @entity1 searched for love on internet dating websites			1
two years later and the sailor was still no closer to finding his seafaring sweetheart			1
it was n't until @entity1 signed up to a website catering specifically for boating enthusiasts , @entity33 , that he found the woman of his dreams -- 45 - year - old former superyacht hostess @entity34			1
the pair met at the @entity37 in south - east @entity38 , embarking on a whirlwind romance that found them engaged just six months later			0
they now plan on marrying in april , sailing around the world for their honeymoon before joining the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , the world 's largest transatlantic yachting event later in the year			1
" i loved sailing , i had my own boat , and i wanted to do it with someone who got the same excitement and pleasure out of it , " @entity1 , a former sales and marketing director at @entity49 , said			2
" and to do that , you ca n't have a partner that 's too high maintenance			2
you ca n't be with someone who needs to have a hairdryer , their nails done , a shower everyday			0
" @entity34 is so naturally beautiful she does n't need all that			0
she just loves having the wind in her hair			0
and being near the water is one of the most important things in her life			0
" launched in 2004 , @entity74 now has around 5,500 users ranging from professional skippers to hobby sailors			2
as the name suggests , most are looking for love but there are also offers of friendship , sailing trips and work opportunities			1
for those mariners constantly on the move , trying to find a partner willing to wait on land or give up everything to jump on board is one of the pitfalls of a seemingly idyllic lifestyle			1
" people who sail tend to be extremely passionate about it -- it 's a big investment , " @entity74 director @entity94 said			0
" but it can be difficult for sailors because they 're not based in one place , so when they do find someone they often have to leave them			1
" it 's a scenario former delivery captain @entity105 knows well			0
as a handsome young sailor traveling the globe in the 1970s , @entity105 had little problem meeting women willing to show him around their home town or even set sail for a brief adventure on the high seas			1
but rather than leading to a long - lasting relationship , it was more often a case of ships that pass in the night as @entity105 's nomadic lifestyle made it difficult to rest his anchor in one port for very long			2
now 64 - years - old , @entity105 's love of the water has n't waned			2
and neither has his search for a partner willing to share an unconventional life on the waves			2
" when i was 20 there was no shortage of girls who wanted to share this experience and cruise the islands , " said @entity105 , speaking from his 12 meter yacht in @entity128 , @entity129			0
" but as people get older they seem to lose that adventurous spirit -- and that 's changed my prospects			2
" @entity105 also signed up to @entity33 in the hope of finding that special lady			2
he 's still yet to find her , admitting : " it 's difficult to hook up with a @entity74 girl for a cup of coffee when i 'm still sailing all over the world			1
" online dating is big business in the @entity151 , with more than 9 million people logging on in search of love last year , according to @entity155 , a company that reviews internet dating sites			1
it 's the highest number in @entity158 , with @entity151 now claiming 1,500 of the continent 's 5,000 dating websites			1
and it 's continuing to grow , with the industry turning over Â£ 170 million ( $ 270 million ) in the @entity151 -- a 6 % rise on the previous year			1
" it 's not just people who sail , everyone has busy lives now and you do n't have the opportunity to meet new people , " @entity1 said			0
" five years ago , if someone had told me they were doing online dating my reaction would have been ' you silly idiot			1
' but as more people do it , the stigma disappears			0
" for @entity105 , the joy of yachting is still far too great to give up on the off - chance it will help him find love			1
" it 's a lifestyle i chose when i was 16 - years - old and obviously it presents its challenges , " he said			0
" but it 's beautiful out here			0
i can watch osprey and fish from my deck and manta rays dive under my boat			0
" whether he 'll one day share that beautiful view with a special lady remains to be seen			0
but then , there 's always plenty more fish in the sea .			0
