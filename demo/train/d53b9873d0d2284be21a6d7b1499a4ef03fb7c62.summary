@entity0 , @entity1 -- earlier this year , as @entity4 was driving his children to school , he turned on a local radio station and heard @entity9 sen. @entity8 talking about @entity4 's failed attempt to win re-election to @entity12 just a few months earlier			1
@entity8 was discussing the future of the @entity14 and the need for the @entity14 to maintain its traditional political base while also welcoming more libertarian - minded conservatives			0
the @entity9 senator then started citing specific data from the 2012 general election , including @entity4 's race			0
" your two @entity14 up there lost recently for @entity12 , " @entity8 said to @entity1 political reporter @entity22 in the telephone interview on @entity24			1
" they lost by four percentage points , and the libertarian in each race got 4½ percent , so really we do have to figure out a way to attract some of those voters who are voting libertarian if we want to have enough of a majority to win			0
" @entity4 , who served just one term in the @entity37 , said he was intrigued to hear @entity8 talk about his race , let alone in so much detail			0
" this was not his political adviser , " the @entity1 @entity14 said during a recent interview over breakfast			1
" but @entity4 , who is considering running for office in 2014 , said he was not shocked by the moment			0
after all , this is @entity1 , which holds the first - in - the - nation primary			2
and republicans with designs on the @entity37 are always keeping close tabs on what happens in the @entity1			2
it would just be a few months later , in may , when @entity8 would actually visit the state to headline a @entity1 @entity14 fundraiser and convene a listening session with local activists			2
it was not lost on anyone that @entity8 dug into his own political pocket and donated $ 10,000 to the state @entity14			0
despite smug dismissals of early campaign coverage by press critics , media elites and some of the potential candidates themselves , there are signs everywhere -- including @entity8 's intricate recitation of @entity1 congressional contests -- that the 2016 race for president is starting to take shape , at least among @entity14			1
take , for instance : this week 's @entity77 conference , which has been widely described as the first 2016 @entity14 presidential cattle call			1
former @entity80 gov. @entity79 , @entity82 sen. @entity81 , @entity82 gov. @entity83 , @entity80 sen. @entity84 , @entity86 rep. @entity85 , former @entity88 sen. @entity87 and @entity8 are all participating			0
@entity81 invited to key early presidential state @entity92 gov. @entity91 's willingness to play along with a 2016 joke on wednesday 's " @entity94 with @entity95			1
" @entity8 's visits already to @entity97 and @entity1 , and upcoming trips to @entity99 and @entity97 ( again )			1
@entity81 's appearance last month at a @entity99 @entity14 fundraiser and an upcoming visit to @entity97			0
@entity104 gov. @entity103 headlining a @entity1 @entity14 fundraiser last month			2
@entity107 sen. @entity106 headlining a fundraiser this week for the @entity1 @entity14			2
@entity84 's use of his political action committee to finance a television commercial that defended @entity1 sen. @entity112 against critics of her position on gun rights			1
@entity87 's visit to @entity99 in march to campaign for a @entity14 candidate in a special congressional election , and his planned visit to @entity97 this summer			2
@entity86 gov. @entity121 's appearance at a county @entity14 fundraiser in @entity97 last month			0
@entity121 trip fuels 2016 speculation to dismiss all this political activity would be naïve			0
beyond the obvious -- control of the @entity37 and the direction of the country for four or eight years -- these potential candidates are already exerting influence over the national dialogue and the direction of their political party			1
on immigration : @entity84 is the key player at the moment , while @entity81 may have an influential role as the legislation is being debated			0
on the surveillance controversy : @entity8 has become a chief spokesman opposing this collection of information			0
on the state of the @entity14 : @entity103 has admonished fellow republicans to " stop being the stupid party			0
" on where to find solutions : @entity83 and @entity121 emphasizing the need for national republicans to look to the states for answers			0
while @entity1 @entity14 acknowledge that it 's too early for candidates to engage in a full - blown campaign , there are steps potential presidential candidates can take now that are being welcomed , if not embraced			1
" what @entity8 and @entity103 are doing is very smart , " @entity157 , a @entity14 strategist based in @entity158 , said of the fundraising for the state party and air cover provided to @entity112			0
" they are trying to do well for others and by doing so are helping themselves			0
it 's never too early when you come on behalf of others			2
" but when is too early ? it 's fair to say that @entity169 never stopped running for president after he lost the @entity14 nomination in 2008 , and @entity172 was very active early on in building a campaign structure for the 2012 election , only to become the first candidate to drop out of the race in august 2011			1
what a candidate ca n't do is suddenly decide to run for president a year before the primary without having done any spade work and expect strong results			0
" you ca n't do it in 12 months , " said @entity1 @entity14 chair @entity182 , who noted that a campaign needs to begin sooner rather than later			1
and when the candidates arrive , @entity187 said , " the issues that push @entity1 voters are jobs , the economy , and individual freedoms			1
" while social conservatives play an influential role in the @entity97 and @entity99 primaries , @entity1 @entity14 tend to be more focused on economic issues , which could provide a springboard for more a centrist @entity14 eyeing the @entity37 -- someone like @entity91			1
" @entity1 voters focus on the issues that directly affect them , primarily the economy , " said @entity199 , a @entity14 consultant based in @entity200			2
" social issues tend to be second - tier for most @entity1 voters and they are willing to accept a social moderate as long as they have a fiscal conservative badge			1
" @entity91 passes on conservative gathering for @entity210 conference if there is a contested primary - within - a - primary among social conservative candidates who spend their time , money and effort attacking one another in @entity97 and @entity99 , that could further add to the already outsized influence @entity1 has on the process of choosing the @entity14 nominee			1
the winner of the @entity1 primary might not suffer the same political wounds as the candidates who battled for support in the @entity97 caucuses and prepared for , perhaps , a last stand in @entity99			1
still , as early @entity14 maneuvering is on full public display , @entity229 are largely in a holding pattern waiting to see if the 800 - pound donkey in the room makes a move : former secretary of state @entity236			0
it 's @entity210 's for the having -- at least that 's the conventional wisdom at this point -- if she wants the @entity229 presidential nomination			2
should @entity210 decide not to run , then vice president @entity241 rolling out the red carpet for @entity97 and @entity1 @entity229 during the inauguration and @entity245 gov. @entity244 inviting @entity1 @entity229 down for a @entity247 party at the governor 's residence will surely be remembered by those who hold an incredible amount of influence in choosing presidents .			1

while it 's too early to mount a campaign , there are steps potential candidates are taking
