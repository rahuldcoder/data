-- it 's been a tough last few days for @entity3 hockey at the @entity4			1
first the @entity3 women lost in heartbreaking fashion to arch - rival @entity8 , unable to protect a lead late in the third period of the final			1
then the men lost to the @entity8 in the semifinals friday , ending hopes of a first men 's hockey gold since the famous @entity17 in @entity18 34 years ago			1
and now the men will be going home with no medal at all after being crushed by @entity22 's @entity21 5 - 0 in the bronze medal game saturday			1
surely no one saw this coming after the @entity3 stunned @entity26 in the group stage and scored 20 goals in its first four games			2
" the way we played the last two games we did n't deserve ( a medal ) , " @entity3 captain @entity30 told @entity31			1
coming into the final round i thought we were playing well			0
i 'm kind of embarrassed where we 're at now			0
" the 43 - year - old @entity22 scored two goals in what was expected to be his farewell match at the @entity42 and @entity43 made 27 saves for the shutout as @entity21 collected yet another hockey medal at an @entity47			1
@entity22 opened @entity21 's account early in the second period and with the @entity3 still trying to recover , @entity48 made it 2 - 0 11 seconds later			1
the @entity3 did n't recover -- and some would say it did n't recover from the defeat to @entity8			1
summing up the evening for the @entity3 was @entity52 missing penalty shots in the first two periods			2
" we did n't show up , " @entity3 forward @entity55 told @entity31			2
" we let our country down , that 's it			0
" but while there was despair for the @entity3 , @entity22 was overjoyed and mobbed by his teammates			2
" maybe this was his last game for the national team and as a captain , " @entity21 coach @entity61 told reporters			2
" it was an excellent game to finish			0
" @entity8 goes for a second straight gold in men 's hockey when it faces @entity72 on sunday			1
@entity73 oldest winner there was also disappointment for the @entity3 in arguably saturday 's biggest event , the men 's slalom , on the penultimate day of the @entity47 as @entity80 could n't complete the second run			1
but at least @entity80 already had a gold from the giant slalom			0
top spot went to @entity85 's @entity73 , a feel - good story since the 34 - year - old became the oldest man ever to claim alpine skiing gold			1
he edged his countryman and the heavy favorite , @entity92			0
" most impressive day in my career , " @entity73 told reporters			2
" it started 14 years ago , and i 'm totally happy that i made it to the finish			0
" @entity92 leads the circuit in both the slalom and overall standings and almost made up a 1.28 - second first - run deficit , finishing 0.28 seconds behind @entity102 @entity80 was left frustrated with the difficulty of the course and he would n't have been the only one , since half of the top - 10 finishers from the first run did n't complete the second			0
the casualties allowed @entity112 's @entity111 to nab the bronze			1
at 19 , he became the youngest man to win a medal in alpine skiing			1
" not all the best guys had the chance to make it down , unfortunately , but it is what it is , " @entity80 told the @entity3 ski team 's website			2
" i would have liked to have done better , and i put myself in a position to have a chance			0
" this course was difficult and it was a battle of attrition			0
" @entity125 gave @entity85 a second gold on snow saturday , bettering the field in snowboard 's parallel slalom			1
@entity112 legend if this was @entity133 's last @entity47 , she went out on a high			1
@entity133 led a @entity112 sweep in @entity137 skiing 's 30 - kilometer race to pick up her third gold of the @entity42 and 10th @entity47 medal overall -- no woman has gotten more at the @entity141			1
the 33 - year - old hinted that she would n't be competing at the 2018 games in @entity144			0
" four years is a long time , and i 'm not getting younger , " @entity133 told reporters			2
" i 'm also thinking about having a family			0
i do n't want to do this at 90 percent			0
" @entity148 makes history , too @entity150 , born in the @entity3 before switching nationalities to @entity26 when he married a @entity26 snowboarder , became the first athlete to win two snowboarding gold medals at the same @entity47 when he triumphed in the men 's parallel slalom ahead of @entity158 's @entity157			1
@entity148 is snowboarding for @entity26 because he said funding was an issue in the @entity3 " i would not have snowboarded for the @entity3 , " @entity150 told the @entity161			2
" i was done snowboarding			0
i would have moved on			0
i would have gone to college and i would have had a great life			0
" i had another option -- the only option to snowboard was to go to @entity26 and snowboard			0
" with only three medals up for grabs sunday , @entity148 boosted @entity26 's chances of topping both the medal and gold - medal standings			1
@entity26 's biathlon team also chipped in , capturing gold in the 4 x 7.5km relay despite missing eight targets			0
@entity26 has 29 medals , leading the @entity3 by two , and is tied with @entity112 for 11 golds			1
elsewhere , was there any doubt about who would claim the team pursuit gold medals in speed skating ? probably not			0
the @entity183 have cleaned up in @entity184 and the men and women stood tallest on saturday , a fitting conclusion given the nation 's superiority on the -- speed skating -- ice .			0

the @entity3 loses to @entity21 5 - 0 in hockey 's bronze medal game
the result comes a day after a *demoralizing* loss to @entity8 in the semis
@entity85 's @entity73 becomes the oldest man to win gold in alpine skiing
@entity112 's @entity133 makes history by collecting 10th @entity47 medal
