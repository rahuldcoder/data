-- scientists descended into a deep cave , hoping to find @entity5 mammals ' remains			1
what they found stunned them : the remains of hundreds of big prehistoric mammals			1
the treasure trove was discovered in the @entity10 at the base of @entity12 in north - central @entity13			1
" we did n't know what to expect			0
we had n't been there in 30 years and we did n't know what the cave would be like , " @entity16 , a professor at @entity17 , told @entity0			2
she was among the scientists who rappelled down the 85 - foot cave to excavate			2
researchers believe these ancient animals may have fallen into what was then a sinkhole - like pit			0
@entity10 , part of land run by the on @entity29 , was discovered by an international team of paleontologists back in the 1970s			1
in past excavations , scientists have discovered the fossils of mammoths , short - faced bears , collared lemmings , and camels buried underneath layers of sediment			1
the cave is cool and damp -- prefect for preserving prehistoric remains , @entity16 says			1
" it 's like a refrigerator in there , " she said			0
" some of the bones we 're finding there have collagen in them			0
that is where you could get the ancient dna			0
" the scientists saw bones falling out of a part of the cave , and decided to start digging there			0
" that was the fossil layer , " she said			0
" there is so much to dig. we have two more years for funding that we can be out there , so we are going to try to dig up as much as we can			0
" this year 's excavation was funded by @entity69			0
professor @entity70 of @entity72 's @entity71 was also part of the excavation that began on july 29			1
the @entity29 in @entity13 tweeted a video of the professor discussing the fossil finds at @entity10 on thursday , which was uploaded to @entity79			2
" this is one of the richest sites for megafauna mammal bones in the lower 48 states and southern @entity86 , " he said in the video			0
@entity88 mammals are considered to be large or giant animals , typically larger than a human			0
some of the remains are believed to be of the @entity92 and the @entity94 cheetah , @entity70 explained in the video			1
some of the species found are estimated to have gone extinct more than 20,000 years ago , according to the @entity96			1
" i 've had this list of really puzzling evolutionary mysteries , things like the @entity102 wolf or the @entity94 cheetah , which we are finding bones of here , and the @entity94 lion , " @entity97 said			2
scientists are using latex gloves and breathing masks while surfacing the prehistoric remains as a way to ensure that excavators ' dna do not get onto the animal bones			1
characteristics such as weight , smoothness of the surface and coloring can help scientists determine whether these prehistoric bones have genetic matter that they can test			2
the best preserved remains will be packed in cooler containers and transported back to universities in the @entity94 and also the @entity126 of @entity112 and the @entity71 for testing			1
8 places for fantastic fossil finds as heavy as 14 elephants , as long as 2 tractor trailers : meet mr. @entity132 scientists discover what may be the biggest bird ever to fly			0

hundreds of prehistoric animal remains were discovered in @entity13
scientists *suspect* some remains date back 20,000 years
remains will be transported to universities in the @entity94 and @entity72
