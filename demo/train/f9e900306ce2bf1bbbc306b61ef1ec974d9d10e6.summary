-- when sheriff 's deputies arrested @entity3 in 2008 over the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , few would have anticipated it would end like this : just days after her trial , jailers arranging a clandestine release launching the @entity11 woman back into a world where her story could make her rich or put her life in danger			1
but that 's precisely the scenario that will play out sometime sunday when @entity19 completes serving her time on four misdemeanor counts of misleading police			1
@entity19 , 25 , was acquitted july 5 of murder and child neglect charges in the death of her daughter , @entity3 , whose skeletal remains were found in 2008 in a wooded field			1
she was convicted on four counts of misleading police and was sentenced to four years in prison			0
after serving nearly three years in prison while awaiting trial , she was ordered released this weekend			2
the abrupt end to a criminal case that at times transfixed the nation resulted in anger and revulsion as well as donations of cash to her jailhouse account			0
it 's also led to speculation that the polarizing subject of the " @entity51 " @entity47 page -- and the source of ire for its more than 40,000 fans -- might change her name and appearance and move someplace far away			1
" if her attorneys are doing the right thing and are doing their jobs , they 're going to have to explain to her that there is real hatred out there for her , that there have been death threats , that she can not just walk amongst the population , " @entity57 legal contributor @entity55 said			2
" that is not just going to happen			0
" whatever she ends up doing , first she has to get out of jail			0
few details have been publicly released about how @entity19 will be let out of the @entity74 , where she has been held since her arrest in october 2008			1
court officials have released limited information to reporters , mostly plans to bring three journalists inside a secure area of the jail sometime late friday or early saturday and cut them off from outside access while they wait for @entity19 's release			1
when exactly @entity19 will be freed has n't been made public			1
that 's in part likely due to the intense emotions @entity19 's release has generated			1
" i know it 's bad @entity90 forgive me but i hope someone wipes that smirk off her face			0
with a mack truck , " one poster on the " i hate @entity3 " @entity47 page wrote			1
another poster , referencing rumored lucrative interview , book and movie deals , said the only thing she 'd pay to see or read would be about " @entity3 's dead body			1
" the page features @entity19 's mug shot with a bullseye target on her forehead under the headline " hey , @entity111 , i 'd watch out if i were you , just sayin '			1
" an @entity113 woman said she has already faced the kind of ire @entity19 may face when she 's no longer behind the protective walls of the @entity74			1
@entity117 told @entity0 affiliate @entity118 that a woman who mistook her for @entity19 on july 8 rammed her car twice , flipping it over			1
" she said that i was trying to hurt babies , i was killing babies and she was going to stop it before it happened again , " @entity117 told the station			0
as it happens , @entity117 has a daughter named @entity3 too , but that 's the end of the similarities			1
she says she really does n't even look that much like @entity19 and worries for women who do			1
sheriff @entity133 said tuesday that investigators are assessing threats to @entity19 's safety			2
while he said that the department was not aware of any credible threats to her life , it 's a concern that was clearly on his mind			0
" nobody has a right to take the law in their own hands , " he said			0
" @entity3 had her day in court and the jury made a decision			2
i would hope people would step back and would not go out and commit another crime			0
" it 's also a concern for her attorneys			0
" @entity158 and other members of the team are concerned for her safety , very much so , " one of her attorneys , @entity156 , told @entity57			0
what @entity19 will do after her release is unclear			2
" well if i knew at this point i 'm sure you can appreciate that i would n't ' tell you , " @entity164 said			0
" i do n't believe that that has been resolved			0
my hope for her would be that she would be left alone and her privacy would be respected			0
" @entity55 said on @entity0 that she 's heard reports that @entity19 will go into hiding , live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery			2
" but i think we are going to hear her story because people have offered her a million dollars already for her story , " she said			0
@entity19 also still has legal issues to deal with			2
her criminal team is appealing her convictions for misleading police , and she is being sued in two separate actions in civil court			0
one is filed by a woman with the same name @entity19 gave to investigators as the name of her daughter 's nanny			1
the other involves a search group that wants @entity19 to repay expenses they incurred looking for @entity3			1
@entity19 may be offered money for book and movie deals , but one offer wo n't be on the table			2
@entity203 founder @entity202 told @entity0 's @entity204 that the magazine wo n't be offering @entity19 a pictorial			2
" i would n't reward someone like that for what has happened , " @entity202 said			0
attorney @entity210 , who once said he thought of @entity19 as a granddaughter , said he does n't know what life holds in store for his client , but has hopes			1
" she is only 25 year old			0
a decade from now , hopefully , she 'll have some stability in her life and maybe a husband , and they can be somewhere in @entity222 and start over , " he said .			0
