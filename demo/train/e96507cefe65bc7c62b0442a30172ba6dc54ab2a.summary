alcohol has been involved in most of the deaths blamed on the extreme cold in @entity7 , the country worst affected by the icy temperatures gripping @entity2 , a government minister said wednesday			1
nine out of 10 of the deaths reported have been alcohol - related , emergency situations minister @entity8 said			1
at least 135 deaths have been reported in @entity7 in the past two weeks , but he suggested the actual number that can be blamed on the winter weather is somewhat lower , at 112			1
about 3,000 people have been hospitalized because of the cold since january 27 , officials said			2
authorities in @entity7 have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold - related conditions , and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country , they said			1
the tents are heated , and people with nowhere else to go can get hot food and drinks			0
@entity7 's capital , @entity29 , has more than 14,000 homeless people , authorities said			1
they are among the most vulnerable to winter 's bitter chill			1
dr. @entity33 , doctor - in - chief at an emergency help station in @entity29 , told @entity35 many of those suffering frostbite , hypothermia and in some cases death were alcoholics -- but that others had been drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm			1
outdoor workers , such as those at market stalls , were also suffering frostbite in the extreme conditions , he said , as were some children whose parents had let them spend too long outside			0
@entity50 , a spokesman for the @entity51 in @entity2 , said : " it is an unfortunate fact that a lot of homeless people are alcoholic or dependent on other substances -- it may be why they are homeless in the first place			1
" alcohol creates the illusion of being warm , so it 's not surprising that people are drinking and not surprising that they pass out , " he said , adding that this is when hypothermia can occur			1
" our approach would be to try to get to these people before they have too much to drink , if we can find them and get them to safety			2
obviously , a full belly or hot drinks is far , far better for you than vodka			0
" @entity51 volunteers have been working with authorities to help distribute warm clothing , boots , hot food and drinks in @entity7 and elsewhere , @entity50 said , speaking to @entity35 from @entity76			1
but , he added , the people who are most in need of help are often hard to locate			0
" these people are outside the normal safety nets , difficult to find , and do n't realize the great danger they are in			0
" dr. @entity83 , director of the @entity84 in the @entity85 at the @entity86 , said consuming alcohol is dangerous in cold weather for two main reasons			1
one is that alcohol causes the dilation of blood vessels in the skin , which means they are wider and more blood passes through			1
this makes the person feel hot , which is not an issue if the person is warmly dressed and indoors , @entity83 said			0
but " if he or she is not wearing enough warm clothes they will lose heat rapidly , and that can contribute to hypothermia			1
" secondly , he said , a person who is inebriated may not have the ability to judge what 's happening or respond appropriately			2
he or she may slip and fall in the icy conditions and risk becoming unconscious , or fall asleep as alcohol depresses the central nervous system , he said			0
@entity83 advises those who are inebriated to stay inside for safety , where possible , or if they must be outside to dress in several warm layers to stop heat escaping and try to ward off hypothermia			2
@entity29 marked its 24th consecutive day of below - freezing temperatures wednesday , with a low of minus 18 @entity123 ) , @entity35 meteorologist @entity120 said			1
it could normally expect a high of minus 2 degrees @entity123 at this time of year			0
and there is little respite in prospect for those suffering in the unusual cold			0
another surge of frigid air is pushing westward out of @entity133 into the rest of @entity2 for the end of the week , with @entity136 and @entity2 catching the brunt of the coldest air , @entity120 said			2
temperatures in some of the hardest hit countries , such as @entity7 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , will once again drop below average by as much as 15 to 20 degrees @entity123 ( 25 to 35 degrees @entity145 )			1
@entity146 , in @entity147 , which would normally expect a high of 2 degrees @entity123 ( 36 degrees @entity145 ) , has now spent 15 days below freezing , while @entity149 in @entity150 has spent 14 days in subzero temperatures , well below the average for this time of year of 5 degrees @entity123 ( 41 degrees @entity145			2
) temperatures are likely to remain below average well into next week , at the least , with no significant warming likely until late february , @entity120 said			2
parts of the @entity156 , one of the most important rivers in @entity2 for commerce , have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years , showing not only the intensity of this cold snap , but also its longevity			1
the sustained cold spell is also putting a strain on power providers across the region and has raised questions over @entity2 's reliance on @entity133 for gas , as supplies sent via @entity7 have dipped below the expected levels			1
@entity7 energy minister @entity173 said electricity consumption in the country is historically high			1
but in an interview with @entity35 , he rejected suggestions that @entity7 has been siphoning off gas as it transits from @entity133 to @entity2			1
@entity173 said the main reason for the 30 % drop in gas reaching @entity2 was the extremely cold weather in @entity133 , which meant a smaller than usual amount of gas entered @entity7			1
instead of @entity7 receiving the expected 500 million cubic meters per day , only 400 million cubic meters came to its western border , he said			2
@entity186 , @entity133 's gas monopoly , has denied sending lower volumes of gas to @entity2			1
but @entity173 said he believes the real answer is that given by the deputy chairman of @entity186 , whom he quoted as saying the company was not ready to send additional supplies to @entity2 during the cold spell			1

@entity260 will see more heavy snow , while the northeast is predicted to shiver under temperatures much lower than its winter averages , meteorologists said			1
the @entity267 capital , @entity268 , has spent nearly two weeks below freezing , whereas it would normally average 4 degrees @entity123 ( 39 degrees fahrenheit )			0
in @entity268 , @entity35 ireporter @entity270 said it is too cold to stay outside for longer than 10 minutes			2
water at a dam in the city , the @entity276 , has frozen solid , she said			0
