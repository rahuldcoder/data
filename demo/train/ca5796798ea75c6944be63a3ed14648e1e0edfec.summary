-- the @entity3 and @entity4 will begin using body scanners on airline passengers following the attempted terrorist attack on a @entity9 - bound flight on christmas day , authorities in both nations said wednesday			1
the millimeter - wave body scanners will be in place at @entity13 's @entity13 in about three weeks and will be used on all passengers traveling to the @entity9 , @entity3 interior minister @entity10 told a news conference at the @entity16			1
" we 've escaped a very serious attack with serious consequences , but unfortunately in this world there are individuals who do not shy away from attacks on innocent people , " she said			2
@entity4 did not say when it would begin the new scans			1
" in combating the new threat of terrorism as unfolded recently , @entity4 will be upgrading its security screening system to @entity32 , " the country 's airport authority said in a statement			1
it gave no further details			2

@entity4 suspect @entity38 , 23 , is accused of trying to blow up a @entity40 plane going from @entity13 to @entity41 , @entity42 , with explosives that had been concealed in his underwear			1
he is charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft			0
the militant group @entity47 has claimed responsibility for the december 25 plot			0
@entity3 authorities have already said they were confident in the security measures that were carried out when @entity38 transferred to the @entity41 flight from an earlier flight from @entity4			1
a source in @entity55 , @entity4 , with connections to the aviation industry told @entity0 that @entity58 arrived in @entity4 from @entity59 , @entity60 , on december 24			2
he flew in on a @entity62 flight , arriving in @entity55 about 7:30 p.m. local time ( 1:30 p.m. et ) , about an hour before he checked in for a @entity65 flight to @entity13			2
he checked one bag , the source said			0
@entity68 said that security measures in place in @entity13 were metal detectors and x-ray machines , and admitted they could not have picked up the explosive material that @entity58 was allegedly carrying			1
" the introduction of these body scanners would certainly have helped in detecting that he was carrying something on his body , " she said			1
" we know that metal detection does not help to detect non-metal explosives , and these millimeter - wave scanners can do this , which would mean that this would be an improvement			2
" one passenger on same plane as @entity38 told @entity0 's " @entity91 " that the security checks at @entity13 were not as stringent as those she is used to in the @entity9			1
" we walked through and did not have to take our shoes off , " said @entity93 native @entity92			0
" also , my mother had a water bottle in her bag that she 'd completely forgotten about			0
and it went right through and we did n't realize it until we were on the plane			0
" @entity68 acknowledged that the systems currently in place are " not watertight , " which is why the body scanners are being introduced			1
as to privacy concerns -- namely that the scanners could pick up private features of a person 's body -- ter @entity68 said the scan results would first go through a computer , which would then flag any suspicious items to a human			1
the scanners will be permanent at @entity13 , and any passengers bound for the @entity9 who do not go through them will be body - searched , ter @entity68 said			1
@entity115 , the @entity3 national coordinator for counterterrorism , said part of the investigation is looking at whether the explosives were brought into @entity13 by someone else for @entity38 to pick up later			1
@entity3 authorities are also looking into whom he was in touch with while at @entity13 awaiting his connecting flight			1
they are combing surveillance camera footage from the connections hall , @entity115 said			0
asked about reports that @entity38 paid for his ticket in cash and was flying only with hand luggage , @entity115 said neither would have necessarily raised any alarms			0
" there are several travelers who do this , " he said			0
@entity38 's name had come to the attention of @entity9 authorities before the attack , sources have told @entity0 in recent days			0
his father talked twice about his son 's extremist views with at least one @entity145 representative at the @entity146 in @entity4 and a report was prepared , but the report was not circulated outside the agency , a reliable source told @entity0 's @entity150 on tuesday			2
had that critical information been shared , the man might have been denied passage on the flight , the source said			0
a @entity9 intelligence official said @entity38 's name , passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated			0
but the official added , " i 'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence -- somehow withheld -- that would have put @entity38 on the no - fly list			0
" @entity145 spokesman @entity165 defended the agency 's actions regarding @entity38 , but also said the agency is reviewing data to ascertain whether more could have been done			0
@entity171 spokesman @entity170 said department staff did what they were supposed to by sending a cable to the @entity176 in @entity177 about the matter			0
@entity170 said any decision to revoke the suspect 's visa would have been an interagency decision			0
@entity68 said @entity3 authorities did not know that @entity38 had raised any security flags , and she called for a global watch list for all suspect travelers in the future .			1
