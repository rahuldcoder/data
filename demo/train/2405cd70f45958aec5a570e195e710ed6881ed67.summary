@entity0 -- pilot error was to blame in the april 2006 crash of an unmanned aircraft , despite the fact no pilot was on board , the @entity2 said in its accident report issued tuesday -- the @entity2 's first - ever investigation into an incident involving a drone			1
a drone similar to this one crashed near @entity15 , @entity16 , on april 25 , 2006			0
the agency also issued 22 safety recommendations for unmanned aircraft			1
it " is an indication of the scope of the safety issues these unmanned aircraft are bringing into the @entity26 , " @entity2 chairman @entity20 said in a statement			1
the unmanned aerial vehicles have been touted as a possible solution to several issues facing the @entity30 , from drug trafficking to illegal border crossings			0
but , as the @entity2 report shows , integrating them into the nation 's airspace raises questions regarding their safety status -- and whether they should be held to a different standard than manned aircraft			2
on april 25 , 2006 , a turboprop - powered @entity43 , operated on a surveillance mission by @entity42 , crashed in a sparsely - populated area near @entity15 , @entity16			0
there were no injuries , but the aircraft , which has a 66 - foot wingspan , was " substantially damaged , " the @entity2 said			2
the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the pilot -- who was operating the aircraft remotely -- to follow checklist procedures when switching operational control from a console that had locked up , the agency said			1
that resulted in the fuel valve 's being inadvertently shut off and a total loss of engine power to the aircraft			0
another cause , the @entity2 said , was the lack of a flight instructor in the ground control station			0
but in a meeting tuesday , the board highlighted areas of interest including the design and certification of unmanned aircraft ; pilot qualification and training ; and audio records of all @entity77 operations - related communications , among others			1
the @entity79 does n't require a pilot 's certificate to operate a drone			0
" this investigation has raised questions about the different standards for manned and unmanned aircraft and the safety implications of this discrepancy , " @entity20 said in the statement			1
" why , for example , were numerous unresolved lock - ups of the pilot 's control console even possible while such conditions would never be tolerated in the cockpit of a manned aircraft ? " the pilot , the @entity2 noted , was not proficient in emergency procedures			1
" the pilot is still the pilot , whether he is at a remote console or on the flight deck , " @entity20 said			1
" we need to make sure that the system by which pilots are trained and readied for flight is rigorous and thorough			0
with the potential for thousands of these unmanned aircraft in use years from now , the standards for pilot training need to be set high to ensure that those on the ground and other users of the airspace are not put in jeopardy			2
" also , there is no equivalent of a cockpit voice recorder at a pilot console , the board said , and the pilot 's communication with air traffic controllers and others was not recorded			2
the @entity2 has recommended the @entity79 require all conversations , including telephone conversations , between pilots of unmanned aircraft and others be recorded and retained			1
other recommendations , sent to the @entity79 and @entity42 , include : requiring all unmanned aircraft operations to report incidents of equipment malfunctions that affect safety to the @entity79 , and require analysis of the data			1
requiring pilots be trained on the expected performance and flight path of an unmanned aircraft any time communication with the aircraft is lost			2
identifying and correcting the causes of the lockups in the pilot 's control console			0
requiring that a backup pilot or another person who can provide an equivalent level of safety as a backup pilot be readily available during the operation of a @entity77 system			0
board members also voted to convene a two - to three - day public forum on the safety of @entity77 operations and investigative procedures			0

@entity161 issues 22 safety recommendations for unmanned aircraft
@entity2 : the pilot is still the pilot , whether he is at a remote console or on board
agency : probable cause of 2006 drone crash was pilot error
