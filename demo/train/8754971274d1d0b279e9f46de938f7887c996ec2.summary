-- @entity1 has nabbed @entity3 's spinning chairs ! after " @entity8 " swiped some of " @entity6 's " ratings thunder this season , @entity1 is now returning the favor , launching a new show called ... " @entity11			1
" in an announcement that seems like a brilliant @entity14 ( but , we 're assured , is not ) , @entity1 's new summer series will feature -- like " @entity8 " -- contestants in blind auditions for a quartet of celebrity judges who are seated in spinning chairs			1
the big difference : instead of a music competition , this is a dating show			1
so , yes , famous faces will audition their potential love interests , making a contestant 's hidden physical appearance potentially quite relevant to the celebrity in the power seat			2
@entity1 is not ready to announce the participating celebrities , but we can reveal the show 's host will be @entity32 , pulling double duty while hosting " @entity36 " this summer			1
" @entity11 " is from longtime @entity1 alternative series president @entity37 and producers @entity39 , who presumably did n't get this idea while watching " @entity43			1
" " i think there 's a big hole in the dating show world , " says @entity37 , who is also launching the @entity45 dating show import " @entity46 " this summer			1
" there has n't been a new hit since ' the bachelor , ' and there has n't been an in - studio one that 's worked since ' @entity56 ' 30 years ago			2
i was thinking about how to do a blind - date show without using a wall or blindfolds , and the spinning chairs seemed like a great way to do it			1
" ' @entity62 ' : a salute of course , " @entity11 " has more in common with " @entity8 " than just chairs -- like that title , for instance ? " ' @entity11 ' seems like an obvious title because you have to make a choice , " @entity37 says , then playfully adds : " i 'm just now realizing it rhymes ! " @entity1 plans to air six one - hour episodes this summer , debuting the show on thursday , june 7 at 9 p.m. five of the episodes will have male celebrities with female contestants ; one will have female celebrities and male contestants			1
all the singles will be physically attractive ( i know , you expected @entity1 to stock the pond with some wicked surprises , right ? )			2
' celeb apprentice ' peek : @entity84 in the first round , celebrities will listen to " sexy singles " describe themselves			0
if the celebrity bachelor likes what he hears , instead of a big red button the star will pull his " love handle , " spinning his chair around to bring him face - to - face with his potential mate			2
if more than one celebrity pulls their handle , they battle for her affection until the contestant decides who they prefer to date			0
once each bachelor has his three prospective dates , the teams enter the " @entity111 " round , where each woman has seconds to convince the man to select her for the final round			0
then @entity32 will pose a challenge question to the final two contestants			0
the winners get to go on one date with their celebrity			0
" many people say its what 's inside that counts , " @entity37 says , " now we 'll see			0
