-- i have a bright , funny 12 - year - old son			1
he plays a mean game of basketball , loves strawberry banana smoothies and spends way too much time texting on his @entity6			0
and , if you believe a new study just released , there 's a 50 - 50 chance he 'll end up in handcuffs sometime before he turns 23			1
a report from the @entity13 and the @entity14 released this month in the journal @entity16 argued that by the time they reach age 23 , nearly one in two black males ( 49 % ) will have been arrested			1
and the study does n't even count arrests in minor traffic violations			2
and for white males , there is almost a 40 % chance they will have been arrested by 23 , according to the report			1
for @entity28 males , its 44 %			1
by age 23 , arrest rates were 20 % for white females , 18 % for @entity34 and 16 % black females			1
looking deeper into the study , it showed that for younger boys -- those of any race who have yet to turn 18 -- there is about a one in four chance they 'll get arrested			1
that is stunning , no matter what race you are			0
there are critics of the study who say that methodology is flawed , that " it is more of an experiment about handling missing waves of data from a longitudinal sample than a meaningful study about race , gender and crime , " @entity47 , an author and @entity49 researcher at @entity50 , said in an article on @entity66			1
but even if the number is off by half , it 's still alarming			0
can you imagine the impact of your young son -- or grandson , or nephew , or cousin or brother -- having to look down the barrel of a police officer 's gun , or having his wrists forcibly twisted behind his back and handcuffed in public ? and , in many cases , all before he is old enough to vote			2
can you imagine how that young boy will grow up to be a man ? can you imagine his feelings toward the police -- many of whom are trying as hard as they can to keep the streets safe -- who put those handcuffs on him ? will he trust them ? will he respect them ? or will he fear them ? now , can you imagine the difficulties when that same young man goes to get a job ? many employers ask you at the end of that job application form whether you have ever been arrested			2
these kids will forever have to check the @entity104 box , hoping they get the chance to explain away the circumstances later			2
but we know most will never make it to the first interview			0
the study 's author put it in context			2
" a problem is that many males -- especially black males -- are navigating the transition from youth to adulthood with the baggage and difficulties from contact with the criminal justice system , " said @entity113 , a criminology professor at the @entity13 and lead author of the report			1
ours is a society that lives in fear			0
a society that has created a multibillion - dollar industry based on locking people up			0
we want our cops to protect us , to confront first , arrest next , then resolve later			2
sure , crime is a real problem in @entity133 , although the crime rate has been steadily declining for more than the past decade , according to the @entity135			0
so has the rate of young black men entering accredited four - year colleges , compared to black females and others			0
but the unemployment rate among those same young men -- many of whom had to check that @entity104 box on the application -- is still more than twice that of the population at large , according to the @entity149			0
as a father , i will do everything i can to make sure my son is not one of the 50 % who get arrested , but instead among the 50 % who do n't			1
i am determined that my son will do great in school , stay away from the wrong element in the streets and , by 23 , will have hopefully graduated from college , gone on to graduate school or started his first job in the real world ( and moved out of the house , for sure ! ) but it just angers me that , in 2014 , i now have to teach him , along with how to tie a tie , how to write a proper resume and how to open the door for a lady , how he must behave when confronted by the police			1
keep your hands at 10 and 2			0
do n't make any fast moves			0
and do what they ask of you			0
and maybe , just maybe , you wo n't end up on your knees , hands behind your back , feeling the cold of the steel around your wrists			0
maybe ... the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187			1

recent report says black males have a 50 % chance of being arrested by age 23
white males have a 40 % risk of arrest by same age
critics of the study say methodology is flawed
@entity187 : what do i tell my son about how to avoid being arrested ?
