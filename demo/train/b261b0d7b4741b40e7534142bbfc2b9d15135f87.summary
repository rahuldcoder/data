@entity0 is relaxing its rules for teenagers			1
the 13 - to 17 - year - old set now has the option to share photos , updates and comments with the general public on @entity0			1
that means strangers , and companies collecting data for advertisers and marketing companies , will be able to see select posts			0
teenagers will also be able to turn on the @entity18 feature for their profiles , which would allow anyone they 're not friends with to see their public posts in the main news feed			0
the changes will take effect immediately , the company announced in a blog post			2
the new setting might help @entity0 compete against other social networks that skew younger , and having public data on teens will also help the company appeal to advertisers			1
the social network is trying to balance the less strict settings with two other privacy protections			0
when new underage users sign up for a @entity0 account , their posts will be shown to a more limited audience by default -- only to friends instead of friends of friends			1
if a teen decides to change the setting to @entity52 , she or he will see a pair of pop - up warnings explaining what " public " means			1
one warns they could end up " getting friend requests and messages from people they do n't know personally			0
" default settings for existing teens with profiles wo n't change or affect past posts			2
privacy ? forget it , we 're all celebrities online now @entity0 has been around for more than nine years and stopped being a hip place for kids long ago when it was invaded by parents , grandparents and advertisers			1
it has 1.2 billion users			0
even as it expands to all ages , the company has to work to hang on to the coveted teen demographic			0
in a recent @entity79 study , teens reported " waning enthusiasm " for the social network , citing the presence of adults and drama			2
the site has become too important to typical teen life to abandon , so 94 % of teens on social media have a @entity0 account , and the average teen user has 300 friends			1
other social networks such as @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 do n't prevent teens from posting publicly			1
however , if someone under 18 wanted to bypass the setting on @entity0 before today , they could easily lie about their age when signing up for an account			2
children under 13 are not officially allowed to sign up for a @entity0 account , though they can skirt the rules in the same way			0
when someone underage does sign up for an account , @entity0 assumes they have the permission of at least one guardian but does not verify it in any way			0
young people and social media : docs examine pitfalls			0
