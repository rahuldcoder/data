-- when @entity2 crashed into the mountains near @entity4 on june 4 , 1969 , it claimed the lives of 79 people including a national hero and one of the greatest players to wield a tennis racket			1
he had carried the hopes of his country for a decade until his life was tragically cut short , just days after leading @entity15 to an epic victory over all - conquering @entity17 in a @entity19 tie , the crowning achievement of a remarkable career			2
he was a grand slam winner , a former world number one and one of the most innovative doubles players in the sport 's history			1
@entity27 was , quite possibly , the greatest tennis player you never knew , a compelling and inspirational figure , but more than 40 years since his death he has been largely forgotten			1
perhaps this is because @entity32 was at his peak during the 1960s , before the blanket television coverage of grand slams and major competitions such as the @entity19			2
clips of him in action are mostly in grainy black and white , but even to the non-expert eye his style of play and breathtaking speed on the court stood out			0
his modern namesake @entity46 batters opponents into submission with grueling baseline rallies , but @entity50 used his lightning - fast reactions to shorten points , rushing to the net behind his service to pull off unlikely volleyed winners			0
" he was the quickest of his era , " recalled legendary tennis broadcaster @entity56 , who commentated on many of the @entity15 star 's biggest matches , including his 1963 @entity61 final win over @entity62 on the grass of @entity64			1
@entity32 's nephew @entity67 said his uncle had developed his quickness about court from his early days as a junior table tennis player , when forced to run around the table to reach the drop shots of canny older opponents			1
@entity67 also recalled a chance conversation with karate legend @entity76 , who he met while studying in the @entity77			0
@entity76 was telling a story about the only two men he knew who could catch a fly with two fingers			0
one was the martial arts and film legend @entity84 , the other was @entity86 's uncle @entity85			0
" i was amazed , " @entity67 told @entity0			0
" but in a way not surprised , he could intercept an opponent 's drop shot before it bounced ! " @entity32 , who came from a middle - class @entity15 family , studied at @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , going there as a raw freshman and developing his game under the tutelage of coach @entity97			1
" everything he did on court was bad fundamentally , in part because he was such a natural and could get away with it , " @entity97 wrote in a book about his experiences at @entity92			0
" we had to tear his game apart , but he could move like a @entity105 ! " @entity50 's first notable success came at @entity107 in 1960 when he won the doubles with his @entity92 roommate @entity109 , the first unseeded pair to achieve the feat. it was the catalyst for an outstanding doubles career , which saw him claim further grand slam titles at the @entity61 in 1962 and @entity107 in 1964 with his compatriot and @entity19 partner @entity116			1
their doubles combination helped @entity15 to the @entity19 final in 1962 , but they were beaten by one of the greatest @entity17 line - ups of all - time , spearheaded by @entity123			1
@entity56 believes that had @entity50 maintained his college partnership with @entity109 , his success might have been even greater in grand slams , but it was with @entity116 that the pair experimented with a new formation that is commonly used today			0
when serving , the other player would straddle the center line , keeping hunched down low to avoid being hit , before springing up to intercept their opponent 's return			2
it 's called the " i - formation " but @entity56 said @entity32 and @entity116 were the first to use it			2
such unconventional tactics were @entity50 's hallmark and played a major part in his only grand slam singles success in 1963			1
@entity62 was renowned for his big serve - and - volley game			0
@entity50 confounded him by standing way back behind the baseline and then floating back lobbed returns			0
an easy 7 - 5 6 - 4 6 - 2 victory followed and a place is tennis history as the first and only grand slam champion from @entity15			1
it earned @entity50 the @entity153 's world no. 1 ranking at the end of 1963 , the same year he graduated from @entity92 with a degree in business administration			1
in the @entity158 era , a professional circuit ran in opposition to the regular tennis calendar , with players like @entity123 joining the paid ranks after accumulating grand slam titles			1
@entity32 , however , spurned the opportunity and took a job with the tobacco giant @entity167 , while still playing full time			2
" he was offered $ 120,000 in 1962 by @entity168 ( who ran the pro tour ) but turned it down , " claimed @entity67			0
" my uncle had houses in @entity173 , in @entity174 and the @entity176 capital of @entity177 , so money was clearly never an issue			0
" keeping his amateur status meant @entity50 could continue to play at @entity107 , where with @entity116 he won his final grand slam doubles crown and became the first and only @entity15 to grace the cover of the official tournament program in 1964			1
@entity32 reached the semifinals of the @entity61 the following year , and when the @entity188 came to @entity15 in 1968 he won the exhibition tournament in both singles and doubles			1
@entity192 did not become an official medal sport until the @entity194 in @entity195 but the @entity50 family still hold dear the gold medals he was awarded			0
approaching the end of his career at the top , @entity32 continued to play @entity19 and on the clay in @entity174 summoned up one last giant effort as 17 - time winners @entity17 visited for a zonal final			2
@entity50 won all three points for @entity15 in a 3 - 2 victory , including a crucial singles win over @entity17 no. 1 @entity208 , again deploying unusual tactics in the fourth set to prevent his opponent from volleying before breaking his service for the final time			1
no - one can know if @entity15 might have progressed further -- the team lost in the next round to @entity216 after @entity50 had lost his life in one of his country 's worse airline disasters			2
since his death , @entity32 has been honored , with a statue erected and a tennis stadium in @entity15 named after him			1
the ultimate accolade came in 1979 when he was inducted into the @entity225 , but in recent years , with @entity15 struggling to make an impression on the courts of the world , his place in the national consciousness has waned			2
" maybe @entity15 is not so good at celebrating our heroes , he has become an obscure figure from the past , " @entity67 said			0
@entity67 tried to follow in his uncle 's footsteps , playing collegiate tennis , while others such as top 10 - ranked @entity238 were also inspired by his achievements			0
@entity241 player @entity240 , the 1966 men 's @entity107 champion , perhaps best sums it up : " the man surpasses his achievements			0

@entity32 is @entity15 's greatest ever tennis player
he was tragically killed in an air crash in 1969 aged just *30*
@entity32 was the first player from @entity250 to be @entity251 no. 1
he won the @entity61 in 1963 and three grand slam doubles titles
