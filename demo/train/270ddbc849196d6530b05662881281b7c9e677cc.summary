@entity0 -- @entity3 's legislature meets this week to seal a power transfer to new leaders , but do n't hold your breath for signs that the new team will ease up on the tough @entity3 foreign policy that has ruffled feathers in its neighborhood recently			1
as the @entity14 opened in @entity0 , vice minister of foreign affairs @entity13 warned that the country had sent an " important signal " to the region that it would respond " decisively " to provocations on territorial disputes			1
that means we can expect @entity0 to continue with its " reactive assertiveness " foreign policy tactic			1
@entity3 has perfected this approach in its ongoing maritime disputes in the @entity26 and @entity27			1
the approach allows @entity0 to use perceived provocations as a chance to change the status quo in its favor -- all the while insisting the other party started the trouble			1
in @entity0 's eyes , it is a means of satisfying domestic pressure for a tougher foreign policy to match its economic might , all while trying to cling to the mantra of peaceful development			1
but this juggling act does not always work , and a number of countries in the region are giving up on the notion of a peacefully rising @entity3			2
the prolonged deadlock with @entity50 over the sovereignty of a few islets offers a vivid example of this approach			0
in september , the @entity50 government bought from a private owner three of the disputed islands -- called @entity58 by @entity50 and @entity58 by @entity3 -- in the @entity59			2
@entity50 says it purchased the islands to prevent the hardline @entity62 mayor from acquiring them and carrying out a plan to build there			0
@entity0 interpreted the move as a betrayal of the two countries ' agreement to shelve the dispute , and the subsequent months witnessed a string of @entity3 retaliations that have kept tensions in the @entity59 simmering			1
@entity3 's retaliatory measures , termed " combination punches " by the state media , ranged from the verbal -- leaders labeling @entity50 's purchase of the islands a " farce " and vowing to " never yield an inch " -- to economic pressure , large - scale anti-japan protests and naval exercises in the @entity59			1
but the game - changer came when @entity0 declared its territorial baselines around the islands , a move that legally places them under @entity3 administration			1
once the announcement was made , @entity3 began to regularly dispatch law enforcement vessels to patrol waters off the disputed islands , directly challenging @entity50 's de facto control of the area for the past 40 years			1
such is the new normal , claim @entity3 officials			2
but @entity0 did not stop there			2
it sent a reconnaissance flight directly over the disputed islands , and @entity50 responded by scrambling fighter jets			0
the @entity3 navy and air force have intensified their reconnaissance missions and drills in the @entity59 and , according to @entity50 , even locked weapons - guiding radar on @entity50 military assets , claims @entity3 denied			2
despite these actions , officials in @entity0 have repeatedly stated that @entity62 started all the troubles and must accept full blame			2
now , analysts in @entity0 claim that a " @entity115 " has been opened , and there is no going back to the tacit agreement that has kept peace in the @entity59 for decades			2
similar heavy - handed action was used against the @entity117 in a spat over the @entity119 in the @entity120 in april 2012			0
when @entity121 maladroitly responded to a fishing run - in by sending a warship , @entity3 took the opportunity to strengthen its claim over the disputed shoal by deploying law enforcement vessels to the area , extending its annual unilateral fishing ban to cover the waters around the shoal ; quarantining tropical fruit imports from the @entity117 and suspending tourism ; and roping off the mouth of the lagoon to keep out other fishermen			0
by maintaining regular law enforcement patrols and preventing @entity117 fishermen from entering those waters , @entity3 has managed to establish a new status quo in its favor			0
a similar blueprint was then used in response to a maritime law passed by @entity144 in june 2012 that covered the disputed @entity145 and @entity146			0
before the ink on the law had dried , @entity3 upgraded the administrative status of @entity150 , encompassing a group of disputed islands in the @entity120 , and established a military garrison			0
the development of @entity150 has continued apace			0
following the central government 's provision of 10 billion yuan ( $ 1.6 billion ) for the construction of the city , @entity150 officials are said to be considering plans to build more ports , open casinos and create an offshore tax haven			0
by all accounts , new leader @entity165 has played a key role in crafting @entity3 's response in its maritime disputes and was central to @entity0 's response to @entity50 's island purchase announcement			1
he was put in charge of a maritime security leading group in mid- 2012 , then the " office to respond to the @entity176 " in september			0
after taking control of both the communist party and the military in november , his rhetoric essentially formalized the reactive assertive tactic by repeating the importance of " peaceful development " while pledging zero tolerance for those who would harm @entity3 's " sovereignty , security or development interests			1
" that is not to say that @entity0 is necessarily looking for external troubles , as it remains preoccupied with maintaining the momentum of economic development and preventing domestic problems from erupting into potentially destabilizing unrest			0
but unfortunately , there is little appetite in @entity0 for blunting the edge of @entity3 's " reactively assertive " foreign policy			1
if anything , opinions are going the other way			0
as @entity13 , vice minister for foreign affairs , put it : when facing provocations , the @entity3 public " hopes that @entity3 will be even more assertive			1
" if there is any perceived slight , no matter how minor , expect @entity3 to pounce			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

@entity3 has warned it will respond " decisively " to provocations on territorial disputes
there are signs @entity0 will stick to its policy of " reactive assertiveness "
@entity3 's leaders are meeting at the @entity14 in @entity0
@entity165 is expected to formally assume @entity3 's presidency
