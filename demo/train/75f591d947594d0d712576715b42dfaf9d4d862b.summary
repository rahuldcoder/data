-- first he mocked him , then he praised him and now @entity4 president @entity3 has handed @entity5 his best chance of winning his second @entity8 award			1
for in an unexpected move , the world governing body extended the deadline for national team coaches and captains , as well as participating journalists , to vote for their top three players of 2013			0
the initial date had been last friday , just hours after the first legs of the @entity19 play - offs had ended , but the closing date to vote for this year 's @entity22 winner is now november 29			1
the reason given for the delay has been the ' low turnout of votes ' so far			0
with @entity27 , who has won the last four crowns , out injured , @entity5 will never have a better chance to impress a panel for an award where form at voting time often counts as much as previous exploits in the year			1
fresh from his stunning hat - trick which fired @entity39 to the @entity40 when eliminating @entity41 4 - 2 on aggregate ( with @entity5 scoring all his nation 's goals in the tie ) , the @entity36 star may begin to feel that his recent row with @entity4 is beginning to turn his way			1
last month , @entity3 was involved in an extraordinary impersonation of the @entity50 star while addressing the famous @entity51 in @entity52 , during which he claimed @entity5 spent " a lot more at the hairdresser 's " than his @entity56 rival @entity27			2
@entity5 swiftly hit back , writing on his @entity58 page how the video showed " the respect and consideration that @entity4 has for me , my club and my country			2
" on tuesday night , @entity3 -- who has been watching his words carefully since -- was effusive in his praise for the former @entity69 player 's match - winning display in @entity41			0
" fantastic performance by @ @entity5 , " the @entity70 tweeted			0
hours later , it was announced that the voting had been extended , meaning @entity5 's stunning @entity75 display can now be taken into account			1
quite what @entity78 international @entity77 makes of it all is anyone 's guess , with the @entity84 star having been tipped to win the award when voting was thought to have ended last week			1
he is now behind the @entity50 in the running according to widespread opinion , as is @entity27 -- with the @entity89 seemingly a victim of his own staggeringly high performances of recent years			0
@entity41 's @entity92 and @entity94 @entity93 are outsiders to win the award , with @entity4 having named a 23 - man list of players to be considered for the prize in october			1
the three - man shortlist for the award will be announced next month , with the winner of the 2013 @entity22 set to be unveiled at an awards ceremony in @entity104 in january			2
in a separate development , @entity4 announced on wednesday that " fair working conditions must be introduced quickly , consistently and on a sustained basis in @entity108 , " the @entity110 host nation			0
the statement followed a meeting in @entity104 between @entity3 and the @entity113 , and came shortly after an @entity115 report suggested that worker abuse is rife in @entity108 's construction sector			0
in response to @entity115 's allegations , the director of the @entity119 at @entity108 's @entity120 said laws are in place to protect workers from mistreatment .			0

@entity4 *surprisingly* extend voting for @entity22 by two weeks
new deadline means @entity5 's @entity40 hat - trick can now be taken into account
@entity77 had been *favorite* to win award for various *critics* prior to unexpected change
