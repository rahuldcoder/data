-- @entity1 went to the polls friday in the country 's first parliamentary elections since adopting a new constitution following mass protests over unemployment and corruption			1
turnout in the @entity12 country was 45 % , the @entity9 said			1
both @entity13 and the prime minister have greater powers under the new constitution , while the monarch 's sway has been slightly lessened			2
more than 300 international observers monitored the voting , alongside 3,500 @entity1 observers , the semiofficial @entity19 newspaper reported			1
@entity1 's moderate @entity23 ( @entity24 ) is expected to do well in the vote			1
@entity26 , senior lecturer in @entity27 at the @entity28 in @entity29 , told @entity0 the elections were important because " they are exciting for the first time			1
" after years in which the results have been predictable , this time more is at stake and the outcome may signal whether the population is happy with the monarchy or not , storm said			2
if people voted for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties , that would suggest they want to maintain the status quo , she said , whereas more votes for the @entity24 would signal a desire for greater change			1
" we do n't know who 's going to win for once , " she said			0
@entity52 , 29 , a business owner in @entity53 who would give only her first name , told @entity0 she did not expect a great deal to change as a result of the elections			1
" i do n't expect this to be a historical turn , " she said			0
" i am waiting for real changes from the government			0
as long as parties controlled by the palace will be around , and @entity65 , the king 's private secretary , will dominate the economy , nothing will change for me			1
" she said the @entity24 's pledge to fight corruption was appealing but she does not subscribe to its ideology , so her vote was likely to go to the @entity73 as the " less bad " option			0
others were less motivated to use their ballot			0
" i am not going to vote for people who do n't care about my fate , " one taxi driver said			0
" today , i am not going to the polls			0
" the elections were first set for september 2012 , but they were rescheduled after negotiations between the @entity9 , which oversees elections , and some 20 political parties			1
under the constitutional changes approved in july , the country 's prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes , rather than @entity93 selecting his own nominee for the job			2
however , he is not obliged to choose the leader of the winning party , @entity98 said , which gives him more room to maneuver			0
also , the number of political parties involved means that a coalition government is almost inevitable , she said			0
the @entity24 is more moderate than @entity104 's governing @entity24 or the @entity105 who won power in @entity109 elections last month , @entity98 said			2
the constitutional changes came after thousands of @entity1 took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year , inspired by what became known as the @entity113			1
the youth - based february 20 movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies			0
economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country 's young people , particularly many university graduates who are unemployed , @entity98 said			2
journalist @entity124 in @entity53 contributed to this report .			0

new : turnout is 45 % , the @entity9 says
the poll is important as a *reflection* of the desire for change , an *analyst* says
the elections are the first to be held since protests forced constitutional reform
@entity1 has not seen the same major *upheaval* as some other countries in the region
