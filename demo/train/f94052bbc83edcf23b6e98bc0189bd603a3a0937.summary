-- after an extensive , month - long buildup , @entity1 has finally unveiled its new logo			1
overall the look is cleaner and thinner , and it is a new sans - serif typeface created by @entity1			2
the logo is still purple , though a shade darker , and features all the usual uppercase letters in the same order finished off by the signature exclamation point , which dances around in some versions			1
@entity1 posted two flavors of the new look to its @entity13 at midnight on thursday			2
one is white text on a purple background , the other purple text on white background			0
both have a slight beveled effect , though it 's more noticeable on the purple text			0
it has already replaced the logo that appears on the top left corner of @entity1			1
" we knew we wanted a logo that reflected @entity1 - whimsical , yet sophisticated			1
modern and fresh , with a nod to our history			0
having a human touch , personal			0
@entity31 , " wrote ceo @entity29 in a blog post on @entity13 , which @entity1 bought earlier this year			2
" we did n't want to have any straight lines in the logo			2
straight lines do n't exist in the human form and are extremely rare in nature , so the human touch in the logo is that all the lines and forms all have at least a slight curve , " @entity34 added in her post , which goes into exhaustive detail about the thinking behind the logo			0
in a recent internal poll of @entity1 employees , 87 % wanted the logo changed , @entity34 said			1
@entity1 managed to turn a simple rebranding into an impressive marketing push by dragging it out for 30 days			1
for the past month , the company has rotated out the logo on its homepage daily with one of the runnersup			2
some of the 29 logos were a lot more unusual than the final choice , perhaps to make fans appreciate the reserved simplicity of the final look			0
" sharing these logo variations prepares people for change , so there 's less risk of what happened to gap , " said @entity64 , a graphic designer specializing in brand identity			0
when @entity73 tried changing its logo in 2010 , there was an outcry among @entity73 loyalists and logo enthusiasts			0
the clothing company eventually caved and switched back to its old logo			2
@entity1 's logo redesign was headed up by an in - house branding group and product designers , according to @entity83			1
it is likely just one of the more noticeable elements of a larger rebranding effort for the struggling company , which @entity34 has re-energized since becoming ceo last year			1
" the logo is only part of a brand new branding and image campaign			2
it signals to consumers , investors and employees that change is coming , " said @entity94 business school professor @entity93			0
the new logo is probably not different enough to raise much ire ( or eyebrows ) among @entity1 users , although some internet critics were unimpressed			1
on @entity107 , the reaction to the logo was less than enthusiastic			0
" the new @entity1 logo looks like it got run through @entity109 on @entity110			1
" a bad logo is all it took for @entity1 to make everyone talk about it , " tweeted @entity112 , editor of design publication @entity113			1
@entity1 has n't updated its logo since 2009 , and it has been mostly the same since 1995			1
the move to change it now is logical given its @entity34 's recent attempts to breathe new life into the brand			0
" more often than not , when a company 's identity looks a little tired ( or more likely when new leadership wants to put their own stamp on things ) , what 's already in place wo n't need to be thrown out			0
it 'll just need to be freshened up , " said @entity64 .			0

after 30 days of *teasers* , @entity1 has unveiled its new logo
the font is different but much of the logo , *including* exclamation point , are the same
the logo is part of a larger rebranding effort by the company
