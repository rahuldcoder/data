-- while hosting @entity0 's @entity2 this week , i said : " republicans are practically cheering for @entity4 today			1
he 's given them a new excuse to bash president @entity8			1
" i pointed out that @entity3 have been slamming @entity8 for his handling of the @entity11 crisis even though i have not heard a single , specific way in which they would handle the situation differently			1
no new ideas , just new insults			0
the howls came quickly , and my assertion has been repeatedly attacked and mischaracterized			0
but the evidence to support it is , troublingly , everywhere			2
i 'm not saying republicans are pro-putin or that they want him to invade @entity11			1
but they certainly have — conveniently , even gleefully -- found a good way to put @entity4 's actions to political use at home			1
just listen to former @entity26 mayor @entity25 on monday : " @entity4 decides what he wants to do and he does it in half a day ... he makes a decision and he executes it			1
that 's what you call a leader			2
" and @entity36 : " people are looking at @entity4 as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil ; they look at our president as one who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates			1
" @entity3 leaders are not only bashing @entity8 , but appearing to praise @entity4			1
there 's more : sen. @entity49 , @entity50 , seemed to blame the @entity11 crisis on @entity8 , telling the @entity52 this week , " this is the ultimate result of a feckless foreign policy in which nobody believes in @entity57 's strength anymore			1
" sen. @entity60 , @entity62 - @entity61 , has weighed in : " we have a weak and indecisive president that invites aggression , " as did rep. @entity63 , @entity64 : " emboldened by president @entity8 's trembling inaction , @entity4 has invaded the @entity59 region of @entity11			1
" and on and on			0
opinion : 5 lessons for a new @entity72 listen , there 's nothing wrong with criticizing the president 's policy positions or actions			1
to hold a president 's feet to the fire over every aspect of government is the job not only of our elected leaders but of all citizens			2
substantive dissent is indeed patriotic			0
but substantive dissent is not what we have here			0
we have baseless , petty politics that are ultimately counterproductive to @entity57 's global standing			2
on saturday , sen. @entity91 , @entity92 , published a list of steps he thinks @entity8 should take to " punish @entity95			2
" they included calling @entity95 's actions an invasion — which , um , secretary of state @entity99 actually did the same day that @entity91 made his demand — and sending @entity99 to @entity101 , which was announced a day later			0
the ranking @entity3 on the @entity102 , sen. @entity103 , @entity104 , called for immediate sanctions against @entity95 -- but the @entity106 under @entity8 's direction was already drafting a package of stiff sanctions			1
@entity3 have also called for visa bans for @entity95 leaders and asset freezes			2
well , on sunday , @entity99 said , " there could even be , ultimately , asset freezes , visa bans			0
there could be certainly disruption of any of the normal trade routine			0
there could be business drawback on investment in the country			0
" he said the major world powers are " going to isolate @entity95 " and " all options are on the table			0
" @entity57 paves way for sanctions on @entity95 , @entity11 over @entity59 if the @entity8 administration is already acting on the initiatives that its @entity3 critics are demanding in response to the @entity11 crisis , why are they complaining ? because , they allege , it 's because @entity8 has been so weak for five years that @entity4 thought he could get away with invading @entity11			1
let 's look at that argument more closely			0
in august 2008 , @entity4 invaded the @entity139 while @entity140 was @entity141			2
where were the " weakness " complaints from @entity3 ? well , conservative columnist @entity145 — who has said that in the @entity11 situation @entity8 's " inaction created a vacuum " and who derided the president 's statements on @entity11 as " weak " — said of the @entity139 invasion back in 2008 , " well , obviously it 's beyond our control			1
there is nothing that will stop them			0
" conservative @entity160 national security staffer @entity159 exuded a similar calm in 2008 : " there 's no easy answer ; there 's only tough choices ... @entity95 is a tough nut to crack			0
" apparently when a @entity169 is president the situation is much simpler			0
last friday , @entity159 explained that the @entity95 invasion of @entity59 is proof that " this administration 's policy toward @entity95 has been a failure			0
there 's another aspect to this @entity3 hypocrisy			1
@entity49 recently called @entity8 " the most naïve president in history " because of his foreign policy tactics			1
and yet it was @entity140 who famously said , upon meeting @entity4 , " i looked the man in the eye			2
i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy , and we had a very good dialogue			0
i was able to get a sense of his soul			0
" did @entity3 find him " weak " ? " @entity188 " ? contrast this with @entity8 , who , against considerable odds , wrangled @entity95 into a constructive role on @entity193 sanctions , @entity195 chemical weapons removal and a new start treaty			1
it is not merely laughable to call this president , who has unfortunately expanded the use of drone warfare and who also ordered the mission to kill @entity203 , " weak			0
" it is also self - destructive to our national interest , since absent any substantive disagreements , it reveals only national disunity in the face of a global crisis			0
it 's what @entity3 might call -- if the other party were doing it — poor leadership			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			2

@entity219 : i was slammed for saying @entity3 practically cheering @entity4 while bashing @entity8
but evidence *abounds* , in remarks by @entity49 , @entity25 , many commentators , she says
she says @entity8 already doing what @entity3 *suggests* on @entity11
@entity219 : @entity3 's hypocrisy , criticism of president is destructive
