-- coinciding with this season 's flu outbreak is an upsurge of another illness that can be dangerous , even deadly , especially for infants : respiratory syncytial virus ( @entity7 )			1
while most parents are familiar with the flu , many have never heard of @entity7			1
it 's the same virus that is the leading cause of the common cold -- and infects almost all children by age 2			1
" the vast majority of kids who get @entity7 just have cold symptoms and get better , " says dr. @entity15 , @entity16 president of the @entity17			1
" a minority of them develop bronchiolitis ( an inflammation of tiny air passages in the lungs specific to babies and young children ) -- and a very small percentage have significant problems			1
" when @entity7 attacks the lungs , it is particularly dangerous for newborns and babies born prematurely			1
pneumonia and other bronchial complications can set in quickly			2
@entity7 and other winter worries it is an age - old , recurring illness -- most adults have been exposed countless times			1
subsequent @entity7 infections usually are not as severe as the first			1
@entity7 , which generally circulates from late fall into the early spring , is out there with a myriad of other stuff floating around right now : human metapneumovirus ( @entity47 ) , adenovirus and parainfluenza , all common respiratory viruses , and pertussis , the bacterial disease that causes whooping cough			1
since patients often are treated without being tested , it 's hard to know what 's what			2
" just in general , when we look at cough and respiratory symptoms , there 's a lot of overlap , " said dr. @entity58 , an epidemiologist at the @entity59 ( @entity59 )			2
" a lot of times , unless there is rigorous laboratory testing , you may not know the cause			0
" vitamin d in pregnancy may protect infants from virus with no official reporting of @entity7 , year - to - year comparisons are difficult to gauge except to say spikes are typical this time of year			1
in @entity82 , a city hit hard by the flu , @entity79 has more than 175 cases of @entity7 on the record so far this season			1
at the three pediatric hospitals that make up @entity88 of @entity89 , some 545 youngsters have been treated for @entity7 since the beginning of december , according to the group 's clinical microbiologist , dr. @entity91			1
@entity94 's 2 - month - old son , @entity93 , recently spent three days in an @entity89 hospital			2
" i brought him in because he was wheezing and coughing , " she says			0
" he had just learned to smile -- and he stopped smiling			0
" @entity15 advises , " you are the best judge of your child -- if it does n't seem right to you , you should bring them in			0
" serious symptoms parents should seek immediate medical attention if their children have any of these symptoms : -- high fever -- severe cough -- wheezing -- difficulty breathing -- bluish - colored skin on the lips and nail beds @entity7 spreads much like the flu -- exposure from others who are coughing or sneezing and by direct skin - to - skin contact			1
the virus can live for hours on contaminated surfaces such as toys			2
it is most contagious during first few days of infection			0
treatment @entity124 coldlike symptoms can be alleviated with proper humidity , over-the - counter pain relievers , nasal drops and extra fluids			0
hospital treatment for serious cases may include antibiotics , iv fluids and humidified oxygen			2
medications delivered in a fine mist can relieve wheezing			0
@entity137 tested positive for @entity7 but responded quickly following a procedure to clear his lungs of congestion			1
" it was a little scary			0
i 'm grateful to all of the nurses and doctors who kept me calm , " his mother says			0
prevention parents should take the same precautions for all respiratory illnesses : wash hands , limit contact with others who are sick , do n't smoke and keep surfaces clean			0
for babies at highest risk -- those born prematurely , with congenital heart or lung disease -- there is one medication to help ward it off : doctors may administer a series of injections ( @entity163 ) as a protective measure			0
but it 's an expensive treatment not indicated for general use			0
preventive actions do pay off , @entity15 says			0
" the number of fatalities from @entity7 has dropped significantly in recent years			2
" there currently is no vaccine for @entity7			2
but " we are hopeful , " @entity58 says			0
" there are multiple candidates for a vaccine in development			0

@entity7 is caused by the same virus that 's the leading cause of the common cold
most children recover without complications , but some have " significant problems "
serious cases may require hospitalization
