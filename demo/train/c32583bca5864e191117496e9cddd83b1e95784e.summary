" a third man , @entity59 drifter @entity17 , was convicted separately of the killing			0
@entity61 admitted having sexual relations with @entity40 but denied killing her			0
judge @entity63 said in the paperwork published thursday that it was not up to the jury to reconstruct what had happened			0
