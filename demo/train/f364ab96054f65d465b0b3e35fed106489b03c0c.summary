-- look guys , sometimes box office articles just need four headlines ! in this case , the under - performance of " the five - year engagement " was n't the only big story this weekend			1
" @entity12 " notched a very strong sophomore frame , " @entity14 " reached a truly remarkable milestone , and " @entity11 " flexed their muscles internationally			0
oh , and " safe " and " @entity17 " also entered theaters			0
we 've got a lot to talk about ! here 's how the box office shook out : ensemble comedy " @entity12 , " an adaptation of @entity28 's famous advice book , " @entity25 , " dropped by 46 percent to $ 18 million -- enough to easily top the box office for a second frame in a row			1
compared to other comedies with predominantly @entity33 - @entity32 casts , " @entity12 's " second weekend drop is quite strong			1
recent titles like " @entity35 " and @entity37 's " @entity36 " fell by 55 percent and 54 percent , respectively , in their sophomore frames			0
" @entity12 " maintained a robust per theater average of $ 8,933 , which was over twice as much as the average for any other film in the @entity42			1
after ten days , think has earned $ 60.9 million , and it now seems headed for a finish near $ 90 million			0
not too shabby for a film that cost @entity46 just $ 12 million to produce ! @entity14 : get the latest news , photos , and more there 's another @entity46 title in second place			2
@entity53 's " the @entity52 ! band of @entity55 " earned $ 11.4 million over its first three days			1
the $ 55 million stop - motion animation has already earned $ 63.7 million overseas , so it did n't need a gigantic debut stateside to sail to profitability			2
the film , which earned a " b " cinemascore grade benefited greatly from the lack of other family films at the box office			1
76 percent of " @entity52 ' " audience were children under 12 ( 49 percent ) and parents ( 27 percent ) , and it 's big friday - to - saturday jump from $ 2.8 million to $ 5.1 million ( 85 percent ) is indicative of family playability			1
interestingly , despite the beardy cast and swashbuckling storyline , only 46 percent of the audience was male , though , which means that women made up the predominant audience for the @entity77 films at the box office this weekend			1
the @entity81 / @entity80 romance " @entity82 " finished in third place with $ 11.3 million -- a drop of 50 percent			2
after ten days , the @entity86 adaptation has earned $ 39.9 million -- already a much better total than the last @entity81 - led picture , " @entity88 , " which grossed just $ 31.2 million in its entire 2010 run			2
close behind , " @entity14 " dipped by a tiny 23 percent and earned $ 11.3 million in its sixth weekend on the chart			2
with a running total of $ 372.5 million , the franchise - launching blockbuster is now officially performing ahead of the highest - grossing " @entity94 " film , " @entity94 and the @entity96 -- part 2 , " which had earned $ 366 million at the same point in its run			2
worldwide , " @entity105 ' " impressive $ 601 million total does n't compare to @entity94 's grosses , but one can only wonder how high numbers will climb by the time " @entity104 : catching fire -- part 2 " ( @entity109 ) in @entity110 finally hits theaters in 2016			0
" the five - year engagement " settled for a fifth place debut ( although every movie from no. 2 to no. 5 could shuffle around over the next 24 hours ) with $ 11.2 million			1
while many prognosticators ( like this one ) thought the film would top the chart , @entity115 claims it was always expecting an opening in the low double - digits			0
still , the result seems very disappointing given the massive success of " bridesmaids , " which earned $ 169 million last year , and the date night - viability of 2012 titles like " @entity126 " and " @entity82			1
" the @entity129 / @entity128 rom - com earned a lackluster " b - " cinemascore grade from polled audiences , which were 64 percent female			0
fortunately , the film cost a modest $ 30 million to produce			0
two thrillers failed to ignite much excitement at the box office this weekend			1
@entity138 's latest , " @entity144 , " notched a weak $ 7.7 million -- a low start even for @entity138 -- while @entity141 's @entity140 - themed effort " @entity17 " could n't escape its sepulcher down by the sea			2
it found only $ 7.3 million			0
audiences gave " safe " a " b + " cinemascore grade and " @entity17 " a " @entity149 " overseas , the big story is @entity151 's " @entity11 , " which broke the opening weekend record in 12 countries , including @entity154 ( $ 15.9 million ) and @entity155 ( $ 11.3 million )			0
the @entity157 - distributed superhero title has now grossed a stunning $ 178.4 million in just five days -- and it still has n't hit powerhouse markets @entity159 , @entity160 , or @entity161			0
this bodes very well for " @entity11 ' " @entity32 debut next weekend			0
will it break the opening weekend record ? 1			0
@entity12 -- $ 18 million 2			1
the @entity52 ! band of @entity55 -- $ 11.4 million 3			1
