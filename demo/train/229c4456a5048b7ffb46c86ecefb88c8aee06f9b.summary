-- twice she has been felled by life - threatening illnesses -- a brain tumor and then cancer -- and twice @entity5 has recovered			1
for her , the secret to recovering full health is simple -- a love of horses			1
" horses were the cure when i was ill , " says the veteran trainer , a pioneering female figure in the male - dominated racing world			1
" with the brain tumor , the doctor told me life was 50 - 50 , a one - in - two chance , " she added , reflecting on her first serious illness in 1990			0
" for me , that was enough of a chance to come back			0
it 's like a race , you 're never beaten until you cross the finishing line			1
" a month after surgery to remove the brain tumor , she was back working with the horses in her stable -- and did the same again following her cancer scare in 2005			0
" they were my drug , my cure , " says @entity5 , whose horse @entity30 will compete in sunday 's prestigious @entity32 in @entity33 , where she won by five lengths last year to claim @entity37 racing 's biggest prize			1
" i 'm not scared of dying , i 've had a fantastic life and do n't have any worries			0
a lot of people have cancer and die young but i 'm 66 and have had a fantastic life			0
if i go , i go			0
i 'm in life to be positive and it 's important to be positive for the people around you			1
" @entity53 to @entity52 's resilience are some impressive genes which suggest she wo n't be shuffling off @entity56 anytime soon -- her father , the esteemed former trainer @entity57 , celebrated his 90th birthday in august and is still going strong			1
the family has been an integral force in @entity62 flat racing since @entity63 , a former @entity64 jockey , relocated to @entity62 towards the end of the 19th century			1
their association with the @entity68 began with his son , another @entity69 , who trained @entity70 to victory two years after the @entity65 and again triumphed in 1966 with @entity72			0
in turn , his son @entity57 was a four - time winning trainer ( 1952 , 1959 , 1976 and 1981 ) while grandson @entity75 rode four winners -- the last of which was his sister @entity78 's first success in 1979 , @entity80 -- a horse owned by their mother			1
for @entity52 -- christened @entity83 but known from an early age as @entity78 after her parents took to the name of one of their friends ' daughters -- it was a remarkable start to her career as a trainer			2
it came barely a year after she had been awarded her horse - training license			2
growing up , she rode on her pony to the stables each day with her father , telling him of her dream to follow in his footsteps			0
" he just said , ' no , it would n't happen , ' " she recalls			0
" you have to remember i was born in 1948 and there were no women trainers at all			2
that just did not exist			0
but from very young , that 's all i wanted to be			2
i worked my whole life for that			0
" sent to boarding school in @entity64 to learn the language , she was miserable			0
rather than study , she spent her time leafing through copies of @entity112 to check the form and ensure she did not miss a trick in flat racing			2
a seven - year stint in @entity117 from 1967 ensured she is trilingual , able to switch between the three languages as quickly as @entity30 's turn of pace on the gallops			1
but she missed @entity62 , with the lure of home and horses proving too much			0
her first equine job at home was as a bloodstock agent before becoming her father 's assistant and then applying for her license in 1978 , a female trailblazer along with compatriot @entity131 , who applied for a license at a similar age and still trains today			1
@entity63 - @entity5 's list of victories since have been impressive -- virtually every race imaginable on @entity62 soil , as well as a host of international ones , most notably in @entity64 with the @entity142 ( four times ) , the @entity144 and the @entity145			1
but the standout wins are the two @entity147 , 34 years apart			0
" when i won in 1979 , i did n't think when will i win it again ? " she says			2
" i had horses that ran well some years but it was a case of if i win it , i win it			2
for me , it was no problem not to win it			2
it 's a hard race , the race that everyone wants to win			1
" it 's the best race in @entity37 , actually for me it 's the best race in the world			1
okay , there 's more money with the @entity160 but this has got an aura that no other race possesses			2
it 's something special and , between my family , we 've been lucky to have won it a few times			2
" @entity52 finds it impossible to pick her favorite @entity32 winner , akin to picking a favorite child			1
she bought @entity80 in @entity64 on behalf of her mother , while @entity30 -- the filly now owned by sheik @entity173 , a member of the @entity175 royal family -- was bred by her father			1
" i have had a few bad years so to then have @entity30 ... " she says trailing off , almost silenced by the impression arguably the best filly she has ever seen has had on her			1
@entity179 , @entity173 's jockey of choice , has been replaced by @entity181 , who rides @entity30 regularly and was on board for last year 's success			1
it was a difficult discussion with @entity179 , who she calls " a very nice boy that understood by point of view , " arguing the blow may have been softened by @entity30 's relatively lackluster displays of late			1
" @entity30 will go to the @entity32 whatever , " says @entity5 of the filly 's race chances at @entity192			1
" she is not what she was last year because she 's had problems with her foot and back			1
but she 's fine , she 's getting better			2
she is a fine champion whatever happens but how will she go ? i do n't know			0
" whether @entity30 can become the first horse since alleged , originally ridden by brother @entity75 and father @entity57 , in 1978 to pull off a successful defense is the $ 5 million question in a race with a purse to match that sum			1
@entity52 insists she is not driven to match the four @entity32 wins of her father -- " it 's difficult to do what he has done " -- and she still leans on him for advice as she always done			1
she still follows his old - school methods of feeding the horses just oats , carrots and artichokes and not using supplements			0
he , though , was reluctant to let her train , she says because of a fear she might fail , and he protected her in those early years			0
" everyone thought he was just training the horses so , when i made mistakes and they did n't run well , everyone thought it was him , " she says			0
" although with that he was also credited with the wins			0
but i did n't mind , i knew what i had done			0
" for me , i do n't see him so much anymore but i will always listen to him			0
" @entity63 - @entity5 now has the full run of @entity230 , the @entity63 base bought by her father and grandfather in 1958			1
it was a rundown property , left to ruin after the @entity235 and their commander for @entity237 -- who used it as their base -- were eventually driven out of @entity62			0
even today , some of the bunkers remain			0
" we could n't blow those up , " she says matter - of - factly			0
her grandfather was virtually speechless when he first viewed the property , thinking it would ruin the family			0
but the entire site was rebuilt and has become a horse - racing empire in the intervening five and a half decades			1
she was 10 when she arrived there , for her it has always been home , a lifetime surrounded by horses , and not once has she ever felt claustrophobic in the equine world			2
a suggestion that she might ever have been tempted to escape such a life leads to a baffled response			0
" escape ? ! no , i love it too much and there 's still so much to achieve			2
i want to win the @entity266 and every year is different , " she says referring to @entity265 's most prestigious race			1
" i 'm not ready to stop			0

@entity5 remains a key figure in racing despite two serious health scares
the trainer of last year 's @entity32 winner @entity30 , she is once more aiming to win
she is part of a racing *dynasty* that has been a dominant force in the @entity32 for decades
something of a trailblazer , she was one of the world 's first female *racehorse* trainers
