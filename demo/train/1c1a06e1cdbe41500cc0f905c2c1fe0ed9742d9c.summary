@entity0 -- we 're at a soup kitchen in a shabby back street in @entity0 , next to the canal @entity6 , near the @entity8 s metro stop			1
hundreds of homeless people are queuing up for some hot food and a coffee			2
most of them are from @entity14 ; many from @entity16 and @entity17			1
among them are dozens of children , their grimy faces , vacant stares and worn clothes redolent of months on the road			2
some have walked hundreds of miles to escape the violence of @entity16			1
they have been told to get to @entity8 s metro in @entity0 and they will be looked after			1
often the people - traffickers dump them here , feeling they have fulfilled their part of the bargain : to get them to the @entity32			1
we talked to two 14 - year - olds who do n't want to go on camera			2
they had arrived that day from @entity37 , after traveling through @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
the story they told us is typical : their families paid thousands of dollars to send them to the west in the hands of smugglers			1
the journey was extremely perilous			1
they traveled in the backs of trucks , cars and at times walking across mountain ranges ; it took them nine months to get to @entity0			1
like many of the children we spoke to , they risked frostbite during their dangerous traversing of mountains in @entity38 and @entity39			0
they claimed @entity38 border guards shot at them as they crossed the frontier			0
but despite of the risks they kept going -- lured by the promises of lucrative jobs in @entity71			0
the reality when they arrive is very different			2
most of them are aged between 14 and 18 years old			0
theoretically the @entity71 state has a duty of care for unaccompanied minors , but these teenagers must prove their age			1
often they do n't have the documents necessary to show their age , and so they are left to sleep on the streets			1
one charity , @entity71 @entity85 ( @entity71 : @entity86 ) is trying to help , but it is hopelessly overwhelmed			0
the group estimates that some 6,000 foreign children arrive illegally in @entity71 each year -- most turn up in @entity0 expecting to be able to work to send money home to their families			1
that is , of course , illegal , so there are faced with entering the black market or surviving on handouts			0
the lucky ones may get a place in a reception center run by a charity			0
we filmed at one hostel which has just 25 beds			0
when we were there , 45 children turned up needing somewhere to sleep			0
it was cold and raining and only the youngest were admitted			0
the rest were forced to once again sleep on the streets			2
@entity112 is typical : he spent three months sleeping in a park before finally getting a hotel room provided by the @entity71 state , once he was able to prove he was 16 years old			1
he was lucky : his sister was able to fax a copy of his birth certificate			0
but many of his friends are still sleeping outside , because they ca n't prove their age			2
he tells me about the frequent fights between different ethnics groups -- @entity126 beaten by @entity127 , pashtuns clashing with @entity17			0
muggings , drug abuse and the ever present sex - trade were all daily risks for him			0
his story is a microcosm of the problems that have consumed @entity16 for three decades : he was orphaned by war and disease -- his father was killed by the @entity143 , his mother died of tuberculosis			2
his uncle physically abused him for years until finally his brother - in - law agreed to lend him $ 6,000 so he could buy his passage to the west , but on arriving in @entity0 , his dreams of a job and a new life were quickly shattered			1
now he has begun to make a start on improving his life , learning @entity71 , and getting his first taste of the internet			0
his prospects remain bleak , but at least he has a bed to sleep in each night -- unlike so many of the other @entity16 children who are surviving on the streets of @entity0 .			1

@entity16 families *pay* thousands of dollars to send youngsters to the @entity32
journey is perilous and can take many months
teenagers arrive in @entity0 with dreams of working to send money back home
instead , unable to prove their age , many find themselves living on the streets
