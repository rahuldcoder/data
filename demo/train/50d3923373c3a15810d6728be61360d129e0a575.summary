he was also involved in the second goal five minutes later , with @entity17 forward @entity90 following up after his strike partner was denied by @entity10 goalkeeper @entity92			2

blog : @entity109 take huge gamble on @entity115 @entity122 midfielder @entity121 scored for the second successive match with a superb free - kick in the 36th minute , while @entity20 striker @entity125 then doubled the lead in first - half injury - time with a penalty after @entity109 defender @entity128 was ruled to have pulled his shirt			1

@entity137 boss @entity145 , who faces court action by tax authorities next month , was left frustrated in his 500th @entity2 match as a manager -- though his team equaled their club record of five consecutive clean sheets			2
@entity155 's under - pressure manager @entity153 also suffered a disappointing end to a miserable week as his team , who were knocked out of the @entity158 by second division strugglers @entity160 , were held 1 - 1 at 10th - placed @entity161			0
blog : how long can @entity155 keep faith with @entity153 ? the visitors , missing the injured key trio of @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 , led in the 57th minute through @entity171 defender @entity170 ' first goal for the club , but @entity174 center - back @entity173 snatched a point for @entity161 with seconds remaining			2
