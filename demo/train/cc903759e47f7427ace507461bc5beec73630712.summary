a suburban @entity1 school district is now looking at the public postings on social media by middle and high school students , searching for possible violence , drug use , bullying , truancy and suicidal threats			1
the district in @entity11 , @entity12 , is paying $ 40,500 to a firm to monitor and report on 14,000 middle and high school students ' posts on @entity16 , @entity17 and other social media for one year			1
though critics liken the monitoring to government stalking , school officials and their contractor say the purpose is student safety			1
as classes began this fall , the district awarded the contract after it earlier paid the firm , @entity28 , $ 5,000 last spring to conduct a pilot project monitoring 9,000 students at three high schools and a middle school			1
among the results was a successful intervention with a student " who was speaking of ending his life " on his social media , said @entity39 , ceo of the firm			1
that intervention was significant because two students in the district committed suicide the past two years , said superintendent @entity43			1
the suicides occurred at a time when @entity12 has reduced mental health services in schools , @entity43 said			1
" we were able to save a life , " @entity43 said , adding the two recent suicides were n't outside the norm for school districts			2
" it 's just another avenue to open up a dialogue with parents about safety			2
" teacher suspended after giving student a @entity16 lesson in another recent incident , a student posted a photo of what appeared to be a gun , and a subsequent inquiry determined the gun was fake , @entity43 said			2
still , school administrators spoke with the parents of the student , who was n't disciplined , the superintendent said			1
" we had to educate the student on the dangers " of posting such photos , @entity43 said			2
" he was a good kid			0
... it had a good ending			0
" in fact , no student has yet to be disciplined under the monitoring , but it 's not out of the question if analysts find a message warranting action , such as a threat of a campus shooting , @entity43 said this week			2
" i can see turning it over to police			0
that would be a situation in which discipline would follow , " he said			2
@entity39 's firm scours the social media postings of @entity11 students aged 13 and older -- the age at which parental permission is n't required for the school 's contracted monitoring -- and sends a daily report to principals on which students ' comments could be causes for concern , @entity39 said			1
the company wo n't disclose its methods and practices in gathering the students ' messages , but it does use key words in its searches			2
the firm also did n't disclose how it confirms the youths are indeed students of the district			1
to do the work , @entity39 employs no more than 10 full - time staffers -- as well as " a larger portion " of contract workers across the globe who labor a maximum of four hours a day because " the content they read is so dark and heavy , " @entity39 said			0
" it 's mostly kids hanging onto a thread of life , " @entity39 said , " and they 're posting to people also hanging on to a thread			2
" he declined to disclose how many school campuses have retained his firm , founded this past january in @entity136 , @entity12			1
@entity39 has been providing technology services to school districts the past 10 years			2
@entity28 also monitors whether students are talking about drug use , cutting class or violence			1
the firm even ascertains whether pupils are using their smartphone during class time , @entity39 said			2
@entity148 university suspends fraternity over @entity17 posts while critics say the @entity11 schools ' contract is an invasion of privacy , @entity39 said his firm helps schools bridge a digital - age communications " chasm			1
" " parents and school district personnel -- they are not able to effectively listen to the conversation where it 's happening now , " @entity39 said			2
" the notion about talking in class is about as old - fashioned as a @entity165 , no offense to the makers of the car			0
" when was the last time you sent a kid to the principal 's office for talking in class too much ? i just do n't think it happens too much			0
so what we kept seeing is the chasm keeps building between how students communicate and the ability to tell adults about what 's going on in their lives , " he said			2
" i thought we could bridge that gap			0
" some experts in digital media and privacy , however , take exception			0
" this is the government essentially hiring a contractor to stalk the social media of the kids , " said @entity189 , senior staff attorney for the @entity190 , a nonprofit that defends privacy , free speech and consumer rights			1
" when the government -- and public schools are part of the government -- engages in any kind of line - crossing and to actually go and gather information about people away from school , that crosses a line , " @entity189 said			1
he disagreed with school officials who say they are monitoring only public postings			1
" people say that 's not private : it 's public on @entity17			0
i say that 's just semantics			0
the question is what is the school doing ? it 's not stumbling into students -- like a teacher running across a student on the street			1
this is the school sending someone to watch them , " @entity189 said			0
@entity225 , president of the school district 's @entity226 , said parents have many questions about the monitoring , a topic that will be addressed later this month when the superintendent makes his regular appearance at a @entity226 meeting			1
parents want to know how and why this is being done , @entity225 said			0
" if it supports a child in a difficult situation -- whether it 's bullying or stress level -- and if it helps , any parent would be thrilled to have the help			0
but how is that happening ? " @entity225 said			0
" when you find something you 're concerned about , what are you doing ? do you approach the child , with or without the parents ? what does this mean ? when people do n't have information , they make up scenarios , " @entity225 said			0
" some of the concerns i 've heard is when kids say something nasty about a teacher , will they get in trouble ? i understand that 's not even remotely possible			0
" superintendent @entity43 said students wo n't be disciplined for commonplace criticism			1
" as far as anything said about teachers , as long as it 's appropriate , it will be ignored , " he said			0
@entity39 's firm does n't hack into private postings by students , nor their e-mail or text messages			1
" i find it interesting that people keep asking if we 're doing something illegal or snooping or eavesdropping , but what we 're actually doing is looking at public posts , " @entity39 said			1
" we do n't see any private posts			0
" high school learns to love students ' tech habits students can adjust their privacy settings if they do n't want the world to see their tweets or @entity17 updates			1
@entity39 's analysts stay abreast of the symbols , phonetic spellings , abbreviations , initials and other code - speak that youths type on social media			1
hate , for example , could be spelled " h8 , " and teens may refer to drugs with such words as " red , " " rolling , " and " blunt , " @entity39 said			0
in another example , @entity39 's firm learned how youths use drugs such as liquid hashish through vaporizers , or " vapes , " which are devices like electronic cigarettes that allow for inhalation without creating smoke , @entity39 said			0
teachers may not be aware that students are dipping their mouths into their jacket in order to take a hit off their " vapor pen , " @entity39 said			0
@entity39 's team will be able to spot whether the student or a classmate posts a public message about that activity -- with a message stating , for example , " ca n't believe a kid is getting high in geography right now , sucking on their vape , " @entity39 said			1
what school officials do with the daily findings of @entity28 is up the district , @entity39 said			1
" this is n't about our company questioning parents , " he said			0
" we fully respect the challenges of being parents			0
" we enforce the code of student conduct for every school we serve " by compiling a day - by - day report , he said			2
" it 's up to the district to handle it			0
" his firm is about to expand schools ' monitoring capacity with a new smartphone app that allows students and parents to anonymously report to and correspond with school officials about conduct violations			1
" honestly , we 're not spying on kids			0
can we focus back on the problem : the problem is we 're not listening effectively , " @entity39 said			0
" and we 're shifting that			0
