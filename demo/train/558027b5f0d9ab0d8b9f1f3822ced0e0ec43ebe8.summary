-- when justice @entity3 delivered her oath last summer , many women -- and especially @entity2 -- felt renewed hope as a champion of women 's rights took her place on the @entity10 @entity9			1
with democrats in the @entity13 and both houses of @entity15 , we believed that we could stop playing defense and actually advance women 's rights , including access to abortion			2
however , the health care debate quickly convinced us that we had to mobilize			1
first , rep. @entity21 , @entity22 , crafted the @entity24 amendment , designed to restrict women 's access to abortion coverage in the proposed public health insurance marketplace			1
millions of women who have access to abortion coverage through their insurance plans would lose this coverage if the insurance plans were offered in the exchange			1
we were told that women could use their own money to buy an abortion rider in advance : women would have to plan for an unplanned pregnancy			2
an abortion can range in cost from several hundred dollars to thousands of dollars for a " threatened " pregnancy			0
house speaker @entity46 allowed the amendment to move forward in the @entity13 health care bill out of fear that opponents would use abortion politics to tank health care reform			1
within weeks , sen. @entity53 , @entity54 , offered a near - exact model of the @entity21 bill in the @entity57			0
after the push for the @entity21 amendment , characterized by backroom dealings among elected officials and reported pressure from the @entity64 of @entity65 , it appeared that senators might go along			0
hundreds of @entity2 and women of all backgrounds descended on @entity69 to let legislators know that they can not play politics with our reproductive health care and to advocate for abortion care coverage as a part of health care reform			1
for now , senators are standing up to those who would sink reform with abortion politics , voting to table the @entity53 amendment , effectively killing it			0
but we know that these victories are often tenuous and that the growing @entity86 voice in favor of reproductive health care must stay strong			1
over the past few weeks , i 've heard from many latinas and their families , outraged that these amendments would make a legal medical procedure financially inaccessible for many women			2
they called their senators and wrote letters on behalf of daughters , sisters , aunts and mothers in their communities , urging policymakers to vote for reform that includes coverage for abortion -- and also provides health care access for immigrants			1
they organized because they know what is at stake			0
the amendments claim to " simply codify " the @entity114 amendment , an existing federal policy that prohibits federal government money from being used to fund abortions through @entity118			0
but in reality , both amendments would create a two - tier health care system			2
after 30 - plus years of the @entity114 amendment , a @entity123 report released this year indicates that among @entity118 - eligible women -- that is , low income -- who would have an abortion if it were paid for by the government , one in four instead continue the pregnancy to term in the absence of funding			2
this is because politicians prevent federal tax dollars from covering the procedure			0
moreover , the proposed @entity13 and @entity57 bills both maintain the five - year ban on legal permanent residents accessing publicly funded benefits , including @entity118 , leaving millions of legal residents without coverage for basic medical needs			0
according to a report by the @entity146 , 38 percent of @entity2 are uninsured , compared with 14.7 percent @entity148 white women , and more than half of all immigrants are women			2
the @entity152 predicts that by 2050 , one in four @entity10 will be @entity86			0
as @entity2 , we will be disproportionately affected if we do not have a health care package that includes access to the full range of reproductive health services			1
opponents argue that more women will be covered under overall health care reform , as if that should satisfy us			1
the fact remains : if millions of low - and moderate - income women covered under a new federally subsidized health system ca n't access abortion care from an insurance plan bought even partly with federal support , policymakers are essentially telling them that they do not matter -- that the reality of their lives must be ignored			1
the legacy of health care reform should not be to send women back into the shadows			1
we have worked too hard to reform our health care system for women to be worse off than they were before			1
there is no denying that people around the country , including many @entity2 , have complex feelings about abortion			2
many have conflicting feelings because of their religious faith -- @entity2 are overwhelmingly @entity187			0
but my work with @entity2 during these debates reminds me that for many women confronted by the decision to terminate a pregnancy , abortion is not a political issue ; it 's a personal health care issue between a woman , her family and her doctor			1
we have an opportunity to make history in these next few weeks and months			0
health care is not a luxury ; it is fundamental to a healthier and stronger nation			2
i urge policymakers to respect women who are trying to plan their pregnancies , take control of their futures and improve the lives of their families			0
we demand reproductive justice for women			0
anything less would be un-american			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			0

@entity218 : many @entity2 outraged over moves they say will restrict abortion coverage
@entity218 : latina support for reproductive rights must stay strong in health care debate
she says millions of women who have abortion coverage in insurance plans could lose it
@entity218 says abortion is personal issue between a woman , her family and doctor
