-- pope @entity1 marked his first good friday as the head of the @entity4 , asking the faithful to follow @entity7 ' lead			1
" @entity12 must respond to evil with good , taking the cross upon themselves as @entity7 did , " @entity1 said at a nighttime ceremony marking the @entity9 , also known as @entity9 or @entity9 , at @entity11 's @entity10			1
@entity1 said the cross represents @entity16 's response to evil in the world and that the answer to evil " is the cross of @entity7 -- a word which is love , mercy , forgiveness			1
" @entity24 , one of the holiest days on the @entity27 calendar , recalls the day @entity7 died on the cross			0
@entity1 , now @entity1 , was elected pontiff just over two weeks ago , succeeding @entity29			2
a former @entity31 cardinal , he became the first @entity33 pope of the modern era , the first from @entity36 , the first @entity37 and the first to assume the name @entity1			2
since taking on the role , he has focused on a message of helping the poor and needy and demonstrated a simple , humble personal style			0
@entity1 already has repeatedly veered from tradition -- from the white papal robes he wore on the @entity46 balcony the night of his election , to his choosing to ask for the crowd to pray for him first before he offered a blessing of his own			1
@entity1 's journey to top of the church his selection came shortly before @entity54 , one of the most significant periods of the @entity4 year			1
these celebrations will culminate on @entity58 with the pope 's first " @entity63 " blessing , directed to the city of @entity11 and to the world			1
celebrant references @entity66 story these remarks at one of the @entity71 capital 's most famous landmarks came hours after the new pontiff , dressed in red vestments , began a service at the @entity46 's @entity75 by walking down its nave and laying on his stomach in prayer , according to @entity80			1
he then joined legions of @entity4 worldwide who reflected friday on the gospel account of the @entity84 , recalling the day @entity7 died on the cross before rising three days later , according to @entity27 doctrine			2
per tradition , the @entity46 sermon was given by the preacher to the papal household , the rev. @entity91			2
" we have the opportunity to make , on this day , the most important decision of our lives , one that opens wide before us the doors of eternity , " @entity91 said			0
" to believe ! " opinion : pope @entity1 ' gestures strike fire in our hearts during the address , he referenced author @entity66 's " an @entity105 , " a story in which a king on his deathbed whispers a message to a subject , makes the subject repeat it , and then sends him on his way			1
the messenger tries to leave but encounters insurmountable obstacles as he attempts to head away			0
@entity91 said the story is a " powerful religious symbol and takes on a new meaning , almost prophetic , when heard on @entity24			0
" " we must do everything possible so that the @entity4 may never look like that complicated and cluttered castle described by @entity66 , and the message may come out of it as free and joyous as when the messenger began his run , " he said			0
" we know what the impediments are that can restrain the messenger : dividing walls , starting with those that separate the various @entity27 churches from one another , the excess of bureaucracy , the residue of past ceremonials , laws and disputes , now only debris			0
" the @entity9 dressed all in white , the pope arrived shortly after 9 p.m. ( 4 p.m. et ) at the @entity10 to mark the @entity9			1
as a large crowd -- many of them holding lit candles -- looked on , @entity1 sat solemnly as a cross was walked around the historic @entity146 amphitheater to recall 14 moments from @entity7 ' final day			2
participants included clergymen and other christians from @entity151 to @entity152 to @entity153 to the @entity154			0
at one point , the cross was carried by a woman in a wheelchair , from a group representing the physically and mentally disabled			0
@entity1 spoke to close the ceremony , explaining the meaning of the cross and how @entity12 could apply that in their lives			1
" let us walk together in our @entity9 , and let us do so carrying in our hearts these words of love and forgiveness , " he said			1
similar services and ceremonies were held in churches and other locales worldwide , including the annual @entity9 walk through the winding streets of @entity174 's old city			2
pope @entity1 ' humble superiority they came a day after @entity1 broke with tradition by going to a youth detention center in @entity11 , rather than the city 's chief cathedral , where he washed the feet of a dozen young detainees			1
among the group at the @entity184 were two women and two @entity186			0
the pontiff poured water over the young offenders ' feet , wiped them with a white towel and kissed them			0
in his homily , given to about 50 young offenders , he said that everyone should help one another			0
" as a priest and as a bishop , i should be at your service			0
it is a duty that comes from my heart , " he said			0
the act of foot - washing at the @entity204 on @entity205 is part of the @entity27 tradition that mirrors @entity7 ' washing of his disciples ' feet			0
the girls whose feet @entity1 washed -- in another move away from custom -- were an @entity71 and an @entity214 , according to the @entity46			1
the @entity215 responded friday to " questions and concerns " related to the pope 's washing the young offenders ' feet , especially those of two females , calling it a " simple and spontaneous gesture of love , affection , forgiveness and mercy			1
" " when @entity7 washed the feet of those who were with him on the first @entity205 , he desired to teach all a lesson about the meaning of service , using a gesture that included all members of the community , " the office said in a statement			0
" ... to have excluded the young women from the ritual washing of feet ... would have detracted our attention from the essence of the @entity205 gospel , and the very beautiful and simple gesture of a father who desired to embrace those who were on the fringes of society			2
" why is the pope washing prisoners ' feet ? @entity0 's @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			1
