-- the @entity2 regime has carried out a " systematic " series of abuses against protesters that could " qualify as crimes against humanity , " and the @entity9 must hold the government accountable , a leading humanitarian watchdog organization said wednesday			0
@entity12 makes these assertions in a report titled " ' we 've never seen such horror ' : @entity17 in @entity18			1
" the 57 - page document contains chilling detail from dozens of victims and witnesses to abuses in @entity18 province , the southwestern @entity2 powder keg where the anti-government protest movement began in mid-march before spreading across the country			1
the government reacted with a tough crackdown against protesters			0
at present , the report says , there have been about 887 deaths " across @entity2 , " including at least 418 people in @entity18 province			1
" for more than two months now , @entity2 security forces have been killing and torturing their own people with complete impunity , " said @entity36 , @entity37 director at @entity12			1
" they need to stop -- and if they do n't , it is the @entity44 's responsibility to make sure that the people responsible face justice			0
" @entity12 said the @entity2 government should take " immediate steps to halt the excessive use of lethal force by security forces " and that the @entity44 " should impose sanctions and press @entity2 for accountability			1
" if the government " does n't respond adequately , " the council should refer @entity2 to the @entity56 , the group said			2
one major diplomat on wednesday echoed the international outrage over @entity2 's crackdown and raised the issue of @entity56 involvement			1
@entity65 foreign minister @entity64 , speaking to the @entity62 in @entity63 , said it is " high time the @entity44 " considered a formal referral of president @entity69 to the @entity56			2
there was no immediate @entity2 government reaction to the report , which " is based on more than 50 interviews with residents of @entity18 and several @entity76 nationals who were in @entity18 during the protests			1
" @entity12 said it has also " reviewed dozens of videos , filmed by the witnesses , which corroborate their accounts			2
" the report notes that the demonstrations began in @entity18 city with the " detention and torture of 15 young boys accused of painting graffiti slogans calling for the downfall of the regime " and that the release of the " bruised and bloodied " boys " fanned the flames of popular anger			1
" " on march 18 , following friday prayer , several thousand protesters marched from @entity95 in @entity18 calling for the release of the children and greater political freedom , and accusing government officials of corruption			2
security forces initially used water cannons and teargas against the protesters and then opened live fire , killing at least four , " the report says			0
the protests then snowballed outside @entity18			2
activists have blamed @entity2 security forces for the deadly crackdown but @entity2 has blamed the violence on " terrorist groups , " " armed gangs , " and " foreign elements			0
" @entity12 said witnesses from @entity18 " provided consistent accounts of security forces using lethal force against peaceful protesters			1
" " in some cases , security forces first used tear gas or fired in the air , but when protesters refused to disperse , they fired live ammunition from automatic weapons into the crowds			0
in most cases , especially as demonstrations in @entity18 grew bigger , security forces opened fire without giving advance warning or making any effort to disperse the protesters by nonlethal means			2
" security forces deliberately targeted protesters , who were , in the vast majority of cases , unarmed and posed no threat to the forces ; rescuers who were trying to take the wounded and the dead away ; medical personnel trying to reach the wounded			0
" the report says witnesses regularly noted " the presence of snipers on government buildings near the protests " and " other evidence obtained by @entity12 also suggests that security forces participating in the operations against the protesters ( in @entity18 and other cities ) had received , at least in a number of cases , ' shoot - to - kill ' orders from their commanders			1
" several elite army units and branches of the intelligence services were part of the crackdown			0
" on several occasions army units deployed to quell the protests seemed reluctant to shoot at protesters , allowed them to pass through checkpoints , and , in at least two cases documented by @entity12 , refused orders to shoot and either surrendered to the protesters or handed over their weapons to the protesters , " the report says			1
many arrests " seemed entirely arbitrary with no formal charges ever brought against the detainees " and witnesses described the detention conditions as appalling			0
" released detainees interviewed by @entity12 said that they , as well as hundreds of others they saw in detention , were subjected to various forms of torture and degrading treatment , " the report says			1
" the methods of torture included prolonged beatings with sticks , twisted wires , and other devices ; electric shocks administered with @entity192 and electric batons ; use of improvised metal and wooden ' racks ' ; and , in at least one case documented by @entity12 , the rape of a male detainee with a baton			2
" interrogators and guards also subjected detainees to various forms of humiliating treatment , such as urinating on the detainees , stepping on their faces , and making them kiss the officers ' shoes			0
several detainees said they were repeatedly threatened with imminent execution			0
" the majority of witnesses interviewed by @entity12 also referred to the existence of mass graves in @entity18			1
there was a punishing @entity2 security siege that lasted at least 11 days from april 25 and extended to neighboring towns			0
" witnesses said that @entity18 residents experienced acute shortages of food , water ( because security forces shot and damaged water tanks ) , medicine , and other necessary supplies during the siege			0
electricity and all communications were cut off for at least 15 days , and , at the time of this writing , remained cut off in several neighborhoods in the city , " the report says			0
authorities put an information blockade into effect on @entity18 " to ensure that abuses were not exposed " and cell phones with damning videos were regularly confiscated during searches , it says			0
" no independent observers could enter the city and one international journalist who managed to report from @entity18 during the first two weeks of protests in march was arrested upon his return to @entity248			1
" from april 25 to around may 22 , @entity18 residents were not permitted to " pray in mosques and all calls for prayer were banned , " the report says			1
" security forces occupied all of the mosques in the city and , according to witnesses who saw the mosques after they reopened , desecrated them by writing graffiti on the walls			0
