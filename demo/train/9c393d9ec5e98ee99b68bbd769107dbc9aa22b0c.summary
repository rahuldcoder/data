-- though @entity1 has received lots of attention for getting healthy since his 2004 heart surgery -- losing weight , exercising more , improving his diet -- associates of the former president thursday stressed that @entity1 continues to live at a breakneck pace and raised questions about the extent of his lifestyle changes			1
" while he eats a lot better than he used to , " one friend tells @entity0 , " he certainly indulges every once in a while consistent with past behavior -- [ for example ] fries with his fish			1
" " he still works long days and stays up very , very late , " the friend said			1
" he has gone from a frenetic pace to what most people would consider a frenetic pace			1
he 's approaching @entity25 , and he 's living a life not that different from his 30s			1
" after undergoing quadruple bypass operation on four blocked arteries in 2004 , word spread that @entity1 had reformed the lifestyle that was immortalized in " @entity31 " skits about the then - president jogging to @entity34 's			2
when @entity1 left the @entity36 , his cholesterol level was 233 , well above the recommended upper threshold of 200			2
and his so - called bad cholesterol jumped 40 points during his final year in office , to around 177 -- about 50 points above normal			2
after his surgery , @entity1 stepped up his advocacy for fighting obesity			2
in 2005 , he announced he was partnering with the @entity45 to fight rising childhood obesity rates			2
the following year , he appeared before the @entity47 to urge state executives to fight rising obesity rates , mentioning his @entity34 's habit and wishing out loud for the fast - food chain 's french fries to be cooked in olive oil			2
even while crusading against obesity and appearing trimmer than in his @entity36 days , however , @entity1 has shied away from discussing lifestyle reforms since his surgery			1
" i ate a lot of stuff that was high in fat			1
... i ate a lot of it , " the former president told @entity0 's chief medical correspondent , dr. @entity61 , as he described his life before surgery in a 2005 interview			1
" and you know , i just did n't think about it			2
and i did n't have regular exercise			0
" but @entity1 has avoided giving details about his post-surgery diet and exercise routine			0
friends say @entity1 introduced healthier foods to his diet but has n't written off fries and steaks entirely			0
and they stressed that his schedule is as nonstop as ever , with the president frequently skipping sleep until his next plane trip			0
" [ the ] whole time i have known him -- goes back 20 years -- he 's led a hectic life , " said former @entity1 adviser and @entity0 analyst @entity82			1
" [ there ] ought to be two @entity88 in order to keep up the pace he does			1
i think it has been especially relentless in the last few months			0
" @entity1 's role as the @entity95 special envoy for @entity96 has taken him twice to the earthquake - ravaged nation and he is leading efforts to raise money for the hard - hit area			0
@entity102 , a counselor to the former president , said thursday -- citing the former president 's doctors -- that the symptoms that provoked @entity1 's hospitalization were n't related to work , diet or cholesterol			0
while keeping mostly mum on lifestyle changes , @entity1 has opened up about his lifelong struggle with weight since undergoing surgery			0
in announcing the @entity45 partnership in 2005 , for instance , @entity1 disclosed that he weighed 210 pounds by the time he was 15			0
" i was probably in the last generation of @entity119 where people widely thought a fat baby was a healthy baby , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity61			1
" i always battled my weight , all of the way through school			0
" in a series of 2007 ads for @entity128 's presidential campaign , @entity1 poked fun at his weight struggles			0
one spot showed the former president daydreaming about a cheese burger while running on a treadmill			0
" exercising is hard , " a voice in the ad said , comparing it to the ease of attending an @entity140 caucus			0
@entity0 's @entity142 and @entity143 contributed to this report .			1

" he still works long days and stays up very , very late , " the friend said
" while he eats a lot better than he used to , " he still indulges , one friend tells @entity0
" ought to be two @entity88 in order to keep up the pace he does , " says @entity82
