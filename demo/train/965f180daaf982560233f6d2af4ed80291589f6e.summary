-- in the @entity3 militia strongholds in southern @entity4 and south @entity5 , they set off fireworks and fired guns in the air			1
in the northern @entity11 city of @entity12 , people waved @entity14 and @entity15 flags			1
but when @entity22 's vice president read president @entity24 's resignation statement friday , patrons watching tv in @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , suddenly turned quiet			1
the cafe 's @entity14 manager " clearly is not happy about the news , " said @entity27			1
" just last night , the man spoke to me at length about @entity22 and why @entity24 needed to stay until september			0
when i asked him how he felt about the @entity24 news , my new friend suddenly told me he can not speak @entity33 and that i should use my computer to find @entity33 news			0
" such was the disparity of opinions that could be heard in the @entity38 about the events unfolding in @entity22 on friday			1
so , too , were the responses from world leaders and political organizations -- some of whom ascribed starkly different reasons for the historic significance of the moment			0
to @entity50 prime minister @entity49 , @entity24 's departure was an important first step for a nation yearning for democracy			1
" today has been a remarkable day , " @entity49 said , " particularly for those people in @entity55 and elsewhere , who have spoken out so bravely and so peacefully for change in their country			0
" @entity59 president @entity58 hailed @entity22 's " historic moment " and paid tribute to @entity24 's decision to resign			1
he called for steps leading to free elections and reforms and urged @entity14 " to continue their non-violent march to freedom			1
" for the government of @entity71 , @entity22 's political earthquake meant something entirely different			2
" a new @entity38 is taking shape , not the @entity38 the @entity79 had planned for but one which has been created based on @entity76 awakening , " said @entity74 spokesman @entity73 in an interview with state - run @entity76			1
@entity71 's semi-official @entity82 news agency called it " joyful coincidence " that @entity22 's revolution culminated on the 32nd anniversary of @entity71 's @entity76 revolution victory			1
elsewhere in the region , political groups , some of which are hostile to @entity11 and the @entity79 , were quick to attach the success of the @entity14 revolt to their own aspirations			1
@entity94 , a spokesman for @entity96 's biggest opposition coalition , the @entity95 , said " the map of the @entity99 nations will change as a result of the revolution			1
" " @entity24 's fall , " @entity94 said , " proves that oppression and use of force can not add life to the current regimes , and time for change has come			2
" the @entity95 is primarily a coalition of @entity109 and @entity110			0
@entity112 spokesman @entity111 called @entity24 's ouster " a victory for the @entity15 people			2
" @entity112 , said @entity111 , " calls on the new @entity14 leadership to lift the siege of @entity118 and to open the @entity120 crossing and assure the free movement between @entity22 and @entity122 and to start the development construction process of @entity118			1
" @entity111 's remarks reflected the sentiments of @entity15 in @entity112 - controlled @entity118 and the @entity126			1
in @entity118 , revelers spilled into the streets , honked car horns and fired guns in celebration			1
@entity11 's two major tv channels carried the announcement of @entity24 's departure live , with images from @entity136 's @entity55 supplemented by their political and @entity99 affairs commentators debating what the development means for @entity11			2
the headline on the website of @entity11 's largest newspaper , @entity143 , read , " @entity144 -- masses elated			2
" the @entity11 government said little about the fall of @entity24			0
the @entity148 in @entity149 issued a statement expressing concern about how the political transformation of @entity22 will affect @entity11 and " what role the @entity153 will play in the transition and beyond			0
" in @entity5 , public reaction appeared muted			0
diners in small cafes watched @entity99 satellite coverage of the @entity14 street celebrations			1
for some , it brought back nostalgic memories of the 2005 uprising that kicked the @entity164 out of @entity5			0
however , a @entity3 spokesman told @entity0 , " this is the true path when the people believe in their resolve " and it makes all their sacrifices worthwhile			0
" the spokesman applauded the " the steadfastness and unity of the @entity14 people , young and old , men and women , which showed that blood was stronger than the sword			1
" @entity24 frequently accused @entity3 cells of infiltrating @entity22 at the behest of @entity71			0
@entity182 leaders have expressed concerns that a @entity22 could become another @entity71			0
@entity22 's @entity182 neighbors fear their governments could suffer similar fates if popular uprisings spread to their countries			2
few , if any , representatives of those governments publicly uttered such fears on friday			0
@entity20 foreign minister @entity192 called @entity22 " a pillar in the region " and sent along " wishes for stability , security and prosperity			2
" a statement from the @entity200 said its government " is always keen to foster brotherly , distinguished historic ties with @entity22 in a way that serves the interests of the two brotherly countries and their peoples			0
" @entity208 prime minister @entity207 released a statement expressing his government 's " hope for a peaceful transition to a participatory and pluralistic order in full respect for human rights			1
" @entity207 called on @entity14 military officials to exercise " common sense and restraint " in the transfer of power to a new democratically - elected government			1
so did officials representing @entity182 governments			0
in the @entity225 , senate majority leader @entity224 said " it is crucial that @entity24 's departure be an orderly one and that it leads to true democracy for @entity22 , including free , fair and open elections			2
" " we caution all sides against violence during this transition , and we will be watching the situation closely , " @entity224 said			0
@entity237 prime minister @entity236 called for an @entity14 government " that will continue to respect peace treaties and seek peace in the @entity38			1
" @entity49 and @entity243 chancellor @entity242 , among others , said their governments were ready to help @entity22 make the transition to a democratic society			0
@entity242 said her country would " support as much as we can the justified requests of the people in @entity22			0
" @entity252 's government wo n't be joining @entity243			2
