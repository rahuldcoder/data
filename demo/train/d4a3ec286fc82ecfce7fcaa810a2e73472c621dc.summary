editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published this fall by @entity10			0
@entity2 writes widely about current events			2
@entity14 says interest groups have eroded the quality of @entity18 's democratic process			1
@entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity21 ) -- last week , @entity18 saw some disturbing images			2
during town hall meetings about health care reform , legislators and citizens were loudly interrupted and intimidated by members of the audience who refused to let them speak			1
we do n't yet have solid evidence as to whether the protesters were local citizens simply expressing their genuine concerns about the cost of the health care proposals -- concerns that have been showing up in recent polls -- or whether they were people primarily recruited and sent into these meetings by such groups as @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43			2
at the same time , we did learn last week that a firm hired by the coal industry sent fake letters to members of @entity48 , allegedly from @entity49 and @entity51 - @entity18 organizations , opposing climate and energy legislation			1
the letters were sent on behalf of an industry group , the @entity54 , by a subcontractor , @entity56 , a firm that manages grassroots campaigns on behalf of interest groups			1
the coal industry said it was outraged to learn of the fake letters , and @entity61 blamed them on a temporary employee who it said has been fired			0
the incident brought to mind " @entity69 " campaigns , which are sophisticated lobbying operations that give the impression of an actual grassroots mobilization			0
while advocacy organizations have long worked on letter - writing campaigns to members of @entity48 -- where citizens are asked to sign and send letters in support of or against legislation -- the coal scandal provides evidence of a practice of claiming support without any consent			2
these events bring back memories of a movie that came out a little over 10 years ago called " @entity84			0
" in that film , @entity85 played @entity88 sen. @entity87 , a politician who came out of the liberal politics of the 1960s but had become disillusioned by the corrupting life of @entity91			0
he is so distraught that he hires a hit man to kill him after taking out a multimillion - dollar life insurance policy			2
yet after meeting an enchanting young woman , played by @entity95 , @entity87 is re-energized			0
while trying to avoid the assassin whom he hired , @entity87 spends the weekend railing against the power of lobbyists and interest groups in the political process , explaining to citizens in one inner - city neighborhood that politicians will never pay attention to them because they do n't contribute enough money			1
though he is excited about life once again , the film ends with a lobbyist shooting the senator because he is frightened by the threat he presents			0
the film is obviously a gross exaggeration of what lobbyists will do to protect their interests			0
nor should we vilify interest groups , which have always been part of our democracy			1
the truth is that there are many kinds of interest groups , dealing with all sorts of issues and reflecting all sorts of political perspectives			1
but interest groups have clearly eroded the quality of our democratic process			1
the most obvious way has been through outright corruption			0
there are many historical examples of how powerful interest groups tried to buy their way to success			1
@entity18 politics was rocked in 1905 and 1906 by revelations that the life insurance industry had bribed politicians			2
during the congressional hearings over @entity146 in 1973 , the investigation revealed that the milk industry had donated money to president @entity150 's administration and powerful members of @entity48 in exchange for favorable decisions by the @entity154			0
lobbyists and politicians on the left and right have been guilty of these sins			0
the recent corruption scandal that has shaken @entity20 is a painful reminder of this dark side of our political system			0
interest groups have also eroded the quality of our political system even when they are not engaged in corruption			1
since the 1970s , there has been a massive proliferation of interest groups in @entity91 the level of campaign contributions from these sources has steadily increased as politicians scramble to find sufficient funds to meet the rising cost of campaigns			1
the campaign finance system gives interest groups better access to elected officials			1
now , interested parties are gradually extending their reach into areas far from @entity91			0
we have seen the use of these tactics several times in recent years			0
in 2005 and 2006 , for example , the nation learned how @entity193 's lobbying firm worked with @entity195 's conservative organizations to mount @entity69 protests against state efforts to legalize gambling because they threatened @entity200 groups that were clients of @entity193			1
if reports that advocacy groups have been behind the recent outbursts at town hall meetings are true , these revelations would signal a disturbing trend in interest group politics			1
some liberal supporters of health care reform are naturally talking about responding in kind , fighting fire with fire			0
while this might very well create a more level yelling field , such warfare will crowd out legitimate efforts by unaffiliated citizens to talk about , question and debate the legislation with their representatives			0
but the danger is lobby creep , as we have seen with the coal industry 's lobbying campaign			2
the concern is not primarily about rabble - rousers , who frequently emerge on the left and right at these events , employing disruptive tactics that we have seen since the 1960s			1
rather the concern has to do with @entity91 - based interest groups and lobbyists sending people to local meetings to convey a specific and choreographed message , while preventing debate among actual local citizens			1
it is easy to foresee how interest groups can take this even further , sending their employees to impersonate local citizens while preventing discussions			1
such tactics would dangerously threaten to close one of the few remaining doors in the democratic process to everyone other than those with the largest resources			0
it is not difficult to envision in the near future a surreal world of town hall meetings where legislators meet with a room filled with paid operatives from interest groups			1
these kinds of operations must stop			0
this is not an issue that can be solved through regulation , since our democracy must always protect and cherish the right to organize and mobilize politically			0
but citizens and politicians must not tolerate these kinds of activities from interest and advocacy groups -- even those that represent positions that they support			2
we need to save what little room is left for civic engagement in @entity18			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity14 .			0

@entity2 : interest groups are focus of *controversy* over disruptive town hall tactics
he says it 's not clear if the protests are largely being stage - managed
he says interest groups are playing a bigger role in @entity18 democracy
@entity2 : there 's a danger that interest groups will choke off real debate
