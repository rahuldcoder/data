-- there are few things more annoying than listening to ignorant , whiny parents complain about a school district teaching their children about sex			1
how in the world do we say it 's ok for schools to teach our children about math , science , history , and numerous other subjects , yet then get high and mighty with righteous indignation when biology is taken a step further to focus on sex ? too many parents live in denial about their children having sex , and somehow saying you 'll handle the tough stuff is living in fantasy land			2
the city of @entity28 should be commended for not bowing to the blowhards and confronting the reality of sex in @entity32 by mandating a sex education curriculum beginning in 2012			1
whether it 's safe sex practices or even abstinence , all of these issues must be dealt with in an educational setting , because when we look at the teen pregnancy rates , sexually transmitted diseases , including @entity42 , it only makes sense to have as much education as possible			1
taxes and death are considered two undeniably realities of life			0
i would say that sex is right behind those two			2
i recall as an elementary student , as well as in middle school and high school , taking classes that dealt with sex			1
it was done properly and smartly , and was needed			0
did it prevent children from getting pregnant too soon ? i ca n't say for sure			0
but i can definitely say knowing more about a topic than less is crucial			0
now let 's deal with the abstinence - only nuts who act as if anything else should n't be taught			2
yes , i 'm talking directly to @entity67			0
they are upset with videos demonstrating how to put on a condom , as well as other aspects of the sex education curriculum			1
folks , y'all are flat out crazy if you want to encourage parents to opt out of sex education by making it more about abstinence and nothing else			1
why ca n't both take place ? abstinence is definitely the safest of all safe sex measures , but there is also a point when we have to accept reality			1
talk to school teachers and administrators and they will tell you that students as young as middle school are engaging in oral sex , and there is the belief that that really does n't count as sex			2
yet anyone with half a brain knows that to be the case			0
if kids are out there having oral sex , they sure as heck need to know that doing so without protection can be life - altering			2
but such parents groups prefer to stick their heads in the sand			0
they find such talk unseemly and think such frankness should be left between child and parent			0
as a @entity118 lovin ' @entity117 , i 'm about real talk , and if that means dealing with sex directly , let 's go for it			0
educators and city officials in @entity28 should fully brace themselves for the onslaught			1
right - thinking folks are tired of seeing young folks coming back @entity42 - positive or dealing with a pregnancy at 16			0
i have nine nieces and four nephews , and i would be fully supportive of them being taught about sex education in school			1
forget shying from a tough subject			0
if we are going to equip our children for tomorrow , then sex needs to be dealt with in a smart , productive and educational setting by professionals			1
it 's clear that parents are n't as dependable on some matters as they like to delude themselves into believing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			1
