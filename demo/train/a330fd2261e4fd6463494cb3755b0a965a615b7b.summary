who needs scripted dialogue when women are willing to physically and emotionally exchange blows for the camera ? @entity13 's " @entity12 , " the mega-hit known for both male and female brawls , featured yet another bar fight on thursday night 's episode			1
despite hyping the altercation between cast member @entity18 and a female club - goer in a promo for the show , the scene was treated like any other segment			1
catfights have become practically de rigueur for many cable and network reality series			1
shows like " @entity27 , " " @entity28 , " " @entity29 " and " @entity30 " all seemingly rely on female cast members ' aggressive behavior for ratings			1
the genre has become more about shock tv than reality tv , said @entity37 , who runs the spoiler site @entity39			1
that said , " if you 're shocked by what you see ( on reality tv ) , you should n't be , " he said			1
for almost a decade , viewers have watched 25 to 30 women vie for the attention of one man each season on @entity51 's " the bachelor			1
" and if the majority of catfights on reality tv have taught us anything , it 's that viewers love watching women fight over a man			1
so what 's shocking about the current season 's villain , @entity62 , who said she 'd like to " verbally assault " and " rip another girl 's head off " ? @entity37 rhetorically asked			1
" people , two years ago , were saying the exact same thing about @entity69			0
" @entity70 , who contributes to the reality tv site @entity72 , said viewers are still shocked by cattiness and girl - on - girl violence despite no longer being appalled by it			1
" viewers almost revel in it ... in an excited way , " she said , adding that stories about catfights on reality shows elicit the most comments on @entity72			1
judging by the comments , people seem to be annoyed by the constant cattiness on such shows , @entity70 said , adding , " maybe people like the cringe factor			0
" and so producers routinely cast women who will be controversial			0
as @entity101 , the executive producer and star of @entity104 's " @entity103 , " wrote in a commentary for @entity0 in july , " i 'm not a big supporter of the bickering , drink throwing and fighting , but when you put a group of strong , independent and vocal women who are going through or just came out of a bad relationship together , there 's bound to be a little drama			2
" " more and more people are starting to realize how scripted some of this stuff is , " @entity37 said			0
" not in terms of words , but in unscripted drama			0
they 're not telling people what to say , but they 're giving them a situation where they know what 's going to arise			2
" that 's exactly what happened when @entity104 's other reality hit " @entity30 " found @entity121 and @entity122 in the same room			1
what began as a verbal disagreement ended with flying fists and exposed lady parts			0
" viewers like to find a character to dislike , " @entity70 said			0
" people like to have sides			0
like with ' @entity132 ' -- @entity135 ( @entity134 ) vs. @entity133 ( @entity136 )			0
" who could forget @entity141 's infamous " last supper , " in which she flipped a table over			2
" there 's over 100 ( reality shows ) with all of the cable programs , " @entity37 said			1
" you almost have to outdo the others to get noticed			0
" the aggression appears to have amped up recently			0
a study out of @entity150 published in 2010 stated that " reality - television programs contained high levels of verbal and relational aggression , but almost no physical violence			2
such ' meanness ' is so frequent , that it is almost expected in reality programs			2
" and shows like @entity159 's " @entity158 " are built around mean girls and fights			2
these shows clearly have an audience			0
however , @entity37 said , that does n't mean viewers are desensitized to girl - on - girl violence			0
if they were , he said , producers would move on to a new attention - grabbing storyline			0
which raises a frightening question : what does a show have to do for us to say , " oh , we 've never seen this on reality tv before " ?			2
