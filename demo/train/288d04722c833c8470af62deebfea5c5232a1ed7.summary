we take a lot for granted about the way the world looks today -- the widespread freedom , the unprecedented global prosperity , and the absence of war among great powers			1
in 1941 there were only a dozen democracies in the world			1
today there are more than 100			0
for four centuries prior to 1950 , global gdp rose by less than 1 percent a year			0
since 1950 it has risen by an average of 4 percent a year , and billions of people have been lifted out of poverty			0
the first half of the 20th century saw the two most destructive wars in the history of mankind , and in prior centuries war among great powers was almost constant			1
but for the past 60 years no great powers have gone to war			1
this is the world @entity27 made when it assumed global leadership after @entity30 would this world order survive if @entity27 declined as a great power ? some @entity27 intellectuals insist that a " @entity35 " world need not look very different from the @entity27 world and that all we need to do is " manage " @entity27 decline			1
but that is wishful thinking			0
if the balance of power shifts in the direction of other powers , the world order will inevitably change to suit their interests and preferences			1
take the issue of democracy			2
for several decades , the balance of power in the world has favored democratic governments			2
in a genuinely post-american world , the balance would shift toward the great power autocracies			2
both @entity56 and @entity57 already protect dictators like @entity60 's @entity59			2
if they gain greater relative influence in the future , we will see fewer democratic transitions and more autocrats hanging on to power			2
what about the free market , free trade economic order ? people assume @entity56 and other rising powers that have benefited so much from the present system would have a stake in preserving it			0
they would n't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs			0
but @entity56 's form of capitalism is heavily dominated by the state , with the ultimate goal being preservation of the ruling party			2
although the @entity56 have been beneficiaries of an open international economic order , they could end up undermining it simply because , as an autocratic society , their priority is to preserve the state 's control of wealth and the power it brings			2
they might kill the goose because they ca n't figure out how to keep both it and themselves alive			0
finally , what about the long peace that has held among the great powers for the better part of six decades ? many people imagine that @entity27 predominance will be replaced by some kind of multipolar harmony			1
but multipolar systems have historically been neither stable nor peaceful			0
war among the great powers was a common , if not constant , occurrence in the long periods of multipolarity in the 16th , 17th , and 18th centuries			0
the 19th century was notable for two stretches of great - power peace of roughly four decades each , punctuated , however , by major wars among great powers and culminating in @entity119 , the most destructive and deadly war mankind had known up to that point			1
the era of @entity27 predominance has shown that there is no better recipe for great - power peace than certainty about who holds the upper hand			1
many people view the present international order as the inevitable result of human progress , a combination of advancing science and technology , an increasingly global economy , strengthening international institutions , evolving " norms " of international behavior , and the gradual but inevitable triumph of liberal democracy over other forms of government -- forces of change that transcend the actions of men and nations			0
but there was nothing inevitable about the world that was created after @entity30 international order is not an evolution ; it is an imposition			0
it is the domination of one vision over others -- in @entity27 's case , the domination of liberal free market principles of economics , democratic principles of politics , and a peaceful international system that supports these , over other visions that other nations and peoples may have			1
the present order will last only as long as those who favor it and benefit from it retain the will and capacity to defend it			0
if and when @entity27 power declines , the institutions and norms @entity27 power has supported will decline , too			1
or they may collapse altogether as we transition into another kind of world order , or into disorder			0
we may discover then that the @entity27 was essential to keeping the present world order together and that the alternative to @entity27 power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe -- which was what the world looked like right before the @entity27 order came into being .			1

@entity190 : we take for granted the relative peace , freedom and prosperity of the world
@entity27 's dominance as a superpower has *encouraged* democracy , prevented war , he says
@entity190 : an @entity27 decline could lead to a more *turbulent* and troubled world
