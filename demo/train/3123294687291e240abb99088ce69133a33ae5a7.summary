@entity0 , @entity1 -- the line - up at this year 's @entity4 is a cineaste 's dream			1
there are high expectations for @entity10 's " @entity9 , " a drama about 19th - century poet @entity12			1
packed with big name auteurs ( @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 among others ) and intriguing propositions , the competition for the coveted @entity14 is sure to be fierce			1
while there may be a dearth of surprises in the line - up , the world 's shiniest cinema event has certainly proved that in these tough economic times it can still cherry pick the best of what 's out there			1
but what among the dizzying array of celluloid magic has caught the eye of industry insiders and professionals ? the @entity40 asked a blogger , a critic and a film buyer attending the festival what films they will be watching out for at this year 's event			1
the critic name : @entity49 credentials : film critic for @entity53 newspaper @entity52 on sunday @entity4 experience : 17 years it 's heavily loaded with big names and the strange thing is that this year there are very few surprises in there			1
last year there was @entity64 @entity63 's " @entity62 " ( which won the @entity65 ) and @entity68 @entity67 's animation " @entity69 , " films that nobody knew anything about in competition			1
the one that people are either really looking forward to or dreading is " @entity79 , " @entity78 's new film			1
@entity78 gave everybody a rough time in 2002 with " @entity82 , " a violent , confrontational rape - revenge drama			2
the thing about him is once he 's got you in the cinema you 're not going to get out			2
this one has been made in @entity88 and is the story of someone looking at the events leading up to their own death			0
in particular , i 'll be looking at @entity10 's film , " @entity9 , " starring @entity95 and @entity96			1
it 's based on the three - year romance between 19th - century poet @entity12 and @entity100 , which was cut short by his death at the age of 25			1
she has n't delivered for quite a while			2
her last few films were at best patchy and at worst disappointing			2
she 's shown skill at her version of costume dramas in the past with films like " @entity112 , " which won the @entity14 in 1994			1
five - times @entity14 nominated @entity114 [ - born ] @entity115 's " @entity118 " is another film people are talking about			1
it is set in 1914 and is apparently about the emergence of @entity120			0
i imagine it will be fairly austere and confrontational			0
i also imagine it will be very good			2
he has never made a film that does n't really engage or impress on some level			2
there 's also @entity128 @entity4 stalwart @entity18 's film " @entity139 , " starring @entity130 and @entity131 about a grieving couple who retreat to a small cabin in the forest to mourn following the death of their child			1
there has been some controversy over why he is making what looks like a conventional @entity145 horror			0
it almost certainly wo n't be that			2
i suspect it will be philosophical			0
a lot of these filmmakers are not entertainers			0
they like to give their audiences a hard time			0
one of the keynotes of this year is going to be confrontation			0
the blogger name : @entity159 credentials : co-founder of @entity163 film blog and editor of @entity166 blog @entity4 experience : two years in the @entity170 section i 'm really excited about " @entity171 , " which is directed by these two young @entity174 brothers , @entity175 and @entity176			1
their style is reminiscent of the @entity179 -- but with this sense of humor and willingness to experiment in real locations , and use the people that are walking by as accidental characters			0
they 're sometimes lumped together with the young @entity174 " @entity189 " scene but their films are really different			0
they 've got a really interesting sense of style			0
another film i 'm really excited about is a documentary by @entity1 oscar - winner @entity197			0
the @entity199 title is " @entity203 , " and it is about his aunt			0
because it is in the @entity206 section and it 's not in competition , it wo n't get the full red carpet treatment			2
but while the international press is looking the other way , if it 's really good it could stand out from the crowd			2
of course i 'm excited to see a @entity19 movie , but my experience of being at @entity4 is that going to see one of those giant films ends up taking all day long			1
i try to go and see films that i might not ever be able to see again			0
the film i 'm most excited about seeing is @entity18 's " antichrist			1
" it looks sort of " @entity220 " - ish and it is a return to working in @entity199 with @entity174 - known actors			0
i 'm also looking forward to @entity10 's new film			1
the buyer name : @entity226 credentials : senior vice-president , @entity229 , @entity230 @entity4 experience : seven years sometimes a film is going to " pop " where you least expect it , and it 's often not the film with established directors			1
it 's quite difficult to find those -- the ones that create industry buzz , the ones that the critics suddenly go for , but also when you finally do get around to releasing it in your territory that the film actually crosses over and becomes an art house hit			0
i 've already read the scripts for a lot of the films in competition -- you really want to get all of the information and do your homework			0
this year there 's buzz about a film by an @entity261 director , @entity260 , called " @entity262 , " which is being sold by innovative production company @entity263			0
@entity260 has served as a juror on the @entity4 jury before and took home a @entity268 award in 2000 for " @entity269 , " a drama about young @entity261 kurds			2
i 'm also looking forward to " @entity139			0
" it 's going to be interesting to see what @entity274 ' take on a horror movie is going to be			0
the script was off the wall and i want to see how he brings it all together			0
the @entity17 film " @entity283 , " which stars ex-footballer @entity282 , is meant to be fantastic			2
it 's already sold in the @entity53 but the script was wonderful and i think it 's going to be a very distinctive , different film for @entity17			1
feel - good is a very overused term , but people are going to be looking for more feel - good films now anyway .			1

from @entity19 to @entity17 , @entity4 is packed with big names
critic @entity49 's looking forward to @entity10 's " @entity9 "
blogger @entity159 ca n't wait for @entity18 's " antichrist "
buyer @entity226 says people will be looking for " more feel - good films "
