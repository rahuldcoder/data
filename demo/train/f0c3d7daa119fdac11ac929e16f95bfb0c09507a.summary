the police chief in @entity1 , @entity2 , has problems			2
he 's been under intense scrutiny ever since a white officer in his department fatally shot @entity9 - @entity8 teenager @entity7			1
now , government officials familiar with ongoing discussions are saying he is expected to step down as part of an effort by city officials to reform the @entity15			1
chief @entity16 and @entity1 's mayor have denied the reports			1
there 's no denying , however , that @entity16 is in hot water			1
here 's a look at five ways the police chief or his department have sparked outrage in the community : 1			1
body in the street after @entity7 was gunned down , his body lay in the street for four hours in a blazing @entity2 sun. @entity30 would later say that officials could n't reach the area where the body lay because a crowd had gathered , making it too dangerous			1
state sen. @entity37 said the community was " outraged by looking at this body all day long			2
" in an apology a month later , @entity16 would apologize to @entity7 's family			1
" i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son			2
i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove @entity7 from the street , " he said during his video statement			1
investigators were doing " important work " trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours , @entity16 said , but " it was just too long , and i 'm truly sorry for that			2
video of theft as demonstrators clamored for more information about how @entity7 came to lie dead on a @entity1 street , the @entity15 clamped down , releasing little information			2
yet , six days after the shooting -- on the same day police released officer @entity62 's name to the public -- police decided to release video of a robbery in which @entity7 was involved before he died			1
to make matters more confusing , @entity16 told reporters that @entity62 did n't stop @entity7 because of the robbery , but because he was walking in the street			1
this caused many to say " huh ? " the decision to release that store surveillance video , while the @entity15 was keeping so many other details close to the vest , created consternation even among his colleagues			0
@entity77 capt. @entity76 stated the robbery and shooting of @entity7 " are separate issues			2
" " i told ( chief @entity16 ) i think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go , " he told @entity81			1
" today is about taking care of this incident here , getting to those facts that are there , and @entity7 and his family			2
" @entity16 responded that news outlets had requested the video and @entity62 's identification			1
he also said they needed to be released at the same time , but he did n't elaborate as to why			0
@entity7 family attorney @entity96 said the move was " a diversion , and it 's an attempt to smear @entity7 's character			1
heavy - handed response to protests when protesters hit the streets -- and violent elements among them looted and vandalized businesses -- it was n't long before police brought out the heavy weaponry			0
soon , images out of @entity1 included police in riot gear with shields and batons , automatic weapons , police dogs , armored vehicles and police firing rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds			0
it 's important to note that @entity121 was in charge of tactical operations within hours of @entity7 's death , but it all unfolded in @entity1 , and that mattered to many onlookers			1
retired lt. gen. @entity127 , well - versed in unrest after leading recovery efforts for @entity130 , questioned the logic of letting @entity133 teams handle a civil disturbance			0
" the tactics they are using , i do n't know where they learned them from , " he said			0
" it appears they may be making them up on the way , but this is escalating the situation			0
keep walking a common refrain from police to protesters during the demonstrations was , " keep moving			0
" police were arresting or threatening to arrest anyone who stood still along the sidewalks , whether they were just stopping to rest or a reporter taking notes			0
a federal judge ruled that they violated the @entity159 when police told protesters they had to keep walking and that they could n't stand still			0
in some cases , officers told protesters they could n't stand for more than five seconds			0
in others , the protesters were told they were walking too slowly			0
@entity16 would have to include a statement in his video apology on how officers did not protect the people 's freedom to assemble			1
" the right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect			0
if anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry , i feel responsible and i 'm sorry , " the police chief said			2
lack of police diversity some of the complaints against @entity16 stretch back further than @entity7 's shooting			1
" people consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents , from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the @entity1 police force			0
these anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in @entity1 that has received a good deal of attention , " @entity8 attorney general @entity189 told reporters after visiting the area			0
the @entity198 is investigating the @entity15			0
it will look at the department 's use of force , analyze stops , searches and arrests , and examine the treatment of people at @entity1 's city jail			2
many african - americans in @entity1 say that they often found themselves subject to racial profiling , such as being pulled over for no obvious reason besides , they presumed , " @entity212 , " or driving while black			0
the city is a predominately black community with a mostly white police force			0
at the time of @entity7 's shooting , only three of the city 's 53 officers were african - american .			1

chief @entity16 is expected to step down , according to officials
the chief and the mayor say the reports are not true
@entity16 fell under intense scrutiny in the wake of the death of @entity7
he 's apologized but said he has no plans to resign
