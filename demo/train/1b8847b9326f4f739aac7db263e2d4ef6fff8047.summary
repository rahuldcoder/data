-- president @entity1 has said he does n't believe @entity2 can fit a nuclear warhead on a missile , casting strong doubt on an alarming assessment disclosed last week by the @entity8 's intelligence arm			1
and he warned the young @entity2 leader @entity9 that weeks of threats against the @entity11 and @entity12 had only served to isolate the regime further			1
@entity0 's full coverage on @entity2 asked in an @entity19 interview whether @entity2 could put a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile , @entity1 said , " based on our current intelligence assessments , we do not think that they have that capacity			1
" according to a snippet of a document read out by a congressman at a @entity28 hearing last week , the @entity8 's @entity23 believes " with moderate confidence " that the @entity2 has developed nuclear weapons it could deliver on a ballistic missile , although with low reliability			2
@entity11 defense and intelligence officials sought to qualify the @entity23 's words soon after they were made public , saying @entity2 had n't " fully " demonstrated the capabilities mentioned			1
but @entity1 's comments in the @entity19 interview , which was recorded monday and broadcast tuesday , appear to be the strongest dismissal of the assessment yet			0
@entity1 cautioned , though , that amid @entity2 's recent dramatic threats , the @entity11 has to " make sure that we are dealing with every contingency out there			1
" " that 's why i 've repositioned missile defense systems to guard against any miscalculation on their part , " he said , an apparent reference to the recent decision to move missile defenses to @entity53 , a @entity54 territory that is home to @entity11 naval and air bases that the @entity2 has cited as possible targets for attack			1
recent threats @entity60 intensified its threatening language last month when the @entity62 voted to approve tougher sanctions on the @entity2 regime following its latest underground nuclear test			2
joint military exercises under way in @entity12 by @entity11 and @entity12 troops , which take place each year , have also fed the @entity2 's angry rhetoric			2
as well as its torrent of fiery words , which have included the threat of a nuclear attack on the @entity11 and @entity12 , the @entity2 has made a number of moves that have added to tensions on the @entity78			1
it has suspended activity at a manufacturing zone it jointly operates with the @entity12 , vowed to immediately restart a nuclear reactor it shuttered five years ago and moved mobile ballistic missiles to its east coast for what @entity11 and @entity12 officials say could be a possible test launch			2
@entity1 said that @entity2 's recent behavior under @entity9 was both familiar and counterproductive			1
" this is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in and his grandfather before that , " he said , referring to the two previous @entity2 leaders @entity89 and @entity90			2
" since i came into office , the one thing i was clear about was , we 're not going to reward this kind of provocative behavior			0
you do n't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way			0
" ' i 'm not a psychiatrist ' asked if he thought @entity9 was unstable , @entity1 said , " i 'm not a psychiatrist , and , i do n't know the leader of @entity2			1
" but he said that " the actions they 've taken , the rhetoric they 've engaged in has been provocative			0
" he warned that the situation may not calm down in the short term			0
" i think all of us would anticipate that @entity2 will probably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks , " @entity1 said			1
" but our hope is that we can contain it and that we can move into a different phase , in which they try to work through diplomatically some of these issues , so that they can get back on a path where they 're actually feeding their people			0
" the @entity11 - @entity12 military exercises are due to carry on until the end of april			0
on the diplomatic front , @entity11 secretary of state @entity130 visited three of @entity2 's neighbors in the past week -- @entity12 , @entity133 and @entity134 -- and set out the conditions @entity60 would have to meet in order to hold talks with the @entity11			1
" @entity139 has to move toward denuclearization , indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats , stop the testing and indicate it 's actually prepared to negotiate , " @entity130 said in an interview with @entity0 on monday			0
but @entity2 has repeatedly insisted that its nuclear program is a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the @entity11 and its allies			1
' a crafty ploy ' a @entity2 foreign ministry spokesman on tuesday dismissed the @entity11 suggestion of talks as " nothing but a crafty ploy " to deflect blame for the rising tensions			1
the @entity11 urging dialogue is like a robber " calling for a negotiated solution while brandishing his gun , " the spokesman said in a statement published by the @entity2 's state - run @entity164			2
the statement appeared to leave open the possibility of some kind of talks			0
" genuine dialogue is possible only at the phase where the @entity2 has acquired nuclear deterrent enough to defuse the @entity11 threat of nuclear war unless the @entity11 rolls back its hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail against the former , " it said , using the shortened version of @entity2 's official name , the @entity2			1
but @entity179 , senior analyst covering @entity180 for the @entity181 , said that the terms @entity2 had set out were nonstarters			0
@entity60 is saying it is willing to talk only if the rest of the world acquiesces to the status quo of a nuclear - armed @entity2 , a situation unacceptable to the @entity11 and the @entity184 , he said			2
meanwhile , the @entity2 government continued wednesday to prevent @entity12 from entering the @entity190 , the shared manufacturing zone that sits on the @entity2 's side of the border but houses operations of more than 120 @entity12 companies			0
the @entity139 has also pulled out its workers from the complex , who number more than 50,000			0
there had been hopes in @entity12 that the @entity139 might return the situation to normal this week following the major public holiday monday that marked the 101st anniversary of @entity90 , the founder of @entity2			2
but so far , @entity60 has n't budged			0
at the weekend , it dismissed @entity205 's proposal of talks over the complex , saying that what happens next depended on the @entity12 government 's " attitude			0
