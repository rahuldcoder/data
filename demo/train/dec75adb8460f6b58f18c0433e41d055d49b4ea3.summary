-- forget chicken soup or hot tea			0
there are a new batch of home flu remedies -- and they do n't skimp on the alcohol			1
when @entity8 , owner of @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , was young , getting a cold or the flu meant her mother and grandmother would mix up a cocktail of their own cure - all for the winter ills -- a syrup of honey , lemon juice and whiskey			1
she 'd get a spoonful , or get to drink it in a hot lemonade before bed			0
so in 2004 , as those around her sniffled and sneezed their way through a moderately severe flu season , @entity8 thought she could help ease some of the suffering by adding her own twist to the family recipe , turning the syrup into a sorbet so the coldness would add a soothing touch as well			1
the frozen treat contains orange and lemon juices , honey , " ginger , cayenne and liquid pectin -- because it makes it into a cough drop that lubricates your throat , " @entity8 says			1
@entity0 : flu vaccine is 62 % effective , say health officials but the key ingredient is @entity50			2
" the whiskey relaxes you , " she says			0
and there 's a lot of it			2
" enough that it barely stays frozen			0
" when she debuted the treat in 2004 , she also rolled out a kid - friendly version , using a cherry concentrate from a @entity63 farm instead of bourbon			0
@entity8 's @entity65 weathered the @entity66 ( " swine flu " ) scare , and with this year 's flu at epidemic levels , is now flying off shelves at $ 12 a pint in @entity8 's 10 @entity11 stores , forcing her team to extend production hours to meet the growing number of online orders			1
but can a sorbet beat the common cold or the flu ? doctors tell time that the ingredients do n't have any anti-viral properties , meaning they are n't proven to reverse the course of the illness , or prevent you from getting infected			1
but they may give you temporary relief of some symptoms			0
here 's what experts say about the cocktail 's potential benefits : @entity94 and lemon juice			2
both juices are high in vitamin c , but data does not confirm that consuming a lot of vitamin c will make a difference when you are actually sick			2
" it 's probably something that over a long period of time helps you maintain a healthy immune system , but if you take it when you 're actually sick , it does n't do anything to the virus itself , " says dr. @entity103 , assistant professor in the @entity104 at the @entity105 at @entity106 in @entity107			1
5 ways to beat the winter blues cayenne and ginger			0
these spices have anti-inflammatory properties that may make you feel less feverish and reduce the joint pain , headache , and muscle aches that accompany the flu — especially the ingredient capsaicin in pepper			1
" it would be the same as if you took an @entity135 , " says dr. @entity131 , internal medicine physician at @entity132			0
like any spicy food , the cayenne and ginger may also give you the impression that your sinuses are less congested , says @entity103			0
" honey and pectin both provide a coating over the mucous membrane of the throat to soothe any irritation and inflammation , " says dr. @entity143 , an assistant clinical professor at the @entity144 for @entity145			0
honey has anti-bacterial properties and has been used as an antiseptic			0
in fact , says @entity103 , " raw unpasteurized honey has been used for wound healing because it forms a water barrier and helps keeps moisture in the wound			0
" @entity160 is also an ingredient in cough drops			0
sorry , whiskey fans : the @entity50 is not going to cure your cold or flu , though it certainly can make you feel less miserable			1
the bourbon in @entity8 's sorbet is a nod to another traditional alcoholic cold remedy , the " hot toddy , " a steamy mixture of whiskey or brandy , lemon , honey , and sometimes tea			1
the concoction can make you drowsy and help you fall asleep , which is n't a bad thing when you 're sick because rest helps you recovery more quickly			1
why alcohol ? it 's also an antiseptic , so people might have believed that the alcohol would kill the germs in your body			1
but " flu is in a lot of places where beverages do n't reach , " says @entity103			1
" it 's in your nose and in your trachea , and unless you accidentally snort the drink or inhale beverages into your trachea , the liquid is not necessarily going where the flu is infecting			1
" @entity0 : achoo , it 's you ! @entity206 app points the finger at flu spreaders still , there 's something appealing — and marketable — about a homespun flu remedy , especially one that contains some booze			1
restaurants , bars , and distilleries have started advertising special cocktails to help customers beat colds and flu and stay healthy			2
@entity220 reported that @entity221 , a premium tequila company , issued a press release claiming that doctors prescribed tequila to flu sufferers during the 1918 @entity228 flu , suggesting that @entity221 , which is full of agave ( a natural sweetener ) , when mixed with vitamin c - rich lime juice , can help relieve cold and flu symptoms			1
during the 2009 swine flu scare , nightlife news site @entity236 reported that a @entity107 bar called @entity241 was offering a " @entity242 , " which featured " @entity243 and @entity244 , " " the @entity245 , " and " @entity246 " ( worth noting that the site partners with some alcohol beverage companies )			2
and this year , @entity249 in @entity107 -- which is half juice bar , half cocktail lounge -- is serving up a " @entity252 " made with tequila , ginger and carrot juice -- a good source of vitamin a , which can help maintain a healthy immune system			2
but it 's worth remembering that although alcohol may numb you to some of flu 's symptoms , it 's also a diuretic , so indulging can make you lose more fluids than you take in			1
that can make you dehydrated and worsen your flu symptoms			2
no matter how healthy your drink is , staying out late can also tire you out and make you more susceptible to getting sick			2
on the non-alcoholic side , @entity143 adheres to a @entity273 medicinal philosophy that maintains people with colds should consume warm things to make them feel better , not cold things — which supports the chicken soup and hot tea idea			2
" my patients who have chronic sinusitis tell me that their symptoms get worse when they pass by the freezer section of a supermarket			0
" he recommends slurping hot broths with onions or scallions , which contain quercetin , an anti-inflammatory compound that can help to open up congested nasal passages ( think miso soup )			0
with all the home remedies now vying for your attention ( and dollars ) , sometimes a simple strategy is best			2
when it comes to loading up on vitamin and herbal supplements , @entity131 says , " i do n't go with anything that 's expensive and sounds exclusive because if it 's too good to be true , then it 's too good to be true			1
" it all depends on what you expect out of your flu fixer : unfortunately , there is n't much that can make the misery go away completely			1
but if a natural cold and flu remedy makes you feel better and tastes good , enjoy it ; just be realistic that it 's not going to work miracles			1
" if you have to have the flu , you might as well celebrate it , " @entity8 says			1
so if you want to try @entity8 's @entity65 yourself , you can order it online or make it at home : @entity8 's @entity318 ( makes a generous 1 quart ) : 2 cups fresh orange juice ( from 5 to 6 oranges ) 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice ( from about 2 lemons ) 2/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup honey 1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger one 3 - ounce packet liquid pectin 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 2 to 4 tablespoons @entity328 ( optional ) @entity329 combine the orange and lemon juices , sugar , honey , and ginger in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil , stirring to dissolve the sugar			1
chill add the pectin , cayenne , and bourbon , if using			0
pour into a bowl , cover , and refrigerate until cold			0
freeze freeze the sorbet just until it is the consistency of very softly whipped cream			0
( you can eat it now , if you wish ; otherwise , proceed as directed			0
) pack the sorbet into a storage container , press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface , and seal with an airtight lid			0
freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm , at least 4 hours			0
