-- he began his career as a bus driver in @entity4 , then rose through the ranks to become a member of @entity9 president @entity8 's inner circle			1

@entity8 , who is battling cancer , said saturday that @entity10 should replace him " if something were to happen that would incapacitate me			1
" " my firm opinion , as clear as the full moon -- irrevocable , absolute , total -- is ... that you elect @entity10 as president , " @entity8 said , waving a copy of the @entity17 as he spoke			1
" i ask this of you from my heart			0
he is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue , if i can not			0
" the televised address marked the first time the @entity9 president specified whom he wants to be his successor			2
@entity10 , 50 , has long been a high - profile face in @entity8 's administration			1
he is often seen in the front row of @entity8 's press conferences and has traveled to @entity36 as the @entity9 leader undergoes cancer treatment			1

@entity10 is also @entity9 's foreign minister , a position he 's held since 2006			1
in that role , @entity10 has been the @entity51 country 's top diplomat as tensions rose with the @entity53 and ties grew with @entity36			0
" the @entity53 @entity58 is trying to become a sort of world police agency to describe decent citizens of our country ... as drug traffickers , " @entity10 said in 2011 , after the department added four @entity9 officials to its drug kingpin list			2
" a country like that has no moral authority to judge generals and political officials in @entity9 , " @entity10 said			2
" we reject it and we believe that the drug trafficking mafias are there , in a sick society like the @entity53			0
" after security screeners detained him at @entity77 's @entity76 in 2006 , @entity10 called the @entity53 government " racist " and " @entity81 " and said the @entity53 does not appreciate @entity80 countries			0
there are two sides to @entity10 , said @entity84 , a professor of political science at @entity86 in @entity87			0
" on the one hand , he has been behind some of the most radical , crazy foreign policy decisions of the @entity8 administration			1
support for @entity95 , you name it , all the radical decisions , he has been behind them , " @entity84 said			0
" but he also has been behind some of the most pragmatic and conciliatory decisions , including the turnaround in relations with @entity101			0
" that 's a marked contrast with the inflammatory @entity8 , who rarely turns to compromise , @entity84 said			0

he served as a congressman until 2006 , when he was tapped as foreign minister			2
if the president dies , @entity9 's constitution specifies that the vice president assumes the presidency until new elections can be held			1
but analysts have said it 's difficult to determine who would succeed @entity8 , whose personal charisma and popularity have led to throngs of followers who call themselves " chavistas			0
" " you have to ask what 's held things together in @entity9			0
... part of what 's held it together is that @entity8 , despite his government 's problems , is somebody who has a tremendous emotional connection and charisma with a lot of @entity9 , " said @entity129 , president of the @entity131 - based @entity130 think tank			1
" all of the people who are potential successors of @entity8 are people who are polarizing and confrontational , " @entity129 told @entity0 earlier this year			0
" they 're loyal to @entity8 , but they do n't have @entity8 's ability to connect with most @entity9			1
" polls have indicated that although @entity8 still has strong backing from his supporters , other possible successors do n't seem to generate that kind of enthusiasm			0
a february poll by the @entity155 firm showed @entity10 with 9.8 % support among militant members of @entity8 's @entity158			2
but that was before @entity8 's remarks supporting @entity10 on saturday , which will likely bolster support for the vice president within the government and among fervent @entity165 , @entity84 said			1
" when popular presidents make an endorsement , that always has an effect , " @entity84 said			0
" this is an important thing that @entity8 needed to do			0
" when he named @entity10 as vice president in october , @entity8 noted his extensive experience on " different battlefronts			1
" " the bourgeoisie make fun of @entity10 because he was a bus driver , " @entity8 said , " and look where he 's going now			1
