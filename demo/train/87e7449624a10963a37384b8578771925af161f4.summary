-- @entity1 is a football player			1
" so what ? " he says			2
" being gay is not a choice -- i hate it when people say that			1
" in march 2011 , @entity1 , who plays in the lower leagues in @entity9 , became the first man to come out in more than 20 years within the world of football			1
fast forward two years and , while his life has changed immeasurably , the same problems remain			0
" there 's so much ignorance , " he told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
" there 's a lack of knowledge			1
some people who are homophobic do n't even know a gay person			1
it 's all about preconceptions			1
" i hear that football players are supposed to be masculine			1
i know plenty of straight guys who are more effeminate			0
" there 's this illusion that every football player has to be macho and have a model girlfriend			1
it 's not acceptable to be a gay player			1
" why not ? we can run , we can play , we can score			0
so what 's the problem ? " the fight against homophobia in football has been stepped up in the @entity41 in particular , with the " @entity42 " campaign taking center stage over recent days			1
@entity45 , a @entity41 - based gay , lesbian and bisexual charity , teamed up with @entity51 bookmaker @entity49 to promote the initiative -- which urged players to wear the colored laces to promote awareness			1
the organization sent laces to all 92 professional clubs in @entity59 and the 42 in @entity60 but enjoyed only limited success , with clubs unhappy with the inclusion of a gambling firm and a lack of notice given by the charity			0
many football fans took to @entity68 to say they were unable to even see the laces , especially with players often boasting luminous footwear , while some professionals decided against wearing them for a multitude of reasons			1
' it needs to be discussed ' but while he supports the campaign -- @entity1 wore the laces during his most recent game -- he stresses that it is only a small step in bringing about a meaningful change in attitudes towards homophobia			1
" i think it 's a good idea , " he said , after laughing that he had hit the post when he should have scored in that previous match			1
" it 's not a big change but it is a step forward			1
it 's the least we can do			1
we can have lectures , we can ban people -- and laces wo n't change the mind of an idiot			0
" a homophobe wo n't change his mind because players are wearing rainbow laces , but we 're putting it into their minds and we 're putting the issue into society so we can talk about it			2
" it might make people more aware and make them reconsider but it 's not going to make people come out instantly			2
" we can talk about it and discuss it			0
it needs to be discussed			0
there are not many players out there ( wearing them ) but it 's a nice gesture			1
" i 've heard some idiotic excuses			0
i respect anyone who does n't want to ( wear them ) and has strong opinions on the matter but do n't give lame excuses			0
" there are a lot of different things we can do -- but this shows some players are ready to show their support			2
seeing a professional wearing them is great and gives comfort to gay people who are playing and are n't ready to come out			2
" who 's next ? in february , @entity139 soccer player @entity138 revealed he is gay but at the same time announced he was retiring from the sport			1
@entity138 , who was playing in @entity59 at the time , has since reversed his decision to quit and now plays back in his homeland with @entity146 side @entity145			0
but not since the tragic death of @entity148 has a top - flight division witnessed an openly gay professional football player			1
@entity148 , who committed suicide in 1998 , became the first Â£ 1 million black player in the history of @entity59 football when he signed for @entity155 in 1981			1
constant speculation surrounded his private life , and at one time he reportedly claimed he 'd had affairs with @entity159 -- which further fueled media interest			0
with the rumors continuing throughout his career , he finally came out in 1990 and continued to play for a whole host of lower league clubs			0
" you have to understand , " he said in an interview before his death , " that footballers are very narrow - minded people			0
it 's the nature of the business			2
when you put yourself in the firing line , you are open to attack			0
i know i 'm there to be shot down in flames			0
" following his passing , one particular group of fans would recite the chant : " he 's gay , he 's dead , he 's hanging in a shed , @entity177 , @entity177			1
" ' i hope someone else will come out ' while there has been huge progress since those dark days , the presence of homophobia in football has not been extinguished			2
@entity1 had hoped that he would become a trailblazer -- but @entity138 aside , there has been little movement in terms of players coming out			1
" i 've had quite a few anonymous phone calls from players who want to come out but i do n't know who they are or where they play , " said @entity1			1
" i hope that someone else will come out just like @entity138 did			0
that was great for @entity139 soccer			0
at last we 're having a discussion about it and that 's huge			2
" it has been pretty quiet and i understand that			0
people might not want to come out publicly and i understand			0
" for me , the whole experience has been really positive			0
i 've not had any trouble at all			0
if somebody says something , then i do n't care			0
i do n't have time for any of that			0
i do n't waste my energy on that			0
" lately it has been really good -- i do n't know why it 's a problem			2
" putting the gay in games but it 's not just in football where the problem exists -- the @entity223 have also courted controversy following the @entity227 government 's decision to implement a new law banning " propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors			1
" there have been protests across the globe , with some athletes threatening to boycott the @entity219 over what they believe are archaic and draconian laws			2
@entity227 says the legislation is intended to protect children by prohibiting discussion of gay rights and relationships within their earshot			1
" i do n't understand what 's happening in @entity227 , " sighs @entity1			1
" what year are we in ? " it 's like the @entity247 out there			1
it 's their country and i respect that but it 's all about human rights			2
" athletes are n't going there because of their sexuality			0
you 're going there to perform your sport -- you go out there and play and do your best			0
" you 're not living there -- you 're just going to compete			0
it 's difficult because you have to respect their laws but it 's ridiculous how we treat people in the 21st century			1
" i know a few people going but i 'd never go			0
i 'll watch at home on television			0
" football family @entity1 is not shy in giving his views -- although he does squirm at the thought that he has become some kind of spokesman for gay sports stars : " i always speak from the heart and do n't care what i say			1
" with a strong family around him , he has grown into a confident and aspiring young man who quickly realized that his life would never be the same			0
but by his own admission , the fact that he is the son of @entity288 , the former @entity289 and @entity9 international footballer , may have given him an advantage which others may not be as fortunate to enjoy			0
as a player , his father won the now defunct @entity295 twice with @entity9 side @entity296 before moving to @entity59 , where he won the league title in 1991			2
he is now on the coaching staff at @entity1 's third division club @entity299 , while brothers @entity301 and @entity303 are also professional footballers			1
dancing star but @entity1 is famous in his own right -- his story an inspiration to millions around the world -- while he cites his victory in @entity9 's " @entity311 " as another reason for his current popularity			1
" in @entity9 i get recognized a lot from my football but also from the dancing , " he laughs			2
" i did n't think people would care that much but it 's nice			2
" when i first came out i thought i would be in the newspapers in @entity9 for a couple of days and that 's it -- i did n't think people would really care to be honest			2
" and then suddenly it went crazy , and within two days the whole world knew , but it feels pretty good			0
i know that i 've done something good with my life			0
" i was just a kid who happened to be gay -- i never thought it would be such a big deal			2

@entity1 was the second active football player to come out as openly gay
he has received calls from players too *scared* to come out in the game
labels @entity227 's *anti-gay* laws as " @entity247 " ahead of 2014 @entity223
hopes he can help fellow gay players to come out in the future
