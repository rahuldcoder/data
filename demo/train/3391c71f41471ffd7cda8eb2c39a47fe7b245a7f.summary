-- do n't throw out your roller bag just yet			0
officials in the @entity5 city of @entity6 are denying a reported ban on wheeled luggage , saying they wo n't impose large fines on tourists using them			1
last week they were widely quoted saying they hoped draft laws to be introduced in may 2015 would curb damage and disturbance from noisy bags			1
the prospect of fines of up to 500 euros ( $ 620 ) generated uproar and concerns about how many of the 22 million tourists who annually visit @entity6 would cart their luggage into a destination with restricted access to vehicles			1
now the city 's special commissioner , @entity24 , has issued a statement insisting proposed new noise regulations will only be directed at trolleys used by traders and are not intended as an outright prohibition			1
" i firmly deny that the municipality of @entity6 has ever thought to ban the use of trolleys in the historical center , " he said			0
' preservation of serenity ' the new regulations , he insisted , will apply solely to " handcarts and transpallets transporting goods on the pedestrian paths , " which he said cause severe erosion to @entity6 's historic paving			2
" this is particularly annoying when it happens in the early hours of the day , when many people are still sleeping			0
" he added : " this does n't mean , however , that the municipality will ban the use of them starting from may			0
the draft seeks only to regulate			0
" despite the denial , @entity24 said he hoped the furore surrounding reports of restrictions on wheeled luggage would prompt the tourism industry to address the issue of noisy bags			1
he echoed earlier comments , reported by the local @entity64 newspaper , in which he was quoted saying a ban would hopefully inspire luggage manufacturers to introduce softer , air - filled tires			2
" this will undoubtedly be a deserving action that will contribute to the preservation of our architectural heritage and to the serenity of residents and tourists themselves , " he said .			0

@entity79 special commissioner @entity24 says rules on noise restriction have been *misinterpreted*
he says a *maximum* 500 euro fine will not apply to wheeled luggage being used in the city
@entity24 says he hopes the furore will nevertheless *encourage* the tourism to address noisy baggage issue
