a spectacular @entity1 - themed festival kicking off in the @entity2 has been stoked by controversy after two participants refused to shave off their beards			1
the men were preparing for the region 's midwinter up @entity10 festival -- a highlight of the tourist calendar -- but their facial hair was judged incompatible with emergency breathing equipment they were obliged to don as fire fighters on their home island of @entity17			1
the pair 's stance has thus deprived the tiny isle of a fire team until the festivities wind up , the @entity18 reports			0
the " beard protest " may testify to the significance of @entity10 to the inhabitants of this remote group of islands strung out between the @entity2 mainland and @entity29			2
or it may point to the importance of beard size to @entity35 men			2
either way , it does seem risky to be without a fire crew amid a season of celebrations whose main event , taking place tuesday in the @entity35 capital of @entity43 , is described by organizers as " @entity47 's largest fire festival			1
" @entity49 delights the fiery festival includes a torch - lit procession through town and culminates in the burning of a replica viking longship -- all broadcast live online			1
up @entity10 ( it sounds best if you shout it ) may commemorate the @entity35 ' ancient @entity1 heritage -- hence the importance of big bushy beards -- but the festival itself began only a little more than a century ago			1
it 's the continuation of an older and even more fun - sounding bit of midwinter revelry that involved young men dragging burning tar barrels through their village and generally causing mischief			0
when tar - barelling was banned , to the sound of much presumed @entity74 tut - tutting , it was replaced in the 1880s by the tamer torch parades and other pieces of incendiary merriment that have continued to this day on the @entity35 , barring adjournments for the death of @entity82 and two world wars			1
a jarl and his guizers as part of tuesday 's @entity43 celebrations , a procession of up to a thousand torch - bearing " guisers " in @entity1 fancy dress are led through town by a head " jarl			1
" the party sets ablaze a mocked - up longship in what begs to be interpreted as an ambivalent commemoration of the raping and pillaging @entity101 contribution to the local gene pool			2
the jarl ( it means " nobelman " in @entity106 ; " guiser " means " disguised person " in @entity109 ) sets the fashion tone for the parade with a costume handed down to his successor every year			0
its original items , the @entity10 website records , included " a silver helmet , with raven 's wings ... a corselet with sleeves of silver mail ... thigh - length black stockings and ... rawhide sandals fastened with tan leather thongs criss - crossed over the instep and all the way up the thighs			1
" one wonders what the @entity2 equivalent of " i 'm a lumberjack " is			0
the jarl 's " guiser squad " make their own weapons -- and grow their own beards -- throughout the year , including battle axes , swords , spears and crossbows			0
torch songs they also do a lot of singing , with lines such as : worthy sons of @entity147 make @entity148 be our encircling @entity151 visions backward take @entity152 the @entity154 's fun'ral pyre			0
no wonder authorities are worried about fire risks			0
to return to which subject , a @entity35 safety board member , @entity159 , described the @entity17 firefighters ' refusal to lose their bushy symbols of @entity164 manhood -- thus " putting the safety of @entity17 people at risk " -- as " crazy [ and ] mind - boggling			2
" the crewmen themselves , possibly too busy preparing their beards for the big day , could not be reached for comment .			0

@entity1 - themed fire festival kicks off in @entity35
two " vikings " were banned from a local fire - fighting crew for refusing to shave
*ironic* , because @entity10 is pretty incendiary
a torchlit procession culminates in the *immolation* of a *longboat*
