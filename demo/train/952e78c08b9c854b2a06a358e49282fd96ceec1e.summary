-- @entity1 buys a first - class ticket to @entity3 on @entity4			1
but it turns out the ticket is in economy class			1
when she tries to get a refund on the fare difference , her online agency offers her a $ 400 voucher			1
is that enough ? and is she entitled to more ? a passenger bought first - class tickets to @entity3 , but learned they were economy - class seats			1
q : we bought two first - class airline tickets to @entity3 on @entity4 through @entity18			1
but we soon found out they were economy - class seats			1
we 've asked the airline for a $ 1,100 refund -- the price difference between first - class and economy - class tickets -- but it wo n't budge			1
@entity18 sent a $ 400 voucher that we do n't want			2
we 've disputed the ticket charges with @entity27 , but it has denied our claim			1
it 's obvious to us we did n't receive what we paid for			0
we 've never sued anyone and i would rather not have to go there			0
do you have any other suggestions ? -- @entity1 , @entity37 , @entity38 a : if you did n't get a first - class seat , you should n't have to pay for one			1
@entity4 owes you a refund of the fare difference between the two classes			2
and your online travel agency , @entity18 , should help you			2
at the very least , you would expect @entity27 to take your side in a dispute			0
so what happened ? from what i can tell , you booked what you thought was a first - class ticket through your online agent			1
but the airline only delivered a seat in economy class			2
in fact , it never treated this as a first - class reservation in the first place			1
was there a miscommunication between the agent and the airline ? or between your agent and you ? maybe			0
as far as i can tell , @entity66 does n't have a service guarantee comparable to the other big online travel agencies , which promises everything about your trip will be perfect			2
but it 's reasonable to expect that the products it sells will be on the up - and - up , and that if there 's something wrong , it will fix it			0
@entity66 ' $ 400 voucher was a nice gesture , but not enough			2
why ? two reasons : first , it requires you to buy another ticket or hotel room , and second , it does n't come close to making up the price difference between the two tickets			2
as i read your letter , it seems as if you spent some time on the phone with @entity66 and @entity4			2
writing to the two companies might have yielded a more favorable result			0
this is one of the rare times when you should have considered sending either a paper letter that included your confirmation and your boarding pass , or , if you 're good with a pc and a scanner , an email with documents attached			0
receipts are important to resolving this dispute			0
you need to prove you did n't get what you paid for			0
since you were doing business with an @entity109 company -- @entity66 -- @entity27 should have sided with you			1
invoking the @entity110 , the federal law that protects you from charges for goods and services you did n't accept or were n't delivered as agreed , might have encouraged @entity27 to see things your way			0
i think @entity4 , @entity66 and @entity27 failed to meet their customer - service obligations			1
but who 's responsible for your refund ? the correct answer is : the online travel agent who took your money and acted as an intermediary for the transaction			0
i contacted @entity66 on your behalf			1
a representative contacted you and said the company reviewed its phone transcripts and determined that it was at fault			0
the online agency refunded you $ 1,100 and let you keep the $ 400 voucher for the trouble			0
@entity134 is the ombudsman for @entity137 magazine			0
