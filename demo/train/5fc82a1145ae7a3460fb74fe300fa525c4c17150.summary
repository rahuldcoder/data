-- a man who was sexually abused by former @entity5 assistant football coach @entity4 has settled his civil suit against the university -- the first to do so , his lawyer said			1
during @entity4 's trial last year , the man was known as @entity10			1
victim 5 's lawyer , @entity11 , said the settlement terms are bound by a confidentiality agreement with the school , but that " the compensation was fair and adequate			1
" " my client is relieved , " @entity11 told @entity0			2
" this has been a long process			0
there has been for him a very public reliving of horror he experienced as a child			0
" @entity4 , 69 , was convicted in june 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse , ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse			2
he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison			2
at the sentencing , victim 5 told the court @entity4 's punishment " will never erase what he did to me			1
" " it will never make me whole , " he said			0
" he must pay for his crimes , take into account the tears , the pain , the private anguish			0
" ' because of you , i trust no one ' the university still faces 30 other suits			1
it has set aside $ 60 million for payouts			1
@entity11 said 25 or 26 of the suits are expected to be settled in the next week or two			2
@entity5 sent a statement to @entity0 saying , " the university continues to make progress on multiple settlements but does not have a comment at this time			2
" @entity11 called the settlement involving victim 5 " win , win			1
" @entity5 , he said , has accepted " responsibility " and " has earned a right to move forward			0
" @entity11 said @entity10 has agreed to bring no further claims against the school as part of the deal			0
@entity66 files motion to have name changed the abuse @entity4 sexually assaulted @entity10 in august 2001 , six months after then - graduate assistant @entity70 walked in on @entity4 raping a boy in a campus shower -- and reported it to college officials			1
victim 5 was also assaulted in @entity5 showers , @entity11 said			1
during @entity4 's sentencing , victim 5 told the court he will never forget the image of @entity4 " forcing himself on me and forcing my hand on him			1
" @entity4 's life in prison at least three of @entity4 's known victims were abused after 2001 , according to testimony at last year 's trial of the former @entity88 defensive coordinator			1
the victims have sued the school , saying it knew about the abuse but did n't act on that knowledge			0
opinion : @entity4 sentence does n't bring instant justice the fallout the sex abuse scandal led to the 2011 firing of @entity5 's head football coach , @entity99 , and the ouster of the university 's longtime president @entity101			1
@entity99 died last year of lung cancer			0
last month , a judge ruled that @entity101 and two senior administrators will face trial on obstruction of justice and other charges related to the scandal			0
state prosecutors allege that @entity101 , former athletic director @entity112 and former senior vice president @entity113 all knew about two allegations made against @entity4 in 1998 and in 2001 , but lied about their knowledge when a grand jury convened several years later			2
@entity118 officials accused of ' conspiracy of silence ' all three men have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them			0
victim 5 might testify in their trials , his lawyer said			1
he was assaulted shortly after the incident @entity70 witnessed in the same location -- an act that could have been prevented had proper reporting taken place , @entity11 said			2
" the incident that involved my client could have and should have been stopped , " @entity11 said			0
attorneys for the three claim there is no evidence of a cover - up			0
yet prosecutors characterized their actions as a conscious decision not to call police			0
" there was a conspiracy of silence , " prosecutor @entity142 said during the july hearing			0
" they are not relieved of criminal responsibility because their conspiracy worked for 10 years			0
" @entity4 attempts to discredit witness from prison @entity0 's @entity153 contributed to this report .			1
