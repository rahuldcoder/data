@entity0 appears to have had enough of one of its affiliates fighting in @entity4 : the @entity5			1
the group has been locked in conflict with other @entity9 factions and gained a grim reputation for abuses in parts of @entity4 it controls , including summary executions and mass killings			1
a statement posted on jihadist forums sunday and purportedly issued by @entity0 's @entity18 said " it has no connection with the group " and blamed it for " the enormity of the disaster that afflicted the @entity22 in @entity4			1
" the @entity0 statement , translated by the @entity24 , follows more than a month of intense factional fighting between the @entity5 with other @entity9 groups in northern and eastern @entity4			1
the @entity4 observatory of @entity28 says it has documented 1,747 people killed in the past four weeks alone but suspects that the real number is substantially higher			0
in recent days , the @entity31 has targeted senior figures in other groups			2
on sunday , two senior rebel leaders were killed near @entity35 -- along with 14 others -- when an @entity31 member who was supposedly conducting truce negotiations with them blew himself up , according to the observatory			0
the previous day , @entity31 fighters assassinated @entity41 , a senior commander in the powerful @entity43 brigade , near the city of @entity45			0
observers say the internecine fighting has played into the @entity50 regime 's hands , distracting other @entity9 factions from their campaign against the @entity4 military			1
it seems that @entity0 's political leadership has signed off on the latest statement disowning the @entity31			1
its publication by as - @entity59 , the organization 's official media wing , gives it considerable weight			2
@entity63 , senior analyst at @entity64 , a @entity65 - based group that analyzes jihadi pronouncements , says the statement is " straight to the point and one that leaves no room for doubt : ' @entity5 does not represent us ! ' " the statement indicated that @entity0 was never consulted or informed about the establishment of such a group and plainly said there is no organizational connection or link " between them , @entity63 said			1
from the @entity65 point of view , @entity0 's move to cut ties to the group is " unprecedented " in recent history , according to a @entity65 official directly familiar with the latest intelligence analysis			1
he notes that this year , @entity0 leader @entity86 ordered the @entity31 to defer to another affiliate , the @entity87 , as the main @entity0 organization inside @entity4			0
" we have n't seen this kind of disobedience before			0
it 's a strategic affront " to @entity86 and @entity0 , the official says			2
the official notes that @entity94 has consistently been trying to prove his own importance and relevance to the organization , but this latest statement appears to go beyond that effort to control a rising affiliate			2
@entity94 's exasperation with the @entity31 is well - known			2
the bad blood between the groups goes back nearly a year			2
in april , the @entity31 's leader , @entity105 , suddenly announced its expansion from @entity107 into @entity4 and declared that it was absorbing the @entity87 , which had by then become one of the most effective fighting forces against the @entity4 regime			1
both @entity87 and @entity94 rejected the @entity31 's takeover attempt			2
@entity87 's leader said simply that " the @entity87 's banner will remain as it is , without changing anything			2
" in a letter in june , @entity86 declared that @entity87 was " an independent branch of @entity0 that follows @entity0 's @entity18 " and instructed the @entity5 to disband and return to @entity107			1
the @entity31 rejected @entity94 's instruction , in a rare act of open defiance toward the global leadership of @entity0			2
an audio message attributed to @entity105 said , " we will not compromise , and we will not give up			0
" @entity87 and fighters from the @entity5 continued to cooperate on a local level , but tensions between the two groups over objectives and methods continued			1
other @entity9 factions complained that the @entity31 was more interested in setting up its own emirate in northern @entity4 than in fighting the @entity50 regime			1
the @entity31 has begun imposing sharia law in towns it controls like @entity133 and @entity134 , forcing women to wear the full veil , or niqab , in public and banning music			0
that complaint is echoed in the statement from the @entity18 , which says , " we do not rush to announce emirates and states over which the scholars of the mujahedeen and their command and the rest of the mujahedeen and the @entity146 did not consult			0
" pressure on the @entity5 has mounted in the past two months , especially with the formation of an umbrella group of @entity9 fighting groups called the @entity153			1
observers say the @entity87 can probably marshal between 40,000 and 50,000 fighters			0
while cooperating quietly with @entity87 , it has been involved in clashes with fighters from the @entity5			1
an influential cleric among @entity4 jihadists , @entity158 , has even suggested that some @entity31 members are working for the @entity4 mukhabarat or secret police			0
@entity158 said in december , " we are not accusing everyone in @entity5 to be agents , but the majority of your commanders are indeed			1
" there also appears to have been internal dissent in the @entity5			1
a video appeared on @entity9 websites in december announcing a " corrective movement within the @entity5			1
" last month , @entity86 renewed his appeal for unity among jihadist groups in @entity4 , saying in an audio message , " our hearts are bleeding , the heart of our @entity5 nation is bleeding when we see the internal strife among the mujahedeen in @entity4			1
" @entity31 leader @entity183 responded in less than contrite terms , saying his " fighters will defend themselves from attacks , and asking elements from opposition groups in @entity107 and @entity4 to repent or suffer consequences			0
" his appeal was taken up by a prominent figure in jihadist circles , @entity193			0
a @entity194 said to be a key financier of radical @entity4 factions , @entity193 announced that he would try to mediate between the rival groups			0
but in an audio statement released sunday , he turned on the @entity31 , saying it had " rejected the initiative that was accepted by all the other factions to stop the bloodshed of @entity146 in @entity4			0
" @entity193 's views are echoed in another statement issued by @entity59 and attributed to a senior @entity0 ideologue , @entity205			1
he stresses that " there is no way to manage this definitive battle in the history of the @entity210 except by unifying with the good people under a pure banner that everyone agrees with and is not enforced upon them			0
" @entity64 's @entity63 sees that as directed at the @entity31			0
despite being ostracized by fellow jihadists , the @entity31 seems confident of its destiny			0
according to @entity224 of the @entity225 , " the @entity5 is also bringing in much larger numbers of foreign fighters , including approximately 900 @entity219 , many of whom are learning to use sophisticated weapons and small unit tactics			1
" @entity226 , @entity227 and many fighters from other @entity230 countries have also joined the group			0
@entity224 said in december that the tensions between the @entity31 and other groups represent a deepening rift in @entity0			0
" @entity5 is the most direct descendant of @entity236 ( who led @entity0 in @entity107 until his death in 2006 ) and the violence - first , absolutist strain of @entity0			2
the conflict between these groups is indicative of larger tensions in the @entity0 enterprise			0
" @entity63 sees the next stage of this conflict as bringing @entity87 and groups within the @entity153 closer , an " emerging sign of powerhouse jihad			0
combining two of the most effective jihadi forces in @entity4 will tip the balance of power " against the @entity31 , he says			0
90 killed in punishing air raids in @entity4 's @entity35 @entity4 government non-committal on more talks ' @entity50 made beggars out of his people : ' @entity4 refugees flood into @entity258			1
