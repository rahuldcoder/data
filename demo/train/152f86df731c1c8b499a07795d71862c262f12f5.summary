-- for all the majesty of the @entity3 , the first lady has already infused it with a palpable ease ; her presence makes the place feel open and approachable			1
when we sit down to talk , @entity8 seems as relaxed as she did when i first interviewed her and her husband in their @entity14 apartment in 2004			1
" this room has the best light in the house , " she tells me as we settle in , shoes off , on a comfortable sofa			0
" and there 's pie here , too			2
the pie in the @entity3 is dangerously good			2
" -- @entity23 @entity8 is the first person to join @entity23 on the cover of @entity25 @entity23 : how are you a different woman today than you were when @entity27 announced his candidacy in 2007 ? @entity8 : i 'm more optimistic			1
it comes from traveling all over @entity31 and connecting with so many different people			2
and this was long before anyone thought @entity27 had a chance			0
this was the kindness of strangers			0
i think we should all have to get to know one another around kitchen tables			0
it 's helped me to give other people the benefit of the doubt			1
@entity23 : what did you see that changed you ? @entity8 : i saw our shared values			1
we fundamentally want the same things for ourselves and for each other			0
we want our kids to be safe and to grow up with some resources and aspire to a slightly better life than ours			0
no one 's looking for a handout			2
people just want fairness and opportunity			2
@entity0 : the heart and mind of @entity8 @entity23 : that 's so good to hear			1
because you know what ? we live in an " @entity73 " culture where it seems like everyone just wants to be in the spotlight			0
@entity8 : that 's not the @entity76 saw			1
they 're rooting for one another			0
even in places where i thought people would n't accept or relate to me , i always walked out feeling like , " wow -- that was fun			2
and it helped prepare me for this			0
because i think if you 're going to be first lady , you have to believe in the possibility of what this country stands for			2
you have to see it in action and know what you 're working toward			0
@entity0 : how @entity8 gets unstuck @entity23 : that 's so interesting -- and it all came from sitting around kitchen tables			1
speaking of which , did you change your diet during the campaign ? @entity8 : when we first started running , my big concern was making sure we ate well on the road			1
so we started looking at our diet , trying to eliminate junk , getting seasonal fruits and vegetables that were grown locally			2
we walked the kids through reading labels			2
we talked about why one juice might be better than another			0
@entity23 : that 's right			1
in addition to eating well , do you work out ? @entity8 : yes			1
there 's a small gym here that has everything we need			2
i work out about four or five days a week -- and @entity27 does six			0
he 's a workout zealot			2
@entity23 : well , you look better than ever -- despite the rumors that you 've got a baby bump			1
] i know -- i was like , " baby bump ? as hard as i work on my abs ? ! " @entity23 : okay , so that 's settled			1
you do treadmill ? @entity8 : i do treadmill , i do weights @entity23 : i think anyone who saw you on the cover of @entity136 knows you do weights			1
those arms ! @entity8 : i also do some jump rope , some kickboxing -- and i 'd like to take up pilates , if i could figure out whether there 's time			1
after i had @entity144 , i began to prioritize exercise because i realized that my happiness is tied to how i feel about myself			1
i want my girls to see a mother who takes care of herself , even if that means i have to get up at 4:30 so i can do a workout			0
@entity23 : when you first told me that a few years ago , i was like , " you get up at 4:30 to work out ? " @entity8 : well , i just started thinking , if i had to get up to go to work , i 'd get up and go to work			1
if i had to get up to take care of my kids , i 'd get up to do that			0
but when it comes to yourself , then it 's suddenly , " oh , i ca n't get up at 4:30			1
" so i had to change that			0
if i do n't exercise , i wo n't feel good			1
of course , it 's easier to do it here , because i have much more support now			0
but i always think about women who do n't have support			0
that 's why work - family balance is n't just a policy conversation ; it 's about changing the expectations of who we have to be as women and parents			0
@entity23 : what you mentioned earlier is key : we have to ask for help			1
you ca n't do it all			0
@entity8 : that 's a conversation i 'd love for us to have as a society			1
how do we set expectations that are attainable ? @entity23 : so what do you know for sure , @entity8 ? @entity8 : i know that all i can do is be the best me that i can			1
and live life with some gusto			0
giving back is a big part of that			0
how am i going to share this experience with the @entity31 people ? i 'm always thinking about that			0
