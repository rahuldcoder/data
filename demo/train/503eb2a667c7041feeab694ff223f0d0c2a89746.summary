@entity0 , @entity1 -- this week 's burst of catastrophic bushfires in @entity1 continues a run of extreme weather events that , aside from the toll in human suffering , is pushing up the cost of doing business in the @entity1 agricultural sector			1
@entity1 is one of the world 's most efficient food producers , particularly of grain , meat , dairy , fruit , vegetables and wine			1
it vies with other exporters such as @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 for a large slice of the $ 1 trillion a year global market for imported food			2
and in a world where contaminated soil , acid rain , poisonous water , disease and pestilence blights much of the food production capacity in the big consuming nations of @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity1 's reputation for a clean and relatively unstressed growing environment has given it a marketing edge			1
but over the last decade its primary producers have had to run a gauntlet of climatic extremes that is testing both their resolve and their resources			1
with 20 % of @entity1 classified as desert , farmers have always had to be conscious of how , when and where to use their soil , water , fertilizer and other agricultural inputs			2
the new problem for @entity1 farmers is the business cost of volatility , exemplified by the intensity , duration and extent of these catastrophic weather events			1
droughts are longer , fires are fiercer , hailstorms are more damaging and floods cover greater parts of a country that is 50 % larger than @entity70 and is exceeded in size only by @entity72 , @entity25 , @entity40 , the @entity73 and @entity23			0
photos : catastrophic fires threaten @entity1 years of drought in the 2000s culminated in the deadly " @entity82 " bushfires in @entity80 state in february 2009 that claimed 173 lives , wiping out whole towns and hundreds of farms in the process			2
those fires were followed by devastating floods across @entity87 and @entity88 in 2010 - 11 that took another 33 lives and affected 2.5 million people , with insurance payouts of $ 2.5 billion , according to the @entity92 of @entity1 , and a total financial impact estimated by the @entity94 at more than $ 5 billion			1
now @entity1 's focus is on bushfires again , and the impact it might have on export - oriented food production			1
while sheep and cattle losses have already been extensive , there are other farming sectors at risk , too , such as wine			0
@entity1 wine exports are worth about $ 2 billion a year , according to @entity106 , with new consumers in @entity40 and other parts of @entity109 driving a trend to lighter , sweeter red and white wines			1
in the @entity113 150 km ( 93 miles ) north of @entity0 , mid-january is harvest time in what has long been recognized as one of @entity1 's premium wine growing areas			1
every year , the valley 's winemakers await the long , hot , dry days of the southern hemisphere summer that increases the sugar content and intensifies the flavor of the grapes			0
with the right combination of daytime heat and a smattering of light rain at night to cool the soil , they stand a chance of creating a standout vintage			0
the 2013 vintage had been shaping as just such a year , until a lingering continental - scale " heat cell " over inland @entity1 sent temperatures soaring and sparked this week 's bushfires in four southern states			1
vines that thrive at 30 degrees @entity141 ( 86 degrees @entity140 ) are stressed and shriveled when the mercury climbs to 40 degrees @entity141 ( 104 degrees @entity140 ) and beyond			0
for the @entity113 's winemakers , timing is everything			0
in the next few days they must decide whether to send in the first waves of grape pickers , or hold off a bit longer in the hope of creating even greater flavors			0
if they do delay , they run the risk of losing the crop to heat stress , or worse , losing their precious vines to a bushfire			0
after several days of 40 - plus temperatures this week and a forecast for temperatures in the @entity113 to reach 42 degrees @entity141 ( 107.6 degrees @entity140 ) again on saturday , plus the possibility of thunderstorms , the winemakers face some tough decisions			0
@entity1 , of course , is not alone in facing a more unpredictable weather regime			2
weather forecasters and climatologists around the world point to events that seem to suggest that even if the planet is not getting hotter , it is getting more volatile			0
@entity175 in the @entity73 , drought in @entity178 's @entity177 , a bitter cold snap in @entity70 and floods in @entity40 were just some of the severe weather events of 2012			1
longer - term , what the @entity183 @entity182 ( @entity182 ) calls " slow - onset " climate change is seen as likely to have a heavy impact on food production in developing nations			0
according to the @entity182 , climate change could have potentially disastrous consequences for food security in the period 2050 - 2100			1
the @entity182 estimates that a billion people around the world now lack food security			2
to meet projected food demand by 2050 , when the world 's population will have grown from 7 billion now to about 9 billion , it says global agricultural production will need to grow 60 % above the level of 2007			2
that will test the resourcefulness of farmers not just in @entity1 but in other great " food bowls " across the world , from @entity23 to @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity73 .			0

extreme weather pushing up cost of doing business in the @entity1 agricultural sector
primary food producers have had to run a gauntlet of climatic extremes
@entity1 's $ 2 billion - a - year wine *industry* is one area at risk from bushfires
but volatile weather events threaten food security well beyond @entity1
