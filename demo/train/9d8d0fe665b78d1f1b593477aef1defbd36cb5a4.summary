@entity0 -- the @entity3 double killing tantalized @entity4 : a 22 - year - old woman and her fiance 's brother were found shot , both in the head , in a car in a @entity0 mall parking lot			1
then @entity13 's fiance went missing , prompting a monthlong search that officially ended thursday when authorities identified a body found in a car 100 miles away in @entity18 as that of @entity20 , 24			1
what some first speculated as a love triangle gone wrong with two brothers has now become something more complicated -- a triple murder case in which authorities are still seeking suspects and explanations			1
@entity32 's body , decomposed in his own car trunk , was identified by fingerprint , and his death was ruled a homicide , @entity18 police said thursday			1

it all began after @entity13 finished work at a @entity42 that was open late for @entity3 shoppers in @entity44			2

police and the coroner in @entity18 on thursday declined to comment about their investigation into @entity67 's homicide			1
" there was a lot of idiotic speculation that @entity67 had something to do with the shooting or that he had possibly harmed himself , that he might have fled , that he was in a jealous rage and did this , " said @entity76 , who was such close friends with @entity13 that he has a tattoo of her likeness on the inside of his left forearm			1
" anyone who knows the family , anyone who knows @entity67 and @entity94 's relationship completely understands that there is no possible way that could have ever happened , " @entity76 told @entity1 on wednesday			2
@entity59 had worked for a year at a vintage clothing store that @entity76 owned , he said			2
investigators have n't disclosed a motive in the double murders at the mall , other than they have ruled out robbery			0
" in looking through the evidence at the scene , it does not appear that any sort of robbery took place during this incident , " @entity0 lt. @entity103 said			0

" she was with @entity67 for a very long time			0
they loved each other deeply			0
and she really cared about @entity135 , " @entity76 said			0
" even though she was shot ... she was still able to call 911 for herself and @entity135			0
" @entity67 's car was discovered friday in a fast - food parking lot in @entity18			2
neighbor @entity138 said she noticed the car was parked in the lot for about a week and a half , but " i never smelled an odor coming from it			0
" but one passer - by did notice something suspicious and called police , who found a decomposed body of a young man in the trunk			1
the engaged couple were together for about seven years and met in @entity151 , @entity152 , where @entity59 's family lives			1
@entity59 then moved to @entity0 at her fiance 's invitation , @entity76 said			1
" they were a great family , " @entity76 said of the couple and the brother			0
