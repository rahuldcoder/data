-- he was barely a teenager , while on the other side of the net stood his country 's most famous face			2
a towering figure who had won @entity8 just one year earlier			1
despite the pressure , budding tennis star @entity9 handled both his nerves and his racquet well enough to impress @entity13			2
" it was an extremely huge experience for me , " @entity9 , now 26 , told @entity0 of his date with destiny in the @entity17 capital @entity18			1
" he had been my idol , like for most of the kids in @entity17			2
he 'd just won @entity8 and there i was -- a 14 - year - old kid playing tennis with him			1
" it was a dream come true			0
" it was an experience that also launched @entity9 's career			1
@entity13 was so struck by the youngster 's potential he recommended that his old coach , @entity30 , oversee his development			2
the @entity32 duly did so and shortly after , @entity9 served a more formal notice of his talents when winning the @entity37 boys ' title in 2005 -- beating top seed @entity38 in the semifinals			2
the pair would work together until may 2013 , separating just weeks before the former would learn he had failed a doping test in april			1
that seismic news was broken to the big server in june , prompting @entity9 to immediately quit the ongoing @entity8 championships , albeit citing a knee injury as he did so			1
as he awaited the fallout for what he has always claimed was an innocent mistake -- saying he inadvertently ingested a banned substance while in @entity51 , as he did n't realize that his regular glucose tablets were manufactured differently there -- @entity9 turned to his boyhood hero			2
" it was the obvious decision , " he says			0
" @entity13 was around me and my team before , and he was a close friend			0
when i stopped with @entity30 , @entity13 and i talked about whether he could help me or not			0
he felt i could improve a lot			0
" he was spot on			0
despite previously stating he has three personalities -- ' @entity13 ' , ' @entity59 ' and ' @entity60 ' for when things go wrong -- @entity13 's expertise has resulted in @entity9 's most successful season			1
he has improved his @entity64 © 's serve and mental strength , and @entity9 credits him with the sense of enjoyment he is largely having on court			1
@entity69 yet they came together at a time when @entity9 's career was looking as checkered as @entity17 's famous red - and - white flag			1
he was serving his nine - month doping ban , an act that often proves toxic for fans , media and sponsors , yet the duo were able to start to wrestle back credibility when the suspension was cut on appeal in october 2013			1
by then , @entity9 's ranking had dropped from 12th to 47th			1
exactly one year later , @entity9 had achieved his highest ever rating -- number 8 -- and also had a grand slam success to look back on			1
in september , he beat @entity88 's @entity87 to win the @entity89 , a success made all the sweeter by not losing a single set in the final , semifinal -- when he trounced @entity93 -- or the quarterfinal against @entity95			1
his combination with @entity13 has been alchemical at times			0
" @entity102 , " the 6ft 6in right - hander replies simply to the question as to what is the biggest thing the colorful @entity100 has given his compatriot			2
. " i think i am capable of making it to the top and being able to win big events			2
" by a quirk of serendipity , @entity9 also feels the four months he was out of the game in 2013 contributed to his fantastic 2014 , which delivered four titles -- double his previous best for any season			1
" those four months were very tough , it was a difficult time but i learned a lot of things , " explained the world no. 9			2
" i matured as a person and i became more specific with the priorities in my life and what i wanted to achieve in my career			0
" i feel i pushed myself much more this year and i was a little bit more motivated -- that always gives you a bit extra and when you are at the top of tennis , even 1 % makes a big difference			2
" i feel that the things i did last year , where i was working and preparing for the season , helped me to achieve what i achieved this year			0
" when i started this season , i felt really good -- maybe the best ever			0
" while his period in the wilderness helped recharge his batteries and contributed to his memorable year , the extent of his success may also have led to his only real blemish for 2014			1
last week , @entity9 made his debut at the season - ending @entity140 but he struggled in @entity141 , losing all his matches in a challenging group involving eventual champion @entity144 , @entity95 and @entity145			1
" it 's a little bit disappointing to play like this			0
i was not expecting it , " he said after winning just six games in his opening two matches			0
" but i feel a little bit tired , and the body feels a little bit tired on the court			0
" tears of @entity155 his fatigued body may receive a timely boost next week if a long - awaited parcel from @entity159 pitches up in the post			0
it will revive memories of a month when he played the ' greatest tennis ' of his life , even if he says he 's watched a dvd of the @entity167 final at least 10 times already			0
" " the replica trophy still has n't come , believe it or not			0
it 's still being made in @entity159 so hopefully it will arrive next week , " he said			0
" it 's going to be at my apartment in @entity18 and i 'm going to have to polish it -- every day ! " his @entity89 triumph made @entity9 one of only three men outside the @entity179 to have won a grand slam since 2005 , with @entity182 's @entity181 and @entity183 's @entity145 being the others			1
like the man he befriended as a 14 - year - old , @entity9 's success has also turned him into a standout star in his homeland			1
" i did n't think it was going to mean that much but when i came back , i realized the extent of its effect on people , " said the man nicknamed ' @entity9 ' by his friends			1
" it was one of the best moments of @entity17 sports ever but i did n't think it was going to change people 's lives for that week or month -- because everybody i saw was extremely happy			1
" they were unbelievably proud and whoever i saw on the street was congratulating me			0
that was the satisfaction for me that i could -- with my job and this achievement -- make people so happy			0
" on the day itself , even his boyhood idol shed a tear .			0
