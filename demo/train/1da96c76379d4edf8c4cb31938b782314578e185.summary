-- the @entity3 woman who was rescued after being stranded and alone for 49 days in a @entity5 wilderness left behind handwritten notes about her ordeal , officials said monday			1
the notes were found in the van where @entity9 was found on friday , said @entity12 ( @entity11 ) sheriff @entity10			1
the van was in remote territory near where @entity15 , @entity11 and @entity5 meet			1
stuck " is the way one note begins			1
the call for help has a date written below it that simply reads " since mar 19/11			0
" according to officials , the date marks the last time anyone had seen @entity9 or her husband			1
the next line continues with " no food			1
( battery ) lost my way ! " then the writing gets smaller as the space on the paper begins to run out , the note now reads , " @entity36 went to get help			0
did not return ! " and finally , the last words on the page written in red read , " maybe died along the way ? " written in smaller spaces on the paper in a different ink is the couple 's name , where they are from , and their phone number			1
the note also gives name and number of the couple 's son , and the date the couple is expected back in home			1
a second note starts with detailed gps readings on it , and then outlines the couples inability to get cell service in the rugged mountainous area			1
scribbled on the side of the second note is a message that started " we 're headed to @entity67 " and ended " got lost			1
" pictures of these notes were taken by the @entity70 amid the weekend search for @entity72 , who remained missing three days after his wife 's rescue			1
he left his wife to get help three days after their minivan got stranded off - road in the cold , untamed wilderness			1
that left @entity9 alone without much beyond some hard candy , a bag of trail mix , some books and the clothes she 'd packed for her trip to @entity67			1
plus , according to her son @entity89 , she always had faith			2
scores of men and women had searched for the @entity94 since the @entity95 , @entity96 , residents were last seen march 19 leaving a @entity99 gas station convenience store in @entity100 , @entity15			2
on friday , more than a month later , hunters wandered into the area where the van was sitting			2
@entity9 shot up from her spot in the 2000 @entity106 's backseat when she heard them outside , mustered her lingering strength to open the door and step out shoeless			1
three days later , she was in fair condition , resting comfortably in an @entity11 hospital , spending time with her children			0
" right now , we 're just celebrating , " said her son , @entity114 , on sunday , @entity115			1
even the doctor who oversaw @entity9 's care at @entity120 's @entity119 in @entity121 , @entity11 , acknowledged it was not easy to explain how a 56 - year - old woman could have such a positive prognosis and demeanor given what she 'd gone through			1
" in this case , for a person with suboptimal nutrition to survive so long -- let 's just say that it is understandable to call it a miracle , " dr. @entity127 told reporters sunday			2
while rainy and overcast weather forced authorities to call off the first day 's air search for @entity72 , cpl. @entity139 of the @entity140 said saturday that a search dog and about 20 people , riding six to eight all - terrain and four - wheel drive vehicles were on the case			1
a k - 9 unit was also brought in by the @entity70 to help search for the missing man on saturday			2
@entity149 and her dog @entity151 covered about four miles in each direction looking for any sign of @entity9			1
but after the daylight started to fade and weather took a turn for the worse , search efforts came to halt			2
@entity149 said she was shocked that @entity9 was able to survive the cold , mountainous region alone , and she wished her husband had remained at her side			1
" people keep going , " @entity149 said as she recounted her efforts to locate @entity72 , " they do n't turn - around			0
" but by backtracking the @entity164 may have found their way back to a road , she said			0
he said the couple 's van was found five to eight miles from a ranch where they could have gotten help			2
pictures released by the sheriff 's department show the van in a extremely remote area with no visible roads			1
the van was stuck in caked mud , , a shovel pictured near the back of the van , indicating that someone had been trying to free the vehicle from the mud			2
while the odds are dwindling that @entity72 will be found alive , authorities certainly are not ruling it out , said the police spokesman			0
" neither family nor investigators would have thought that we 'd be reporting , after seven weeks , of actually finding somebody alive , " @entity139 said			0
" until we know exactly what happened to @entity36 , it remains a mystery			0
" @entity9 and @entity72 's stop in @entity100 was recorded on the store 's surveillance tape			1
they were en route to a trade show convention in @entity67			0
but they later turned off the highway onto a forest service road that led into @entity5 , intending to enjoy the " scenic route , " said her son , who 'd heard the full story from his ailing mother			2
the couple took some wrong turns and had thought , based on their map , that their road was better than it was			0
then , about 20 miles from the highway , " apparently the road conditions ... degraded quite drastically , " said @entity139 , the police spokesman			0
by the time darkness fell , the minivan had succumbed to the combination of snow and mud , and was unable to move			2
on march 22 , @entity72 left the van , setting off to get help			1
his wife , who @entity89 said is " not an outdoorsy type of person , " remained behind			0
@entity9 rationed the little food available -- a beef jerky , some trail mix , fish oil pills , and one piece of hard candy per day			1
she 'd go outside for a walk once a day , using the sunlight to melt snow for drinking water and going to a nearby stream			2
in the meantime , she had plenty of time to read a few books ( some several times ) and the @entity245 , and record her thoughts in a journal			0
" she did it because she did n't know the outcome of this , " her son said , adding that he had not yet read the journal			2
" it was intended to sort of tell the story what happened over ( those ) days			0
" all the while , @entity9 got weaker , losing 20 to 30 pounds , according to @entity139			1
her son said that , in her last few days in the wild , she 'd come to peace with the sense that her time was dwindling			2
she penciled may 6 as a critical day in her mind : -- either she 'd be rescued or she 'd die			0
" she definitely had hope			0
but of course , just like us , every day goes by , you start preparing yourself for both options , " her son said			0
" so she was prepared for either			0
" after her discovery , @entity9 was airlifted to the @entity11 hospital			1
there , doctors worked first to address her starvation and dehydration , then to build up her ability to eat meals again and gain strength			0
by sunday , @entity127 said he still had n't seen her walk , but he said there were no indications of long - term problems and her prognosis was good			0
her spirits and evident desire to live , the doctor said , were even better			0
" it is unusual for us to see someone in this type of situation to actually not only survive , but to be doing so well at this time , " @entity127 said			0
" she obviously had the mindset of survival , and that must have been something that helped her go as long as she did			0
" for her son , the best thing was how little his mother had changed after her ordeal			1
she laughed just the same , and was just as warm , genuine and caring as she 'd always been , he said			0
" i would have hardly known anything had happened to her , " he said			0
" it was just beyond belief			0
" @entity0 's @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 contributed to this report .			0
