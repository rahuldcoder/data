we have other avenues , and our finances are not going to stop just because of oil losses , " the 28 - year - old militant said			1

but thank @entity37 , they do n't know anything			2
and @entity37 willing , we will defeat the infidels			2
" @entity13 said he was among the @entity3 fighters who took over @entity41 , @entity42 's second - largest city , in june			1

" they hit us in some areas , and we advance in others , " @entity13 said			0

these strikes can not stop us , our support or our fighters			1
" @entity0 president @entity56 admitted the quick rise of @entity3 in @entity4 had been underrestimated at first			1

" the 29 - year - old said he believed in @entity3 ' goal of creating an @entity47 state and left his wife and 3 - year - old son behind to go fight			1

but eventually , the brutally became too much for him			0

" if they had , it would n't be like this			0
" when the @entity0 and @entity118 partners started pounding the @entity3 stronghold of @entity120 last week , many militants scattered			2
