-- the city of @entity2 will pay $ 1.5 million to the family of a man who was fatally shot by a police officer last year			1
a @entity2 police officer shot and killed @entity7 , described as belonging to a @entity8 , on august 30			2
@entity7 , a woodcarver , was seen on video crossing a street holding his carving knife			1
when he did n't drop it , the officer shot him			1
the @entity14 said it was unclear whether @entity7 , who was partially deaf , heard the order			1
the @entity17 ruled the shooting unjustified			0
the officer , @entity19 , resigned			2
last month , the @entity20 launched a federal investigation of the police department for possible excessive use of force and discriminatory policing			1
although the @entity17 has been plagued by several reports of improper arrests and unwarranted beatings that led to a preliminary review , federal officials insisted the probe was not triggered by any specific incidents or allegations			1
assistant attorney general for @entity36 @entity35 and the @entity38 attorney in @entity2 , @entity39 , emphasized the investigation is civil , not criminal			0
they said rather than seeking to resolve any specific cases , the " pattern or practice " investigation will focus on @entity2 police systems of enforcement and on policy changes that may need to be made			0
@entity35 said the probe will be much narrower than a similar investigation of the @entity51 , but noted @entity2 and @entity52 have both fully cooperated with federal authorities			1
the officials stressed that neither the federal preliminary review nor the full " pattern or practice " investigation announced thursday had been triggered by a letter from the @entity14 and more than 30 civil rights groups calling for a full - blown investigation			1
@entity35 said the preliminary review had started when the @entity20 received the letter in early december			2
in addition to the fatal shooting of @entity7 , that letter cited five alleged incidents of particular concern that the @entity14 claims require a wide - ranging investigation : -- june 11 2009 : an @entity72 man being released from jail was tackled , kicked in the face and beaten with a baton by three officers , according to the @entity14 letter			1
-- april 17 , 2010 : police stopped a @entity80 man they believed might be a robbery suspect			0
video shows that while the man was lying on the sidewalk , an officer kicked him in the face and threatened to beat him			2
another officer then stepped on his legs , the letter says			0
-- april 24 , 2010 : one of the same officers involved in that incident arrested a young man after a bar fight			0
the man was handcuffed , placed in the back of a patrol car , where , he claims , the officer repeatedly choked him , the civil rights groups allege			2
-- june 14 , 2010 : a police officer saw young people jaywalking and confronted a teenage african - american girl			0
the letter says video of the incident shows that after she put her hands on him , the officer punched the girl in the face			0
-- october 18 , 2010 : a convenience store camera shows an @entity72 teenager with his hands in the air being kicked by a police officer , causing him to fall to the ground			0
after he was kicked several more times , the teenager was handcuffed by a second officer , according to the letter .			0
