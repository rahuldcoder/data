-- most outrageous fish tales begin with an arching arm gesture and " a fish this big " -- but this one starts with " fish that traveled this far			0
" just over two years after the @entity10 earthquake and tsunami , researchers made a startling discovery in a 20 - foot - long @entity10 fishing vessel that washed ashore last month near @entity14 , @entity15 : five tropical fish , alive and well			1
they are called striped beakfish , and they are native to warmer waters near @entity10 , @entity19 and the @entity20			1
the five stowaways , roughly the size of your palm , lived in a cozy spot at the back of the boat			1
a 20 - to 30 - gallon containment hold in the boat 's stern lost its cover , and that part of the boat was submerged as the vessel drifted in the ocean , said @entity35 , a scientist with the @entity15 @entity36			1
that " created like a cave they could go in and out of , " @entity35 said			0
@entity10 tsunami debris makes its way into @entity43 birds @entity35 said most debris out in the ocean attracts fish , so it 's not surprising these fish found a home in the debris			1
but it is surprising they survived the nearly 5,000 - mile journey			1
" it 's very rare that you 'd see something like this , " @entity35 said			1
" obviously , fish are very robust and we are learning this on all of the species that come across			0
" when researchers first explored the boat , they saw just one of the fish in the holding tank			1
they collected it in a bucket and took it to @entity70			0
someone at @entity70 called the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , to come and get it			0
@entity77 personnel found three more in the tank 's murky water			2
finally the boat was towed to a state yard , where the fifth fish came swimming up to @entity83			2
the one that went to the aquarium will live out its life there			2
general manager @entity90 says it 'll go on display saturday			2
" he is a pretty cool fish , and i just wonder if there are more out there , " he said			0
the other four had the honor of contributing to research at @entity98 , where researchers will dissect them learn their ages and what they 've been eating			0
sea anemones , scallops , crabs , worms and sea cucumbers that hitched a ride on the same boat also will be studied			0
massive dock washes ashore on national park beach			0
