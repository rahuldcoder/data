@entity0 -- two good samaritans returned more than $ 275,000 that tumbled out of an improperly secured armored truck in @entity4 , @entity0 , last week			1

a @entity15 armored truck inadvertently strewed more than a dozen bags of money on the ground in front of the @entity13 on friday , according to sgt. @entity20 of the @entity4 police department			1
the bags slipped out of an open door on the side of the truck			1
apparently oblivious , the driver proceeded to his intended destination , a @entity15 facility a few blocks away			1
@entity30 , the owner of the antiques shop , and @entity33 , who had just gotten a haircut at a nearby barbershop , cuttin up , were the first to approach the bags			2
@entity33 said at first he thought the bags merely contained garbage			2
only when he began to inspect one did he realize , " oh man , this is money			2
" the money was in all different denominations , from coins to $ 100 bills			1
the two men then began to round up the bags and load them into plastic postal bins			2
@entity48 , an off - duty @entity4 police officer who happened to be browsing in @entity30 ' antiques shop , assisted them			0
as word spread that hundreds of thousands of dollars lay in the street , people streamed out of passing cars and adjacent businesses			0
for the most part the gatherers cooperated in the recovery effort			0
herring attributed the crowd 's willingness to turn over the money -- rather than run away with it -- to his imposing stature			0
" had i not been the size i was , it might have went a different way			0
" one man did display some reluctance to part with the bag he found			0
but @entity33 said that with a few words , he was able to persuade the man to release his grip on it			0
all told , the men recovered $ 276,160 divided among 14 bags			2
but two bags containing some $ 60,000 are still missing			1
police said it remains unclear whether the missing bags fell from the truck at an earlier point along its route , or whether someone at the scene of the main spill managed to discreetly slip away with them			1
@entity20 noted that it is grand larceny , a felony , to keep a sack of money one chances upon			0
" we tip our hats to the people who did the right thing , " he said			0
as for the @entity15 , @entity33 said it rewarded him with a t - shirt and a gold coin commemorating the company 's 150th anniversary			1
brinks did not return calls for comment .			0
