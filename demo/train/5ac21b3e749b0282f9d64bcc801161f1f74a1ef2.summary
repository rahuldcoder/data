@entity0 -- it 's sunday morning and i 'm standing in front of a newsagent 's shop , waiting for the stranger who lives above it to let me into his home			2
i 'm one of thousands taking advantage of @entity12 's all - access invitation to tour @entity0 's most prolific and innovative buildings , including private residences the public would never have access to otherwise , from the prime minister 's historical abode to the recently renovated townhouse i 've come to see			1
since its inception in 1992 , the concept has spread to 24 cities -- including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- but the @entity0 event , which takes place over one weekend each september , remains the largest , with 800 properties participating this year			1
though @entity12 's mission is to foster an appreciation for architecture and urban design , those opening their doors to the public also provides an opportunity for the city 's designers and homeowners to show off their work			1
how the other half lives there 's a queue outside of painter @entity46 's modernist home in wealthy @entity48 village ( a short walk from the home of @entity51 , the father of modernist architecture in @entity53 ) when i arrive			1
the grey , angular house , designed by the award - winning guard @entity57 , is the only one on its block of simple brown @entity60 participating in @entity12 this year			1
" i think it 's a tribute to architecture , " she says of her home , which was shortlisted for a @entity64 award in 2012			1
" i believe that my house is interesting , and obviously many people do			2
" @entity69 is like an industrial gallery space , all cement and glass , with guests leaning in to examine @entity46 's impressive collection of furniture including vintage chairs by @entity77 ) and ornaments , like a @entity80 vase that 's over 700 years old			1
there are as many marveling at the fortress - like wall around the garden as there are around each expensive art piece			0
@entity12 is as much a way to experience an inaccessible lifestyle as it is a chance to look at inaccessible architecture			1
from a family of architects herself , @entity46 feels as though it 's her duty to let others experience her home and its wonders , though it may be a bit pricey to emulate directly			1
" hopefully people enjoy it and find inspiration for their own homes , or open their views on other things related to architecture			0
" the business of inside access letting in the public can also benefit the firms behind these fantastic homes			2
@entity111 , principal architect at @entity112 , has been asked to show 18 properties with @entity12 over the last 11 years , and is always grateful to be recognized			1
" for me , it 's like being in a @entity116 exhibition , " he says			0
@entity117 , a west @entity118 he redid in his studio 's minimalist style ( think wood , geometry , and expansive windows ) , is run like a realtor 's showing			0
visitors are asked to remove their shoes at the door , and there are finger sandwiches on offer in the kitchen			0
@entity111 presents a slideshow about the property every thirty minutes			0
" we get most of our businesses from @entity12 , " he tells me between presentations			2
" sometimes i have people say ' @entity111 , we 've been following you for three years			0
now we 've got some money and we 'd like you to be our architect			0
' " in fact , the owners of this particular home first met @entity111 at at @entity12 four years ago			2
they were so impressed that when they bought a house in 2012 , they turned to him to transform their traditional home into a contemporary retreat			0
but even if they do n't bring new business , @entity111 is always receptive to feedback from those outside the design world			0
" when you get little old ladies saying ' i did n't really think i liked modern architecture , but this is amazing , ' it 's great			2
" what we can learn from the tattoos of our ancestors @entity164 : the life , death and rebirth of a @entity0 icon one hundred years since the ' @entity169 ' of posters began the strange world of toilet architecture			0

@entity12 gives visitors access to the city 's most interesting buildings
the goal is to foster an appreciation for architecture and urban design
the event allows proud homeowners to share their space with the public , and can connect architects with new clients
this year , 800 properties were featured in the weekend event
