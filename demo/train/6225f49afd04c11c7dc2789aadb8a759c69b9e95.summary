[ breaking news update , posted at 11:50 p.m. et ] a @entity3 source tells @entity0 that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 to 180 people ready to strike in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and the @entity10			1
the source said that @entity13 and @entity14 intelligence agencies identified an " imminent threat " to @entity9 , possibly also to the @entity10			1
[ previous story , posted at 8 p.m. et ] @entity9 operation thwarted ' major terrorist attacks ' ( @entity0 ) -- a terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack was the target of a raid thursday that left two suspects dead , @entity9 authorities said			1
a third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation at a building in the eastern city of @entity33 , prosecutor 's spokesman @entity26 told reporters			1
a senior @entity9 counterterrorism official told @entity0 that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from @entity38			1
some members of the cell had traveled to @entity42 and met with @entity38 , which plotted the attacks as retaliation for @entity46 - led airstrikes in @entity42 and @entity47 , the @entity9 source said			1
" this was in the framework of an operation looking into an operational cell made up of people , some of whom coming back from @entity42 , " @entity26 said			1
" the investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in @entity9 imminently			1
" the operation , which authorities said was ongoing , added fresh fuel to a fear that 's been simmering for months as thousands of @entity62 went off to join @entity38 fighters in @entity42			2
would they bring the war back with them when they returned home ? @entity69 was inside his house in @entity33 when he heard the explosions start			2
from the window , he saw police officers firing assault rifles at a house nearby			2
he watched smoke rising after another explosion went off			2
then , police entered the house , @entity69 told @entity0 's " @entity79			0
" and even though he could n't see exactly what happened next , he heard it			2
" i can hear it			0
everybody can hear it , " @entity69 said			0
" in this little city , everybody heard the sound			1
" shouts , gunfire and the sound of glass shattering echo in a video @entity69 posted on @entity93			2
" the suspects immediately , and for long minutes , fired using weapons and hand weapons before being neutralized , " @entity26 said			0
@entity33 is about 69 miles ( 111 kilometers ) east - southeast of @entity97 and 200 miles ( 322 kilometers ) northeast of @entity98 , where terrorist attacks last week heightened alerts in @entity62			2
@entity0 affiliate @entity101 reported that the terrorism investigation in @entity9 started weeks ago , and there has been no connection established with the @entity98 attacks			1
a @entity107 intelligence source said the @entity98 attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the @entity9 operation			1
one reason : the arrest of a @entity9 arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to @entity115 , the man who attacked a @entity98 kosher supermarket and also pledged allegiance to @entity38			1
@entity9 investigators questioned him and searched his possessions , the source said			1
through the arms dealer , the investigators got a number of " positive hits " on suspected extremists already known to authorities			0
but in the wake of the @entity98 attacks , the source said , it stepped up the urgency			0
the trio targeted in the @entity33 raid had been under surveillance for some time , @entity26 said			0
additional anti-terrorism operations are underway in other cities , the @entity9 counterterrorism official said			1
in recent weeks , @entity62 security services received indications of an ominous possibility : that @entity38 may have started directing @entity62 extremists in @entity42 and @entity47 to launch terrorist attacks back in their home countries , the @entity9 counterterrorism official said			1
security agencies in several @entity62 countries were intensely investigating several groups of returnees from @entity42 and @entity47 , the official said , including the group that authorities confronted in @entity9			1
the @entity9 counterterrorism official said indications of @entity38 ordering attacks in @entity62 mark an apparent significant shift by the terrorist group			1
before the air campaign against it , the official said , there was little indication @entity38 leaders were directly plotting attacks in the @entity160			2
instead , the group prioritized its project to create an @entity164 caliphate			0
the official named @entity7 , the @entity166 and @entity9 as countries facing a particular threat			1
counterterrorism agencies in @entity8 also are on high alert because of the number of fighters who have traveled			0
several @entity62 countries , including @entity166 , @entity7 , @entity9 and the @entity10 are participating in the air campaign against @entity38 in @entity47			1
why would @entity38 change tack ? partly because of increased competition between @entity38 and @entity178 affiliates , including the @entity179 in @entity42 , to be seen as the standard bearers of global jihad , according to the official			0
the official said there is also significant concern about @entity187 attack plotting against @entity62			1
@entity46 officials previously told @entity0 that @entity7 @entity178 operative and bomb - maker @entity189 was suspected to be talent - spotting @entity62 jihadis in @entity42 for operations in @entity62			2
@entity189 was injured in a drone strike in november but is believed to be still alive			0
last week , @entity194 , the head of @entity166 's security service @entity195 , warned , " a group of core @entity178 terrorists in @entity42 is planning mass casualty attacks against the @entity160 , " an apparent reference to the @entity179			0
@entity62 officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by returning fighters			2
more than 3,000 @entity62 have left to fight in @entity42 in recent years			0
the total number who have returned to @entity62 is estimated to be over 500 , including 250 who have returned to the @entity166 , almost 200 to @entity7 and about 70 to @entity9			1
several returning @entity38 fighters have already been implicated in attack plans in @entity62			2
in february , police in @entity210 broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in @entity7 by @entity213 , a @entity7 - @entity215 extremist who allegedly had just returned from fighting with @entity38 in @entity42			0
police said they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive tatp inside soda cans in his family 's @entity210 apartment building			0
screws and nails were attached to one with sticky tape as shrapnel , according to sources briefed on the investigation			0
@entity213 has denied the allegations against him			0
@entity230 , a @entity7 - @entity215 @entity38 fighter who allegedly helped guard @entity107 hostages in @entity42 before returning to @entity62 , allegedly shot and killed four people at a @entity234 museum in @entity97 in may			0
@entity230 was arrested in @entity7 and extradited to face trial in @entity9			1
he has denied the charges			0
in both the @entity210 and @entity97 plots , investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam			0
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting @entity38 leadership signed off on the plots			0
but the worry now is that @entity38 has pivoted toward launching attacks in @entity62			0
@entity62 officials say all this adds up to an unprecedented terrorist threat in @entity62			1
late last year , just weeks before the attacks on a satirical magazine , @entity234 grocery and police officers in @entity98 , @entity7 prime minister @entity250 said @entity7 had never faced a greater terrorist threat			2
@entity38 runs large training facilities in @entity42 , has deep financial pockets , and access to thousands of potential @entity62 recruits			0
@entity0 's @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .			0
