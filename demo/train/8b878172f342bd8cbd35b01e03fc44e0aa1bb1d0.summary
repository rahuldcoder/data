editor 's note : @entity3 's @entity2 writes about his maniacal love for @entity6 basketball			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 play in the @entity11 this weekend			1
@entity2 says the @entity6 team can help heal the city 's old wounds			1
@entity3 's @entity2 , left , says he 's been hooked on @entity6 basketball since he was a kid			1
@entity15 , @entity16 ( @entity3 ) -- my love for @entity6 basketball is completely irrational			1
i never went to school there and have no affiliation with the university			2
but i bleed @entity24 blue			2
my dad used to take my brothers and me to @entity6 games as a kid , and i 've been hooked ever since			1
we once bought tickets from a scalper for six bucks apiece against arch - rival the @entity33 in the 1980s			2
my dad complained we paid too much			2
but then we moved in seventh grade			2
i became an even bigger fan after we left the city			2
i 'd huddle over my @entity37 , hooked up with a coat hanger wrapped in aluminum foil as an antenna			0
more than 350 miles away , i managed to pick up the then - @entity6 games through the crackle and static of the radio			1
@entity6 basketball was my only way to remain connected to my youth and the city that i loved			1
that was 1985 , the last time @entity6 made the @entity11			1
is your team in the @entity11 ? send your @entity52 celebratory photos back then , @entity6 was led by a phenom named @entity54			1
he was best known for a sweet baseline jumper as soft as the nylon nets he swished			0
he was also known for his giant afro			0
he was listed as 6 feet 10 inches			0
the joke was if you included his wild hairdo , he was 7 - 4			0
when my parents were away at work , sometimes i 'd sneak into my mom 's cabinet , steal her mousse and then put it in my hair			0
then this white kid would go out back and shoot hoops for hours , hair sticking straight out like i stuck my finger in a socket			0
it was the only way i could be like @entity54 , my hero and idol			0
back then , @entity78 would rank @entity54 right up there with @entity80 as the city 's most popular icons			0
and that 's the thing about @entity24 basketball			2
in a place where race has often divided so much of it , @entity6 basketball has helped unite the city			1
as a boy , white and black kids would crowd the basketball court at @entity24 games to try to snatch the players ' sweatbands as they raced into the locker room			1
up until i graduated from high school , the sweatbands of @entity98 and @entity99 sat on my shelf in my room			0
like a fan of any team , there have been good and bad times over the years			2
but sometimes the pain of being a @entity24 fan is that much greater			2
tragedy and heartbreak are part of it , such as when @entity99 killed his girlfriend and then himself in 1997			0
other players , such as @entity115 and @entity116 , have died far too young along the way , furthering the pain of being a fan			2
@entity119 -- who as a black player brought together the city and took @entity6 to its only national championship game in 1973 , and later became one of its greatest coaches -- has lived much of the past few years in a rehabilitation center after suffering severe strokes			1
in some ways , that 's what makes @entity6 basketball so special			1
@entity6 players embody the real life of so many @entity134 , many faced with extreme hard times			1
some succeed ; some do n't			0
others , such as @entity139 , keep on fighting			0
i do n't find it an accident that @entity6 is now seeking history the same week of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the rev. @entity148 " i think dr. @entity148 would find this a source of joy , " the rev. @entity141 told the team this week , according to the @entity154 newspaper			1
a city that has seen so much pain , so much heartache , has something huge to celebrate -- all revolving around young college kids and a bouncy orange ball			0
the adage is that sports often have the ability to transcend the moment			0
this is one of those times			0
to get to the championship game monday night , @entity6 must first get past @entity9 , the same team that defeated it in that 1973 title game			1
while much of the rest of the nation has the team pegged to lose , the @entity24 -- for one shining moment -- have a chance to do something really special			1
they 'd have it no other way			0
as for me ? i wo n't be listening on my old radio , but this weekend i might just try sporting that ' do like @entity54			0
