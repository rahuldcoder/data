the heavily armed militants stormed the girls dormitory in the middle of the night , herding more than 200 students on to vehicles and burning down nearby buildings as they made their escape			2
that was a week ago monday			0
of the 230 students abducted from the @entity10 in the @entity12 town of @entity13 , about 190 are still missing , one official said			1
the number of girls taken from the school has been revised by officials several times , and on monday , @entity19 spoke with principal @entity20 , who said a new figure of at least 230 was determined after reviewing records and taking reports from parents			1
@entity25 , a spokesman for the @entity28 provincial governor 's office , put the number at 234 -- 129 science students and 105 art students			2
he said in a written statement that the confusion resulted because the art students did n't leave campus as expected on the day of the attack			0
the head of the dormitory initially did n't count them among the missing			0
no one knows where the missing girls are			2
and even more surprising , no one 's particularly shocked			0
" all the community are sympathizing with the parents , " @entity20 told @entity19 earlier			0
but , she said , " the people in the villages are not surprised			0
" such is life in the lawless @entity28 province			0
tucked away near the border with @entity53 , with phone services cut off and travel strongly discouraged , this poor corner of @entity12 is no stranger to such brazen , violent acts			1
for 11 months , the provinces of @entity28 , @entity58 and @entity59 have been under a state of emergency due to relentless assaults blamed on @entity62			1
the @entity64 militant group has bombed churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders			2
@entity62 -- whose name means " @entity74 education is sin " in the local @entity77 language -- says it wants to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity80 law across @entity82 's most populous nation			1
the group has gone about its misguided mission with such depressing regularity that residents have become somewhat numb			0
where 's the president ? @entity12 marvel that @entity90 president @entity89 traveled to @entity91 after the @entity93 bombings that killed three people last year			1
@entity62 - related violence killed 1,500 in the first three months of this year alone			1
and yet , @entity12 president @entity96 has not visited the region recently			1
part of it may have to do with geographic divisions			0
@entity96 is from the predominantly @entity102 south			0
that 's not just geographically distant but also culturally different from the @entity105 - dominated , violence - wracked north			1
to put things in perspective , none of @entity96 's major political rivals from the north attended his inauguration in 2011			0
and widespread violence broke out in the north when his presidential win was announced , with some residents claiming the election was rigged			2
it 's the opposite of what happened with @entity96 's predecessor			0
the previous president , @entity119 , was from the north			0
during his tenure , violence ravaged the country 's oil - rich , southern @entity122 , with militant groups saying they wanted a fairer distribution of the region 's oil wealth			1
where 's the military ? the @entity12 military has been engaged in a brutal , ever - escalating fight with @entity62			1
rights group accuse both sides of ruthlessness -- @entity62 of indiscriminate attacks , and the military of extrajudicial killings			1
but when it comes to the abductions of girls -- and there have been many -- the military has had a difficult time			1
last week , the defense ministry erroneously reported that all but eight of the girls from the latest kidnapping were free			1
it retracted a day later			0
@entity150 , the father of one of the students , said the government turned from using " blatant propaganda " to making a " blatant lie			0
" part of the reason the military is loath to respond mightily may be because the girls who are kidnapped are raped , forced into servitude -- but rarely killed			1
in february , 29 college students in the northern @entity58 province were killed after an attack authorities blamed on @entity62			1
all of them were males			0
in other instances , kidnapped girls were later rescued while working on farms			2
many were pregnant or had babies -- the result of rape			0
the spate of kidnappings began in may 2013 when @entity62 leader @entity176 announced in a video that this was part of its latest bloody campaign			1
the kidnappings , he said , were retaliation for @entity12 security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members			2
those kidnapped , he said , would begin a new life as a " servant			2
" but the latest incident has ratcheted up the pressure on the military			1
the military said " ongoing , frantic efforts " of security forces , vigilante groups and hunters are attempting to find and free the students			2
but a week later , the fate of 190 girls remain unknown .			0

officials revise total number of girls kidnapped to at least 230
this poor corner of @entity12 is no stranger to such brazen , violent acts
@entity62 - related violence killed 1,500 in the first three months of 2014
the latest incident has ratcheted up pressure on the military
