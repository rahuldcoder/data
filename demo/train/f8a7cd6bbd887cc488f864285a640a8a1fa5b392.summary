-- here 's a little fact of life that took me by surprise : roughly 23 million women in this country are 40 to 49 years of age and about 6,000 of us turn 50 every single day			1
we are a thoroughly undefined constituency			1
some of us are what the wonderful @entity10 used to call " bachelor girls , " some of us are married , and a lot of us have had trial separations that seemed to go just fine ... at least for the husband ( with the struggling rock band ) , who went on to become the ex-husband ( with the thriving law practice )			2
many of us have demanding kids or aging parents or a little of each			2
we juggle jobs , mortgages , student loans , and cancer treatments with low - fat diets , low - impact aerobics , low - grade depressions , a strong sense of irony , a dark sense of humor , and a full - bodied cabernet			1
we are very tired -- we 've thought seriously about penciling in a nervous breakdown for ourselves , but we 've been through everything the world has to throw at us so many times that it 's damn near impossible to get nervous about much of anything			1
despite ( or perhaps because of ) all the coulda , woulda , shoulda moments that have come and gone , we 've learned how to have a good laugh , an impromptu party , and an impure thought ( or two ) on a semiregular basis			2
we consider our options , our alternatives , our exit strategies			2
we take notes , we plan ahead , but we always leave room for serendipity			2
we are an entire generation of women who are making up our lives as we go along			1
@entity0 : what @entity0 has learned though the years i know that it 's human nature to want to glorify the past and preserve it in a delicious , if often inaccurate , cotton - candied haze			1
but the truth is that part of me ( that would be the part of me that now needs an underwire bra and a pair of @entity64 ) really does miss my 20s			2
i still had that new car smell			1
i still thought terrorism would stay confined to the other side of the world			2
on the home front , i still kept standing up for brides ( as if they needed my assistance to stand ) while waiting politely for it to be my turn			2
and because it never occurred to me that my turn would n't come , i devoted an inordinate amount of time to trying to decide whether my wedding gown should be white or ecru -- by the time i hit 35 , i 'd have been okay with paisley			1
the @entity81 had not gone mainstream when i was in my 20s , so any surfing i did ( and coming from @entity84 , that was n't much ) was in the ocean			2
and i grant you , my rearview mirror might be a little bit rose - tinted , but if memory serves , those oceans were fairly clean			1
come to think of it , the glaciers were glacial , the bees were alive and well , a can of tuna did n't require a warning from the surgeon general , and the climate was n't making any sudden moves			0
color me crazy , but i 've always been a sucker for a nice solid layer of ozone parking itself between me and a death ray			0
i 'm also a great believer in time off for good behavior			0
i like being unreachable once in a while , and in those days it was no big deal if somebody could n't track you down for half an hour			1
you see , in the 1980s , we did n't know from e-mail or cell phones or @entity115 or gps , and a @entity117 was nothing more complicated than a healthy treat that was high in antioxidants -- only guess what ? nobody had ever heard of antioxidants			0
i did n't need a baby aspirin every night or a lipitor every morning			0
and i swear to @entity126 ( that 's another thing , @entity126 was still around when i was in my 20s ) , the closest anybody seemed to come to a genuine eating disorder was picking at a mixed green salad on a blind date until it was okay to go home and scarf down the contents of your refrigerator			0
but before i start turning into my great - uncle @entity138 , who never fails to tell me how he could 've bought the entire @entity139 of @entity140 for $ 225 back in 1936 ( " when an ear of corn still tasted like an ear of corn " ) , let me say this : as much as i miss those days , i 'm delighted and relieved to be done with being young			1
one quick glance in the mirror is all i need to know that time is most definitely a thief			0
wait , strike that : one glance and i usually think i 'm holding up pretty well -- it 's upon closer inspection , that moment when i take a deep breath , put on my glasses , and turn up the dimmer switch , that i 'm reminded gravity is not my friend			0
but if time has robbed me of a little elasticity and a lot of naïveté , it 's left a few things in their place			0
thanks to nearly 48 years at the big dance , a million mistakes , and one extraordinary psychiatrist , i 've finally achieved the occasional touch of clarity			1
i 'm getting to be resourceful			0
i 'm getting to be resilient , and i hope that on my better days , i 'm getting to be a little more calm , a little more contemplative , a little more compassionate			1
@entity0 : how to make your midlife matter sometimes i think being middle - aged is n't about learning a lot of new lessons so much as learning the same old ones again and again			1
here are a few of the lessons i keep learning : it is never a good thing when a shrinking portion of the population controls a growing portion of the money			0
it tends to make incredibly decent , hardworking , middle - class people sort of jumpy , and the next thing you know @entity189 is playing @entity190 in a @entity192 extravaganza			1
anyone who looks okay in ochre will look even better not in ochre			0
war and famine bad , @entity197 and spaghetti carbonara good			0
what does n't kill me does not make me stronger			0
it makes me anxious , bitchy , and vulnerable ... but nobody wants to see that embroidered on a pillow			0
this is n't exactly an old lesson i keep learning , but given that i 'm lucky enough to have my own column , i 'd like to use it to set right an unfortunate mistake			1
remember a few years ago when we all got together and decided that sleep was the new sex ? i 've come to believe that we were dead wrong			1
what do you say we make actual ouch - you 're - on - my - hair , did - you - hear - the - baby , jeez - that - was - my - eye , messy , intimate , life - affirming , really , really fun sex the new sex ? ! because here 's the thing : between the economy , the environment , and the powder keg that is @entity226 , nobody 's getting any sleep anyway -- so as long as we 're all lying there wide awake ... @entity232 was a genius			1
she wrote a gem of a poem called " @entity236			0
" it 's very short , but i 'm low on space , so i 'll just cut to the end : but now i know the things i know , and do the things i do ; and if you do not like me so , to hell , my love , with you ! @entity244 , ms. @entity232			0
and , finally , deep into my 40s , i could n't agree with you more			0

columnist @entity246 heads toward 50s with fond look back at younger years
back then , she still had her " new car smell " and could enjoy solitude
says women in her generation are tired , considering *scheduling* a breakdown
but since no one is sleeping these days , she 'd like life - affirming , really fun sex
