@entity0 was a @entity1 psychiatrist who spent three years during @entity2 living under unspeakable circumstances in several of the most notorious @entity5 concentration camps			1
while imprisoned , @entity0 realized he had one single freedom left : he had the power to determine his response to the horror unfolding around him			1
and so he chose to imagine			1
he imagined his wife and the prospect of seeing her again			1
he imagined himself teaching students after the war about the lessons he had learned			1
@entity0 survived and went on to chronicle his experiences and the wisdom he had drawn from them			1
" a human being is a deciding being , " he wrote in his 1946 book , " @entity20 , " which sold more than 10 million copies			1
" between stimulus and response there is a space			1
in that space is our power to choose our response			1
in our response lies our growth and our freedom			1
" the idea of becoming conscious of the subjectivity of our perceptions is an admittedly abstract one -- the stuff of philosophy and science fiction			1
but human perceptions , and their ramifications , are very real and potentially life - changing			1
for example , research shows that people may hold an unconscious bias against creativity because it represents uncertainty unless they are able to perceive that uncertainty in a positive light			1
and consider the role perception plays in helping patients improve in ailments ranging from pain and depression to @entity53 through a phenomenon known as the placebo effect			1
though the placebo effect remains largely shrouded in mystery , researchers attribute some aspects of the placebo response to active mechanisms in the brain that can influence bodily processes such as the immune response and release of hormones			1
studies also show that perceived risk can drive behavior change			1
the perception of the harmful effects of smoking , for example , can influence habit and addiction			1
so how might we harness the power of perception to live more conscious lives and , perhaps , to even recast the most dire situations in which we find ourselves ? the fiction of reality perception begins when the human brain receives data from the body 's five senses			1
the mind then processes and applies meaning to the sensory information			1
" i want to start with a game , " says neuroscientist and artist @entity90 at the outset of his @entity93 on perception			1
" to win this game , all you have to do is see the reality that 's in front of you as it really is			2
" as it turns out , seeing that reality is n't as easy as it sounds , even when it comes to basic shapes and colors			1
@entity106 uses a series of optical illusions involving light , color and space to show that even the most fundamental of our senses -- the way we perceive light and color -- can be subject to interpretation			1
the variable , says @entity106 , is context			2
the exact same image can have an infinite number of sources in the real world			2
when it comes to perception -- seeing , feeling , hearing , sensing things -- there is no such thing as objectivity			2
humans evolved to make sense of things			2
every time a stimulus comes to us , our brain does the efficient thing : it responds based on past experience			2
in so doing , the brain continually redefines normality			2
it is being shaped , literally , as a consequence of trial and error			2
" the brain did not evolve to see the world the way it really is -- we ca n't , " @entity90 says			2
" we ca n't help but to see things according to history -- our own history and that of our ancestors -- because we are defined by ecology			2
not by our biology , not by our dna , but by our history of interactions			2
" sensory information can mean just about anything , @entity106 observes			2
it 's what we do with that information that matters			2
when context distorts society gets inside of our heads and habits , says @entity168 , professor of sociology and african - american studies at @entity171			2
" it forms everything from our taste in food , our sensibilities , what we think is good , bad or evil			2
none of these beliefs occur in isolation			0
" this profound social influence , known as " habitus , " is acquired through activities and experiences of everyday life , and is often taken for granted			0
the concept hails as far back as @entity188			0
quite often relying unconsciously on habitus for context serves us well			0
take an infamous example of mistaken perception plucked from the news : so much of the encounter between @entity196 and @entity197 had to do with context and perceptions , @entity168 says			1
" think about the different ways in which a majority of @entity203 see the agency of black men , " she says			0
" in certain contexts , like on a court during @entity208 , we are perfectly comfortable celebrating these bodies			0
but take those same bodies and place them in a different context -- walking down the street in a predominantly white neighborhood -- and quickly that perception of black masculinity at the core of our culture changes context			0
and in this new context , being a black male may suddenly become a life and death issue			0
" and so we sometimes find ourselves at a crossroads , in a place of uncertainty , faced with perceptions borne of falsehood , misunderstanding , bias or disunity -- perceptions that do not serve us			1
echoing @entity0 , @entity106 says of those types of perceptions : " we are responding and not choosing			1
" the beginning of awareness according to @entity106 , the creation of all new perceptions begins in the same way , with a single question : " why ? " " why " is , in that sense , the most dangerous word in history , @entity106 observes			1
because as soon as you ask that question , you open up the possibility of change			0
so asking " why " may be the hardest thing for people to do			0
education must be about creating new perceptions , @entity106 says			1
traditionally education has been about efficiency -- it wants to know what happens at the end			0
there is a right answer			0
but people really need to learn to move between the " why " and the " how			0
" innovation and change are , at their very essence , a " why " proposition , says @entity261 , a psychologist and @entity263 management professor who studies creativity			0
the " how " comes later			0
it is in this way that perception often becomes the gateway to innovation and change			0
" people are so averse to uncertainty that they ca n't see creativity			0
they are blind to it , " @entity261 notes			0
but by becoming aware of our mind - sets and perceptions , we can step in the direction of breakthroughs			1
the power to choose a response there are practical ways to start on the path to growth and innovation			1
you must at the outset be certain that you want change , @entity261 says			0
" be clear strategically whether you really are looking for something groundbreaking			0
sometimes people call something innovation , but it really is n't			0
" @entity106 says that the underlying aim of his research is to help people transform by enabling them to understand and become part of learning about their own perceptions			1
" i hope people will walk away from my experiments , not with an understanding of color , but an understanding of themselves , or at least a question of themselves			0
" the first step , he says , is through awareness			0
" you must see yourself see			0
it 's about observation and curiosity , having a sense of wonder , becoming aware of the connection between the past and the present			0
becoming an observer of yourself enables you to do amazing things			0
" become aware of how your habitat forms your habits , " she says			0
what we are fighting for , @entity168 says , is our imagination -- the right to imagine a life and relationships and a social world that are happier , less anxious , more harmonious and more just			0
" we are not being diligent enough or deliberate enough about cultivating our imagination			0
we have to fight for our ability to imagine the world we want			0
because one form of oppression is telling people that they 're not allowed to imagine something better and happier			0
" " either there are no illusions or everything is an illusion , " said @entity90 at the conclusion of his remarks at the recent @entity345 conference			0
" and given that we are pretty much all delusional , you might as well choose your delusion			1

we have the power to choose our responses , @entity354 survivor @entity0 said
the power of our perceptions can be seen with the placebo effect during *clinical* trials
the way we perceive even the most basic of our senses is dependent on interpretation
