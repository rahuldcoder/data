-- @entity1 's waiting for me on a lone bench in the heat , just beyond her building 's shaded front entrance			1
she 's wearing denim capris and a lightweight cable - knit sweater that precisely matches the yellow patent leather moccasins on her feet			2
saucer - sized sunglasses block out her face , and her silvery hair is cut short and chic			0
i did n't want to meet @entity1 out here			1
at 86 , she 's declared herself done with sunscreen			2
could n't we meet at her room instead ? " it 's not a room , " she snapped			2
this is n't a nursing home			0
" more specifically , it 's the senior living residence she 's come to rule			1
@entity27 dominance is n't something i ever expected from my grandmother			2
except when spending time with the family , she 's mostly kept to herself			2
after my grandfather 's heart stopped beating in 1965 , @entity1 gradually did away with the supper clubs and bowling leagues			1
friends who still had husbands , she felt , could n't empathize , and so she isolated herself			0
there were kids to feed , bills to pay , clocks to punch			0
@entity1 did interact with new men all the time , but as a saleswoman			1
she picked out shirts and ties , pocket squares and cuff links , like she had for her husband , but in a way that would never again leave her vulnerable to loss			0
@entity52 had built around herself did n't start crumbling until eight years ago , when she moved in to a senior residence in suburban @entity55			1
instantly there were people to deal with -- everywhere and at all times			0
@entity1 was the new girl			1
seven decades removed from high school , and she was once again confronting the notion of how to fit in			0
her first year there , instead of spending winter in @entity62 with my aunt like she usually did , @entity1 opted to stay in @entity65 , where it was freezing , primarily so she would n't come back to dining hall exile			1
@entity0 : becoming a grandmother a lot has changed since then			2
now @entity1 holds an important elected seat on the residents ' council , and enforces behavioral standards at the tables where she eats her meals and plays her card games			1
when one woman dared wag a finger at her over a perceived canasta infraction , @entity1 almost snapped it off			1
when a new resident wanted to sit at @entity1 's dinner table , @entity1 said the matter had to be put to a vote			1
@entity1 , it seems , had morphed into a senior citizen @entity87			1
@entity1 wants to show me her people			1
when she leads me inside , a hierarchy emerges			0
here , there are two types of women : standers and sitters			0
mobility is the first obvious social signifier			1
the more one gets around , the more people one talks to ; the more people one talks to , the more friends one makes			0
earlier in life , this might be called schmoozing or flirting			0
here it 's called " thank @entity106 @entity107			2
" but sitters , too , have their own pecking order			0
i notice a group clustered near a woman with a lion 's mane of white hair , some chunky orange jewels hanging around her neck			2
and while she clearly commands a certain respect among her clique , she lacks the mojo of a stander like @entity1 , who never stops to sink into the couches where sitters sometimes doze off			1
" in the lobby ! " she says , indignant			0
" it makes it look like old people live here			0
if they want to sleep , they should go back to their beds			0
" @entity1 's not shy about publicly vocalizing her disgust for slackers who reflect poorly on the group			1
when she tells a neighbor her hair looks like a " dishmop , " the woman actually replies , " thank you for letting me know			0
" under her breath , @entity1 tells me , " here , they appreciate my honesty			1
" no , she is n't shy with criticism -- @entity1 informed me recently that my girlfriend moved out because i 'd never make enough money to satisfy a woman , and that my writing had possibly peaked			1
but she 's never really trained her sharp tongue on anyone but family			2
her willingness to unleash it here is a measure of her newfound confidence in her position			0
on the way to current events class , we meet a man who tells @entity1 she " really fills out her outfit , " as good a catcall as you 'll get around here			1
earlier , @entity1 explained her position on male attention			1
" i allow some of the men here to flirt with me , " she said			1
" i tease them , but what do i need a man for ? your grandfather 's been gone for 45 years			2
after him , there 's nothing else			2
" it 's obvious she puts some effort into self - presentation , though , as do the other ladies here			1
wardrobe matching now serves the same purpose as showing skin once did ; sync the beading on your cardigan with the details on your brocade socks and you 'll really start turning heads			0
@entity0 : the perfect recipe for family once class begins , @entity1 scolds a woman sitting behind us who believes she is whispering , but whose busted hearing aid has made it impossible for her to gauge what a whisper is			1
" we have a speaker ! " @entity1 barks			1
the man at the lectern , who is well into his tenth decade of life , continues part two of his three - part series on the collapse of the economy : " it 's hard for young people today , " he says , " to earn a decent wage			2
" @entity1 bumps my shoulder with hers			1
i 'm unsure whether the contact is commentary on my occupational status or evidence of a balance issue			0
before dinner , as she does every night , @entity1 occupies a table just outside the dining room			1
" i hold court , " she says , and almost as soon as she says it , people begin to congregate around her			0
every seat is saved for the regular cast -- all standers , no sitters			0
when a woman who is n't part of the group tries to claim a chair , just for a minute so she can tie her shoe , @entity1 tells her she 'd better move on , and swiftly ; the seat is spoken for			1
" everyone 's happy where they are , " @entity1 says			1
" if you try to take anybody 's seat , they 'll kill you			2
" at dinner i 'm quick to say hi to the latest addition at the table , the woman most recently voted in			0
her magenta sweater set perfectly matches the detail work on her cane , which marks her as a potential player			0
the other ladies quickly jump into a conversation about what they should name their @entity260 bowling team ; one suggests the @entity261			0
then they try to peer - pressure the new girl into ditching her cane for a walker			0
essentially , it 's the same conversation younger women have about losing their virginity : all about what other people will think , how it will change you , and how to manipulate a new apparatus without getting hurt			2
" you 'll get used to it , " they tell the new girl			0
" it 's only hard at first			2
" i keep waiting for @entity1 to speak up , but she 's surprisingly above the fray , working very hard at cutting up a friend 's food			1
" macular degeneration , " @entity1 tells me			1
the queen bee precisely tracks everybody 's ailments			2
@entity1 turns the woman 's plate into a diagram for manageable eating , separating the tuna salad from the wax beans from the roasted potatoes , grouping each thing into a perfectly formed triangle			1
if she 's newly emboldened to boss around people outside the family , it seems she 's also found genuine strength in being needed , in rediscovering the moxie it takes to give			1
when the meal is over , @entity1 ambles to the corner of the room to retrieve a friend 's walker			1
@entity1 should n't be getting around without her own walker , but i think she finds it useful here to demonstrate that she still can			1
on her way back , she stops to speak with a woman whose face looked normal yesterday but today resembles a mask of rotten plums			0
she has fallen and bruised herself severely			0
@entity1 did this once , too			1
i 'm watching , actually fearing that my new alpha grandma is about to administer some tough love			0
i 'm ready to see tears			0
but as @entity1 walks back toward me , i notice that the woman , so brutally and freshly injured , is somehow ... smiling			2
i ask @entity1 what she could possibly have said			2
" i 've learned compassion here , " she tells me , simply			1
she knows i 'm stunned			0
" i smile at everyone now			2
i 'm finally at peace			0
you should come to choir practice tomorrow			0
i want you to hear me sing			0
