-- the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity1 lies just 200 miles from the @entity5 border			1
on sunday it will host the first @entity8 @entity7 since 2007 -- and thousands of @entity10 fans are expected to cross the @entity11 to cheer on a driver they know as " @entity14			1
" @entity15 has become one of the darlings of @entity5 , a country that in recent times has become more synonymous for the drugs war waged by @entity20 during his tenure as president			1
the sporting focus this weekend will be on @entity8 , but the problems of its neighbor will come into sharp focus in the @entity5 town of @entity28 -- the closest crossing point for those hoping to see @entity15 at what is , in effect , his home race			1
it is a town that in recent months has become awash with drug - related killings , the most recent resulting in 10 suspected criminals being shot dead in a gunfight with soldiers and the police last month			2
nationwide , the battle against drugs in the last six years has accounted for 60,000 deaths , 16,000 bodies remain unidentified and 24,000 people are missing			0
it 's an issue that @entity15 would rather not speak about			1
not that he shies away from hard subjects in conversation , but simply because he would love his country to be remembered for other reasons			0
" my country is really only in the media for drugs and violence , which is sad , " says the 22 - year - old from @entity52			2
" and yes there have been problems with the @entity59 and drugs , but it 's getting better			2
" people need to focus on the fact it 's a great place , with some great beaches and some great people			2
it 's the best country in the world and i 'm so proud to be @entity5 , " adds @entity15 , as his bright smile breaks out for the first time in conversation			1
it 's not difficult to see his appeal			0
@entity15 has given his country much - needed positive headlines with his performances for the @entity76 team over the past two years , and many of his 114 million compatriots aspire to emulate his success story			1
the times he has been able to return home this season have been relatively few and far between -- such is the punishing schedule of an @entity10 driver -- but the reaction is always the same , and it 's not uncommon for @entity15 to be mobbed in public			1
in @entity52 , he is vying for the crown of the city 's favorite son with his close friend @entity90 , who plays for top @entity92 soccer club @entity91			0
@entity15 knew " @entity90 " long before he became a household name in the @entity94 , and talks fondly of watching him play for his home city in past seasons			1
" the thing is i did n't know how good he was then , " says @entity15 , himself a keen footballer and , like @entity90 , a striker			2
" if i did i would have bought him myself , sold him and made lots of money ! " but obviously i watched him many times play for our city and he was clearly very good			0
but it was still a surprise for us when @entity91 signed him			0
but he 's been very good and scored some good goals lately both for @entity91 and for @entity5			1
" the pair remain in close contact via text , with @entity90 berating @entity15 for his association with @entity114 , which signed up as a partner to the @entity76 team earlier this season			1
" he does n't like seeing me in @entity114 colors , " admits @entity15 with a smile			2
next season , that will no longer be a problem because @entity15 is moving up the grid to @entity124 , a deal that was sealed last month and which led to a wave of texts of congratulations from @entity90 among others			1
@entity15 has been hot property in his sophomore f1 season following a trio of podium finishes at a team usually more renowned for keeping pace somewhere in the midfield of the grid			1
and he admits his sudden rise to the top draws parallels with @entity90 -- who scored just 18 minutes into his @entity91 debut and was crowned player of the year for the 2010 - 11 season as the club won a record 19th @entity92 title			2
" i guess it 's similar , yes , " @entity15 says			1
" i hope i start at @entity124 like @entity90 did at @entity91			2
" @entity15 does not lack for ambition or confidence			2
when asked about his goals for next season , he says deadpan : " just one goal -- to be world champion			0
" while admirable as a target , it 's highly unlikely			0
for one thing , @entity124 is still struggling to match the pace of the front - running @entity157 despite @entity15 's repeated mantra that " i 've joined the best team in the world			1
" then there is the fact that alongside him in the other @entity124 is @entity163 , 10 years old and wiser , and with a world title and 14 race wins to his name			1
but @entity15 is not deterred by such statistics and , in conversation , it 's hard not to buy into his positive outlook -- which @entity124 has clearly done by paying him a reported $ 11 million a year			1
" my target straight away is to win the world championship , " he says			0
" i need to get wins to do that			0
i know it will be very hard to win the championship but it 's the challenge i want			0
" @entity15 is looking forward to working with @entity163 , whose relationship with current teammate @entity179 has seemingly deteriorated this year			1
" i 've spoken to @entity163 a bit since i signed for @entity124 , " says @entity15			1
" he seems to be a great guy and i think he 'll be good fun as a teammate			0
he 's a very tough guy to beat and is very experienced			0
he 's one of the fastest guys out there			0
" not perhaps quite as quick as 2008 world champion @entity179 , who is potentially a daunting act to follow			0
" for sure , i 've got big shoes to fill , " says @entity15			1
" i rate him very highly and he 's maybe the fastest out there			0
it 's going to be tough to follow what he did			0
" @entity124 bosses are confident he will do just that , despite the fact @entity15 has not picked up a single point at @entity76 since signing for the team			1
but it is not the last few races on which the @entity202 team reached its decision			0
@entity15 , the son of a former @entity205 champion and whose elder brother is a @entity207 racer , has always been quick -- he showed that in @entity10 's feeder series competitions			1
however , he has been prone to lapses in concentration and occasional errors			0
those have been rarer this year , and he has been notoriously kind on his @entity214 tires , which in turn has helped him bag top - three placings in @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219			2
where once he was considered aggressive -- and that still flares up on occasion -- @entity15 has a smooth driving style , akin to @entity163			2
it makes him a perfect fit for @entity124 's engineers , who can build the car around essentially similar drivers			1
his efforts this season were not enough , however , to persuade @entity231 to take a risk on him and sign him as a replacement for @entity234			0
@entity15 is a product of the @entity231 driver academy and appeared to be being groomed for a role at the " @entity238			2
" but @entity231 president @entity239 put paid to that back in september by claiming that he lacked the experience required for @entity10 's most successful team			1
@entity124 , looking for a replacement for the @entity243 - bound @entity179 , decided to take the gamble but there is enough to suggest it will pay off			2
his departure will prove costly for @entity76 , which has brought in @entity247 from @entity248 as a replacement			0
@entity15 has long been backed by @entity251 owner @entity250 , the world 's richest man and a backer that @entity124 would dearly love on board			1
the switching of his investment has cast doubt over the future of @entity76 's other driver this year , @entity260 's @entity259 -- who has no major sponsor			2
of his podiums in 2012 , march 's @entity217 race was arguably @entity15 's pinnacle to date , scything his way from 10th on the grid to come within a whisker of beating @entity231 's two - time world champion @entity268 to the win , while he also finished second behind @entity179 at @entity270 in september			1
" all my podiums were equally great , " he says , " but i 'm disappointed i 've not had a win			0
i want to win at @entity76 before leaving			0
" @entity76 has become like a family to me and it 's always hard to leave your family			0
but i have a new family to go to and there comes a point when you have to move up to a new challenge			0
it will be great to join a new team , to have a new experience			0
" before the move , though , @entity15 feels like he has unfinished business in the season 's final two races			1
" i still want to give everything until the last lap of the last lap , " he says			0
" i want to give everything i can			0

@entity10 driver @entity15 looking forward to his " home " race in @entity1 on sunday
the @entity5 is expected to have thousands of fans crossing the border to support him
he has been one of @entity10 's surprise success stories in only his second season on the grid
@entity15 has earned a big - money move to @entity124 after three podium placings in 2012
