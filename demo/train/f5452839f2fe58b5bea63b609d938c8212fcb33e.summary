-- @entity2 athletic director @entity1 compared the alleged hoax about a " girlfriend " that ensnared linebacker @entity6 with the documentary " @entity8			1
" " @entity8 " is no longer simply a river dweller , but rather a verb defined as " to pretend to be someone you 're not online by posting false information , such as someone else 's pictures , on social media sites usually with the intention of getting someone to fall in love with you , " according to the @entity22 show of the same name			1
the show grew from the documentary in which filmmakers @entity25 and @entity26 follow @entity26 's brother @entity27 and his budding online relationship with " @entity29 , " according to the website @entity31			1
the three started to suspect that something was n't quite right with @entity29 , and they set out to solve the mystery , capturing everything on film			2
the documentary was a hit at the @entity39 , @entity37 says			1
on the tv show , @entity40 , a photographer , guides others who suspect that their online loves are not what they seem			1
" so someone will reach out to me and say , ' i 'm really into this guy , we 've been talking online for months			1
he lives far away , we ca n't afford to meet but we definitely want to , i think he is the one			2
can you help ? ' " @entity40 said in an interview with @entity37			0
" will they find love or heartache ? " the show 's introduction asks			2
in one episode , " @entity60 " wants to meet " @entity59 " after months of corresponding via @entity58			0
@entity59 always has an excuse for not meeting or talking , such as not having a cell phone or having a broken webcam			0
suspicious , @entity60 writes to @entity26			0
through a reverse photo search , @entity26 discovers that @entity59 's pictures belong to someone else			0
@entity26 follows the trail and finds that " @entity59 " is really @entity68 , who is having trouble coming to terms with being gay			0
" for many people the life that they lead on the @entity76 , which can be exciting , interesting , and can be filled with hopes and dreams that are perhaps outside of the actual range of their situation , is a big distraction and keeps them from living their real lives , " @entity26 said in the @entity73 interview .			0
