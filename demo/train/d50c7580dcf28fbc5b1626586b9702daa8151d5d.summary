-- @entity2 favorites won two primary elections over more mainstream republicans on tuesday , demonstrating again the clout of the conservative political movement on the political right			1
now the question is whether the right - wing candidates can also defeat @entity11 rivals in november 's congressional elections , when the stakes are higher and the full electorate is deciding			2
the results in @entity16 and @entity17 highlighted the last major day of primary voting before the upcoming election in just under seven weeks			1
voting in seven states and the @entity21 included embattled veteran @entity23 rep. @entity23 's victory in his @entity17 @entity11 primary despite allegations of ethics violations , and @entity21 mayor @entity28 's bid to hold off a major primary challenger			1
in addition , former gov. @entity30 won the @entity33 gubernatorial primary in @entity34 to set up a rematch against @entity36 , the @entity37 who ousted him in 2006			1
in @entity16 , conservative political commentator @entity38 easily defeated nine - time @entity40 rep. @entity39 in the @entity33 @entity42 primary , giving the @entity2 movement another major victory over a candidate backed by the national @entity33			1
" @entity46 will have our voice heard in @entity21 , once again , " a beaming @entity38 told exuberant supporters at her victory party in @entity51			2
@entity38 won more than 53 percent of the vote in the bitter campaign that displayed internal @entity33 warfare between conservative @entity2 supporters and the more moderate party structures			1
@entity39 was backed by the @entity57 , while @entity38 received the endorsement of former @entity60 gov. @entity59 as well as $ 150,000 in late funding from the @entity62			2
@entity38 , running as a @entity21 outsider , insisted the @entity33 establishment was trying to drive her out of the race and hand victory to @entity39 , whom she refers to as " the anointed one			1
" in response , conservative stalwart @entity69 , who fears @entity38 is incapable of winning the @entity42 seat in november , said : " i know @entity59			1
and with all due respect -- @entity38 is no @entity59			2
" in her victory speech , @entity38 made a plea unity , saying : " if those same people who fought against me work just as hard for me , we will win			1
" later , she told @entity0 that she can win without the support of the @entity57			2
" they do n't have a winning track record , " @entity38 said of the national party			1
" if they 're too lazy to put in the effort that we need to win , then , so be it			0
" the @entity85 offered its congratulations to @entity38 immediately after the result was determined			2
" we congratulate @entity38 for her nomination this evening after a hard - fought primary campaign in @entity16 , " said a statement by @entity89 , the @entity85 executive director			1
however , a top @entity33 official told @entity0 on tuesday night that @entity38 will have to show she can generate viable support before the national party will give her money			1
" it is now incumbent on @entity59 , ( @entity40 sen. ) @entity100 and the @entity62 to help support her , " the official said on condition of not being identified by name			0
" they got her here			0
" @entity38 will face @entity37 @entity103 , the @entity104 , in november for the seat formerly held by vice president @entity106			1
in @entity17 , conservative @entity107 defeated @entity108 in the @entity33 gubernatorial primary to set up a november showdown with democrat @entity111 , the son of former gov. @entity112			1
@entity107 received @entity2 support in defeating @entity114 , who also was supported by some conservative groups			1
the @entity17 governor 's post has proven hazardous in recent years			0
gov. @entity119 resigned amid a prostitution scandal , and his successor , @entity121 , decided against running for another term due to allegations of wrongdoing involving @entity126 tickets and a domestic abuse case involving an aide			0
in @entity130 , conservative candidate @entity129 saw an early lead vanish in his bid to upset former state attorney general @entity133 , the candidate favored by establishment @entity33			2
the winner will run in november to succeed retiring @entity136 sen. @entity136			0
@entity133 gave up her state post to run for the @entity42 nomination with encouragement from national @entity33			1
considered the favorite in the seven - candidate contest for months , @entity133 instead found herself with a razor - thin lead with @entity129 , a @entity143 attorney and the 1996 @entity33 nominee for governor , with 52 percent of the returns accounted , according to @entity148 figures			2
local @entity2 groups , the conservative @entity151 newspaper and @entity100 , the influential conservative senator from @entity152 , all backed @entity129			0
unlike @entity38 in @entity16 , though , @entity129 did n't get @entity59 's endorsement			0
instead , @entity59 backed @entity133 , calling her a " @entity154 " and " the true conservative running for the @entity42 in @entity130			0
" however , @entity59 's endorsement and @entity133 's support from many national republicans may have backfired in fiercely independent @entity130			1
victories by @entity38 and @entity107 , and the possibility of a triumph by @entity129 in @entity130 , showed the strength of the @entity2 within the political right , after similar results ousted @entity33 incumbents or insiders in @entity167 and @entity60			1
however , the @entity33 infighting also raised questions about @entity33 unity heading into november			1
@entity23 , meanwhile , received help from former president @entity172 in defeating five challengers in the @entity11 primary for the @entity176 seat he has held for 40 years			2
despite allegations by the @entity178 that @entity23 committed financial wrongdoing and harmed the credibility of @entity181 , he raised more money than his opponents and easily won the vote in his @entity186 district			2
the situation was reversed in @entity21 , where @entity28 swept into office in 2006 promising to fix the @entity21 's struggling schools			0
however , the @entity148 figures showed he trailed @entity192 chairman @entity191 with 28 percent of the votes counted , in part because of union opposition to his education reform efforts			0
" we 've got an uphill battle because we made tough decisions , " @entity28 said before the vote			0
" we 'll continue to make those tough decisions because they 're right for the people			0
but we 're not naive			0
we know this has cost us a little political popularity that we came into the polls with			0
" the race is being closely watched far beyond the @entity21 because the outcome could carry significant implications for the national debate over education reform			0
@entity28 brought in @entity210 as chancellor of @entity212 , and she has since become famous for changes that that have become a model of education reform advocated by the @entity217 administration			0
@entity210 shut down two dozen schools , fired hundred of educators -- including more than 100 teachers this summer -- for poor performance , and overhauled the teacher evaluation system to include , for the first time , student performance as a measure of success			0
local and national teachers unions have fought her efforts			0
@entity0 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
