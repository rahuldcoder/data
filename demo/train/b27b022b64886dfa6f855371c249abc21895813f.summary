-- on a breezy spring day in 1835 , a 13 - year - old boy from the @entity3 region of eastern @entity4 set out for the glittering metropolis of @entity7 to seek his fortune			1
he traveled the 292 mile road on foot , sleeping wherever he could find shelter and taking odd jobs to survive			0
it took him two years to reach the city , where he promptly became an apprentice to a box maker , and ultimately opened his own chest - making workshop			2
@entity22 ceo @entity21 tells @entity0 's @entity23 what 's the secret of @entity20 's longevity			1
a century and a half later , the eponymous company he founded is among the most recognizable luxury brands in the world and , according to @entity29 , is worth nearly $ 30 billion			1
it 's part of the @entity22 consortium whose ceo ( and @entity4 's richest man ) , @entity21 , spoke exclusively to @entity0 about the firm 's heritage , and the spirit of adventure which , he says , defined it from the start : " the history of @entity20 is linked to travel			1
we created luggage for explorers , and during the 20th century our products gradually evolved to reflect the lifestyle of the customer			0
" @entity20 was one of the first luxury retailers to open boutiques in @entity52 and @entity53 and now the label is seeking new frontiers -- looking towards unexplored markets in @entity57 and @entity58			1
" when i went to @entity52 in 1991 for the opening of the first @entity20 shop , you hardly saw any cars on the streets of @entity65 , only bicycles			1
in spite of that we opened a luxury boutique , and now we have more than 20 across the country " says @entity21			2
the company is ever keen to trumpet its craftsmanship ethos			0
indeed , many items are still hand - made in its @entity4 factories - with some workers being trained between 18 months and two years			1
mr @entity21 credits this attention to detail with @entity20 's longevity on the luxury market			1
@entity7 vs @entity80 : who wins in clash of the culture capitals ? the brand 's well - known @entity20 monogram was introduced in 1896 in an effort to combat counterfeits , but @entity21 says that it does n't take a logo to recognize the company 's signature handicraft : " what made @entity20 famous was the quality			1
we do n't do marketing , we just create products which are exceptional in their design and craftsmanship			0
" flamboyant flair in 1997 the company hired @entity100 as the creative director , initiating a long - standing and successful partnership that come to an end in 2013			0
@entity100 designed @entity20 's first ready - to - wear clothing line which premiered at @entity105 to both critical and commercial success , and the brand has since become known for its theatrical and flamboyant fashion shows			1
" it 's very important that when you have a designer like @entity100 , who is a genius , you give him complete freedom			0
so what you see as theatrical scenery is in fact his creativity poured into the fashion show " says @entity21			0
staging a runway presentation remains crucial when it comes to capturing the imagination of customers and the media , even if some of the more outlandish designs do n't make it from the catwalk to the stores : " fashion week is a moment in which designers can show their ideas to the world			0
on the catwalk you see pieces which are innovative and trigger the desire of the customer			0
from these ideas you can then create products which follow that direction , but in a more accessible way			0
" spirit of entrepreneurship @entity20 's parent company @entity22 also owns @entity4 luxury giants @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , and @entity21 travels the world at the helm of the consortium much like an ambassador of @entity158 style			1
is @entity7 still cool ? hell yeah ! ( but not for the reasons you think ) however , he also looks beyond the world of traditional , large companies , and is eager to apply the entrepreneurial spirit of @entity165 to fashion establishments in @entity7 and @entity167			2
" today everybody , including myself , is interested in internet start - ups			2
but you also have start - ups in the designer world , and it 's fascinating to see how we can transform a small company into something very successful on a global scale " he says			2
and when it comes to his goals for the future ? " we want @entity20 to still be the number one brand in ten years			2
in our business , the most important word is desire , so we want to continue creating desire			0
" watch : why is @entity105 so important ?			0

@entity20 started as a trunk maker for the @entity4 elite , including @entity190 , wife of @entity191
the company has always had a spirit of adventure at its core
today , it is one of the most *valuable* luxury brands in the world
