the passing of @entity2 's @entity1 may not have come as a surprise -- his health had deteriorated in recent years -- but until the very end , the monarch was determined to leave an indelible imprint on the throne by articulating and implementing a clear vision for the country			1
@entity1 also seemed to possess the political acumen necessary to adjust to the changing needs and increased political awareness of the @entity2 populace , as well as to the shifting political realities in the @entity17 and elsewhere			1
@entity1 did n't officially ascend until 2005 , but he had been the de facto king since 1995 , when his predecessor and half - brother @entity19 's health started failing			1
it was @entity1 who had to steady the ship during the tumultuous aftermath of the september 11 attacks on the @entity26 and subsequent terrorist attacks inside the kingdom in 2003 and 2004			2
the specter of terrorism not only forced some to question the foundation of @entity2 's " special " relationship with the @entity26 , but also posed a serious threat to the stability of the regime by challenging its @entity37 bona fides on which its entire claim to legitimacy rests			2
although it was the late interior minister @entity41 and his successor who devised the kingdom 's multi-pronged counter-terrorism strategy -- part security operation , part public awareness campaign -- that largely contained the threat from @entity48 , @entity1 's resoluteness and assurances to @entity2 and the international community should not be underestimated			1
many might remember @entity1 for his foreign policy initiatives , including his plan for comprehensive peace between @entity55 and its @entity57 neighbors -- adopted first by the @entity58 in 2002 and then again 2007 -- or his efforts to foster interfaith understanding by sponsoring international forums aimed at bringing together followers of various religions to stress their shared values , as his meeting with pope @entity67 in 2009 illustrated			1
but many @entity2 are likely to think of him as the king who tried to dispel any lingering doubts about the validity of the narrative around which the state was founded : the idea of a @entity2 " nation " and its concomitant notion of a unifying @entity2 identity			2
@entity1 convinced many @entity2 that they are not merely passive observers but rather stakeholders in a still - ongoing nation - building endeavor			1
although he sometimes used the stern tenor of an avuncular patriarch -- as he did when he encouraged @entity2 not to become their own worst enemy by questioning each other 's loyalties -- the frank tone he often used in his speeches ushered in a new era , where @entity2 of all walks of life felt more open to speak about not only what they considered to be the main impediments hindering the kingdom 's development , but also some of the obstacles standing in the way of their own self - fulfilment			1
many in the @entity2 media and burgeoning @entity2 civil society , following the king 's lead , felt emboldened to write and speak about subjects that were once considered off - limits , including extremism among some clerics , government corruption , the role of women , child and spousal abuse , and the soundness of the educational curriculum			1
that is not to say that red lines do not remain and that some have not crossed them and paid a price			0
the imprisonment of some outspoken advocates of reform in 2014 brought @entity2 intense scrutiny from human rights organizations and the @entity126 media			2
those who apparently stepped over the red lines included long - time activists as well as two young women with large followings on social media who tried to cross the @entity2 border while driving			2
the case of young blogger , @entity137 , who was accused of insulting the religious establishment garnered special attention , as his sentence included weekly public flogging			0
these cases prompted some to question whether the @entity2 government was serious about reforms			2
@entity1 's establishment of periodic " @entity147 " allowed some leading @entity2 to have these important debates openly			1
while criticized by some as mere photo ops , these meetings brought together @entity2 from different ends of the political and religious spectrum -- including some leading @entity155 and @entity156 clerics -- who would not have had the opportunity to meet face to face in such a public fashion			1
@entity1 also expanded the membership of the consultative @entity162 , which now includes 30 women			2
just as importantly , it was under his reign that thousands of @entity2 experienced their first taste of democratic politics when they participated in nation - wide elections for municipal councils in 2005			2
the fact that many @entity2 took their children and even grandchildren with them to the polling booths indicates the symbolic importance of this exercise			2
in 2011 , @entity1 took a calculated risk by declaring that women will be eligible to participate and run in the next round of elections in 2015			0
much like his pet project , the @entity180 -- a coeducational graduate level institution aimed at preparing @entity2 to compete in the global economy -- @entity1 's initiatives to empower @entity2 women roiled conservative elements , who continue to view any change as inherently destructive			1
but one of the keys to the longevity of @entity191 has been their ability to balance the competing and conflicting interests of the various segments of @entity2 society and to reach a general consensus			0
@entity1 's reign however , was not controversy - free			0
the @entity2 military 's struggles against the vastly under - equipped @entity201 rebels of northern @entity202 in 2009 compelled some to question the preparedness of the army despite the billions of dollars spent on high tech weaponry and extensive training			0
the kingdom 's dispatch of troops to neighboring @entity210 in 2011 to help quell months of unrest in the tiny monarchy was criticized by @entity210 's @entity156 majority -- not to mention @entity214 -- and also raised eyebrows in the international community			0
intermittent clashes between @entity2 security forces and the @entity156 majority in the kingdom 's eastern province also created a sense of unease among some who considered the unrest a harbinger of the @entity228 's arrival to the kingdom			0
along the same lines , and although widely hailed in the @entity126 as a positive move , @entity2 's participation in the @entity26 - led airstrikes against @entity233 strongholds in @entity234 was not risk - free and seems to have only intensified the terror group 's animosity for the @entity2 government and leadership			0
the @entity2 have apparently also agreed to train " moderate " @entity234 fighters on @entity2 soil -- an uncharacteristically forceful and public intensification of its involvement in the @entity234 crisis			0
despite what some considered his " weak " familial ties within the royal family , @entity1 's popularity among @entity2 seemed to have been rooted in his realization that the monarch 's most important base of support going forward must be the @entity2 populace at large			1
it is noteworthy that even some of the @entity2 government 's harshest critics both inside and outside the kingdom seldom blamed @entity1 personally for what they considered to be the kingdom 's shortcomings			1
although some maintain that the persona of the wise yet humble patriarch was carefully constructed , @entity1 's affable demeanor and seemingly genuine concern for the well - being of average @entity2 endeared him to many			1
most @entity2 will remember him fondly			1
as for the new king , @entity271 , it is instructive to remember that some in the international community also expressed trepidation about @entity1 before he ascended the throne			1
he was perceived by some as more conservative and less pro-western than his predecessor , @entity19			0
some thought that these leanings would manifest themselves in a more " pan-arab " stance and a less amenable posture towards the @entity126 , and especially the @entity26			0
those fears were largely unfounded			0
while there is little doubt that the @entity234 crisis , the aftermath of the @entity228 and nuclear negotiations with @entity214 have created what seemed at times to be a serious rift in @entity2 - @entity26 relations , it is highly debatable that it was @entity1 alone whose views on these issues differed from those of the @entity26 these still - unresolved crises and impasses will likely continue to be sticking points under @entity271			1
@entity271 will likely shuffle some top government positions around , and his style might be a little different than @entity1 's			0
at some point , he will likely try to put his own stamp on the throne			0
that , however , is not likely to be by changing the nature of @entity2 - @entity26 relations in any fundamental way			0
some have argued that the secret to the longevity of the @entity2 royal family is its careful attention to three constants : @entity37 , oil and its relations with the @entity26 @entity271 is not likely to lose sight of that			0
under @entity271 , bilateral relations with the @entity26 will likely continue to be " special			0

until his passing , @entity1 remained committed to articulating and implementing a clear vision for @entity2
many remember the monarch for his foreign policy initiatives , including his plan for comprehensive peace between @entity55 and its @entity57 neighbors
@entity1 allowed @entity2 to follow his lead and speak with greater freedom about a range of issues
