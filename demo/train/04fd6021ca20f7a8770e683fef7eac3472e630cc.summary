-- at the end of first grade , 7 - year - old @entity3 , an easy - going , cheerful little boy from a tiny rural town in western @entity6 , suddenly did n't want to go to school anymore			0
when @entity3 adamantly refused to have a play date with a good friend , his mom , @entity8 , 36 , knew something was wrong with her middle child			2
his change in behavior just did n't make sense			0
" @entity3 finally broke down in tears and told me that several boys at school had been teasing him relentlessly , making fun of his hair , his clothes , calling him names , and not letting him play at recess			1
and one of those boys was his good friend , " @entity8 says			2
while the friend was n't actively participating in the teasing , @entity3 told his mom that he was doing nothing to stop it , which made it all even worse			0
at first @entity8 stayed silent , hoping the mean behavior would disappear over the summer			0
but when it picked up again at the start of second grade , @entity8 went to the principal with her concerns			0
@entity8 says that the principal dismissed the charge and convinced her that the behavior was n't bullying , but instead , it was simply boys being mean			1
unsatisfied , @entity8 visited the principal two more times -- now armed with both the definition of " bullying " that she printed from the website @entity47 , as well as the @entity49 statute on how it defined the term			2
both times , @entity8 says , the principal ( who declined to comment for this story ) disagreed that @entity3 was being bullied and refused to act -- the superintendent in @entity56 was no help either			0
six months later the @entity58 moved to another town			0
with horror stories about girls who have been bullied dominating the news , some parents are asking whether we also need to focus as much attention on how boys respond to harsh or abusive interactions with their peers			2
was the principal correct in assuming that the actions of 7 - year - old boys were simply mean boy behavior , or did it constitute bullying ? and does it make a difference ? " even if the behavior did n't technically match up to the definition of bullying , if the kids were being mean and there was a pattern of the kids ganging up on him -- which , by the way , does constitute bullying -- that still should n't be condoned and supported by not addressing it , " says @entity76 , author of " masterminds and @entity78 : helping @entity90 with @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , and the @entity94			1
" " the principal is literally telling those boys they have the carte blanche to not only continue the behavior , but increase the abuse because they can get away with it			2
" are we too quick to cry ' bully ' ? with " masterminds and @entity115 , " @entity104 set out to replicate with boys the success she had examining the social dynamics of girls in her book " @entity114 , " the inspiration for the movie " @entity113			1
" in her latest book , @entity104 reveals the ways boys think , uncovers their complicated emotional lives and explores how the power of their social hierarchies influences their emerging identity			1
historically , bullying among boys has been complicated and sometimes tough to identify			1
the belief in a " boys - will - be - boys " mentality still persists , whether it 's on a playground or in a college fraternity			1
and it is n't always about targeting the weakest kid			0
cruel taunts and physical tests can be also be a form of bonding among boys			1
the term bullying has become so radioactive in recent years with its strong links to adolescent suicide and school shootings , it has prompted state legislatures to take serious action , making bullying a crime in many states			2
officially accusing kids of bullying can carry serious , long - term consequences			1
according to stopbullying.gov the definition of bullying is : unwanted , aggressive behavior among school - aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance			2
the behavior is repeated , or has the potential to be repeated , over time			0
the types of bullying include : teasing , name - calling , taunting , inappropriate sexual comments , threatening to cause harm , leaving someone out on purpose , spreading rumors , trying to hurt someone 's reputation , hitting , kicking , tripping , pinching , spitting , taking or breaking someone 's things or making mean or rude hand gestures			1
should parents be liable for their children 's bullying ? about 16 % of students report being bullied , while 7 % report bullying others , according to " bullying in @entity179 schools , " a report published in 2013 by the @entity181 with research from the @entity183			1
boys report they were most frequently bullied by other boys , while girls were bullied by both girls and boys			2
in almost all grades , girls and boys were victimized at similar rates			2
" boys consistently bully other students more than girls do , and they do so at higher rates as they get older , " the survey found			2
in her research , @entity104 has found that while boys might get more physical than girls , the psychological hallmarks of bullying are similar			1
the playing field has been further leveled with the spread of cyberbullying			1
cyberbullying is when a child or teenager is harassed , humiliated , tormented , embarrassed or threatened using digital technology			0
mean texts or e-mails , pictures , videos and fake profiles can all be forms of abuse			0
and the pervasive reach of technology can make the bullying potentially more devastating			0
parents , beware of bullying on sites you 've never seen " when you think of a child being bullied , maybe you think of a loner kid , the nerd , the geek , that 's the picture that comes to my mind , " says @entity223 of @entity224 , @entity225 , and mom of 13 - year - old @entity227			1
" but my son plays @entity238 football and he 's a competitive hockey player and he was being bullied for years			0
" @entity223 says life got significantly worse for her son in sixth grade when the kids started ganging up on @entity227 on the popular app @entity243			0
she says about half of the class , girls included , began making fun of @entity227 's clothes , his lunch , his hockey skills and the video games he liked			0
it got so bad that @entity227 announced to his mom one night that he wanted to kill himself and headed into the kitchen for a knife			0
the next morning @entity223 went to school with @entity227 and headed straight for the principal			0
when @entity223 shared with the principal that her son had threatened suicide , the school immediately jumped into action			0
the principal and teacher met with the students in @entity227 's class and they also sent a letter home to the parents discussing bullying and its effect on a classmate			1
things at school did get better , but @entity227 switched to a middle school this year with none of his former classmates			0
" he now has a great group of friends and he helps other kids deal with bullying			1
he 's the first one who stands up to bullying and he stands a little taller now , " says @entity223			1
" but do n't assume that if you bring the problem to the school they will handle it , parents need to stay involved			0
" while many schools and parents are hyper - aware of the dangers and prevalence of bullying , have we gone too far in labeling what some may argue has always been normal aggressive behavior between kids ? " every conflict is not bullying and if we call it that , then it loses the power of the word , " says @entity104			1
not all conflict amounts to bullying and by overusing the word , we risk reducing the power of the word to describe real bullying , says @entity104			1
she believes that , to a certain extent , allowing boys and girls to work out their own problems is useful training for resolving conflicts at every stage of life			0
the challenge is to stay on top of what 's really happening in your child 's life , particularly when kids routinely answer with an " i 'm fine " -- even if they 're not			1
" there 's nothing wrong with kids trying to figure things out on their own , " she says			1
" at the same time , there are kids who are being systemically denigrated and targeted in school and blown off by administrators and teachers			0

bullying among boys can be tough to spot because of societal *expectations* around rough play
*experts* say boys might be more physical in their bullying but cyberbullying levels the playing field
@entity76 , who studies social hierarchies , says it 's important to let kids resolve conflict
