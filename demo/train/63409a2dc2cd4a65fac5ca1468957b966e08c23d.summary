announced plans wednesday to begin the painstaking and dangerous process of removing fuel rods from a crippled reactor at the site			1
the procedure is considered a milestone in the estimated $ 50 billion cleanup of the @entity17 nuclear power plant			1
" fuel removal really means the start of decommissioning , " plant chief @entity18 said , according to @entity7 's @entity19			2
when the tsunami swamped the plant , located 149 miles ( 240 kilometers ) north of @entity26 on @entity7 's eastern seaboard in march 2011 , it cut the power to vital cooling systems for the three reactors in use at the time			1
this resulted in the second - worst nuclear accident in history -- after @entity35 in the @entity36 in 1986 -- as the reactors melted down and leaked radioactive material into the atmosphere			0
the ' nuclear renaissance : ' what went wrong ? the @entity17 cleanup has been beset by numerous problems , including the leak of 300 tons of radioactive water from a storage tank			1
@entity1 will begin taking out 1,500 spent fuel units from reactor 4 for storage in safer specially designed containers , the company says			1
the reactor building exploded in the aftermath of tsunami likely due to a build - up of hydrogen from a neighboring reactor , according to @entity1			2
the cost of decontamination is estimated to be Â ¥ 5 trillion ( @entity59 $ 50.7 billion ) or more , @entity7 's @entity58 reported			0
after @entity17 : could @entity63 's nuclear gamble backfire ? @entity64 continues for @entity26 on the @entity17 disaster			0
