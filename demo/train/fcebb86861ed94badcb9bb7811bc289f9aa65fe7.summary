" @entity25 : how does an air crash investigation work ? two others -- both 16 - year - old girls from @entity28 -- were reported dead soon after the @entity30 crash - landed at @entity31			1
one of those teenagers was hit on the runway by a fire truck , though it 's unclear whether she was already dead when she was struck , @entity31 police spokesman @entity32 said			1
at the time , firefighters were using flame retardant that ended up surrounding areas immediately around the plane with foam , @entity32 said			1
" when the truck repositioned itself to get a better aim of the fuselage , they discovered the body of the victim in the fresh track from the path of the truck , " he added			2
the foam was thick enough to cover a body , @entity32 noted			2
moreover , it is difficult for those in the " industrial - size " fire trucks that responded to crash to see things on the ground , the police spokesman said			1
" right now , we are waiting results from the coroner to determine if she died from the crash or the fire engine going over her , " the police spokesman said			1
" and that will be part of our investigations , like any other case , by our hit - and - run and major accidents investigations teams			2

the plane 's fuselage was hauled away on flatbed trucks friday to a remote section of the airport , @entity31 said in a news release			1
on friday , a @entity101 jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that , for the first time in six days , all four of the airport 's runways were operational			1
" the tremendous efforts and around - the - clock work of airport staff , government agencies , airline tenants and contractors allowed us to complete all repairs and safety certifications for @entity117 in a timely and efficient manner , " airport director @entity107 said			2
while the wreckage has been hauled away , investigators still have not pinpointed exactly why @entity121 crashed , or who was to blame			0
