@entity0 -- the @entity3 seal who says he shot and killed @entity5 says he is worried the @entity6 might prosecute him for publicly telling his story of the may 2011 raid on the @entity11 leader 's compound in @entity12			1
but @entity13 said the value of sharing the details of the mission for the families of the september 11 , 2001 , victims and military veterans killed in the ensuing wars makes that risk worthwhile			1
" i think i did this in a way that does n't violate any tactics or any rules , " he said in an interview on @entity1 's " @entity23 " with @entity24			2
being prosecuted , he said , " does concern me , and if it comes up , i 'll address it			2
" in his most extensive live television interview to date , @entity13 said he realized the power of his story while speaking with a group that included about 20 families of victims of the september 11 attacks			1
he said it was the first time he 'd really spoken about the mission , and that men and women cried and told him " it was closure for them			0
" at that moment , he said , he realized the importance of sharing what he could -- and that he needed to find a way to do so " with respect for the tactics , for the safety of our troops and for the @entity6			2
" responding to criticisms from former administration officials and current servicemembers that he should n't be talking publicly , @entity13 said , " i think it 's important historically for this to get out there			1
" " we were the end of a long , long time of grieving , " he said			0
" we were everybody on that mission			0
you know , we were the @entity65 , the police department , the @entity67 , the @entity68 , we were the @entity69 people , the 9/11 families , and we were able to go there -- and just that i was able to be a part of that is just the greatest honor that 's ever been asked of me			1
" @entity13 described many of the details of the mission -- and his preparation beforehand			1
seal who says he shot @entity5 details leadup to raid he said he believed there was " about a 90 percent chance that we were n't going to come back			1
" among the possible threats : @entity12 's military , unaware of the mission , could shoot the two helicopters down			2
@entity5 's house could be wired with explosives			1
others in the house could be wearing suicide vests			0
" the house getting blown up , possibly getting shot down , suicide bombers , and then possibly running out of gas was a concern , " he said			0
" the chances of us not coming back were a lot greater than the chances we were coming back			0
" he said he called his family members beforehand -- not offering details on what he was doing , but knowing that they 'd soon find out no matter how the mission ended			2
he also wrote letters to his young children , only to be delivered if he did n't survive at a later date when , for instance , he was n't there for their weddings			0
after the mission started , @entity13 described landing outside @entity5 's compound on the second of two helicopters , after the first one had crash - landed			1
he said he was the eighth seal in line as they moved from the compound 's first floor to its second			1
on that floor , six ahead of him split off to take out @entity5 's son , clear other rooms and identify potential threats			1
he was now second in line headed to the third floor , where they expected to find @entity5			2
opinion : did @entity13 really kill @entity5 ? as the group reached the third floor , he said , the seal in front of him dove on top of an " unknown " person -- it turned out to be a woman -- to absorb what they feared could be a blast from a suicide vest			1
he said he thought " let 's get this over with " as he entered the room expecting to be blown up by @entity5			1
that 's when @entity13 identified the @entity11 mastermind			1
" i shot him twice in the head , he fell on the floor , " he said			0
" i shot him one more time , and i killed him			2
" the magnitude of what he 'd done did n't register immediately			0
@entity13 first worried about eliminating other potential threats -- moving a woman and child out of the way , and then clearing the room			2
" it was n't until the room was cleared and there were more seals in the room that it kind of hit me			0
i had a moment of pause , " he said			0
a friend put his hand on @entity13 's shoulder			1
" i said , ' hey , what do we do now ? ' " @entity13 said			2
" he said , ' now we go find the computers			0
' i said , ' ok , i 'm back			0
' " the 90 - minute flight back to the @entity69 air base in @entity172 was stressful , too , as the @entity158 counted down the time until they exited @entity12 's airspace			0
then , they could exhale			0
one seal laid next to @entity5 's body to measure his height -- part of confirming his identity			1
the group had n't brought a tape measure			0
later , @entity13 sat feet from @entity5 's body , eating a breakfast sandwich and watching a flat - screen television , while watching president @entity185 announce to the world that the @entity69 had killed @entity5			1
" i think , " he told @entity1 , " i was part of a team full of heroes			0
" @entity175 commander to @entity158 : seal it			0
