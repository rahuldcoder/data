" the challenges , including a city deficit that could reach $ 120 million , would mean the loss of 324 officers , more than 15 percent of the force , under a budget unveiled by chief @entity59			1
" this is devastating , " he told reporters tuesday			2
" none of us signed up for this kind of task			1
