most 911 centers ca n't receive text messages			1
but that does n't always stop people from texting the familiar number in an emergency , not knowing their pleas for help wo n't be seen			0
a new initiative announced friday will finally bring the 20 - year - old sms texting technology to emergency centers across the country in the coming years			0
the top four wireless carriers in the @entity14 have agreed to speed up their efforts to support text - to - 911 capabilities , making it available by may 15 , 2014 , according to a statement from the @entity19 released friday			1
" access to 911 must catch up with how consumers communicate in the 21st century -- and today , we are one step closer towards that vital goal " said @entity19 chairman @entity20			1
once the carriers are set up , local emergency response centers will still need the proper equipment , software and training , so the feature wo n't be available instantly			0
however , eventually the carriers and @entity19 hope to provide 90 % of the population with text - to - 911 features			1
the service will not support third - party texting apps or roaming users			0
in the meantime , the carriers will implement a much - needed alert message warning anyone who sends a text to 911 that their message was not received , and that they should make a phone call instead			1
that auto - reply system will be up and running by june 30 , 2013			2
the carriers will handle support for texting until the national next - generation 911 service is completed in the next decade			2
most 911 systems are managed locally , but the next - generation 911 project is a national push to update the systems to handle modern communications , including calls over the @entity56 , images and photos			0
one - third of the estimated 240 million calls to 911 are from wireless lines			2
current systems do support the modern technology -- for example , some can pinpoint what tower a call was routed through to determine a caller 's location -- but @entity9 text support has been more difficult .			0

the top four @entity14 wireless carriers have agreed to support text - to - 911 by 2014
the *announcement* was made today by the @entity19
until the system is running , people will receive *bounce* - back messages
