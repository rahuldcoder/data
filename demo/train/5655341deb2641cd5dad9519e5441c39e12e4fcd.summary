-- former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 was convicted monday of negligence related to the collapse of his nation 's banking system , but he was cleared of three other charges and will face no punishment , a court official said			1
afterward , @entity2 insisted that he 'd been acquitted on the most serious charges that deal most directly with the origins and handling of the crisis			1
he characterized the lone conviction as relatively inconsequential and " ridiculous			1
" " i have just followed the traditions of all my predecessors as leaders of the @entity3 @entity19 have practiced throughout the decades			2
and maybe i 'm just taking a hit for all of them , " @entity2 said			2
" but the point is that this ( conviction ) has nothing to do with the financial crisis			0
" politicians in @entity27 and beyond have been harshly criticized and , in some cases , forced out of office in the wake of a wave of economic woes , including governments and banks ' role in contributing to debt and other crises			0
yet even in all the financial chaos , @entity3 has been exceptional -- and only partly because its leader was the first to be criminally charged and , on one count , convicted			1
once one of the world 's wealthiest countries per capita , @entity3 took a huge hit in 2008 when its banking system collapsed spectacularly , wiping out billions of dollars in savings			1
the ripple effect was felt far beyond the island nation , particularly in @entity49 and the @entity50			0
those two nation 's governments came up with more than $ 5 billion to bail out its citizens who 'd put their money in @entity3 - based banks			2
that prompted a bitter dispute when those countries demanded that @entity3 compensate them , as required by a @entity61 directive			0
the @entity62 loaned @entity3 $ 2.1 billion in november 2009 , at which time it made repaying the money to the @entity49 and @entity50 governments a requirement of the loan			0
that same year , @entity67 was ousted as prime minister			0
and last month , after a judge had thrown out two additional charges , his trial began on four counts : failing to ensure that a financial stability group delivered the required results , failing to take action to reduce the size of @entity3 's banking system , failing to verify the move of accounts from @entity83 bank 's @entity81 program , and failing to focus more cabinet meetings on the crisis			1
@entity2 called the first three charges , of which he was cleared , " substantive " in that they were allegations that tied into his and his government 's role in the crisis			1
he described the one charge he was convicted of , meanwhile , as " purely formulaic : did we discuss or not discuss ( the financial crisis ) enough ? " the former prime minister acknowledged that he , like others , had " made mistakes " but said he 's not to blame for what happened			2
there were a host of reasons , he said , including @entity3 's reliance on what he described as a flawed @entity27 financial regulatory framework and the danger posed by " the free flow of capital across borders unless there are certain preventive measures in place			1
" " there was a lot of irregular stuff going on within the banking system , and of course ... there was an international financial crisis , " @entity2 said			1
" we did n't see that coming			0
" he added that " nobody has been complaining about the way we handled the crisis , which has been described as very successful by a lot of people			0
" in fact , the @entity62 has forecast economic growth of 2.5 % for the island nation in 2012 , and the ratings agency @entity128 has raised @entity3 's long - term debt back to investment grade			1
" in many ways , we are ahead of the curve , " @entity2 said , comparing @entity3 with @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , which also received bailouts			2
" we are moving faster out of the crisis than these countries are			0
" @entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
