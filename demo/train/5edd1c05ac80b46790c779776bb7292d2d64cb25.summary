@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 rebels and troops loyal to @entity5 shelled each other for hours on saturday in clashes at the highly contested frontline of @entity0 , an embattled town just west of the besieged port city of @entity10			1
at least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in @entity0 this week , according to a @entity2 team			1
heavy government shelling on @entity10 and @entity0 began shortly after @entity5 rallied his supporters in an audio message on state tv and threatened to take the fighting to @entity23 in retaliation for @entity26 's bombing campaign			1
" as soon as @entity5 's speech ended , they started shelling @entity0 and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside @entity10 itself , and it continues on the front this morning , " said @entity2 's @entity27 , who was in @entity10 saturday			1
@entity5 has vowed vengeance for @entity26 bombings in @entity1			1
he said the @entity1 military could be " like locusts , like bees " in @entity23 , potentially targeting homes and offices			0
" you are mistaken , you are involved in a battle that you do n't know what you are going to face , so withdraw and run away , " @entity5 told a pro-government gathering in @entity43			1
" our people is able in one day to move the battle to the @entity50 , and able to move the battle to @entity23			0
" @entity5 referred to @entity26 , which began bombing military targets in @entity1 after the @entity53 approved a resolution in march authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians			2
@entity1 government spokesman @entity60 on saturday reiterated @entity5 's call for vengeance			1
@entity26 's " aggression is killing our children ( and ) @entity23 will have to face the consequences , " he said			2
" you will have people attacking @entity23 , joining terrorist organizations against @entity23 , and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against @entity23			0
" @entity60 claimed rebel fighters " have no popular support			0
" " the rebels have no future , " he added			0
" they know it and they are terrified			0
" on saturday , @entity78 secretary of state @entity77 said the @entity26 mission in @entity1 is on track , with pressure on @entity5 mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger			1
" we need to see this through , and we are in complete agreement that we will , " she said alongside the @entity88 foreign minister in @entity89 saturday			0
in @entity92 , @entity91 spokesman @entity90 said the @entity78 was taking seriously the @entity1 leader 's remarks			2
" certainly this is an individual who 's obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats , " he told reporters			0
" it 's what makes him so dangerous			0
but he 's also someone who 's given to overblown rhetoric			0
" he said the @entity78 would continue to support @entity26 's mission of increasing pressure on @entity5 to step aside			1
the events came one day after the @entity107 's special committee on @entity1 said it had officially presented a plan meant to help @entity1 find a way out of the current crisis			1
the proposal states that @entity5 will not be part of the negotiation process , but stops short of saying he should step down			2
" it is envisaged to convene , soon , in @entity117 , ( @entity118 ) negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals , " the group said in a statement			0
committee members have met with @entity5 and opposition leaders over the past three months			2
another @entity107 - led attempt to broker peace between @entity5 and the rebels fell through in april			1
the @entity128 government was in talks with @entity1 rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition , a @entity1 opposition military spokesman in @entity10 said thursday			1
the @entity128 government has not confirmed the claim , which follows an acknowledgment earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere			2
@entity2 's @entity27 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
