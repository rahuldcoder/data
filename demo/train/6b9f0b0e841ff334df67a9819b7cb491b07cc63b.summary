-- @entity2 has paid out $ 5.76 million to the estate of @entity4 , its heralded head football coach who lost his job as part of a spiraling sex abuse scandal involving one of his former assistants , a school athletic official said thursday			1
@entity11 , an assistant athletic director and spokesman for the university , said via e-mail that more than half of the payout -- $ 3 million -- was in the form of a retirement bonus			0
the school gave @entity4 's estate the balance of his employment contract because his exit as head of the @entity26 ' football program was officially considered a retirement , not a termination , according to @entity11			1
more details will be posted on http://openness.psu.edu , a website set up by the school to provide information about the case			0
the university 's board of trustees fired @entity4 last november because its members thought he failed to take his knowledge of a scandal at the school to the appropriate authorities , the board said in a report posted last month			1
the controversy revolves around @entity44 , 68 , a longtime defensive coordinator for the @entity26			0
he faces 52 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys dating back to 1994 , with prosecutors alleging that some of this illicit behavior occurred in @entity2 athletic facilities			2
@entity4 testified to a grand jury that a graduate assistant told him in 2002 that he had seen @entity44 in the showers " fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy			1
" " while coach @entity4 did his legal duty by reporting that information the next day ... to his immediate superior , the then @entity2 athletic director @entity62 , the board reasonably inferred that he did not call police , " said the report explaining @entity4 's firing			1
" we determined that his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership by @entity4			2
" @entity62 and @entity70 , a senior vice president at the university , are charged with perjury and failure to report a crime in relation to the investigation -- specifically , the account passed on to them by @entity4			1
@entity4 himself was never charged with a crime			0
his ouster as coach , hours after he issued a statement saying he 'd retire at the end of the 2011 season , spurred riots by his supporters on the @entity2 campus			1
in his final interview in january , he told the @entity90 that he 'd felt inadequate to deal with the initial allegation of abuse -- saying he " did n't know exactly how to handle it and ... was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was			0
" @entity4 , 85 , died january 22 at a hospital in @entity98 after battling lung cancer			0
just before the scandal erupted , he 'd become the winningest coach in major college football history by leading his teams to 409 victories			0
in 46 years under his leadership , the @entity26 won two national championships , went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times , according to his official @entity2 biography			2
@entity0 's @entity111 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 trustees ousted @entity4 as head football coach last november
a report later cited his failure to do more about a sex abuse allegation involving @entity44
