@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a dusty day in the northern-most emirate of @entity0 , 40 - year - old @entity3 wrestles playfully with his four - legged friend @entity5 over a chew toy			1
but @entity5 is not a dog -- he 's a fully - grown @entity9 lion			1
" there is a special language , i can say , between him and i , " said @entity3			0
@entity3 rescued @entity5 from a farm where , he says , he was a neglected pet			1
" i treated him differently than how he had been treated before			0
so , a love story began between us			0
he would only eat if he saw me there			0
if i was n't there , you would feel he was upset			0
he would wait for me			0
" with an @entity9 lion , love can be tough			2
@entity3 said he 's been bitten several times -- always during play --- and although he trusts @entity24 implicitly , he always treats him with caution and respect			2
@entity3 's main concern during playtime is that one of @entity5 's claws may accidentally come out			0
" he could tear my flesh , " he said			0
@entity3 manages the @entity34 , set up a few years ago under the patronage of @entity36 , one of the @entity0 's royals			0
he has been adopting neglected and mistreated animals for more than 15 years			1
many of those animals , including @entity41 , are endangered or exotic , and were initially bought on the black market			1
owning an endangered animal as a pet is illegal in the @entity1 , a signatory of the @entity46 on the @entity47 ( @entity48 )			1
however , the trade in endangered wildlife remains a problem in the @entity52 , where owning expensive exotic pets , especially big cats , is the ultimate status symbol			1
a rare white lion sells for around $ 50,000 on the black market , @entity58			1
none of the pet owners we approached would speak on the record about illegally purchasing exotic animals , but many amateur videos uploaded online attest to their popularity among young men in the @entity52			1
in one @entity69 clip that was widely viewed in the region , a man frightens his friend by chasing him around the living room with a chained lioness			0
another clip shows a group of men walking a cheetah on a leash in an indoor location			1
there 's even a man trying to ride a fully grown lion			2
it is all about bragging rights for the men buying these animals , says @entity3			1
" if someone buys a very expensive animal , he is boasting that he has enough money to get anything he wants , " he said			2
" if he has a tamed wild animal like a lion , he is trying to show off that he is brave			1
but this is not courage ; this is animal rights abuse			2
" it has largely fallen on private individuals like @entity3 , backed by the government , to care for neglected illegally obtained animals			2
more than 200 illegal animals in the @entity1 were confiscated alive by the authorities in 2010 , according to @entity48			2
most big cats are sent to the @entity58 , which is privately funded by @entity105 , a member of @entity58 's ruling family			0
the large cages harbor a staggering variety of rare animals -- white lions , white tigers , black jaguars , cheetahs , baboons and wolves -- to name a few			1
also on inside the @entity116 : @entity118 foodies ditch fast food for fine dining @entity121 shoulders the burden of smaller animals			2
the the petite mother of four cares for almost 300 animals as varied as iguanas , alpacas , foxes , monkeys and pheasants in her residential villa that doubles up as the @entity134			2
all the animals were abandoned or rescued and some are exotic and endangered			1
her closest friend , an endangered @entity139 macaw named @entity140 , was abandoned in a cardboard box in a parking lot			1
@entity140 sits perched on her shoulder throughout the interview , pecking at the microphone			0
relying on help from volunteers , @entity121 spends most of her income taking care of the animals			2
the recently widowed government employee spends a hefty $ 10,000 per month to cover everything from veterinary costs to electricity for 19 air - conditioning units for the animal cages			2
" we do n't save anything			0
i do n't have any retirement fund ; it 's all for the animals , " said @entity121			2
she added that she carries financial burden because the reward is priceless			0
" the passion and the love that you get from ( the animals ) is amazing and if there 's anything i can do to help animals you ca n't put a price on it			0
" recently granted land by the @entity174 government , @entity121 can not afford to build the infrastructure for the rescue center that she hopes will one day be her legacy			0
her passion for animals goes back to her childhood			0
both her parents died of cancer when she was nine and her siblings were split up			0
@entity121 says animals helped her cope			0
also on inside the @entity116 : how to rebel , @entity118 style " i got so much love from these guys , they used to make me so happy , i used to just go sit in the alleyways and just feed a dog or touch a cat and i used to be so happy , " she said			0
@entity121 said people buy exotic animals without understanding the unique needs they have and the level of responsibility involved			1
people who buy baby lion and tiger cubs can no longer take care of them when they get larger and start showing violent tendencies			1
it 's not just locals -- many expatriate families leave their pets behind when the leave the country			1
both @entity121 and @entity3 realize they are in a legal gray area when it comes to the exotic animals they shelter			1
any endangered animal needs appropriate paperwork from @entity48			1
animals that have been smuggled into the country , even if rescued , technically remain illegal by international standards despite having permissions from local authorities			1
but these animal lovers say paperwork will not stop them from doing the right thing			1
@entity3 said he has reached out to animal rights groups and wants their help setting up a wildlife reserve in @entity0 , since the animals ' legal limbo makes repatriation difficult			1
he says he is surprised that recent media attention , instead of bringing him assistance , has brought him criticism from some			0
" my wish is that , instead of criticizing me , these people would offer me help			0
i have n't done anything wrong ; i 've protected these animals and created a sanctuary for them			0
i 'm trying to get them to appropriate wildlife reserves			0

for many young men in the @entity52 , keeping an exotic pet -- a lion , tiger or cheetah -- is an ultimate status symbol
the smuggled and endangered animals are usually mistreated and often abandoned
meet the animal lovers running *sancturies* for rescued exotic pets and see the rare bonds they have formed with them
