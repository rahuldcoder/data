-- they struggled to get pregnant for nearly two years			1
they gave it a go the natural way and then did three or four intrauterine inseminations , where the sperm is washed , concentrated and placed directly into a woman 's uterus at an optimal time			2
but as mom and dad were both " pushing 40 , " these methods did n't work , and the couple decided to try in vitro fertilization			1
with in vitro , or @entity17 , several eggs are fertilized outside the body ; the resulting embryos are then implanted in the woman 's womb			1
it worked -- on the first try			2
but the result was n't exactly what this couple was looking for			1
" to say we 're excited would be an exaggeration , " the dad wrote on @entity28 in an anonymous post that recently started trending on social media			2
" more truthfully , we 're pissed			2
and terrified , and angry , and guilty , and regretful			2
" you see , both embryos that were implanted stuck			2
the wife is pregnant with twins			1
" i lay on the table -- dazed and unhappy -- as i received the news that there were two healthy sacs present , " the anonymous mom wrote in a separate post			2
" we were pregnant with twins -- twin boys , we 'd find out later			1
in my mind i had done nothing less than ruin our family			0
" to say the reaction from @entity28 's readers was angry would be an understatement			0
many blasted the couple for being ungrateful			1
up , " one commenter wrote			0
but there was a small majority who seemed to sympathize with how these new parents were feeling : overwhelmed , exhausted and afraid they wo n't be able to provide for these new lives in addition to their older son			0
multiple births are an increasingly common outcome for couples using assisted reproductive technology , according to the @entity65 , and @entity17 is often responsible			1
" a woman undergoing @entity17 has an approximate 22-fold increased risk of conceiving a twin pregnancy and a 100-fold increased risk of conceiving a triplet pregnancy , as compared with natural conception , " @entity65 's website says			1
so why do doctors still occasionally place multiple embryos in women who undergo @entity17 ? because the chances that even one will stick and grow into a baby are low			1
according to the @entity82 , women under the age of 35 have a less than 43 % chance of giving birth after @entity17 ; women over 41 have a less than 18 % chance			1
dr. @entity87 , a fertility specialist in @entity89 , always has a long conversation with her patients before implanting any embryos			0
she said she discusses the risks , the possibility of multiples and the chances that the couple may not get pregnant			1
" they may be angry because maybe that 's not what they wanted , " @entity98 said of the anonymous couple on @entity28			1
" but they have to ask themselves : did you have a conversation that stressed the fact that you did not want more than one pregnancy ? " the problem , she said , is that no doctor can promise which embryos are going to take , if any at all			0
@entity17 specialists have become more cautious			1
as doctors saw the multiple birth rates increase dramatically in the @entity118 , they began transferring fewer embryos to the mother			1
most of the time , @entity98 said , she only implants one			0
but the quality of the embryos matters ; so does the woman 's age			0
a 41 - year - old with three embryos has a low chance of any one of those being normal , " but the better chance is to put three in hoping that one will take , " @entity98 said			0
you may remember how @entity132 -- aka " @entity132 " -- was criticized for not reducing the number of embryos she carried before giving birth to octuplets			0
selective reduction -- which involves aborting one , or more than one , of the fetuses -- was also a possibility for this anonymous @entity28 couple			1
in general , the decision to do a reduction for twins is extremely controversial			1
twins do n't necessarily carry high health risks to the mother or her children beyond perhaps needing bed rest and more intense care , @entity98 said			2
" we considered a reduction for about 30 seconds , " this anonymous father wrote			0
" if you thought that @entity17 involved playing god , a reduction felt beyond brazen -- machiavellian , even			1
" selective reduction is usually done between 9 and 12 weeks into the pregnancy			0
a doctor will use a needle to inject potassium chloride into the fetus , according to the @entity162			0
there is a small risk the mother will miscarry all the fetuses with this procedure			0
multiple gestation is risky for both mom and the babies , according to the @entity171			2
multiples are more likely to have developmental problems			0
moms carrying multiples are more likely to miscarry , develop gestational diabetes and to suffer from high blood pressure - related issues such as pre-eclampsia			0
fertility treatments : would you get selective reduction ? but multiples can also be a blessing			0
" you will make it work and you will love these children , " posted one commenter , who says she 's the mother of twins			2
" i wo n't lie and say that it is going to be a breeze , because it wo n't			0
but i promise you if you pull through the first year together as a team you will be the strongest kind of family there can be , and nothing can stop you from there ! "			0
