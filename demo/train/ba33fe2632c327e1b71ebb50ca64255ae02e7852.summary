-- a few days ago , i was coming home from school with a @entity5 priest			2
as we walked , he blurted out , " the smell of spring ! " we were surrounded by the scent of freshly cut grass			0
i looked around and realized that indeed spring had come ; here and there , a number of trees had begun to bud , and the lowly but beaming margarita flower was in full bloom			0
one thought immediately came to my mind : it has been a year since the election of @entity22			1
it had been raining all afternoon that day in march 2013			0
despite the bad weather , many had come to @entity26			1
as usual , there were flags from different nations , singing and shouting in different languages -- all this had always been a staple at @entity26			1
but that evening was different : people had come to see what the chimney would produce after it yielded black smoke on two earlier papal votes			0
i was with the throng , among those who were closest to the basilica			0
it was a scene of joyful anticipation			0
it was already dark when white smoke poured from the chimney , telling everyone that a new pope has been chosen			2
spontaneous applause and cheers filled the square , and then , as if it had been deliberately orchestrated , the sky began to clear and the evening became pleasant , cool and cloudless			0
then came the tolling of the bells , the entry of the army of @entity58 guards , the music played by the brass band and lights from the balcony			0
photos : the night @entity22 was chosen a few more minutes and then appeared an elderly cardinal speaking the words : " @entity70 vobis gaudium magnum @entity68 @entity67			1
" there was a momentary silence			0
the names were not anticipated : neither @entity22 , for he was not considered among the strong contenders , nor @entity22 , for no pope had previously taken that name			1
suddenly , great applause followed this short lull			0
there were roars of approval all around , shouts of " @entity83 ! " i distinctly heard a young priest affirming , " @entity22 ! oh , this is revolutionary ! " our new pope @entity22 appeared			1
after a short message and before giving his first apostolic blessing , he asked the people to pray for him , to beseech the lord to bless him , their bishop			0
a solemn silence reigned at @entity26			2
@entity22 broke the silence with his first blessing as pope			1
then he took his leave , leaving everyone with an informal " good night and sleep well ! " to this the crowd responded in jubilation			0
opinion : why pope @entity22 is so shocking that evening was auspicious			1
there were several things that kept me awake that night			0
the new pope was non-european ; he took the name @entity22 ; he bowed and asked his flock to pray for him , their shepherd ; he ended his first speech in a very candid , familiar greeting			1
and the words from the young priest : " @entity117 ! " the weeks and months that followed confirmed the charisma of this new pope			1
@entity26 is always packed with huge crowds during general audiences and the @entity122			2
like the candor in his first address , he ends every sunday gathering with " @entity127 ! " ( " have a good lunch ! " ) people are hanging on to what this pontiff says : the novelty in his words and deeds and how different groups would interpret them			0
the " pope francis effect " i took advantage of this privilege that i am in @entity141 to follow closely what this new pope has to say and what he does			2
most of the time , i take his words from my point of view as a priest , as one who is a co-worker in ministering to the people			2
in sharing my thoughts and reflection on the first year of his papacy , i also take this bias of one who has the task of shepherding			0
i see the first year of @entity22 ' pontificate as one of preaching joy and mercy			1
he told the faithful gathered at the @entity165 : " do not be men and women of sadness ; a @entity169 can never be sad ! " and perhaps this is what makes the pope an even more relevant figure in today 's world			2
under @entity22 , we would expect a revitalization of the church , that he would continue to make it closer to those in the peripheries			1
it is an echo of the action of the other @entity22 , the man of @entity183 , rebuilding the church of @entity185			1
the spring evening in which @entity22 was elected is an apt symbol of the beginning of his papacy and the years that will follow			1
perhaps it is not a mere coincidence that his pontificate coincides with the 50th anniversary of the @entity194			0
if @entity194 opened the windows for the spring air to come in , the papacy of @entity22 opens the doors for the church and her pastors to go out -- and here i would like to quote from his homily to priests on holy thursday : " may ( @entity185 ) renew his spirit in our hearts , that this anointing may spread to everyone , even to those ' outskirts ' where our faithful people most look for it and most appreciate it			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

*father* @entity216 was in @entity26 when @entity22 was elected last year
he *remembers* hearing a young priest exclaim , " this is revolutionary ! "
@entity216 reflects on @entity22 ' first year , hopes pope will lead " a revitalization of the church "
have a *personal* essay to share with the world ? submit at @entity228
