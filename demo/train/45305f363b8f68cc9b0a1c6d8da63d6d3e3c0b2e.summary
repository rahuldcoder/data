-- what happened in @entity2 today sends a chilling message to any journalist covering @entity5 : if you speak to a group whose message the government wants suppressed , you can be prosecuted and jailed for it			1
in other words , you can be imprisoned for doing your job			0
the lengthy sentences against three @entity16 journalists -- @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 -- convicted of aiding terrorists and spreading false information have shocked and angered many around the world			1
and inside the @entity2 courtroom , those closest to the accused were left reeling			2
" well , to be perfectly honest , my mind was blank			0
there was total disbelief , " @entity17 's brother @entity28 told me			1
" i ca n't comprehend the decision made by the court today			1
" @entity33 said the convicted trio were lead out of their cage shortly after the sentences were handed down			0
with no way to speak to his brother , he says he put his hand on his heart and raised a fist into the air to give @entity17 some encouragement			2
condemnation of the court 's ruling was swift			1
a @entity49 researcher , @entity48 , tweeted that even deposed president @entity50 would never have jailed prominent journalists in this way : it now appears as though no amount of political pressure or public outrage has swayed authorities in @entity5 who -- after ousting president @entity58 of the @entity59 last year -- have made it clear they will not tolerate dissenting voices			2
there is of course the fact that the three work for @entity16 , which is funded by the @entity68 government and seen as supportive of the @entity59			1
some have said the journalists are being used as pawns in a political rivalry between @entity5 's new rulers and @entity68			2
the network issued a statement shortly after the ruling , saying the verdict " defies logic , sense , and any semblance of justice			0
" the prosecution case against @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 included material from a story that was filmed when none of the defendants were even in the country			1
on another day , footage of a trotting horse was used by the prosecution			0
on yet another , music by @entity93 singer @entity92 was introduced into evidence			0
all this would be genuinely hilarious if it had n't ended in the sentences read out today by the judge			0
verdicts that mean the three journalists were led back into custody once again as prisoners in the new @entity5			0
as for what the future may hold , @entity33 told me his brother will appeal the sentence			0
" we have to maintain support for @entity17 and continue to fight for his innocence			2
" as for us journalists , should we be concerned that if we do our duty -- in other words if we speak to all sides when reporting from @entity5 -- we too will be tried , convicted and jailed for a crime we did not commit ? jailed @entity16 journalists convicted in @entity5 journalists show dismay for convictions			1

3 @entity16 journalists found *guilty* of aiding @entity59 , face 7 years in jail
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , imprisoned in @entity2 since *december*
