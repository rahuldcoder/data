@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 's president apologized friday for the gas pedal problems that have forced the recall of millions of vehicles in the @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity4 media reported			1
it was @entity14 's first remarks since the latest round of recalls began last week			1
" we 're extremely sorry to have made customers uneasy , " he told @entity4 news agency @entity17			0
" we plan to establish the facts and give an explanation that will take away the customers ' concern as soon as possible			0
" the recall is to correct a problem that , under certain circumstances , could cause the gas pedal , as it becomes worn , to stick partway down			0
@entity6 recalled 2.3 million vehicles in the @entity10 for the problem this week , although no repair procedure has been put in place			1
a @entity6 spokesman said that the carmaker is close to announcing a solution for cars in the @entity10			1
the company would still need to get regulatory approval for any proposed repair in the @entity10 and in @entity11 before a fix could be made			1
the @entity11 recall involves eight models , several of them not sold in the @entity10			1
the number of vehicles involved in that recall is under investigation , but could reach 1.8 million , @entity6 said in a statement			1
the recall is separate from one begun in november to fix a problem in which the gas pedal can catch on the edge of the removable floormat			0
the floormat recall was recently expanded to cover 5.3 million vehicles			2
in many cases , the same vehicles are involved in both recalls			2
it was not clear how many different vehicles , in total , are part of both actions			0
when it came to capturing @entity10 market share , @entity6 had its pedal to the metal for years			1
but the gas pedal problems could throw its sales into reverse			0
the halt of sales and production of the company 's most popular @entity10 models will cause this month 's sales to tumble 12 percent compared to january 2009 , according to a forecast from sales tracker @entity78			1
@entity79 , senior analyst for @entity78 , said that , if not for this week 's problems , @entity6 's sales would have been up at least slightly for the month			1
the expected drop could send @entity6 's market share below 15 percent , which would be its lowest level in nearly four years			1
most of @entity6 's rivals are expected to post higher sales compared to a year ago			1
@entity88 , which last year reported its first market share gain in the @entity10 since 1995 , is expected to pass @entity6 in market share in january , according to @entity78			1
@entity88 has joined @entity91 and other automakers trying to capitalize on @entity6 's problems , offering $ 1,000 to buyers who trade in @entity6 when purchasing a new car			1
that could be a big problem for @entity6			2
" people buy @entity6 for their bullet - proof reliability , " said @entity79			2
" that was their main selling point , and that 's taken a huge hit			0
" share ireports of auto stories even after @entity6 fixes the gas pedal problems , it is likely to have trouble regaining share , some say			2
a loss in market share this year would be @entity6 's first since 1994			1
" this is a game changer for @entity6 , " said @entity112 , head of @entity113			2
" they have some serious , serious work to do to repair the damage done to their image			0
" @entity112 said @entity6 was already vulnerable			0
his firm 's consumer survey from mid-january showed @entity6 had fallen from its long - held position of first or second in quality estimates to seventh among potential buyers			2
apparently , recalls that began late last year are having an impact			0
" this was just the latest recall problem for @entity6 , " said @entity112			2
" word of mouth is the key for all of this , and always has been			0
and it 's much tougher to move back up the list than to fall down			0
" @entity6 spokeswoman @entity134 said the company wo n't comment about any potential hit to sales or market share before its scheduled release of january sales on february 2			0
" clearly there will be a sales impact with the stopped sales , " she said			0
" really , right now our focus is working on a remedy			0
" @entity2 's @entity147 contributed to this report			0
