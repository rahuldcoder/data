every time i hear about another case of a woman breastfeeding her baby in a restaurant , department store or on a plane who is asked to cover up , head to the bathroom or leave altogether , i wonder why in 2014 we remain so incredibly uncomfortable with breastfeeding in public			1
in one of the most recent examples that garnered national attention , a mom in @entity15 says she was escorted to the bathroom at an @entity21 store when she was breastfeeding her six - week - old baby			1
outraged , she took to social media and less than a day later more than 100 women staged a " nurse - in " at the store to protest			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , was the site of another recent " nurse - in " after a breastfeeding mom was asked to cover up in a restaurant			1
in both cases , reaction was decidedly mixed			0
there were plenty who were as furious as the breastfeeding mothers and pointed to @entity39 and @entity27 laws , which allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location with the exception of someone else 's private home			1
but there were also plenty of voices in the anti-breastfeeding - in - public camp			1
" it 's not about what 's ' legal , ' " wrote one reader on the @entity51 website			0
" it 's more about what 's ' right			0
' and the effects our choices have on the people around us			0
a simple burp rag over the child and the problem goes away			0
" why at a time when celebrities bare nearly all and are celebrated for it ( for example , consider @entity68 leaving little to the imagination at the recent @entity70 ) do we as a society still seem so put off by a woman using her breasts for what they were made for ? " many times you will see more ' cleavage ' in the name of fashion than you ever would from a mom feeding her child , " said @entity76 , a breastfeeding mom of a 19 - month - old			1
let me just say right here that this is not a piece on the benefits of breastfeeding or a push to make the case that " breast is best " and encourage women to breastfeed			1
this is strictly about why the sight of public breastfeeding still makes so many people squeamish and what it will take to make breastfeeding in public as welcome as giving a baby a bottle			1
@entity103 , who lives in @entity104 and hosts a blog called @entity106 , believes people 's " uneasiness " with breastfeeding in public stems from the perception of women as sexual objects			1
" women buy into that idea , " she said			0
" if we use our breasts for anything other than ' play ' it 's not okay			0
" earlier this month , in connection with @entity123 , @entity103 joined 50 other nursing moms , members of a group called the " @entity127 of @entity104 , " for a " @entity132 " event where they nursed together in public and were joined by their families and other bystanders			1
part of the goal , says @entity103 , was to help communities support breastfeeding in public places			2
" the message is simply : nursing is normal anytime , anywhere			2
" @entity103 says she 's never been asked to leave a restaurant or store while she was breastfeeding but says it 's probably because she 's a " shy " nurser , who has been self - conscious because of people 's discomfort with breastfeeding in public			1
" sadly , it has affected me , and i 'm sure other moms have been ( affected ) too			0
" years of experience have certainly made some mothers , like @entity154 of @entity155 much more comfortable breastfeeding in public			2
on @entity158 , @entity154 shared how with her first baby , she nursed privately in the back room of her home when company was over			0
with her second , she nursed publicly but covered up			0
with her third baby , who is 2 months old , she says she " answered the door for the @entity167 guy while nursing , uncovered and did n't even notice			1
" " nursing is just something i do now , " said @entity154 , who blogs about parenting at @entity169			2
" i 'm not embarrassed or ashamed			0
when i 'm in public i do try to be thoughtful to others but i nurse whenever ( the ) baby is hungry			2
" @entity154 says she has never been asked by anyone to leave a public place while breastfeeding			2
" i 'd love to see them try ! " she told me			0
" i 've nursed everywhere from the @entity180 of the @entity181 to the @entity182 to airplanes and @entity184 dug outs and no one has said anything ! " when i asked @entity154 what she thinks it will take for us to be as comfortable with a woman breastfeeding in public as we are with a mom giving her baby a bottle in public , she said " time			1
" " i think by the time my daughter is nursing ... it wo n't be a big deal , " she said			1
@entity103 , the @entity104 mom of one , says the way to make public breastfeeding more acceptable is to make " working breasts more visible			1
" " we as moms , myself included , need to be bold and comfortable with nursing in public , " says @entity103			2
" we are n't doing anything wrong			2
if our child is hungry , we should pull our breast out just as we would a bottle			0
the breast was the first bottle			0
" @entity103 said more education is also needed			0
" as silly as it sounds , we need to educate the community on the fact that breastfeeding is indeed normal , natural and okay "			2
judgment of any mother 's feeding choice needs to stop , say moms			0
because some people 's discomfort with public breastfeeding may stem from their own insecurities about breastfeeding or a feeling that the " breast is best " crowd is passing judgment on those who choose not to breastfeed or those who ca n't			1
@entity233 , founder of @entity234 , is not uncomfortable when she sees women breastfeeding in public but believes we need to do more to support all women 's choices			2
@entity233 said she had every intention of breastfeeding but after her daughter 's birth , which was traumatic , she needed to stop breastfeeding to take medication to cope with the trauma			0
" through my personal experience i learned to be less judgmental of other parents ' feeding choices because i realized that sometimes not breastfeeding is n't even a choice ; it 's simply not possible , " said @entity233 , who has a 3 - year - old daughter			1
" i also think that women who choose formula from the start , for whatever reason , should not be made to feel guilty			0
" it 's a matter of respect			0
" women deserve the right to be in control of what we do with our bodies , " @entity233 said			0
do you think people are still squeamish about breastfeeding ? tell @entity266 on @entity267 or @entity268 on @entity158 .			1

@entity266 ca n't understand why society is so squeamish about nursing in 2014
@entity273 helped stage a " nurse - in " after she was escorted to bathroom while nursing
another mom says breastfeeding " uneasiness " has to do with views on sexuality
