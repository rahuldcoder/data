-- in 1922 a team of @entity3 explorers set off on a historic first attempt to climb the world 's highest mountain			1
they never reached the top of @entity9 , but their incredible feat of scaling within 2,000 feet of the summit was considered so groundbreaking they were each awarded an olympic gold medal			1
bowed but unbroken , climber lt. col. @entity14 made a pledge that at the very next opportunity one of the gold medals would be taken to the top of the world -- the summit his team never saw			1
almost 90 years later , that dream is finally being realized as @entity3 climber @entity23 attempts to carry one of the medals to the peak of @entity9			1
@entity0 caught up with @entity23 at base camp , where he is tweeting about his climb in real time			1
follow @entity23 's @entity31 online with less than 100 days until the @entity33 , it 's a touching tribute to the @entity3 men who captured the nation 's imagination			1
" i have a picture at home of those 1922 expedition members and they were so famous back then , " @entity23 said			1
" it was a bit like looking at a picture of the @entity45 football team			0
they were world - famous people yet they 've been lost to history a little bit			2
i wanted to bring them back to the forefront of peoples ' minds			2
" the team were forced to turn back after an avalanche killed seven @entity56 who were helping carry equipment			1
but @entity59 founder @entity58 -- often referred to as the " grandfather of the modern @entity33 " -- still awarded 21 gold medals to the expedition			1
on being handed the 1924 @entity64 medals , second - in - command @entity14 made his heartfelt pledge			1
but the vision was buried in the passage of time , and , as @entity23 points out : " then the war came along			2
" cool , who has already scaled @entity9 nine times , hopes to reach the summit in mid-may			1
" it 's such a romantic , true story , " he said			2
he admitted that even with his experience , @entity9 was still a " beast " to climb -- and a life - threatening one at that			1
" coming down is at least as dangerous if not more dangerous as going up			0
so the emotions will be welling up inside me and i know there will be a few tears , " he said			0
" @entity9 is a very different beast now to what it was in 1922			1
and of course we have all the knowledge of how to climb it			0
but it still does n't take away from the fact that @entity9 is a very dangerous mountain			1
" she 's a very fickle person and if she wants to she 'll change her outlook on things and she 'll kill people just like that			0
" however , unlike the original explorers , @entity23 will have the benefit of modern technology			1
their feat is perhaps even more extraordinary considering the clunky oxygen tanks , woolen jackets and fur hats they had for survival			0
crucially , in one of the most brutal environments on earth , none of these garments were waterproof			0
" today we get internet access , we can look at weather forecasts , weather patterns			0
we 've got state - of - the - art technology when it comes to clothing , titanium oxygen tanks , to super lightweight boots , " @entity23 said			2
" as soon as you get above 7,000 or 8,000 feet you enter the death zone			0
it 's a ticking time bomb			0
you 've got a limited amount of time which the human body can survive up there , so yes things are stacked more in our favor now than in 1922 but it 's still a mountain which deserves an awful lot of respect			1
" @entity131 , honorary archivist at @entity3 's @entity132 , has kept extensive records of the 1922 expedition			1
" they were as prepared as their knowledge at the time allowed them to be , but that knowledge was extremely limited in a lot of areas , " he told @entity0			0
" they were very well provisioned			0
they had wonderfully rich foods , nothing like you have now when you go climbing -- very heavy , very rich and totally inappropriate			0
" despite the original adventure receiving worldwide acclaim , @entity131 said it was a gallant failure , with the death of the sherpas casting a shadow over the expedition			0
" there 's actually a lot of guilt because porters were killed but none of the climbing members were , " he said			0
" a number of them said they felt dreadful about this			0
they would have felt better if at least one of them had died with the porters			0
" @entity167 , the great - granddaughter of one of the original climbers , will be following @entity23 's challenge closely			2
@entity171 had tried to scale the mountain without oxygen , but eventually had to stop his climb due to frostbite			2
he never received his gold medal after it was lost in the post			1
" to even attempt such a feat is complete madness			0
as the famous words go , they wanted to climb @entity9 because it was there			2
that is what they said was their mission , which is absolutely baffling and awe inspiring , " @entity167 said			0
" it 's a chance for everything to come back together again			2
and to fulfill what 's almost rightly theirs -- to get that final step with the medal being at the top of the summit			2
