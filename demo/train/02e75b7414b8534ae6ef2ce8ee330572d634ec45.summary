-- airports are n't exactly stress - free zones -- not yet at least			1
but it 's certainly something airport managers are working on			1
still , all the spas , yoga studios and movie cinemas in the world ca n't detract from the main source of travel anxiety : grueling lines			0
it 's an irksome feature that may soon become a relic , thanks to the advent of mobile tracking technology			1
@entity17 recently became the first in the world to track passenger movements in real time , from the parking lot to departure gates			0
" the whole idea is to get better analytics of passenger flow			0
really , it 's only because we want to know better where bottlenecks form in the airport during rush hour , " says @entity27 , vice president and chief information officer at @entity29 , which manages the airport			1
passengers can meanwhile get updates about their flight status , bookmark where they parked ( so they can find their car after their return flight ) and chart how long it will take to get through security			1
once inside , when they pass partnered shops , they can get pinged with offers			0
while receiving updates directly to one 's phone may seem intrusive , @entity27 is adamant that the system does n't collect any personal information			1
rather , it uses @entity51 and @entity53 routers to collect unique identifier numbers ( or @entity56 addresses ) , and only from devices with the @entity53 settings turned on			0
" the @entity56 addresses we use are scrambled , which means no one can be traced , " he says			0
@entity61 makes use of drone inspections @entity61 is trialing similar technology at @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity69 @entity68 airports , also using @entity70			1
the carrier is starting small -- placing the devices at baggage drop offs and security areas			2
the @entity61 app also uses the technology to alert passengers to ready their documents at key points			1
though still in its early stages , @entity81 , @entity61 's head of digital , anticipates it could have father - reaching uses			1
" in time , we could see applications supporting individual challenges , like when a customer needs to be in a different location because they are carrying skis , or are n't carrying any hold luggage , " he says			0
the @entity95 low - cost carrier has been at the forefront of utilizing the newest technology			2
in may , it started trialing inspection by drone on its fleet of @entity102 and @entity104 planes			2
the airline is also looking into the use of virtual reality glasses to allow engineers and pilots to capture pictures of potential issues , and send them directly back to base			1
" it 's another good example of how we 're applying new technologies to our business to help us be more effective and efficient , " says @entity81			0
passengers need power to opt out not everyone is comfortable with the new technology			2
" who would n't be creeped out by the idea of having your phone tracked ? if i tell you someone 's tracking you , and do n't tell you why , of course you 'd be upset , " says @entity126 , executive director and co-chair of the @entity129 - based think tank @entity128			1
he adds that , contrary to how it may seem , airport tracking is kept pretty general			1
" it 's not like it reports , ' hey , this phone belongs to the guy with blue glasses and a shabby suitcase			2
' it 's ' 38,000 devices were in this location between these hours			0
' it 's critical for airports and retailers to demystify this technology 's uses for users			2
" transparency is key , says @entity126 , and airports need to make sure to alert passengers to the when , how and why of this technology , and provide them with an option to opt out -- which both @entity155 do			1
passengers who do n't wish to be tracked can either switch off @entity53 on their devices , or provide their @entity56 address to walkbase.com and smart - places.org			0
( in doing so , the tracking systems knows to ignore the address in the future			0
) mainly , though , he recognizes the many potential uses of this technology at the airport			0
" an airport is the type of place where you probably do want to get pinged about gate changes , or find out where you can get a cup of coffee once you 're checked in , or information on where the gate is and how much time it will take to get to it , " he says			0
" it 's a big space , and anything the venue can do to help me navigate it easily and quickly is useful			0
