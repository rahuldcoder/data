@entity1 teen @entity0 , who was found dead in a rolled - up gym mat at his high school in january , died as the result of " unexplained , apparent non-accidental , blunt force trauma , " according to a newly released , independent autopsy report			1
the report , obtained exclusively tuesday by @entity8 , directly contradicts the finding of an autopsy conducted by the @entity11 that determined that @entity0 's death was the result of positional asphyxia			1
the @entity15 determined that his death was accidental			1
@entity0 , 17 and an athlete , was found january 11 headfirst in a rolled wrestling mat at a @entity20 gym in @entity21 , @entity1			1
inconsistencies in official reports on the condition of @entity0 's body have led the family and community to question the official cause of his death			1
the family 's attorney , @entity29 , has sent the independent autopsy report to the @entity32 @entity34 @entity33 , the @entity11 , the @entity32			1
attorney for @entity1 's @entity36 and @entity37 for review			1
the coroner can call a coroner 's inquest , a process that resembles a grand jury proceeding			2
after reviewing evidence and testimony , a jury would decide the cause of death , although the findings alone would have no civil or criminal consequences			1
" coroner 's inquests are not something you do every day			2
i can not tell you the last time a coroner 's inquest was done in this office , " @entity20 coroner @entity55 said			2
" i want to do the right thing by the people and the county and all concerned ; i 'm just not sure we have enough information			0
i 'm not about to refute anybody 's findings because i 'm not a doctor , " said @entity55			1
on may 1 , a judge granted the @entity71 ' request to exhume their son 's body for the purposes of a conducting an independent autopsy at their expense			2
that autopsy , conducted june 15 , found blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues , " consistent with inflicted injury			1
" it was conducted by dr. @entity83 with @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86			0
" this is unexplained -- most very , very likely inflicted , as opposed to something he caused himself , inflicted by another -- and therefore needs to be investigated as an open homicide investigation , " @entity83 said			2
" i 've never had a case that i can recall where the prosecution actually was told that this may well be a homicide -- the prosecution being the state , the police and so forth -- and then they did n't bother prosecuting			0
it 's mystifying , " he added			0
@entity83 's finding supports the narrative of the initial patient care report , written by @entity103 with the @entity104 on january 11 , the day @entity0 's body was discovered			1
that report said , " bruising noted to the right side jaw			0
" however , a january 25 report by the @entity21 - @entity109 cited " no signs of blunt force trauma on @entity0 's face or body			1
" the autopsy results released by the @entity11 may 2 identified " no significant injuries			0
" a spokesperson for the @entity11 said the agency stands by its report after reviewing the findings of the independent autopsy			2
@entity32 attorney @entity121 is reviewing the case but has not launched a formal investigation			0
" we 've been working on this for some time , " he said			0
" i 'm sure at the appropriate time , i 'll speak with his pathologist			0
" " there are some members of the community that question the result , " @entity121 continued			0
" i want to make sure members of the community and the family and everyone involved has confidence in my work and my decision			0
" the spokesperson for @entity33 has not yet responded to questions about the new report .			0
