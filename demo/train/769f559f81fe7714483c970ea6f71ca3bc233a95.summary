-- reigning champions @entity1 and @entity3 successfully began the defense of their titles at the @entity7 on monday , a day when local player @entity8 stole the show by upsetting fifth seed @entity10			1
@entity1 was the first on court , with his seven - month injury layoff making this the @entity16 's first grand slam match since being sensationally knocked out of @entity17 last year by @entity18			1
with six titles in eight finals since his return in february , @entity1 had been expected to cruise past @entity24 's @entity23 , 25			1
instead , a man seeking a record eighth title at @entity7 proceeded to do something he had never previously managed in the first round of a grand slam match - lose the opening set			1
this was unwanted history in his 34th grand slam tournament but a reminder of @entity1 's dominance in @entity36 was underlined by this being only the 15th set he had lost in 54 matches at @entity7			1
the big - hitting brands , ranked 59th , unleashed a fearless barrage of attacks off both sides and even led the second set tie break 3 - 0 only for @entity1 to claim the set en route to a 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 4 6 - 3 victory			1
" he was playing unbelievable			0
i tried to find my game and tried to resist his fantastic shots , " said @entity1 , who will face @entity49 of @entity50 for a place in the last 32			2
" he played a great match and put me in a tricky situation			0
" there were no such troubles for @entity3 who brushed @entity61 's @entity60 aside in just 54 minutes			2
surrendering only eight points on her serve , the second seed hit just four unforced errors as she set up a second round clash with @entity69 teenager @entity68			0
the @entity70 was joined in the next round by three former champions : @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
one player not expected to be joining such heavyweights was @entity50 veteran @entity78 , who finally won a grand slam match after 12 years of trying			1
the 30 - year - old produced a massive shock , knocking out local favorite and 24th seed @entity83 in a 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) 6 - 0 victory			0
after being off the tour for the last 18 months , @entity78 is ranked 1,152 in the world but made the first round after coming through qualifying			0
she will take on @entity90 in the second round , with the @entity93 player having enjoyed her greatest success when upsetting @entity95 in the first round of last year 's @entity7			2
@entity78 will struggle to beat @entity8 for local press coverage though after the wild card knocked out fifth seed @entity10 in a five - set thriller , winning 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 3 - 7 ) 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) 7 - 5 to delight a partisan crowd			1
the match took just over four hours and saw @entity8 , currently ranked no. 81 after a knee injury forced him out of the world 's top 100 , dig deep to win the fifth after losing two tie breaks that could have finished the match early			1
world no. 2 @entity109 , who withdrew ahead of the tournament because of injury , was among those impressed by the @entity93 's display against the 2010 semifinalist			2
" you got to love @entity8 , " the @entity116 tweeted			2
" great entertainer , one of the most fun guys to watch and he 's also a really good person			0
" @entity10 's defeat means that three of the world 's top 10 are no longer in contention , as the world @entity125 joined the injured @entity109 and @entity127 in being forced to watch on from the sidelines			1
a semifinalist himself in 2008 , @entity8 , 26 , faces @entity131 in the second round while fellow @entity93 @entity133 eased through with victory over @entity135			1
no @entity93 has won at @entity7 since @entity136 in 1983			2
in other notable results on monday , grand slam debutant @entity137 of @entity139 beat @entity142 veteran @entity141 thanks to a 100 % record in the tie breaks - the 18 - year - old winning 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) 7 - 6 ( 13 - 11 )			1
at one point in the second set tie break , the winner of this year 's @entity147 junior event trailed 6 - 0			0
and after sporting a new blonde hairdo during her routine defeat of @entity154 's @entity153 , @entity150 was refreshingly frank when asked what she knew about her next opponent , @entity157 @entity156			0
" to be honest , not much			0
nothing at all , actually , " the fourth seed from @entity159 said with a smile			0
" i might @entity163 her			0
'' should she beat the 22 - year - old , @entity150 may not have to do much work about her potential opponent in the third round - younger sister @entity168 , who must beat @entity169 of @entity24 first .			0
