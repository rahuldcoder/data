editor 's note : @entity2 is senior director of public relations for the nonprofit @entity4 , inc. based in @entity5 , @entity6 , and has been in the credit counseling sector since 1987			1
the @entity4 says it serves more than 2 million customers through nearly 850 offices around the country			2
@entity2 says foreclosure is more than a financial failure , it 's an emotional ordeal			1
( @entity13 ) -- when you sit across the desk from someone with overwhelming debt , you can sense their fear before a word is spoken			2
and when their home is in jeopardy , the fear fills the room			0
i was a credit counselor for 16 years , and quickly discovered that people in debt are very ashamed of their situation			1
in all my years , i never counseled anyone who was cavalier about their circumstances , or intentionally sought to dig a deep financial hole			1
but the shame that accompanies foreclosure tops anything i 've ever experienced			1
there 's something about people losing their homes that is disturbing beyond measure			1
failure has become a part of their demeanor			0
after all , foreclosure is about more than the house , and more than the money			1
it 's about losing the dream , taking your children out of their school and moving your family away from their neighborhood friends			1
pulling up roots is never easy , particularly when you 're forced to do so			0
the job of the counselor is to put the financial pieces back together , provide hope , and help move people toward a more financially stable life			1
each day housing counselors pick up the phone and advocate for their client , often going to the mat with a lender to achieve the resolution option that is best suited for that individual			1
for example , i 'm reminded of the 46 - year - old single mom 's foreclosure problem that started with a heart attack			1
out of work for three months with no income and medical bills compounding her existing debt , she was headed for foreclosure			1
she and an @entity4 certified housing counselor were able to work out a loan modification that not only kept her in her home , but also reduced her monthly mortgage payment			1
housing issues are complicated , with the terms short sale , forbearance agreement , deed - in - lieu and loan modification foreign to the consumer			1
but such resolution options are all part of a day 's work for the housing counselor , whose goal is to determine the best long - term solution for the consumer			0
their experience allows them to " talk the talk " with the lender and often achieve the happy ending that everyone is after			1
each case is individual , with outcomes as varied as the problems , but avoiding foreclosure , where appropriate , is the goal of all parties			1
foreclosures happen for many reasons , some of which are beyond the borrower 's control : economic hardship related to job loss , reduced hours at work , medical issues or divorce ; unaffordable payments when a loan resets to a higher annual percentage rate ; buying a house that was more costly than the borrower 's income could reasonably support long - term , and increased cost of living , which places more demands on consumers ' budgets , forcing them to make hard choices about which debts to pay			0
of course , the best foreclosure prevention tool is making an educated and informed decision when buying a home			2
pre-purchase counseling is particularly useful for first - time buyers , helping them understand the full responsibility of homeownership			2
however , once it becomes apparent that buyers can no longer keep up with their loans , it is critical for them to reach out for help right away			0
postponing dealing with the mortgage delinquency is one of the main impediments to solving the problem			0
delinquent homeowners likely will receive a notice to @entity156 that lists @entity158 housing counselors they can contact , as well as hardship program options			1
they should seek help at once			0
many resolution options such as a short sale -- in which the home is sold for less than the remaining mortgage amount and the lender accepts at least part of the loss -- are only open to those who have not dug a deep financial hole			2
these solutions do not preserve homeownership , but they are less damaging to the consumer 's credit history , and depending on their structure , could possibly allow the consumer to leave the home owing little or nothing at all			2
when homeowners in trouble reach out to lenders , few know that they need to speak to the loss mitigation department , and not the collection area			2
once contact is made , buyers should be sure to keep records			0
keep a log of the date and time of each call , the person with whom you speak , and the content of the conversation			0
ask questions and restate to make sure you are understanding information			0
without accurate documentation , any dispute could turn into a " he - said / she - said " with the homeowner being the loser			0
do n't expect a quick answer			0
follow up with your mortgage company to make sure any paperwork you sent was received and logged			0
in many cases , getting a yes or a no can take weeks , and weeks can feel like years when saving your home is involved			0
as i write this , it seems as though new proposals to help consumers avoid foreclosure appear daily			2
whether it is actions by @entity219 , the @entity220 or the lenders themselves , solving the mortgage crisis is recognized as an essential component to getting the economy back on track			0
any resolution is likely to be as complex as the problem itself			0
exotic loan products , combined with making them secure , are far different from yesteryear when we went to our community bank and took out a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage that it held the full term			0
homeownership can still be the @entity239 dream , but only under the right circumstances			2
lenders are returning to more traditional lending standards , and with good reason			0
buyers are realizing that what seems too good to be true is often exactly that			0
@entity239 will find solid footing , but until then , many feel as though their home was built on shifting sands			0
let 's redefine financial success , and this time have it represent living within your means , being able to pay bills in full when the statement arrives , understanding the terms of a loan or credit card , knowing that there are things more important than hocking your financial peace of mind for a larger house or shinier car			1
in other words , let 's begin living the true @entity239 dream , one of financial responsibility that is celebrated by all			1
it 's a dream we can make come true , one household at a time			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : foreclosure is an emotional process for families
credit counselors can help homeowners get modified payment terms , she says
@entity2 : families need to budget realistically and cut *spending*
she says financial responsibility is a dream people can achieve
