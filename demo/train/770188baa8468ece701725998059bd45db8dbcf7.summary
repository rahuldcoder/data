editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 , is the @entity4 professor and chair in the global health department at the @entity7 and professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at @entity13 's @entity12			1
@entity14 is a native of @entity16 and was executive director of the @entity18 of @entity16 from 1992 through 1996			1
dr. @entity2 says @entity20 and @entity16 authorities deserve credit for their responses to the swine flu outbreak			1
@entity24 , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) -- the swine flu outbreak that started less than a month ago has caused more than 150 deaths in @entity16 and more than 60 confirmed cases across the @entity20 , @entity30 and the @entity31 , with suspected cases in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
it is clear that a new virus has emerged that is different enough that the population 's previous exposure to influenza viruses and vaccines do not provide immunity			2
so far , public health authorities are meeting this challenge with strength and preparedness			0
the @entity16 and @entity20 federal governments deserve credit for their thorough responses			1
the major control strategy that has been implemented in @entity16 is social - distancing , a range of nonquarantine measures that attempt to reduce contact between persons , such as closing schools , canceling cultural and sports events , and closing museums and parks			2
in addition , countries are strengthening surveillance , releasing antiviral stockpiles and issuing travel advisories			0
in the @entity20 , federal officials are working closely with and providing guidance to state and local public health authorities , who have to make decisions about whether to close schools or prevent other large - scale gatherings			2
the cross-border nature of this outbreak is a strong argument for why the @entity20 should cooperate with and support competent institutions of government in other countries , even during a period of economic uncertainty			1
the first case of swine flu in the @entity20 during the current outbreak was identified in @entity85 by part of a surveillance program connected with the @entity88 there , which only began monitoring influenza in 2005			1
in this program , physicians collect nasal swabs from patients at community clinics on both sides of the border			0
only when @entity98 scientists sent a suspect sample to the mass spectrometer did they discover the new variety of swine flu , according to an article describing the techniques in @entity105			1
why have mortality rates been higher in @entity16 ? and how should preparations for the regular flu season later this year be modified ? reports from @entity16 that the virus has primarily struck otherwise healthy young adults are alarming because seasonal influenza typically affects the very young and very old			2
still , preliminary genetic analysis shows that the virus strains isolated from patients in @entity117 are identical to those seen in severely ill @entity16 patients			2
it is possible that some of the patients in @entity16 , many of whom are dying of pneumonia , are succumbing to secondary infections			2
medical historians believe that a large proportion of those who died of the @entity129 in 1918 were not killed by the flu virus , but by secondary bacterial pneumonia , which was difficult to treat before the introduction of antibiotics			2
thus , enhancing vaccination against pneumonia may prove to be a critical strategy in decreasing influenza mortality during future outbreaks			0
additional investigation of those who have died is however , urgently needed to determine the best response strategy			0
an issue that keeps coming up is the idea of closing the @entity20 - @entity16 border			1
already at various border crossing points , customs authorities are having people who appear sick taken to a secondary inspection area for further evaluation			0
more systematic monitoring at border crossing and airports such as mouth swabs has been proposed			0
is that a good strategy ? i would argue that it is not			0
the @entity20 - @entity16 border is one of the busiest in the world with millions of people and goods crossing each day			1
many items that we routinely use in the @entity20 are produced in @entity16 and closing the border would have a crippling effect to the @entity20			1
for example , in the event of a serious flu outbreak in this country there would be a need for mechanical ventilator deployments to hospitals			1
the national stockpile has sufficient ventilators , but the necessary circuits that are needed to operate them are not produced in the @entity20 but in @entity16 , so having them come across to this country is critical for taking care of critically ill patients in the @entity20			1
the second issue is how to prepare for the coming flu season			0
during the flu pandemic of 1918 , cases began in the spring and then faded away during the summer , only to come back with a vengeance in the fall and winter			0
thus , we need to be prepared for an even worse outbreak of swine flu this winter and should not declare victory too soon			1
considerable evidence has accumulated that the practice of producing seasonal vaccines in chicken eggs is cumbersome and sometimes ineffective			0
there is an urgent need for the development of more modern techniques of vaccine production			0
the @entity200 has been putting its research resources into the fight			0
in 2007 , the @entity200 created six @entity203 , located at @entity13 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
sunday 's emergency declaration signaled for these centers to devote their resources to monitoring and responding to the swine flu outbreak			1
researchers at these centers have developed alternatives to chicken eggs and new delivery methods			0
now is the time to put these alternatives to the test , so that countries around the world are fully prepared for the coming flu season and future outbreaks			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

dr. @entity2 : @entity20 and @entity16 have responded well to swine flu outbreak
he says cross-border cooperation is *crucial* to *successful* battle against flu
key question is why @entity16 's illnesses have been more deadly , he says
@entity14 : one factor may be presence of pneumonia in those who died
