@entity0 -- the founder of a @entity4 company that made breast implants linked to a major health scare has been charged by police investigating the scandal			1
@entity9 , former boss of @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , faces charges of involuntary injury over the now - defunct firm 's use of substandard ingredients in its implants			1
so what is wrong with the implants ? what are the risks ? and what is being done to help those affected by the scandal ? what is the problem ? implants made by @entity4 's @entity10 ( @entity10 ) were banned in 2010 , after it was discovered that they contained industrial - grade , which has more contaminants than the medical - grade gel they should have used			1
@entity33 is reported to have admitted authorizing the use of two gel formulas at @entity10 : a high - end version for wealthier clients , using @entity39 - made medical silicone , and a " house " formula for everyone else			1
this was made from cheap industrial silicone , meant for use in mattresses , allegedly in order to cut costs and boost profits			2
in december 2011 , authorities in @entity4 sparked a worldwide alert when they advised 30,000 @entity4 women who had been fitted with the potentially defective implants to have them removed			1
the implants are believed to have a higher than normal incidence of rupture , though exact figures on this differ : @entity4 authorities put the rate at 5 % , but in @entity61 it is thought to be around 1 % , in line with industry standards			1
@entity65 plastic surgeon dr. @entity64 told @entity1 the health risks of industrial - grade silicone remained unclear			1
" the @entity10 industrial silicone has many contaminants , " he said , but he added : " we 're not sure just how many ... we ca n't be sure what can go wrong			1
" we know there 's an increased incidence of inflammation ; we 're not certain of other health risks , but we certainly have concerns about cancer and other toxic exposures			0
" authorities in @entity4 and @entity61 have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants but have said that in case of rupture they could cause inflammation , scarring and fibrosis			1
where in the world were they used ? @entity10 was once the world 's third largest supplier of implants -- 300,000 women in 65 countries around the world are thought to have had them fitted , both for cosmetic reasons and in reconstructive surgery following treatment for breast cancer			1
the implants were widely used across @entity97 -- 40,000 women in @entity61 are affected -- and @entity99			2
@entity10 silicone implants were never licensed for use in the @entity39			1
@entity61 @entity10 implant recipient @entity102 , told @entity1 she was worried about the potential impact on her health			2
" it 's like a ticking time bomb inside me , " she said			0
" when you go to the doctor , you do n't say ' who makes your medicine ? ' -- you just assume it 's going to be safe			0
to think that i 've got mattress silicone inside me , and @entity113 knows what else they used , it 's disgusting			0
" what advice is being given to women who had the implants fitted ? the advice given to women with @entity10 implants has varied widely from country to country			1
@entity4 has urged all of those with the implants to have them removed immediately as a precaution			1
in @entity130 , authorities have also recommended the precautionary removal of implants			2
the @entity61 government says there is no evidence to recommend the routine removal of @entity10 implants , though it says women who are concerned should be able to have them removed			1
@entity139 medical groups have recommended that women seek the removal of their implants , but that there is no immediate danger			2
@entity64 argues that women who have had @entity10 implants should not wait until they rupture to have them removed			1
" waiting until an mri is positive is like saying wait to run for cover until after a bomb goes off			0
if you know something is going to happen , you would try to remove the risk			0
" i think it is incumbent on all women , regardless of their government 's stance , to recognize that they have a flawed , defective silicone product in their chest , and they have a shell that is containing it that is also flawed -- they need to remove these implants , or remove and replace them			2
" and what is being done ? the @entity4 government has offered to pay for the removal and replacement of all @entity10 implants fitted in @entity4			1
@entity130 has said it will cover the cost of implant removal , but not their replacement			0
in the @entity61 , women who had their implants paid for by the @entity174 ( @entity174 ) will be able to have them removed free of charge , after consultation with their doctor			2
the @entity61 government says it expects companies that fitted implants privately , for cosmetic purposes , to offer the same deal			0
bioethicist @entity183 told @entity1 it made financial and ethical sense for governments to pre-empt any potential health issues by removing the implants now , rather than waiting to see if they cause problems			2
" if these things do turn out to be nasty , and do cause health problems , the bill for that is going to be big , and every government that has a nationalized system is going to pay , so it may be smarter , just on prudential grounds , to take them out now , avoiding what could be a huge financial disaster down the line			0
" on the whole , i think it makes more sense , ethically and in terms of economic risk , to get these things out at public expense			0
" what is the company 's response ? @entity10 went bankrupt in 2010 , after its implants were banned			1
its founder , @entity33 , is under investigation by @entity4 police			2
on thursday , he was charged with involuntary injury over the implants			1
but @entity10 's lawyer , @entity218 , told @entity1 that while industrial silicone was used in its implants , no tests had shown them to be a danger -- instead he insisted the problem was fear			1
" several things have heightened this fear : the advice and care given to victims , doctors who did n't want responsibility and pushed the problem onto @entity10 , and the intense media pressure			0
" @entity218 also says there is no money for compensation for victims			0
" unfortunately the company has already been liquidated			0
no one can expect any money to come from @entity10			0
" will the scandal have a lasting impact ? concerns over @entity10 implants have led some to call for greater regulation of the plastic surgery industry			2
" if it 's going in your body , if it 's a pill , if it 's a medical device , it should be regulated by the government , " said @entity183			0
" the consumer ca n't tell what 's safe , what is n't safe , what 's made according to good manufacturing processes			0
" i think you have to have government watching over anything that people put into their bodies for a medical or a health purpose -- i do n't buy the idea that it 's just buyer beware			0
" the bioethicist said the scandal also showed the need for plastic surgery charges to include insurance against problems that may arise in future			0
" for elective procedures ... it would make sense to make part of the charge some kind of coverage or insurance if things go wrong , if there turn out to be adverse events , " @entity183 told @entity1			0
" national health systems do n't want to pay for purely elective cosmetic procedures , so you 're going to be stuck if something does turn out to be fraudulent or just misused , and instead of turning to lawyers , it might make better sense to build some insurance into the system			0
