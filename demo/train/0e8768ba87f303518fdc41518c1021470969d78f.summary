-- could another zoo in @entity2 kill a giraffe named @entity4 ? to some animal lovers , it sounds too terrible to be true , but zoo leaders say it 's anything but a tall tale			1
just days after the @entity11 killed a male giraffe named @entity4 to avoid inbreeding , another zoo said it might follow suit			1
@entity15 said thursday it may also have to " euthanize " one of its male giraffes -- coincidentally , also named @entity4 -- if a female is brought in to breed			1
zoologist @entity20 told @entity0 that @entity15 joined the same breeding program as the @entity11 last year , which means it ca n't have too many giraffes with the same genetic makeup			1
the zoo currently has two male giraffes , he said			0
one , @entity4 , is not deemed useful to the program but is a useful companion to the genetically valuable second giraffe , which is in fact an older brother of the @entity4 killed in @entity31			1
the zoo wants the second giraffe to mate , so it must bring in a female giraffe			2
" at the moment , they are doing very well and are keeping each other company , but if there are some genetically more valuable giraffes in the program that need the space , we have to decide what to do with him , " said @entity20			2
" we will of course try to place him in a suitable zoo , but if that is not possible , we might have to euthanize him			2
the program will give us notice well in advance , so i think we will have a good chance of placing him			0
" it 's thought that no decision is imminent , " so the problem is not acute , " he said			2
death threats the killing of the @entity11 's @entity4 opened wide divisions between animal lovers and zoo officials concerned about maintaining the genetic diversity of giraffes in the program			1
staff at the zoo received death threats as debate raged online over the killing , which took place despite a petition signed by thousands of animal lovers			1
but @entity72 , executive director of the @entity73 , a @entity75 body governing 345 institutions , said those protesting were missing the point			0
" i 'm afraid that when we have limited space in zoos -- and it 's limited because of problems in the wild , of course , and more and more animals need our help -- then we sometimes have to make these really tough decisions , " he said			0
' surplus problems ' @entity90 , scientific director at the @entity11 , told @entity0 the decision was made for the greater good of the giraffe population			1
" our giraffes are part of an international breeding program , which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes , " he said			0
" it can only be done by matching the genetic composition of the various animals with the available space			0
... when giraffes breed as well as they do now , then you will inevitably run into so - called surplus problems now and then			0
" the @entity11 's @entity4 was shot by a veterinarian with a rifle as he leaned down to munch on rye bread , a favorite snack			2
after a necropsy , the giraffe was dismembered in front of an audience that included children and fed to the zoo 's lions , tigers and leopards			0
@entity0 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0

@entity15 says it may also have to euthanize a giraffe called @entity4
it will be necessary only if space is needed for a new giraffe and a home can not be found
animal lovers were outraged when @entity11 killed another giraffe named @entity4
no decision imminent at @entity15 , which will *explore* all *options* , a zoologist says
