-- for about 13 minutes , @entity1 sat at the top of its @entity4 soccer group , ahead of the mighty @entity5 and star - powered @entity6			1
with seconds left to play , @entity8 set up a header for his teammate @entity10 , leaving the final score tied at 2 - 2			0
it was a harsh blow for the @entity13 , but it does not end their @entity4 dreams -- it just makes them harder to achieve			1
with every team in @entity18 now having played two matches , most groups now have clear winners and losers			0
but not @entity23 theory , any of the four teams in the group of @entity5 , the @entity13 , @entity24 and @entity6 could still qualify for the knockout round			1
here 's how it could work for the @entity13			2
it plays @entity5 , the group leader , on thursday			0
third - ranked @entity24 plays @entity6 at the same time			0
if the @entity13 beats @entity5 : the @entity13 qualify for the knockout stage			1
@entity1 would get three points for the victory , giving it seven			2
no other team in the group can match that , so the @entity13 go through to the next stage			0
is that likely ? it 's possible , but it 's not likely			0
@entity5 is the no. 2 - ranked team in the world , and it has n't lost a game yet this @entity4			1
the @entity13 have n't lost a game either , though			0
if the @entity13 ties with @entity5 : both teams go through to the knockout stage			2
each would get a point for the draw , giving them five points each			0
no matter who wins the @entity24 - @entity6 match , neither team can end up with more than four points			0
is that likely ? the odds are n't bad			0
@entity24 held @entity5 to a draw friday , proving that it can be done			0
@entity5 and the @entity13 have each won one and drawn one			2
if the @entity13 loses to @entity5 : it 's bad , but even that 's not necessarily game over			1
@entity5 would definitely finish at the top of the group , and second place would depend both on how badly the @entity13 lose and what the margin of victory is in the @entity24 - @entity6 game			1
if the two teams draw , then the @entity13 come in second place			2
if @entity6 wins by a narrow margin , @entity1 still comes second in the group and goes through			2
but if @entity24 wins by two or more , it 'll be the @entity75 and not the @entity13 who advance -- making this the third @entity4 in a row where @entity24 eliminates @entity1			1
monday 's matches @entity18 and @entity78 advanced to the @entity79 with victories monday while the @entity82 ' win over @entity83 gave it the top spot in its group and the @entity87 second place			1
@entity18 continued its undefeated streak at home , cruising past hapless @entity90 4 - 1 and earning the top spot in @entity91 @entity92 § Ã £ o will face @entity83 on saturday in the @entity79			1
the @entity82 , which downed @entity83 2 - 0 in @entity93 , will face @entity78 , 3 - 1 winners over @entity95 , on sunday			1
already - eliminated @entity96 avoided total embarrassment monday by cruising past @entity98 3 - 0			0
here 's a quick catch - up on which teams have already qualified for the knockout stage and which ones can not : through : @entity18 @entity78 @entity82 @entity83 @entity103 @entity104 @entity105 @entity106 out : @entity95 @entity96 @entity98 @entity90 @entity107 @entity108 @entity109 @entity4 schedule of matches @entity0 's @entity112 contributed to this report .			1

sunday 's tie with @entity6 makes it more difficult for @entity1 to achieve its @entity4 dreams
the @entity13 secure a place if they beat or draw with @entity5
@entity82 tops @entity93 with victory over @entity83
new : @entity18 , @entity78 advance to the @entity79 with *convincing* victories
