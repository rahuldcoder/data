-- fear is a terrible thing to waste			1
yet modern @entity3 have squandered it as a tool for managing burgeoning populations of wildlife			1
a woman is in the hospital after she was mauled by a bear while walking in her central @entity12 neighborhood on monday			1
authorities caught a 75 - to 100 - pound yearling , but think the larger predator bear is still on the prowl			1
@entity17 thinks black bears have a people problem			1
he 's a state wildlife biologist once responsible for dealing with growing bear - vs. - people conflicts in central @entity12			1
i spent time with @entity17 while researching the book " @entity23			0
" he explained that perpetually hungry black bears need plenty of food habitat			0
parents disown yearlings , forcing them to find new space			1
as their populations grow , they spread out , often from the @entity31 south into the swampy sprawl of @entity33			0
trouble starts when a bear turns up in a backyard			1
instead of scaring it away , too many people say : " oh , is n't he cute			1
let 's toss him a cookie			0
" thus begins a photo collection of " @entity45			0
" but it 's the beginning of the end for that bear , because the people are teaching it to associate the smell of people with food			1
the bear comes back for more			1
soon it 's breaking into the house			0
the people call 911 : " do something about your bear			1
" @entity17 arrives , darts the bear and moves it 100 miles			1
but the bear has learned people equals food , and does it again			1
after three strikes , the bear is shot -- euthanized			1
but it 's not the bear 's fault			2
it 's the people 's fault			2
deer are eating our gardens and spreading ticks that cause lyme disease ; coyotes are killing our pets ; turkeys are chasing our children to school ; and geese have overrun our soccer fields because they do n't fear us			1
and we have done all sorts of things to help them lose their natural fear			1
people say our conflicts with wild creatures are our fault because we encroached on their habitat			1
true , but only half the story			0
many species encroached right back			0
why ? because our habitat is better than theirs			0
ours can sustain many more of them than their un-peopled landscape			0
we put out all sorts of food for them : lawns , gardens , shrubbery , birdseed , grill grease , garbage , dumpster waste			0
we offer water : air - conditioner drip pans are water fountains for raccoons			2
edges and hiding places are homes : a coyote can have a litter of pups in that brush behind your garbage and you wo n't know it			0
and we offer protection from predators , mainly ourselves			0
the results are mounting in people - vs. - wildlife conflicts			1
we should be celebrating a conservation success story that is unique on the planet			0
instead , we demonize elegant creatures and fight over what to do , or not to do , about too much of a good thing			0
how did this happen ? how did we turn this story into such a mess ? in a nutshell : over the last century and half , forests grew back on abandoned farmland ; a century ago we ended commercial hunting and began restoring wild bird and animal populations			2
since @entity140 we sprawled out into suburbs and exurbs -- something early conservationists did n't imagine			0
the 2000 census showed that for the first time , an absolute majority of the population lived neither in cities nor on working farms but in the vast sprawl zone in between			0
that 's where family farms were a century ago			0
today , it 's full of trees and filling with wildlife			2
we 've become forest people -- yet we spend 90 % of our time indoors			2
there we get most of our nature on digital screens , where wild creatures are often portrayed as pets performing all sorts of antics			2
research suggests that the white - tailed deer 's biggest predator since the last @entity169 has been man			1
but sprawl man has largely gotten out of the predation business			0
he does n't hunt and does n't want others to hunt around him			0
he 's peppered the landscape with hunting restrictions and enacted all sorts of laws against hunting , firearms discharges , even bow - and - arrow use in some places			2
what this means is that in just the last few decades , for the first time in 11,000 years , huge swaths of the whitetail 's historic range -- the @entity186 -- have been put off - limits to its biggest predators			2
no wonder deer have burgeoned out of control			2
in @entity194 , for example , it 's illegal to discharge a firearm within 150 feet of a hard - surfaced road or within 500 feet of an occupied dwelling without the occupants ' written permission -- often not easy to get			2
those two laws alone put almost two - thirds of the state effectively off - limits to hunting			2
lots of states have similar restrictions and most were imposed in the name of safety			0
guns kill 31,500 people annually in the @entity186 , but hunters are relatively safe			1
estimates say about 100 people die in hunting accidents , mainly in cases of mistaken identity			1
these days , deer kill more than twice that many , both in deer - vehicle crashes and when drivers swerve into a tree or an oncoming vehicle			1
these accidents hospitalize another 30,000 people			1
do n't swerve : hit the deer			2
@entity227 white - tails , meanwhile , do enormous damage to the landscape , and not just gardens and shrubbery			2
they are ruining our forests by eating their understories so trees ca n't regenerate			0
no places for understory birds and the insects they feed their newborn			0
black bears are shy and docile creatures motivated by hunger and fear , but they , like deer , beavers , turkeys , waterfowl and others , were almost wiped out in the @entity186 by the end of the 19th century			1
@entity254 and @entity255 reportedly killed 155 of them in one season in @entity258			0
with protection , they slowly came back in the 20th century , to about 750,000 in 2002 and perhaps a million or more today			0
between 1900 and 2009 , black bears killed 63 people -- 86 % were in the last 40 years			2
why the increase ? more bears and more denatured people living in the same habitat			0
birdseed sellers now refer to wild birds as " outdoor pets , " helping to condition people to think that putting out food for wild animals is an act of kindness			1
@entity275 and no fear have turned many normally nocturnal wild creatures diurnal			1
they hang out among us in the daytime			0
nuisance wildlife control people say tossing rocks at coyotes would help reinstill their fear of people			1
instead , i 've known people to toss them dog biscuits			0
carrying a stick or a golf club is enough to deter wild turkeys , mail carriers tell me			0
@entity294 - proofing your garbage cans and taking down your birdfeeders in spring are no - brainers			0
conflicts between people and wild animals will continue to rise as both populations grow into one another			1
there are all sorts of ways to mitigate them , both lethal and nonlethal			0
some work better than others			0
reinstilling their fear will help			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity313 .			1

@entity313 : wildlife more and more encroaching on our space , and we into theirs
a bear mauled a woman in @entity12 neighborhood ; deer - vehicle accidents kill
@entity313 : conflicts between people and wild animals will rise as they lose fear of us
we *indulge* them , he says , but we should be reinstilling their fear
