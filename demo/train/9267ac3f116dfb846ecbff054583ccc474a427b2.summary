@entity1 prime minister @entity0 is not a subtle man			1
when he has an objective in mind , he is not above resorting to hyperbole , exaggeration , or apocalyptic scenarios to make his point			2
he has been crying wolf nearly as long as he has been in politics			1
for a very good reason : it works			2
unlike the boy in the story who lost credibility when he sounded the alarm one time too many , each new iteration by mr. @entity0 is greeted with nods of grave concern			1
the latest edition of this long - running show was his appearance on " @entity26 " on sunday			2
more than 20 years ago , mr. @entity0 solemnly informed us that , unless someone intervened , @entity28 would have a nuclear weapon within five years			1
that was one of the origins of the " three to five year " mantra			0
almost every year since the early 1990s , senior political figures , intelligence specialists and respected commentators have assured us that @entity28 would surely have a nuclear weapon in three to five years , sometimes less , unless @entity28 were forced to stop its mad dash for the bomb			1
it is not hard to understand the logic of this assertion			0
@entity1 itself managed to develop a nuclear weapons capability in absolute secrecy in only a few years			1
@entity48 , @entity49 , even poor @entity50 with virtually no heavy industrial base , managed to develop nuclear weapons in secret within a decade or so of the decision to launch a determined program			0
by most accounts , @entity28 decided to restart its nuclear program -- started under the shah and interrupted by the @entity28 revolution -- in the mid- 1980s , nearly 30 years ago			1
this anomaly is almost never mentioned			0
@entity28 , endowed with a robust industrial base , exceptional engineering universities , a well - educated population , and a core of @entity66 - trained nuclear scientists , has spent nearly three times as long on its nuclear program as other countries that were far less endowed			2
it still has no nuclear weapon			0
why ? one answer may be the consensus of all @entity74 intelligence services that the leaders of @entity28 have not taken a decision to build a bomb			1
they have openly constructed the nuclear infrastructure that would permit them to do so , but they have not taken a decision			0
mr. @entity0 did not mention that in his tv appearance			2
instead , he was digging up his talking points from another crisis point in the past			0
last sunday , referring to @entity28 , he commented in his usual understated fashion that " all the problems that we have ( in the @entity90 ) will be dwarfed by this messianic , apocalyptic , extreme regime that would have atomic bombs			2
it would make -- a terrible , catastrophic -- change for the world and for the @entity74			2
" his prescription : the @entity74 " should ratchet up the sanctions and make it clear to @entity28 that they wo n't get away with it			1
and if sanctions do n't work and they have to know that you 'll be prepared to take military action , that 's the only thing that will get their attention			0
" some 10 years ago , mr. @entity0 was invited to testify before the @entity105 concerning the prospective threat from @entity108 's @entity107 and how to deal with it			1
at that time he assured the @entity110 that " every indication we have is that ( @entity108 ) is pursuing , pursuing with abandon , pursuing with every ounce of effort , the establishment of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear weapons			0
" if anyone makes an opposite assumption or can not draw the lines connecting the dots , that is simply not an objective assessment of what has happened , " he said			0
" @entity108 is hell - bent on achieving atomic bombs , atomic capabilities , as soon as he can			0
" he went on to advise : " if you take out @entity108 , @entity108 's regime , i guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region			0
" mr. @entity0 badly needs a new set of talking points			2
at about the same time that he was appearing on " @entity26 , " a group of 29 former @entity74 officials sent a letter to president @entity137 offering an alternative vision of the situation in @entity28 today and how to deal with it			1
i was one of the signatories			0
it reads : " the election of @entity144 to be @entity28 's next president presents a major potential opportunity to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff over @entity28 's nuclear program			1
we strongly encourage your administration to seize the moment to pursue new multilateral and bilateral negotiations with @entity28 once @entity144 takes office and to avoid any provocative action that could narrow the window of opportunity for a more moderate policy out of @entity160 ... " diplomacy will only succeed if we are prepared to leverage existing sanctions and other incentives in exchange for reciprocal @entity28 concessions			1
further , in the leadup to @entity144 's inauguration , it is critical that all parties abstain from provocative actions that could imperil this diplomatic opportunity			2
" another letter to president @entity137 , sponsored by rep. @entity173 , @entity174 , and rep. @entity175 , @entity177 - @entity176 , urges him to " pursue the potential opportunity presented by @entity28 's recent presidential election by reinvigorating @entity74 efforts to secure a negotiated nuclear agreement			1
" it has attracted support from more than 90 members of the @entity185 , including many @entity186			0
this is a crucial moment			0
a new president of @entity28 will be inaugurated in less than three weeks			1
we have a choice between the frayed talking points of the past , which point only toward a third @entity74 war in the @entity90 , or toward a newly energized diplomatic initiative that offers the @entity28 leadership a way out of the strategic dead - ends of the past			1
there is no certainty that diplomacy will work			0
but the failure to try would be the true policy defeat .			0

@entity205 : @entity1 leader @entity0 has been crying wolf on @entity28 nukes for 20 years
sick : he predicts that @entity28 will soon unleash an apocalypse , wants @entity74 to get tougher
but @entity74 intelligence services believe that @entity28 has not decided to build a bomb , he says
sick : the new @entity28 president offers opportunity to revive talks and resolve issue
