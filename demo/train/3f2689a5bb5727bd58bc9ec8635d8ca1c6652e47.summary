-- the religious leader behind plans to erect an @entity4 center and mosque a few blocks from @entity7 's ground zero said wednesday night that @entity9 's national security depends on how it handles the controversy			1
" if we move from that location , the story will be the radicals have taken over the discourse , " @entity11 told @entity0 's @entity12 on " @entity13			1
" " the headlines in the @entity20 world will be that @entity4 is under attack			2
" the imam , who repeatedly said his mission was to promote peace and build a bridge among faiths , said he was also speaking about " radicals " on both sides of the debate on the @entity4 center			1
" our national security now hinges on how we negotiate this , how we speak about it			2
" " the battlefront is between moderates of all sides ... and the radicals on all sides , " he said			2
moving the project to another location would strengthen @entity44 radicals ' ability to recruit followers and will likely increase violence against @entity9 , the imam said			0
@entity11 said that " nothing is off the table " when asked whether he would consider moving the site			1
" we are consulting , talking to various people about how to do this so that we negotiate the best and safest option			0
" the imam told @entity12 " had i known [ the controversy ] would happen we certainly would never have done this			1
" asked if he meant he would not have picked the location , @entity11 said , " we would not have done something that would create more divisiveness			1
" worry over what some observers have termed " @entity70 " has been heightened by a @entity68 , @entity69 , church 's plan to burn copies of the @entity62 on saturday , the ninth anniversary of the 2001 attacks on @entity7 and @entity65			1
@entity11 said he hopes the church reconsiders			1
" it is something that is not the right thing to do			0
" " with freedom comes responsibility , " he said			0
" this is dangerous to our national security and is also the un-christian thing to do			2
... @entity81 said to love your enemy			0
we are not your enemy			0
" responding to a poll showing 71 percent of @entity7 oppose the center 's location , @entity11 he was going on television to explain his background and vision			1
" i want to show them my face			0
show them my track record			0
" the imam spoke of " a vision i 've had for almost 15 years ... to establish a space that embodies the fundamental beliefs that we have as @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity20 , which is to love our @entity105 and to love our neighbor -- to build a space where we have a culture of worship			0
" @entity11 said he would continue speaking with families of those killed in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said			0
opposition goes against " the fundamental @entity9 principle of separation of church and state , " said @entity11 , adding he has been surprised by the controversy			1
the project , known as @entity121 , is slated to include a variety of facilities , including a prayer room , a performing arts center , gym , swimming pool and other public spaces			2
it is planned for a site two blocks from the @entity132			1
a source familiar with @entity121 told @entity0 's @entity134 last week that the structure is being planned as an 11 - story building			2
it will cover 120,000 square feet -- 10,000 feet of which would be designated for the @entity20 prayer space			0
the developer is considering the possibility of an interfaith education / meditation / prayer space as well , the source said			0
opponents of the plan to build the center say it is too close to the site of the terror attacks and is an affront to the memory of those who died in the @entity153 strike			1
backers cite , among other things , first amendment rights and the need to express religious tolerance			0
those who know @entity11 describe him as a thoughtful man , a bridge builder who seeks to unite all faiths but who wo n't parse words when he sees religion used for nefarious ends			1
but he has landed in controversy before			2
he has chided the @entity9 for killing civilians in @entity169			0
he said in 2005 that the @entity9 had more @entity20 blood on its hands than " @entity153 has on its hands of innocent non-muslims			0
" he has refused to accept @entity176 governments ' designation of @entity177 as a terrorist group			0
shortly after the 9/11 attacks , he told @entity181 ' " @entity180 " that " @entity9 policies were an accessory to the crime			0
" earlier this week , @entity11 wrote a commentary published online by the @entity186			1
" i have been struck by how the controversy has riveted the attention of @entity9 , as well as nearly everyone i met in my travels , " @entity11 wrote			1
" we have all been awed by how inflamed and emotional the issue of the proposed community center has become , " wrote @entity11 , who had just returned from a @entity193 - sponsored @entity192 trip to promote @entity9 - @entity20 relations			1
" the level of attention reflects the degree to which people care about the very @entity9 values under debate : recognition of the rights of others , tolerance and freedom of worship			0
" @entity12 is the host of @entity0 's " in @entity9 " series that covers untold stories in underreported communities .			2
