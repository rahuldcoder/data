@entity0 -- a controversial congressional hearing thursday on the radicalization of @entity4 touched on sensitive questions involving terrorism and tolerance a decade after the 9/11 attacks			0
at times emotional and theatrical , the four - hour session of the @entity10 included calls from moderate @entity12 for support in overcoming extremists seeking to indoctrinate their children , as well as protests from @entity18 legislators who complained the hearing unfairly implicated all @entity12 for the criminal acts of a small minority			2
in the end , committee chairman @entity22 , @entity25 - @entity24 , said the hearing that generated widespread media coverage " actually went a lot easier than it could have			1
" he blamed what he called the " mindless , baseless hysteria in the media " in preceding weeks for the controversy , and promised additional hearings in coming months , with the next perhaps focusing on the radicalization of @entity12 in @entity38 prisons			1
despite strong criticism from @entity4 and accusations of a @entity42 revival , @entity22 started the hearing by defending it as neither " radical or un-american			1
" " to back down would be a craven surrender to political correctness and an abdication of what i believe to be the main responsibility of this committee to protect @entity38 from a terrorist attack , " he said			1
recruiting young @entity38 @entity12 is part of @entity55 's strategy to continue attacking the @entity38 , said @entity22 , who called on @entity38 to reject the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , a prominent @entity12 - @entity38 advocacy group in the @entity38			1
witnesses stressed to the panel the need for more understanding of the issue , with a father describing how his son was radicalized by @entity65 extremists , and a moderate @entity12 activist advocating an @entity38 form of @entity65 that believes in " separation of mosque and state			1
" at the same time , the only law enforcement official to testify , sheriff @entity71 of @entity72 in @entity73 , seemed to sum up the overall approach needed by calling for increased understanding by @entity38 of their changing society			1
" the truth is that @entity38 is becoming a society of the world , and because of that we have to be sensitive , we have to know how to work with various communities , " @entity71 said			2
" @entity38 need to wake up and start learning more about all the issues that affect their well - being			2
... the real truth is that the @entity38 public must step up to the plate and do more , even if it 's just educating yourself			2
" evidence of the deep public divide over the issue included a woman in the public gallery wearing a t - shirt that had " @entity95 " written in large letters			0
democrats on the panel sharply criticized @entity22 for focusing the hearing only on the @entity12 - @entity38 community , with some expressing outrage and other making emotional pleas			1
rep. @entity103 of @entity24 called the hearing " great theater " but lamented the lack of a definition for terrorism and radicalization			2
for example , she said , parents in her district tell of chidlren being recruited and brainwashed by local gangs			0
rep. @entity115 , the first elected @entity12 member of @entity116 , choked up in describing the sacrifices of @entity4 , among them @entity119 , a 23 - year - old paramedic and @entity24 police cadet who died trying to save others in the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
with @entity119 's mother in the room , @entity115 teared up as he explained that people " falsely speculated ( @entity119 ) was with the attackers because he was @entity12			1
" " his life should not be identified as just a member of an ethic group or just a member of a religion , but as an @entity38 who gave everything for his fellow @entity38 , " the sobbing @entity115 said			1
he acknowledged that some @entity12 are responsible for violent acts , but said blaming the entire @entity12 community for the evil of individuals is " the very heart of stereotyping and scapegoating			1
" @entity4 called the planned series of hearings an unfair attack on loyal citizens and a dangerous break from the traditional @entity38 embrace of tolerance and pluralism			1
however , the president of the @entity151 told the hearing that the radicalization of @entity4 is a " significant " problem that only the @entity136 can resolve , instead of claiming victimization when concerns are raised			0
" we can close our eyes and pretend it does n't exist , " said dr. m. @entity157 , who is @entity12			2
" you 're not going to solve the problem and the problem is increasing exponentially			0
" @entity157 called radicalization " a moral corruption within a certain segment " that is using the @entity65 religion to spread its message			2
countering such efforts would require teaching @entity4 about @entity38 principles of liberty and " separation of mosque and state , " he said , with a goal of allowing true @entity12 reformists to gain a voice in the debate , instead of what he called @entity65 revivalists clinging to traditional models that mix religion and government			1
noting the controversy over addressing the issue , @entity157 said " i hope that you develop the political will to deal with this problem			0
" critics have accused @entity191 leaders of bigotry and compared the hearings to those held in the 1950s to explore sen. @entity197 's allegations of @entity199 infiltration in the early years of the @entity200			0
@entity18 rep. @entity201 , the longest - serving congressman and the dean of the @entity10 , said he represented a @entity204 community that included a sizable @entity12 population			1
" they are almost , without exception , honorable , loyal citizens , " @entity201 said			0
" and as i 've indicated , they are distressed as much as we are about the behavior of @entity55 and other threats to their nation as we are to sharing their concerns about what is of danger to our nation			0
" @entity201 then told the committee that in all the years that he headed investigative committees , he kept a picture of @entity197 hanging on the wall -- " so that i would know what it was i did not want to look like , to do or to be			0
" rep. @entity223 , @entity224 , told the committee that the hearings run the risk of taking too narrow a view of the scope of terrorism threats against the @entity38 and could stoke a climate of fear and distrust in the @entity12 community			1
" as we consider the possible domestic effects of our actions , we must also consider the possible effects abroad , " @entity223 said			0
" as i look at the recent uprisings in @entity238 and the @entity239 , i 'm struck by the fact that these movements are inspired by secular notions of democracy and freedom			0
@entity245 seems to be on the sidelines			0
" other democrats were more dramatic			0
rep. @entity248 of @entity249 expressed her " outrage " at limited scope of the hearing , while @entity73 rep. @entity253 called it " discriminatory " and " an abuse of power " by @entity22 , who became committee chairman with the @entity191 takeover of @entity116 in last november 's elections			1
@entity253 questioned why other @entity10 committees were n't holding hearings on threats to @entity38 children involving other religions , a veiled but obvious reference to the sex abuse scandal in the @entity266			1
rep. @entity267 of @entity249 called for a hearing on the @entity269 , noting it was religious - based because all members were required to be @entity272			0
@entity191 offered their own theatrics , with rep. @entity274 of @entity275 expressing his own outrage over what he called the @entity280 administration 's " failure to single out who our enemy is			0
" witnesses invited by @entity22 told stories of personal loss			2
@entity286 , the father of an @entity38 youth who converted from @entity288 to @entity65 at age 19 and later shot two @entity38 army troops outside an @entity292 recruiting station , asked the committee for help			1
@entity286 blamed @entity65 extremists for radicalizing his son @entity296 at mosques in @entity298 , @entity299			2
@entity296 changed his name to @entity301 and was held responsible for the 2009 fatal attack on an @entity303 killing in @entity304 , @entity292			0
" we are losing @entity38 babies			2
our children are in danger			0
we must stand up and do something about the problem , " @entity286 said			0
" i 'd like to see something change that no other family in this great country of ours has to go through what our family is facing today			0
what happened to @entity296 at those @entity298 mosques is n't normal			0
" later , @entity286 seemed perplexed by criticism of the hearing by @entity18 , saying they did n't understand the reality of the problem or appeared fearful of political ramifications			0
to @entity71 , the sheriff , part of the problem stems from distrust between @entity12 communities and local law enforcement in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity38			1
he described successful outreach by his department to minority communities that have brought cooperation in criminal investigations , and called on @entity12 parents to notify authorities at the first sign of irregular behavior that might signal radicalization of a child			2
@entity22 complained about a lack of cooperation from @entity12 organizations and @entity12 - @entity38 communities , and he and rep. @entity346 , @entity347 , took direct aim at @entity56 , which was a harsh critic of the hearing			1
@entity346 said the group was " counter-productive and it is hurting the @entity4 community , " accusing it of waging " a campaign to intimidate and silence anyone who raises concerns about @entity12 radicalization			1
" @entity157 also criticized @entity56 , saying it and other well - known @entity12 groups emerged from and represented the more traditional elements of @entity65 , rather than the majority of @entity4 who had a more secular world view			1
@entity22 told @entity1 he had increased security because of the anger generated by the hearings , describing threats he is getting as a " combination of things			2
" he already had security protection with him at home in @entity24 following the shooting of rep. @entity373 , @entity374			0
@entity1 's @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity380 and @entity381 contributed to this report .			0
