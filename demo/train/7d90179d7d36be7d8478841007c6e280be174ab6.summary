-- at least one corner of the solar system may be serving up an ice - and - water sandwich , with the possibility of life on the rocks			1
@entity10 researchers , publishing in the journal @entity8 , have demonstrated that this " club sandwich " phenomenon may be happening on @entity13 , the largest moon in the solar system and a satellite of @entity16			1
this finding means that life could have even arisen on @entity13			1
the study suggests there may be a layer of salty water directly on top of @entity13 's rocky core			1
chemical interactions between rock and water could lead to the formation of life , scientists say			1
" this is good news for @entity13 , " said lead study author @entity31 of @entity10 's @entity32 in a statement			1
" its ocean is huge , with enormous pressures , so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean			0
when we added salts to our models , we came up with liquids dense enough to sink to the sea floor			0
" the oceans of @entity13 may have 25 times the volume of @entity50 's oceans , scientists said			1
but @entity13 is also smaller ; it has an average radius of 1,634 miles , about 41 % of @entity50 's			1
there is only a handful of places in the solar system thought to have subsurface oceans			1
there is strong evidence that @entity61 , another moon of @entity16 's , and @entity63 's moons @entity64 and @entity65 have oceans under ice as well			1
@entity16 's moon @entity68 is also a contender			0
data from @entity10 's @entity72 spacecraft suggested last month that @entity64 has an ocean at least the size of @entity75 under its ice layer			0
signs of underground ocean found on @entity79 @entity31 and colleagues did not visit @entity13 , obviously , but they performed laboratory experiments here on @entity50 to simulate what would happen to ice and salty water on the @entity16 moon			1
they showed that the density of liquids goes up with the presence of salt under extreme conditions inside moons such as @entity13			2
because salt ions attract molecules of @entity97 , liquid water becomes denser when salt is added			0
there are many forms of ice , which makes modeling conditions on icy moons complex			0
you are probably most familiar with @entity104 , the ice that floats in a soda fountain beverage because it is lighter than water			0
but ice molecules get packed together more tightly at high pressures , @entity31 said			0
in deep oceans , the dense ice would actually be heavier than water , plummeting to the ocean floor			2
@entity31 and colleagues use @entity114 to refer to the most dense and heavy ice that @entity13 may have			2
on this moon , however , scientists believe the saltiest liquid would be so dense that it would be at the very bottom , above the rock			2
computer models taking all of that into account suggest that @entity13 has as many as three ice layers with liquid ocean between them			2
the models also suggest that ice could form in the seawater -- a process that leaves heavy salts to fall down and lighter ice to float up -- an upward snow effect			0
in the middle of the layers may be slush from that ice that then melts			0
scientists do n't know if this model is correct , of course			0
senior author @entity139 , also of @entity10 's @entity32 , said in a statement that the " sandwich " model reflects a stable state , but there are various reasons why the moon might not achieve this structure ; it may even alternate between a " club sandwich " phase and a structure with fewer layers : light ice , ocean , high - pressure ice			0
@entity155 discovered @entity13 as well as three other moons of @entity16 in 1610			2
these moons contributed to the knowledge that our sun and other planets in our solar system do not orbit the @entity50 , but rather the solar system revolves around the sun. we may learn more about @entity13 and other moons with the potential of life through a space mission called @entity169 , or @entity169			1
the mission , being developed by the @entity171 , will visit @entity61 , @entity68 and @entity13			2
it is scheduled to launch in 2022 .			0

@entity13 's oceans may have 25 times the volume of @entity50 's
life may arise from chemical interactions between water and rock , scientists say
@entity13 is one of several moons in our solar system that may *support* life
