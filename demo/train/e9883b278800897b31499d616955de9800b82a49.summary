@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 refugees in @entity1 's @entity0 thought life could n't get much harsher			1
but that was before winter storm " @entity7 " moved in			1
the rain and snow have since made things even more miserable			2
scenes of despair are all around : one young girl , sockless and in slippers , trudges through the snow gathering what 's left of it for water			2
later , she 'll need it to cook with			0
across the road , huddling close to the makeshift tents that will barely keep out the rain , let alone protect them from the cold , three teenage boys describe the appalling conditions they 're living in			1
" there 's nothing for us to get warm with , " @entity26 tells me			2
he 's from @entity31 and is wearing nothing more substantial than a hoodie			2
his friend @entity34 , also from @entity31 , adds : " we need heating appliances			0
we need winter clothes for the kids			2
the adults can take the cold , but the kids ca n't , " he said			0
aid workers have been quick to mobilize , fanning out across the hardest hit areas in @entity1			2
according to the @entity45 's @entity44 ( @entity46 ) , the @entity47 , the @entity46 and their partner ngos have been able to speed up the distribution of additional emergency shelter kits - including plastic sheets , timber and tools - to thousands of refugees living in tents in the @entity0 , eastern @entity1 , so far the region most affected by the storm			1
the @entity45 says that they too are being hampered by the poor conditions			0
emergency teams are dealing with blocked roads , and they say , alternate shelters are being prepared			0
@entity62 : refugees brace for snow " for the hundreds of thousands of refugees in @entity1 , as well as those in neighboring countries and the displaced in @entity4 , a storm like this creates immense additional hardship and suffering , " said @entity65 , @entity46 's @entity66 and @entity68 bureau director			1
" with @entity1 's help , we 're doing everything we can to get rapid additional help to people who most need it			1
" but the refugees in this particular makeshift camp in the @entity0 tell me help has n't come fast enough			1
they say they 're still waiting			0
close by , adults chop any firewood they can as children , many of them with nothing but slippers on their feet , try to distract themselves from the cold			0
some , like sister and brother @entity91 and @entity92 , from @entity93 , crave the remnants of a childhood long forgotten ; they make the most of the frosty conditions by building a snowman			0
for others though , the needs are more basic : they seek warmth and food			0
according to the @entity46 , @entity1 is the largest @entity4 refugee - hosting country in the region , with 838,189 @entity4 refugees either registered as refugees or awaiting registration			1
so , that means that the country of @entity1 , with a population of just over 4 million , has now grown to over 5 million people due to the growing number of refugees			1
and , that number is climbing			0
the @entity46 says that , unlike other countries neighboring @entity4 , there are no established refugee camps			1
instead people are living in the community in nearly 1,600 different areas			2
indeed , one of the biggest problems faced by @entity4 who 've escaped the war at home and come to neighboring @entity1 is that the @entity1 government wo n't allow for the construction of official refugee camps			1
despite continued requests from aid organizations , @entity1 political leaders are too fearful that camps for @entity4 will become permanent , just as camps for @entity136 refugees , who began escaping to @entity1 in 1948 , did			1
as the sun begins to set over the ramshackle tents , more fear is setting in			0
one of the worst winters on record has only just begun			0
for these desperate souls , the night ahead will be darker and colder than ever .			0

winter storm " @entity7 " has brought snow and rain to @entity1 's @entity0
region is home to thousands of people who have fled the civil war in @entity4
one out of every four people living in @entity1 is now a @entity4 refugee
many are living in makeshift camps , with little but flimsy tents to keep out the cold
