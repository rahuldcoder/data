-- as " faster than real time " technology capable of predicting our every move is discussed at @entity7 in @entity8 this week , it seems prudent to ask whether such developments will actually improve our lives			1
always - connected apps and platforms currently have us texting , networking and even talking to @entity13 while driving			2
as if that was n't bad enough , we 're unveiling applications that not only know where you are now , but where you 're probably going next			0
they 'll also guess what you 'll buy while you 're there and who you 'll most likely be talking to			0
thankfully , our overmedicated and undisciplined youth are predicated to thrive in this information overloaded , attention deficit disordered world , so most do n't see any problem with more data , features and apps			1
@entity30 threatens to ' @entity31 up ' the human race but at some point , someone will have to draw the line			0
unfortunately , if we do n't start paying attention to the social and legal implications of this technology , that duty will fall to the government			1
and who thinks that will work out well ? as @entity45 of digital advisory firm @entity46 wrote recently , store clerks could soon be using facial recognition and online influence scores to help them prioritize who needs help			0
but tell a politician that his or her score on @entity54 , the social media influence ranking website , may prioritize the attention they get from a voter -- or even the level of service they receive from a bartender -- and let 's see how many injunctions get filed by the end of happy hour			1
fast - forward to the anticipatory software of the future			2
i imagine someone is already building an app that scrapes location - based data to tell marketers where you 'll eat next and who will be with you			2
i do n't think this exists yet , but the brilliant brains behind today 's start - ups will come up with it soon enough			1
in the digital age , everyone is becoming a spook at what point does this real - time and " faster than real time " push become creepy ? and when it does , who will step in to say : " okay , let 's not get carried away ? " it will probably happen in @entity93 before it does in the @entity94 , where lax privacy regulations reign			1
but should n't it be tackled sooner rather than leaving it until it triggers a heavy - handed response			2
if it 's left to parliament in the @entity103 , @entity104 in the @entity94 or legislators in other countries -- democratic or not -- then we are setting ourselves up for disappointment			0
whenever preferential treatment to one set of people , governments usually intervene			0
but surely playing favorites with race , sex , and religion is a far cry from the marketing segmentation delivered by " faster than real time " technology ? or is it ? the real - time technology of today is already frightening for some , although it is becoming less so as the over sharing of personal data becomes culturally more acceptable			1
but this notion of " faster - than - real - time , " while fascinating , may predict a much darker , more orwellian future			1
we do n't want you to get carried away			0

@entity7 's " faster than real time " theme refers to *precognitive* tech that can predict our *choices*
youth thrive in an information - overloaded world and do not see problems coming , says @entity141
@entity141 asks , what are the social and legal implications of predictive technology ?
