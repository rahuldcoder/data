when mr @entity1 , a 39 - year - old furniture factory owner came down with flu symptoms late last year , he was n't worried			1
according to his family , the man , who worked in @entity5 in southern @entity6 , had always been healthy			2
weeks later , he was on a ventilator			0
hospitalized for about 20 days , he slipped into a vegetative state and later died , his family said			0
he was diagnosed as having @entity11 virus , a new strain of avian flu that jumped from birds to humans for the first time last year , said his close cousin , who requested not to be identified			1
" i could n't believe it , " she said			0
" how could this happen to him ? it all came so suddenly to a healthy person			0
" in recent weeks , @entity6 has seen a spike in cases and experts are worried that infections will gather pace as the country celebrates the @entity28 this week - a peak time for travel and for poultry sales			1
fresh wave ? since the strain was first reported in @entity35 in february 2013 , it has affected 246 in mainland @entity6 , according to @entity37 's @entity36			2
the @entity38 says that 56 have died from the disease			0
the number of cases faded after may , but returned in late 2013			0
like all flu strains , @entity11 cases increase during colder months			1
in january alone , 19 deaths and 96 human cases have been reported , according to figures from the @entity47 cited by state news agency @entity48 on monday -- rivaling the initial wave of @entity11 cases seen in march 2013			1
cases have also been reported in @entity52 and in @entity37 , which on tuesday began culling 20,000 chickens after a sample of live chicken imported from mainland @entity6 tested positive for @entity57 viruses			1
according to the @entity38 , most of the human cases were exposed to the @entity11 virus through contact with poultry or contaminated environments , such as live bird markets , " when the chickens are very overcrowded , at the time of festivals like @entity73 , @entity28 , and there are no bio-security measures taken , then the virus spreads through poultry very quickly , " said @entity66 - @entity65 , chair of infectious diseases at the @entity68			1
" it 's also possible that travelers will bring live poultry back to their own villages , " he added			1
the @entity38 does not plan to issue a special advisory ahead of the holiday , said @entity84 , a spokesman with the organization			0
" further sporadic human cases are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas , especially given expected increases in production , trade and transport of poultry associated with the upcoming @entity28 , " the @entity38 warned			1
the @entity28 is one of the biggest annual human migrations on the planet as most @entity28 travel to spend the nearly two - week holiday with their families			2
' stringent measures needed ' the @entity11 virus appears deadlier than the seasonal flu , but less virulent than another bird flu strain , @entity102 , with a crude 30 % mortality rate , said @entity65 , who has worked on major outbreaks including @entity105 and @entity102			1
he said the key is to implement sanitation measures at the live poultry markets			1
he drew parallels of the current situation in @entity6 with the first case of @entity102 , which appeared in @entity37 in 1997			2
the @entity37 government implemented rules such as requiring regular cleaning of transport cages , mandating a rest day when no live poultry would be allowed at the marketplace and ordering all unsold birds at the market to be killed in the evening			1
@entity65 said such measures are crucial to avoid the spread of the virus			0
" there will be an increasing number of cases in the coming february to may unless the mainland government takes more stringent measures to stop this spread , " @entity65 said			2
live poultry trading has been halted in three cities in the hardest - hit province of @entity132 in eastern @entity6 , @entity48 reported			1
and in @entity35 , the live poultry trade will shut starting january 31 to april 30 to prevent spread of bird flu , according to @entity48			1
however , not all @entity11 patients have had close contact with live birds , including the case of @entity1 , whose cousin said his closest poultry contact was eating chicken at a restaurant			1
on january 19 , a 31 - year - old @entity35 doctor died , marking the first medical worker death from the strain			1
the doctor , according to @entity48 , appeared to have limited exposure to poultry or a contaminated environment ,			2
infection of health care workers is closely watched because it might indicate human - to - human transmission in a medical setting			0
" sometimes we just do n't know the source , " said the @entity38 's @entity84			0
not having exposure to poultry does n't equate human - to - human transmission , he added			0
@entity11 does not appear to transmit easily among humans , according to the @entity38			2
loved ones suffer family members who 've seen their loved ones suffer from @entity11 describe a long , harrowing illness , that resembled pneumonia			2
@entity165 's 57 - year - old father , who lived in eastern province of @entity132 , was diagnosed as having @entity11 after developing a 104 degree @entity168 fever in november			2
" he , at first , felt cold and had a fever and later , his oxygen level in his blood dropped to 40 per cent , " said his daughter @entity165			0
his family struggled to transfer him to a bigger hospital			0
when they did , it took several days to confirm that he had @entity11 , she said			0
" we could n't stop crying , " said @entity165			0
" but we had to wipe away tears , and told my dad that he was ill , but assured him that he would recover , but needed to suffer a little because the needles could hurt			0
" " my father then said : ' it 's ok			0
