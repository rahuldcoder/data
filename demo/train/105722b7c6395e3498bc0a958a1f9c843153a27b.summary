-- @entity1 claimed @entity3 's first medal at the @entity4 with gold in saturday 's men 's cycling road race			1
much fancied home favorite @entity8 finished a disappointing 29th as the @entity11 team struggled to meet pre-race expectations			1
@entity14 's @entity13 took the silver , while bronze went to @entity17 from @entity18			1
the 38 - year - old @entity1 , who served a two - year ban for blood doping between 2007 and 2009 , announced after the race that he may retire from the sport after wednesday 's cycling time trial			2
" i will still race in the time trial on wednesday but i have the gold medal i wanted and after that i will consider retiring , " said the @entity3 cyclist			0
world champion @entity8 had been strongly tipped to finally claim the @entity30 medal that had eluded him at the @entity31 in @entity32 , where he was the only member of @entity11 's track cycling team to return from the games without a medal			1
despite the @entity11 team having control of the peloton throughout the race , they struggled to close the gap on the lead group and @entity8 was nowhere in sight as @entity1 out sprinted @entity13 to the finish line in front of @entity45			2
" there was a group of 22 who got away and we could n't pull them back , " said @entity8			0
" i can be proud of how the lads rode			0
they have got nothing left in the tank			0
@entity8 's hopes appeared to have been boosted when rival @entity56 sprinter @entity55 crashed , but the peloton could not close on the leading group			0
with just under 10km to the finish line -- and a handy time advantage of 50 seconds -- the leading pack looked to be preparing for a sprint finish , but @entity13 made a break for it , and surprisingly @entity1 was the only rider to respond			2
as the two riders rounded the final corner , the @entity3 made the most of his rival slowing to look back to check for pursuers and launched a sprint to the line			0
it was quickly clear that the @entity14 had no answer to the @entity3 's attack and @entity1 had a big enough lead to ride across the line with his arms aloft .			1

@entity3 's @entity1 wins gold
@entity14 @entity13 claimed silver , @entity18 's @entity83 bronze
world champion @entity8 finishes a disappointing 29th
