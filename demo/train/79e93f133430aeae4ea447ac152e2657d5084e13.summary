-- it 's happened again			2
another actress apparently forgot she was n't wearing any underwear when exiting her limo in front of throngs of paparazzi			1
the result : " wardrobe malfunction			1
" followed , of course , by a ton of free publicity for the actress and her new film			2
we 're talking about @entity16			1
at monday night 's @entity19 premiere of " @entity20 , " the 30 - year - old star got out of her vehicle in a way that flashed to the paparazzi " the @entity23			1
" and next thing you know , she 's making the headlines			2
c'mon , let 's be honest : are these " malfunctions " really accidents or just calculated ploys by celebrities to garner attention ? are we being played for idiots , or do celebrities suddenly fall out of their clothes more often than the rest of us ? in the case of @entity16 , it seems that the incident was probably a mistake			1
she told the press that she was " devastated " by the mishap			2
certainly , she has no history of these types of antics			2
and she is well - respected in @entity48			0
in fact , on thursday , she received a @entity51 nomination for her performance in " @entity20			1
" although you would think that since @entity16 was exiting her car sans underwear , she would do so more carefully than a cowboy climbing off a horse			1
especially since she was being dropped off on the red carpet where the paparazzi were lined up like piranhas awaiting a piece of meat			0
they live for stuff like this			0
there 's no doubt that being a celebrity is challenging			0
celebrities have to constantly stay in the limelight			1
if they 're out of sight , they 're out of work			0
this is true for even those who have been very successful			0
just this week , @entity74 -- a popular actress who recently married @entity75 -- complained about losing out on several movie roles she desperately wanted , including the part in " @entity20 " that went to @entity16			1
the answer for some celebs is simple : do whatever it takes to stay in the public eye			1
" any press is good press " is the adage they live by			0
you do n't have to look far for examples of this philosophy			1
@entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , along with their wardrobe malfunctions , drunken tirades , " accidentally " leaked sex tapes , etc. then there are celebs like @entity99 and @entity100 who wear outfits that appear to be intentionally designed wardrobe malfunctions , from see - through blouses to bathing suit tops slightly bigger than a 50 - cent piece			2
they do this all in front of paparazzi all too happy to accommodate their desire for attention			2
the queen of manipulating the press is @entity114			0
there are no " malfunctions " with @entity114 ; it 's all by design			0
this summer , during her concert in @entity120 , she flashed the audience her right breast			0
a month later during her @entity124 show , she flashed the audience her left breast			0
@entity114 's strategy is truly impressive : her breasts yielded two different stories , one for each breast			0
believe it not , there are celebrities that have not resorted to these tricks to stay relevant			1
they are able to remain famous and work continually without such extracurricular activities			1
we have yet to hear about @entity137 flashing her breasts on the @entity139 show			0
or @entity140 inadvertently having a part of his anatomy fall out of his pants			0
we have n't even seen pictures of people like @entity146 or @entity147 with their zippers accidentally undone			2
as long as celebrities feel the pressure to remain famous , there will be wardrobe " malfunctions			1
" but calling them accidents in many cases is just laughable			2
they are simply more creative press releases			0
it could always be worse			0
one day you could pick up the newspaper and discover @entity161 has had a wardrobe malfunction revealing to us all : " the @entity164			1
" the thought of that makes me appreciate @entity114 's breasts -- both her left and her right one -- that much more			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

@entity16 had a " wardrobe malfunction " at a premiere of " @entity20 "
@entity172 : are we being played for idiots that these incidents are accidents ?
he says as long as stars feel the pressure to remain famous , they *'ll* court attention
@entity172 : but there are some who do n't resort to these tricks to stay relevant
