-- a large pop - up box will greet @entity3 users logging on to the social - networking site on thursday , asking them to modify their privacy settings			1
the company says the changes will help streamline privacy controls that have confused many of its 350 million users and were sprawled over six separate pages			2
what is getting the thumbs - down complaints have started flowing in , focusing on three areas : the changes treat as " publicly available information " the following : your name , profile picture , current city , gender and networks , and the pages you 're a fan of			2
until now , you had the option of restricting much of that information			2
that option has been removed			0
the ramifications , as the nonprofit @entity30 sees them : " for example , you might want to join the fan page of a controversial issue ( like a page that supports or condemns the legalization of gay marriage ) , and let all your personal friends see this on your profile , but hide it from your officemates , relatives or the public at large			2
" you can not do so now			0
the foundation says : " these changes are especially worrisome because even something as seemingly innocuous as your list of friends can reveal a great deal about you			0
in september , for example , an @entity55 study nicknamed ' @entity57 ' demonstrated that researchers could accurately predict a @entity3 user 's sexual orientation simply by examining the user 's friends list			1
" @entity3 counters that a user 's friends list can be made nonviewable			1
but it is either viewable by all or by no one			0
another source of consternation is @entity3 apps , such as the quizzes developed by third parties that many users are fond of taking			1
until now , @entity3 provided an option so you could specify that your information not be shared with others when one of your friends adds such an app. but now , whenever a friend adds an app , your " publicly available information " becomes accessible to the developer			1
so why did @entity3 undertake the changes ? the @entity85 explains it this way : if a user retains the " everyone " option , the information is accessible by the web at large			1
" in short , this is @entity3 's answer to @entity94			1
... that means @entity3 can leverage it for real - time search , and can also syndicate it to other places , like @entity101 and @entity102			1
the feature has been available in the site 's privacy settings since last summer , but most people did n't use it ( and probably did n't even know it was there )			1
the new privacy launch today puts this as the default option for many users			2
" the changes have met with mixed reaction			0
by early thursday , more than 2,700 users had approved of the changes on the @entity3 blog			1
but about 700 people said they were unhappy			0
" the new setting [ s ] are ridiculous , " commented user @entity121 @entity120			0
" i have less control than before and my friends are visible to everyone ... i ca n't hide them ... but i have no choice ... because if i select only friends ... then no @entity129 ! " what is getting the thumbs - up the most commended aspect of the new settings is that they allow users to micromanage who can access every bit of information on the site			1
one way to do so is to separate your friends into lists and grant those lists varying levels of accessibility			0
for example , if you would rather your bosses not know what you do on downtime , you can place them on a specially created list			0
in addition , a user can specify accessibility post by post			2
after each status update you type or photo you post , you can pick from a drop - down menu whether you want that item visible to everyone , to just your friends , or to friends of friends as well			2
how to access the changes the new controls will be available under the " settings " link at the top right of every page , in addition to being available in the dialogue box			0
for each section -- profile information , contact information , applications and search -- users will be asked to pick from three options about who can access the information : friends , friends of friends , or everyone			2
the changes do away with " regional networks , " which let users designate themselves as residents of a geographic area			0
but @entity3 is retaining school - and company - based networks			1
it is worth noting that many users will find their privacy options set at " recommended settings " by default			1
if you retain those , your information will be available to everyone			0
if you would rather the site not share your information publicly , you will need to click through each section and restrict it to " friends " only			0
this applies for photos as well			0
a user will have to specify album by album how much access to grant others			0
in addition , you will have to go under " search " and specify whether you want @entity3 to make your information available to users who look for you on @entity3 and on the @entity215 .			1

pop - up on thursday asks @entity3 users to change their privacy settings
some users *dislike* how much information is made public to *non-friends* unless they make changes
more popular is the new ability to *decide* on every post who gets to see it
blog calls the changes " @entity3 's answer to @entity94 "
