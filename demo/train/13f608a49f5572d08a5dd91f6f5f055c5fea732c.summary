@entity0 -- televisions are getting wider and thinner , their edges shrinking to make room for displays that pack in more and more pixels			0
but the real evolution of the tv set is n't taking place with the glossy hardware			0
major tv manufacturers , including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , announced their latest television sets this week at the @entity19 here			1
they all had variations on the same splashy hardware features that were previewed last year -- @entity24 and @entity25 screens , more inches ( 60 , 85 , 110 ) -- but now they 're closer to being available on consumer products			1
however , it 's the smaller , tablet - inspired features that could end up being more enticing to average consumers			1
these include improved software interfaces , internet connectivity and social integration , tablet and smartphone pairing , apps and more options for content sources other than cable			1
the new @entity41 screens have four times the number of pixels as standard @entity44			1
on its own , @entity24 is n't a compelling reason to upgrade unless you are a video buff , especially since you would have to sit extra close to the set or have an enormous tv to notice the difference between @entity41 and a lower - resolution screen			1
price tags are still sky high for these top - of - the - line @entity44			2
@entity16 said its 55 - inch @entity53 -- @entity25 stands for organic light - emitting diode , a technology that provides a crisper picture than most other displays -- will cost $ 12,000 when it arrives in the @entity58 in march			1
there 's also a very limited amount of content in the new pixel - heavy @entity24 format , though more will likely be churned out in the coming years			2
more in demand now are features for the growing number of users who want to watch tv on all their screens , big and small , and pull from a large selection of content options , not just the cable feed and their dvr			1
5 fun and off gadgets from @entity19 these are some of the popular new software features from this year 's crop of televisions at @entity19			1
many of these new options are already available with less expensive set - top boxes and game consoles that can be paired with your existing tv : smartphone - like interfaces we spend so much time swiping around intuitive smartphone interfaces that navigating through tv menus feels like a harsh trip back in time			2
manufacturers are making big efforts to update their user interfaces to be more intuitive			0
some models are even running the @entity98 - based @entity97 platform , which aims to simplify channel browsing			0
@entity15 showed a revamped , busy interface called the @entity101 that will appear on its next generation of smart @entity44			0
it is divided into five sections for live tv and recommendations , streaming content , media stored on the computer , social features and apps			1
one new feature retailers will love is @entity112 , which will serve up shopping information for the products and outfits you see in your regular tv shows			0
the new @entity120 set has a customizable home screen and voice commands			0
streaming content and recommendations in 2013 , having hundreds of mediocre channels to choose from is n't enough			0
and dvrs are limited in their own right			0
these days people want the option to stream content and order video on demand from @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and other sources			1
smart tvs are adding support for these web - based services			1
for example , @entity15 is adding a way to search multiple content sources at once , similar to @entity143 and @entity144			1
there 's also been a lot of buzz at @entity19 about tvs that offer tailored recommendations			1
some feature built - in " assistants " that track your viewing habits and then tell you what other shows you might also like to watch , much like @entity134 does with its delightfully odd categories			2
death of the boring remote the @entity159 buttons are n't much use when you 're bopping between @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity133 and photos of your last vacation			0
tv makers are adding new ways to navigate between these , including gestures and voice control			2
it 's a little bit @entity171 , a little bit @entity174			0
tv makers also are making apps that can turn tablets and smartphones into remote controls for your set			0
@entity16 's latest @entity182 , announced on monday , acts like a mouse , letting you navigate a pointer around the tv screen by moving the remote			2
it supports voice - recognition commands and lets you switch channels by waving the remote around to spell out numbers			0
@entity15 's televisions also add more gesture controls so you can zoom in and out on photographs or swipe through the many panes of its new interface			0
more screens one giant screen is n't enough for many modern viewers			2
smartphones and tablets have become popular as second - screen devices for people who multitask while flipping channels			1
just open @entity207 during any major televised sporting event to see how people are using a second screen to share commentary about the action			1
viewers want the option to start an episode of " @entity216 " on the big tv in the living room and finish it in bed on a tablet			2
services such as @entity134 and @entity133 are already multiscreen , offering streaming video on mobile devices , computers and even your tv through devices such as @entity227 and @entity228			0
now smart tvs are adding support for these streaming services plus features that lets your tablet show you a mirror of what 's on your tv -- sometimes alongside your social networks			1
@entity14 's latest @entity241 - @entity240 sets and @entity17 's @entity120 have integrated near - field communications ( @entity243 ) that allow you to tap your @entity243 - enabled smartphone or tablet ( no @entity135 products have @entity243 ) to mirror what 's on the set or bring up related social content			1
an upgrading alternative smart tvs are expensive , so @entity15 has come up with an interesting product to let you upgrade your existing tv without buying a new model			2
( @entity256 , it doubles as a way to make money from tv buyers between new models			0
) the evolution kit is a black box on the back of a @entity15 smart tv that you can replace to upgrade the tv 's software and some specifications			0
the company did n't announce a price for the upgrade module , which was first announced at last year 's @entity19 , but says it will be available early this year			2
the box can update your software to add the newest features and improve your processors for a speedier tv experience			0
but it ca n't upgrade the resolution of your screen .			0
