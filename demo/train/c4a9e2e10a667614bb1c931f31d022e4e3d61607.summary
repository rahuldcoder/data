-- only two @entity2 presidential candidates will appear on the ballot in @entity4 next year , regardless of how many are in the race			1
@entity6 and @entity7 will have the @entity8 all to themselves			0
supporters of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 will have to be content with yard signs or donations as ways of cheering on their favorite would - be nominee			1
that 's because their campaigns failed to gain the requisite 10,000 signatures			2
it is , to be sure , a self - inflicted wound , a measure of some organizational chaos			0
but it is also a function of illogically restrictive local laws			2
they not only impede ballot access but end up denying open representative democracy to operate on the road to the @entity33			1
the @entity34 is the only nation in the world , save @entity36 , that does not have uniform federal ballot access laws , according to @entity38 , a website run by @entity40 that is dedicated to the issue			1
this may reflect the country 's closely held federalism , but it can create chaos in a presidential year			0
in many cases , the rules are imposed by state party bosses who are less interested in democracy than in rigging the system to benefit their favored candidates			1
take , for example , my home state of @entity55			0
it votes reliably @entity57 in presidential years , at least since @entity59 thrashed @entity60 in 1984			0
but the state 's primary delegates can still be a prize in a protracted @entity2 nomination fight			1
in 1999 , @entity65 had to sue to even have his name appear on the ballot alongside @entity68 because the @entity2 state party chair and his committee essentially decided that @entity68 would be their nominee without the inconvenience of putting it to a vote			1
local laws allowed them to restrict ballot access until public pressure and a court injunction overruled their attempted end - run around democracy			1
each presidential cycle , the corrupt kabuki continues			0
in this election season , @entity4 's ballot is n't the only one with high barriers to entry			1
@entity86 requires 4,500 signatures and @entity88 3,000			0
in @entity90 , some @entity2 officials are warning that not a single @entity2 candidate could qualify for the state 's primary ballot			1
changes to ballot laws last spring now give candidates about two weeks after they declare on january 19 to collect 1,000 signatures from registered @entity2 for a ballot spot -- a difficult task during the cold season			1
because our primary system focuses intensely on the first few states -- notably january 's gantlet of @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 -- dark - horse candidates logically focus their efforts and limited resources on crucial early contests			2
but if they are able to build enough support in those states , they can find themselves cut off at the knees in later primary states with high - hurdle filing deadlines or signature requirements			0
this adds to the advantage of establishment candidates with enough big money behind them to build national organizations before the early states have even voted			1
@entity2 primary voters have watched their candidates debate more than a dozen times this year alone			1
by the time january is over , the current field of seven candidates will probably be cut to three or four			0
certainly , at that crucial stage of the nomination , every registered @entity2 should have a chance to vote for his or her preferred nominee			2
one of the major problems in @entity34 politics today is that the parties have forgotten that they are not the purpose of our democracy			0
independent voters like me -- now nearly 40 % of the electorate and on the rise across the nation -- are effectively disenfranchised in the crucial closed partisan primaries where most elections are effectively decided			0
open primaries , such as in @entity106 , where independents are allowed to vote , often have the additional benefit of selecting the best general election candidate , the one best able to appeal to centrists as well as conservatives			0
look , i 'd like to see more open primaries across the nation as a means of achieving a more representative democracy , less disproportionately dominated by partisan activists			0
but surely , registered @entity2 should have the ability to vote for the candidate of their choice , regardless of ridiculously restrictive local election laws			1
" it 's very disappointing watching people on tv act like its only @entity10 or @entity11 who are being affected , " said @entity40 , who runs @entity38			2
" it 's the voters who are being injured			0
" @entity173 , @entity11 and the other leading @entity2 deserve to have their names appear on the ballot as long as their campaigns continue			1
their supporters should have the right to vote for their favored candidate			0
anything less is hiding behind legalisms , with other candidates defending the status quo because it suits their short - term self - interest , not because it is right or just			0
it is a coward 's way to win a primary , and it demeans our democracy by denying voters the full range of choice at a pivotal point in the race for the presidency			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 : rules on collecting signatures have left only 2 @entity2 candidates on @entity4 ballot
lack of uniform federal ballot access laws disenfranchises some primary voters , he says
he says state party *machines* can set *arbitrary* rules that favor establishment candidates
@entity198 : @entity173 , @entity11 , other @entity2 candidates deserve names on the ballot if they *'re* running
