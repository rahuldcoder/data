@entity0 -- despite attempts by the authorities to censor coverage , millions of people across mainland @entity3 have watched warily over the past few days as thousands of @entity7 have occupied the heart of their city calling for greater democracy			1
for many the verve and passion of this student - led revolt has been captivating to witness			0
but others are less impressed			0
" i think the ' @entity25 ' movement is the @entity20 version of so - called street politics and color revolutions we 've seen in other countries , " @entity18 , who helped facilitate the handover of @entity20 to @entity3 from @entity21 , told @entity1 wednesday , as @entity3 marked @entity22 -- the foundation of the @entity3 on october 1 , 1949			1
" it 's very dangerous			0
it 's an obviously illegal movement			1
" @entity18 says the protest is bad for @entity20 's reputation			1
" it has caused great harm to @entity20 in the past few days			0
democracy and the rule of law are the pillars of economic prosperity and social stability in @entity20			1
' @entity25 ' has attacked both pillars , " he said			1
illegal demonstration @entity3 itself has labeled the demonstrations " illegal			1
" some analysts claim the protests have been the most significant since the former colony 's handover from @entity21 to @entity3 in 1997			1
but not everyone in @entity3 knows about the occupation of @entity20 's central districts -- the beating heart of this @entity56 financial hub			1
@entity0 's censors have been blocking reports , including @entity1 's , in the mainstream and social media			0
but those who know , like @entity18 , are watching warily , worried that any clashes or incidents between protesters and police -- as we witnessed on sunday when the authorities resorted to using tear gas -- could lead to bloodshed or trigger a harsh crackdown			1
@entity18 was posted to the city in 1994 as a member of the preparatory committee for the formation of @entity20 as a @entity74 ( @entity74 ) of @entity3			1
he was @entity3 's point - person in the @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , in charge of negotiating with @entity21 side over the 1997 handover of power			1
he now heads the @entity81 of @entity20 and @entity82 , a think - tank based in @entity0			0
' gullible ' protesters while @entity18 praised the passion of the young protesters , he questioned whether they 'd been misled			1
" the passion of @entity20 's young people is commendable -- they care about current affairs and politics , care about the future of @entity20 and @entity3 , " he said			2
" but they tend to be gullible and excitable as their class boycott and peaceful sit - in became ' @entity25			2
' " @entity18 accused " some people " of manipulating the protest movement			1
" some adults -- i mean those with beards and wrinkles -- suddenly show up in front of the youth to tell them what to do , what not to do , what should be done , what should be their goal , " he said			0
" we 're all shocked			0
as i 've read in @entity20 media , those adults -- would they let their own children lie on the streets ? what are they doing after receiving illegal funding ? these are the questions posed by @entity20 people online that i 've read			0
" @entity18 declined to give specifics , simply saying " just read what is out there in the @entity20 media			2
" @entity3 crackdown would @entity3 would consider sending @entity126 ( @entity126 ) troops on to the streets of @entity20 if the protest persists for a long time ? " the past few days the central government has already stated many times , " he answered tangentially			2
" we believe that the @entity20 government has the ability to handle well the illegal acts of the @entity136			0
" the retired vice minister insisted that @entity3 's decision to allow " universal suffrage " in the 2017 election is already a significant progress towards democracy			2
" if you study the decision by the @entity145 of the @entity146 , you will find it comparable to universal suffrage in many other countries during various periods of time			0
it 's one person , one vote and every vote counts the same			0
it takes some western countries 200 years to achieve			0
but after resuming sovereignty over @entity20 , it took @entity3 only 20 years to achieve this in the chief executive election , " he said			2
but many ordinary hong kongers insist they want full universal suffrage , rejecting @entity0 's decision to allow only @entity0 - vetted candidates to run for the 2017 election for chief executive			0
will @entity3 be open to changing the elections system in the future to make it freer ? " i 'm not a prophet , " he replied			2
" i think @entity20 's political system will become fairer , more democratic and more open			0
" one country , two systems " is a fundamental national policy			1
no matter how ' @entity25 ' becomes , it wo n't change shake this policy			1
i believe it will be thoroughly implemented into the future			0
" meantime , @entity18 sees no room for @entity3 to back down from its stated position			1
" i know the plotters of @entity25 , " he said			2
" they launched this illegal action with the central government as its target			0
they demand that the @entity145 of the @entity146 will rescind its decision on universal suffrage			0
however , i think that is futile			0
" many political observers have compared @entity25 to @entity196 in 1989 , when the @entity3 army brutally crushed the six - week - long protest in central @entity0			1
what is @entity18 's take ? " they are not comparable , " was his only reply .			2

@entity18 helped negotiate with the @entity21 side over the 1997 handover of power to @entity3
