-- it 's been a rough month for chickens			1
not that there 's ever an especially good month when your only job on this planet is to sit around , get fat and occasionally pop out eggs			2
it 's kind of like living your entire life as a " @entity12 " cast member			2
but with a shred of dignity			2
this particular rough month actually started trending two weeks ago when , early in the morning on july 9 , a truck carrying more than 5,000 chickens overturned in downtown @entity17 , @entity18			1
sadly , many of the poor little cluckers died			2
others , perhaps stunned from the crash , just wandered aimlessly about the streets , suddenly free from captivity			2
which must 've been remarkably weird			2
" @entity26 , is this heaven ? " " no. it 's @entity17			1
" the story quickly found its way around the @entity31 because , really , it has all the makings of must - see news			2
was there a big crash ? yes			2
was there negligence involved ? possibly			2
did hundreds of live animals on a roadway have to be rounded up by humans			0
abso - freakin - lutely ! it was gold			0
but just when the @entity17 truck story seemed to go away -- as oddball stories eventually do -- it magically came roaring back			1
all thanks to @entity47 ( @entity47 )			1
in response to the crash , the organization proposed a 5Â½ - foot - tall , 250 - pound statue of a giant bloody chicken on crutches , memorializing the hundreds that perished in the crash			1
@entity47 hoped it could stand at the intersection near where the accident happened to alert livestock truckers to be extra careful and to remind motorists that " chickens are among the most abused animals on the planet			1
" @entity47 spokeswoman @entity62 added that " the best way to prevent crashes like this is to go vegan so that chickens do n't have to make the trip to the slaughterhouse in the first place			1
" personally , i love the idea			0
mind you , not because of my politics -- when it comes to such matters , i have no opinion			0
but i do love absurd landmarks			0
and every city needs something delightfully wackadoo			0
oddly enough , we actually have a big chicken right here in @entity85 's northern suburb of @entity86			1
we call it ... the @entity88			0
the huge structure stands 56 feet high , rising into the air from a @entity91			0
so , in a sense , it , too , is a monument to dead chickens			1
dead chickens coated with 11 herbs and spices			1
the best part about @entity86 's @entity88 is that people actually use it as a directional landmark			0
" make a left at the @entity88			0
and you 'll find me on the sidewalk			0
i 'll be the one not wearing pants			0
" so it 's helpful			0
and i 've actually seen it used in serious news stories			0
this is a real excerpt from a 2009 article in the @entity113 : " a @entity86 police officer involved in a two - car accident saturday afternoon is fine , according to police officials			0
the incident occurred around 3:25 p.m. at @entity118 and @entity119 in front of the @entity88			0
" naturally , if you did n't know about the landmark , reading this would blow your mind			0
" that must 've been one crazy - ass chicken			1
" unfortunately , @entity47 's @entity127 of @entity17 statue was officially shot down this week by the @entity129			1
@entity130 , a city traffic engineer , noted that it 's a congested area and the statue " would be a distraction and possibly a hazard			1
" so , now , chickens in @entity17 will just have to live in constant fear of another roadside tragedy while they 're on their way to get slaughtered			1
and speaking of chicken slaughter , there was another story that started trending this week			1
it was about an @entity145 woman who found a chicken foot in a package of breast meat from @entity149			1
the disgusted shopper tweeted , " hey , @ @entity149 , does this look like ' chicken breast ' to you ? i 'm vomiting			1
" despite the @entity157 chastising the woman for overreacting , @entity149 nevertheless confirmed that the chicken foot was real and issued a statement saying , " while the part does not pose a health risk , we are investigating how it became packaged in with our product			1
" and then the ghost of the chicken issued its own statement : " i 'm incredibly sorry that my severed foot somehow ended up in the same package as my severed breast			1
i know that must 've been unsettling			0
@entity169 : my head is in a landfill			0
it 's been a rough month for chickens			2
follow @entity175 on @entity176 .			0
