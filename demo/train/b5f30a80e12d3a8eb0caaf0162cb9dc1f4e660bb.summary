-- sporting a black t - shirt proudly proclaiming " @entity2 , " a group of grinning boys form a slightly jagged circle inside a dusty yard on the outskirts of @entity8 , @entity9 's capital			1
inside the circle a bandana - wearing dance instructor spins from his back onto his chest flaring his legs high in the air in a v - shape			2
the boys respond to his virtuoso dance moves with claps and cheers before taking to the floor themselves , twisting and turning as they try to perfect their breakdance moves			0
they are part of an uplifting dance project at @entity25 , a residential care center working to transform the lives of former street children in @entity9			1
the center accommodates 126 boys aged six to 18 who , apart from their tough upbringing , share a deep passion for an art form that also originated in the streets : hip - hop			1
" once their basic needs are fulfilled , they need to nourish their spirit , their self - esteem and their pride in themselves , " says @entity36 , co-founder of @entity9 , a @entity38 - based group that organizes art programs for vulnerable youth			1
" i think hip - hop really helps to do that , because it 's such a young person 's art form -- it came off the streets and it 's about one - on - one teaching			1
there 's this great spirit of sharing in hip hop , " she adds			2

he says the children were living a tough , hopeless life in the streets			0
they had no time to laugh or relax as they always had to take care of themselves			0
their story has been immortalized in " yes , man ! " a short documentary film screening thursday at the @entity89 festival in @entity90			1
" now , to see them smiling , without stress , ( being ) enthusiastic , open , very active and then seeing also some children around appreciating the ones who were dancing , you could understand how dancing is helping them to come out of themselves , to express their inner harmony , their inner happiness and forget the hard life they have experienced			0

an estimated one million orphans and " other vulnerable children " live in the country , according to @entity153			0
@entity125 says that communities are not often able to deal with the direct and indirect effects of the genocide , leading to thousands of children taking to the streets			2
many of them suffer from neglect and abuse , while others resort to drug use			0
the center , which was founded in 2002 , provides the boys with food , a place to sleep and healthcare			2
it also offers sports training , as well as education at school and vocational training at various centers -- all part of efforts to help the children remove the trauma of street life through rehabilitation			0
ultimately , the center 's goal is to reintegrate the children into the society once they are entirely rehabilitated			1
" children of the street are children like the others , " says former street kid @entity186 in " yes , man ! " " when they get love , they are children like the others			1
so , when they get someone who helps them , who takes care of them , they will become a real man , " adds @entity186 , 18 , who spent four and a half years on the street before going to live at @entity125			1

" they love hip hop so much			2
now , many of them are dancing to songs they have made themselves			0
