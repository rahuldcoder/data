the majestic trees that line streets across the @entity2 are a beautiful sight most of the year			0
then there are the weeks when a winter storm hits , and the trees shed ice - laden limbs that crash down on the power lines below			1
it 's at those times when millions of normally genteel @entity2 voices rise as one to ask , " why are n't these & @ $ # * % ! wires underground ? " in one word : @entity15			0
how bad will it get ? after a 2002 storm that knocked out electricity to 2 million customers in @entity20 , regulators there took a look at what it would cost to bury the three major power companies ' overhead lines			2
the state @entity26 concluded the project would be " prohibitively expensive			1
" " such an undertaking would cost approximately $ 41 billion , nearly six times the net book value of the utilities ' current distribution assets , and would require approximately 25 years to complete , " the report states			0
customers ' rates would have to more than double to pay for the project , the commission ' staff found			0
it 's not the snow , it 's the ice and underground lines " are not without their disadvantages , " they concluded			0
while more reliable " under normal weather conditions , " they take almost 60 % longer to fix when something does happen to them			0
underground power lines make up about 18 % of @entity51 transmission lines , according to the federal @entity52			2
nearly all new residential and commercial developments have underground electric service , the agency said			0
but it noted that underground power lines cost five to 10 times more than overhead wires , do n't last as long and cost more to replace			2
stir crazy ? how to stay sane " buried power lines are protected from the wind , ice and tree damage that are common causes of outages , and so suffer fewer weather or vegetation - related outages , " it concluded			1
" but buried lines are more vulnerable to flooding , and can still fail due to equipment issues or lightning			1
" but there are some places that have decided to go ahead and dig. in @entity75 , @entity76 , the city is gradually burying its above - ground power lines , a project that dates back to the 1990s			1
the city added a 4 % surcharge to electric bills to pay for the 50 - year project , which costs more than $ 3 million a mile			1
opinion : why we should bury the power lines			2

putting power lines underground is expensive , time - consuming
@entity20 studied it , determined it would be ' prohibitively expensive '
while protected from weather , buried lines are still vulnerable to flooding
@entity75 , @entity76 , in *middle* of 50 - year line burying project
