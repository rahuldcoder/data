-- moonshots are exciting , inspiring			2
but they are also expensive -- and not all of them work out like @entity5			2
so are they worth it ? should we focus time , money and energy on these kinds of ambitious scientific projects ? the answer is yes			1
think of it this way			0
imagine that the @entity15 had not succeeded			0
would it still have been worth it ? almost certainly			1
after all , the challenge of getting to the moon and back meant coming up with all kinds of technological innovations and solutions that have then had almost miraculous commercial applications			0
for example , @entity15 needed small computers for its trip			0
so @entity27 says it made a big purchase of a relatively new technology -- the integrated circuit , the technology behind what we now know as the microchip			0
the companies that pioneered this product -- firms such as @entity38 , whose alumni founded @entity41 -- partly had @entity27 to thank , the agency says , for the popularity of the technology that followed			0
the @entity46 government , by buying the initial products , helped the computer revolution take off			0
and it 's not just the microchip			2
gps technology , which is now powering the next phase of the information revolution , was originally developed by the @entity46 military			0
but it was only after the 1983 @entity56 shooting down of a @entity58 flight that the @entity60 administration said it would share the technology so that civilian airplanes would not wander into restricted and dangerous territories			1
and it was only after the @entity65 ended that the @entity67 administration opened up the technology fully to commercial applications , which of course unleashed a flood of innovation that continues to this @entity72 or consider the mapping of the human genome			0
according to the @entity76 , the federal government spent $ 3.8 billion on the massive project from 1990 to 2003 , an amount few other entities could ever have afforded			2
but in leading the way , it encouraged others , and now a person 's dna can be sequenced for as little as $ 1,000			2
the impact on the economy of human genome sequencing from 1988 to 2010 was estimated by @entity76 at almost $ 800 billion -- enough to support more than 310,000 jobs in 2010 alone			0
reading all this , you might think the @entity46 is on the right track			0
alas , the problem is , it is not			0
federal funding for research and development has barely been keeping up with inflation in recent years if you look at the numbers from the @entity100			1
since big entitlements such as @entity103 are mandatory spending programs , it is discretionary spending , such as science , that often bears the brunt of the budget ax			2
@entity110 and this cutting comes at a time when others around the world are moving fast			0
the @entity46 has dominated the world of basic science for years , even decades			1
but recently , its share of global research and development has been falling -- from 37 % of the total in 2001 to 30 % in 2011 , according to the @entity100			1
as scientist @entity121 points out , @entity120 is on course to surpass the @entity46 in the percentage of its gross domestic product it spends on research and development in just a few years			1
it used to be that funding basic science was not a partisan issue			1
as @entity121 notes , a certain rock - ribbed @entity130 was a big proponent of basic research			1
@entity60 said in a 1988 radio address : " the remarkable thing is that although basic research does not begin with a particular practical goal , when you look at the results over the years , it ends up being one of the most practical things government does			1
this is why i 've urged @entity145 to devote more money to research			2
it is an indispensable investment in @entity46 's future			1
" @entity46 used to understand that moonshots inspire us , but that they also power @entity46 's future			1
let 's hope that today 's politicians follow @entity60 's advice and invest in science , research and development			1

@entity161 : ambitious scientific projects are worth pursuing
federal funding for research and development is barely keeping up with inflation , he says
funding basic science research did *n't* use to be a partisan issue , @entity161 says
today 's politicians should follow @entity60 's advice and invest in future , he says
