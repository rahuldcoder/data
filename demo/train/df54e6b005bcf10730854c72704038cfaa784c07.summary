-- photographers and artists have a long relationship with art books as vehicles that share their work with audiences beyond the gallery circuit			1
but do those books have a shelf life beyond their era ? to explore their influence on contemporary artists , photography nonprofit @entity12 asked 10 artists to create new works inspired by a photo book or magazine from the publisher 's backlist			1
the final " responses " make up the multimedia exhibit " @entity23 : a 60th @entity25 " at @entity27 's @entity26			1
the exhibit will travel internationally after the show ends nov. 17			2
viewers will be able to see the original books and images that inspired the " interventions , " which come in various forms , from new photo books and video slideshows to a functioning camera made of books			1
" we want everyone to be able to look at the original work in its purest form as prints , how they were reproduced in aperture books and what the artists were able to do with it , " said @entity39 , publisher of the @entity12 's book program and the foundation 's director of content			1
" it was a good time in general to look at the way the photo book has an enduring influence that crosses time and geography , " she said			2
" we wanted to choose artists who represent how far photography has come in the last 60 years			2
" most of the artists worked with @entity12 before , allowing them to reflect on their relationships as artists with photo books			1
" photo books are the ultimate collaboration between text and images			1
it 's a very complete vehicle for anybody who is or is not interested in photography , " said visual artist @entity67 , who used " the @entity70 of @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 " ( 1973 ) as the inspiration for his aperture piece			1
fine art photography : when ' reality is n't good enough ' @entity80 , who is known for recreating iconic images with unconventional materials , like syrup and peanut butter , seemed like a natural fit for the project , @entity79 said			2
he was the subject of the award - winning documentary " @entity95 , " which follows the development of his 2008 series of photographic portraits made from trash			0
for his piece , @entity80 wanted to use an @entity12 title that he felt exemplified the connection between text and images			1
he chose a collection of @entity104 photographer @entity71 's journal entries in the 1920s and 1930s , a time of personal and professional transformation for the iconic @entity104 photographer			2
" i chose it because it was written by a photographer , and it tells a beautiful story in a very personal way , " @entity80 said			0
" he 's talking about his feelings and has a very interesting way of looking at how the entire creative process took place in the time it did , not to mention it 's a very romantic book			2
" while the book itself is a 310 - page novel that 's light on images , @entity80 sought to " create a sort of image that would be emblematic of the whole experience of reading the book			1
" using torn up pages from a first edition copy of " @entity70 " as source material , he pieces together a photographic collage of @entity71 's lover , @entity134 photographer @entity133			2
purists might call it desecration of a vintage novel , but he sees it as a recreation of a beloved story			0
" most of my work is about emphasizing the bits and parts , the mechanisms and gears that make an image work , " he said			0
" we all take bits and pieces of books when we read them in a way that we can never look at a book in the same way , " he said			2
" the words in the book will survive because they 're proven to have historical value , but the material has transcended mechanism into something else			0
" @entity162 approached the entire canon of " @entity164 " as a singular project in her search for images of mountains			0
using her @entity169 , she photographed and processed images by @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , among others , through a series of camera apps to create 87 " reimagined " images as a way of transforming a ( mostly ) stable landscape feature into a " disorienting , unstable condition , " she said			1
the notion of instability also applies to photography as a medium whose nature is constantly being changed by technology , she said			0
" i wondered if there was a correlation between the medium becoming so unstable and idea of a mountain as the most stable object on the planet , " she said			0
" i thought it would be interesting to take a look at that with a device that 's changing our day - to - day lives			0
" she downloaded seven or eight apps onto her @entity169 but ended up using the same four most often ( @entity209 - mob , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 ) for the " disorienting " effects of their filters , creating a candy - colored assortment of images			0
the resulting project , " @entity213 , " has three components on display			0
one is an array of framed images of different sizes arranged on a wall " in an odd block , " she said			0
she also produced a video slideshow and a photo book that she likens to a " replica " of the " masters of photography " book with mountains			1
photography has been at the forefront of the " remix culture " within art and music in the past century , she said			0
from pop art photo collages to @entity234 and smartphone apps , the evolution of photography has led the way for bigger cultural shifts			0
" the idea of intervention and remix is relevant to what 's been happening in the last 10 - 15 years , where we have a kind of remix culture of things being collected and mashed up , " she said			1
" it 's in the air			0
it makes sense for @entity12 to do this for its 60th anniversary			1
