-- this week the @entity1 is n't running away from the abortion issue			1
almost all of tuesday night 's speakers made some reference to reproductive freedom , from @entity7 of @entity8 to @entity9			1
so confidently and constantly was it mentioned that it became something of a litany			0
@entity13 is for it , @entity14 wants it passionately , @entity16 sees it as a fundamental right			0
in case you missed it , the @entity20 really , really believe in reproductive freedom			1
the electoral message is that @entity25 and the @entity26 are waging a war on women , or at least a concerted effort to limit access to contraception and abortion			1
the goal is to expand the gender voting gap to the @entity20 's advantage			1
and also to turn out the base -- reviving the liberal coalition that put @entity38 in office in 2008 by contrast , @entity25 seems to be avoiding abortion talk as much as possible			1
he mentioned it only once in his convention speech , and the ticket has been beset by rumors of flipping and u-turning on the issue			2
no one doubts that the @entity26 is as anti-abortion as ever , but it seems to regard the matter as a distraction from this election 's central issue -- jobs			1
historically , this finds us in a very unusual situation			0
it used to be republicans who used abortion as a wedge issue against @entity20			1
now it 's the other way around			0
for more than 30 years , @entity26 used abortion partly from conviction , partly to win religious voters and partly just to keep the @entity20 on a back foot , forcing them constantly to equivocate in a manner that made them seem muddled or the prisoner of the feminist lobby			1
when they ran for the @entity69 in 1992 , @entity67 and @entity68 had both " evolved " on the issue so dramatically or cynically that even the spokeswoman for the @entity72 described the position as " pretty slippery			2
" in office , @entity67 stuck to a formula of " safe , legal and rare " that seemed to acknowledge that abortion was something troubling that ought to be reduced			2
when she was setting herself up for a presidential run , @entity81 described abortion as a " sad , even tragic choice " that she hoped would " not ever have to be exercised			2
" yet neither @entity67 nor @entity81 lobbied for legal limits that would reduce the number of procedures significantly			0
until recently the @entity1 message has been that abortion is almost too complex for a definitive stance			2
recall the painful contortions that @entity91 went through in 2004 , trying to explain how a faithful @entity92 could regard abortion as a matter of private conscience			0
the electoral problem was less @entity91 's thoughtful attempt to resolve a painful conundrum than it was @entity98 's comparative clarity			0
all that changed under @entity9			2
evidence suggests that this is not a man who has ever doubted that the abortion rights position is both constitutional and ethical			1
as a state senator he voted " present " on a bill that would have compelled doctors to provide life support to fetuses that survived a termination procedure and were not expected to live			0
@entity9 argued that the language of the bill extended the legal protection to a " pre-viable " infant and so would not be constitutional			2
( @entity114 notes that @entity126 " already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus -- meaning able to survive outside of the mother 's body -- then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion			2
" ) as a presidential candidate , he trumpeted his support for @entity130 and abortion rights			1
as president , he reopened the flow of tax dollars via @entity136 foreign aid to groups that provide abortion overseas , and he refused to use his authority to support a bill that banned gender - selective terminations			0
the @entity69 said that bill would " subject doctors to criminal prosecution if they fail to determine the motivations " behind abortions , according to news reports			0
the @entity20 's platform theoretically contains no limit on access to abortion			1
in another historical switch , the @entity1 platform is now the more radical			0
the political meaning of the president 's approach to reproductive rights is hard to fathom			0
conservatives insist that the so - called war on women is a cynical distraction from the poor performance of the economy			2
but it 's hard to imagine that working			0
pollsters repeatedly say that abortion rights ranks low on voters ' list of priorities , and with unemployment seemingly stuck at higher than 8 percent , some may resent the attempted obfuscation			1
pollsters also report that the " pro-choice " position is at a record low			0
if the @entity20 wanted a moral issue to beat the @entity26 with , they 'd probably be better off focusing on same - sex marriage			1
but maybe it all comes back to likability -- something that @entity9 easily outranks @entity25 on			1
@entity182 's appalling comments on sexual assault , @entity185 's attempt to distinguish between legal varieties of rape , and the conversation among conservatives about abortion in cases of rape and incest -- all of these have communicated the sense that the @entity26 attitudes toward women are old - fashioned , bordering on medieval			1
it smacks of precisely what conservatism promises not to be : the state telling people what to do with their lives			0
and the language is far removed from the experience of most people , for whom all rape is rape and contraception is a reality , not a theological challenge			0
perhaps @entity9 is using abortion less as a specific issue to wedge between @entity26 and women than as a way of accentuating the infamous @entity25 " weirdo factor			1
" the narrative throughout tuesday 's proceedings has been that the @entity20 are as diverse and ordinary as the rest of @entity136 , contrasted with the wealth and social @entity222 attitudes of the @entity26			1
the president 's approach is a big gamble			0
it is true that likability matters , and there 's no doubt that the news cycle on moral issues currently favors the president ( thanks largely to @entity182 )			0
but the constant reference to abortion rights tuesday night was at risk of coming off too strong			1
abortion is a complex , painful issue that touches upon faith , gender and class			2
it is not a matter that lends itself well to electioneering			0
more importantly , there 's a danger that in pushing the " war on women , " @entity9 may seem distracted from the real challenges facing @entity136			1
@entity251 , debt and health care are what matter most to voters in 2012			0
it 's still the economy , mr. president			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			2

@entity262 : @entity20 are not running from abortion issue , just the *opposite*
he says @entity25 avoids it -- a switch for @entity26 , which has long used it as wedge issue
@entity260 : *unlike* top @entity20 in past , @entity9 makes it clear he supports abortion rights
@entity260 : @entity9 , *democrats* risk sounding like " war on women " fight more important than jobs
