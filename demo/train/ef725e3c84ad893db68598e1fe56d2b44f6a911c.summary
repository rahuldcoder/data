the school board representing @entity2 's largest school district on monday night will consider scrapping a controversial policy requiring teachers not to discuss homosexuality in school			1
the @entity8 's sexual orientation curriculum policy , adopted in 2009 , bars teachers from taking a position on homosexuality in the classroom and says such matters are best addressed outside of school			1
it 's become known as the neutrality policy			1
during monday night 's hearing , the school board will propose replacing that policy with a " controversial topics curriculum policy " that , according to the proposed wording , " recognizes the importance of providing information about controversial topics in a democracy			1
" however , it states that teachers and staff " shall not advocate personal beliefs or opinions " regarding those controversial topics -- which are not named -- in the classroom			1
it 's one of many changes being considered to the district 's harassment , violence , and discrimination policy and its religious activities policy			0
the so - called " neutrality policy " triggered a federal lawsuit by students who allege the policy creates a toxic environment for lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender students -- or students perceived to be @entity48			1
the school district has refrained from commenting on specifics in the lawsuit			2
superintendent @entity53 has said in the past that the neutrality policy -- which has attracted just as many local supporters as it has critics to heated school board meetings -- is a reasonable response to a divided community			1
" it 's a diverse community , " @entity53 told @entity62 earlier this year , " and what we 're trying to do , what i 'm trying to do as a superintendent , is walk down the @entity60			0
" the @entity67 , which filed the lawsuit in july on behalf of the students , praised the school district for reconsidering the neutrality policy			1
" the students and families ... feel that policy improvements are one important step forward in making the school district a more welcoming environment for all students , " the @entity67 said in a statement issued last week			2
@entity81 - @entity80 encompasses the @entity83 ' northwestern suburbs and is the state 's largest school district			0
the school district made headlines in recent years after seven students committed suicide between november 2009 and may 2011			2
parents and friends say four of those students were either gay , perceived to be gay or questioning their sexuality			0
they say , at least two of them were bullied because of their sexuality			0
the school district says there is no evidence that the suicides were linked to bullying , noting that it has a separate , and comprehensive , bullying prohibition policy			2
" we have no evidence that bullying or harassment took place in any of those cases , " superintendent @entity53 said			0
@entity53 emphasized students need to report bullying , and he acknowledged " gay students in our district struggle with bullying and harassment on a daily basis			0
" nevertheless , the string of suicides stirred public debate over the school 's sexual orientation curriculum policy			0
the school district is also in the middle of a federal investigation into " allegations of harassment and discrimination in the @entity127 based on sex , including peer - on - peer harassment based on not conforming to gender stereotypes , " according to a district memo			0
the school board could vote on the proposed changes to the neutrality policy as soon as the next school board meeting in early january , said @entity136 , president of the local teachers ' union			1
@entity136 , whose union represents about 2,800 teachers in the school district , plans to meet with the teachers to formulate a " position statement " on the proposed changes			2
she said she wants to make sure the policy clearly defines " controversial topics " and what it means for teachers and staff to " advocate personal beliefs or opinions , " which the proposed policy prohibits			1
overall , @entity136 says she welcomes changes to the existing neutrality policy , which she described as vague and difficult for teachers to interpret			1
" neutrality has not given us good guidance in the classroom , " @entity136 explained			0
" you can interpret that so many ways ( so ) it had a chilling effect on any discussion			0
" and these times when ... our gay students are under more likely to be a target of bullying , that 's not the time to chill a discussion about sexual orientation , " she said .			0

@entity2 school board to propose changes to controversial " neutrality policy "
under the policy , teachers are barred from discussing homosexuality in the classroom
the proposed changes would allow for controversial topics to be examined in the classroom
the previous policy triggered a federal lawsuit by a *group* of students
