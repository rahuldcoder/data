@entity0 , @entity1 -- they are coming from cities across @entity1 , including @entity5 and @entity6 : students are leaving mainland @entity1 for the opportunity to study in @entity0 instead			1

" i live in one country , but it feels like having two identities , " @entity13 said			0
" in @entity6 , i use special software to access sites blacklisted by the government , like @entity26 or the uncensored version of @entity28			0
" in @entity0 , i am taught to integrate these tools in my research			0
" in the past , students such as @entity13 would have to travel to far - away countries to get around @entity5 's control of information			0
now , they are taking advantage of @entity0 's special administrative status that allows for a " one country , two systems " rule until 2047			2
@entity0 is nothing like mainland @entity1 in terms of its free flow of information , freedom of speech and multiparty political system			1
those differences were recently emphasized by @entity28 's row with the @entity1 government over censorship			2
in march , @entity28 announced it was routing its users to an uncensored version of the internet search engine based in @entity0 , amid speculation that @entity28 would pull out of @entity1 entirely			1
@entity1 's reaction to @entity28 's announcement " when @entity28 redirected its site from @entity1 to @entity0 , it meant a lot of publicity for our free harbor , " said @entity56 , a @entity1 analyst at the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
" [ @entity28 's ] move has emphasized @entity0 's significance in @entity1 , benefiting from the rule of law and its potential as a free information hub			1
" many young @entity1 have explored that hub since 1997 when the the @entity71 colony was handed over to @entity1 , paving the way for @entity1 from the mainland to apply to universities in @entity0			1
the influx of students applying from the mainland created fierce competition to enter @entity0 's top universities			1
the number of mainland @entity1 applying for @entity14 's undergraduate program has increased more than tenfold in the past decade			1
in 2008 , some 12,000 mainlanders applied for the 300 slots that hku reserves for students from mainland @entity1			1
@entity13 said he considers himself very lucky to be studying in @entity0 " free access to information is a need and a privilege , " he said			0
the influx of talent such as @entity13 could signify a brain drain for mainland @entity1 , according to @entity92			1
" without political reform , economic growth in @entity1 will decline , " he said			0
" talents will leave @entity1			2
students and teachers who want to have more access to information are not dissidents anymore			0
they are becoming the mainstream			0
" @entity103 's top five universities are now located in @entity0 , @entity104 and @entity105 -- outstripping their rivals in mainland @entity1 -- according to a recent ranking of @entity108 , a higher education information network company			1
the top mainland school was @entity110 in @entity5 in 12th place , down from its previous ranking of 10			0
see @entity103 university rankings the data show that " the tide has turned , " according to @entity116 , an internet consultant based in @entity0 and @entity5			2
" during the dotcom era [ of the 1990s ] , head - hunters were looking for talent from universities in @entity6 and @entity5 , " @entity116 said			0
" now they are coming to @entity0			0
" with new freedom at hand , only a few fresh @entity14 graduates have returned to the mainland			0
last year , only 3 percent of @entity14 graduates from mainland @entity1 returned home to look for a job			1
that matches the trend of @entity1 students studying overseas			2
more than 70 percent of the more than 1 million @entity1 students abroad did not return home after graduation between 1978 and 2006 , according to a report by the @entity136 aware of this brain drain , the @entity1 government has recently introduced a plan to attract highly qualified students back to the mainland promising better living standards , including favorable access to medical care			1
but that has n't tempted @entity146 who , like many of his friends , wants to stay in @entity0			0
" i love my country , but i do n't want to give up on my right to access information , " he said .			0

more students are leaving mainland @entity1 to study in @entity0 universities
some say it 's because of the government 's *restrictions* to the internet
many who leave mainland @entity1 to study elsewhere never return
@entity1 is trying to lure highly qualified students back by promising better living standards
