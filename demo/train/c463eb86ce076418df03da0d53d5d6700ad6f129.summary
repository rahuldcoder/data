-- the year is 1969 and @entity1 is at the peak of its counter-culture revolution -- a time of sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll			0
the @entity8 are putting together their final album while a relatively unknown musician , @entity10 is making waves with his track " @entity14			0
" meanwhile , in @entity16 , a 15 - year - old schoolgirl is headed for trouble			0
though academically gifted , @entity18 is bored at school and overcome with a mix of teenage angst and a vivid imagination			1
she 's beginning to hang around with a rough crowd and soon finds herself in trouble with the law			1
but one person has taken notice of her downward spiral -- her high school principal			0
" the headmaster said to me , ' i do n't care if you do maths or biology or whatever , it does n't matter ... but make sure that you use your imagination for creative good rather than self - destruction ' , " recalls @entity18			1
fast forward several decades and she 's done just that			2
today @entity18 , 59 , is the artistic director of @entity1 's beloved cultural institution -- @entity43 's @entity42			1
looking back , it 's clear how defining that very moment was			2
" as soon as he said it , i knew he was right -- i feel very strongly that young people deserve help , time , space and permission to be expressive			0
" his advice spurred @entity18 to form a drama club with her fellow classmates including @entity56 , the now bestselling @entity1 horror author , and comedian @entity58			1
after high school , her passion for the arts continued to flourish			0
studying drama at @entity64 , she decided to become a director			2
it was a bold career choice for women in the 1970s -- but by age 22 , she defied naysayers by becoming one of the youngest artistic directors in the country			2
" if you have a sense that you want to make the world change , then you 've got to go and do it			0
you ca n't ask somebody else to change the world for you			0
" it 's hard not to be intimidated by @entity18 before meeting her			1
her illustrious career has seen her open and run theater houses across the country , such as the @entity85 and @entity86			0
directing over 100 productions including the @entity88 , the @entity89 , @entity90 , the @entity91 , the @entity92 in @entity93 while in the @entity95 , she has worked with some of industry 's finest thespians , including sir @entity98 and sir @entity99			1
but as @entity18 enters her glass office , i 'm immediately struck by how her theatrical aura and energetic spirit fills the room			1
wearing a sleek black dress over her petite frame , she crosses her legs showing off a simple pair of sneakers -- an unlikely combination that works			0
wasting no time , she delves into her passion for combining education with the arts			0
" i believe wholeheartedly that in terms of human progress , arts education and arts and cultural expression is a key part of how great societies develop , " says @entity18			1
as she leans forward , she talks of creativity being the key to helping troubled youth -- a path she can relate to			0
" my experience [ is ] that if i had n't found that sense of purpose and identification , and had a way of doing it , that my life could have turned out differently			0
" " to lose any generation because they have n't been able to fulfill their potential is a tragedy , " she adds			0
so far , during her tenure as head of @entity42 and a once wayward teen herself -- she has made it her mission to provide a space for young people to express themselves			1
to that end , @entity1 's largest arts center is currently undergoing a massive refurbishment to develop a festival wing which will include a youth village , a children 's future center , arts education studios and a backstage space for emerging djs , dancers , filmmakers and photographers to cultivate their skills			1
additionally , the cultural hub offers a schools - in - residence program giving educational institutions the opportunity to move all of their classes to the @entity42 location and immerse the students with the subjects while on the premises			1
" we are also working with all kinds of urban artists -- hip - hop artists , graffiti artists , parkour , bmx riders -- sort of merging of culture , leisure and art so that young people have a route in [ to the arts ] via the thing that excites them			0
" but @entity18 's commitment to ensuring the art world is inclusive goes one step further			1
not content with the investment made in shaping female minds of the future , in 2011 @entity18 established the @entity191 ( @entity192 ) festival			1
held each march in honor of @entity195 , it 's an event she calls " a celebration of everything women and girls can do , have done and could do			2
" the week - long festival provides an opportunity for women to come together , share success stories and network			2
it has proven so popular that the @entity192 festival has spread to a number of cities across the globe , most recently in @entity211 and @entity212			2
" women very often have been amazing pioneers in a sense of saying here 's something that is clearly missing on the landscape and it needs somebody to roll their sleeves up and make it happen , " says @entity18			1
" i 'm not saying it 's only women that pioneer in the arts , but i think that people would be shocked to understand just how many women have put in the scaffolding upon which current arts policy has been created			2
" from @entity233 , a @entity1 conductor and member of the suffrage movement , to @entity236 , a theatrical producer who opened @entity43 's @entity237 , @entity18 admits , as an artistic director , she has often looked to female role models for inspiration			1
these days @entity18 herself has become somewhat of a pioneer of the arts			1
she sat on the @entity243 , represents @entity1 on cultural affairs within @entity245 and is the founder and chair of @entity248 , an artistic laboratory			2
in 1997 she received the honor of @entity251 ( @entity251 ) for her services to @entity1 arts and culture			0
and in february , @entity18 was named one of the 100 most powerful women in @entity1 by @entity257 's women 's hour			1
while she does n't recognize her work as revolutionary , she does believe she has been part of a larger shift in the @entity1 's cultural landscape			0
" i think i have been part of a transformative movement , a pioneering movement of people saying that we must never underestimate what human beings are capable of			0
" we have got a right , a duty to make more space , more time , more opportunity for the many and not the few			0
