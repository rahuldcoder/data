a little over 26 years ago , @entity0 started manufacturing auto parts in @entity2			1

@entity0 's success has also earned him seats on the country 's @entity8 and the board of directors of the @entity11			1
it has also made him a leading voice in @entity2 's efforts to re-energize its struggling economy			1
like many of his country 's business leaders , @entity0 has watched the recent negotiations with world powers on @entity2 's nuclear program with great interest			1
he spoke to @entity24 's @entity23 on this week 's @entity25 , sharing his thoughts on how he sees the talks panning out and the impact they will have on the @entity2 economy going forward			1
@entity23 ( @entity30 ) : what was your reaction when they could n't reach a deal ( on the nuclear issue ) ? @entity0 ( @entity37 ) : as a matter of fact it was a deal but naturally it takes time and we are happy that it is continuing			2
@entity30 : would you agree that @entity2 's economy is not going to improve without the sanctions being lifted ? @entity37 : it 's a very difficult question to answer because at the same time during the sanctions we tried to find our own way to improve ourselves and so on			1
but we are interested to collaborate with them ( the international community ) so it is an obstacle that should be removed			2
@entity30 : tell me about @entity2 's economy today , where does it stand ? @entity37 : these three months of the year , the first quarter of the @entity2 year , the international trade has increased from $ 18.5 billion to $ 24.5 billion			1
we hope after removing the sanctions then we 'll have at least 6 % growth in the economy of the country and at least 10 % growth in the industrial ( sector )			1
@entity30 : @entity2 is still dependent on oil exports			2
that 's been almost halved because of the sanctions			2
then we have the banking sanctions			0
how can @entity2 's economy thrive if they 're cut off from the banking system ? @entity37 : the banking system is one of the main points that we hope will be removed very soon			1
we have found our own way but the best way is to go through the normal way where the cost is much lower and it is more normal			0
@entity30 : do you sense over this past year when relations have thawed with the west that investors and businessmen and women want to come to @entity2 to invest ? @entity37 : exactly , after and even before this we see a lot of delegations come from all over the world			2
all of them are ready , they are interested , they are eager to come here and work with us			0
@entity30 : @entity2 's position is they have made enough concessions , that they 're nuclear program is open for inspections			1
even so , a deal was n't struck			0
why are you so optimistic that eventually a deal will happen ? @entity37 : for sure it will happen			0
why ? because we are a peaceful people			0
we have a capable country			0
we have more than four million students at university			0
we have the natural resources			0
we are ready and we are open for collaboration with the world			0
