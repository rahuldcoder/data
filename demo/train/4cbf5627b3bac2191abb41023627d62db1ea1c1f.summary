we 're in a prison run by @entity6 militants here in northern @entity7			1
the @entity6 wo n't allow us to see the cells where the prisoners are being held			1
their prisoners , they say , are members of @entity11			1
when the first detainee sits down , i ask the guard to please remove his blindfold			0
he blinks in the bright light and clearly looks surprised to see a foreigner sitting in front of him			0
the second prisoner who arrives trembled with fear when he was brought in			0
i introduce myself to each detainee as an @entity23 journalist			0
" you do n't have to talk if you do n't feel comfortable , " i add			0
each man speaks , though some cast darting glances at the prison guards who watch each interview			2
a man named @entity31 says he 's from @entity7 , and claims that he was forced to join @entity11 out of fears for his family 's safety			1
he says he never traveled to @entity11 - controlled territory , but confesses to being part of an @entity11 cell that planted and detonated a remote control car bomb outside a @entity6 base in this @entity6 enclave			1
he believes the bomb killed his own nephew -- and says he received about $ 3,600 for the job			1
" they said they were fighting for @entity48 and justice , " @entity31 tells us			0
" they were lying to us			0
they took advantage of our minds and our poverty			0

the terror group has been locked in a battle with @entity6 forces in the northern @entity7 border town of @entity68 since mid-september			1
the @entity23 and its allies are bombing @entity11 positions there , but airstrikes have yet to pry @entity68 from the group 's hands			1

his name is @entity79 , and he says he 's 19 years old			2
@entity79 tells me he was paid $ 2,000 to fight alongside @entity11 on the @entity7 frontlines for more than a year -- and he has the battle scars to prove it			1
lifting up his shirt , he reveals a gruesome pink and brown scar on his stomach			0
" i was shot in the stomach three times , " he says			0
he also has ugly scars on his right arm from another bullet wound			0
he claims @entity11 drugged fighters before they went into battle			1
" they gave us drugs , " @entity79 says			0
" hallucinogenic pills that would make you go to battle not caring if you live or die			0
" @entity79 says he fought for a year all across @entity11 - controlled territory			2
he says other fighters he was with were promised wives by @entity11			1
most of the fighters were foreigners , he says , and he had difficulty communicating with them because they did n't speak the local @entity7 dialect of @entity106			1
@entity79 says he even met a fighter from @entity108 at one point			1
before his capture by the @entity6 , @entity79 claims he saw @entity11 behead many of its prisoners			1
" whenever @entity11 goes into an area ... the people there who do n't adhere to their @entity48 law are apostates , " he says			2
" everything has to follow @entity11 ' way			2
even women who do n't cover their faces ... women would get their heads chopped off			0
" the final prisoner was @entity124 , a former teacher and father of two who also confessed to a car bombing			0
i ask @entity124 what he would have done if he 'd found me while he was on patrol with @entity11			2
" your fate would be death , " he tells me			0
" and there are different kinds of death -- they would torture you for sure , they might decapitate you , or cut off your hands			0
they will not simply shoot a bullet in your head			0

it 's impossible for @entity151 to confirm whether anything the prisoners told us was true -- or whether these men had merely been coached on what to say by their captors			1
they also appeared to have little information about what was going on in the outside world			0
one of the men , @entity31 , looks shocked when i tell him that a @entity23 - led coalition that includes @entity163 and the @entity164 is conducting an aerial campaign bombarding @entity11 targets			2
" i hope they kill all of them , " @entity31 says , with what appear to be tears welling in his eyes			0
all three men say it was a mistake to join @entity11			2
and they are begging their @entity6 captors for forgiveness			2
but the @entity6 guards running this prison say that if set free , every one of these men would likely go back and rejoin @entity11 .			1
