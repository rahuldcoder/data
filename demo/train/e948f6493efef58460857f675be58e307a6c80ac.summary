-- weapons , creepy critters and bodily fluids are timeless sources of inspiration for children 's toys			2
but perhaps no franchise capitalized on all those themes better than " @entity10 , " the gross - out trading cards of the 1980s that parodied @entity12			1
to many from that generation , they were the raddest cards your parents would n't let you have			2
or , maybe you found ways to procure them on your own and became the coolest kid at the lunch table			2
those kids are now adults , and the release of a book that compiles " @entity10 " art allows fans to stroll down a blood - soaked , snot - infested memory lane -- one littered with pudgy limbs and heads that bear a disturbing resemblance to the wholesome @entity12 dolls			1
" they fell into a genre that works really well for boys , ( one that ) that capitalizes on the gross - out , icky , hysterical factor , " said @entity32 , spokeswoman for the @entity33			1
" this is how young boys play			0
that 's what they find funny and trading cards continue to be popular , affordable options			1
kids love to collect , so combining several areas that appeal to kids makes a lot of sense for that specific audience			0
" trading card company @entity53 launched the first set of " @entity10 " in 1985 as a follow - up to the grotesque creatures of @entity57 and the product parody @entity59 , which recast products like @entity61 as " @entity62			1
" that history was the " amniotic fluid that the @entity10 floated in " before their release , wrote cartoonist @entity64 , part of the creative team that produced @entity59			1
the series found quick success with sales at convenience stores and toy stores -- and sparked immediate outrage among parents who did n't see the joke in characters like @entity79 , a chain - smoking , nose - picking baby surrounded by cups of coffee and soda bottles , or @entity85 , a girl with her head in a guillotine			1
" @entity10 offered something that was not so benign and parent - friendly , " @entity64 wrote in the book 's forward			1
" rather , it provoked : ' @entity94 , what is that ? where did you get those ? your allowance is cut off			0
' the dolls were pricey and had to appeal to adults			0
the stickers were available for chump change and appealed to the inner beast in all kids			0
" even the publisher that released @entity64 's @entity108 - winning graphic novel , " @entity109 : a @entity114 , " in 1986 expressed relief that his name was n't attached to the images			1
" ' if this gets out , they 'll review your book and call it ' @entity121 , ' " @entity64 said his editor at @entity116 told him at the time			1
somehow , the cards found their way into the homes of children and @entity53 released five series from 1985 to 1986			1
" @entity132 " was released in 1987 to widespread criticism , with the movie rating website @entity129 calling it a " hastily - assembled live - action film " meant to capitalize on " that childish joy in the disgusting			2
" another version is reportedly in the works from @entity136 's @entity135			0
or , as @entity64 put it : " we were trying to help another generation of juvenile delinquents come of age , to offer them a counterculture			1
but not one that was counter to our @entity145 -- we 're talking about the bubblegum counter			0
this was @entity53 , after all			0
" topps asked various artists to contribute sketches of ideas , including @entity59 veteran and underground cartoonist @entity153			1
" @entity154 said to make the kids gross , nasty , disgusting and rebellious , and i saw that shock value was a huge part of the idea , " @entity153 told @entity0			1
" but as i worked on the sketches , i realized i also wanted the kids and artwork to feel good to look at			0
@entity53 had n't asked for that , but i needed it , so i would enjoy making the art , and so people would enjoy seeing the stickers			0
" @entity167 estimates he generated about half of the sketches for the first series , with others sketched out by @entity53 artists including @entity172			2
@entity167 started with a quick doodles , to see how to best pose the character and the action and then drew it full - size , filing in all the details			2
once @entity53 ok 'd the image , he did a quick color study on another copy of the pencil art before painting in acrylics on paper , working from light colors to darker ones			0
" because i could only spend a few hours per painting , i came up with an organized process , that was like doing a jigsaw puzzle			0
first i painted the shapes for the flesh and hair			0
and then i airbrushed the background , " @entity153 said in an e-mail			2
for each series , @entity53 came up with the names after the paintings were done , though sometimes @entity153 wrote ideas for names in the margins around the paintings , he said			1
" the name @entity10 was easy to understand , as a parody of the famous @entity12			2
the @entity10 jokes were lowbrow humor for kids , gross and rebellious , something most parents would n't like			1
and i believe the art was appealing , despite the subject matter , " he said			0
his favorites ? " today , i 'm liking @entity216 , with her mellow , old world glow			0
maybe it 's because of her chubby hands and cheeks and smug smile , " he said			0
" and @entity223 , because he looks so , well , presidential , and good - natured , for a @entity10			1
what kind of damage could he possibly do ? because after all , he 's just a cute little doll , at the @entity228 podium			0
" who was your favorite character ? tell us in the comments !			0
