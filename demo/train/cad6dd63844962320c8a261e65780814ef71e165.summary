it could be billed as the billionaires ' derby			0
a clash between @entity5 and @entity6 on tuesday signals the business end in this season 's @entity11 's money - spinning @entity9 competition has landed			1
@entity5 , a comfortable leader in the @entity14 , faces off against @entity6 , which is in contention for a third successive league crown in @entity17			1
among its many intriguing plot lines is a battle between two of football 's biggest egos : @entity5 's irascible , but eminently quotable , manager @entity24 , and @entity6 striker @entity25 , a walking well of self confidence			1
it also sees the @entity31 club 's @entity29 owner @entity28 put his expensively assembled side up against an equally star - studded @entity34 outfit , which is owned by @entity35			2
throw in a chance for @entity6 to avenge its elimination from last year 's competition at the quarterfinal stage , and @entity40 meeting the side that sold him to the @entity34 club for a reported fee of $ 76 million in may , and it has all the makings of a classic			2
who has the biggest ego out of @entity24 and @entity25 ? how long have you got ? these two possess such magnetic personalities a simple televised conversation between them on @entity1 would probably attract an audience of millions			1
of course , @entity24 is the man who arrived for his first spell at @entity5 after having guided @entity53 to the @entity9 title and promptly informed the @entity56 press that he was " a special one			1
" a litany of trophies has followed in his subsequent stints at @entity62 club @entity61 -- a haul that included another @entity9 title -- and @entity66 giants @entity65 , but also a long charge sheet of controversy			2
as well as a series of spats with fellow managers , @entity24 famously poked then @entity73 assistant manager @entity72 in the eye after a touchline melee -- this a few seasons after he charged onto the @entity78 pitch to celebrate @entity61 's victory over @entity73 in a @entity9 semifinal			1
@entity25 is as good a match as any for @entity24 's ego in the game of soccer			1
richly talented , and as enigmatic as they come , the @entity85 recently suggested a statue of him could replace the @entity88			0
his recent autobiography ' i am @entity25 ' was utterly self - aggrandizing and all the more entertaining for it , filled with hubris along the same lines as his response when asked what gift he would get his girlfriend for her birthday			2
" nothing , " he replied			0
" she already has @entity25			2
" he has played for a selection of the world 's biggest clubs -- @entity104 , @entity73 , @entity61 , as well as @entity105 , and now @entity6 -- scoring spectacular goals wherever he has been			2
the @entity107 managed @entity25 for just one solitary season when they were at @entity61 together , the latter saying in his book : " @entity24 would become a guy i was basically willing to die for			1
" at the end of the 2008/09 season , @entity61 having won @entity114 for the third straight season and @entity25 finishing as the league 's top scorer with 25 goals , the @entity85 left for @entity73 in search of a @entity9 crown			1
but it was @entity24 and @entity61 who won it the following season			2
now the pair go head - to - head ; @entity25 is yet to win @entity11 's top club prize , @entity24 is gunning for his third			1
how rich are the clubs ' respective owners ? mega-rich			0
@entity28 made his money from the controversial privatization of the @entity29 oil fields and is currently worth an estimated $ 9 billion , according to @entity134			2
after purchasing the club in 2003 @entity28 transformed them from also - ran into a major force with a series of lavish spending sprees on players , outlaying nearly $ 3bn in his first 10 years			2
notoriously reticent , the 48 - year - old has never offered any public statement or fluff piece on the club 's website to explain any of his decisions , one of which was to hand @entity24 a huge payoff at the end of his first stint at the club			2
though the @entity107 delivered a first @entity153 in over 50 years during his first season at the helm , it was the @entity9 crown that @entity28 desperately craved			1
after running through a series of high - profile managers since , @entity5 's first ever @entity9 was actually delivered by a caretaker manager and former player -- @entity160 , who took over after @entity161 was sacked after just nine months at the helm			1
even after delivering the ultimate prize , @entity160 himself lasted just three months the following season before he was dismissed by the @entity29			0
recently , @entity28 has curtailed his extravagant spending to ensure @entity5 complies with @entity166 ( @entity166 ) , a directive from @entity170 football 's governing body that insists all clubs must live within its means			1
@entity5 have recouped around $ 215 million in recent seasons through player sales , a large chunk of which came through the sale of @entity40 to @entity6 , and recorded a profit for the second successive year to the end of june 2014			1
@entity28 has n't put the brakes on his own spending though , his $ 1bn super yacht a reminder of his vast personal wealth			2
there are many similarities between @entity28 and @entity6 's owners -- @entity35 ( @entity35 )			1
it has vast reserves -- an estimated $ 200 billion -- and also craves a @entity9 crown			2
it is being forced to curtail spending after being hit with a fine by @entity11 for failing to meet the criteria set out by @entity166			0
after @entity193 purchased 70 % of the club in june 2011 , and became the sole shareholder the following year , @entity6 was transformed into one of the world 's richest clubs overnight			0
like @entity28 , it invested heavily in the playing squad -- purchasing the likes of @entity201 and @entity25 -- and was rewarded in 2013 with @entity6 's first league title for 19 years			1
despite defending its @entity17 crown last season , success on the @entity170 scene continues to elude it			0
it has been knocked out at the last eight stage in the last two seasons , by @entity73 in 2012/13 and by @entity5 in 2013/14			0
coach @entity209 is presiding over an injury crisis at present but the tie with @entity5 could be the deciding factor as to whether he continues in his job beyond the end of the season			0
who will be the key protagonists ? leaving aside the wealth of attacking options on display , there is one man who is certain to attract plenty of attention -- @entity40			0
the @entity225 defender spent three years with @entity5 , and was part of the squad that won the @entity9 in 2012 , but turned down a new contract to join @entity6 for a fee of around $ 76 million			1
his defensive prowess was the focus of much attention in the @entity14 , one pundit saying @entity40 operated on the field as if he was being controlled by " a 10 - year - old on a @entity236			0
" prone to abandoning his defensive station and pouring forward when deployed at the back , @entity24 moved the 27 - year - old into midfield for the majority of last season			0
this two - legged tie could go either way for the @entity225 : either @entity40 proves his former club made a mistake in letting him go with a barnstorming performance , or those trademark lapses in concentration will confirm the belief that @entity5 pulled off an outstanding piece of business			0
@entity40 will be tasked with shackling @entity253 , @entity5 's new striker who has taken to the @entity14 like a duck to water , scoring 17 goals already to help the @entity257 carve out a seven - point lead over @entity259			1
@entity260 is the man who supplies most of @entity253 's goals after joining from @entity73 in june , while @entity24 has stiffened @entity5 's resolve in defense , veteran skipper @entity265 key to its parsimonious nature			1
as for @entity6 , after two years of outright dominance in @entity17 , it is stuttering this season			1
even before a crippling injury crisis recently took hold , it had been criticized for under performing and currently sits third in the table , behind @entity272 and @entity273			0
sunday 's draw with @entity275 was a case in point			0
leading 2 - 0 at halftime it lost four players to injury and having run out of substitutes , its nine men could n't prevent slumping to a 2 - 2 draw			0
@entity25 is still its talisman , and his striker partner @entity284 will also be important in the absence of so many players			1
it is hoped @entity287 will recover in time to feature against @entity5 , while @entity288 will have to take on extra responsibility given its depleted ranks			0
what happened last time they met ? quite simply , @entity6 should have won			0
it secured a 3 - 1 lead in the first leg at the @entity295 after goals from @entity201 and @entity284 were added to a by a @entity40 own goal			0
@entity5 took the lead in the return leg through @entity300 -- recently sold to @entity302 club @entity301 -- but were struggling to conjure any chances as the game entered its final moments			0
but substitute @entity306 popped up to bundle the ball home in the 87th minute to spark wild scenes of celebration at @entity311 and send @entity24 sprinting down the touchline to pass on some tactical instructions in the aftermath			0
@entity5 would fall at the next stage , beaten 3 - 1 on aggregate by @entity66 champions @entity317 , which succumbed to city rivals real in the final			0
this is @entity24 's fifth attempt at securing the @entity9 crown for @entity5 , but will he succeed this year ?			1
