-- getting ahead in your career is not just about being successful ; it 's about being noticed			1
so how do you stand out to be hired by potential employers ? how do you stand out for a promotion to a superior ? how do you stand out as loyal to the people you are leading ? it 's simple : do the things that others are n't willing to do			1
whether you 're a leader , a team member , or a candidate , success comes from having the discipline to do the things that you know you should be doing , even when you do n't feel like doing them			1
when you practice this kind of self discipline regularly , you 'll naturally stand out from the pack -- because most people avoid the hard stuff			1
it 's just easier to put it off			2
but the truth is that what feels easy now creates problems down the line			2
and what feels hard now -- doing the stuff you do n't feel like -- makes everything easier in the long - term			1
self discipline does n't have to be hard -- you just have to change the way you think about it			1

i 've spent the last 10 years studying and coaching some of the most successful people in business , figuring out what makes them different			1
they 're not smarter or more talented than the average person -- they just consistently do what others are n't willing to do by keeping three principles in mind : do it scared			1
fear is one of the biggest saboteurs of our goals , because it inhibits action			2
the next time you feel yourself putting something off because you 're afraid -- of uncertainty or failure -- just " do it scared			1
" i once heard a true story of a woman who was trapped in a burning building on the 80th floor			2
she was terrified of heights and enclosed spaces , and when the fire alarm went off , she refused to follow her colleagues into the stairwell to evacuate to safety			2
the firemen did a sweep of the building and found her hiding under her desk , waiting to die			2
she was screaming " i 'm scared , i 'm scared ! " as the firemen insisted she walk down the stairwell			2
until one fireman said : " that 's ok , just do it scared			2
" he repeated it all the way down the 80 flights of stairs , until he brought her to safety			2
we 've all faced these moments in our careers -- when you know what has to be done , but your fear holds you back			2
in order to stand out , you must develop the habit of acting in the face of fear			0
it 's fine to be scared -- do it scared			0
it 's fine to be unsure -- do it unsure			0
it 's fine to be uncomfortable -- do it uncomfortable			0
this is the attitude of the most disciplined and successful people on the planet			1
they might be scared , but they do it anyways			0
and by just doing something , you create movement and momentum that will lead to progress and results			0

perfectionism is one of the most common reasons people procrastinate , and we 've all done it at some point			1
the best way to overcome this impulse is to put your self esteem into stellar work habits instead of results			0
it can take a while to see the fruits of your labor -- whether you 're spearheading a new initiative , trying to launch a business , or planning a second act career			1
to keep yourself motivated , take pride in sticking to your work habits , rather than looking for immediate results			0
in time , success will follow			0
the pursuit of any goal will inevitably face a number of obstacles			0
the difference between those who stand out in the careers and those who blend in lies in what you do when you reach these critical turning points			0
do you hesitate and turn back ? or do you press forward ? when you feel frustrated , depressed , or disappointed , do n't give up -- just get some perspective			1
i have a mental reminder that helps me push past these hurdles			0
i hold my pen up to my eye and stare directly down the barrel			0
then , i pull it away and look at it in its entirety			0
it 's a quick way to remind myself to look at my life in the same way			0
stop fixating on the here and now , and think about the big picture			1
today 's challenges may not make sense , but you must have faith that over the long - term , they will be nothing more than blips on the radar screen			0
having this perspective and faith will help you press forward at the moments when others turn back			0
contrary to popular belief , people who have reached the highest levels in their careers are n't necessarily better educated , more talented or better connected			1
neither are they simply more motivated or harder workers			0
rather , successful people have realized that getting to the top means that they first have to do the things that they do n't want to do related to their goals			1
it 's not about enjoying self discipline -- it 's about adopting a few new ways of thinking that simply make discipline easier to endure			0
and when you develop the habit of doing things that others wo n't do , you 're putting yourself on the fast track to the route to the top			1
