@entity0 is associate professor of politics and african - american studies at @entity3			1
she is the author of the award - winning book " @entity6 , and @entity7 : @entity10 and @entity11 , " and writes a daily blog titled @entity9			2
@entity0 says black politics has come of age , with blacks as equal partners in electing @entity16			1
@entity17 , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) -- it seems @entity21 has been irritated with @entity16 for a long time			1
@entity21 is perhaps the most recognizable @entity23 - @entity22 journalist in the country			1
he is a fixture on radio and television , and has authored several books that are best - sellers among black readers			1
one might suspect that @entity21 would be enthusiastic about the opportunities presented by @entity22 's election of a black president			1
instead , @entity21 seems annoyed			0
in february 2008 , @entity21 denounced then - candidate @entity16 for failing to make a personal appearance at @entity21 's annual @entity35			1
his continuing criticism of sen. @entity16 during the fall campaign produced substantial outcry from listeners of the @entity40 , a popular radio program where @entity21 had been a well - liked regular			1
after @entity16 's election , @entity21 published a text titled " @entity43 " and has repeatedly indicated his intention to hold president @entity16 " accountable " to an explicitly racial agenda			1
the specific policies suggested by @entity21 's books are not substantially different from those of the @entity16 administration , but @entity21 insists on explicit and repeated acknowledgement of race , while @entity16 typically seeks to address inequality within a racially neutral frame			1
despite writing about race in both of his books , addressing race in the historic @entity59 speech during the @entity61 primary and repeatedly acknowledging that racial inequality endures , @entity21 's critique implies that @entity16 's approach to race is both inadequate and inauthentic			1
on may 24 , @entity65 aired the latest installment of @entity21 's accountability campaign : a two - hour documentary titled " stand			2
" recycling @entity72 's @entity71 film , " @entity73 , " @entity21 assembled a group of prominent black male public figures for a bus ride through the @entity77			2
ostensibly , this bus trip would provide @entity21 , professors @entity79 and @entity81 , @entity82 and others an opportunity to reflect on the meaningful upheavals in @entity22 society and politics in the summer of 2008			1
" stand " was an enormous disappointment			0
its low production value , wandering narrative , flat history and self - important egoism did little to reveal the shortcomings of the @entity16 phenomenon			1
instead , the piece exposed and embodied the contemporary crisis of the black public intellectual in the age of @entity16			1
the film and its participants ( two of them my senior colleagues at @entity3 ) appropriated the legacy of the rev. @entity106 to implicitly claim that they , not @entity16 , are the authentic representatives of the political interests of african - americans			1
they used @entity106 's images and speeches , gathered on the balcony where @entity106 was assassinated , and explicitly asserted their desire to play @entity106 to @entity16 's @entity114 , and @entity115 to @entity16 's @entity116			1
on its face , this is not a bad model			0
presidents are deeply constrained by the structural and political limitations of their office			0
a robust administration needs an active and informed citizenry to engage , push , cajole , criticize and applaud its efforts			0
but this appropriation misrepresents rather than preserves @entity106 's legacy			0
@entity106 was a powerful questioner and , at times , ally of president @entity114 because he was at the helm of a massive social movement of men and women who were shut out of the ordinary political process			0
it was not @entity106 's intellectual capacity or verbal dexterity that made him an effective advocate for racial issues ; it was his own accountability to that movement			2
this is not true of @entity21 and his " soul patrol , " who are mostly public personalities and tenured professors largely unaccountable to the black constituency			2
@entity106 's meager income , though supplemented by the lecture circuit , was grounded in the voluntary contributions of black churchgoers			2
@entity21 is backed by powerful corporations , like @entity153 and @entity154 , that have troubled relationships with these communities			0
the college profs on the bus are comfortably supported by well - endowed universities			2
this does not invalidate their views on race , but it does make the analogy with @entity106 a poor fit			0
further , @entity21 and his " soul patrol " seemed to have missed the intervening 40 years between the era of @entity106 and the election of @entity16			1
african - americans are no longer fully disfranchised subjects of an oppressive state			2
african - americans are now citizens capable of running for office , holding officials accountable through democratic elections , publicly expressing divergent political preferences and , most importantly , engaging the full spectrum of @entity22 political issues , not only narrowly racial ones			1
the era of racial brokerage politics , when the voices of a few men stood in for the entire race , is now over			1
and thank goodness it is over			0
black politics is growing up			1
the men of " stand " yearned for an imagined racial past			0
by their accounting , this racial past had better music , more charismatic leaders and a more - involved black church			1
their romanticism ignores the cultural contributions of contemporary black youth , forgets the dangerous limitations of charismatic leadership and revises the fraught , complicated relationship of black churches to struggles for racial equality			2
and these men ignored the democratizing effect of new media forms , which revolutionized the 2008 election			0
black people were not duped by some slick , media - generated candidate			2
african - americans were co-authors of the @entity16 campaign			1
through social networks , @entity216 videos , political blogs and new - media echo chambers , black people were equal partners in shaping the candidate and his campaign			1
there was no need for the entrenched pundit class to tell black voters what to think or how to behave ; they figured it out for themselves			0
still , there is plenty to criticize in the young @entity16 administration : the refusal to prosecute those implicated in the torture memos , civilian casualties caused by drone attacks , bank bailouts and inadequate defense of gay rights to name a few			2
but black communities are already engaged in these critiques and many others			0
black local organizers , elected officials , bloggers , pundits and columnists have taken substantive , specific positions on a broad range of issues			0
in black communities , nonprofit organizations continue to work for justice , and charities still try to fill the gap during tough economic times			0
african - americans are engaged as mature citizens ought to be : in both discourse and action			0
this political maturity is precisely the source of the black public intellectual crisis : what do @entity21 and the @entity266 add to this process ? their bus never stopped at a @entity272 site to build a home or at a soup kitchen to serve the hungry			0
their dialogue centered more on the relative merits of @entity278 vs. @entity279 than on meaningful political issues			0
though they spoke with elders , their self - congratulatory revelry never paused to engage any elected officials , issues specialists or local activists			0
and while they talked a great deal about women , they never spoke to a woman			0
" stand " was sad because i still believe in a role for black public intellectuals			0
scholars and journalists often have a particular capacity for curiosity , questioning and issue synthesis that has real value in public discourse			0
it was painfully clear that this particular accountability crusade is not informed by any of those skills			0
instead , it seems determined to stand in the way of the maturation of @entity23 - @entity22 politics in order to maintain personal power			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			2

@entity0 : some have said @entity16 should be held to racial agenda
she says *nostalgia* for the old days of *protest* *obscures* last election
black politics has come of age , and @entity23 - @entity22 are equal partners , she says
