-- sen. @entity1 , the son of libertarian - leaning @entity3 @entity2 , threw some red meat to the @entity6 crowd wednesday night by counting up the increase in the debt under the @entity10 administration			1
" president @entity10 's administration will add nearly $ 6 trillion to our national debt in just one term , " said @entity2 , whom @entity12 voters sent to the @entity13 in 2010			1
the facts : the national debt -- the cumulative tab run up by the @entity21 government over its lifetime -- stood at $ 10.6 trillion when @entity10 took office in january 2009			1
it 's currently running at nearly $ 16 trillion , according to the @entity25			2
the @entity27 estimates project another $ 600 billion budget shortfall for the 2013 fiscal year			0
that would make a $ 6 trillion increase in a single term , as @entity2 says			1
fact check : @entity34 misleads on debt panel 's spending cut but there are some catches			2
first off , @entity10 governed for much of the first nine months of his administration under the last budget of the @entity42 administration			2
but he did push an $ 800 billion - plus economic stimulus program through @entity46 early in his term , some of which was spent before that budget year ended in october			2
@entity42 's original budget proposal predicted a $ 407 billion deficit for 2009 , but the final figure was $ 1.4 trillion , according to @entity52 figures			0
spending has gone up under the @entity10 administration : for the 2011 fiscal year , the second full budget of @entity10 's term , the federal government spent about $ 3.6 trillion , according to the @entity52 budget office			1
that 's about $ 600 million more than in 2008 , the last full year under the @entity42 administration			0
but the budget gap has another element : tax revenues have dropped during the 2007 - 2009 recession and remain lower than before			0
in the 2007 budget year , which ended shortly before the recession began , the federal government brought in nearly $ 2.6 trillion ; that number fell to $ 2.1 trillion in 2009 and is projected to total $ 2.4 trillion by the time this budget year ends in september			0
the verdict : true , but incomplete			0
while budget shortfalls have added $ 6 trillion to the national debt since january 2009 , some of that spending was already in the pipeline , and some of it is the result of the economic slump that has cut into tax receipts			1
fact check : did @entity34 get @entity10 's @entity82 speech right ? @entity83 and @entity84 contributed to this report .			0
