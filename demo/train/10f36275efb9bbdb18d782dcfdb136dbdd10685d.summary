during monday night 's foreign - policy focused presidential debate , president @entity0 made the case that @entity4 in @entity5 is decimated while former @entity7 gov. @entity6 argued they are on the rise in other countries : the claims : @entity0 : @entity4 's core leadership has been decimated			1
@entity6 : this is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries , and it presents an enormous threat to our friends , to the world , to @entity19 , long term , and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism			2
fact check : @entity6 , @entity0 and @entity25 the facts : there 's no disputing that @entity4 's leader , @entity29 , was killed in 2011 in a highly successful mission in @entity5 approved by @entity0			1
@entity6 has tipped his hat to the military and intelligence professionals who orchestrated that raid			2
the @entity0 administration also dramatically upped the operation of armed unmanned aircraft in @entity5 , with nearly 300 strikes so far and greatly increased the number of @entity4 and other extremists taken off the battlefield			1
most of those killed were foot soldiers , but besides @entity29 , some of the key players killed in recent years include : @entity46 , the no. 2 to current leader @entity47 ; @entity48 , no. 3 in the hierarchy ; and @entity50 , the leader of @entity4 in @entity25			2
although @entity0 at times speaks more broadly about @entity4 being on the run , his top national security team has consistently zeroed in on @entity4 's core leadership , which is hiding out in @entity5			1
@entity0 was careful to specify that in this last debate			2
fact check : comparing costs of @entity25 , @entity61 missions just last month , national counterterrorism director @entity62 said , " the intelligence picture shows that @entity4 's core is a shadow of its former self and the overall threat from @entity4 in @entity5 is diminished			1
" defense secretary @entity68 predicted last year after the @entity29 strike that if the @entity19 keeps up the pressure , " i 'm convinced that we 're within reach of strategically defeating @entity4 , " again a reference to the @entity5 - based leaders			1
what 's worrisome are @entity4 affiliates in @entity77 , @entity78 and elsewhere in the @entity79			1
" even as @entity4 's leadership in @entity5 struggles to remain relevant , the terrorist threat we face has become more diverse , " @entity80 said			1
" @entity4 has turned to other groups to carry out attacks and to advance its ideology			0
these groups are based in an array of countries , including @entity77 , @entity89 , @entity90 and in @entity25			2
" of particular concern is @entity92 , which operates in @entity77			0
when @entity0 took office in 2009 , @entity92 was a newly formed affiliate , the result of a merger between @entity4 forces fleeing @entity97 and jihadists in @entity77			1
a locally focused group quickly became a more powerful @entity4 franchise soon plotting attacks outside @entity77 's borders			2
first there was the failed attempt by a suicide bomber in the summer of 2009 to kill the @entity97 prince who ran the country 's counterterrorism campaign			0
by the end of that year , @entity92 was behind the attempt by @entity111 to blow up a @entity113 flight as it approached @entity114 on christmas day			0
plans by @entity92 to blow up cargo planes destined for the @entity19 in 2010 and to put a suicide bomber aboard a passenger aircraft earlier this year were thwarted by @entity19 and allied intelligence services			0
fact check : @entity6 against @entity121 2012 deadline ? @entity92 and @entity126 , the affiliated extremist group in @entity89 , have been under sustained pressure by government and regional forces with assistance from the @entity19 , but cia director @entity131 said at a congressional hearing earlier this year that although @entity92 , @entity126 and others have " sustained important losses ... the threat of terrorism remains significant and we must sustain the campaign , we must maintain the pressure on @entity4 and its affiliates			1
" the @entity138 has resulted in fundamental changes in many parts of the region , but the continued instability and fledgling governments also prevent an opportunity for terrorists			0
" @entity4 was not part of this change , but the group is seeking to take advantage of the unrest in some areas , seeking to establish safe havens and recruit extremists where security is diminished , " @entity80 said			0
of particular concern are large swaths of @entity61 and @entity157 where extremists , some associated with @entity4 , have found refuge			0
@entity159 ( @entity159 ) , which operates in northern @entity78 , is one of the group seen to be taking advantage of the situation			0
lt. gen. @entity163 , recently retired as @entity165 director , told @entity166 that " @entity159 acquired weapons from @entity61 this year , kidnapped @entity168 and continues its support to @entity90 based @entity170			0
" @entity170 is an insurgent group in @entity90 with a goal of creating an @entity173 state in the northern part of the country			0
the unrest in @entity177 has provided an opportunity for @entity4 in @entity25 ( @entity179 ) which according to director of national intelligence @entity180 has extended its reach into the war - torn nation			0
although @entity179 's presense in @entity177 is considered small , intelligence officials worry it will grow as the chaos continues			0
@entity180 said that while @entity4 core 's in @entity5 will remain mostly a symbolic importance to the global jihadist movement , the regional affiliates " will drive the global jihad agenda			1
" fact check : @entity0 's apology tour ? the conclusion : both claims are true			2
@entity4 's core leadership has been seriously weakened , but the affiliates remain active , particularly in @entity77 and @entity78 , where the threat to @entity168 interests and plotting against the homeland remain strong			1
@entity6 's claim that @entity4 is in 10 to 12 countries is in the ballpark , and the administration would seem to agree that poses an enormous threat			1
complete coverage : @entity210 @entity209			0

@entity0 says @entity4 's core leadership in @entity5 has been severely weakened
@entity6 claims @entity4 branches have spread to almost a dozen countries
@entity4 operatives in @entity77 are particularly worrisome to @entity19
