-- seriously , how is this not already huge in the @entity2 ? according to @entity4 , selfie sticks are the must - have gift this season in @entity7			1
the pole is used to extend camera phones more than three feet away , thus allowing users to take group selfies , panoramic shots and the like			1
thousands have already been purchased in the @entity7			2
no surprise , given that 2014 is the year of the selfie -- at least , according to @entity16			0
@entity17 sticks first took off in @entity18 and , according to the @entity4 , gained popularity among extreme sports enthusiasts who started using it as a way to capture images of themselves in action			1
the @entity4 reported that " the most basic is simply as extendable pole , meaning the selfie - taker sets the phone timer to take a picture			0
but more advanced versions from Â £ 14.99 have bluetooth shutter releases on the handles which link to your smart phone , meaning you can control exactly when you take your picture			0
" it 's that @entity39 system that caused @entity41 officials to ban the use of " unregulated " selfie sticks and to declare that they might be hazardous to other devices			1
@entity45 recently wrote about the device for @entity47 under the headline " the # @entity49 may be the @entity50 ever			0
" " the selfie stick may seem solely for the extremely self - involved , but before you point fingers , or sticks , i 'm not the only one using it , " @entity45 wrote			1
" look up # selfiestick on @entity57 and almost 40,000 results of beaming couples and families holding the device appear			0
" one @entity16 user posted , " i am now the proud owner of a # selfiestick , " along with a pic of him and some mates			0
which begs the question : is it only a matter of time before the trend hops the pond , given how few @entity2 have , ahem , selfie control ?			2

" @entity17 stick " devices allow users to extend their camera phones
thousands have sold *overseas* , but not in the @entity2
@entity41 has banned " unregulated " selfie sticks with @entity39
