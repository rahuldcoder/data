@entity0 -- soldiers who just returned from @entity4 are among several thousand being ordered to @entity5 in six months as part of a mission designed to beef up @entity5 forces ahead of a planned 2014 @entity10 military withdrawal , officials said			1
news of the pending @entity5 deployments came as families at bases across the country were celebrating the return in recent days of troops who turned off the lights at a number of @entity10 bases ahead of an end - of - the - year deadline to leave @entity4			1
@entity10 general brings @entity24 standard home " we are glad that we have brought all soldiers back home in time for @entity28 to spend with loved ones			1
we do have to put information out about an upcoming mission , though , " the 4th @entity30 , 1st @entity31 , said tuesday on its @entity32			0
in the posting , the brigade said it was one of four selected to " support a @entity38 to @entity5 in early summer			2
" " we just received initial planning orders so lots of details are unknown , " it said			2
" ... the mission is part of the transition from combat operations to advisory mission as we did in @entity4 and is a sign of progress			2
" analysts : questions remain as @entity10 troops leave @entity4 maj. @entity55 , a brigade spokeswoman , confirmed the validity of the @entity32 announcement			1
the new mission is part of an overall @entity10 military exit strategy from @entity5 that moves troops from a combat role to advise - and - assist positions that commanders and analysts say will significantly scale back operations ahead of president @entity68 's self - imposed deadline to leave the country			1
earlier this year , the @entity10 outlined its plan to withdraw its troops , beginning by pulling 33,000 " surge " troops deployed to help quell the violence by the end of 2012			2
the remaining 68,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014			0
news of the deployments comes as the @entity68 administration pushes to accelerate the withdrawal of troops from @entity5 , a plan that many military commanders have said is unreasonable in a country still trying to gain its security footing			1
" i do n't think we are going to turn around guys who spent time in @entity4 and put them on planes to @entity5 ... without there being a clear indication that the @entity68 administration wants to continue the acceleration of the withdrawal , " said @entity87 , editor of @entity88 & senior fellow at @entity90			1
" @entity10 commanders want to stop with the withdrawal of the 33,000 ( surge troops			2
) they want to halt it			0
" @entity102 gen. @entity102 , commander of the @entity103 , has said he would like to keep a @entity10 " military presence " in @entity5 beyond 2014 when @entity104 is scheduled to withdraw its forces			1
@entity102 suggested the presence could last as long as 2016 when the @entity108 is completed			0
@entity102 told reporters last week there is " no daylight " between him and the @entity112 on this idea			0
@entity102 said he wants to shift the @entity10 presence to an advisory capacity in the coming months and then continue to do that mission after 2014			2
gen. @entity117 , chairman of the @entity118 , has asked @entity102 to review the counterinsurgency strategy and determine what changes are needed			0
@entity102 said he has to complete the review before he can decide on the rate of drawdown of current @entity10 force levels			2
the new mission in @entity5 somewhat mirrors the @entity10 exit strategy in @entity4 , which used advise and assist teams to improve counterterrorism operations and train security forces			1
just like in @entity4 , small teams of @entity10 troops will work and live among security forces , and will help coordinate military operations , according to comments @entity102 made to reporters last week			1
in its @entity32 posting , the 4th @entity30 said those who would be deployed in advise - and - assist roles would be senior enlisted personnel , ranging from master sergeants to colonels			0
the deployment was expected to last nine months , though it was unclear how many members of the brigade will deploy			2
also being deployed are troops from the 2nd @entity30 , @entity145 from @entity146 , @entity147 ; the @entity148 , 4th @entity145 from @entity149 , @entity150 ; and the @entity151 , @entity152 at @entity153 , @entity154			0
the brigade deployments were first reported this week by @entity156 , a newspaper that caters to military personnel			2
under an @entity161 policy , troops are given one month of dwell time for every month they are deployed			0
in the case of @entity166 's brigade , which returned in december after less than six months in @entity4 , its soldiers could be sent to @entity5 as early as may			1
the @entity167 did not immediately respond to a @entity1 request for comment			0
messages left early wednesday by @entity1 at public affairs offices at the @entity145 , the @entity172 and the @entity152 were not immediately returned			0
reactions at @entity174 were mixed with some soldiers and families telling @entity1 by telephone that they were resigned to the specter of an @entity5 deployment , while others said they were surprised elements of the brigade would be deployed so soon after returning from @entity4			1
none of the soldiers or their family members were willing to be quoted , citing possible repercussions over speaking to the media without prior approval			1
responses to the brigade 's @entity32 post , though , revealed the feelings of spouses and family members			1
" all we can do is enjoy the time we have with them , " one person wrote			0
another wrote : " not even home a week			0
" questions remain about the stability of @entity5 forces , with some questioning whether an @entity4 - style exit strategy can work in @entity5			1
" given that we are 10 years into this , my confidence level is pretty low that we can turn the @entity5 forces around , " @entity87 said			0
@entity210 must have clear representative for peace talks , @entity209 says the @entity10 - led war in @entity5 began october 7 , 2001 , with an air campaign that was followed within weeks by a ground invasion			1
president @entity68 has called it " the longest - running war in the nation 's history "			0
as the @entity10 turned its attention toward @entity4 , insurgent violence in @entity5 flared against @entity5 civilians and security forces as well as the @entity10 and its coalition partners			1
in 2009 , president @entity68 authorized a surge of 33,000 @entity10 troops to @entity5 to combat the violence			1
earlier this year , the president announced a plan to withdraw its troops			0
the move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the @entity104 nations			0
@entity1 's @entity235 contributed to this report .			0

some soldiers just back from @entity4 are heading to @entity5 , the military says
the deployments are part of an overall @entity10 exit strategy from @entity5
lots of details are unknown , one brigade tells its soldiers
family members of those soldiers just back from @entity4 have mixed feelings
