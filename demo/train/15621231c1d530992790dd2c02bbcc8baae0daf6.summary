-- " the @entity0 have spoken and my bride price is @entity3 , 000			0
i 'm a @entity5 babe na ! " knowing your worth has taken on new meaning since the launch of " @entity9 , " the app that calculates the users ' value based on answers to a series of ranked questions ranging from height and weight to leg shape and cooking skills			1
you could lose a whopping 60 % of your bride price for being a " @entity21 , " the heaviest weight category , while " sexy bow legs " a @entity23 © would add @entity24 , 000 ( $ 123 ) to your price			1
as entertaining as this quiz may be to complete , categories like skin color could be cause for concern			0
to begin with , the app uses the controversial term " half - caste , " which would add @entity35 , 000 ( $ 308 ) to your worth , just like the answer " @entity45 " -- some say this pays testament to the impact @entity40 actress @entity39 has had on the perceptions of beauty and darker skinned girls			1
while " dark " is still ranked as the second most undesirable skin color , skin bleachers are also devalued			0
the scrutiny is not over yet ; face quality is then assessed , followed by nine more categories			0
be careful in the final bonus round , you could be fined @entity54 , 000 ( $ 264 ) for being a " club girl			0
" such a controversial app comes with a disclaimer , of course			1
" @entity9 , " which was developed by @entity64 - based digital agency @entity63 , has had two million views since its release on may 25 , the vast majority of which came from women			1
people from over 180 countries have used the app , according to the company , with @entity70 , the @entity71 and the @entity72 generating the most traffic			1
the app quickly went viral after a private link was tweeted on sunday may 25 , forcing the brand to switch servers , and " @entity9 " to trend in @entity70			1
the term bride price nowadays refers to a usually symbolic amount of money or gifts given to a woman 's family by her fiance at the time of their marriage			1
in some cases , however , families return the symbolic payment to signify that their daughter is not for sale			0
@entity93 , who has just completed a phd in social anthropology researching young women 's livelihoods in @entity70 , says the " bride price is an incredibly significant part of marriage customs in @entity70 " that " should be seen as a token of respect towards and provision for family and community , rather than a monetary value placed on an individual female			1
" she explains that in @entity114 , for example , " the bride price itself is negotiated after the first formal ' introduction , ' when the fiance is introduced to the girl 's parents			1
the girl 's family will then write a list of everything they require from the fiance 's family -- this is not just money but could also include rice , ( fresh ) palm wine or crates of beer and soft drinks			1
" the fiance 's family then look at the list and agree on what they can afford before going back to negotiate with the girl 's family			1
there is then a formal meeting of both families , where the girl identifies her fiance in front of her whole family , who check that everything on the list has been brought to them			0
only after this is all satisfactorily achieved can the traditional marriage go ahead			0
" @entity144 adds , however , that the bride price practices vary considerably between ethnic groups , and even within them due to families ' wealth and status			0
" it is custom for fathers in @entity153 ( northern @entity154 ) to give back the money to his new son - in - law during the traditional marriage ceremony , saying , ' my daughter can not be bought but you can marry her			0
' " @entity163 , who owns @entity63 , has made it clear that the app is supposed to be a bit a fun			2
his own wife , he says , was one of the first users of the app which was developed by a mostly female team : " did i pay a bride price ? " he asks			1
" yes ! @entity70 is a big , complex country , with over 200 tribes , but where i come from , the entire process of marriage is designed to show respect to the wife 's family , " adds @entity163			2
" as insignificant as the bride price is -- @entity181 ( $ 0.18 ) in my case -- it must be collected			0
i value this tradition , and think it 's a part of our culture we must preserve			2
" i went overboard with buying gifts for my wife 's family , because i was very young then , and i wanted to show i really respected them			2
it may be hard for our foreign audience to understand , but i do n't see why the scores on any app , joke or not , should affect the love i have for my wife , or her self - worth			1
" the app has had mixed reactions both in @entity70 and across the world with some seeing the funny side , such as @entity72 - @entity70 journalist @entity202 , who wrote a tongue - in - cheek commentary on it for the @entity205			2
others were outraged , including @entity208 's @entity207 who labeled it a " horrifying , sexist quiz " and @entity210 who has started a petition to remove the app which reached 100 signatures on may 28			1
while many users shared their bride price on @entity216			2
although there were some concerns about the criteria			0
@entity163 told @entity4 the reasoning behind this : " that 's a @entity70 inside joke			2
on the average @entity70 street , there 's a joke that ' too much book dey worry person ' ( a tongue - in - cheek reference to too much education )			2
but this does n't mean phds are devalued			0
" over the weekend , we hosted a party for my former boss , who just bagged a phd			0
@entity70 are some of the most educated people in the world			0
but us @entity70 , we do n't take ourselves too seriously			0
