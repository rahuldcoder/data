when i first poked my head inside @entity3 's newest spaceship , i felt a little like i was getting a front - row seat to space history			1
the company , led by billionaire @entity8 , allowed @entity10 unprecedented access to a " @entity16 , @entity17 " spacecraft which was being carefully assembled by workers at a secure facility in the high desert north of @entity15			1
this invention spun from carbon fiber and imagination is designed to fly tourists some 60 miles high to the edge of space			1
in 2008 , @entity8 predicted the company would be launching paying passengers by 2010			1
obviously that has n't happened yet			2
meanwhile , more than 700 people -- reportedly including astrophysicist @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 -- are awaiting to gain official status as @entity31			1
the latest word : @entity3 says it 's on track to begin commercial service by the end of this year			1
" @entity36 was n't built in a day , " @entity8 tweeted in january			2
the spaceship i boarded is n't expected to fly until 2015			2
i was asked not to take photos or video			2
from the inside , it looks bigger than you 'd expect after seeing its 60 - foot - long exterior			2
for some reason i expected more machinery during assembly			2
standing inside the cabin 's shell , i found four technicians working away with precision and @entity53			0
there were no furnishings installed yet , so i tried to imagine which of the six seats in the spacecraft would be my choice -- if i could afford a $ 250,000 ticket			0
the cabin is dotted with so many windows it blew me away -- a side window and a ceiling window for every passenger			1
i imagined myself in the front row			0
stepping carefully to the window , i remembered what space travelers have said about the power of seeing the awe - inspiring curvature of the @entity73 and what a life - changing experience that is			2
i was sort of projecting that as i stood inside the spaceship			0
here 's how @entity3 's space tours are supposed to work : six passengers and two pilots will board a @entity16 -- a combination rocket and glider			1
the ship is attached to a powerful airplane , called a @entity83			0
that plane flies the rocket / gilder up to about 50,000 feet			0
then the real fun starts			0
the pilots separate the spacecraft from the plane			0
they ignite the spacecraft 's rocket engine , creating g - forces that pin passengers back in their seats , according to @entity3			1
they 'll experience " eye - watering acceleration " to nearly 2,500 mph , more than three times the speed of sound			0
as the ship reaches higher and higher , the cobalt blue sky turns to black			0
passengers will be allowed out of their seats -- to feel that weightlessness we 've all heard so much about			2
it will be interesting to learn what really happens during the six minutes of weightlessness that @entity3 says passengers will get on each flight			1
imagine all six passengers inside this cabin as they 're dying to get that space - faring - selfie they can post online for the rest of their lives			1
i 'm wondering : what are the rules in space to get those photos ? how is that going to work ? is everyone going to be bumping into each other while they 're floating around the cabin ? there were four workers in the ship 's cabin with me , and i could imagine us all bumping into each other -- accidentally throwing an elbow while we tried to maintain balance and control in zero - @entity133 after the weightless portion of the flight -- if all goes according to plan -- passengers will strap themselves back into their seats before the spacecraft yields to the forces of gravity and begins its glide downward toward sweet @entity73			1
related : what does a @entity3 ticket get you ? perhaps the real , lasting value of this experience will be what passengers bring back with them			1
will it change the way they live here on @entity73 ? @entity3 says its primary goal is n't about pushing the boundaries of space exploration			1
it 's about offering people a chance to gain a new perspective on the world -- literally and figuratively			2
will seeing the beauty of the planet shift the way passengers interact with the environment ? will it trigger people to embrace more environmentally sustainable lifestyles and technologies ? whatever the case , the @entity3 website promises : " life will never quite be the same again			1
" as anticipation builds towards the maiden passenger flight , here are seven things about the program you may not know : 1			2
can we call them astronauts ? @entity3 refers to its space tourists as " passenger astronauts			1
" but @entity184 does n't like it			0
" i do n't think they should be called astronauts , " @entity184 told @entity10 in 2010			0
" that term was created by the @entity189 military			0
my suggestions would be star - traveler or starflyer			0
" @entity184 knows from astronauts			0
let 's not forget he was the the second astronaut to walk on the moon			0
@entity196 nationals are banned from flights @entity189 anti-espionage laws require @entity3 to ban @entity196 nationals from its flights , according to the @entity200			1
why ? because rocket engines on the @entity3 vessels reportedly are considered military - grade technology under @entity189 arms trafficking laws established during the @entity205			1
the legislation was designed to prevent certain foreign powers , such as @entity196 , from getting hold of @entity189 military tech secrets			0
@entity3 accepts @entity210 for the unaware : @entity210 is an experimental form of money that exists only online			1
it 's not regulated by any central authorty			0
about 12 million @entity210 have entered circulation			0
@entity8 told @entity216 last january that a " future astronaut , a female flight attendant from @entity218 , has already purchased her @entity3 ticket using @entity210			1
look who 's hitching a ride : @entity222 as everyone knows , @entity222 figured out how to go to the moon long ago			0
now , after the death of the shuttle program , the legendary space agency is relying on others for transportation			2
@entity3 has agreed to carry a dozen @entity222 technology experiments on its first commercial research flight			1
should @entity3 partner with @entity233 ? @entity234 , managing editor of the space news site @entity236 , speculates that @entity3 and @entity233 might make a good match to help @entity233 gain a foothold in space			1
@entity233 already is developing flying wind - turbine technology			0
@entity242 's secret seat - mate at a charity auction last year in @entity245 , an anonymous bidder won a @entity3 seat next to actor @entity242 , according to the @entity247			1
winning bid : $ 1.5 million			0
breakfast in @entity249 , lunch in @entity15 @entity8 is said to be looking down the road to even more space ventures , including high - speed , point - to - point travel on @entity73			2
imagine traveling by rocket - plane from @entity249 to @entity256 in an hour -- or from @entity249 to @entity15 in a couple of hours			0
with every delay , the global attention on @entity3 intensifies to prove that it will accomplish what it set out to do years ago			1
i ca n't wait to see what happens next			0
we 'll keep you posted .			0
