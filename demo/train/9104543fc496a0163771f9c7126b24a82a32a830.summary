editor 's note : @entity2 won the gold medal in figure skating at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , and is a graduate of @entity9			1
medalist @entity2 says the @entity10 are about excellence and unity			1
( @entity13 ) -- what are the first thoughts that pop into your mind when you hear the word @entity19 ? probably something synonymous with excellence , greatness , excitement , achievement			1
maybe it 's the striking image of @entity26 scoring a perfect 10 etched in your mind , or the experience of following @entity30 ' quest to win a record - breaking eight gold medals last summer in @entity32 , @entity33			0
or is it the thrill of watching the 1980 @entity37 @entity19 hockey team winning the gold medal in @entity39 , stacked up against unimaginable odds , that occupies that space ? i could go on and on , but whatever image the @entity19 has for you is probably accompanied by a feeling of pride , happiness , joyfulness , maybe even a childlike glee			1
sometimes it 's the simple way you can sum up your response to the question -- and perhaps that 's the point of asking the question -- but it would be foolish to ignore other aspects of the @entity10 that contribute to making the event happen			0
although the presence of public officials at host - city bids shows the @entity60 that they are behind the bid and will be supportive , such appearances are not required			0
on friday , president @entity62 , a @entity64 , @entity63 , resident for many years , will arrive in @entity65 , @entity66 ( his wife is already there ) , to support and try to persuade the @entity60 voters in favor of the 2016 @entity64 bid			1
@entity62 's visit to @entity65 will make him the first @entity37 president to attend an @entity19 host - city vote			1
his visit will not be the first by a president ( or prime minister ) whose country went on to win a bid for the @entity10			0
@entity81 prime minister @entity80 and his wife were in @entity83 lobbying @entity60 members for the @entity86 host - city vote when @entity87 was awarded the event			0
two years later , @entity90 president @entity89 went to the host - city vote in @entity92 when @entity93 , a relatively unknown city , won the right to host the @entity95			0
the other 2016 contenders vying for votes from the 100 - plus eligible members of the @entity60 are @entity99 , @entity100 ; @entity101 , @entity102 ; and @entity103 , @entity104			0
@entity105 , a lifelong @entity64 enthusiastically championing the @entity37 bid , is displaying her " olympic spirit			1
" on monday , the eve of her visit to @entity65 , she spoke of being ready to woo each voter individually if need be : " gloves are off			0
i 'm talking to everybody			0
that 's what my schedule looks like			0
" sounding like an @entity19 competitor already herself , she added that she did n't " think there 's one person left off			1
" it is easy to come to the conclusion that i might be biased , having won a gold medal in figure skating at the 2002 @entity10 , but i was an @entity37 and a fan long before those games , and i will be one long after			1
the memories , unity and patriotism from the @entity126 was n't about any one particular thing but about all those little " things " coming together : the result of what the participants -- the fans , volunteers , competitors , coaches , moms , dads , sisters , brothers , cities and nations -- created by sharing the best we have to offer with one another			2
that 's what the @entity19 are about			2
they are about greatness , they are about excellence , but above all , the @entity10 are about unity			2
in a september 10 letter to @entity60 members , @entity62 wrote about how he " sees the 2016 @entity19 and @entity155 as an extraordinary opportunity for @entity37 to renew our bonds of friendship and welcome the world to our shores with open arms			1
" and on friday , when @entity62 arrives in @entity65 , he will be joined by @entity102 president @entity163 , newly appointed @entity104 prime minister @entity164 and @entity165			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity62 is among other world *leaders* who have sought @entity19
she says games are about excellence and unity in support of @entity37 teams
she says @entity105 is showing she shares the @entity19 spirit
