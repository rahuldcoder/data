-- @entity2 , people are in the early hours of trying to keep their @entity4 's resolutions : lose that 15 pounds , find that job that will make you happy , move to that city where you 've always dreamed of living			1
there is one kind of resolution , though , that very few of us will ever be in a position to make			1
somewhere today , someone at the very pinnacle of his or her career is thinking of doing in 2012 what @entity18 did in 2011 : get out on top			1
willingly walk away and declare victory			2
leave the table while the dice are still hot			2
@entity18 was the manager of the @entity24 who , within days of guiding his team to victory in the @entity28 , announced that he was done			1
it has never happened before in baseball , according to historians of the sport			2
no manager before @entity18 ever retired in the same calendar year his team won the @entity28			1
human nature tells us to hang on while success is at its peak			2
you do n't see many @entity41 who have just led their corporations to record profits say : i have nothing left to prove			2
i 'm through -- it 's been fun			1
who does that , when further riches and accolades await ? the inner knowledge that things may never be this good again competes against the thought that cruising speed can be exceedingly comfortable once you 've made it to the apex			2
who reaches the top of the mountain and then , with the cheers still ringing , decides : no more mountaintops for me ? it happens in sports , once in a great while			1
@entity67 retired from boxing in 1956 as undefeated heavyweight champion of the world			1
@entity71 walked away from professional football after the 1965 season while still the best running back in the sport			1
they had won the game , literally			2
they left the field and never looked back			1
how difficult is that -- not to look back ? there are two schools of thought , each completely understandable			1
in 1970 the @entity84 , having accomplished everything , officially disbanded and never again shared a public stage			1
less than a decade after they said goodbye to their fans , i had dinner with @entity92 , and asked him about it			2
he was adamant that the band -- all four were still alive at the time -- had made the right decision , and would stick to it			2
i told him i 'd read that a promoter had offered $ 45 million for the @entity84 to sing together one more time			1
" i think it was 50 million , " @entity92 said			0
" but the thing is , we do n't want to do it			0
we do n't want to get together			0
and if we did want to get together , we could do it ourselves ; we would n't need anybody from the outside offering us any money			0
i think these promoters keep coming up with these big money offers just to get their names in the paper			0
it makes them little heroes for a day			0
" i told him that there were many people who never got to see the @entity84 perform , and yearned for the chance			1
" a lot of people say , ' i never saw them , and i want to see them just once , ' " he said			0
" well , i never saw the @entity84 , either			1
i really wish i could have , but unfortunately i was onstage			0
i would have loved to have been out in the audience and have seen the @entity84			1
i would have liked to see what all the excitement was about			0
" but , he said , it was over			0
for the fans -- and for the musicians -- the memories would have to be enough			0
@entity85 was a different story			1
his resolve to stay away for good was short - lived			0
he missed terribly that which he had loved			1
during his first retirement from basketball , the @entity133 ' management put up a statue of @entity137 outside the @entity138 in @entity139			0
one night i asked him about it			0
" do i look like a statue to you ? " he said			0
" i 'm not a statue			0
the whole thing makes me feel very strange			0
a statue just stands still forever while people stare at it			0
" i asked if he ever planned to drive by the arena and look at the statue			0
" no , " he said			0
" it 's not something i have whole lot of interest in doing -- driving out to see myself in front of a building			2
what am i going to do ? get out of my car and toss coins at myself for luck ? " it 's a piece of metal			2
it 's stuck in one place			2
" it was n't overly surprising when @entity85 returned to the @entity166 , and then , after a second retirement , when he did it again			1
a few months ago , in @entity169 , i unexpectedly ran into him on the sidewalk			0
as we stood speaking on @entity172 near 50th street , people catching sight of him did stop and stare almost as if they were looking at a statue			0
in 2009 , in a speech at the @entity178 , @entity85 said that he might play again when he was 50			1
when the audience reacted as if it was a joke , @entity85 said : " oh , do n't laugh			1
" next month , he turns 49			0
the @entity84 stuck to their vow , and now , with @entity182 and @entity183 long dead , the vow is destined to last forever			1
@entity137 ? it does n't seem likely that he 'll un-retire one more time , however briefly , to prove something to himself , but stranger things have happened			0
happy new year to the rest of us			0
we 'll never have a choice like that			0
but somewhere in the @entity197 today , someone at the very top of his or her field is almost certainly thinking about it			1
when you 've loved doing something for your whole life , can you wave goodbye to it before you have to ? ask @entity18 a year from now			1
it can be harder than it looks			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : at @entity4 , consider those , like @entity24 ' @entity18 , who quit while ahead
he asks : how many of us could make a resolution like that ? how many could not look back ?
he says @entity84 , @entity67 did . @entity85 tried , but came back to what he loved
@entity207 : somewhere someone at top of field is *mulling* quitting in 2012 . it 's harder than it looks
