-- in the midst of intense national gun debate , lawmakers in @entity2 proposed a tougher gun law -- but only for the city of @entity7			1
new legislation calls for a two - year minimum sentence for any illegal firearm possession in the city , bumping the current misdemeanor charge up to a felony			1
state sen. @entity14 of @entity7 , a @entity15 , and rep. @entity16 of @entity7 , a @entity17 , joined with local officials to announce the proposal in hopes of decreasing violence in the city			1
in a news release issued thursday , the day the legislation was introduced , @entity14 said that " it gives @entity7 's law enforcement community an important new tool that will help curb gun violence and keep illegal weapons out of the hands of criminals			1
" @entity7 district attorney @entity32 added that the change would " make the message loud and clear -- if you carry an illegal gun in @entity7 , you will go to prison			2
" other state officials are positive about the proposal , even though it would apply only to @entity7			2
" in urban areas , it 's a much more chronic issue			1
i think we have to do something about the gun situation there , " sen. @entity43 said friday			0
@entity43 , a @entity17 representing parts of @entity50 and @entity51 counties , just outside the city , is a part of the @entity55 committee that will review the legislation			2
he said his only concern is the wording making the sentence mandatory , which he said might imprison people who do n't belong in jail , such as those whose gun permits might have expired without their knowledge			0
a study by the @entity66 last year called @entity7 the nation 's most violent city in the nation , with a homicide rate well above other municipalities			1
the proposal was made on the same day that neighboring @entity73 and @entity74 passed sweeping gun legislation			0
@entity73 's new law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high - capacity magazines such as those used in the @entity83 shooting in december that left 20 children and six adults dead in a school			2
it also requires background checks for all gun purchases			0
in @entity74 , the legislation includes a ban on assault - style weapons and sets a 10 - round limit for gun magazines			0
it also will require training for many first - time gun owners and bans some individuals with mental health issues from gun ownership			0
the proposed legislation will be reviewed by committees in the @entity55 and @entity104 .			0
