on sunday the @entity1 's @entity0 and the @entity2 will face off in the @entity4			1
for the @entity0 , winning would give them the chance to go back to the @entity8 and perhaps net another @entity9			0
high stakes to be sure , but officials in one @entity13 suburb have taken pre-game rivalry to the next level by banning " possession of and / or consumption of cheese or cheese flavored products			1
" for those not making the connection between cheese and this @entity1 matchup , @entity25 , the city manager of @entity26 , @entity27 , spells it out in his executive order			1
" on sunday , january 18 , 2015 , the @entity0 opponent in the nfc championship game will be the @entity2 , aka @entity34 , " the order states			1
" fans of the @entity2 are frequently seen wearing obnoxious wedge - shaped foam hats painted yellow			0
" it is " due to this relationship " between @entity2 fans and cheese that the ban was enacted			2
the ban only applies to employees at city hall and only on friday , but @entity25 has a plan for anyone who defies the ban and comes , pun intended , packing			0
" i 'm going to arrive early , and we 'll have some type of cheese grater or shredder available so if anybody brings in cheeses or cheese products , we 'll have to dispose of them , " @entity25 told @entity3 affiliate @entity49			2
the ban may only impact a fraction of the town 's 23,000 residents , but it caught the attention of @entity2 fans almost 2,000 miles away			0
" @entity68 , " " ridiculous " and " demonic " were just a few of the adjectives thrown out by distraught @entity34 to @entity3 affiliate @entity67			0
" they should never ban cheese , " said one man " we are going to own @entity13			1
" some proposed bans of their own , such as a boycott of @entity13 - based @entity75			1
but one @entity77 radio station did one better			1
94.5 the @entity78 will " say no to @entity13			2
" that means no songs from @entity81 , @entity82 or @entity83 before the big game			1
the preparations are n't all about bans either			0
in the @entity26 executive order , @entity25 also calls for a " @entity93 " celebration for all local government employees , who are encouraged to wear " @entity0 jerseys , logo gear , team colors			2
" but lest anyone get carried away , @entity25 made it clear , in an interview with @entity49 , to leave the @entity97 and cheez - whiz at home			0
and do n't even think about sneaking in some on a party tray			0
but cheese lovers needing a fix may have one remaining option : @entity25 said " he has yet to scour the vending machines			0

cheese is banned in @entity26 , @entity27 , before sunday 's @entity4
@entity110 radio station wo n't play songs from @entity13 artists before the big game
