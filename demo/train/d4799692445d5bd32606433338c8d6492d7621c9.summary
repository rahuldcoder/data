@entity0 -- imagine a skyscraper that cleans the air			1
you wo n't have to wait long -- two will soon be built in @entity6			1
the world 's tallest towers , futuristic pink spires that " breath life " into the environment , are due to begin construction within two years			1
the ambitious @entity14 towers were designed by @entity0 - based architects @entity15 and will claim the tallest building title from @entity18 's @entity17			1
and the design goes one step further : the towers will be one of the world 's most environmentally - friendly buildings			1
stretching up more than a kilometer into the skies above @entity27 , the capital of @entity6 's @entity29 province , the @entity14 project aims to clean the air and water from its surrounding areas			1
it 's expected to become a tourist attraction for both @entity6 and international travelers			1
@entity37 chairman @entity36 told @entity1 the project is more than just an architectural statement			1
it 's also about preserving the lakes of the region , he said			2
" you can imagine the pressure those lakes are under , [ with ] a huge dense city growing around them , " he said			0
" so we thought we could not only attract attention with the towers but also breathe life , literally , into the lakes			2
" the architects have looked to the natural world for inspiration , building a " thermal chimney " in the center of the taller tower			1
the chimney , heated by the sun , will draw air from across the lakes and use it to cool the buildings			0
the air will then be filtered and churned back into the environment cleaner than before			0
the buildings will do the same with the water , tantamount to " putting air back into the water like in a typical fish tank ...			0
but we 're also cleansing the water and putting it back , " @entity36 said			0
the towers have also drawn on @entity6 culture , reflecting its use of the phoenix as a metaphor			2
" it 's two dragons or two birds -- one male , one female -- and we use this idea as a symbiotic idea , one feeding off the other for the benefit of all			0
" the taller of the two towers will accommodate a kaleidoscope , turned by a wind turbine , and creating what @entity36 hopes will be a " wonderful experience when you look up			0
" combined with photovoltaic panels , they produce electricity for the project -- with some spare for the district			0
the smaller tower will feature the world 's tallest " green wall , " or vertical garden , which will climb to the top of the tower			1
but perhaps the most controversial architectural feature are the huge celestial orbs strung between the two towers , housing restaurants and viewing platforms			2
the designs are unusual , the " sort of idea that @entity6 embraces , that perhaps somewhere else in the world they think you 're going too far there , " @entity36 said			2
the towers will glow in vibrant pink , as a nod to the fuchsia flower			0
while architects often pivot to monochromatic colors , @entity36 wanted to mix it up with color			2
also , he adds , " i hold my hands up and say i actually like the color and thought it would look stunning			0
" constructions starts in 2016 , and the aim , @entity36 said , is for people to " have their breath taken away			0

the world 's next tallest building is being built in @entity6 , and the two towers will clean the air around them
the @entity14 project has been designed by @entity0 - based architects @entity142 , building will begin 2016
