@entity0 , @entity1 -- if an elementary school teacher graded you on your involvement in your child 's education , what kind of a grade would you get ? should your kid 's first - grade teacher be grading you in the first place ? if @entity1 state rep. @entity15 's bill becomes law , public school teachers will be required to grade the parents of students in kindergarten through the third grade			1
the parents ' grades of " satisfactory , " " unsatisfactory " or " needs improvement " would be added to their children 's report card			2
@entity15 , a @entity26 who sits on several education legislative committees , says that parental involvement is key to educating children for years to come			1
as the mother of five , @entity15 says , she understands the importance of her role in educating her children			1
" i think a lot of parents understand that is something that is critical , " she said			2
" on the other hand , you have some parents that do n't realize they are not providing the needs			2
" @entity1 lawmakers have spent years overhauling the public school system to make schools and their teachers accountable for student achievements			2
many parents and teachers have not welcomed the changes			1
in the late 1990s , the state began the @entity53 , or @entity53 , in which a school would be graded based on the overall score of its students			1
from the beginning , proponents of the @entity53 wanted schools held accountable for their students ' grades through standardized testing			0
critics contend that teachers are forced to spend too much time preparing students for the test instead of actually teaching			1
teachers , do you want to grade parents ? share your thoughts in the @entity73			1
last year , gov. @entity74 vetoed a bill that tied a teacher 's pay to his or her students ' achievement			2
another version of the bill is expected to pass this year under new gov. @entity81			2
" we have student accountability , we have teacher accountability , and we have administration accountability , " @entity15 said			1
" this was the missing link , which was , look at the parent and making sure the parents are held accountable			1
" @entity89 , an academic intervention facilitator for @entity91 , called the proposal a " unique notion			0
" " the thought has never entered my mind to grade a parent , " she said			2
teachers agree that parental involvement is crucial to a child 's education			2
but some teachers say that grading the parents is not the answer			1
@entity104 , who teaches first grade in the small central @entity1 city of @entity107 , is not sure that grading parents will work			1
" i think those parents that are not going to show up or not do anything , " said @entity109 , who teaches students from primarily poor homes , " it 's not going to faze them , whether you put ' unsatisfactory			2
' " the grading system is based on three criteria that @entity15 wrote in the legislation : a child should be at school on time , prepared to learn after a good night 's sleep , and have eaten a meal			1
a child should have the homework done and prepared for examinations			0
there should be regular communication between the parent and teacher			0
" those three things are key to a quality education , " @entity15 said			1
@entity135 , a @entity2 education contributor and founder of @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity140 , says he could n't disagree more			0
@entity135 insists that a good education is based on what a child learns in the classroom and not what a parent might know that could help their child			0
" there is nothing in any teacher 's training that would put them in a position to be able to effectively judge the parenting of one their student 's parents , " @entity135 argued			0
" if getting a bad grade was the impetus for people doing things right , then i would have an entire school of kids getting @entity165			1
" kindergarten teacher @entity166 of @entity167 in @entity107 disagrees			0
" this is the real world			0
you do n't always get a superior rating if you 're not doing a superior job			0
that 's life , " she said			0
" we grade our children based on their performance			0
why should the parents be any different ? " some parents said they laughed out loud after hearing about the proposed legislation			1
on the sidelines of his son 's soccer practice in @entity186 , @entity182 said he thought it was an interesting proposal			0
" it could have some validity			0
we could try it and see how that might work out for everyone , " he said			0
@entity195 , who has two daughters -- one in high school and the other a mother of three young children -- welcomed the idea of being graded on her parental skills			0
" i would n't mind that at all			0
i would get a good grade , " she said			0
" if you 're more involved with your children when they 're littler , when they grow older , they 're more stable , more willing to sit down and do the work			0
" @entity15 acknowledges that not everyone agrees with her legislation , which she said is still under revision			1
the bill was not intended to tell parents how to raise their kids , she says			1
" we want to make sure parents are involved in the education of their children , " @entity15 said			1
@entity219 agrees that parents like him appreciate feedback from their children 's teachers , but he says requiring teachers to grade parents is not the answer			1
" bottom line : everyone wants the best for their kids , " he said .			0
