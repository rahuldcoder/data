@entity0 -- plans to build a mosque two blocks away from ground zero have set off an emotional debate among area residents and relatives of victims of the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks			1
@entity12 project calls for a 15 - story community center including a mosque , performance art center , gym , swimming pool and other public spaces			1
the project is a collaboration between the @entity21 and the @entity22 , both of which work to improve relations with followers of the religion			1
the two groups presented their vision to part of the @entity31 of lower @entity32 on wednesday night			1
@entity33 , a board member who attended the meeting , said the project did not need to get the board 's approval			1
" they own the land , and their plans do n't have any zoning changes , " @entity33 said			2
" they came to us for our opinions and to let us know their plans			0
it was purely voluntary on their part			0
" the 12 members who were at the meeting voted unanimously to support the project			1
community board members are appointed by the borough president and serve as advisers to the borough president and the mayor 's office			1
@entity58 , executive director of the @entity60 society , described her vision of a center led by @entity60 , but serving the community as a whole			1
" it will have a real community feel , to celebrate the pluralism in the @entity69 , as well as in the @entity71 religion , " @entity65 said			1
" it will also serve as a major platform for amplifying the silent voice of the majority of @entity60 who have nothing to do with extremist ideologies			0
it will counter the extremist momentum			0
" the need for the center is twofold , @entity65 said , because it will support the needs of the growing @entity60 community			1
" the time for a center like this has come because @entity71 is an @entity69 religion , " @entity65 said			1
" we need to take the 9/11 tragedy and turn it into something very positive			2
" @entity33 said a community center for lower @entity32 residents is " desperately needed			1
" the area was mostly commercial , @entity33 said , but as more people move downtown , the lack of residential amenities is a problem			0
the project got mixed reviews from families and friends of september 11 victims			1
" i think it 's the right thing to do , " said @entity104 , who was a paramedic at ground zero			0
" i lost 16 friends down there			2
but @entity60 also got killed on 9/11			2
it would be a good sign of faith that we 're not condemning all @entity60 and that the @entity60 who did this happened to be extremists			0
as a black man , i know what it 's like to be discriminated against when you have n't done anything			0
" @entity120 , whose son was killed in the attacks , supports the project as a way to bridge cultural divide			2
" i understand the anger , the bitterness and hatred , but it only generates more hatred , " @entity120 said			0
" such a large part of the world has this faith , and to say anyone who has this faith is a terrorist , it 's terrible			0
" others decried the idea of building a mosque so close to where their relatives died			2
" @entity32 should be made into a shrine for the people who died there , " said @entity140 , a retired city detective who worked at ground zero			1
" it breaks my heart for the families who have to put up with this			2
i understand they 're [ building ] it in a respectful way , but it just should n't be down there			0
" others such as @entity154 said the site 's location will be a painful reminder			0
" [ the 9/11 terrorists ] did this in the name of @entity71 , " @entity154 said			2
" it 's a sacred ground where these people died , where my brother was murdered , and to be in the shadows of that religion , it 's just hypocritical and sacrilegious			0
" however , @entity65 emphasized that the attacks killed @entity60 , too			0
" three hundred of the victims were @entity60 , that 's 10 percent of the victims , " she said			2
" we are @entity69 too			0
the 9/11 tragedy hurt everybody including the @entity60 community			1
we are all in this together and together we have to fight against extremism and terrorism			0
" @entity12 is still in its early stages of development			0
the @entity181 is hoping to raise funds for the center to be completed in three to five years .			1
