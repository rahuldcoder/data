@entity0 , @entity1 -- one of @entity1 leader @entity4 's sons -- @entity7 -- was killed after a @entity9 airstrike , a spokesman for @entity1 's government said sunday at a press conference			1
@entity4 and his wife were in their son 's house when it was targeted , spokesman @entity11 said			1
both of them are in good health , according to the spokesman			1
the victim is one of two @entity4 sons whose names begin with @entity7			2
the other is @entity25 , who had previously touted reform but has emerged as one of his father 's most visible defenders in recent months			0
@entity11 said several of @entity4 's grandchildren also died in the attack			2
the house in @entity0 was destroyed by the strike , with a massive crater where the house used to be			2
at least one unexploded bomb could be seen			0
the building was in a residential area of @entity0 , according to @entity11 , who insisted that @entity7 was a student in @entity39 who was not deeply involved in @entity1 's military and government			2
the 29 - year - old was the sixth of @entity4 's eight biological children			1
@entity11 railed against @entity9 after the fatal strike , calling it an illegal act and a " war crime			1
speaking at a rally , @entity11 told fellow @entity1 , " every one of you are @entity7			2
" lt. gen. @entity53 , commander of @entity9 's military operations , said in a statement he was " aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of @entity4 's family members may have been killed			1
" we regret all loss of life , especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict , " @entity59 said			0
" @entity9 is fulfilling its @entity67 mandate to stop and prevent attacks against civilians with precision and care -- unlike @entity4 's forces , which are causing so much suffering			1
" the @entity9 commander stated that all targets " are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the @entity4 regime 's systemic attacks on the @entity1 population ... we do not target individuals			1
" a senior official in president @entity83 's administration said the @entity85 government is " very aware " of the reports , but can not confirm who , if anyone , died in a strike until they see the evidence			0
gunfire broke out around @entity0 after the news came out , while a large crowd of demonstrators gathered around @entity4 's compound			0
images on @entity97 showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags			0
protesters could be heard yelling , " we want to redeem the martyr , " as well as , " oh youth , this is time for jihad			0
" members of @entity4 's inner circle have been calling members of @entity83 's administration , saying " someone important " in the regime had been killed , a senior @entity85 administration official told @entity2			2
but they did not specify who had died , only to stress that it was n't @entity4 himself			0
a spokesman for the @entity1 opposition doubted the veracity of the report of the son 's death , saying , " in all honesty , we never heard of @entity7 until the start of the uprising			1
" " we do n't believe this is true , " said @entity125 , deputy chairman of the @entity126 in @entity127			0
" it is all fabrications by the regime in a desparate attempt to get sympathy ... this regime constantly lies and keeps lying			0
" @entity11 , the spokesman for @entity4 's government , accused @entity9 of launching the strike specifically in order to kill the @entity1 leader			1
earlier this week , @entity85 ambassador to @entity1 @entity141 acknowledged that " our own laws " would affect any decision to try to assassinate @entity4 directly			1
" i do n't believe that any credible group or individual sees the solution to the @entity1 problem without the removal of @entity4 , one way or the other , " he said			1
" but our job and our goal is to get a political solution , but through the means that we are allowed to by our own laws			0
" this is not the first time that @entity4 reportedly has been at the site of an airstrike that killed one of his children			1
in april 1986 , @entity85 forces launched an airstrike that targeted @entity4 's residential compound			0
as a result , the @entity1 leader 's adopted daughter , @entity163 , was killed			2
@entity7 , then just 3 years old , was hospitalized after suffering injuries in that strike , @entity1 officials then said			2
video shows what @entity1 officials claimed were him and his brother @entity171 , though both boys were heavily bandaged and their faces were not clearly visible			0
at the time , president @entity174 told the @entity85 people the bombings were an act of self - defense following the bombing of a @entity181 club that killed two @entity85 servicemen and injured several others			0
and on monday , @entity11 issued a defiant statement saying @entity4 was alive despite what the @entity1 government called a @entity9 attempt to kill him by bombing his compound			1
" the message that was sent by @entity9 in the early hours of this morning was sent to the wrong address , " @entity11 said			0
@entity192 , a former adviser to three @entity85 presidents and now a senior fellow at the @entity195 think tank , said the reported killing could complicate any chances that @entity4 might leave @entity1 peaceably after a negotiated solution			1
" a political solution was always a long shot , " @entity199 told @entity2 by e-mail			0
" but in @entity1 's very tribal politics , the death of a son makes any political settlement all that much harder			1
" @entity2 's @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity9 commander says that " we do not target individuals "
a rebel spokesman doubts the claim of the death of the son
a @entity1 spokesman calls the strike , which also killed several children , a " war crime "
