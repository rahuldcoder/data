-- " @entity1 " is heading into its season four finale with some pretty large expectations			1
show runners @entity4 and @entity6 have already promised that sunday 's season closer will be the series ' best yet , and @entity9 -- aka @entity10 -- is making that same bet			1
" i think this could be one of the best episodes of ' thrones ' we 've done , " @entity9 said at a june 11 screening of his new movie , " @entity18			0
" " usually the big impact episode is ( the ninth ) , and then we wrap everything up in the 10th			1
but this show does n't like doing what people think is going to happen ; we like changing things up , and it 's a lot that happens in this episode			1
it 's going to throw a lot of people , it 's going to be very exciting			2
" on " @entity1 , " " exciting " can also be a stand - in for " bloody " and " heartbreaking , " and chances are @entity9 's tease will just make fans more nervous for season four 's final hour			2
eerily titled " @entity36 , " the 10th episode has a lot to wrap up			1
the penultimate episode , june 8 's action - packed " @entity46 , " was focused entirely on @entity41 up at the @entity42 , making room for several questions leading into the finale			1
to begin with , most fans want to know what will happen to @entity50 's @entity49 , who 's going into episode 10 staring down a death sentence			2
as one of the series ' most essential characters -- both for his centrality to the story and because of the welcome balance he brings -- it 's hard to imagine @entity49 meeting this unjust fate , but " men meeting unjust fates " could be another tagline for " @entity1			0
" there 's also the question of where @entity68 and the @entity69 will go from here , now that they 've learned the woman they 've been searching for this season is dead			2
( cue poor orphaned @entity68 's giggle - fit			0
) will they continue their strange mentor - mentee relationship , and if so , what 's their next destination ? meanwhile in @entity81 , @entity80 is now without her most - trusted adviser , @entity84 , but she still has those dragons -- so what 's the next step in her game plan ? the promo for the season finale hints that at least @entity91 will find what he 's been searching for on his ( seemingly endless ) vision quest , but reveals little else about what 's to come for the rest of the crew			1
( there is another hint that @entity68 and the @entity69 may have a face - off with some unwelcome visitors , which might not bode well for the hound and his neck wound			0
) as for @entity10 , he 's " focused on being a leader " when episode 10 picks up , @entity9 teased to @entity105			1
after losing his wildling love , @entity108 , in episode nine , @entity106 is " a much colder person after this			2
he loses a lot of whatever warmth he had , which , let 's face it , was n't a lot			0
there 's a lot of lessons he 's learned in this last episode about doing what you need to do to survive and surviving past losing your love is one of those things			1
at the beginning of episode 10 you see a very broken man			0
" and , contrary to popular belief , @entity10 does know something , the actor added			1
" he 's not naÃ ¯ ve			0
he knew there was the possibility of seeing her die or her seeing him die at the battle			0
you know that thing when you break up with someone and you 're walking around the town where you both live and you 're just really hoping to see them ? you know that you 're not supposed to see them , but there 's nothing you want more			0
" basically , @entity10 could n't quit @entity108 , kind of like how we ca n't quit " @entity1 " no matter how many heads explode			1
yet it does n't seem we have to worry about the " traitor bastard 's " head being on the chopping block			0
next up for @entity9 , the actor said , is " doing ' @entity152			0
" @entity0 's @entity153 contributed to this report .			0
