@entity0 -- @entity2 is a smooth salesman			1
when he was a candidate in 2002 , his pitch to the people of @entity5 was that he could fix all that ailed us			2
as the @entity5 's top salesman , he said , he would " bring great jobs here			1
" he claimed he would at last be the governor to reform state government			1
most of us now would warn , " buyer beware			0
" under @entity2 , the @entity5 economy sputtered to 47th in the nation in job creation -- and that was in relatively good economic times			1
real wages declined ( while rising across the nation )			0
instead of helping workers and small businesses adjust to changes in the global economy , @entity2 cut critical work force training programs and millions in economic development funds			1
instead of promoting @entity5 to attract jobs , he used the state as a punchline on the national @entity32 political circuit			2
when i came into office immediately after @entity2 , hardly anything had been fixed			2
he left behind a bureaucracy whose work force grew during his term , an unsustainable public pension system and a culture of poor accountability throughout state government			1
young people and jobs were leaving our state			0
our roads and bridges were crumbling , and his @entity32 predecessors ' poor oversight of the infamous @entity54 project in downtown @entity0 resulted in billions of dollars of cost overruns , substandard workmanship and debilitating debt that he made no effort to remedy			0
in the face of budget challenges , what did @entity2 do ? he raised nearly every fee and surcharge that did n't bear the title " tax " and cut funding for the schools			2
in a state where education is our calling card , @entity2 was responsible for the second largest per pupil cut in education funding in @entity74 during his second year in office			2
i respect @entity2 's business success			1
he has also always been a gentleman to me			0
but in his only turn as a ceo in government , he failed to deliver			2
his one profoundly important achievement in government -- enacting universal health care -- is something he shuns on the campaign trail , not because he is n't proud of it but because it does n't fit his current conservative sales pitch			1
so what happened ? how could it be that a man who set out to send the @entity5 economy soaring into the stratosphere instead ran it into the ground ? why did a fellow who promised to reform state government fix so little ? @entity2 sincerely believes that people are better off on their own : on their own to deal with their unemployment ; with under - resourced public schools and no way to pay for college ; with neglected infrastructure ; with a job market that needs skills they did n't have			1
he does not fundamentally believe that government should help people help themselves			0
and he has a record as governor of @entity5 to demonstrate how much damage his leadership does to people , their families and our future			1
since @entity2 left , we have made very different choices in @entity5			1
as a result , we are getting very different outcomes			0
we are growing twice as fast as the national economy and adding jobs now faster than most other states			0
manufacturing is making a comeback			0
we are first in the nation in student achievement , in health care coverage , in economic competitiveness , in energy efficiency and in veterans services			1
we have earned the highest bond rating in the state 's history			1
government is also smaller , and many of the programs @entity2 promised but failed to fix , we actually fixed			1
none of this is by accident			0
it is happening because , like president @entity141 and unlike @entity2 , we understand that government does have a role to play in helping people help themselves			2
we know that when government invests in the education of its people , its infrastructure and innovation , it creates the conditions for both businesses and families to grow and thrive			0
most important , we understand that there are faces behind budget line items and that wise governing means seeing and dealing with the human , community and environmental bottom lines alongside the business one			0
today , @entity2 is trying to sell the same choices to the @entity74 people that he sold to the people of @entity5 not so long ago			1
@entity5 bought it then and got slow or no job growth , stifled innovation , neglected public infrastructure , and crowded and under - resourced schools			0
those choices did n't work before , and they wo n't work now			0
like i said , buyers beware			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity5 governor : @entity2 failed to deliver as governor
he says state 's economy suffered , and @entity2 did n't reform state government
@entity176 : his major achievement , health care *law* , is one he now shuns *discussing*
he says @entity2 's record *reflects* a view that government is a problem , not a solution
