investigators believe a killer is among them , strolling the lush streets of this coastal @entity4 community , on the hunt for another victim			1
a police sketch circulates around town , along with a detailed description : a white male , 56 to 60 , last seen wearing a white shirt and aviator glasses			0
authorities say the suspect may be so tired of roaming peacocks in this high - end community on the @entity19 in @entity20 that he 's systematically killing them			1
but this time he may have slipped up			0
in july , a witness spotted the man pull up in a @entity24 and open fire on a peacock with a pellet gun			0
that brings the death toll to 50 in two years , and lt. @entity29 of the @entity30 @entity20 wants to know whether his latest suspect is behind them all or just a copycat			1
if someone in the neighborhood knows , they have n't talked			0
in fact , it 's not hard to find those who say the peacocks are anything but innocent victims , as they peck the paint off cars , squawk into the night and leave a mess wherever they go			1
and for that reason , suspects could be on any block			0
but the sketch released in the latest killing has broken the case open , says @entity29			1
he 's narrowed his list of suspects and has forensic evidence that would rival any homicide investigation			2
" we needed that type of technology to be able to identify exactly what the projectiles were , " he said			0
but it did n't come easy			0
@entity29 first took the dead bird to his usual lab for a necropsy , but it lacked the science needed to identify and preserve the pellet			1
that 's when he took the bird to the coroner -- the same one doing autopsies on murder victims , only this time their victim was a peacock			2
" the coroner was able to x-ray the bird , identify entry wounds and they were able to recover the projectiles , which we were able to impound for forensic evidence , " @entity29 said			1
meaning , the pellets are so well - preserved that they 'll be used in court once the peacock killer is caught			0
" now , looking back on it , it is pretty extraordinary to think we actually used human science in an animal case , " he said			1
upping his game was a must , @entity29 says , as bird after bird turned up dead			1
not all can be traced to human hands , but when they are , " it 's cruel			1
" " a lot of these birds are being shot and left to die for days and days , " @entity29 said			1
" we have found birds that have had projectiles in their bodies for weeks			2
" peacocks take over " @entity103 , " she calls out			2
" come here @entity103 ! " @entity104 calls all her peacocks @entity103			2
well , they 're not hers , but they 've taken a liking to her property and her kindness			0
in a tightly wound neighborhood where threats range from curious children - at - play to roaring trash trucks , @entity104 's property is a peacock sanctuary			2
" who would n't love them , " she says , now almost nose - to - nose with @entity103			0
" just look at them , they 're so beautiful			0
" @entity104 has lived here since 1983 , but even at that length , the peacocks predate her by more than half a century			2
local historians say the peacocks and other types of birds were brought here in 1913 by @entity130 banker @entity129 while he developed the region			1
he gave most of his birds away during the depression but kept the peacocks until his death in 1937			1
" but the 24 peacocks that lived loose around @entity129 's property had chicks , their chicks had chicks , and their families thrived , " wrote his granddaughter @entity136 for the introduction to " @entity138 , " one of several children 's books inspired by the peafowl			1
now , a century later , the peacocks are so rooted in the community they 're a fixture on signs and mailboxes and have inspired a golf tournament at the local country club			2
" i had a pine tree in the backyard and every night , 40 peacocks would gather in it			0
i used to have ' peeking at peacocks potlucks , ' " said @entity161 , a neighbor on @entity162 too embarrassed to share a last name			0
" this went on for 20 years , then i married a woman who did n't like the sound of them , so she made me cut down the tree			0
" peacock pranks wearing a badge and carrying a gun , @entity4 law gives @entity29 of the @entity30 full police power while investigating cruelty cases			1
it 's serious business to him , so when he released a composite sketch of the peacock killer , he thought the community would immediately turn him in			0
that was n't the case			0
" people would call in saying they thought it was @entity186 or @entity187 , " @entity29 says of the prank calls he received			1
" i did get a call where the message was peacocks squawking , so we had a joke in the office that the peacocks were trying to contact us and tell us who the suspect was			0
" finding the humor is temporary relief from a frustrating case that has dragged on for two years			1
@entity29 says he 's sure of two things : the suspect lives in the community and if he is n't found , another bird will turn up dead			1
" it 's no way for any living thing to die , to just deteriorate because of somebody 's violence			0
such is life on the streets for the peacocks of @entity19 -- not exactly the world depicted in the children 's book " @entity214			2
" then again , on page 9 , a mother peahen sadly warns her chicks : " the neighborhood is full of danger for peacocks			0

in the lush hills of a @entity4 *enclave* , peacocks have *proliferated* for decades
fifty of the birds have been killed over the past two years
lt. @entity29 of the @entity30 is on the case
he 's employing techniques usually used in human slayings to solve the *mystery*
