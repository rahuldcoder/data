-- ever since he was a young boy , @entity2 artist @entity1 has envisaged breathing new life into his surroundings			1
" when i woke up every morning , the first thing i 'd see was trash , " recalls @entity1 , whose childhood home faced a garbage heap where all of @entity8 's waste was dumped			1
" i used to say to my dad that when i grow up , i want to give trash a second chance			0
" and that 's exactly what he went on to do			0
a self - taught sculptor and painter , @entity16 is crafting visually striking artworks from abandoned refuse he collects from the streets of the @entity2 capital			1
the talented artist is best known for his " @entity23 , " a series of eye - catching handmade spectacles			1
in @entity1 's hands , cast - aside bolts , wires , spoons and bottle tops gain a new lease of life as vital components of whimsical pieces of art. stripped of their original value , the recycled materials are transformed into steampunk , one - of - a - kind creations that transcend traditional forms and challenge stereotypes			1
" i do n't see trash as waste , " says @entity1			1
" i just see the trash as a chance for creativity			0
" early struggles the resourceful artist 's fascination with glasses started at a very young age , inside the small two - bedroom house he shared with his parents and five siblings			0
he wanted to have a pair of his own spectacles , but his glasses - wearing father refused to give him his or get him any new ones			1
back in the 1960s , @entity1 's father was beaten by his mother after accidentally destroying a pair of expensive glasses she 'd bought him			1
that incident stayed with @entity1 's father , who told his young son that if he wanted to have eyewear , he should make it himself			1

soon after , he started crafting his own frames using cutlery , plastic and any other materials he could find in his house			0
uninterested in studying , @entity1 would stay up at nights to sculpt and paint ; at school , he 'd use his creations to barter with his classmates			1
" i never did exams , i never did homework , " explains @entity1			1
" i used to exchange : ' you 'll do my homework , i 'll give you my artwork , you 'll do my exam , i 'll give you my artwork , ' so that 's how i survived in school			0
" after finishing high school , @entity1 's father wanted him to study electronic engineering , like most members of his family			1
@entity1 , however , had no desire to study			2
his rebellious attitude , coupled with his refusal to adhere to any norms , did n't go down well with his family or community			0
" i grew up being a bad example , " says @entity1			2
" grownups used to tell their kids , ' you need to work hard or you 'll be end up like @entity1			1
' " international recognition without any support from his family , @entity1 took his artwork and moved from his house to embark on his artistic journey			2
he rented a studio where , apart from his arresting spectacles , he started working on colorful and satirical paintings , as well as sculptures -- all made of recycled materials collected while roaming the streets of @entity8			1
" i love nature , " says @entity1			2
" i walk every day , i ca n't survive without walking , " he adds			0
" i do n't know how to sit idle			0

earlier this year , @entity1 's father also visited his studio for the first time and was amazed by his son 's work			1
" [ it made me ] very proud , " says @entity1			2
" they are now understanding me , so i 'm very happy			0
" " selling poverty " it 's been an arduous journey for the soft - spoken artist , now in his 20s			0
" it 's hard to be an artist in @entity2 , " he admits			2
but @entity1 does n't want to dwell on the struggles of the past or the problems he 's currently facing			2
too many @entity2 and @entity163 artists , he says , are interested in " selling poverty instead of creativity			2
" " you get people saying , ' i grew up in the @entity169 slum , i grew up in this place and this place , buy my art , ' " says @entity1			2
" i want to change that -- not telling people about my problems , the poverty , " he adds			0
" i think it 's good to sell the creativity you have done , telling people you have this place [ so they can come ] to buy your work and see your ideas			0
" promoting art when he 's not crafting compelling artwork in his studio , or scouring the streets for materials , @entity1 is visiting rural communities in @entity2 as part of his " outreach " initiative , aimed at encouraging creativity and raising awareness about ecological issues in his country			1
in these areas , he holds workshops and teaches people how to create art with the materials surrounding them in an environmentally friendly way			0
he says he targets older generations because they are the ones who can have an impact in their communities			0
" if i teach grandmothers something about deforestation or taking care of nature , it 's easier for grandmothers to teach their children , " he says			0
and even though @entity1 's art is winning more and more admirers of all ages both home and abroad , there 's still one older person who needs convincing			2
" my grandmother is , up to now , keep looking for a good job for me , " says @entity1			0
" when you visit my grandmother , she asks you whether you work , " he adds			0
" if you say you 're working , she 'll ask you whether you can get an extra job for me			0
