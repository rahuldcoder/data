last fall , after i wrote an article about misogyny found on @entity4 , people began to send me links to content that they had tried and failed to have removed by the site			1
among these was a seven - minute video depicting a gang - rape of a girl by the side of the road and illustrations of an assault posted on @entity4 by a man whose victim feared for her life			1
i began looking more deeply into the subject and more people contacted me			0
i came across " humor " pages with names like " @entity22 , " and text and images of popular rape memes depicting about - to - be - raped , incapacitated girls			0
there were easily accessed pictures and videos of girls and women frightened , humiliated , bruised , beaten , raped , gang raped , bathed in blood , and , in a recently publicized case , beheaded			0
in one instance , @entity4 declined to remove an image of a woman , mouth covered in tape , in which the caption read , " do n't tap her and rap her			1
tape her and rape her			0
" the photo went viral			0
@entity4 's response to readers who reported it read , " we reviewed the photo you submitted , but found it did not violate our community standards			1
" this defied reason and @entity4 's own terms , which prohibit posts that " attack others based on their race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , sex , gender , sexual orientation , disability or medical condition			1
" in a widely reported move this week , @entity4 , to its credit , changed its response and is improving its efforts to crack down on such content			1
i 'm recounting here what preceded this decision , because it is instructive both about our culture and what it takes to change it — with this media giant and potentially other sites			2
over the past six months i communicated with @entity4 employees to understand their process for determining what content met their criteria and on what those judgments were based			2
at each stage , they were open , clear about their policies and guidelines and their commitment to balancing user safety with freedom of expression			0
@entity4 in fact had in place the formal language of a reasonable content policy geared toward ensuring users ' safety , but it was not implementing it effectively			1
this failure disproportionately affected girls and women			0
the only conclusion could be that individual moderators were interpreting the polices in ways that were gender biased			2
how ? when 16 - year - old boys in @entity114 feel comfortable sharing their rape of a 12 - year - old - girl for status points , when a group of men in @entity121 film their gang - rape of a young woman by the side of the road and post it for hundreds of people to " like , " and when content reviewers daily consider these and related images depicting women scared and cowering , bruised and beaten , to be acceptable , it 's not a " glitch " in the system			1
these images are not created by @entity4			1
but they regular pass through the @entity4 content review process run by people — people whose sexist norms are reflective of the larger culture , and who govern what is " appropriate			1
" last tuesday , i joined @entity142 , executive director of @entity144 , and @entity145 , founder of the @entity147 , to launch a global campaign to confront institutionalized sexism in media			0
we wrote an open letter to @entity4 , co-signed by more than 100 organizations , asking the company to take concrete steps to better understand gender - based hate speech on its site and to train people to recognize violence against women as hateful			1
we encouraged users of @entity4 to send messages to its advertisers encouraging them to boycott the social media network until it addressed our concerns			2
over seven days , men and women around the world sent more than 60,000 tweets using the hashtag # @entity171 , and 5,000 e-mails to targeted advertisers , 16 of whom withdrew their advertising			0
in a rare statement on its site on wednesday , @entity4 responded , noting that its " systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively " as they would like and they pledging to evaluate and update policies , guidelines and practices relating to hate speech			1
the company acknowledged the importance of improving training for content moderators ( the focus of our requests ) , so they are better able to understand gender - based hate			2
the company said these steps will be taken in collaboration with representatives from @entity144 , the @entity147 and members of our broader community			0
why did we focus on @entity4 ? because it is a microcosm of a global culture			1
this week , people have repeatedly asked me , " is @entity4 sexist ? " " is it @entity4 's geek boy tech culture ? " no , i suspect that @entity4 is no more or less sexist or misogynistic than any other aspect of our culture and media			1
but unlike culture at large or " the @entity211 , " @entity4 created a useful mechanism for change			1
it wrote rules about speech			0
once @entity4 built a structure to review content , it established itself as an arbiter of norms			2
by doing this , it became a potential agent of positive change for the purposes of confronting historic media imbalances and commonly accepted gender prejudices			2
it was because @entity4 had clearly thought about these topics and invested significant resources in creating a structured and detailed content review process and guidelines for user interactions that we focused on it			2
no , this is not feminists censoring the @entity211			0
we are only demanding that @entity4 apply its existing content policy rules to women fairly			1
the fact is , the threat of violence silences women every day -- on and offline			0
for example , content considered worthy of removal at @entity4 for being unsafe must threaten " imminent harm			2
" " imminent harm " is a luxury for women who experience rape and domestic violence as pervasive threats			0
the notion of imminent harm will never be equally applicable to men and women as a baseline criterion , as long as we live in a world where women feel far less safe than men			0
in the @entity263 , for example , men are 25 % more likely to feel safe walking in public at night then women are			0
we do n't live at the @entity265			0
what woman can afford to wait until the harm is imminent , when we all adapt our lives to avoid rape and , for one in four or us in the @entity263 , the daily terrorism of abuse ? some 70 % of women on the planet will experience violence at the hands of men , most often men they know			0
people concerned with the potential loss of free speech on the @entity211 would do well to reprioritize their efforts on this actual loss of free speech being experienced purely as a function of a human being 's sex			0
our campaign resonated with so many because we are in the midst of a shifting cultural tide in which gender based violence -- historically kept private -- is better understood as a pandemic problem , including in the public forum of the @entity211			1
@entity4 's response is important and indeed may both represent and reflect a cultural shift			1
it 's important because @entity4 's action represents an open acknowledgment that violence against women is a serious issue -- not openly stated in the past in the context of this content -- and that it deserves serious attention			1
making that acknowledgment an institutional reality is what we will now strive to do .			0

@entity309 : @entity311 images of women abuse on @entity4 *sparked* drive for change
she says @entity4 was not effectively enforcing own rules ; women bore brunt of abuses
she says moderators ' gender bias to blame , but it 's *rooted* in our larger culture of misogyny
@entity309 : @entity4 addressing problem ; hopefully cultural tide will start to shift as well
