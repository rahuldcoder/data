-- as @entity3 celebrates the 50th anniversary of the founding of the @entity6 , the focus of the celebrations is renewing @entity3 's vision for continental unification as envisaged by its founding fathers such @entity10			1
it is not the lack of political will that hampers @entity3 regional integration , it is poor infrastructure			2
@entity3 's challenges have less to do with fragmentation of state but more to do with the lack of infrastructure connectivity , especially energy , transportation , irrigation and telecommunications			1
the @entity26 estimates that @entity3 will need to invest nearly $ 93 billion annually over the next decade to meet its infrastructure needs			1
a third of this cost will go to maintenance			0
part of this investment can be met through public and private sector investment , including novel facilities such as the infrastructure bonds proposed by the @entity36			2
but the urgency to address @entity3 's infrastructure requires additional non-conventional interventions such as the mobilization of the continent 's armed forces			1
historically , there is a long legacy of military involvement in infrastructure projects going back to the @entity47 days			1

they regularly use such facilities during emergencies and are at the forefront of developing robust systems such as smart microgrid systems that can provide decentralized power supply for rural @entity3			2
what is needed is an explicit policy to extend their role in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure projects in cooperation with civilian agencies			1
many @entity53 countries have been converting military facilities to support civilian infrastructure activities			1
@entity77 , for example , turned a military barracks into the @entity79 , which played a vital role in the reconstruction of the country after the genocide			0
the role of the military in @entity77 's civilian affairs involves a wide range of operations which include the awareness - raising annual @entity89			2
one of the most explicit commitments to the role of the military in infrastructure projects comes from @entity93			1
the country 's armed forces recently established @entity3 's first @entity96 which is training engineers to build and maintain infrastructure projects			1
@entity93 has been collaborating with the @entity99 on how to rehabilitate its railway networks			0
read this : @entity3 's private security forces bigger than army these efforts are targeted interventions and differ remarkably with cases such as @entity107 , where the military controls a large proportion of the economy			1
it is much harder for countries where the military is an economic class to be creative			0
the role of the military in civilian projects needs to be under democratic control for it to rise above popular suspicions and distrust			2
@entity120 , for example , has established clear policies and operational guidelines that have since independence steered its " @entity125 " program			0
the program includes activities in infrastructure ( especially water supply and road construction ) , healthcare and environmental management			0
in 1999 @entity120 set up the civil - military committee in support of development to bring together representatives from parliament , the military , government ministries , civil society and the private sector to collaborate on implementing public programs			0
its broad membership helps to foster trust and coordination			0
it can be argued that deploying the military in civilian infrastructure activities could divert attention from essential defense functions			2
to the contrary , the military would strengthen its national security activities by building infrastructure projects			1

poor infrastructure and lack of economic opportunity traps populations in spirals of poverty and conflict over limited resources			0
countries such as @entity170 and @entity171 are responding to the challenges of poverty to deploy their armed forces to fill the gap in civilian capacity to build infrastructure projects			1
similarly , building robust infrastructure networks makes it easier to police national borders			0
investments in earth observation satellite infrastructure , as well as the ability to deploy troops along national boundaries , is an important element in maintaining peace			0
infrastructure built to address economic needs has the additional purpose of helping to maintain internal law and order as well as maintenance of national security			0
new countries such as @entity195 face the challenge of keeping large armies that were built up to fight for independence			0
they can choose to dismantle their armed forces or convert them to a force of development			0
they are better advised to do the latter ; their potential role in infrastructure rehabilitation pays for peace building			0
as @entity3 celebrates the 50th anniversary of its declaration of unification , it should also reflect on the fact that it has recorded about 80 successful military coups			2
led by an increasing number of technocratic presidents , @entity3 's armies can give future generations hope by helping to build infrastructure -- the motherboard for all economic activities			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			0

military should be mobilized for infrastructure projects , argues @entity228 *professor*
many @entity53 countries converting military facilities to support civilian activities , says @entity223
@entity93 's army created @entity235 , where it trains engineers
@entity26 estimates @entity3 must invest $ 93 billion annually in infrastructure in next 10 years
