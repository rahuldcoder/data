@entity0 -- a leading opponent of a proposed mosque and community center near @entity5 is asking a question that looms as large as the towers that stood nearby less than nine years ago : " why there ? " @entity9 , a conservative blogger who leads a group called stop the @entity11 , posed the question on @entity1 's " @entity13 " wednesday			1
" we feel that it is a cemetery and sacred ground and the dead should be honored , " @entity9 said			2
" to build a 13 - story mega mosque on the cemetery , on the site of the largest attack in @entity22 history , i think , is incredibly insensitive			1
" those for and against the proposed mosque butted heads during a passionate three - hour hearing of @entity0 's @entity27 tuesday night			1
officially , the hearing was a forum for testimony on whether the building at 45 - 47 @entity32 , near @entity5 , is worth preserving			1
the structure dates back to the late 1850s			2
@entity27 spokeswoman @entity34 said the building housed the headquarters of the @entity38 pharmaceutical company in the 1920s and in more recent years served as a discount clothing store			1
she said she was not sure what the current owner -- the @entity43 outreach group the @entity44 -- has been doing with the building , but people attending tuesday night 's meeting said it was being used for prayer services			1
the commission is expected to vote in august on whether to grant the structure landmark status , even though the @entity53 of lower @entity54 said earlier this month the building was n't architecturally significant enough to merit the designation			1
@entity57 said landmark status alone would not prevent the @entity59 from making alterations to the existing structure or making it into an @entity64 cultural center			0
while the designation is designed to preserve the exterior appearance of a building in @entity0 , it does not restrict the use of a building , nor does it prevent a property owner from adding on floors , she said			1
even if the building on @entity32 is declared a landmark , " changes can be made to a landmark building with approval from the @entity27 , " de @entity57 said			1
in fact , there are examples in @entity0 where buildings with landmark status were drastically altered			0
the @entity85 building , a modern 46 - story skyscraper in @entity54 , rises out of a six - story depression - era , @entity89 facade with landmark status			1
the original design was for a skyscraper , but construction came to a halt when the @entity95 hit			0
in the latter half of the 20th century , the @entity27 approved a plan to add on the modern skyscraper while preserving the original facade			1
supporters of the @entity32 preservation are opposed to a project by the @entity44 and the @entity103 to build their mosque and community center so close to the site where the twin towers of the @entity108 were destroyed by @entity110 hijackers on september 11 , 2001			1
the contentious nature of the hearing was expected , because if the commission rules the structure now at the site does n't deserve the landmark status , the groups behind the project wo n't need any additional city permission to demolish the old building and move ahead with the mosque construction			1
voices opposing the mosque dominated the hearing			2
" it would be a terrible mistake to destroy a 154 - year - old building in order to build a monument to terrorism , " one woman said			2
some at the hearing , including @entity134 gubernatorial candidate @entity133 , expressed suspicion about @entity135 , who heads the @entity44			0
@entity136 was out of the country and did not attend the hearing			0
@entity139 called for an investigation into its funding			0
" we 're asking for a delay in the process to get some answers , " @entity133 said			0
the heckling and intense nature of the hearing got to be too much for some participants			0
" i 'm ashamed to be an @entity22 today , " said @entity150 , a @entity151 , who reminded the crowd that people from many countries and religions died on september 11			0
" i want to prove to this hall that i am a citizen , " @entity150 said , holding up his passport			0
some @entity43 community leaders say the mosque could provide an opportunity for improving interfaith relations			2
" we 're saying @entity43 have a legitimate role to play in the social fabric of this country , " said @entity163 , the director of the @entity164 of the @entity165 , on @entity1 's " @entity13 " wednesday			2
" we are part of the interfaith mosaic of the @entity22			0
but more than that , i think this particular group of people in the @entity174 can do a huge amount of good not only for @entity43 in @entity0 but also for interfaith relations throughout the country , " @entity163 added			0
the @entity44 says it aims to improve relations between @entity43 and the @entity179			0
" the @entity44 hopes to build a $ 100 million , 13 - story community center with @entity64 , interfaith and secular programming , similar to the @entity185 , " its website says , referring to the cultural institution on the upper east side of @entity54			0
the project calls for a mosque , a performing arts center , gym , swimming pool and other public spaces			1
@entity1 's @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			2

*emotions* flare during a meeting of the @entity27
the commission 's vote is expected in august
if the commission rules that the building is not worth saving , the mosque project can proceed
the mosque is to be built near the site of the destroyed twin towers
