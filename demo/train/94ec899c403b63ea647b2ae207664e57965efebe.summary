-- modern travel is an intensely visual experience			2
we feast our eyes on glossy guidebooks before bombarding @entity6 and @entity7 with our oh - so stylish shots of footprints on empty beaches , stunning sunsets and that weird thing we found in the pool			2
but in our efforts to soak up the sights and stuff our hard drives with selfies , we may be neglecting another vital element of the travel experience -- sound			2
that 's the worry of @entity22 , a @entity23 acoustic engineer who , armed with a microphone and digital recorder , has spent several years earwigging his way around the planet in search of what he calls its " sonic wonders			1
" " we 're used to going on our travels and looking out for beautiful vistas and wonderful architecture , but we tend not to think about the sound , " says @entity22 , who was struck by the notion of exploring a wider world of sound while investigating echoes in , of all places , a @entity36 sewer			1
" so then i began to think about where i would go if you wanted listen to the most remarkable sounds in the world and i was surprised to find there was relatively little information , " he tells @entity0			1
" that 's when i thought i should gather it myself			2
" more : big thrills -- 50 ways to be a daredevil @entity22 has documented his adventures in audio in the newly published " @entity52 " ( released as " @entity53 " in the @entity23 ) -- a fascinating journey which , over several years , takes him from scorching desert sands to slimy subterranean chambers			1
he also runs a website aimed at encouraging others to explore sonic wonders and engage in " sound tourism , " and points out that since most travelers carry cell phones , they 're already equipped with powerful recording devices			2
" it 's all about making yourself aware and thinking as you wander around about what you are going to catch -- but all you really need to do is listen			2
" it 's about time to make some noise about sound tourism			2
with the aid of @entity22 , we 've compiled a list of the world 's best sonic destinations			1
singing sands ( @entity77 ) where : @entity79 in @entity77 's @entity80 what : when in contact with sliding humans , peculiarities in the sand produce deep parping sounds resembling propeller aircraft or sousaphone accidents			1
@entity22 says : " this one was always high on my bucket list			1
you need the right sort of dune with the right size sand grains			1
when you scoot down on your backside you get this weird droning			2
rustic but charming establishment that offers rooms with shared bathrooms and eco-lodges			0
107355 nipton road , @entity96 ; +1 760 856 2335 hear the sands bearded singing seals ( @entity103 ) where : @entity105 , a bleak @entity103 archipelago of ice - capped mountains and fierce polar bears way out in the @entity109 what : mind - bending , sub-aquatic sci - fi effects produced by hairy - faced sea mammals to woo their mates -- a soundscape worryingly similar to the tinnitus hangover of a @entity117 gig			0
@entity22 says : " they do n't really sound like animals , they sound like @entity121 coming in to land -- they make this extraordinary noise that lasts about a minute			1
efficient chain hotel with spectacular fjord views and even more spectacular prices ( this is @entity103 )			0
@entity128 9171 , @entity129 ; +47 79 02 34 50 hear the seals chirping @entity132 pyramid ( @entity133 ) where : @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity133 what : clap your hands in front of this 1,100 - year - old structure and you 'll hear an echo not unlike the sacred quetzal bird			1
only disturbing if you 've seen the 2008 film " @entity146 , " in which sound - mimicking vines devour feckless tourists atop a @entity132 pyramid			0
@entity22 says : in his book , @entity22 asks whether the echo was a @entity132 design reflecting sophisticated acoustic knowledge : " imagine an ancient @entity132 priest presiding over a ceremony and , with great theatricality , summoning the sound of the quetzal bird by clapping his hands			1
" stay : if you want to avoid staying with the crowds in @entity136 , the @entity137 's culturally lively capital of @entity161 is just down the road			0
the @entity161 is a tranquil converted colonial mansion set around an airy courtyard			0
@entity166 , @entity161 ; +52 999 928 - 8466 hear the pyramid gong rocks ( @entity169 ) where : @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity169 -- and other sites across @entity174 what : not a prog rock group , but one of several eons - old boulders that produce mellow notes when whacked with smaller stones			1
tonally , their range can be a bit on the monotonous side , but the fact that it probably resonates back to the dawn of civilization helps raise neck hairs			0
@entity22 says : " among the earliest evidence we have of what our ancestors might have listened to is left over bits of musical instruments like these rock gongs			1
" stay : you 'll need pockets big enough to hold a gong rock to afford to stay in the swanky safari camps of the southern serengeti			0
@entity174 ( +255 78 822 1440 ) is typically luxurious			0
hear the rocks whispering gallery ( @entity202 ) where : @entity205 mausoleum , in @entity206 , a town in southwestern @entity202 's @entity209 state what : this majestic , rose - domed structure built in the 1600s features one of the best examples of a whispering gallery -- an elevated architectural echo chamber that seems to sample human voices and loop them repetitively in the style of a 1960s horror flick			0
@entity22 says : in " @entity52 , " @entity22 writes : " with children enjoying yelling and listening as their voices repeat over and over again , the atmosphere is like a crowded day at the swimming pool			1
" stay : humdrum hotels abound in @entity206 , but head south and you 'll find @entity226			0
the @entity227 looks like a retirement village but pulls in good reviews			0
@entity230 , @entity226 ; +91 99 01 91 21 27 hear the gallery bubbling mud pots ( @entity233 ) where : @entity235 , @entity236 , northern @entity233 what : a sulfurous volcanic landscape where noxious gas belches forth from roiling cauldrons of primordial gunge with the fury of a waterfall			1
@entity22 says : " tumultuous pools of battleship - gray mud bubble at a low simmer , " @entity22 writes in his book			1
" they seem almost alive ; some belch like a thick , gloppy lentil soup while others rage and splatter like an unappetizing gruel on a fast boil			0
" stay : @entity255 ( @entity256 16 , 640 @entity257 ; +354 463 3399 ) is in the tiny fishing town of @entity259			0
here you can also pay a visit local museums dedicated to @entity233 history , whales and , of course , penises			1
hear the mud pots @entity269 's longest reverberations ( @entity270 ) where : inchindown oil storage complex / @entity275 's @entity274 mausoleum -- @entity270 what : @entity22 crawled down slippery pipes to access a vast , empty @entity279 oil tank built into a @entity270 hillside near the town of @entity282 to measure the reverberations within			1
using a starting gun ( and a saxophone ) , he pegged them at a record - breaking 75 seconds			0
sadly , since @entity288 is rarely open to the public , sonic tourists will have to make do with a trip to the previous @entity292 record holder , also in @entity270			0
the grand @entity293 , just outside @entity275 , clocks in at 15 seconds			0
stay : classy @entity295 action at 15 @entity275 , in the middle of @entity270 's vibrant second city			0
@entity298 , @entity275 ; +44 141 332 12 63 hear the @entity300 oil tank echo musical road ( @entity77 ) where : @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity77 what : a series of grooves gouged into the pavement renders a stretch of the westbound roadway into an instrument that plays the " @entity312 " -- also known as the " @entity314 " theme -- when vehicles drive over it			0
the rhythm is recognizable , but the tune sounds like someone gargling with water in an adjacent room			2
@entity22 says : " it is a very bad rendition of the ' @entity312 ' -- but it makes you laugh			1
" stay : overnight stays are only for fans of underwhelming chain hotels or tired motels			0
keep driving and you 'll hit @entity77 's i - 5 highway for a drive north for stellar scenery and , you never know , some amazing sounds			2

@entity23 acoustic engineer @entity22 gathered sounds from the world for " @entity52 "
sliding down certain sand dunes can produce sounds like a propeller plane
@entity22 has recorded sounds from @entity135 in @entity133 to bubbling mud pots in @entity233
