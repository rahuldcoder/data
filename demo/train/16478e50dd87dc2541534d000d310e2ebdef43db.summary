the @entity0 says it has opened a criminal investigation of the @entity2 , which is grappling with a scandal over long waiting lists to provide care and allegations that paperwork was faked to make delays appear shorter			1
fbi director @entity9 told a @entity11 hearing on wednesday the bureau 's @entity13 office has joined an ongoing review by the @entity2 inspector general			1
the move at least partly satisfies requests from key members of @entity20 from both parties who have pressed for a full probe by the @entity24 as the scandal accelerated in recent weeks and led to the resignation of va secretary @entity27 in may			1
officials have said the inspector general is sharing findings with federal prosecutors , and the @entity24 could launch a full - blown criminal probe if any of the information meets the standard for doing so			1
@entity34 has reported over the past seven months on the va problems , including that managers in @entity13 and elsewhere used secret waiting lists to cover up the amount of time it took for veterans to get appointments			2
at wednesday 's hearing , @entity9 would not say whether the investigation would be expanded beyond the initial allegations at the @entity13 medical facility , but said the @entity0 was " working with the @entity47 and will follow this wherever the facts take us			1
" igs are the internal watchdogs of federal agencies and usually conduct administrative audits for fraud or other abuse			0
sometimes those reviews result in federal prosecution			0
typically , the @entity24 waits for reviews by inspectors general to be completed before deciding whether to jump in			0
in this case , a @entity24 spokesman said , " at the department 's direction , the @entity0 has instructed agents in its @entity13 office to conduct an investigation into the allegations related to the @entity2			1
federal prosecutors will be working with these investigators to determine whether there is a basis for criminal charges			2
" widespread problems at the @entity2 's health care facilities have persisted for years but questions intensified over the past several months amid fresh media and congressional scrutiny			2
an internal @entity2 audit released monday found that tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care , while even more who signed up in the @entity2 system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested			1
the @entity2 has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care			1
despite efforts to address some issues in recent years , including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans , the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care			2
reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in @entity104 and @entity105 , and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment			0
lawmakers for weeks have flocked to tv cameras and issued statements to urge the @entity24 to start its own investigation			0
but there 's recent precedent for the department to be wary of the political pressure			0
the department quickly announced its probe into the @entity121 after reports of alleged targeting of conservative political groups			0
the @entity121 investigation continues , but so far investigators have n't found proof of a chargeable crime , according to people briefed on the case			0
as a result , the department is under fire from @entity135 lawmakers for not bringing charges			0
separately , the @entity11 has unanimously approved legislation to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at @entity143 facilities at the government 's expense			2
a similar measure has been proposed in the @entity147 , which could act later this week			0
vets could get care outside @entity2 under bill passed by @entity11 audit : more than 120,000 veterans waiting or never got care			1

@entity0 director tells @entity20 investigators " will follow this to wherever the facts take us "
