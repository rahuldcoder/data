-- ten years ago , @entity1 was expecting her pregnant daughter , @entity2 , at dinner on @entity4			1
instead , she received a call that @entity2 was missing			1
teams of police and community members scoured the woods and fields near @entity11 , @entity12 , that night , again on christmas day , and for weeks afterward , but there was no sign of her			2
four months later , her body washed ashore 90 miles away in the @entity17			0
but it is @entity4 , not springtime , that stirs a deep sadness in @entity2 's mother			1
every @entity4 season brings a reminder that @entity2 's life and her unborn son 's were taken during what should have been a time of joy and anticipation			1
" it 's still hard to believe it happened , and that it 's been 10 years , " @entity30 said thursday over the phone , speaking slowly , her voice cracking			1
as the bright lights go up in the neighborhood , and @entity4 carols fill the air , she says , " my mind wanders back			0
" the words do not flow easily			0
even now , @entity30 finds it difficult to speak of her heartbreak without being overcome by tears			0
the parents of the 6 - and 7 - year - olds slain at @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , are just embarking on the painful journey that @entity30 has been on for a decade			0
if anyone knows the pain of celebrating the holidays when they are indelibly connected to tragedy , it is @entity1			1
does she have any advice for the parents of @entity50 ? not really			0
you have no other choice			0
with a decade 's worth of hindsight , @entity30 sees a pattern in her sadness			1
the holidays are particularly hard every year			2
" it will probably be like this forever , " she sighs			0
this year was one of the hard ones , perhaps the hardest			0
her unease began months earlier			0
her son @entity75 and his family also live in @entity12 , and @entity30 has four grandchildren			2
they help fill the void left by the deaths of @entity2 and her unborn child , a boy who would have been born that february and named @entity83			1
one of her grandsons is close to the age @entity83 would be			0
the grandkids help @entity30 enjoy the holidays , " to an extent , " she says			2
" if it were n't for the grandkids , though , i would n't have a @entity4			0
" she thinks often of the grandson she never knew , wondering what @entity83 would have looked like , what his personality would have been like			0
@entity2 's half - sister @entity97 ( they shared a father ) is a hairstylist and still cuts @entity30 's hair			1
@entity30 may not be related to @entity97 by blood , but she feels closer to @entity2 when she 's with @entity97 , and has gotten to know her better over the years			1
@entity97 is expecting her first child , a son , in february			2
is it an eerie coincidence , or perhaps just sisters in sync ? for years , @entity30 would burst into tears when she used her blow dryer			2
now she knows why : @entity97 was teaching @entity2 how to style her long , straight , glossy hair with a curling iron right before @entity2 vanished			1
the weeks after @entity2 disappeared were a blur as @entity30 waited to hear from her daughter or find out what had happened to her			1
@entity30 and others slowly grew suspicious of @entity2 's husband , @entity115			1
they came to believe from his odd behavior that he not only knew what happened to her , he killed her himself			0
by the time his wife 's body washed up , @entity115 seemed poised to flee the country			1
he was arrested in @entity122			0
he had dyed his hair			0
prosecutors posited this theory at his trial : @entity2 , who was having an extramarital affair with a massage therapist , smothered or strangled @entity2 in the bedroom of their @entity11 home on december 23 or 24 , 2002			1
he then dumped her body in the @entity17 during a @entity4 fishing trip			0
but there was little forensic evidence , and @entity2 maintains his innocence to this day			1
the former fertilizer salesman , who was married to @entity2 for five years , was convicted of murdering @entity2 and @entity83			1
he was sentenced to death , which appears to be years away			2
hundreds of people gathered outside the courthouse and cheered the jury 's decision			2
@entity30 does n't follow the news about @entity2			1
but she knew something happened in his case last summer because of all the voice mail messages she received			0
@entity2 's attorneys had just filed his appeal and the media wanted her reaction			1
she read no further than the first page of the court filing , which asks for a new trial			0
@entity30 sold the home she lived in when @entity2 disappeared , but she still lives in @entity11			2
@entity2 and @entity115 's house on @entity11 's @entity157 is for sale again , listed at less than half the 2005 purchase price of $ 390,000			1
@entity160 is a correspondent for @entity161 , which is produced by @entity162 and airs on sister network @entity161			0
she covered the @entity115 trial .			2
