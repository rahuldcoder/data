-- there 's a good chance you 'll either drink too much eggnog this holiday season or spend time around someone who has			1
here 's a look at the background of this december staple			2
@entity10 can trace its roots back as far as the 14th century , when medieval englishmen enjoyed a hot cocktail known as posset			1
@entity16 did n't contain eggs -- the @entity18 describes it as " a drink made of hot milk curdled with ale , wine , or the like , often sweeten ed and spiced ' -- but over the years eggs joined in on the festive fun			1
while the egg - laden version of posset was popular with the @entity29 , it became less common as time went by			1
milk and eggs were both scarce and expensive , and the sherry and @entity34 used to spike the mixture was pricey , too			1
over time , the concoction became a drink that only aristocrats could really afford			0
all of that changed in the @entity41 colonies , though			1
what we lacked in parliamentary representation we made up for in easy access to dairy products and liquor			0
since many @entity41 had their own chickens and dairy cattle , tossing together a glass of eggnog was no problem , and the drink 's popularity soared among the colonists even as it sagged back home			1
this disparity in the drink 's popularity on either side of the pond endures to this day ; eggnog 's popularity in the @entity64			2
still lags far behind its holiday ubiquity here in the @entity41			2
in fact , here 's how the @entity71 's @entity70 memorably described the drink in 2006 : " people rarely get it right , but even if you do it still tastes horrible			0
the smell is like an omelette and the consistency defies belief			0
it lurches around the glass like partially - sentient sludge			0
" appetizing ! using your noggin the word " eggnog " itself has fairly murky origins , but many etymologists think the name stems from the word " noggin , " which referred to small wooden mugs that were often used to serve this type of drink			0
others propose a similar story but explain that the " nog " comes the @entity100 slang nog to refer to the strong ales that were often served in these cups			0
still others think the name is a contraction of colonial @entity41 ' request to bartenders for an " egg - and - grog " when they wanted a glass			1
furthermore , while the drink itself may date back to medieval times , the word " eggnog " is a relatively recent invention			0
the first recorded instances of the use of " eggnog " only date back to the late 18th century , and by that time , bartenders in the young @entity41 had already tweaked the recipe to give it a more @entity41 twist			1
the @entity34 and sherry that @entity29 aristocrats had used for their version of eggnog were scarce on this side of the pond , but we had plenty of rum and whiskey			1
in 1800 , author @entity135 described the @entity41 recipe for eggnog as consisting of " new milk , eggs , rum , and sugar , beat up together			1
" @entity0 : the pooping log and other colorful holiday characters have one for @entity144 yes , early @entity41 loved their eggnog , and you can use this fact to your advantage if you down a few too many glasses this year			1
simply point out that you 're in good company with the likes of @entity144			2
kitchen records from @entity153 indicate that @entity154 served an eggnog - like drink to visitors , and since the general was n't strapped for cash , he did n't skimp on the sauce			2
@entity154 's potent recipe included three different types of booze : rye whiskey , rum , and sherry			1
nobody could tell a lie after having a few cups of that			0
not everyone had @entity154 's funds , though			0
a thorough look at historical recipes reveals that for most tipplers , the type of booze they snuck into their nog did n't really matter as long as there was something to give it a little kick			0
in addition to rum , ale , whiskey , and wines , an 1879 collection of recipes from @entity185 housewives features a recipe that calls for 12 eggs , eight wine - glassfuls of brandy , and four wine - glassfuls of wine			1
another calls for three dozen eggs , half a gallon of domestic brandy , and another half - pint of @entity203 brandy			2
something 's telling us these shindigs got a little wild			0
you might not want to read the label if you pick up a carton of commercial eggnog at the supermarket , you 're probably getting much more nog than egg			0
@entity216 regulations only require that 1.0 percent of a product 's final weight be made up of egg yolk solids for it to bear the eggnog name			2
for " eggnog flavored milk , " the bar is even lower ; in addition to requiring less butterfat in the recipe , this label only requires 0.5 percent egg yolk solids in the carton			1
of course , there are other good reasons why we do n't tip back eggnog year - round			2
sure , nobody 's reaching for a nice cup of something custardy on a hot day , but it 's not very good for you at all			1
a relatively small four - ounce cup of store - bought eggnog boasts a whopping 170 calories ( half of them from fat ) , nearly 10 grams of fat , and over 70 mg of cholesterol			1
( if you 're keeping score at home , that 's around a quarter of your recommended daily intake of cholesterol			0
) if you choose to eschew these commercial brands in favor of mixing up your own eggnog , you 'll probably want to use pasteurized eggs to suppress the risk of a nasty case of salmonella ; not even a playlist featuring " @entity260 ? " ruins a holiday party quite as quickly as making everyone in attendance violently ill. do n't use unpasteurized eggs under the old argument of " the booze will kill the germs , " either			1
the @entity216 advises that this strategy is n't likely to work			0
@entity0 : the history of christmas tree lights an unhealthy obsession nutritional info aside , eggnog still has a strong following among holiday drinkers			0
it 's hard to top the devotion shared by a @entity185 father and son in the late 19th century , though			0
in 1900 , @entity280 ran a story about the @entity283 - morning eggnog traditions of @entity185 , and it included this anecdote : " so religiously is this custom of the eggnog drinking observed that @entity287 of @entity288 tells a story of rushing in on christmas morning to warn his father that the house was on fire			1
the old gentleman first led his son to the breakfast table and ladled out his glass of eggnog , drank one with him , then went to care for the burning building			0
" true or not , the story certainly underscores the downright magical powers of eggnog			0
nobody 's braving a burning building to have a cup of fruit punch or spiced cider			2
