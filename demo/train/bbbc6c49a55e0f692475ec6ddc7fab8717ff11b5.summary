as teenagers , the women of the @entity2 tribe pierce their lower lips and put a clay plate in it			0
they are one of the last tribes in the world who still practice this tradition and the new generation , influenced by the outside world , might decide to abandon it			1
that 's why @entity17 photographer @entity16 decided to travel the world for three years , visiting 35 tribes in all five continents , to document their lives and customs before they disappear			1
he drank vodka with the @entity26 @entity25 tribe in freezing conditions and admired the beautiful @entity29 tribesmen in the @entity30			0
the result of his journey can be found in his new book of photographs , " before they pass away			1
" " the whole idea is to make ( the tribes ) iconic			2
to give them the attention that we give ourselves in the developed world , " the 45 - year - old photographer says			2
from a very early age , @entity16 was confronted by cultural diversity			1
he grew up in different @entity46 countries before moving to @entity47 at the age of seven to attend a catholic @entity50 boarding school			0
going back to @entity46 to meet with nine tribes in four different countries was a special experience for him			2
read this : modernizing the @entity55 to avoid extinction " @entity46 is evolving the quickest in my opinion			0
it has lost the majority of its ethnicity and authenticity , " he says			0
" i grew up in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and in @entity68			0
i 've been living for 45 years , and what i saw in my childhood is not there anymore			0
" being humble @entity16 and his crew , consisting of an assistant and a cameraman , covered @entity46 in five trips			1
they visited five tribes in @entity78 , and one each in @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
@entity16 says the most challenging part of his @entity46 journeys was approaching the tribes in southern @entity78			1
" there are many small tribes in a small area and everybody is protecting their own turf			2
so they can be quite intimidating , " he says			0
when first approaching the tribes , @entity16 left the camera equipment behind			1
he says even though all the tribes had been documented before , he was conscious to explain to them what he wanted to do			1
only the @entity80 tribe , @entity98 , knew he was coming			1
@entity99 : ' @entity100 is just like throwing a spear ' although he was always traveling with a local guide , @entity16 had to rely on body language and gestures to communicate with the different tribesmen and gain their trust			1
but he says it was all about appealing to their vanity			0
" initially it 's idolization			0
you put them on a pedestal and then you touch their muscles and show that through lots of gestures , lots of hero - worship , " @entity16 explains of his initial meetings with the @entity78 tribes , who would often greet him carrying @entity121 rifles			1
" you arrive and they are all wild and intimidating , it 's all about being macho			0
" one thing that stood out to @entity16 when meeting the different @entity46 tribes was their awareness of their appearances			1
he says he noticed a lot of male vanity in the @entity46 tribes			2
for example , many people think the men in the @entity82 @entity29 tribe are actually women			2
" this is a classic example of the whole idea behind the book that appearances can be deceptive , " he says			2
" very few of us will ever look as beautiful as these people			0
" the @entity29 : @entity82 's iconic red women signs of modernization when @entity16 and his crew traveled across the @entity152 four years ago , to find the southern @entity78 tribes , it took them three weeks to reach them			1
today , he says , the roads have been improved and it only takes a few days			0
he thinks this is one of the reasons some of the tribes are slowly abandoning their traditional lifestyle			2
" at the moment ( the @entity46 tribes ) are evolving quickly because of the digital age			0
many of them have a mobile telephone , so they are aware of an outside world , " he says			0
the book " before they pass away " is just the first third of his project			2
the next step is to go back to all 35 tribes and show them their photos , explaining to them why he made them			1
the idea is to then visit another 35 tribes in more politically unstable areas , where he would need the authorities ' help to get access			1
but most of all @entity16 hopes the portraits will encourage a deeper dialogue between the tribes and the developed world			1
" by illustrating these people in a grand aesthetic , romantic , idealistic and iconic way , i 'm trying to attract the public 's attention to a subject matter that they would n't normally be interested in , " the photographer explains			0
before @entity16 embarked on his three - year - long journey , he was just expecting to make a visual document to celebrate the tribes for what they looked like			1
but now he thinks there are greater lessons to be learned			0
" in my eyes the tribespeople are emotionally and socially very rich but materially very poor , and we ( in the @entity206 ) are the opposite , " he says			0
" how aware of how special they are is debatable , hence why i want to start this discussion			0

@entity16 photographed 35 tribes all over the world for book " ' before they pass away "
@entity16 photographed tribes in @entity78 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82
he wanted to create a record of " a fast disappearing world "
