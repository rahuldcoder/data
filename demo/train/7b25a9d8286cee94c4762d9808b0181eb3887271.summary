-- few 15 - year - olds can claim to make history , but @entity3 is fast accumulating a clutch of firsts in football			1
by coming on as a second half substitute in @entity9 's clash with @entity10 on monday , he became the youngest player ever to appear in @entity13 qualifying at just 15 years and 300 days			1
he is already the youngest player to represent his country -- featuring in a friendly with @entity16 in august -- as well as the youngest player , and scorer , in the country 's top league			1
and @entity3 did n't look out of place during his 27 - minute cameo , as @entity9 beat @entity10 2 - 1 in its @entity23 clash			1
no wonder then , that scouts from clubs all over @entity26 -- including @entity29 pair @entity27 and @entity30 -- are on the tail of one of the continent 's hottest prospects			0
" in the beginning it was unreal and a little bit surreal that all these clubs wanted @entity3 , but it 's strange what you can get used to , " his father @entity36 told @entity0 last month			2
" almost every top @entity26 club has been in touch			0
" ex-norway international @entity44 has described @entity3 's potential as " unbelievable , " while manager @entity46 -- who gave the teen his @entity49 debut before joining @entity51 club @entity50 -- says he can " become the best in the world			2
" and if the teeanger 's ascent in the game carries on at this pace , soon he and his father will have a big decision to make on his future			2
" i saw from a very early age that ' he had the feeling , ' but i remember very well when i knew he 'd be quite good , " @entity3 's father , a former footballer at @entity49 and @entity62 , added			2
" i was still playing and @entity3 must have been no more than eight			0
i was out on the pitch running some intervals			0
he was , as always , with me			0
when i was finished i wanted to go home , but we could n't before he had done 50 more shots ( at goal )			0
" then i understood he also had a talent for training and that is the most important talent you can have			0
" it is conceivable @entity3 may get to showcase his talents on one of the biggest soccer stages of all given @entity9 's impressive start to its @entity85 campaign			1
that 2 - 1 victory , earned thanks to goals from @entity89 and @entity90 , put @entity9 third in its group , behind @entity93 , who are top , and @entity95			1
@entity93 thrashed @entity96 6 - 0 while @entity95 edged past @entity97 1 - 0 thanks to a first senior goal for @entity99 , who plays for @entity100 in the @entity29			1
@entity102 inspiration the biggest shock of the night came in @entity104 where @entity105 made it three wins out of three after beating @entity108 2 - 0			1
it is the first time in @entity105 's history it has won the opening three matches of a qualifying campaign without conceding a goal			1
just like he was in the win over @entity117 on friday , @entity115 was @entity105 's hero , scoring twice in a famous win over a side that finished third at the @entity120 in @entity121			1
@entity115 , who plays in the @entity29 with @entity122 , grabbed his first from the penalty spot after @entity125 fouled @entity126 , firing powerfully past @entity127			0
@entity129 star @entity128 had a chance to level matters but he wasted a glorious chance , heading wide from a pinpoint @entity135 cross			0
and he would be made to pay for that miss as @entity115 doubled his account with a fierce volley into the roof of the net following a corner			0
@entity108 had opportunities in the second half as it pressed to get back in the game but @entity105 could have added to its tally on the counter attack			2
@entity105 , who are managed jointly by former @entity150 manager @entity149 ¤ ck and @entity151 , are now six points ahead of @entity108 , who are languishing in third			2
the other clashes in @entity156 saw the @entity157 triumph 4 - 2 in @entity158 while @entity117 and @entity159 drew 1 - 1 in @entity160			1
elsewhere , much - fancied @entity164 were held to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity163 striker @entity162 's opener canceled out by @entity168			1
that means @entity170 , led by @entity172 star @entity171 , now sit top after it held on with 10 - men to beat @entity175 2 - 1			1
@entity176 grabbed the first before @entity171 set up @entity178 for the second			0
@entity180 pulled one back for the visitors but @entity170 held on in the face of some heavy second half pressure after @entity185 was sent off			0
@entity170 has only ever qualified for one major tournament in its history , the @entity120 back in 1958			0
it faces @entity164 next .			0

@entity3 becomes youngest player in @entity13 qualifying
the 15 - year - old comes on as a substitute in @entity9 's 2 - 1 win over @entity10
@entity105 beat @entity108 2 - 0 to make it three wins out of three in qualifying
@entity164 and @entity166 draw 1 - 1 while there were wins for @entity95 , @entity170 and @entity93
