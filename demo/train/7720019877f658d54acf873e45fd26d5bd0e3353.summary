-- in the latest round of fighting between @entity4 and the @entity6 militants of @entity7 in @entity8 , one key player looms like an ominous , lengthening shadow : @entity10			1
never far from sight or mind , the standoff between @entity10 and the @entity12 over @entity10 's nuclear program serves as the backdrop to the fighting			1
it frames @entity4 tactics and strategy and influences the international diplomatic response			0
@entity10 and its nuclear program also play a powerful psychological role , as observers and participants ponder the parallels between the latest @entity4 - @entity7 conflict and a possible war in which @entity10 would stand against the @entity29 or @entity4 , and perhaps other @entity31 allies			1
cease - fire reached in @entity8 conflict little wonder then that @entity4 has received strong support from @entity29 president @entity36 -- who has repeatedly stated , " we are fully supportive of @entity4 's right to defend itself from missiles raining on people 's homes " -- as well as from nations including the @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , the @entity47 and others			1
when @entity4 see a rocket launched from @entity8 , the thought that one day that rocket could carry nuclear materials burns hot in their mind			0
opinion : @entity4 , engage @entity55 now and when they see their iron dome defensive missile shield -- the extraordinarily successful new technology -- shoot down a missile , it gives them , and perhaps @entity31 , a sense of reassurance about how a clash with @entity10 might unfold			2
@entity64 has long armed @entity4 's most determined enemies			1
@entity4 worry that @entity10 could hand nuclear materials to groups committed to @entity4 's destruction , a prospect many see as more realistic than a direct nuclear attack from @entity10			1
@entity4 's attacks in @entity8 are aimed at stopping the rockets and mortar attacks that have gone on for years and have intensified greatly in recent weeks			1
@entity4 complained to the @entity74 but @entity4 also wanted to deplete a @entity7 arsenal it sees as part of @entity10 's preparations in case of war with @entity4			1
@entity4 officials say the missiles launched by @entity7 and @entity82 into @entity4 's two largest cities , @entity84 and @entity85 , are @entity10 's rockets , which @entity4 believe were shipped by @entity10 in separate pieces like a doomsday @entity89 package			1
they were sent by sea to @entity91 and then moved through @entity92 and into tunnels to @entity8 , where they were assembled for firing at @entity4 with the help of @entity10 operatives on the ground in @entity8			2
@entity10 and @entity91 have denied that such a smuggling operation exists			0
@entity10 has threatened to unleash attacks against @entity4 and " wipe it off the face of the @entity101 , " in case of a hit on its nuclear installations			2
those attacks could come from @entity8 and from @entity10 's @entity107 ally , @entity108			2
perhaps not coincidentally , in late october @entity4 fighter jets are believed to have bombed an arms factory in @entity91			0
the @entity111 said the facility made missiles for @entity7 and was operated by @entity114			0
some analysts have speculated that the @entity4 attacks against @entity8 constitute the second part of the @entity91 operation , in which @entity4 set out to destroy @entity10 's most dangerous weapons arrayed in @entity8 just meters from @entity4 civilian populations and being launched with increasing brazenness by @entity7 and @entity82			1
opinion : how this could be the last @entity8 war the latest fighting brings to the forefront one of the pivotal questions posed by the revolutions that swept across the @entity129 @entity128 in the past two years : where would key @entity129 and @entity132 players stand in case of a confrontation between @entity10 and the @entity12 , particularly if @entity4 and the @entity6 became one of the epicenters of fighting ? @entity139 governments that defended @entity4 's right to fight back against rocket attacks also urged restraint , fearing an unraveling of a highly unstable @entity128 , where alliances are shifting and agendas are difficult to ascertain			1
one of the great uncertainties of the latest conflict has been how @entity129 countries where the political ground has shifted -- particularly @entity92 -- would react			0
so far , it appears that the rhetoric has changed somewhat			0
@entity129 leaders and their populations support the @entity6 , but they have other priorities at home			0
in case of a war with @entity10 , however , specifically one involving @entity4 , what would @entity156 , a @entity31 member but withering critic of @entity4 , do ? what could the @entity12 expect from @entity92 , with its president 's @entity164 ties ? what about @entity167 , a strong backer of @entity7 but an important @entity29 friend in the region ? the political transformations brought by the @entity129 uprisings also shattered some of @entity7 ' alliances , particularly the one with @entity176 president @entity175 , @entity10 's best friend and until recently @entity7 ' own warmly hospitable host			1
@entity178 provided @entity7 ' home away from home , the base of its exiled politburo leaders			0
when the carnage in @entity176 spun out of control , @entity7 broke with @entity175 and its leaders left , but the group maintained its links with @entity64			2
@entity7 prime minister @entity188 traveled to @entity10 earlier this year , reaffirming ties with the @entity190			2
and although @entity7 and @entity10 stand on opposite sides of @entity195 's @entity194 divide , they share fundamental goals			2
@entity64 's leaders unambiguously call for an end to @entity4			2
@entity7 has even more explicit goals on the issue			0
its charter , which has never been revoked or amended , opposes any negotiations with @entity4 and declares " @entity4 will exist ... until @entity195 will obliterate it			0
" the charter also quotes an ancient @entity82 scripture about the promise of redemption , saying it will come after " killing the @entity207			0
" while @entity7 leader @entity209 has made some conciliatory statements , suggesting a temporary accommodation with @entity4 might be possible , he has announced plans to retire , and hardliners led by @entity188 are gaining the upper hand in a power struggle within @entity7			0
it 's not much of a stretch to say @entity7 and @entity10 share the same objectives regarding @entity4 and the desirability of a future without it			1
opinion : @entity4 , face new reality the fighting between @entity4 and @entity8 falls tragically on the people who live there			0
but , like much that goes on in the @entity128 , it has much larger geopolitical implications , casting shadows across the world and buffeted by forces beyond the immediate site of the fighting			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity235 : in the latest @entity4 - @entity7 conflict , @entity10 is a key player
@entity239 : @entity10 's nuclear program serves as powerful psychological backdrop
she says @entity4 are worried since @entity64 has long armed @entity4 's enemies
@entity239 : the fighting has much larger geopolitical implications for the @entity128
