the @entity6 board 's decision is bound to be controversial ; then again , snubbing the @entity3 coverage would have been controversial , too			2
@entity5 , who has been living in @entity25 while seeking asylum from @entity10 prosecution , said in a statement that the @entity6 board 's recognition of the coverage was " vindication for everyone who believes that the public has a role in government			1
" " we owe it to the efforts of the brave reporters and their colleagues who kept working in the face of extraordinary intimidation , including the forced destruction of journalistic materials , the inappropriate use of terrorism laws , and so many other means of pressure to get them to stop what the world now recognizes was work of vital public importance			0
" while @entity5 provided a trove of documents , reporters including @entity57 , working for the @entity13 ; @entity58 , working for @entity59 ; and @entity60 , who worked with both , pored over the raw information , decided with their editors what parts were ethical to publish , and turned the information into stories that stunned readers around the world			0
on monday the staffs of @entity13 and @entity59 celebrated the prize , ten full months after the first @entity3 stories were published			0
" we 're extremely proud and gratified to have been honoured by the @entity6 board , " @entity72 , editor - in - chief of @entity73 , said in a statement published on the @entity77 - based news organization 's website			2
" it 's been an intense , exhaustive and sometimes chilling year working on this story and we 're grateful for the acknowledgment by our peers that the revelations made by @entity5 and the work by the journalists involved represent a high achievement in public service , " @entity79 added			1
@entity89 , editor of the @entity12 , told his newsroom that without @entity5 , " there would have been no public debate about the proper balance between privacy and national security			2
as even the president has acknowledged this is a conversation we need to have			0
