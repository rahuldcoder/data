until 1993 , @entity13 aircraft thundered down the runway of the military base on the island , but now ocean going birds nest and embark on their own epic cross-ocean journeys from the overgrown landing strip			0
yet the impact of humans and increasing consumer waste from thousands of miles away continues to have a direct effect on the island 's wildlife , as photographic artist @entity28 discovered when he traveled there in september			1
the @entity30 photographed the remains of albatross chicks that had died from consuming plastic waste found in the surrounding oceans			1
according to the artist , not a single piece of plastic in any of the photographs was moved , placed or altered in any way			0
the nesting babies had been fed the plastic by their parents , who collected what looked to them like food to bring back to their young			0
from cigarette lighters to bottle caps , the plastic is found in what is now known as the great @entity6 garbage patch that stretches across thousands of miles of the @entity6			2
@entity51 a diet of human trash , it is thought that every year tens of thousands of albatross chicks die on @entity1 from starvation , toxicity and choking			1
