@entity0 , @entity1 -- bent over amid the wreckage of her family 's home , @entity7 , 17 , leafs through the sodden remnants of her school yearbook , trying to see what memories she can salvage			1
her mother , @entity13 , picks among the jumble of debris where her kitchen used to be			2
the broken appliances strewn across the floor are the only indication that this was where she would cook for her five children			0
and they are some of the more fortunate ones			0
up and down the poor , remote @entity28 region on the southern @entity1 island of @entity30 , families like the @entity26 are trying to come to terms with what hit them			1
thousands of flimsy houses have been ripped to shreds			0
scores of people are dead			1
hundreds more are still missing , swept away in flash floods that roared down from the hills			0
in some places , mudcaked corpses line the streets , covered with cloths and palm leaves			0
distraught relatives wail and tug at one another 's clothes			0
rescuers struggle to aid @entity1 storm victims the merciless force that tore apart lives in the valley and elsewhere in eastern @entity30 was @entity55 , known locally as " @entity56 , " the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the island in decades			1
@entity59 , 48 , who lives in the town of @entity0 , said she had never experienced anything like it			1
she did n't hear the warnings to take refuge in evacuation centers			1
many of those who did failed to heed them			0
the area is sheltered from the worst of the weather by mountains , they figured			1
and besides , the big typhoons that slam into the @entity1 every year never come this far south , especially not this late in the year			1
and it brought savage winds that uprooted entire banana plantations in low - lying areas , and relentless rain that unleashed torrents of rocks and mud down the mountainsides where shanty - dwelling miners dig for gold			0
the epicenter of the devastation appears to have been in @entity87 , a town about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) southeast of @entity0 and close to the steep mountains			1
the flash floods hit it head - on tuesday , washing away families huddled in their homes and soldiers stationed in a compound in the town			2
large parts of @entity87 and many of the people who lived there are now buried under mud , fallen trees and rubble , said @entity102 , an emergency response program manager for @entity104 , a humanitarian group			1
" the mood is really gloomy , " he said thursday after visiting the town , where 90 % to 95 % of the houses are believed to have been destroyed or damaged			2
at least 142 people from @entity87 have died -- 110 of whom had n't been identified as of friday morning -- @entity1 authorities say			1
and with more than 340 others still unaccounted for in the town , the grim math of natural disasters suggests the death toll will rise further			2
residents who evaded death now lack food , shelter and , most of all , drinking water , since the nearest source is 5 kilometers away , according to @entity124			1
" they are just trying to survive , " he said , noting that the knee - deep mud in many places made it difficult to get around , with several areas of the town completely inaccessible			2
@entity1 president @entity131 will visit @entity87 on friday to assess the damage and oversee the distribution of relief goods , the official @entity130 reported			1
" i have @entity30 on my mind , especially the number of people missing , " @entity131 said thursday			2
" i am hoping these people will be found safe and sound			2
" the president said he is saddened that some families will spend the holidays in evacuation centers because their homes were destroyed			0
rescue workers have been struggling to reach many of the worst affected areas in @entity28 and the neighboring @entity147 region			0
landslides have blocked roads and knocked out power and communications			0
@entity55 raked across @entity30 and several other @entity1 islands before moving off into the @entity153			1
it has caused at least 418 deaths in the country , left about a quarter of a million homeless and affected more than 5 million people overall , the @entity154 , the @entity1 ' emergency management agency , reported friday morning			1
some 383 people are missing and 445 are injured , the agency said			2
the typhoon arrived just ahead of a sinister anniversary on @entity30			0
a year ago , @entity164 drenched northern areas of the island with heavy rain , setting off flash floods and landslides in the middle of the night that destroyed entire villages			0
@entity164 , dubbed " @entity164 " in the @entity1 , killed more than 1,200 people and left painful memories in the hardest hit areas , @entity176 and @entity177			1
the approach this week of @entity179 , a far more powerful storm than @entity164 , had residents fearing fresh devastation			2
local authorities took preemptive action , relocating thousands of people to evacuation centers and setting up emergency supplies			2
but in the end , northern @entity30 was spared the worst of @entity55 's fury			1
it was the less prepared communities of @entity28 and @entity147 , further south and east , that bore the brunt			0
an ethnically mixed area , the @entity28 was inhabited by a multitude of tribes until the 20th century , when a logging boom brought waves of migrants from further north in the @entity1			1
the timber trade , and later the mining industry , changed the geological and demographic landscape , stripping away the forests and driving many tribes into the hills			0
the valley is also known for its rich , fertile plain , where rice , corn , bananas and coconuts are grown			0
but on thursday , the headline of the @entity213 , a national newspaper , gave it a new , grim title : " valley of the dead			0
" if you are there , share your story @entity2 's @entity220 reported from @entity0 , and @entity221 reported and wrote from @entity222			0
@entity223 and @entity224 also contributed to this report .			0

at least 418 people have died as a result of @entity55 , @entity1 officials say
that *includes* 142 people in the town of @entity87 , the government reports
some residents in the remote area did n't hear warnings , others ignored them
survivors are in *desperate* need of water , food and shelter , a relief worker says
