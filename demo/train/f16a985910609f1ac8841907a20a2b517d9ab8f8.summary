a @entity1 zoo that made international headlines last month when it killed a healthy giraffe is once again in the news after it killed four lions to make way for a new male			1
the lions were killed monday , said @entity9 , a spokesman for the @entity10			1
two of those were young lions that were not old enough to survive by themselves and would have been killed by the new male lion if it had the chance , @entity9 told @entity18			1
he said the zoo had tried to place them elsewhere , " but unfortunately there was n't any interest			2
" the other two are the youngsters ' parents , described by the @entity10 as a " very old " breeding pair			2
the new male lion was brought from @entity27 , also in @entity1 , to form a breeding group with the @entity10 's two 18 - month - old females , born on site in 2012			1
the zoo had to put down the old lions and their young offspring " because of the natural structure and behavior " of the lion pride , the @entity10 said in a prepared statement			1
the newcomer is about 3 years old , large for his age and healthy , the zoo said			0
after he 's had a few days to adjust to his new surroundings , visitors will be able to see him			0
" he is a beautiful young male and i am certain he will be an impressive ambassador for his species , " zoo chief @entity44 is quoted as saying			1
he said the three young lions would " be the foundation of the zoo 's next lion era			1
" public anger the decision by the @entity10 to shoot dead its giraffe , named @entity54 , in february to prevent inbreeding sparked widespread outrage			1
the killing of four healthy lions has prompted further dismay			2
some questioned why the lions were n't sent elsewhere if the @entity10 no longer had space			2
" why are people visiting this abhorrent animal slaughter house , " said a message posted on a @entity65 page that calls for the closure of the zoo			0
the @entity70 -- a body governing 345 institutions -- said that the @entity10 had not broken its codes of conduct and that it " has been consistent in its approach to animal population management , and high standards of animal welfare			0
" the zoo supports natural cycles of reproduction and cub rearing , it said , and its lions are not part of a breeding program			0
" while @entity70 regrets the death of the animals in question , we recognize the right of @entity10 to humanely cull them in line with their policies , " it added			2
such culling is not uncommon , although large animals are less likely to meet that fate			0
@entity70 spokesman @entity98 told @entity18 that across the @entity100 zoos governed by the body , about 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed each year under programs to manage zoo populations			1
this includes " everything from tadpoles and insects up to charismatic megafauna like giraffes and lions , " he said , adding that it represents only 0.06 % of the zoos ' overall animal population			0
exact figures are hard to come by , but a few hundred of those killed by the zoos each year would be large animals , he said			2
@entity98 added that members of the public and animal rights groups tend to object only when zoos kill " cute , storybook animals , " rather than rodents or tadpoles			0
giraffe backlash @entity54 the giraffe was shot by a veterinarian and dismembered in front of an audience that included children , before being fed to the zoo 's lions , tigers and leopards			1
addressing criticism after that killing , @entity138 , the zoo 's scientific director , told @entity18 the decision was made for the greater good of the giraffe population			1
" our giraffes are part of an international breeding program , which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes , " he said			0
but the explanation did little to appease public anger			0
the backlash prompted another zoo in @entity1 to reverse course			0
@entity156 had said it was considering culling one of its male giraffes if a female was brought in to breed			0

zoo group says 3,000 to 5,000 zoo animals , from tadpoles to lions , are killed each year
@entity10 says it tried to move two of the four lions elsewhere , but " there was n't any interest "
three other lions will " be the foundation of the zoo 's next lion era , " says zoo chief
the same zoo prompted outrage when it killed a healthy male giraffe to prevent inbreeding
