-- if the furnace in your basement stopped working , and you hired a company to repair it , what would you do if several of the workers came upstairs , told you they could n't figure out how to get the furnace started , and then began pointing fingers at each other and saying : " it 's his fault			1
" " no , it 's his fault			0
" " if he 'd listen to me , we could get this job done			1
" " he tries to stop me every time i 'm on the verge of fixing your furnace			1
" you 'd probably stand there slack - jawed , hardly believing what you were witnessing			1
then you 'd say : " i do n't want to hear you guys blaming each other			1
i 'm paying you to do a job			0
just go back down there and do it , or if you ca n't , get out of my house			2
" or if you had a leak in your plumbing , and the plumbers emerged from under your sink to tell you : " i 'm sorry -- i ca n't work with this man			2
he undoes everything i 'm trying to do to get your pipes back in shape			0
" " so typical of him to put the blame on me			0
he 's got it exactly backward			0
i know how to stop the leak -- he has no idea			0
" you 'd tell them that this is not what you hired them to do			1
why are they wasting your time and money telling you that it 's the other guy 's fault that the water is still dripping onto your floor ? you 'd ask them to keep their personal animosities to themselves and figure out a way to complete the job they 'd agreed to do , or else you 're not going to give them a cent			2
you 'd be well within your rights			2
when work needs to be done , you hire people who promise that they know how to do it , and you expect to get what you paid for			1
you are the employer ; you are the boss			0
but in one area , this does n't seem to be the case			2
in politics and government , almost all @entity74 agree on the tasks that urgently need to be completed			1
a few of them : â € ¢ creating jobs so that finding meaningful employment can stop feeling like pursuing an all - but - unattainable luxury			2
â € ¢ a fair solution to health care , that compassionate people along every station of the right / left continuum can live with and be proud of			2
â € ¢ fixing the fallout from the big - bank machinations and the mortgage crisis that have cost so many people their homes			2
addressing these problems is a task beyond any of us as individuals			0
so , in the same way we hire workers to repair the furnace or plug the leak under the sink , we hire workers to fix the big national problems			1
they have lofty titles and work in buildings made of white marble			0
we hire our presidents , our members of @entity108 , and , indirectly , our justices of the @entity110			0
and maybe it is time to remind ourselves -- and to remind them -- that they are , in fact , hired hands			0
they are being paid to do a job			0
they are not being paid to tell their employers -- the citizens -- why they ca n't get the job done , or why they ca n't get along with the other hired hands who are supposed to be working beside them			1
only in politics and government , when the hired hands come up short , are they allowed to get away with flicking spitballs at each other as the country waits for results -- spitballs in the form of purportedly clever attack lines packaged and issued by advisers , meant to wound the other side , yet doing nothing to further the completion of the jobs at hand			1
@entity143 , individually , we are conservatives or liberals or somewhere in the middle , we have a right to expect the people who have been hired to solve the country 's problems to do just that , and to spare us the name - calling and blame - shifting			1
we would n't accept that from electricians or auto mechanics ; there is no reason to accept it from men and women with federal titles			0
there is a self - congratulatory phrase that political pros like to throw around : " politics ai n't beanbag			1
" but these days , that 's what it increasingly can feel like : a childish game played by people so enamored of the game itself that the playing of it pushes aside the real - world consequences			1
those real - world consequences matter -- they matter desperately			0
and the people who should be the demanding employers -- the citizens -- are tossed about in the heavy waves of the political storm , as if they are mere bystanders who have no standing in all of this			1
there is another phrase , used as the title of a song by the young @entity187 in the years before his name became known all over the world			0
in a different context from the issues we face now , @entity187 called his song " @entity194			0
" it would be hard to blame @entity74 today if they sometimes identify with that phrase			0
but they should n't have to settle for feeling like pawns			1
and this is not a game			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity204 : if you hired people to fix your furnace and they could n't agree , you 'd fire them
he says *similarly* , government *officials* , whose salaries we pay , must show results
he says only in politics can people get paid for fighting among themselves
@entity204 : citizens can be *forgiven* for feeling they are a pawn in politicians ' game
