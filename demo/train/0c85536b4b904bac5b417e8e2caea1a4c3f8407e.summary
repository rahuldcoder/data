-- @entity2 veterans know when a bad one 's coming			2
it 's like those who feel the barometric pressure drop of approaching storm systems in their bones			2
i got the vibe midweek			2
so i asked my friends on the @entity13 , hardy survivors of @entity15 , what advice they would share with those in @entity19 's path			1
but i did n't want the usual flashlight , batteries , water , generator , gasoline tips			1
tell them something they do n't know , i asked , something that helped get you through			1
here 's what they said : outdoor solar lights can be brought in at night to light the indoors			1
when you make a video of your home for insurance purposes beforehand , open drawers and closets so the contents are visible			2
have a tire plug repair kit and pliers to pull out nails or screws , since debris in the roadway causes flats and leaks that are tough to repair when everything is closed			1
extend your cell phone battery 's life by texting instead of calling and turning off @entity54 / @entity53 connections			1
bank safes and safe deposit boxes are not waterproof			2
during flooding , items left in them may be damaged and not accessible for weeks			2
have thick tarps and roofing tacks in case you lose shingles from the wind			0
what i did n't expect was the advice of a different nature that many added after their practical tips : faith and the knowledge that no matter what , your life and the life of your family is more important than any material possession you may have			1
keep a positive attitude and help your neighbor ! remember to have patience with your family , friends and neighbors			1
... work together and share your resources			1
some of the best relationships were made in the aftermath of @entity15 , as neighbors discovered new friends next door and grew closer helping one another through a trying time			1
keep a hurricane preparation checklist these are heartfelt suggestions from those who know what it 's like to lose everything all at once			1
disaster has a way of focusing the mind and leveling the playing field			1
doctors and bankers stood next to mechanics and janitors in food lines in my @entity13 hometown of @entity111 , @entity13 , in the weeks after @entity15			0
such brutal shocks to the system are inevitable			0
no one can stop them , though human beings prefer to imagine we are omnipotent			0
we have access to virtually anything with the click of a mouse or a tap on our smartphones			0
we can skype with someone on the other side of the world			0
we can land a rover on @entity128 and find proof of ancient rivers			0
we can do anything -- except control @entity132			0
we do n't like that , because it forces us to accept that we are vulnerable			1
@entity136 , states , cities and individuals wisely invest time and money on prevention efforts , but we ca n't really predict when , where and how the effects of nature at its worst will be felt			1
what we can control is our reaction			0
and researchers report that contrary to popular myth , during disasters most people do n't adopt an " every man for himself " attitude			1
most react with responsibility and concern for their neighbors			1
i have seen it myself , over decades covering blizzards , floods , hurricanes and more			0
nearly five years after @entity15 , i was present at a remarkable discussion between the mayor of @entity111 and his wife			0
most of the town 's homes and businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed in 2005 when the monster storm 's 30 - foot surge , sustained 125 mph winds and hopscotching tornadoes roared through			0
but the town and its people recovered			0
it really was , " said @entity177 of the spirit of kindness , generosity and selflessness that prevailed in the months after the hurricane			0
" it would be nice to reclaim some of that patience and understanding			0
i wish we could go back to it			0
" " i feel bad saying it , but i really miss it , " agreed his wife jan. " we were all so close			0
" times of disaster reveal not just our human fragility , but our strengths			1
it is at times like this that we learn what we are made of			2
people come together , share what they have and accept help from others			2
suddenly differences that once seemed insurmountable turn out to be quite insignificant			0
the worst of times can bring out the best			2
@entity2 safety : when the lights go out the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1
