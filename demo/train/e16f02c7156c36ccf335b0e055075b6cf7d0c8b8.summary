-- passengers might have been catching a catnap , reading a book or daydreaming as they gazed out the window into southern @entity5			2
they may have recently hopped on the train or boarded many hours ago as far back as @entity7			2
whatever their origin , wherever they were sitting , wherever they were going -- perhaps to the last stop of @entity10 -- these travelers would n't have expected the terror that @entity5 and @entity15 authorities detailed this week , a plot they alleged was backed by @entity17 elements half a world away			1
according to a @entity15 intelligence official and another government official , the plan was to plant explosives on a trestle -- a type of bridge over which trains often pass -- and detonate them after a northbound train crossed from the @entity15 into @entity5			1
specifically , another @entity15 official said , the @entity7 - to - @entity10 line that runs through @entity30 was targeted			1
once the explosives went off , two of the officials said , the train would have careered off its tracks , causing untold death and destruction			0
instead , the two men who @entity5 authorities say planned the alleged terror plot are behind bars			1
on tuesday , a day after the @entity42 announced the arrests , 35 - year - old @entity44 appeared in @entity45 in @entity10 , the city he calls home			1
asked whether he understood the legal proceeding , @entity44 said , " it 's very clear			2
" but his lawyer , @entity49 , afterward said that his client -- whom he described as a permanent resident in @entity5 , where he has lived the past 20 years -- is " in a state of shock and disbelief			1
" " he is anxious to see the evidence that the crown says that it has against him , " @entity49 said outside the courtroom			0
after waiving the reading of his charges , @entity44 returned to the @entity5 federal facility where he 's being held			1
bail was not considered tuesday in his case			0
his alleged co-conspirator -- 30 - year - old @entity63 , who was taken to @entity64 for a jurisdiction hearing so that a justice can decide whether he 'll be transferred to the province of @entity68 -- is expected to be in a @entity10 courtroom wednesday for a similar proceeding , said @entity49			2
according to court documents , both @entity44 and @entity73 face charges of conspiring " to murder persons unknown ... for the benefit of , at the direction of , or in association with a terrorist group			0
" suspects not citizens but have roots in @entity5 so who are these two suspects , and what were they doing ? authorities have not released much detail about the men , including their nationalities or how long they 'd been in @entity5 , beyond that they were n't @entity5 citizens			2
@entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 said that , since 2010 , @entity73 has been a doctoral student at the @entity92 at that school			0
he was conducting research on nanosensors , which are used primarily for medical treatments or to build other nanoproducts , such as computer chips , she said			0
" he seemed like a normal student , " said @entity89			0
authorities allege that @entity63 and @entity44 watched " trains and railways in the greater @entity106 " and intended to derail a passenger train , said @entity42 chief superintendent @entity107			2
" we are alleging these two individuals took steps and conducted activities to conduct a terrorist attack , " she said			0
muhammad @entity113 , a @entity114 community leader in @entity10 , told @entity0 that a tip from a local imam led to the investigation			0
@entity113 , president of the @entity114 social services organization @entity118 , cited the @entity5 police , which he said revealed the information during a briefing on monday with local @entity114 leaders			2
" we are supportive and thankful that the @entity42 did the investigation and was able to apprehend the individuals before anything happened , " @entity113 said			0
" we are pleased that they took us in and explained what was going on			0
" the @entity129 , quoting " highly placed sources , " reported that @entity63 and @entity44 had been under surveillance for more than a year			0
@entity132 spokesman @entity131 said tuesday that the @entity133 worked with its law enforcement counterparts in @entity5 , its close ally , during the investigation			1
the terror plot -- which a @entity42 official said on condition of anonymity was n't linked to last week 's deadly @entity143 bombings -- was in its planning stages and not imminent , @entity5 authorities said			1
still , the outlines are reminiscent of those found in a document seized during the raid in @entity149 that killed @entity150			0
this document indicated that @entity17 members discussed as early as 2010 a plan to derail trains in the @entity15 by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and in valleys , though no specific rail system was identified , a law enforcement official told @entity0 in late 2011			1
police allege ties to @entity17 in @entity162 authorities have said that they believe the suspects had help			1
@entity42 assistant commissioner @entity165 said the men got " support from @entity17 elements in @entity162 " to carry out an attack and conspire to murder people in greater @entity10			1
there 's no evidence that @entity162 's government was behind the plot , he added			0
" when i speak about ' supported , ' i mean direction and guidance , " @entity165 said			0
@entity162 denies that @entity17 has any presence within its borders			1
" @entity17 has no possibility to do any activity inside @entity162 or conduct any operation abroad from @entity162 's territory , and we reject strongly and categorically any connection to this story , " @entity162 's mission to the @entity180 said in a statement @entity17 and @entity162 have not been viewed as allies , with @entity17 's membership mostly @entity191 - dominated rather than @entity192 , the @entity114 sect of the vast majority of @entity162			1
" we have very little intelligence on @entity17 in @entity162 , " said @entity15 rep. @entity195 , chairman of the @entity132 counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee			1
what is known is that @entity150 's son - in - law @entity200 fled @entity201 and ended up in @entity162 after the fall of the @entity203 in 2001			2
according to @entity15 documents and officials , @entity200 landed in @entity162 along with other members of @entity150 's inner circle , including the group 's military commander , @entity210 , and @entity211 , a son of the @entity17 leader who has played a leadership role in the group			1
@entity211 also helped one of his father 's wives and several of his father 's children move from @entity149 to @entity162 , officials said			0
@entity200 , a @entity222 , was captured in @entity223 this year and is now in the @entity15 , where he 'll be charged in federal court with conspiring to kill @entity15 as part of @entity17			2
@entity150 confidant emerged as voice of @entity17 @entity0 's @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
