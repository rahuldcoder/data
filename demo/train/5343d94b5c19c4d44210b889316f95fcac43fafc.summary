@entity0 , @entity1 -- for years , @entity5 veteran @entity4 's motto has been " no man left behind			1
" this month , he 's broadened it to include women			1
in november , @entity4 was recognized at " @entity9 : an all - star tribute " as a @entity12 of 2009 for his efforts to help male veterans struggling with homelessness and addiction			1
his nonprofit , @entity18 , has provided food , housing , counseling , employment and medical services to more than 1,100 veterans			2
" i was somewhat overwhelmed at the tribute			0
to be a part of something that you love doing -- to be honored in doing it was , you know , strange , " recalled @entity4 , 54			1
" but then to be showcased internationally was tremendous			0
and it 's still reaping benefits today			2
" among those benefits is @entity4 's recent opening of the @entity36 and @entity37 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
the center and program widen the scope of support services his organization has been offering through its original @entity43			1
they also bring @entity4 's long - held dream to fruition			1
" twenty years ago , the dream was to be able to provide assistance and services for homeless veterans and their entire family , " he said			2
" we did come up with @entity43 10 years ago , but there was never that support for the family or the female veterans			1
this year , we 've been fortunate enough to complete that vision			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity9 the @entity36 assists veterans and their families through various periods of crises , including homelessness and addiction			1
before its addition , @entity4 and his team had to send veterans in need from one partner aid agency to another over multiple days , in multiple locations -- increasing the risk of losing clients back to the streets			1
at the new resource center , veterans in need are able to meet with any of @entity36 's 15 community aid partners under one roof in a single visit			1
they can receive assistance with housing , legal , medical care , employment , child care , education , pensions , food stamps and transportation needs			0
" we were looking to establish a place where we will not lose them in that process of ' hurry up and wait , ' " @entity4 said			1
" we want to centralize it			0
we want to get their needs addressed and ... get these service members back out into the community			0
that 's what it 's about			2
" @entity36 's housing program is geared toward female veterans and veterans with children			1
set adjacent to the organization 's original @entity108 for male veterans , the two new residence buildings can provide temporary housing for up to eight single female veterans and two small families			1
it is only the second transitional housing facility in the nation available to veterans with children , according to the @entity120 @entity119			2
" we 're trying to empower the family structure , because if the family struggles , the soldier struggles			0
when the soldier struggles , it puts everyone at risk , " @entity4 said			2
@entity129 is @entity36 's first female resident			0
an @entity131 veteran , @entity129 fell on hard times after losing her job last year			0
now , she and her daughters have a roof over their heads and the hope of better days to come			0
" my pride is restored , " said @entity129 , 40			0
" i 'm able to just go off to look for jobs and not worry about where am i going to go when i come home			0
it 's just so much relief			0
" the seed money for the new housing facility arrived shortly after @entity4 was announced as a @entity12			1
a local veteran and recovering addict who was touched by @entity4 's story approached him with a donation that covered the first year 's housing budget , about $ 44,000			1
the furnishings were donated by a local veterans ' motorcycle club			0
" believe it , there are people in @entity120 that do care , and we were blessed to come across these individuals , " @entity4 said			2
" and the thing that i appreciate the most is it is done for veterans by veterans			0
... we are going to leave no man , or woman or family behind			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity43 website and see how to help .			2
