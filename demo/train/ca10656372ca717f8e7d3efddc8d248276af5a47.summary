-- one day , a rather inconsiderate caveman turned to his cavewoman and said , " you know , @entity2 , you should really think about shaving your legs			2
" to which she replied , " shut up , @entity8			2
" having yet to successfully create fire or invent the wheel , caveman @entity8 was , all in all , sort of a lousy cave - husband			1
and , quite frankly , @entity2 was tired of being told what to do by a naked man who spent most of his time playing @entity17 in a cave with his friends			2
so she kept her legs just as they were			2
and nothing changed until around the 1940s			0
which was a considerably long time			0
@entity8 never got to see his dream come true			0
though he did finally ace the par - three eighth at @entity26			1
obviously , there 's no singular moment in history when @entity31 women decided to start shaving their legs , but it was around the time of @entity34 when it sort of became a popular practice in @entity36			0
and , consequently , it was about that same time when many @entity31 men collectively decided that the presence of female leg hair was pretty much the worst thing in the entire world			1
but it was a close second			0
of course , not every woman does it , not every woman should , and some women simply do n't even need to			1
nevertheless , the desire for smooth feminine legs spread throughout many places in the world			0
which is why one particular hairy legged image went insanely viral this week after it was posted on the @entity56 microblogging site @entity55			1
it was n't just that these legs were cartoonishly covered in such a forest of grizzly scruff that @entity62 ' arms sent them a formal letter of surrender			1
it was the suggestion that these may have actually been hairy stockings for women , designed with the purpose of scaring away drooly men with lurking eyes			1
the @entity56 trend - watching site @entity73 translated the picture 's caption as : @entity76 sexy , summertime anti-pervert full - leg - of - hair stockings , essential for all young girls going out			1
just like the other millions of people who saw this , i immediately searched all over the web for any site where the stockings might be sold , and came up with nothing			1
which was unfortunate , because , to the right buyer , they could make for a really funny bank robbery			0
" give me all the money ! " " tee hee			0
" of course , the real question is : are they real ? my gut ( and all seven of my functioning brain cells ) tells me no , but my heart wants to say yes			1
i simply need to believe that something this ridiculous might actually exist , for it confirms my longstanding suspicion that when it comes to good ideas , the world sort of topped out at the football phone			0
however , if you look closely at the image , the leg hair just seems far too natural to be synthetic			1
but , then again , there is a fairly defined cutoff at the ankle , which suggests that maybe -- just maybe -- these are truly some form of leggings			2
i still do n't think that 's what they are , but , for the sake of argument , let 's just assume we 're dealing with an actual product			1
thus , we have to ask : who would buy them ? well , as the @entity73 caption translation suggests , the supposed stockings are for any girl who wants to go out and not be bothered by ogling men			1
or , perhaps , they 're just for any girl who hopes to be courted by a gorilla			2
" hi , i 'm @entity130			0
can i buy you a banana ? " still , for those really wanting to avoid the low wandering eyes of dudes on the street , one has to wonder whether this is really a better solution than , say , pants			0
or a one - piece black leather @entity140 suit			2
ok , maybe not that last one			0
of course , many women simply do n't want to fully cover up during the summer heat			2
nevertheless , hairy leg stockings are still sort of an extreme measure			1
and , on top of that , you also dangerously risk attracting that super-creeper one who 's very particular and absolutely lives for this sort of thing			0
that 's probably the guy you want to avoid in the first place -- the hairy - leg - loving mouth breather who rides the bus all day			1
" @entity158 said i 'd meet a girl like you			0
" so , the online debate continues			0
@entity162 or fake ? useful or not ? either way , the ghost of caveman @entity8 is not impressed .			0

an image *claiming* to be " hairy leg " stockings appeared on a @entity56 blog
trend - watching site @entity73 suggests they 're designed to be anti-pervert
many do n't believe the stockings are real since they ca n't be found for purchase
