working there was a man who some knew as " @entity48			0
" he sported a bushy beard and ponytail			0
he may not have looked much like the man from that 2012 mugshot			0

5 things to know about fugitive hunter @entity26 " this family was destroyed , terrified that he would come back and hurt them , because they had the courage to come forward and file charges against him , " said @entity110 , co-founder of the @entity119			0
from @entity9 to @entity25 to @entity45 authorities searched in @entity9 , they looked in the @entity100 state of @entity9			1

a bloodhound picked up @entity7 's scent near @entity15 17 , which runs through @entity135			2
yet there was no sign of the man himself			0
as @entity14 from the @entity88 conceded , authorities did n't have much clue what happened			2

the last time he 'd been spotted -- up until this week -- he 'd had his black @entity162 , by the name of @entity164 , with him			0
