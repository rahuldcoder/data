-- @entity2 cricket legend @entity1 was again denied the chance to secure a record 100th international century on friday as @entity4 won the second test in @entity6 by an innings and 68 runs to take an unassailable 2 - 0 lead in the four - match series			1
@entity1 is international cricket 's record run scorer in both the five - day and limited overs formats but has been stranded on 99 centuries since march last year			1
the 38 - year - old batsman made 73 in the first innings of @entity17 's 122 - run defeat in @entity18 , and this time the " @entity1 " fell for 80 after being caught by @entity19 off the part - time bowling of @entity4 captain @entity21			1
having started the penultimate day on 112 - 4 , 354 runs behind @entity4 's 659 - 4 declared , the tourists were dismissed for 400 to end any hopes of a first series win on the continent			2
@entity21 's triple ton squeezes @entity17 it was another frustrating dismissal for @entity1 , who fell agonizingly short against the @entity29 in his home city @entity31 in november when he was out for 94			2
his last century came against @entity32 at the 50 - over @entity33 when he reached 111			2
@entity1 's wicket was all the more sweet for man of the match @entity21 , whose unbeaten 329 with the bat put @entity4 in control of the match			1
" it 's a very nice wicket to have , that 's for sure , " @entity21 told reporters			0
" to be able to get such a great player out is a very handy wicket , so i was stoked with that			0
" @entity1 's been such a great player for so long , everyone goes through that period			0
it 's nice that he 's not made his 100th hundred in this series , but there 's a long way to go			0
never write off great players			0
as a team we have the greatest respect for him			0
" resuming on eight , @entity1 quickly reached 50 off 89 balls -- including seven fours -- and went to the lunch break on 70 , before being caught at slip from @entity21 's gentle left - arm off - spin			1
opening batsman @entity61 earlier fell for 83 , while @entity62 added 103 with @entity1 before becoming the fifth man to depart for 66			2
@entity62 and captain @entity64 ( 2 ) both went to fast bowler @entity65 , who completed a five - wicket haul when he dismissed @entity67 for 62 to end the innings			2
" we have lost the chance of winning the series , but with two more test matches to go we can level the series so that 's what we 're looking to do , " said @entity64 , whose team made a disappointing 191 in the first innings			1
" it is a bit of a worry but the good thing is in the second innings we saw the batsmen score runs			0
what we have seen in the last couple of @entity73 matches is everybody has scored at least a 50 which gives us an indication that we need to convert those fifties into big innings and put runs on the board			0
" @entity65 ended the @entity6 match with figures of 8 - 157 , but @entity4 's celebrations were tempered by the news that promising young fast bowler @entity95 will miss the final two clashes of the series due to a foot injury			1
the 21 - year - old played a major role in @entity4 's victory , taking four wickets in the first innings and one in the second , and has an impressive haul of 25 wickets in his first four test matches			1
meanwhile , @entity32 clinched a long - awaited 2 - 1 series victory at home to @entity110 after winning the third test in @entity112 by 10 wickets on friday			1
the tourists reached 342 in their second innings after a battling 115 not out by @entity116 , which meant the @entity118 needed just two runs for victory			0
@entity110 resumed on day four at 138 - 4 with @entity116 on 19 , and raised hopes of setting a decent target as he took his partnership with @entity124 to 142			0
but @entity125 trapped all - rounder @entity124 leg before wicket for 63 , and the fast bowler then claimed his third wicket as young wicketkeeper @entity130 went for one			0
@entity131 and all - rounder @entity132 mopped up the tail to also finish with three wickets each as @entity32 won a series at home for the first time since 2008 .			1
