-- the leader of the @entity3 movement in @entity4 says that @entity6 regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the @entity9 and @entity10			1
in a televised address carried by @entity3 's station @entity14 , @entity11 said those regimes had lost the support and respect of their own people			1
@entity3 -- a @entity18 movement -- has often criticized the largely @entity20 - led governments in the @entity6 world			1
but @entity11 's language monday came close to promoting their overthrow			2
the @entity3 leader said he had not spoken before about the situation in @entity27 because he did not want to be accused of meddling in @entity27 's affairs			1
in a taunting reference to the @entity32 government 's claim that @entity3 has been active in @entity27 , @entity11 said the militia 's friends and supporters there had recommended it should not speak up about the situation			1
@entity11 's comments come as the people of @entity4 wait anxiously for the formation of a new government			1
the @entity41 led by @entity42 was brought down last month , and @entity3 has emerged as the most powerful force in a possible new government			2
at the same time , tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of @entity3 with the assassination of @entity50 , @entity42 's father , in 2005			1
@entity3 has turned on the @entity51 on @entity4 that is investigating the assassination , describing it as a tool of @entity10 and the @entity9			2
@entity42 says his party wo n't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal			0
positions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of @entity50 's death on february 14			1
the daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to @entity64 -- a billionaire @entity20 businessman involved in telecommunications , construction and other businesses			0
he has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate @entity20 , shi'ites and @entity70 in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between @entity4 's many parties			0
some @entity4 politicians , notably the veteran @entity75 , a @entity18 , are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within a week			0
others foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as @entity4 awaits the publication of the tribunal 's indictments , which for now are sealed			0
@entity4 's old divisions -- @entity70 against @entity20 against @entity18 -- are now more complex			0
some @entity70 families , notably the @entity84 and their @entity85 , are allied with the @entity87 's party and want to see @entity3 's wings clipped			2
besides its political strength , @entity3 's militia numbers thousands of well - trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with @entity10			2
but another prominent @entity70 , @entity94 , is allied with the @entity3			0
and @entity95 , the leader of the minority @entity97 community , has deserted @entity50 for the @entity99 @entity3 , even though @entity101 's father was killed by the @entity102			1
@entity94 was brutally honest about his choice : " we have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with @entity3			0
" in other words , the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize @entity4			0
many view @entity4 as an emerging battleground between @entity116 and @entity102 on the one hand and pro-western forces on the other .			0
