@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you grew up in @entity1 , chances are you played kabaddi as a child			1
@entity11 actor and now professional kabaddi league team owner , @entity9 says he did too			1
so when you talk about kabaddi , there 's a whiff of nostalgia associated with the sport			2
as children , we played kabaddi in the garden			0
you do n't need any equipment			0
we just drew two lines in the mud , that 's it			0
what you need is strength and stamina ... and you should be able to hold your breath for at least 30 seconds			0
what is kabaddi ? kabaddi is one of @entity1 's oldest indigenous sports			1
it 's basically a mix of school - yard tag and wrestling			1
you have two teams of seven players who stand on either side of a line			0
each team sends a " raider " across to the other side , one by one			0
the raider must tag as many opponents as he can and rush back to his side before the defenders catch him			0
sounds simple ? it is , though there is a twist : the raider must hold his breath the entire time he 's trying to tag someone and keep chanting " kabaddi , kabaddi , kabaddi " to prove he 's not taking another breath			1
" here is a sport which is a mixture of rugby , wrestling and it 's got the strategy of chess			2
it 's fantastic , " says @entity9			0
unfortunately , kabaddi faded away over the years			1
it was still played , but predominantly in rural areas			0
in urban @entity1 , it lost out to other sports like cricket and to a lesser extent , football , which are televised and so very easy to watch			1
" we have become this one sport nation , " says well - known @entity1 sports commentator @entity79			1
" it 's a bit of a monster			0
cricket has had a huge head start in terms of visibility on tv , which is a big deal in sport			2
most sports are only as popular as their live tv coverage , so that is what is required			1
" tv rebirth but now kabaddi is finally getting it			2
@entity79 has teamed up with @entity1 business tycoon @entity97 to launch @entity1 's first pro kabaddi league , based along the lines of @entity1 cricket 's successful @entity100 ( @entity100 )			1
there are eight franchises owned by corporate czars and @entity11 stars , and matches are played indoors on a large mat. in another huge boost for kabaddi , major broadcaster @entity108 decided to screen these matches live every night on prime time television			1
" the network felt the need to foster a multi-sport culture in @entity1 , " says @entity114 , ceo of @entity115			2
will audiences tune in to watch a sport that @entity1 has ignored for years ? it seems they 're intrigued			1
@entity108 says the inaugural game -- played in a stadium packed with celebrities , smoke machines and loud music -- was watched by 66 million viewers across the country			0
that 's 10 times higher than the @entity1 figures for the @entity133 opening match between @entity134 and @entity135			2
" everybody thinks of kabaddi as a very rural , basic , aggressive sport , you play on the grass or in the mud , but when you see international kabaddi today , its exhilarating , " says @entity9			0
@entity144 , one of @entity1 's most celebrated kabaddi players says he ca n't believe his sport is enjoying such a resurgence			1
" in my dreams i never thought i 'd see a day like this			0
