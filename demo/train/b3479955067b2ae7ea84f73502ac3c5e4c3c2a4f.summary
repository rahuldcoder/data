@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the week leading up to the meeting of world leaders in @entity6 , president @entity3 has been demonstrating a strong commitment to nuclear arms control			1
last week , he signed the first major agreement with the @entity10 since 2002 , which reduces the number of nuclear warheads and long - range missiles			1
@entity3 released the @entity15 , saying the @entity16 would not use nuclear weapons against countries that complied with the @entity19 , even if they attacked with conventional weapons			1
at the same time , the president said the countries that refused to abide by the treaty could be subject to nuclear reprisal			1
although @entity3 's @entity15 does not go nearly as far as many of his supporters were hoping , some @entity25 immediately attacked			1
sens. @entity28 and @entity29 warned that " we believe that preventing nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation should begin by directly confronting the two leading proliferators and supporters of terrorism , @entity35 and @entity36			2
the @entity3 administration 's policies , thus far , have failed to do that , and this failure has sent exactly the wrong message to other would - be proliferators and supporters of terrorism			1
" some democrats , constantly leery about appearing weak on national security , will buckle as the politics of nuclear weapons heats up when the treaty with the @entity10 reaches the @entity48 for ratification			1
but the administration should pursue this treaty aggressively and with confidence that they can win public opinion on this issue			2
the president must remind fellow @entity43 , as well as @entity25 , that historically the public has tended to strongly support nuclear weapons treaties , and the presidents who pursue them			1
after the @entity61 in october 1962 , president @entity60 proposed the @entity62			2
proponents of a ban on atmospheric and underwater testing of nuclear weapons had unsuccessfully pushed for some kind of ban since the early 1950s			1
there were many powerful opponents of a treaty , including the @entity72 , as well as the @entity25 right			2
in 1963 , they warned that a treaty would threaten @entity16 's military strength			0
but @entity60 was determined to obtain a treaty			0
he had seen the possibility of nuclear war firsthand when the @entity79 and the @entity16 went eye - to - eye over missiles in @entity82			1
@entity60 also worried the @entity83 were dangerously close to exploding their first nuclear bomb , something that also gave the @entity79 an incentive to work toward some kind of treaty			2
negotiations over a limited test ban took place from march to may			0
conservatives warned that verification would be impossible			0
on june 10 , in an effort to move the process forward , @entity60 made a dramatic speech at @entity98 in which he said , " i realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war -- and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears			2
but we have no more urgent task			0
" on august 5 , 1963 , the @entity16 , @entity108 and the @entity79 reached an agreement on the @entity62 that prohibited atmospheric , space and underwater testing			0
the administration remained nervous about whether @entity25 would be able to block its ratification			0
but by limiting the test ban rather than agreeing to a total moratorium , @entity60 undercut the opposition			0
the @entity48 ratified the treaty 80 - 19			0
polls showed that @entity16 overwhelmingly approved of the treaty			0
the following year , president @entity120 used sen. @entity122 's opposition to the treaty as a central theme in the fall presidential campaign			0
@entity43 broadcast a series of ads aimed at scaring the public about the possibility of nuclear war under a @entity122 presidency			1
polls consistently showed that @entity122 's position on nuclear weapons was his greatest weakness			1
hawkish @entity25 presidents have also discovered that nuclear arms reduction is popular with voters			1
in 1981 , @entity138 launched his presidency with an aggressive program that turned away from arms negotiations with the @entity79 and insisted on the toughest terms possible before negotiations could even begin			2
he staffed key positions with neoconservatives who opposed negotiations with the @entity79			0
the administration also vastly increased defense spending			0
but the public was scared , and @entity138 knew it			2
by 1983 , the atmosphere was tense			0
some called it the most dangerous period in the @entity155 since 1962			0
a series of international crises , including a standoff that followed the shooting down a @entity161 airliner by the @entity79 , caused @entity138 to see how easy it was for nuclear war to start			1
there was strong political pressure on the administration as well			2
the nuclear freeze movement , a massive international movement , was creating immense political pressure for @entity138 to reverse his agenda			2
on television , @entity16 were fearful when they watched the television special " @entity171 , " which focused on the effect of a fictional nuclear war on a small town in @entity176			1
one adviser warned @entity138 that " the issue in the general arena of foreign relations that could swamp us if we do not handle it with great care is the proposed freeze on the production and deployment of nuclear weapons			1
even when apprised of the difficulties of the verification of this plan , 75 percent of all @entity16 favor the freeze			0
" the @entity191 , under which @entity138 proposed to build a shield around the @entity16 to protect the nation from incoming missile attack , was partially a response to his critics to show the president wanted peace as well			0
@entity138 adopted a more conciliatory posture toward the @entity79 in 1984			0
he delivered a widely publicized speech arguing that the @entity79 and the @entity16 could achieve peace			0
then between 1985 and 1987 , he defied the right - wing of the @entity25 -- @entity202 called him a " useful idiot " for @entity208 propaganda -- and entered into negotiations with the @entity79 's @entity204 that culminated in the @entity205 in 1987			0
when national security is on the table , @entity43 tend to get nervous politically , particularly if they support a position that can be characterized as too dovish			1
but when it comes to nuclear weapons , president @entity3 is on a path that is politically sustainable			1
during the @entity155 , presidents from both parties learned that the @entity16 public tends to prefer politicians who are willing to take risks to reduce nuclear stockpiles rather than those who beat the drums of war			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

@entity3 shows strong commitment to nuclear arms control , says @entity226
he says other presidents have discovered controlling nuclear weapons is popular
some democrats may be leery of taking a position seen as too dovish , he says
@entity226 : public prefers politicians willing to take risks to prevent nuclear war
