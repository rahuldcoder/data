-- planetary nebula @entity1 has taken on romantic proportions			1
the @entity5 's @entity4 has captured a spectacular image of a planetary nebula aligned with a star in such a way that it looks like a diamond engagement ring			1
@entity1 33 came from a star that 's going to become a white dwarf , which is one way that a star can evolve at the end of its life			1
white dwarfs are small , dense and hot , and they cool down over billions of years			2
the star entering this last phase of its life blows off its atmosphere into space			2
this results in glowing gas clouds known as planetary nebulae , such as this one that looks like a round bubble or ring			2
in the image , the original star appears in the center of the blue bubble			0
it is more luminous than our sun , and its ultraviolet radiation gives a glow to the ring of atmosphere that has been cast out			0
scientists are not yet sure if it 's actually a double star or just a chance alignment in the image			0
it 's not common for a planetary nebula to be as perfectly round as this one			1
the symmetry of a planetary nebula is usually disturbed -- for example , by the way its star spins or if there are multiple stars in the system			1
as for the " diamond " in this image , it 's a different star called @entity62 , which happened to align with the nebula in this image			0
@entity1 is about 2,500 light - years away , so no one will be coming near it anytime soon			1
it 's as if the universe liked the star and put a ring on it			0
astronomers find first asteroid with rings dwarf planet discovered at solar system 's edge follow @entity79 on @entity80 at @ lizlandau			0

planetary nebula @entity1 is 2,500 light - years away
it comes from a star that will become a white dwarf
the star is throwing out its atmosphere , *forming* the bubble
