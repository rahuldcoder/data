-- @entity3 security forces in last friday 's bloody demonstrations blocked wounded protesters from getting medical care , a humanitarian watchdog said on tuesday , citing witness accounts			1
the developments occurred in the @entity3 cities of @entity11 and @entity12 , where many casualties occurred as protesters clashed with security forces , @entity8 said			1
security forces " stopped medical personnel and others from reaching wounded protesters " and " prevented injured protesters from accessing hospitals , " the group said			1
" to deprive wounded people of critical and perhaps life - saving medical treatment is both inhumane and illegal , " said @entity22 , @entity8 @entity23 director			1
" barring people from needed medical care causes grave suffering and perhaps irreparable harm			2
" one witness in @entity11 , in the south near @entity32 , said " the security forces did not allow the ambulances to approach the road to pick up the wounded , and kept shooting when other protesters tried to carry the wounded away			1
" another witness said he saw three people struck by bullets and carried into the @entity42 mosque , where he saw about 10 wounded protesters , " three of whom died from their wounds while he was still in the mosque			2
" " people were lying on the floor ( of the @entity42 mosque ) , all over the place , and there were a couple of doctors and nurses , and also local women struggling to help the injured			2
but they could not do much -- they only had the basic supplies brought from the local pharmacies ; the hospitals were blocked by the security forces and it was impossible to bring the necessary equipment or supplies into the mosque			2
several people with serious injuries were dying , and there was nothing we could do to help them , " the witness said			2
in @entity12 , near @entity72 , witnesses gave accounts of security forces " firing on protesters seeking to help the wounded			1
" two doctors who treated the wounded told @entity8 " that it was impossible to bring the injured into the hospital because it was surrounded by the security forces			1
" " i was in the hospital in the afternoon , when i started getting calls from people asking for help			2
i knew people could not bring the wounded in -- the hospital was surrounded by the security personnel			0
we also could n't send an ambulance , fearing the security forces would open fire , as happened in other places , " one of the doctors said			0
" i rushed out and went to private homes where the rescuers brought the wounded			0
i could not take any major supplies or tools ; only the most basic things			0
the injuries were serious and we had nothing to work with -- in one case , we had to probe a wound with a metal spoon to see how deep the bullet went			1
" the family of an injured protester tried to get treatment for the victim at a military hospital , but were rebuffed because civilians could n't get treatment there			0
security at a civilian hospital said only service members and not wounded civilians could get treatment			0
protests started in @entity3 more than three weeks ago , erupting in @entity11 and then spreading to other cities			1
the @entity3 government , which says it is working to respond to citizen grievances , blames foreigners and instigators for infiltrating peaceful demonstrations and feeding violent confrontations			0
but @entity3 activists say government forces are violently suppressing their peaceful demonstrations , using tear gas and live fire against unarmed civilians , raiding homes , and making dozens of arrests			0
the violence has alarmed the international community			0
the @entity137 on tuesday is now advising " against all but essential travel " to @entity3 as a result of the country 's " deteriorating security situation			0
" @entity3 's leaders talk about political reform , but they meet their people 's legitimate demands for reform with bullets , " said @entity22			0
" they accuse the protesters of inciting divisions in @entity3 's society , but the violence of their security forces is what is harming @entity3 the most			0
" the @entity154 in @entity3 , an activist group , said there were 37 demonstrators killed across the country on friday , including 30 in @entity11 province , four in @entity72 province and three in @entity161 province			1
@entity8 said it " confirmed that at least 28 people were killed " in protests on friday -- 27 in @entity11 and one in @entity165			1
it said it could n't get " reliable information " about casualties during protests in other towns			0
@entity3 said 19 security forces were killed in @entity11 on friday and dozens of others were injured in violence caused by " armed groups " firing at citizens and " unarmed security forces			1
