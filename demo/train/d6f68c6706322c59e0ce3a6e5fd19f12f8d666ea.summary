" the first step to a stronger @entity6 is to repeal @entity16 because it represents the worst of both worlds , " @entity2 said to loud booing			0
he added : " i had a feeling there 'd be mixed reaction so let me get into it			0
" " it weakens @entity6 for today 's seniors and puts it at risk for the next generation , " @entity2 said , repeating the factually challenged claim of $ 716 billion in @entity6 cuts and also targeting a panel created under the health care law charged with recommending ways to reach targeted savings starting in 2014			0
@entity2 also took a swipe at @entity1 's re-election slogan of " forward , " saying it means " forward into a future where seniors are denied the care they earned because a bureaucrat decided it was n't worth the money			1
" in his remarks , @entity1 argued that @entity6 savings come from " using the purchasing power of @entity6 to say to doctors and hospitals and insurance companies : ' you guys need to work smarter			0
" " instead of having five different tests that each of you is charging for , do one test and email it to everybody , " he said to applause			0

" they know that a voucher program is not going to be a good deal , " @entity1 said			0

tough stretch for @entity38 @entity38 is coming off a tough stretch in the weeks before the three presidential debates in october			2
last week , the @entity38 campaign struggled in its initial response to anti-american violence in @entity277 and @entity278			0
then a left - leaning magazine released secretly recorded clips of @entity38 speaking at a may fund - raiser in which he said 47 % of @entity83 depended on government help , saw themselves as victims and wo n't support him			2
under criticism for the comments at the fund - raiser , @entity38 stuck by them and rallied some conservative commentators to his side by emphasizing his message on his allegation that @entity1 's polices increased public dependency on government			1
@entity294 on the ' 47 percent ' comments and the debates in particular , they accused @entity1 of favoring wealth redistribution -- code for socialism among conservatives -- based on the 1998 video of the president when he was a state senator in @entity304			2
" i think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution -- because i actually believe in some redistribution , at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody 's got a shot , " @entity1 says in the clip , posted tuesday on the conservative @entity307 website			0
the @entity317 on wednesday characterized the @entity3 attacks over the redistribution comment as an effort to divert attention from @entity38 's remarks at the may fundraiser			0

house speaker @entity329 continued the @entity38 attack line on friday , saying @entity1 and congressional @entity66 lacked the leadership qualities necessary to change the culture of partisan divide and legislative gridlock			1

" @entity16 owes a debt to what was done in @entity362 by my opponent , mr. @entity38 , even though sometimes he denies it , " the president said in a jab at his challenger , who passed a similar plan while governor of the state but now vows to repeal the federal version			2
" the one thing i wo n't do though is go along with bad ideas that are not helping the middle class , " @entity1 said to applause , adding : " if i hear the only way @entity3 in @entity367 are willing to move forward is to voucherize @entity6 , i 'll say no. " polls : @entity3 @entity373 takeover might be tougher @entity0 's @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 and @entity378 contributed to this report .			1
