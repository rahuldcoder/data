@entity0 -- president @entity3 's record on foreign policy has changed dramatically since taking office -- he now has one			1
what was arguably candidate @entity3 's biggest weakness in 2008 may become president @entity3 's biggest strength with the announcement of an interim deal with @entity11 to slow that country 's nuclear program			1
since taking office in 2009 , the president can boast successes including ending the war in @entity18 , winding down the war in @entity20 and killing @entity22 leader @entity21			0
but unlike the other events , the @entity11 deal brings a tremendous amount of risk that could yield high reward or total catastrophe : it could end in either a more peaceful world or a nuclear @entity11			1
state of play the president has had a rough go of it in the past two months , largely due to the disastrous rollout of @entity36			0
the latest @entity1 / @entity38 poll , which was released last week , has his approval rating at 41 % -- the lowest of his presidency			0
however , the same poll found that 56 % of @entity42 said they would favor the kind of interim deal with @entity11 that was reached saturday			1
20 questions about the @entity11 nuclear deal : what it says , what 's at stake , what 's next @entity53 strategist @entity52 said on @entity1 's @entity54 sunday that the deal could help the president 's public perception			1
" any time you see the president on the world stage , captain of the ship of state , you see him as the father figure for the country , " @entity52 said			0
" that 's a good thing for the president politically			2
" domestic impact but that picture could get clouded if he does n't have the support of @entity74			2
lawmakers from both parties urge caution on @entity11 deal the deal between @entity11 and the six negotiating nations -- the @entity80 , the @entity42 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 -- has been met with staunch opposition , even from members of @entity3 's own party			1
sen. @entity88 , @entity90 - @entity89 , an important @entity92 voice on @entity11 , said the deal disproportionately favors the @entity95 republic , and he predicted bipartisan support in @entity74 for new sanctions			1
" this disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that @entity92 and @entity53 will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in december			0
i intend to discuss that possibility with my colleagues , " the senator from @entity89 said			0
and on @entity106 , rep. @entity105 , @entity90 - @entity89 , said the deal makes it " very difficult " to continue sanctions that are considered effective at hobbling @entity11 's nuclear capabilities			1
@entity74 could choose to try to circumvent the deal and impose new sanctions on @entity11 , starting another battle between the president and the @entity74			1
such an action would be a huge embarrassment for @entity3 internationally if @entity74 successfully undermines him			2
" weakness invites the wolves , " @entity52 said			0
" when you are in a weak position politically as leader of the @entity42 ... you 're a little more open to things you should n't be open to			0
" with trust between the executive and legislative branches extremely low , the @entity11 deal could drive a bigger wedge between the two sides			1
international impact also at stake is the @entity42 ' relationship with its allies in the @entity131			0
on sunday , @entity132 and @entity133 slammed the deal , with @entity132 prime minister @entity135 calling it a " historic mistake			0
" @entity11 nuclear deal : one agreement , wildly different reactions " they 're afraid this deal is the start between the @entity42 and @entity11 that will take us off @entity133 's side and put us on @entity11 's side , " @entity141 of the @entity142 said on @entity1 's @entity143			1
while allies worry that the deal might weaken their relationship with the @entity42 or put their security at risk , @entity1 's @entity150 said the alternative could be worse			2
" had the @entity160 talks broken down this week , @entity11 would have continued to expand its nuclear program , " he said , adding that @entity11 has increased the number of centrifuges from 160 to 19,000 in the past decade			0
@entity83 and @entity82 , two countries that have tenuous relationships with the @entity42 and have closer ties to @entity11 , support the deal			2
retreat or redefine ? while he has received bipartisan praise for some of his foreign policy initiatives , @entity3 has been criticized by opponents for acquiescing @entity42 leadership			1
@entity52 said some might look at this deal as another example of the president " retreating from the world			0
" " it 's our presence and strength that keeps the world peaceful , " he said			0
" as we approach a more global kind of perspective , we 're just one of many countries that is working to make the world a better place , the world is more uncertain			0
" his supporters , however , have praised his foreign policy philosophy			2
@entity184 , a former adviser and deputy press secretary for @entity3 , said the deal shows " a significant shift in @entity42 foreign policy " that includes consensus - building and diplomatic engagement			1
while the interim deal is only the first stage of multistep negotiations that could unravel at any time , only time will tell how it will be remembered by future historians examining @entity3 's legacy			1
breaking down the @entity11 nuclear deal			2

president @entity3 has *struggled* politically recently
on interim @entity11 deal , the public could be on his side
@entity74 , however , has indicated that it is *skeptical*
his foreign policy legacy could be defined by deal 's outcome
