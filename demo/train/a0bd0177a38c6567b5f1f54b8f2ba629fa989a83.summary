the @entity0 has become too big and too powerful			1
what was supposed to be a single agency with a dual mission -- protecting the security of @entity6 communications and eavesdropping on the communications of our enemies -- has become unbalanced in the @entity11 , all - terrorism - all - the - time era			1
putting the @entity16 , the military 's cyberwar wing , in the same location and under the same commander , expanded the @entity0 's power			2
the result is an agency that prioritizes intelligence gathering over security , and that 's increasingly putting us all at risk			1
it 's time we thought about breaking up the @entity0			1
broadly speaking , three types of @entity0 surveillance programs were exposed by the documents released by @entity29			2
and while the media tends to lump them together , understanding their differences is critical to understanding how to divide up the @entity0 's missions			2
the first is targeted surveillance			0
this is best illustrated by the work of the @entity0 's @entity38 ( @entity38 ) group , including its catalog of hardware and software " implants " designed to be surreptitiously installed onto the enemy 's computers			2
this sort of thing represents the best of the @entity0 and is exactly what we want it to do			0
that the @entity6 has these capabilities , as scary as they might be , is cause for gratification			0
the second is bulk surveillance , the @entity0 's collection of everything it can obtain on every communications channel to which it can get access			1
this includes things such as the @entity0 's bulk collection of call records , location data , e-mail messages and text messages			1
this is where the @entity0 overreaches : collecting data on innocent @entity6 either incidentally or deliberately , and data on foreign citizens indiscriminately			1
it does n't make us any safer , and it is liable to be abused			0
even the director of national intelligence , @entity77 , acknowledged that the collection and storage of data was kept a secret for too long			1
the third is the deliberate sabotaging of security			0
the primary example we have of this is the @entity0 's @entity88 program , which tries to " insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems , it systems , networks and endpoint communication devices			2
" this is the worst of the @entity0 's excesses , because it destroys our trust in the @entity97 , weakens the security all of us rely on and makes us more vulnerable to attackers worldwide			1
that 's the three : good , bad , very bad			0
reorganizing the @entity6 intelligence apparatus so it concentrates on our enemies requires breaking up the @entity0 along those functions			1
first , @entity38 and its targeted surveillance mission should be moved under the control of @entity16 , and @entity16 should be completely separated from the @entity0			1
actively attacking enemy networks is an offensive military operation , and should be part of an offensive military unit			0
whatever rules of engagement @entity16 operates under should apply equally to active operations such as sabotaging the @entity113 nuclear enrichment facility in @entity114 and hacking a @entity116 telephone company			0
if we 're going to attack the infrastructure of a foreign nation , let it be a clear military operation			0
second , all surveillance of @entity6 should be moved to the @entity122			1
the @entity122 is charged with counterterrorism in the @entity6 , and it needs to play that role			1
any operations focused against @entity6 citizens need to be subject to @entity6 law , and the @entity122 is the best place to apply that law			1
that the @entity0 can , in the view of many , do an end - run around congressional oversight , legal due process and domestic laws is an affront to our @entity136 and a danger to our society			0
the @entity0 's mission should be focused outside the @entity6 -- for real , not just for show			1
and third , the remainder of the @entity0 needs to be rebalanced so @entity143 ( communications security ) has priority over @entity146 ( signals intelligence )			2
instead of working to deliberately weaken security for everyone , the @entity0 should work to improve security for everyone			1
computer and network security is hard , and we need the @entity0 's expertise to secure our social networks , business systems , computers , phones and critical infrastructure			2
just recall the recent incidents of hacked accounts -- from @entity163 to @entity164			0
what once seemed occasional now seems routine			0
any @entity0 work to secure our networks and infrastructure can be done openly -- no secrecy required			0
this is a radical solution , but the @entity0 's many harms require radical thinking			2
it 's not far off from what the president 's @entity174 on @entity176 , charged with evaluating the @entity0 's current programs , recommended			0
its 24th recommendation was to put the @entity0 and @entity16 under different generals , and the 29th recommendation was to put encryption ahead of exploitation			0
i have no illusions that anything like this will happen anytime soon , but it might be the only way to tame the enormous beast that the @entity0 has become .			0

director of national intelligence said @entity6 should have acknowledged surveillance
@entity194 : @entity0 is too big and powerful ; it 's time to break up the agency
he says all bulk surveillance of @entity6 should be moved to the @entity122
@entity194 : instead of working to weaken security , @entity0 should try to improve security for all
