an @entity1 correspondent who has been held for nearly a month by @entity3 authorities calls his detention an attack on press freedoms , according to a letter posted online saturday by the news network			1
@entity9 , an @entity10 , is one of three @entity1 employees who have been held since december 30 by @entity3 authorities , who have accused the three for allegedly meeting with members of the banned @entity14			1
" how do you accurately and fairly report on @entity3 's ongoing political struggle without talking to everyone involved , " he wrote			1
the network did not say how it obtained the letter from @entity9 , who has previously worked for @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
he is being held along with producers @entity23 and @entity25			1
@entity27 leaders , human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly called on @entity3 to release the men , saying their arrests were a violation of human rights and press freedoms			1
@entity23 worked for @entity20 and the @entity35 prior to joined the @entity37 - based network			1
@entity25 is a @entity38 - based producer for the network			1
international media demand @entity3 release detained journalists text of the letter , entitled " a letter from @entity46 , " released by @entity1 : i am nervous as i write this			1
i am in my cold prison cell after my first official exercise session -- four glorious hours in the grass yard behind our block and i do n't want that right to be snatched away			0
i 've been locked in my cell 24 hours a day for the past 10 days , allowed out only for visits to the prosecutor for questioning , so the chance for a walk in the weak winter sunshine is precious			0
so too are the books on history , @entity64 and fiction that my neighbours have passed to me , and the pad and pen i now write with			0
i want to cling to these tiny joys and avoid anything that might move the prison authorities to punitively withdraw them			2
i want to protect them almost as much as i want my freedom back			0
that is why i have sought , until now , to fight my imprisonment quietly from within , to make the authorities understand that this is all a terrible mistake , that i 've been caught in the middle of a political struggle that is not my own			1
but after two weeks in prison it is now clear that this is a dangerous decision			0
it validates an attack not just on me and my two colleagues but on freedom of speech across @entity3			1
all of a sudden , my books seem rather petty			0
i had been in @entity38 only two weeks before interior ministry agents burst through the door of my hotel room , that of my colleague and producer @entity23 , and into the home of @entity1 's second producer @entity25			1
accuracy , fairness , and balance we had been doing exactly as any responsible , professional journalist would -- recording and trying to make sense of the unfolding events with all the accuracy , fairness and balance that our imperfect trade demands			2
most of the time , it is not a difficult path to walk			0
but when the @entity3 government declared the @entity14 to be " terrorist organisation " , it knocked the middle ground out of the discourse			1
when the other side , political or otherwise , is a " terrorist " , there is no neutral way			2
as @entity118 loved to point out after 9/11 , you are either with the government or with the terrorists			0
so , even talking to them becomes an act of treason , let alone broadcasting their news however benign			0
the following day , the government fleshed out its definition of the term			0
anyone caught handing out @entity14 leaflets , or simply participating in protest marches against the government could be arrested and imprisoned for " spreading terrorist ideology "			1
the @entity14 has lost much of the support and credibility once had when its political leader @entity133 became @entity3 's first democratically elected president just over a year and a half ago			1
and many here hold it responsible for a growing wave of islamist violence , but it remains the single largest and best organised social and political force in @entity3			1
what then for a journalist striving for " balance , fairness and accuracy ? " how do you accurately and fairly report on @entity3 's ongoing political struggle without talking to everyone involved ? i worried about this at the time with @entity23 , but we decided that the choice was obvious -- as obvious as the price we are now paying for making it			1
the three of us have been accused of collaborating with a terrorist organisation [ the @entity14 ] , of hosting @entity14 meetings in our hotel rooms , of using unlicensed equipments to deliberately broadcast false information to further their aims and defame and discredit the @entity3 state			1
the state has presented no evidence to support the allegations , and we have not been formally charged with any crime			0
but the prosecutor general has just extended our initial 15 - day detention by another 15 days to give investigators more time to find something			2
he can do this indefinitely -- one of my prison mates has been behind bars for 6 months without a single charge			0
' the prisons are overflowing ' i am in @entity46 -- a sprawling complex in the south of the city where the authorities routinely violate legally enshrined prisoners ' rights , denying visits from lawyers , keeping cells locked for 20 hours a day ( and 24 hours on public holidays ) and so on			2
but even that is relatively benign compared to the conditions my colleagues are being held in			0
@entity23 and @entity25 have been accused of being @entity14 members , so they are being held in the far more draconian " @entity193 " built for convicted terrorists			1
@entity23 has been denied the hospital treatment he badly needs for a shoulder injury he sustained shortly before our arrest			2
both men spend 24 hours a day in their mosquito - infested cells , sleeping on the floor with no books or writing materials to break the soul - destroying tedium			2
remember we have not been formally charged , much less convicted of any crime			0
but this is not just about three @entity1 journalists			2
our arrest and continued detention sends a clear and unequivocal message to all journalists covering @entity3 , both foreign and local			2
the state will not tolerate hearing from the @entity14 or any other critical voices			2
the prisons are overflowing with anyone who opposes or challenges the government			0
secular activists are sentenced to three years with hard labour for violating protest laws after declining an invitation to openly support the government ; campaigners putting up " no " banners ahead of the constitutional referendum are summarily detained			0
anyone , in short , who refuses to applaud the institution			0
so our arrest is not a mistake , and as a journalist this is my battle			0
i can no longer pretend it 'll go away by keeping quiet and crossing my fingers			0
i have no particular fight with the @entity3 government , just as i have no interest in supporting the @entity14 or any other group here			1
but as a journalist i am committed to defending a fundamental freedom of the press that no one in my profession can credibly work without			0
one that is deemed vital to the proper functioning of any open democracy , including @entity3 's with its new constitution			1
of course we will continue to fight this from inside prison and through the judicial system here			0
but our freedom , and more importantly the @entity244 here , will not come without loud sustained pressure from human rights and civil society groups , individuals and governments who understand that @entity3 stability depends as much as on its ability to hold open honest conversations among its people and the world , as it does on its ability to crush violence			2
we know it is already happening , and all of us are both moved and strengthened by the extraordinary support we have already had , but it needs to continue			0
