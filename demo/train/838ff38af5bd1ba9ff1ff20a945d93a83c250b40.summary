@entity0 , @entity1 -- i cut my teeth reporting from @entity0 during the early days of the " troubles " in @entity1			1
one thing i remember was the fear -- the fear of the @entity9 that the @entity11 people felt , and the fear felt by the @entity14 soldiers who came under regular attack by the @entity16 and stone - throwing youths			1
another thing i remember was the complete absence of any trust in the government among the mainly @entity23 community			2
@entity24 destroyed all hope that it would be restored anytime soon			1
on that day , january 30 , 1972 , 14 people were shot dead by @entity14 paratroopers			1
everyone knew they were unarmed demonstrators protesting against internment without trial of @entity16 suspects			0
but the former head of the @entity9 , gen. @entity34 , drew up a " shot report " claiming that those hit , mostly teenagers , were gunmen or bombers			1
then @entity45 chief justice @entity44 , after an inquiry in which he ignored the evidence of eyewitnesses , cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing and accused the innocent victims of illegal activities			2
the outrage was felt across the whole of @entity52 and fueled the @entity16 campaign of attacks on @entity14 targets			2
@entity24 became a defining moment in the fraught history of @entity14 - @entity11 relations			1
i returned to @entity0 tuesday for the result of the @entity69 inquiry , a new investigation ordered by the @entity14 government as part of the peace process , which has already given @entity1 a power - sharing government and the disbandment of paramilitary forces			1
the atmosphere in the hours before the findings were officially disclosed by @entity14 prime minister @entity72 was emotional and optimistic			2
thousands gathered in @entity74 in sunshine as relatives of the victims were given an advance look at the report under strict orders to respect a 3:30 p.m. embargo			0
but four minutes before the deadline , a hand appeared from an aperture in the second - floor stained - glass windows of the century - old building			0
it was a thumbs - up			0
other hands appeared , waving excitedly , as the crowd cheered and cried			0
thus did the people of @entity0 learn that the slur on the mostly young victims and their families had been removed at last			0
it was not just a vindication of the relatives , who campaigned for 38 years for justice			0
@entity98 , former commander of the @entity16 and now co-leader of the power - sharing government , told me he felt it was " a moment of liberation for all of us			2
" as i watched men in their 60s who had marched that day shedding tears of joy , i felt that i was experiencing a moment of closure in the history of the @entity112			0
a great historical injustice was corrected			1
it was as if @entity24 and the @entity14 prime minister 's apology were bookends to the press 's reporting of the @entity112 -- a feeling reinforced by the return of many correspondents from around the world who reported from @entity0 that day , like @entity124 , formerly of the @entity125 , to witness the event			1
@entity72 accepted that @entity14 soldiers were responsible for " unjustified and unjustifiable " deeds and said that the report exonerated the victims of any wrongdoing			1
in how many countries in the world would this happen ? it is the outcome and climax of a drawing together of the @entity14 and @entity11 governments in the last 20 years to find a joint solution to what seemed to me and everyone else in those dark days of the 1970s to be an insoluble problem			1
the inquiry sat for 434 days and took testimony from 921 witnesses : 505 civilians , 245 soldiers , 33 police officers , nine forensic experts , 34 @entity16 members , 39 politicians , civil servants and intelligence officers , 49 journalists and seven priests			0
many complained it was too lengthy and expensive			0
but if @entity157 had not whitewashed the paratroopers back then , it would never have been necessary			0
relations between the two islands are now at their best in history			0
the spirit of reconciliation has triumphed -- in @entity1 , and in relations between @entity166 and @entity167 , which were ripped asunder by @entity24 and took so many years to repair			1
there is a lesson here for the whole world			0
lies and coverup make problems worse			1
the truth can mend fences			1
the families showed that in their first statement after the report			0
their spokeswoman , @entity180 -- sister of @entity181 , age 17 , the first to be killed that day -- called on the thousands in the square for a minute 's silence for all the victims of the violence of the past 40 years			0
it was a gesture that will not go unnoticed by the victims of the @entity16 in @entity1 's @entity190 community			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

on " @entity24 " in 1972 , 14 protesters shot dead by @entity14 soldiers in @entity1
thirty - eight years later , @entity14 government finds that shootings were unjustified
@entity193 says the @entity69 report corrected a " great historical injustice "
@entity193 : " lies and coverup make problems worse . the truth can mend fences "
