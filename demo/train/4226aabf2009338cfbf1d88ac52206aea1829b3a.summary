the @entity5 compiles the figures from about 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country , but does not provide explanations for changes in levels of crime			2
when population increases are factored into the statistics , officials note that the rate of crimes committed per 100,000 inhabitants shows an even larger decline -- 6.5 % -- from the rate of violence reported in 2009			0
independent academics and criminologists speculated on a wide range of possibilities for the decreases			0
among reasons cited in conversations with @entity1 were an aging population , stepped - up community policing practices , local and federal government programs targeted at youths and programs aimed at newly released prison parolees			1
nonetheless , the criminologists say high unemployment and housing issues that might have been expected to be factors have not noticeably affected the crime statistics .			1

the downward trend in violent crime continues in 2010 , the @entity5 says
criminologists say an economic slump has not affected crime statistics
the aging population and community policing practices may play a role
