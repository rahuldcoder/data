-- you 're in a restaurant , or at an airport , or on a crowded street			2
the man or woman next to you crumples to the ground			0
do you know what to do ? anyone trained in @entity11 knows the first step : check for breathing , and check for a pulse			0
if there 's no heartbeat -- what then ? that question has been the subject of intense debate , especially since 2008 when the @entity21 said that bystanders could try and keep a cardiac arrest victim alive just by pressing on the chest in a hard , quick rhythm			1
how fast ? the exact pace of the @entity27 ' " staying alive			2
" a big part of the thinking is that people are more likely to attempt resuscitation if they do n't have to perform rescue breaths , also known as mouth - to - mouth			2
an unresolved question has been whether chest - compression - only cpr , sometimes known as @entity37 , is truly just as good as the original			2
two large studies published wednesday in the @entity40 seem to provide an answer : yes			0
the two papers are remarkably similar in design and results			0
one was conducted in @entity46 -- mostly the @entity48 suburbs -- and in @entity49 , @entity50			0
the other study was done in @entity52			0
in both cases , patients whose hearts had stopped received either traditional cpr , or a version with chest - compressions only			1
the patients were divided randomly , with 911 dispatchers giving instructions to callers who performed the cpr			0
in the @entity48 - @entity49 experiment , patients receiving chest compressions without mouth - to - mouth were more likely to survive without brain damage			1
in both experiments , patients getting chest - compressions only were more likely to survive , period			1
in both cases , the difference was small enough that it was not considered statistically significant			0
but the authors -- and an accompanying editorial -- all said the findings support the idea that bystanders should be encouraged to do steady chest compressions on victims of apparent cardiac arrest , without pausing to give breaths			1
dr. @entity84 , an emergency physician who helped develop the 2008 @entity21 guidelines , agrees			0
" our fundamental position is that doing something is better than doing nothing			0
this [ studies ] confirms that there is very little benefit to giving breaths , in the majority of cardiac arrest cases , " @entity84 said in an interview			1
dr. @entity98 of @entity99 , who wrote the editorial accompanying the two papers , cautioned in a separate statement that there are some exceptions to the rule			0
" it is very important to understand that the patients in this study were adults and that for most children who suffer cardiac arrest , such as drowning victims , we must do rescue breathing			1
" he also said patients with chronic lung disease or acute asthma , should also receive mouth - to - mouth			0
the @entity119 issued a statement , saying it considers traditional cpr to be better , but that compressions without mouth - to - mouth " is an acceptable alternative for those who are unwilling , unable , or not trained to perform full @entity11			2
" there are some indications the new papers actually understate the overall benefit of @entity37			0
last november , at an @entity21 meeting , a group from @entity130 reported significantly better outcomes for people who received @entity37 from a bystander , than for those getting cpr with mouth - to - mouth			1
chest compressions work by circulating oxygen that is already present in the blood			1
the bloodstream of a person breathing normally -- up until a cardiac arrest -- contains enough oxygen to sustain life for several minutes			1
however , oxygen ca n't nourish cells -- most importantly , brain cells -- unless it is circulated , either by a beating heart or by chest compressions			1
it 's unclear whether @entity37 is effective simply because it minimizes interruption to chest compressions , maintaining a steady flow of blood , or if the explanation is more complex			1
oxygen starvation triggers a cascade of damaging chemical reactions inside cells			2
some studies suggest that returning oxygen to the mix too soon could make the damage even worse , and that it 's better to keep oxygen levels relatively low in the first minutes after the heart stops			2
whatever the mechanism , the new papers are likely to give momentum to an overhaul of the way @entity11 is done around the country			0
in @entity172 and @entity48 , 911 dispatchers already teach callers to use chest compressions only , in cases of apparent cardiac arrest			1
officials in @entity179 and @entity180 say their 911 dispatchers " stress " or " push " chest compressions			1
@entity185 , director of @entity130 's emergency services , thinks other cities will follow the same path			2
" i really believe these are landmark papers , and that they 'll help communities move towards a system where dispatchers give compression - only instructions , " @entity185 said			0
while the two trials described in @entity40 involve rescue attempts by lay people , the same techniques also are being investigated for professional emts			0
this fall , a randomized trial will get under way in several cities , including @entity48 , where some cardiac arrest victims will receive @entity37 while others get traditional resuscitation			1
after the first six minutes , when existing oxygen in the bloodstream would most likely be used up , all victims will receive additional ventilation			2
the experiments are part of a larger movement -- including better coordination of emergency response , and techniques like cooling patients who suffer cardiac arrest -- that has taken cardiac arrest from being a condition that was almost inevitably fatal , to one where substantial numbers of victims are saved			1
in @entity130 last year , rescuers saved nearly a third of cardiac arrest victims who were considered " saveable " -- meaning that someone saw them collapse and their hearts still had at least faint electrical rhythms			1
according to @entity84 , the takeaway message is that it 's easy for a bystander to radically improve the odds			0
if you see someone collapse without a pulse , he says , " you should at least provide chest compressions			1
the most important thing is to move blood			0
