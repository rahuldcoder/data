@entity0 -- " excited " after a meeting thursday with @entity3 , tea party favorite sen. @entity5 urged fellow @entity6 to be realistic and rally around the party 's eventual nominee , making his plea the same day the ex-governor 's chief rival suggested voters would be as well off with president @entity13 as they would @entity3			1
in addition to fundraising events , @entity3 was in @entity0 to hold talks with @entity5 as well as legislators from @entity18 and @entity19 , which hold primaries next month			1
the legislators included @entity23 chairman @entity22 , according to @entity6 aides			2
" i 'm not only comfortable with @entity3 , i 'm excited about the possibility of him possibly being our nominee , " said @entity5 , a well known conservative , claiming he was impressed by @entity3 but stopping short of giving him a full endorsement			1
adding that " i just think we just need to look at where we are , " @entity5 strongly suggested that rival candidates @entity32 and @entity33 should drop out to end the nomination fight and focus the party 's efforts on defeating @entity13 in november			1
" i just hope at some point they 'll realize whether they can win or not , " @entity5 said of @entity3 's top opponents			1
" if they ca n't , the best thing they can probably do is to help the one who is going to win			0
" this apparent call for unity contrasted sharply with the message offered thursday by @entity32 , who has been @entity3 's foremost challenger in large part thanks to support from conservative voters			1
the former @entity18 senator said in a @entity52 speech that the only way for @entity6 to win was " by giving people the choice ... not someone who is just going to be a little different than the person in there			2
" " if we are going to be a little different , we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk in what may be the @entity64 candidate , " @entity32 said			2
he was referring to earlier comments from a top @entity3 adviser , @entity66 , who said his campaign will " hit a reset button " to take on @entity13 in the fall if @entity3 wins the @entity6 nomination			1
he added , " it 's almost like an @entity64			0
you can kind of shake it up , and we start all over again			0
" @entity3 quickly blasted @entity32 's remarks , saying in a statement he was " disappointed to hear that @entity32 would rather have @entity13 as president than a @entity6			1
" " any of the @entity6 running would be better than president @entity13 and his record of failure , " he added			1
in this swift retort , @entity3 was able to turn the tables on an opponent who , along with @entity83 , had sought to play up @entity85 's @entity64 remarks for a second day			0
they said the adviser 's remarks bring into question whether @entity3 will drop his conservative stances , some of which are different from others he 'd taken earlier in his career , in favor of more moderate positions ahead of the general election			2
on wednesday , @entity32 's campaign posted a photo on @entity100 of the candidate using an @entity64 , saying it showed him " studying up on ( @entity3 's ) policy positions			1
" a website unveiled thursday by the @entity83 campaign features the @entity66 quote above an @entity64 that highlights @entity3 's policy shifts when viewers hit a prompt labeled " shake			0
" written on the drawing toy is " @entity3 's @entity110			0
" " you have this over-and - over process where he 's pro-choice and then he 's not pro-choice ; he 's pro-gun control then he 's an @entity118 member who hunts varmints , " @entity83 said of @entity3 at a campaign event thursday in @entity112 , @entity113			1
" ... if you 're serious about changing @entity0 , you ca n't use an @entity64			0
you ca n't have a child 's toy for a president			0
" on the @entity124 website , blogger @entity124 wrote thursday that the @entity64 image " is what conservatives have been warning about for months with @entity3			0
" " he is a liberal			0
he has no core convictions and as soon as he becomes the nominee , he will move far to the left , " @entity124 continued			0
@entity3 , who scored the prized endorsement of former @entity135 gov. @entity134 on wednesday , explained the @entity64 remark by saying , " organizationally , a general election campaign takes on a different profile			0
" " the issues i am running on will be exactly the same , " he said			0
" i am running as a conservative @entity6			2
i was a conservative @entity6 governor			2
i will be running as a conservative @entity6 nominee , at that point hopefully , for president			2
the policies and positions are the same			0
" the caricature of @entity3 as a politically motivated flip - flopper extends far beyond the @entity6 campaign and right - wing blogosphere			1
in an interview broadcast thursday on @entity150 , @entity13 said @entity3 was " pretending " the health care plan he helped institute as governor of @entity154 differed from the national plan that @entity156 in @entity157 passed two years ago			1
@entity32 and other conservatives have repeatedly attacked @entity3 over the @entity154 health care plan , while @entity3 says he never called for implementing such a program at the federal level			1
in the radio interview , @entity13 pointed to similarities between the two plans without mentioning the @entity6 front - runner by name			1
" we designed a program that actually previously had support of @entity6 , including the person who may end up being the @entity6 standard bearer and is now pretending like he came up with something different , " @entity13 said			1
this week 's @entity174 result gave @entity3 at least 41 of the 54 delegates at stake in the contest to face off with @entity13 , increasing his total to 562 , according to @entity1 's estimate			1
@entity32 is second with 249 , @entity83 third with 137 and @entity182 rep. @entity181 last with 69			0
a total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the @entity6 nomination			0
@entity32 said he expects to do better in coming primaries and caucuses , including @entity113 on saturday			1
the former senator has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative @entity191 states , winning @entity192 and @entity193 a week ago while @entity3 finished third			2
" this is the last chance , in a sense , for the conservative area of the country to plant their flag , and we felt very good about what @entity192 and @entity193 did , " @entity32 said in an interview thursday with @entity196 radio station @entity195			2
" they restarted this race again			0
" another @entity32 victory in @entity113 would continue the pattern of the race , while a @entity3 win would signal growing support from the conservative base that he needs to finish off his rivals			1
@entity83 , who appears increasingly unlikely to mount another comeback after two previous campaign surges , said thursday he is used to fighting from behind			0
" almost everywhere i 've campaigned , because of the way of the money , we start behind and then we gain ground , " @entity83 told about 100 supporters in @entity217 , @entity113			0
@entity1 's @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
