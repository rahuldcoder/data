-- with motor fluid spraying their faces and the weight of a car numbing their bodies , two @entity2 college students struggled to stay calm after a drunk driver allegedly tore into their home , ripping them from their slumber			1
@entity12 and @entity13 were asleep in their home last week when a motorist allegedly drove into their bedroom around 4 a.m. , mistakenly believing it was his ex-girlfriend 's home			1
the @entity2 students spent almost an hour pinned between the car and their bed while emergency workers battled furiously to free them			1
somehow , the two left the scene with relatively minor scrapes and burns -- and a new lease on life , @entity13 said			2
" when you experience something like that there 's no limits anymore , you can try to do whatever you want to do , " @entity13 told @entity29 's @entity28			2
" we feel like we have more of a purpose , like we were meant to live			0
" authorities say the motorist was drunk when he drove into the couple 's home in @entity40 , mistakenly believing it was the home of his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend			1
@entity44 is accused of drunken driving , battery with a deadly weapon , possession of a stolen vehicle , driving without a license and careless driving for his alleged role in the crash , which occurred october 21 , according to the @entity55			2
initially , @entity56 struggled to comprehend what had happened to him after being abruptly torn from his slumber			2
" i thought the roof caved in from an earthquake because it 's an old house , " @entity56 said			0
then , his girlfriend began screaming and parts of the car came into focus , helping @entity56 to groggily piece the scene together , " i could see the tire to the right side and i was like , there 's a car on top of me right now , " he said			0
" that was really hard to get through my head			0
" as fluid poured from the car , burning @entity12 's face , the couple feared that the car might explode with them underneath , he said			1
@entity56 credited the slackness of the bed for preventing their legs from breaking altogether as the weight of the car pinned his girlfriend 's entire body and his lower half to the bed			1
" she was screaming really badly because i could actually move above my chest and neck , but she could n't move anything , " he said			0
the couple calmed down somewhat after emergency workers arrived at the scene , using chainsaws to rip through the wall , @entity13 said			1
about 42 minutes later , they had lifted the car enough to let the couple wiggle out from underneath it without it crushing their lower bodies			1
" when the car was lifted and you could see blood circulating back through my legs , that was probably the happiest moment of my life : yes ! i 'm not paralyzed , " he said			0
" i was so happy , hugging everyone and making sure @entity12 was all right , " he said			2
" i was just real happy to get out of there			0
" the couple is accepting donations through the @entity118 to replace items lost in the incident			0
