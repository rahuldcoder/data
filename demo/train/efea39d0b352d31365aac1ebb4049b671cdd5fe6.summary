-- there was a pretty epic party on wednesday night			1
you probably were n't there			2
but do n't take it personally			2
we ca n't all be awesome			0
naturally , of course , i was present , showing up casually late because it 's what awesome people do at epic parties			1
that , and defile the mashed potatoes			0
granted , this particular epic party was held on @entity16			1
and it was hosted by @entity18			0
and , technically , everybody was invited			0
thus , i 'm suddenly now beginning to question my awesomeness			0
me : " am i awesome ? " me : " not really			0
" me : " i appreciate your honesty			0
" me : " whatever , nerd			0
" ok , so maybe it 's not @entity25 , but there was a popular online party hosted by the @entity28 to promote the pharmacy 's cosmetic offerings via social media			1
and for a good hour or so during the big digital soiree , the hashtag was a leading trend			0
hurrah ! victory for the marketing department ! treat yourself to some hooker makeup			1
that section exists , right ? ) not surprisingly , however , a random dude eventually entered the conversation and was instantly confused			0
@ @entity43 wrote : " this is a joke right ? " not a joke			0
@entity18 really managed to get people talking about and participating in their virtual @entity16 party , which is pretty amazing			1
but how exactly does something like this work ? basically , i guess a @entity16 party is just like any other party			1
except there 's no guacamole , and if you happen to do a keg stand , it 's not because everybody else was doing one			1
it 's because you 're a degenerate alcoholic			1
" wooooo ! thirty seconds ! i rule ! and now i have to fold the laundry ... and do other stuff because i 'm home alone with my computer ... drinking ... from a keg			0
" personally speaking , the most appealing aspect of a digital @entity16 party is that i only have 140 characters to completely embarrass myself			1
which , i suppose , is quite more than enough			0
" see ? minimal damage			0
but let 's get back to this beauty club			1
essentially , anyone can join for free to get periodic discounts and rewards on various @entity18 cosmetics			1
the online information was n't exactly clear , though , as to whether @entity76 qualifies			0
its inclusion , however , more or less determines my interest in signing up			0
i 'm all about discounts and @entity16 parties and @entity76 and maybe even a touch of mascara when i 'm feeling pretty , but i 'm not exactly sure this is qualifies as a " club			1
" clubs have to have standards , and i simply ca n't appreciate any exclusive organization that does n't charge excessive dues and / or base one 's membership on blatant superficiality			1
that 's why back in the day i joined a fraternity			1
best friends money could buy ! look , i know i did n't offer the @entity105 chapter of @entity107 anything in terms of social status , and i 'm pretty sure i lowered their overall combined @entity110 by at least a full point , but i was more than willing to pay the yearly fees			2
and as a bonus , i could pretty easily be talked into running around the party wearing nothing but a strategically placed sock			2
( had there been cell phone cameras in the late 90s , i 'd currently be living in @entity120			0
) at the @entity28 , there are no initiation fees			1
and technically , i suppose , even @entity124 could join			2
but for those of us who do n't use cosmetics or , at the very least , are n't planning on going to the @entity130 , there 's probably no real need to apply			2
we 're fine the way we are			2
unless , of course , you really just want to experiment with ointments and colors and masks			0
in which case , by all means join the @entity28 and start saving			1
hell , go nuts ! treat yourself to some hooker makeup .			2

in " @entity144 , " @entity143 tackles trending social - media *topics*
this week , he *crashes* the @entity28 's @entity16 party
yes , that was really a thing
you can join even if you 're not a @entity154 -- or a hooker
