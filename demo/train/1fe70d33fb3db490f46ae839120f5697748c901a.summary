-- is it " @entity3 " for the faithful ? " @entity8 , " starring @entity9 and directed by @entity10 , opened in theaters today , and the critics have plenty to say about the epic			1
for the most part , it appears the critics appreciate the efforts of both @entity9 and @entity10 -- who is best known for controversial films such as " @entity17 " and " @entity18 " -- even if they do n't think the pair quite pull it off			1
@entity21 of @entity22 says , " this film 's inscrutable oddness -- and the willingness to take chances -- brought me to a place that could not have predicted			2
during the film 's third act i had no idea how this movie was going to end			2
even more exciting , once the credits rolled , i had to spend some time to work out how i felt			0
in fact , i 'm still thinking about it			0
" " @entity38 " is how @entity35 of @entity36 describes the big - budget flick			0
" there 's a tension that runs through the whole film about who you should be rooting for , or if it 's even possible to root for anyone in this situation , " he writes			0
" @entity8 goes to such dark places over the course of the movie that it 's impossible to keep relating to him as a protagonist ( sometimes to the point of comedy , intentional or otherwise ) , and it becomes necessary for the narrative to switch its viewpoint from character to character			2
" the headline for @entity61 's review for the wrap reads , " @entity10 's biblical ' @entity63 ' mostly runs aground			1
" @entity61 says that " unlike the thousands of @entity66 beasts of the land and air who hitch a ride on ' @entity8 , ' @entity10 's highly - anticipated epic is neither fish nor fowl ; in no way is it a straightforward @entity74 tale ( and given the brevity of @entity78 ' account of the flood , such a thing would be next to impossible ) nor is it the sort of unfettered freak - out that fans of ' @entity18 , ' ' @entity82 ' or ' @entity83 ' would expect from its director and co-writer ( with @entity86 )			1
" @entity88 's @entity87 writes that " @entity8 " " is not just one of the most ambitious films i 've seen this year , it 's one of the most ambitious films i 've ever seen			1
it 's a movie that is spilling over with ideas and images and emotional explorations of the metaphysical			0
" opinion : is ' @entity8 ' sacred enough ? @entity99 of the @entity100 says the film is " equal parts ridiculous and magnificent			2
" and while noting that @entity9 " turns out to be perfectly cast in the title role , " @entity99 writes that " the parts of ' @entity8 ' that do n't work really , truly do n't			2
but the parts that do almost sweep you away in the flood			0
" as the @entity109 notes , the film has had its fair share of controversy , including complaints that there is a lack of mention of @entity116 in the film			0
@entity109 film critic @entity118 calls it a slightly different take on the biblical story and writes , " the result is a movie that is clearly deeply respectful of its source material but also at times startlingly revisionist , a go - for - broke throwback to @entity128 biblical epics of yore that combines grandeur and grace , as well as a generous dollop of goofy overstatement			0
" viewers may not agree about what they 've seen when they come out of ' @entity8 , ' " she said			0
" but there 's no doubt that @entity10 has made an ambitious , serious , even visionary motion picture , whose super-sized popcorn - movie vernacular may occasionally submerge the story 's more reflective implications , but never drowns them entirely			1
" likewise , @entity142 of @entity143 cautions , " my advice : hold off on burning @entity10 at the stake till you see @entity8 , a film of grit , grace and visual wonders that for all its tech - head modernity is built on a spiritual core			1
the @entity153 - born @entity10 and his @entity155 roomie and writing partner , @entity86 -- ' two not very religious @entity158 guys , ' says the director -- are hellbent on making their @entity8 relevant for believers and skeptics alike			1

@entity10 's " @entity8 " opens today
critics *applaud* the effort , even if they do n't think it entirely works
one calls the film one of the most ambitious he has seen
