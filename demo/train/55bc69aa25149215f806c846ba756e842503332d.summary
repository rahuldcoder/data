president @entity0 will ease sanctions imposed against @entity2 under the @entity4 embargo after @entity2 agreed to release @entity4 aid worker @entity5			1
the agreement will deliver the most sweeping changes in the @entity4 policy toward the nation that lies just 100 miles off the @entity4 coast since the @entity4 embargo on @entity2 started in the early 1960s			1
most @entity4 - including president @entity0 - were n't alive when the embargo went into effect			1
so get up to speed on the last five decades of @entity4 foreign policy toward @entity2			1
why did the embargo start in the first place ? the @entity4 began imposing sanctions against @entity2 after @entity19 seized power in 1959 and soon after nationalized more than $ 1 billion in @entity4 assets on the island			1
that 's two years before @entity0 was even born			2
the @entity4 ratcheted up sanctions on @entity2 in 1960 and 1961 with president @entity25 making the embargo official in 1962			1
diplomatic relations between the @entity4 and @entity2 broke off in 1961 as tensions between the two nations increased after @entity2 signed a trade agreement with the @entity31			1
relations remained mostly frozen throughout the @entity33			0
today , @entity2 remains an autocratic regime - @entity19 's brother @entity34 is president - with a poor record on human rights and a track record of silencing dissent and restricting the rights of its citizens			2
what kind of restrictions does the embargo currently impose ? the embargo not only keeps @entity4 companies from doing business in @entity2 , but also prohibits most @entity4 from traveling directly there or spending money as tourists			1
@entity4 citizens can face up to a $ 65,000 fine for spending money in @entity2 , according to the @entity54			1
the embargo also limits the amount of individuals can send to family living in @entity2			0
so what 's changing ? both countries will work toward reestablishing embassies			0
the @entity4 will ease travel restrictions , making it easier for @entity4 to travel to @entity2 and do business there			1
@entity4 and @entity2 banks will be allowed to start building relationships and that means @entity4 travelers will be able to use their credit and debit cards when visiting			1
americans returning from a trip to @entity2 can now return with up to $ 400 in @entity2 goods , a quarter of which can be spent on alcohol and tobacco			0
is @entity4 - @entity2 prisoner swap an ice breaker ? and in return , @entity2 will free 53 political prisoners and significantly relax its restrictions on internet access			1
@entity5 had been arrested after delivering satellite phones and other communications equipment to @entity2 's small @entity88 population			1
so why does n't @entity0 just end the embargo altogether ? he ca n't			0
only @entity90 can end a trade embargo , which is enshrined into law			0
but according to @entity95 officials , the president can ease certain restrictions under his executive authority			0
this is the third time @entity0 has acted to ease the embargo			2
but policy changes in 2009 and 2011 , which eased travel restrictions for @entity102 and later for academics and religious groups , did n't come close to the scope of wednesday 's landmark agreement			1
@entity2 @entity107 does the @entity4 have international backing to keep the embargo in place ? barely			2
over the last two decades , the @entity111 has voted each year against the embargo , calling on the @entity4 to reverse its policy			0
only @entity114 has joined the @entity4 in voting against the resolution			0
what 's the political climate like in the @entity4 ? it 's shifting and more political leaders and @entity2 - @entity4 have been calling for changes in the @entity4 's policy toward @entity2 in recent years			1
@entity2 refugees in the @entity4 and their descendants have historically been the most vocal group in calling for a tough @entity4 policy against @entity2			2
but nearly 7 in 10 @entity2 now favor reestablishing diplomatic relations with @entity2 and about half want the @entity4 to end the embargo , according to a @entity130 poll this summer			1
that has changed the climate of politics in the @entity135 - area and throughout @entity136 where most of the @entity2 - @entity4 community resides , a shift that is sending ripples throughout the country			2
what have politicians been saying about @entity2 recently and what 's the @entity144 got to do with it ? former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate @entity146 has called for an end to the embargo , calling it " @entity19 's best friend			0
" and president @entity0 stopped short of calling for an end to the embargo , but made it clear in 2013 that the @entity4 policy needs to change			2
" the notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today , in the age of the @entity162 and @entity163 and world travel , does n't make sense , " @entity0 said at a november 2013 fundraiser in @entity136			2
" we have to continue to update our policies			0
" a month later , @entity0 shook hands with @entity19 at @entity169 's funeral in @entity170 in a moment that played on tv screens around the world			0
since then , negotiations have continued and even the @entity144 weighed in			0
he recently wrote letters to both @entity0 and @entity19 encouraging compromise			0
but a pair of potential 2016 @entity179 presidential candidates from @entity136 have emphatically defended the embargo			0
former @entity136 gov. @entity181 , who announced tuesday his decision to " actively explore " a 2016 run , said this year the ban should actually be strengthened , not lifted			0
and sen. @entity185 , whose parents fled @entity2 after @entity19 's takeover , has called the embargo " the last tool we have remaining to ensure that democracy returns to @entity2 one day			0
" how has @entity5 ' detention impacted the debate ? @entity5 ' imprisonment in 2009 set off a series of diplomatic exchanges between the two countries that involved prominent @entity4 politicians			1
sen. @entity198 , chair of the @entity199 , led congressional delegations to @entity2 in 2012 and 2013 to secure @entity5 ' release that included in 2013 three @entity202 , a @entity179 senator and two @entity202 congressmen			1
that same year , 66 senators wrote president @entity0 urging him to " act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain [ @entity5 's ] release			1
" and in november , sens. @entity209 , a @entity179 , and @entity211 @entity210 traveled to @entity2 in another attempt to negotiate @entity5 ' release			1
in 2011 , former president @entity213 also made an attempt as did former @entity216 gov. @entity215 , whose efforts were backed by the @entity218			0
sounds like a lot of political capital has been poured into this effort			0
how much has @entity2 been impacted by the embargo ? @entity2 said in 2011 that the economic damage of the @entity4 embargo has topped $ 1 trillion in its five decade history			2
the embargo 's crippling effects on the @entity2 economy prompted @entity230 , the brother of the country 's famed dictator , to beef up efforts to end the embargo once he took the helm in 2008			2
while @entity2 was sustained by a serious trading relationship with the @entity31 throughout the @entity33 , the @entity2 economy took a hard hit with the @entity31 's collapse in 1991 .			0

@entity0 will ease sanctions imposed against @entity2 for more than 50 years following the release of @entity5
the changes will ease travel restrictions and allow @entity4 and @entity2 banks to build relationships
the changes come after a *flurry* of diplomatic efforts to free @entity5 and changes in the political dialogue in the @entity4
