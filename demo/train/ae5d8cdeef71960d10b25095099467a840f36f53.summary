editor 's note : @entity2 , author of " what would @entity3 ? " is @entity5 at the @entity7 @entity6			1
he was a lawyer and speechwriter for dr. @entity9			0
@entity10 says @entity11 is indebted to @entity9 for breaking its addiction to segregation			1
next week , the day after our national holiday commemorating the 80th birthday of dr. @entity9 , @entity14 will be sworn in as the 44th president of the @entity11 , the first @entity18 elected as president			1
@entity14 's election would not have been possible without the transformative effect of dr. @entity9 's struggle , leadership and legacy in dismantling segregation and institutional racism in the @entity11			1
@entity11 owes a great debt to dr. @entity9			1
prior to him , our nation was like a dysfunctional drug addict or alcoholic , hooked and addicted to segregation and institutional racism			0
his " tough love " of nonviolent direct action civil disobedience forced @entity11 to confront its conscience and the immorality of racial injustice			2
dr. @entity9 enabled our country to embark on an extraordinary journey of recovery to reclaim its soul			0
he enabled us to reactivate those precepts enshrined in our declaration of @entity44 : " all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights			0
" in twelve years and four months , from 1956 to april 4 , 1968 -- except for president @entity48 and the @entity49 -- @entity9 may have done more to achieve racial , social and political justice and equality in @entity11 than any other person in our country 's history			1
dr. @entity9 had confidence in the democratic future of @entity11			1
he believed that we , as a people , would be able to " transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood			0
" i met @entity9 for the first time 49 years ago when he visited my home in @entity65 to enlist my assistance in the defense of a criminal tax indictment against him by the state of @entity70			0
only six months earlier , i had graduated from @entity71			0
i worked for him as a law clerk , political organizer , personal lawyer and , at his request , i drafted speeches for dr. @entity9 until his death on april 4 , 1968			0
he was an ordained @entity78 minister before he was a civil rights leader			0
his religious faith and abiding belief in @entity81 were the fuel that ignited the engine of his moral leadership			0
president - elect @entity14 's religion and belief in @entity81 appear central to his political leadership			1
during the 40 years following dr , @entity9 's assassination in @entity90 , the most recurring question asked of me has been : " who today , what black leader , if anyone , is most like dr. @entity9 ? " i would consistently answer that dr. @entity9 was sui generis , one of a kind and , then ask rhetorically : " who today is most like @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 or @entity105 ? " since @entity14 's election , i have been asked : is @entity14 another @entity9 ? what would dr. @entity9 say about the election of @entity14 ? does the election of @entity14 , as the first @entity18 - @entity18 president of the @entity11 , mean that dr. @entity9 's dream has been fulfilled ? does @entity14 's election indicate that racism for all practical purposes no longer exists in @entity11 ? will @entity14 's election have any impact on the number of @entity18 men incarcerated or the high percentage of out - of - wedlock births within the @entity18 - @entity18 community ? there are no easy answers to these questions , but it is clear that those of us in the civil rights movement of the 1960s never anticipated the event we will witness tuesday			1
after the assassination of president @entity129 , and the assumption of the presidency by former vice president @entity132 , some of us who worked closely with dr. @entity9 , concluded no fundamental change in race relations in @entity11 could be accomplished successfully and sustained unless it was done under the political leadership of a white man from the south , people like presidents @entity132 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			1
our belief was predicated on the political assumption that @entity11 would be more willing to follow a white southern political leader on the issues of race relations and equal economic opportunity than a politician from another part of our country			2
we never contemplated the realistic possibility of a black president of the @entity11 in our lifetimes			2
the @entity158 sparked the prairie fires of subsequent black voter registration and voting which dramatically altered the political landscape of @entity11			0
it was this legislative foundation that fostered and facilitated the political possibility of a successful @entity14 candidacy for president			0
" we shall overcome " was our national anthem of the @entity168 under dr. @entity9 's leadership			1
president - elect @entity14 , like a masterful musical composer with perfect pitch , successfully updated , translated and rearranged " we shall overcome " to a " yes , we can " surround - sound mantra for the cell phone , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and internet - blackberry generation			2
this may be the most enduring @entity180 tribute to the legacy of @entity9 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity10 .			2

@entity10 : @entity9 cured @entity11 of addiction to racial segregation
he says @entity9 's work helped make @entity14 's *victory* possible
@entity2 : leaders assumed only white @entity193 presidents could make *progress*
he says they never anticipated election of an @entity18 - @entity18 president
