-- the @entity1 has come under some flack of late for its one - size - fits - all rating system and vague - at - best explanations for those ratings			1
but there 's a fun flip - side to the murkiness : speculating on what those ratings and their explanations might infer about the movie in question â € ” in this case , " @entity9			2
" the @entity1 handed a @entity17 rating today to " @entity9 , " for " intense sequences of violence and action , some sensuality and language			1
" the rating itself does not mean the movie is totally done -- films often screen well before the director is finished with technical elements like visual effects , sound design , and color timing			2
but it does provide us with a tantalizing indication for what may be in store with a wildly anticipated film that has otherwise put a high premium on plot details			1
namely : language ? sensuality ? intriguing ! as a point of comparison , 2008â € ²s " @entity43 " won its @entity17 for " intense sequences of violence and some menace " ; 2005â € ²s " @entity48 " was a @entity17 due to " intense action violence , disturbing images , and some thematic elements			1
" beyond the obvious differences between " violence and action , " " violence and some menace , " and " action violence [ and ] disturbing images , " it appears that the final film in this trilogy is branching out into some new territory for the franchise			2
the " sensuality " could mean @entity62 ( @entity63 ) gets horizontal with a cat - suited @entity64 ( @entity66 )			0
and " language " suggests masked villain @entity68 ( @entity69 ) could provoke @entity62 's potty mouth			0
if that means we get to see more of @entity63 's physique and legendary way with four - letter words , so much the better			0
