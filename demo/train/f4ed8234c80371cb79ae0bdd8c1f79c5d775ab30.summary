-- as he prepares sunday 's @entity3 halftime show , @entity1 is n't free with details about what its millions of viewers should expect			1
" i 'm fairly sure that the lights will stay on for the entire @entity16 , " said @entity1 , the @entity8 - nominated director of this year 's show , which will feature singer @entity11 singer @entity10 and rockers @entity13			1
" i would be surprised if that happened again			0
" moments after @entity19 finished her performance last year , the @entity18 went dark for 35 minutes			2
" not guilty , " says @entity1 , a native of @entity21 , @entity22 , who began his career with the @entity24			1
" the only thing i can say with certainty was that the electricity going out had nothing to do with the halftime show because we were on generator power , " said @entity1 , who also directed last year 's show			1
" it was a conscious decision , and it was an excellent decision			0
" the funniest tweets of the @entity34 ... er ... @entity16 more than 110.5 million people worldwide watched the halftime show last year			1
only 2012 's performance by @entity38 drew more viewers , and @entity19 's performance -- and the blackout that followed -- generated 229,000 tweets per minute on @entity43 , its second most - tweeted moment ever			1
the production is something of a technological marvel in and of itself			0
last year , 700 people transformed the field at the @entity18 into a concert stage incorporating lasers , strobes , pyrotechnics and a preprogrammed stage floor that rose to become a 24 - foot by 32 - foot video wall			2
@entity1 is no stranger to such on - the - fly productions			1
in addition to several @entity16 halftimes , he 's directed the @entity58 , the @entity59 and live concert films for artists such as the @entity62 and @entity63			1
in 2012 , he worked with movie director @entity64 , heading up the televised versions of the @entity67 opening and closing ceremonies			1
this year 's @entity10 production will be no less complex than last year 's , said @entity1			1
but do n't be surprised if the high - tech nature of the show is n't in your face the whole time			2
" with the kind of stuff that i do , technology is amazing			2
but at the end of the day , stories are way more powerful , " he said			0
" so , if you 've got somebody on a stage crying because an award means so much to them , or an artist on stage singing an incredibly powerful song to an audience that 's with them -- sometimes you just need one shot , one light and an amazing performer			2
" " technology 's massively important , " @entity95 continued			1
" you rely on it			0
" but even as the technology at his disposal has improved , @entity1 says he 's come to look at it differently			1
" back in the day , i let the technology lead me , " he said			2
" now , i always prefer the story or the music or the show to lead me			2
now , in my own head , it 's the story first , the concept first , and the technology is second			1
" technology allows you to do things now you could have never done before			0
so there 's definitely a yin and a yang to it			0
" in some ways , what @entity1 does is simultaneously the same and the exact opposite of what a movie director does			1
for a movie , a shoot can last for weeks , or months , with weeks more of post-production after that			0
on the flip side , directing a live event means months of preparation , followed by a shoot that lasts for just a brief time			0
in the case of the @entity16 show , that 's about 12 minutes			1
it might seem like that would be a chaotic 12 minutes			0
but @entity1 said that with enough preparation , the opposite can be the case			2
" when i was shooting the ( 2013 ) show , i actually said very little , " he said			0
" because what we were doing was shooting a show that we all knew precisely what we were doing			0
" we knew where @entity19 was going to be at all points			0
we knew when the crowd was going to go crazy			0
we knew almost exactly the show we were going to get			0
" but @entity1 , who is also working on a @entity148 concert film he shot at several concerts last year , will have one new x-factor to deal with this sunday			1
this year 's game will be at @entity152 at the @entity153 -- an outdoor venue			1
the @entity156 @entity155 already has been clobbered this winter by storms that have dumped more than a foot of snow in places and brought temperatures in the single digits -- a full 15 to 25 degrees below normal before what was already predicted to be the coldest @entity16 in the game 's history			1
last week , 10 inches of snow fell on @entity152			0
the early forecast for sunday in @entity169 is for clear skies and milder temperatures , but you never know			0
" the weather 's an enormous factor , " @entity1 said			1
" but , in every @entity16 , it has its unique challenges			2
and from those unique challenges , you create something great			0
if every situation were the same , the shows may not be as diverse as they are			0
" @entity1 hinted heavily that the open stadium will be somehow utilized in sunday 's halftime show			1
" i guess what i 'm trying to say is , in each set of circumstances ... we find creative solutions , " he said			0
" we 're tested and pushed in this direction , as opposed to another , and that 's kind of exciting			2

@entity1 has directed @entity16 halftime shows , @entity58 , @entity67 ceremonies
he says technology is crucial but can *distract* from performances
last year 's @entity16 blackout was not caused by halftime show , @entity1 says
he says the *extreme* weather possibility this year is a concern but also " exciting "
