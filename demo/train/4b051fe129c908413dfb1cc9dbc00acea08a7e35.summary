-- when change comes , it comes all of a sudden , leaving only a remembrance of the past , a previous present , as its memorial			0
a moment as sudden as @entity8 prime minister @entity7 's realization that there was a " wind of change blowing through this continent , whether we like it or not " prior to the granting of independence to so many @entity17 people 50 years ago			1
it is this wind that now blows again over @entity17			1
this time it is less political than economic but it will be just as permanent and just as shocking			2
and this time , it will not be awkward majors from disbanded colonial battalions muttering into their beer , it will be our well - meaning liberals that will be left behind , lumpen in its wake like a broken @entity26 army			0
this change will not happen because of a million posters showing our babies starving with flies in their eyes or the perpetual funds raised for mosquito nets as a panacea against our ineffective drainage systems			0
though the lives of many millions were saved by campaigns such as these			0
it will come as swift as our @entity40 , a revolution sprung by social media , and as insistent as the ringtone of our mobile phones			0
read this : latest @entity17 gold rush - hotels between 2000 and 2012 , mobile penetration grew in @entity17 from 1 % to 54 %			1
some predict that by 2014 , 69 % of mobiles on the continent will have internet access			0
this virtual infrastructure , plus the commodity boom , has meant that 7 out of 10 of the world 's fastest growing economies including , yes , @entity56 , the poster child of our @entity59 generation , are not in @entity61 but in @entity17			1
this does not mean change will be evenly spread ; it wo n't			0
the rapid urbanization and consequent youth unemployment will cause great hardship for many			0
the lack of administrative infrastructure to deal with this will ensure taxes are not collected and the facilities left to cope with this are not built or are built in the wrong place			2
aid will continue to be a necessary feature of @entity17 but despite this the realization has come that @entity17 is not poor but inestimably rich			1
and that the outright despicable , as well as our supposed friends , have been writing cheques off our backs since the day they granted an indentured independence			0
history will show that @entity17 gave more than it ever received - it is the true donor nation			1
yet despite this , @entity17 is throwing off its 300 - year yoke			1
@entity89 , too , suffered its post-colonial period , drunk on nationalism and at best neglected by its dictators			0
and in many ways , @entity17 's growth patterns mirror those of the new @entity89 's			1
in 2010 @entity89 ranked first in exports to the world market , with merchandise export sales of more than $ 1.5 trillion and a world market share of 10.4 %			2
in 1998 , @entity89 had less than 2 % of the world market			0
@entity17 has presently 3 % but with 15 % of the world 's population , 60 % of world 's uncultivated arable land and a fast - growing proportion of the world 's discovered valuable natural resources , @entity17 's potential for growth over the next 10 years is greater than @entity89 's over the same period			1
read this : @entity17 's skyscraper cities @entity112 , global chief economist of @entity113 , estimates that @entity17 's gdp will increase from $ 2 trillion to $ 29 trillion in today 's money by 2050			1
@entity17 will produce more gdp than the combined economies of the @entity117 and @entity118 do today			2
in 2007 , i co-hosted with the then @entity121 president @entity120 , a dinner for 50 of the @entity17 presidents and explained how these changes would come			2
back then , these words floated like fairy tales but they are becoming commonplace now in investment circles : @entity17 is rising			2
last week , i returned with my @entity128 , this time to the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) during its annual general meeting , in its 50th anniversary year , to ensure that as this growth happens it benefits not just everyone else in the developed and the @entity136 economies but @entity17 as well and in a fundamental and equitable way			1
that 's why i invited @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 to come along too , to advocate for the @entity129 's audacious $ 68 billion @entity145 plan to transform the continent in building railways , roads , clean water supplies and those things we take for granted -- the basic infrastructure of communication and trade to enable worthwhile lives for all our people			1
the @entity129 's plan is to raise funds through a guarantee backed by the @entity17 nations : @entity17 helping @entity17 -- the ultimate trade - not - aid policy			1
as @entity140 said to the philanthropist @entity162 , one of @entity164 's richest men : " it 's about self - sufficiency and about how @entity17 can benefit itself , having benefited so many nations through its natural resources , history , culture and its people and now it 's about a fair exchange and what @entity17 can do for itself			1
" watch : made in @entity175 i mixed these great talents from the diaspora and @entity17 in amongst the finance ministers , bankers and entrepreneurs			1
this is what a designer looks for : the harmony in contrasts			0
they find their common desire to make it happen -- one group bringing this solution to the global audience , giving it transparency and encouraging investment , and the other group implementing it			0
that 's why i set up @entity128 with the support of a fast - growing @entity164 business , @entity197			0
the message is quite simple : a small group of nations can not forever benefit from keeping the majority of nations and people in a state of weakness			0
the peoples and continents of the world are not separate , they are part of the same social and economic system : a system that must return to balance and harmony			0
but this balance can only occur when @entity17 itself realizes that it is time for @entity17			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			2

@entity217 says @entity17 is in the midst of an economic boom
he addressed bankers at the @entity129 annual meeting
@entity217 is advocating for @entity129 plan to spend $ 68 billion on @entity17 's infrastructure
