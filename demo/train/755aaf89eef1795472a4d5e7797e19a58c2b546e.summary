-- the comparison would probably irk @entity3 purists , but it 's easy to see why some of @entity7 's fans liken his fancy footwork to the late " @entity3 " the @entity11 skateboarder 's stylish 360 - degree toe spins , seen through the artful lens of filmmaker and friend @entity14 , have a mesmerizing quality -- much like the rest of his repertoire			1
@entity7 's artistic flourishes may not be as grandiose as some you 'll witness in a skate park ; you wo n't find the 27 - year - old chasing air in halfpipes , for example			1
his tricks are more delicate , his approach more artistic			2
" to me skateboarding is an art form , " @entity7 tells @entity0 's human to @entity27			1
" i 'm able to put my thoughts into it , picture stuff and then draw it ... using the world as my canvas and the skateboard as a brush			0
" those canvases , as millions have witnessed on @entity40 , range from abandoned train station ticket halls and derelict water parks to art galleries and deserted cityscapes in the @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- the place where @entity7 's skateboarding odyssey started			1
born and raised in @entity51 , skating did n't figure much in his early childhood			2
like most kids he played soccer but also competed as a gymnast and enjoyed surfing on family vacations in the @entity59			2
the athleticism learned at the gym has clearly informed his skating style , but it was a love of the waves that ultimately influenced his future			2
" when i was in @entity51 i could n't surf , so i thought that skateboarding could help my surfing , " he explains			0
" that 's basically why i started skating			1
then i got hooked ... and i stopped going to gymnastics when i was 16 years old			1
i love skateboarding because of the creative side of it			0
there 's so much variety , so much you can do			2
" streets ahead @entity7 has made his name in a branch of skating called street freestyle made famous by @entity45 pro legend @entity81			1
often referred to as the godfather of the genre , @entity81 invented numerous moves in the 1980s which are now commonplace today , including the flatground ollie and a host of flip tricks			1
" freestyle skateboarding is pretty much how skateboarding started , " says @entity7			1
" in freestyle skating there are n't really any rules and you can skate however you want			2
what i do is mix that freestyle skating with the streets ( doing ) spins , handstands and rail tricks on obstacles			1
" initially , he plied his trade as a competition skater but after winning the 2010 @entity101 freestyle in @entity102 , @entity103 he switched to making films			2
none are particularly long -- most last around five minutes -- but all are jam - packed with tricks that @entity7 makes look easy			1
but the reality is often rather different			0
" sometimes i 'll be trying tricks hundreds of times and i 'll be completely exhausted and not really wanting to do it anymore but i push myself , " he reveals			0
there is also the task of knitting separate tricks together into a flowing sequence -- which is not easy in freestyle , a discipline sometimes derided for being a jerky , stop - start affair			1
" sometimes i 'll have my eyes closed and picture myself ( doing a trick )			0
as i am filming it my mind and ( visualizing ) how it looks , i start to think of tricks i 've done before and how i can keep the flow and how i can make a variation , " @entity7 explains			1
evolving tricks is just as important as creating new ones , he says , pointing to his embellishment of the " daffy " -- an old and relatively simple maneuver where a skater straddles two boards , riding one behind the other			1
" i 've been able through the years to take that trick from flat ground to obstacles and come up with some ideas ( integrating ) the ollie , heelflip and going backwards			0
it 's something that i 'm proud of , " he says			0
@entity142 @entity7 's talent has led to some unique opportunities , like skating to @entity146 's " @entity145 , " in a commercial for a brand of whisky			1
he teamed up with a choreographer @entity150 for the two - day shoot at the @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154 at the end of last year			2
" when i was skating @entity150 was giving me ideas			0
it was something very new to me			0
i listen when people give me suggestions for new tricks but a lot of the time it does n't make sense because they 're not skaters , " @entity7 says			1
" but a lot of what he was saying was making sense ... he came up for an idea for a wall trick			0
i was like ' wow , ' this guy has so much style			0
afterwards , i had a whole new respect for him			0
" more recently , @entity7 has hooked up with his buddy @entity14 again to shoot the next installment of his freestyle adventures			1
life could not be better for the @entity179 , who is now based in @entity180 -- the cradle of the sport			0
" what really makes me happy is making skate videos , " he says			0
" my goal is to develop my skating , basically take it to another level			0
it 's not really about changing skateboarding , but changing my own skateboarding			0
" it 's something that i want to do for the rest of my life , as long as i have legs ... well even if i do n't , ' cause i 'll do a handstand ! " read more : the ' @entity197 ' who spawned a golden legacy read more : the rise of the ' new @entity200 '			0
