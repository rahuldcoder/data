@entity0 -- vowing to continue to " underwrite global security " -- but not alone -- the @entity4 administration thursday released its first @entity5 , a 52 - page outline of the president 's strategic approach and priorities			1
the @entity5 , required by @entity10 of every administration to be prepared every four years , for the first time combines homeland security and national security , focusing not only on threats internationally but on the threat of home - grown radicals inspired and recruited by @entity19			1
" we view this as an important and emerging challenge , " @entity20 , deputy national security adviser for strategic communication , told reporters			1
@entity19 , he said , is less capable of using safe havens for training abroad and is now " trying to inspire @entity27 to carry out attacks on the @entity27 " those @entity27 , he said , may have less direct contact with the terrorist organization but they carry @entity27 passports and know the strengths and weaknesses of the @entity27			0
" several recent incidents of violent extremists in the @entity27 who are committed to fighting here and abroad have underscored the threat to the @entity27 and our interests posed by individuals radicalized at home , " the @entity5 states			2
" our best defenses against this threat are well informed and equipped families , local communities and institutions			0
" @entity49 , state and local governments will use intelligence , expanded community engagement and development programs to help local communities address the radicalization of @entity27 before they join @entity19 , @entity20 said			0

the @entity27 must engage also with other " 21st century centers of influence -- including @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , " the report says			0
in a switch from the @entity91 administration 's doctrine of pre-emptive war , the @entity5 says the @entity27 will " draw on diplomacy , development , and international norms and institutions to resolve disagreements , prevent conflict , and maintain peace , mitigating wherever possible the need for the use of force			2
" " while the use of force is sometimes necessary , " it says , " we will exhaust other options before war whenever we can , and carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs and risks of inaction			0
" the @entity5 also highlights " burden sharing , " working with other countries to deal with international threats			2
" the @entity27 needs to foster burden - sharing so it 's not on our shoulders alone , " @entity20 told reporters			0
the administration 's focus on domestic terrorism is drawing some criticism from opponents who claim it " ignores reality ' by avoiding terms like " radical @entity125			1
