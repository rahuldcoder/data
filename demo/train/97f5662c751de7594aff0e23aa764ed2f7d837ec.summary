@entity0 -- closing arguments concluded friday in the trial of former @entity5 gov. @entity4 and his wife @entity6			1
the two are accused of conspiring to commit corruption after accepting money loans from a person hoping to gain the governor 's influential support for a business product			1
prosecutors argued during their closing that @entity4 , while seemingly taking responsibility for his actions , blamed others at every turn			1
@entity4 's defense rides on the claim that he did not know his wife @entity6 had accepted loans from @entity25 , who was seeking support from the governor for a product from his nutritional supplement company			1
nor did he know that she had accepted designer dresses or a @entity34 watch as a gift from @entity25 , defense lawyers said			2
during the trial , salacious details about the couple 's marriage came out , detailing that purportedly they barely spoke after 38 years of marriage and thus , said the defense , could not have conspired to corrupt			2

" he was a strong governor			0
he was a weak husband , " prosecutor @entity45 said of the one - time rising star in the @entity47 who had potential presidential ambitions			1
@entity4 , wife plead not guilty to gift charges prosecutors alleged that once @entity52 became aware of the investigation about the corruption , she returned the designer dresses that she received from @entity25			1
she wrote a note to @entity25 saying that she hoped his daughters could wear the dresses after she received them on loan , or that even they could be auctioned for a worthy charity			0
the prosecution pointed out that @entity25 ' daughters are smaller in size than @entity64 if the dresses were in fact on loan , that would not be a crime			0
the governor 's wife waited two years to return them , however			2
the defense also argued that there is no direct effect of those loans or other gifts given to the @entity78 that caused the governor use official actions to help @entity25 and his business , prosecutors said they do n't need to prove there was a direct action based on the alleged bribes but did note @entity25 was able to have his business featured during an event at the executive mansion , and the governor pitched his product during a meeting with state workers			1
defense lawyers also contended @entity25 was only out for himself , selling out the governor to gain immunity from alleged crimes			0
they also argued that @entity25 made up a lot of his story to give the government a bigger prize in the former governor			0
jurors will return after the @entity104 weekend to receive instructions from the judge and then head to deliberations			0
