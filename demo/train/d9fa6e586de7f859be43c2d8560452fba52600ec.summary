-- @entity3 's @entity2 spacecraft has provided your multicolored space distraction of the day : images of a swirling , six - sided weather feature on the surface of @entity10			1
scientists say the " @entity13 , " the formation 's working title at @entity3 , is unlike anything they 've seen elsewhere			0
they say the feature is " turbulent and unstable , " packing 200 - mph winds			1
that 's nearly 50 mph stronger than the wind speed required for a category 5 hurricane			0
" a hurricane on @entity24 typically lasts a week , but this has been here for decades -- and who knows -- maybe centuries , " said @entity21 , a @entity2 team member at the @entity22			0
the @entity2 spacecraft was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around @entity10 , the sixth planet from the sun , since 2004			1
@entity3 hopes it will collect more pictures and other data of @entity10 and its rings and moons through 2017			1
@entity2 had photographed the hexagon before			2
but the short video clip released this week is the first high - resolution image of the massive jet stream , and the first with color filters			2
@entity2 captured images of the hexagon over a 10 - hour time period on december 10 , 2012			2
the images , which scientists are still analyzing , are rendered in " false color , " a method that makes it easier to tell the difference between different parts of the storm			0
to human eyes , the hexagon and the planet 's north pole would appear in tones of gold and blue			0
@entity2 arrived at @entity10 in 2004			1
but @entity3 has begun getting better images of the planet from @entity2 since sunlight began bathing @entity10 's northern hemisphere with the arrival of the planet 's spring season in 2009			1
( " seasons " on @entity10 go on for years , as the distant planet 's orbit around the sun takes 29 years			0

@entity3 *shared* video of massive , multi-colored hexagon on @entity10
the image shows a weather pattern with 200 - mph winds
the @entity2 spacecraft has been orbiting @entity10 since 2004
