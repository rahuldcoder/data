-- a gap in communication between the @entity1 and the @entity4 undercut forecasts of the deadly flood that struck middle @entity7 in 2010 , the @entity1 reported wednesday			1
the @entity4 was forced to increase the flow of water from a dam on the @entity11 amid record rainfalls over @entity13 and the surrounding region on may 2 , according to a newly released @entity1 review of the disaster			1
but forecasters were n't told about the additional releases , and the @entity11 passed its predicted crest of 41.9 feet within two hours of their advisory , the report states			1
" if they had been able to provide that data back to the @entity1 , we could have had a better chance of producing a more accurate and timely forecast for the @entity11 , " said @entity1 meteorologist @entity22 , the report 's author			2
" but again , because of the rapid evolution of the event , we could not create that communication exchange			0
" the @entity11 eventually crested at nearly 52 feet in downtown @entity13 , nearly 12 feet over flood stage			1
the resulting flooding killed 11 people in the city and inflicted more than $ 2 billion in damages , with another 15 people killed in the surrounding region			2
both @entity22 and @entity39 , the @entity1 's director , emphasized that the communication breakdown occurred during an " unprecedented " situation , when two - day rainfall totals more than doubled their previous record			2
the @entity4 had to increase water flows at the @entity46 in @entity47 " to protect the structural integrity of this dam , " @entity22 told reporters			2
in its own november assessment , the @entity4 acknowledged that " misunderstandings " between its @entity13 district office and the @entity1 threw off forecasts " to some degree			1
" lt. col. @entity56 , the district commander , told @entity0 that the @entity1 's report was " pretty fair " and consistent with the @entity4 ' own report			1
" obviously , our normal protocols in how we would communicate were taxed , and they were taxed to a degree that we recognize that we need to improve upon , " @entity56 said			0
but , he added , " our actions and the actions of those corps employees that were out there on the spillway gates , making adjustments , saved those projects and saved lives as well			0
" the @entity4 is working on ways to share real - time data with forecasters and other agencies that need it , he said			1
@entity22 said that while the @entity1 issued flood warnings , many residents of the affected areas said they could not relate those warnings to the impact on their neighborhoods			0
as a result , she said , " @entity81 perceived that they had no warning			0
" @entity39 said the @entity1 , the @entity4 and the @entity84 have taken steps to improve communication and to learn more about each others ' operations in the wake of the event			1
and he said the service has developed forecast maps that relate predicted crests to maps , allowing residents to see a clearer picture of how far floodwaters will reach			0
" they need to know , when the river reaches 48 feet , what that will mean for their homes and businesses , " @entity22 said			0
@entity0 's @entity104 contributed to this report .			0
