@entity1 , @entity0 -- most @entity3 are probably familiar with the @entity6 slogan " @entity4			1
" ever since @entity7 brought rednecks into an alliance with hippies back in the psychedelic ' 70s , @entity1 has milked its quirky libertarian spirit for a worldwide bonanza of free publicity			1
both @entity16 and " @entity17 " were born in the cradle of this stoner plea			0
but in recent years , the @entity0 capital has become corporatized , the weirdness factor replaced by @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
yet , on christmas day , at the downtown @entity26 at the corner of @entity28 and @entity29 , vintage @entity1 weirdness came roaring back courtesy of the banned - in - @entity32 film comedy , " @entity31 , " starring @entity33 and @entity34			1
the @entity35 of the 1 p.m. showing was @entity37 , a 45 - year - old @entity38 graduate and ceo of the @entity40			1
wearing a rented star - spangled body suit , looking like the poor man 's @entity43 , a @entity46 cap festooned to his head , @entity41 orchestrated a piece of guerrilla theatrics that would have made @entity50 proud			1
striding onto the stage with @entity52 's " @entity59 " blaring from the speaker system , @entity41 introduced the bizarrely controversial " @entity31 " with a stand - up comedy routine replete with unabashed patriotism , rank silliness , vaudeville shtick and @entity58 absurdity			1
since the mid- 1990s , @entity41 , a smart businessman - cum - showman , has helped transform @entity1 from a cinema backwater to an outlaw @entity64 hub			1
determined to put the weird back into @entity1 's civic spirit , @entity41 spoofed @entity67 's damaging cyberattack against @entity68 with @entity70 aplomb			1
calling 13 audience members to the stage as pre-showtime chorus leaders , handing out free cans of @entity75 and candy , @entity41 , in tongue - and - cheek fashion , introduced a video of @entity79 crooning " @entity80			2
" the holiday moviegoers joined into a christmas carol - like singalong , collectively sounding like a patriotic @entity84 band			0
he prodded the willing audience to wave little @entity3 flags , which were handed out as souvenirs			2
he also had them hold up @entity91 lighters as if " @entity93 " were being played by @entity92			0
after this perverse round of karaoke , the main feature began , and @entity41 watched the controversial film from the aisle			0
there were no seats for him in the sold - out theater			0
" the song is the most over-the - top patriotic song i know , " @entity41 later told me			0
" @entity79 can wear that jacket and sing that song without a bit of irony			0
you got ta love that			0
" when history looks back on the whole @entity68 vs. @entity67 tempest of recent weeks , the true heroes of the saga will be @entity3 's @entity117 cinema owners			1
@entity41 , a slacker unafraid of hackers , stepped up when @entity68 and mainstream theater chains pulled the funny , low - rent satire about bumbling journalists hired by the @entity123 to assassinate @entity124			1
essentially his message to the @entity68 suits was wrapped in @entity129 sentiment : @entity40 theaters , of which he owns 19 , would never be intimidated by a punk @entity67 dictator			1
in the days before @entity133 , @entity41 networked with fellow members of @entity135 , an association of independent theater owners			0
he co-signed a group petition , delivered to @entity68 last week , urging that " @entity31 " be screened across @entity3			1
" i was disappointed that @entity68 stepped back , " he admits , but was pleased the company " regrouped " in time for @entity133			2
his only mild regret is that the film became available in the @entity3 on @entity142 , @entity143 and to the customers of @entity146 's xbox video before the @entity40 got to premiere it			1
" it made sense though , " he admits , " that @entity68 used digital outlets			2
" what impressed @entity41 about his stoked audience was the palpable unity of purpose			0
they came as patriots for a cause			0
all performances of " @entity31 " sold out instantly in a community stance supporting freedom of expression in @entity1			1
" we now consider ' the interview ' an art - house film , " he laughs , " even though it 's very far removed from typical art - house fare			1
" when i spoke with @entity41 he was beaming yuletide happiness , drinking a can of @entity169 ( an energy - alcoholic beverage he calls the " perfect @entity133 drink " )			0
we discussed his all seasons ' heroes -- @entity176 and @entity177 -- both razzle - dazzle movie promoters of a bygone era			2
by turning " @entity31 " into a happening , in ' 60s parlance , @entity41 was carrying forward the iconic @entity183 torch			2
" i 'm no stranger to wearing costumes or being patriotic , " @entity41 says			0
" and everybody who bought tickets today is a goddamn , super-duper , @entity3 hero			2
" just before " @entity31 " began , a @entity188 nostalgia swelled in the old - style theater			2
only instead of marijuana the smell of wings , popcorn and fried pickles filled the air			0
i wondered what a @entity32 spy would have thought of the orgy of jingoistic cheer and roadhouse food			0
here , in @entity1 , at a place called the @entity40 , @entity3 were defending their right to popular culture in all its spooky and kitschy guises			1
off - duty @entity1 police officers , full of holiday cheer , served as security for the showing			2
at one point , before the @entity211 video , an alarm went off			0
a firetruck rushed to the scene and determined it was an accident			0
that quick scare aside , the afternoon was a triumph of @entity133 high jinks over the @entity67 regime 's grinch - like totalitarianism			0
in its own weird way , @entity1 did @entity3 proud			1
join us on @entity224 / @entity223 .			0

@entity226 : screening of " @entity31 " in @entity0 ' capital helped " keep @entity1 weird "
he says owner of independent theaters had pushed @entity68 to reverse *decision* to shelve film
owner @entity37 wore a star - spangled body suit and @entity46 cap to introduce movie
@entity226 : @entity3 's pop culture rallied around a low - rent satire , standing up for free expression
