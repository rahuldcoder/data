-- you knew @entity2 from the small things			1
the way he chewed his cigar in the opening credits of " @entity7			0
" the way he shuffled to get his newspaper , sloppily clad in a white bathrobe			0
the way his voice changed , from a schmooze to a bark , when he talked to his psychiatrist			0
@entity19 was a master of the small things			1
" i remember telling him many times : ' you do n't get it			0
you 're like @entity27 , ' " @entity24 , who created " @entity7 , " said in a statement			0
@entity19 died wednesday night while on vacation in @entity29			1
the cause of death was not announced but was believed to be a heart attack			0
before " @entity7 , " @entity19 -- a one - time truck driver and bartender who did n't turn to acting until he was in his mid- 20s -- was a well - regarded character actor on stage and screen			1
he had a small role in the 1992 @entity40 revival of " @entity41 " with @entity42 and @entity43 , and appeared in such films as the @entity46 - written " @entity45 " ( 1993 ) , " @entity47 " ( 1995 ) and " @entity48 " ( 1998 )			2
though his roles were limited , he invested them with beauty and invention			2
but he appeared destined for a career as the supporting actor until " @entity7 " came along			0
" @entity7 " was tv on a knife 's edge			2
the @entity58 show , which put the cable network on the map for original material , could have been farce , could have been tragedy , could have been slasher film or kitchen - sink drama or gangster - movie parody			0
and , in fact , it was all these things , held together on screen by @entity19 as woebegone @entity72 chief ( or was that " waste management professional " ? ) @entity2			1
@entity2 was an unusual protagonist , especially for a television show : a violent , brutal mob boss , a beleaguered patriarch , a calculating businessman			1
it was as if " @entity78 's " @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 had been combined into one hulking bear of a figure			2
it could have been otherwise			0
opinion : @entity19 's gift to television -- and @entity86 @entity19 was one of three finalists for the role , @entity87 observed in his terrific tv history , " the revolution was televised			1
" he was chosen because , @entity24 said , " the show i envisioned is the show that 's got @entity94 in it			2
it 's a much darker show with @entity94 in it			1
" " at one time , i had said that this thing could be like a live - action ' @entity99 , ' " @entity24 told @entity97			0
" once i saw him do it , i thought , ' no , that 's not right			2
it can be absurdist , it can have a lot of stupid s * * * in it , but it should not be a live - action ' @entity99			0
' " in fact , what it became was the best - written show in tv history , according to a recent survey by the @entity113			0
many episodes were as rich as novels , or as finely wrought as a good short story			0
writing , however , will only take you so far ; you need actors to inhabit those characters			0
and with @entity19 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and so many more , " @entity7 " gave life to the scripts			1
fans can pick their favorites , but two episodes stand out for @entity19 's performances			1
one , " @entity129 , " includes a scene between him and @entity120 ( as @entity2 's wife , @entity131 ) that was as raw and painful as watching an argument between your parents			1
( if the pair had ever starred in " who 's afraid of @entity139 ? " , ticket - sellers could have made a fortune			1
) the other , " @entity145 , " features an out - of - body experience in which @entity2 -- in a coma -- imagines he 's an optics salesman named @entity144			1
here , @entity19 drops @entity148 's @entity147 accent and with it , his tough - guy veneer			1
he 's suddenly reasonable , open , somehow brighter			2
special effects foreman : " so long , paisan " it 's easy to confuse actors with their most famous roles ; with this one episode , @entity19 showed that he was no more @entity2 than he was @entity144 , but that he was playing them			1
" if anything , @entity19 often took things further than @entity158 had planned , " @entity87 wrote			1
in the pilot , a scene " called for @entity2 to slap @entity159 ( @entity160 ) lightly across the face ; instead , @entity19 picked up the smaller @entity160 to make his displeasure clear			1
" ( he worked to get himself into @entity2 's frame of mind , @entity19 told " inside the @entity171 , " as noted in the @entity168 ' obituary			1
he 'd stay up all night , put a rock in his shoe			0
" it 's silly , but it works , " he said			2
) " @entity7 " gave @entity19 fame and wealth ; he got in a contract dispute before the fifth season , eventually winning a contract worth around $ 13 million , according to a @entity180 report at the time			1
but instead of pursuing @entity183 leading roles , he immersed himself in his craft and his interests			2
he played a general in " @entity187 " and the @entity189 director in " @entity190 , " neither role showy or outsized			0
he starred in the @entity40 production of " @entity193 " and was nominated for a @entity148			0
he produced documentaries about wounded soldiers			0
@entity196 left his mark on @entity147 among his last roles was in @entity158 's little - seen " not fade away , " which came out last year			1
in it , @entity19 plays another @entity147 sad sack , this one a 1960s grocer failing to connect with his rock ' n ' roll - besotted son			1
he could have played the part as a " @entity205 " - like martinet , or a befuddled softie , or an ignorant suburban climber			0
instead , he manages to fill it with grace notes , amused one minute , frustrated the next , finally a loving father quietly handing his son some money as the boy prepares to drive away			0
he was a complicated , three - dimensional figure , and he gave the movie unexpected depth			0
@entity19 will almost certainly be best remembered for @entity2 , his role of a lifetime			1
it 's a shame that lifetime was so brief			2
the master of the small things left a legacy that looms large			0
from the mouth of @entity2 : best quotes			2

@entity19 had the role of a lifetime as @entity2
his performance made the character both darker and more *relatable* at once
@entity19 's *nuanced* acting made even his smaller roles shine
