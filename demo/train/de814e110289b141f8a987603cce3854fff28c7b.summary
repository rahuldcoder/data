-- it cost his newspaper a thumping $ 1.6 million in legal costs			0
he was the subject of vilification from both cycling fans and officials -- not to mention from a man who had become a global sporting icon			0
but not once did @entity11 waver in his quest to unveil the truth about @entity14 and his doping lies -- despite the almost insurmountable obstacles placed in his way			1
" people find this strange , but for me it was the time of my life , " @entity18 told @entity0 's @entity20 series in an interview before the start of the @entity23			2
i thought ' this was journalism , this was what our game was about ' -- asking questions that people did n't want to answer was actually the life blood of journalism for me at that time			0
" the award - winning @entity37 journalist spent 13 long and sometimes lonely years pursuing @entity14			1
labeled a " @entity40 " by the @entity39 , @entity18 was finally vindicated when the disgraced cyclist confessed earlier this year			1
it was @entity18 's finest hour and he even gained an apology from @entity14 during the course of the @entity48 's televised interview with @entity49 earlier this year			1
no elation but the 58 - year - old @entity51 did not feel any sense of real elation -- only the satisfaction of a job well done			2
" for me , it was n't a conclusion that was thrilling , or exciting , or interesting -- it was the chase , " said @entity18			2
" i 've used the expression that the hunt was better than the kill , and it very much was			0
i loved getting new information about @entity14			2
" back in 1999 , when the world was in thrall to the cancer survivor after @entity14 's remarkable comeback to win the @entity23 that year , @entity18 was immediately skeptical			1
" it was perfectly obvious to anybody with half a brain that @entity14 was cheating , " said @entity18			1
" we were told this is a clean tour , but it was the fastest in history -- completely illogical ! " @entity14 's treatment of the @entity76 rider @entity75 , who was renowned for his anti-doping stance , only served to further raise @entity18 's suspicions			1
bullying tactics " i mean , @entity14 bullied him , most of the peloton bullied him and i thought : ' if you were anti-doping , that 's not how you would treat somebody who clearly was riding clean			2
' " it was the start of a crusade to uncover the truth , though at first nobody wanted to listen			0
in the aftermath of the @entity92 -- blighted by doping , with police raiding teams to find illegal products -- cycling had been desperate for a good news story and was prepared , in @entity18 's words , to " suspend disbelief			1
" " an @entity39 guy comes from @entity48 , single - parent family , he 's come through life - threatening cancer , he 's in the lead , " explained @entity18			1
" it 's a story that could take the @entity23 from its knees and put it standing up again and the race organizers embraced that			0
" as @entity14 's winning run continued -- eventually to total an unprecedented seven @entity23 wins in a row -- so in @entity18 's view the @entity39 's web of deceit grew and he alleges others were complicit in the cover up			1
@entity18 was determined to publish his version of events and when @entity119 ( @entity14 ) @entity118 hit the bookshelves in 2004 and a story based on it was published in the @entity37 , the libel suits and the threats intensified			1
singled out @entity18 was at an explosive @entity23 media conference later that year and @entity14 , when inevitably asked about the book , singled him out , as the journalist vividly recalls			1
@entity14 said : " well as the esteemed author is here , i will answer this			2
" and then he said ' @entity131 allegations , no , extraordinary accusations must be followed by extraordinary proof			0
' everybody thought that was a great one - liner			0
" @entity18 had based his book on interviews with @entity139 , the wife of cyclist @entity140 , a former teammate of @entity14 , @entity141 , who had acted as personal masseuse for the now disgraced cyclist , and a former teammate from the 1990 's , @entity145			1
when details of the systematic doping carried out by @entity14 and his team finally emerged in a report by the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) in 2012 , it vindicated the whistleblowers ' stance -- as well as @entity18 and his co-author @entity154 @entity154			1
but back in 2004 , with @entity14 at the peak of his fame , it was inevitable he would challenge such damaging revelations to protect his reputation			1
libel action the @entity37 stood by their man and his story , but when libel action in the @entity165 courts was commenced by the litigious @entity14 , they knew the outcome would probably be in the @entity39 's favor			1
@entity18 recognized the seriousness of the situation , but admitted his judgment became clouded			2
" i 'm there saying ' well i do n't care , i just want this stuff out there			0
' " and i was n't seeing reason to be honest			0
i would have been a bit of a nightmare from the legal department 's point of view and they were right			0
" it did cost the @entity37 a million pounds , but the newspaper were tremendously supportive as was my sports editor , " added @entity18 , referring to the out - of - court settlement reached with @entity14 in 2006			1
by then the @entity48 had retired from the sport for the first time , though the rumors would not go away			0
ultimate responsibility @entity18 believes that cycling 's governing body -- the @entity188 -- bears a heavy responsibility for not cleaning up its own sport in the face of overwhelming evidence of doping , not just by @entity14 but other leading riders			1
he is heavily critical of its chiefs past and present , @entity198 , who resigned in 2005 to be replaced by @entity199			0
" they were the people whose ultimate responsibility it was to ensure that the riders riding clean were protected			0
they did n't do their job , " said @entity18			2
" @entity199 said he was very anti-doping , but he did n't want to find out the truth about @entity14			2
he wanted basically , to sweep it under the carpet , and in my opinion , his organization now can not have any credibility as long as he 's president			0
" @entity18 's fellow @entity211 has a different perspective			2
" hindsight is an exact science and hindsight is 20 - 20 vision , " @entity199 told @entity0 as part of the @entity20 series			0
" of course you would do things differently but that does n't mean that i regret anything that i did			0
" many , many federations around the world told me that under no circumstances should i contemplate resigning , " added @entity199 defiantly			0
@entity199 is being challenged for the top job at the @entity188 by @entity228 's @entity227 , and @entity18 , while not specifically backing any candidate , is convinced a change is urgently needed			1
" i have been saying this since the whole controversy unfolded -- the people who were in charge during this fiasco , should n't still be there			0
" if cycling could find a credible candidate within its own ranks to take over from @entity199 , it would immediately change the perception of the @entity188 and people would say ' you know what ? let 's give this new guy a chance			0
" and let him reassure us that anti-doping really is going to be the number one item on the agenda			0
" ringleader @entity14 came out of retirement in 2009 to ride for the @entity257 team and finished third in that year 's @entity23			2
he raced two more years with @entity258 with diminishing success before quitting in early 2011			0
by then he was the subject of a @entity39 federal investigation into doping allegations and more former teammates , notably @entity264 and @entity265 , came forward to specifically implicate the @entity48 as the ringleader			1
once again , @entity18 had been ahead of the game , having published from @entity14 to @entity265 : inside the @entity268 at the @entity23 in 2007			1
the federal case against @entity14 was eventually dropped , but the @entity270 persisted in its investigations			2
grilling his former teammates and other close connections , the @entity151 formally charged @entity14 in june 2012 with using illicit performance - enhancing drugs in " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen			1
" @entity18 , who has won a string of press awards , was finally vindicated as he recounts in his book @entity281 : my pursuit of @entity14			1
new era for the first time since 2004 , @entity18 will cover the @entity23 after @entity165 's @entity286 , who won the @entity23 last year with @entity288 , gave the journalist exclusive behind the scenes access to the 2013 race			1
" i 'm really looking forward to it , but i 'm looking forward to it because i feel that the @entity14 era has been dealt with and we can start again , " said the @entity51			1
" we can start tentatively believing in some of what we see , and that 's why i 'm back			0
" not that @entity18 believes the doping culture in cycling has been completely eradicated and points to last year 's race where @entity302 's @entity301 fell foul of the testers			1
" the one certainty is that @entity301 was n't the only guy who doped in last year 's @entity23 , " said @entity18			2
" that 's absolutely certain			0
" nobody of sane mind would believe that the people who get caught are the only people who dope			0
" @entity18 has spent four weeks in total with @entity286 as they prepared for this year 's tour where @entity313 , second last year to @entity314 , who will be absent this time , is regarded the favorite			1
the journalist has had to soak up some criticism on @entity318 that he has become a " pr agency for @entity286 " but @entity18 remains unabashed			2
" they say they 're clean			0
i 've seen nothing to make me suspicious that they 're telling a lie when they say they 're clean , though that does n't mean that things could n't be happening behind my back			0
" the conclusion i 've come to given the time i 've spent with them is that they certainly do n't have an organized doping program within the team			0
