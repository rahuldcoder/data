@entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity20 has crept back into our consciousness lately with synchronized bomb attacks that took the lives of 76 people in the nation 's capital @entity27 during the @entity29 festivities			1
when we were last in @entity27 , we set out to learn more about the desperate fight for the survival of mountain gorillas			2
with a dwindling population of 700 , they have been victims of poaching , disease , war , civil unrest , slaughter and displacement			1
under pressure from rebel factions in @entity20 and the @entity44 who massacred gorillas because the conservationists were " getting on their nerves , " our guide tracks the remaining apes -- by armpit stench and dung -- to keep tabs on their health			1
we traveled to the remote jungle area known as @entity19 in the southwestern part of @entity20 , bordering with @entity57 and the @entity44 , areas plagued with dictatorships , genocide and decades of civil and national wars			1
ten years earlier , eight park visitors had been abducted and then murdered by a group of @entity57 armed rebels in an effort to destabilize the region			0
the drive from @entity27 was harrowing			0
our driver sped and swerved obsessively , overtaking anyone in his path despite on - coming traffic			0
we witnessed three traffic accidents , two fatalities and an adventurous couple having sex in the middle of a dark mountain road after midnight			0
with four guards armed with machetes and rifles , two advance gorilla trackers , and our guide @entity83 we ventured into the dense tropical rainforest that is home to roughly half of the 700 remaining mountain gorillas in the world			1
here we encountered the gentle beasts and found out more about their plight			0
