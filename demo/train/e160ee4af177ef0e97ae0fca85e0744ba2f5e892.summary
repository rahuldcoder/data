@entity0 -- the chairman of the @entity3 said tuesday that the situation in the wake of the @entity7 nuclear reactor crisis is static but not yet stable			1
on the day that @entity7 bumped up the seriousness of its nuclear accident from a @entity12 to a @entity14 priority , on par with the @entity16 , a @entity9 committee heard from @entity18 environmental officials , scientists and @entity3 chairman @entity20			1
" from the information we have , we believe the situation currently is static , namely we do n't see significant changes on a day - to - day basis with the reactors , " @entity20 told the @entity21			1
" it is not yet , however , what we believe to be stable : namely that given additional events or other circumstances ... there would not be the potential for significant additional problems at the reactors			2
" thus , @entity20 said , the focus is " on these efforts to transition from static to stable to ensure ( the ) long - term ... ability to cool the reactors and to provide cooling for the spent fuel pools			1
" @entity42 sen. @entity41 's state has a number of nuclear plants in areas with high seismic activity near millions of people			1
she pressed @entity20 for reassurances that enough is being done to protect people in the @entity18 , especially @entity42 residents			1
" we 've got to move beyond talk and get to the serious question ( of ) what do we do , to do everything in our power to make it safe , " @entity41 said			2
@entity41 pointed out that officials once said it was " very unlikely " @entity7 would ever face the kind of crisis it finds itself in today			2
questions were raised at the hearing about how far to extend evacuation zones in the @entity18 in the event of a nuclear incident			1
the @entity3 has recommended that @entity18 in @entity7 stay at least 50 miles away from the damaged reactors			1
the current standard in the @entity18 is a 10 - mile evacuation zone			1
" as we 've seen in @entity7 , nuclear events tend to develop over a long period of time , " said @entity20			2
" this is three weeks into this event , and we 've had the time and the ability to make protective action recommendations , and to update and modify them as conditions of the plant changed			0
so that 10 miles is really based around the idea of what do you need to have prepared right away so that if you have an event that develops quickly , you can address that and have prestaged and prepared what to do , " he said			0
@entity41 pointed out that two of the nuclear plants in @entity42 were built to withstand a certain level of earthquake , pointing out in @entity7 it was 7.5 but the devastating quake was much more powerful			2
she said nuclear regulatory officials are being too conservative			0
" it 's eerie to me , because i do n't sense enough humility from all of us here			0
you know , as some great scientists once said , we think we have all the answers , but @entity98 may not agree with us			0
so a lot of what you 're saying is the same thing that they said , " @entity41 pointed out			0
" you ca n't know for sure what 's going to happen , " she said			0
@entity106 , administrator for the @entity107 , reassured senators that air and water sampling for radiation contamination continue in the @entity18 and that so far there is nothing to worry about			0
" let me be clear , @entity107 has not seen and does not expect to see radiation in our air or water reaching harmful levels in the @entity18 , " said @entity114			0
" all of the data that we have seen , which we continue to make public and available on our website , indicates that while radiation levels are slightly elevated in some places , they are significantly below problematic levels			0
