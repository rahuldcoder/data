@entity0 -- imagine paying as much for water as you do for your mortgage			1
residents throughout @entity0 are outraged by hundreds , even thousands of dollars in monthly spikes in their water bills , and have questioned the legitimacy of the charges for years			1
now , they 're demanding answers			0
" i thought we were sinking in a hole of water , " said @entity11			1
" it scared me to death			0
i thought we had a major leak when i got the bill			2
" over two months last summer , her family 's monthly water bill , shot up to $ 1,805 in july and then $ 1,084 in august , leaving a balance due of more than $ 3,000			1
she said in the past her bill has averaged $ 200 to $ 250			1
" i 'm not paying a $ 3,000 bill			1
and for those three months , we were pretty much out of town most of the time and there 's no leaks , " she said , showing @entity1 a copy of her plumber 's report			0
the city installed a device on her meter to track daily usage			2
in the meantime , @entity37 's bill remains unpaid while she disputes the charges			2
while similar complaints about huge water bill spikes have popped up in @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 ; @entity47 , @entity48 ; and @entity49 , @entity50 ; it appears that the issue has lasted the longest in @entity0			1
see how top 50 cities rank it 's led to a class - action lawsuit , countless meetings with city officials and continuing complaints from fed - up residents			1
thousands of residents who have seen unusual spikes have appealed their high water bills			1
just last year , the city issued credits totaling $ 466,368 to customers			1
@entity0 , with more than 500,000 residents , says it already has the highest water rates of any major city in the @entity68 , due in part to federal consent decrees to overhaul the city 's water supply infrastructure			1
many of the problems arose after the installation of new , automated water meters , which began nearly five years ago , and involved contracts for meter installations , the electronic meters and software equipment			1
the automated meter - reading technology eliminates the need for city workers to manually check every meter			1
instead , they retrieve the data by driving by each property			0
the meter electronically transmits data showing the amount of water used			2
from the beginning , there were problems			2
in 2007 , city auditors found they were " unable to verify electronic meter readings " because of " meter read errors , equipment failures or human errors			2
" specifically , the audit said " about 9 % of the meters could not be read due to broken or malfunctioning equipment			2
" two years later , another audit concluded that a " high number of accounts " were not getting " actual meter readings " because of " meter read errors , equipment failures or human errors			0
" @entity1 reviewed hundreds of complaints from @entity0 residents as well as city e-mails obtained through a public records request			1
on august 26 , 2010 , @entity112 , a sales executive of @entity113 , which manufactured the meters , wrote to a city official : " it has been an industry experience that typically when a utility does an @entity119 ( automatic meter reading ) meter changeout and also switches software billing companies that generally high bill complaints are either due to new meter accuracy and / or a billing multiplier error			1
" @entity112 would not comment , referring @entity1 to city officials			1
@entity125 , the city of @entity0 's chief operating officer , said in an interview that he realized at that time the situation was serious			1
he 's been on the job since january 2010			2
last september , he replaced senior management in the @entity132 of @entity133			0
he said the city has sampled about 9,000 of the 132,954 residential meters and made a major discovery : about 1 % of the meters ' registers , which show how much water is being used , and the meter base underneath do not properly fit			1
that mismatch could result in a doubling of the water bill , @entity125 said			1
" these two components do n't match and guess what ? they 're labeled			0
this one says three - quarter ( inch ) on it and this one has a " 1 " ( inch ) on it			0
now , it 's small print but it 's big enough to see , " @entity125 said			0
that would explain a billing multiplier error , which leads to higher bills , he said			0
he added that the problem was first " identified in the audit back in ( 2007 ) and [ the city ] put in place , or were supposed to put in place , a whole system of checks and balances as they went through the rest of the system upgrade , and clearly they failed because we 're still finding these mismatches out there			2
" experts : @entity68 water infrastructure in trouble operators of @entity176 and @entity177 , two large shopping malls , complained about water billings " nearly $ 300,000 over last year for this same period of time , " according to another e-mail			1
" there appears to be serious errors in the water billings that are creating huge hardships for both centers , " wrote @entity182 , regional vice president of @entity183			2
" we need the city 's full attention to correct the problem			2
" the city responded by changing the meters ' registers			1
@entity182 did not return calls to check whether the bills had gone back to normal , but there are no follow - up complaints in the city records supplied to @entity1			1
asked about problems with the rest of the meters , @entity125 said , " the majority of the people who complain about high water bills have some issue that is not associated with the meter			1
many , many of them have either leaks , or increases in usage through irrigation or pool filling that they did n't fully understand the impact of , but that 's not to minimize the fact that we do have some cases of meters that are n't functioning properly			2
and we 're addressing those on a case - by - case basis and giving people their money back			0
to me , the story here is there has been a complete loss of trust between the city and its citizens and its customers			0
" the city has not found issues with meter manufacturer @entity232 or @entity234 which installed the billing software , @entity125 said			0
executives at both companies declined interview requests			0
two other contractors that installed meters at commercial locations did not return calls			1
" we have not found a smoking gun , if you will , in terms of a system problem , " @entity125 told @entity1			0
however , he said the company that installed the residential meters should be held accountable			0
@entity250 , an @entity0 - based firm , joined a @entity253 company to carry out the $ 40.3 million contract			1
after months of calls , @entity256 president @entity255 agreed to an interview , but only after @entity1 had spoken to @entity125			0
" when we ended the contract in december of 2009 , we had a 90 - day window to come in and address any concerns			0
no concerns were brought to us			0
so as of today sitting here with you , it is our understanding that the meters are functioning properly as they were supposed to when we installed them , " @entity255 said			0
he said the company had identified 968 meters that had the mismatching problem , and fixed all of them by last march			0
the project , he said , was " very successful " and he added that he had not been informed about additional meter issues			0
asked if his company would repair any other meters the city said were not correctly installed , @entity255 told @entity1 , " if it is our problem , we will do that			1
" meanwhile , @entity0 residents continue to complain to the city , which received more than 22,000 calls to its @entity283 in january			1
and last year alone , there were a total of 12,291 water bill disputes , according to the city			1
" clearly , people are upset , and one of the things that we said to people is that we hear you and that we do believe we have problems in the water meter and billing system , " @entity125 said			1
that does n't convince residents like @entity299 , who is astounded at a water bill that now totals $ 10,071			1
her bill spiked to more than $ 1,200 in november , then skyrocketed to $ 6,879 in december			2
" i am furious , i am upset , i 'm confused , " @entity299 said			0
" i ca n't get an answer from the city because they wo n't admit there is a problem			0
" a city official reviewed @entity299 's bills , and said the unusually high usage for the two months would normally mean there was some kind of leak , possibly with the irrigation system			0
the city installed a data logger meter that tracks usage during each day			0
her latest bill is down to just $ 34			2
ironically , @entity299 knows something about water issues			0
she 's an attorney for the @entity321			0
" as i person , i know something 's wrong here , " @entity299 said			0
" as an attorney , what can i do about it ? but , i do n't think it takes a law degree to say $ 7,000 for a month 's use of water by one person in a small home is just crazy without a leak			2
