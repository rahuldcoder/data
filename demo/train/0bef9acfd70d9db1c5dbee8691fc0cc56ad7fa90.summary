-- " @entity5 " returns for a fifth season on @entity3 , and fans have been waiting since march to find out the fate of @entity7 and many of the survivors			1
last season ended with the group having discovered a place called @entity13 , which was anything but the sanctuary they were led to believe it was			2
the residents of @entity13 quickly locked them in a train car , but @entity7 was determined to make an escape with his friends			1
@entity0 spoke with executive producer @entity22 about what 's to come on one of tv 's most popular ( and secretive ) shows			1
@entity0 : the survivors were in a lot of danger at the end of the season			1
do things move at a quick pace as the season begins ? @entity22 : you can get a sense of the pacing and the scope from the promos that we 've released			1
we 've never left our group of survivors before , in such perilous circumstances			2
we pick up pretty much where we left off , which is also new for us			2
@entity0 : they 're in a new situation with @entity13			2
are we going to see a lot of changes this season ? @entity22 : yes			1
the prison has been left behind			2
they 've been on the road			2
some are still on the road , like @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
@entity57 seems to be in jeopardy as well			0
we have multiple strands of stories that we 're telling in different settings			0
@entity0 : can we expect a big body count coming up ? @entity22 : sadly , this is a world in which we tend not to make it to the end with the same characters intact			1
we ca n't imagine that this season will be any different			1
@entity0 : we 've had a lot of human threats lately , as opposed to the walkers			0
is that going to continue ? @entity22 : it is the zombie apocalypse , and the loss of society , civilization , and law and order has enabled all of this to take place			1
they find themselves in that world , and they have to adapt or die			0
we see the journey that each character takes , they 're all different as to how they adapt , and how they can reconcile the terrible things they 've done			0
or perhaps they turn evil as the governor did			0
@entity0 : is there a particular character we should keep an eye on this season ? @entity22 : as always , @entity7 goes through a great number of changes , and has over the season			1
last season , he threw down a gauntlet , saying that the people of @entity13 had no idea who they 're dealing with -- which is quite a threat considering that they 're locked in a train car			1
but it shows that he 's embraced the mantle of leadership that he tried to throw off in the previous seasons			0
@entity54 's journey has been incredibly remarkable , and it will continue to be so			0
@entity0 : five seasons in , are there things that continue to surprise you about this world ? @entity22 : @entity120 's underlying comic book continues to surprise me , and it 's an inspiration for all of us who work on the show			1
in some ways , we hew closely to it , in others we vary greatly			0
but it 's also something of a road map for us			0
@entity3 grabs ' @entity132 pilot			0
