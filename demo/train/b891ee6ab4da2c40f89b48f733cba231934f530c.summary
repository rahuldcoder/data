-- when @entity2 took the stage at the annual @entity5 convention tuesday , he had a chance to finally offer serious ideas for strengthening @entity9 foreign policy and how , if elected president , he would keep our nation secure			1
he did n't take it			0
missing yet another opportunity to show meaningful leadership , the former @entity16 governor instead chose to offer more empty rhetoric cloaked in patriotic bravado			1
his campaign appears more focused on mocking the successful foreign policy of president @entity23 , who has undoubtedly made @entity9 safer , than on revealing exactly how a @entity2 administration would engage with the world			1
refusing to acknowledge our nation 's recent successes in global leadership , @entity2 again on tuesday pivoted to the shallow rhetoric at the core of his campaign : boasts of @entity9 exceptionalism with no mention of partnership with our allies ; promises of radically increased military spending without clarity about its mission ; and provocative language toward countries such as @entity45 and @entity46 that even a member of his own party has criticized			1
@entity2 camp disavows anonymous quote in @entity50 paper tuesday 's speech served as a clear reminder of why @entity2 so rarely speaks of national security , which is normally a sacred and central issue for @entity55 candidates			2
perhaps it 's because when he does , he says things such as " @entity46 is our no. 1 geopolitical foe			0
" @entity2 has done little to show he has the judgment and vision to lead and protect this nation in a dangerous world			0
he seems to know it , too , and has surrounded himself with an array of @entity68 administration veterans , most of whom are best known for their roles in sending the @entity9 into a war in @entity73 that has cost this nation trillions of dollars and the lives of 4,488 brave members of the @entity9 military			1
roughly 70 % of @entity2 's foreign policy team comes from the @entity68 / @entity79 neo-con all - star team			1
his few foreign policy quips on the stump and his unwillingness to stand apart from the @entity68 administration 's high - profile failures raise serious questions about the direction he would lead @entity9 foreign policy as president			1
so far during this campaign , @entity2 has threatened a trade war with @entity45 and has vowed to increase the military 's budget by a staggering $ 2.1 trillion over the next 10 years , although he wo n't say how he 'll pay for it or what he 'll do with the additional spending			2
he has repeatedly criticized @entity23 's plan to bring @entity9 forces home from @entity99 by 2014 , only to eventually endorse that strategy in his speech tuesday			2
is @entity2 getting @entity102 - boated ? @entity2 has said he 'd simply refuse to negotiate with the @entity103 and instead would pursue and target each of its members across the world			0
that 's a strategy that even @entity68 's national security adviser , @entity109 , has said is a bad idea			0
@entity2 's record of reckless rhetoric stands in sharp contrast with @entity23 's successful foreign policy and national security strategy -- one that does n't rely solely on strong military action but smartly invests in diplomacy and development and focuses on real threats instead of political convenience			1
under @entity23 's leadership , we have destroyed @entity125 's leadership and ended @entity127 's reign of terror			0
@entity23 has fulfilled his promise to get @entity9 forces out of @entity73 and set a course out of @entity99 , wisely focusing @entity9 resources on more urgent threats to our national security			2
he has stood firmly by our friend , @entity135 , deepening our defense and security partnership and taking strong steps to deter @entity139 from developing a nuclear weapons capability			0
he has repaired our alliances and restored @entity9 's standing and credibility in the world -- as a leader not only in force but in values			0
@entity2 calls for a change in hearts , not gun laws without question , @entity23 , vice president @entity151 and secretary of state @entity152 have made our country safer			0
they have led a national security strategy that is wisely cautious and stands in sharp contrast with @entity2 's wildly dangerous rhetoric			2
if @entity2 has any serious ideas about how to make the @entity9 safer , now is the time for him to offer them			0
if he is to lead our country , or even just his party , @entity2 must move past applause lines and catch up to a world that has moved on from @entity166 - style fear mongering and feckless grandstanding			1
voters should demand better from a man who would be president			0
@entity2 walks political tightrope on foreign policy the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			1

@entity174 : @entity2 's speech was empty rhetoric cloaked in patriotic bravado
@entity174 : he promises radically increased military spending without clarity about mission
@entity2 's foreign policy team , he writes , are @entity68 / @entity79 *neocons* who got @entity9 into @entity73
@entity174 : @entity2 must move past applause lines and stop @entity166 - style fear mongering
