@entity9 is legally obliged to arrest @entity11 and hand him over to the @entity5 , a court representative told @entity0			1

the @entity5 issued its second arrest warrant @entity11 just last week			2
the court added three new counts of genocide to the already existing charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity			1

@entity48 wednesday called on @entity9 to arrest the @entity3 leader			1
" @entity9 should not shield president @entity11 from international justice , " the rights group 's senior legal advisor @entity50 said			1
" his visit to @entity9 is an opportunity to enforce the arrest warrant and send a message that justice will prevail			0
" @entity59 secretary general ban ki - moon said through a spokesman that it was up to countries that are party to the court " to live up to their obligations as they see fit			1

his information minister dismissed the @entity5 as a " white man 's tribunal			0
" adding genocide to the list of charges against @entity11 could affect the length of his sentence if he is ever tried and convicted			1
the @entity92 this year urged the court to delay war crimes proceedings against @entity3 's president , saying a decision allowing genocide charges harms efforts to bring peace to @entity18			1

@entity115 appealed in july , saying that the judges ' standard of proof for adding the genocide charge was too high			0
the appellate court agreed with @entity115 and ruled in his favor			0
@entity11 has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued , even though any country that is party to the @entity5 has an obligation to hand him over to @entity131 in the @entity132 , the court says			2
it is not clear whether he has been in a country that is a party to the court since the arrest warrant was issued			0

the @entity59 estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in @entity18 and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes			1

the militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength			0
