@entity0 , @entity1 -- police in @entity1 summarily execute prisoners , torture and threaten suspects and arrest people without reason , a leading rights group said tuesday			1
@entity10 says individial officers are not to blame for abuses			1
@entity1 's police have largely failed to evolve from the repressive forces they were designed to be under @entity17 's colonial regime , according to a new report by the @entity19 - based @entity10			1
" while 60 years later , much of @entity1 is in the process of rapid modernization , the police continue to use their old methods , " the group said			1
officials at the @entity26 -- which is responsible for the police -- offered no immediate comment			2
the report cited abuse and threats as a primary tactic for investigating crime and enforcing the law in @entity1			2
it said the system rather than individual officers or commanders was partly to blame			0
" the institutional culture of police practically discourages officers from acting otherwise , failing to give them the resources , training , ethical environment and encouragement to develop professional police tactics , " it said			0
the @entity26 will study the report before responding , said @entity50 , its deputy secretary dealing with human rights issues , but some former police officers agreed that the force had yet to modernize			0
@entity54 , former police commissioner of @entity0 and head of an association of retired officers from the @entity1 capital , charged that almost all @entity1 states had been reluctant to carry out police reforms			1
state chief ministers , he said , had rejected any moves aimed at granting greater autonomy to the police for fear it would loosen their control over the force			0
" the police inherited a colonial legacy			2
in the last 60 years or so , they should have come out of it , but this has n't happened			0
what has happened is that @entity17 masters have been replaced by @entity1 masters , " @entity54 remarked			2
the legal basis for much of @entity1 's state and federal police services is a law dating back to 1861 , which was drafted in the wake of an 1857 uprising against @entity17 rule			1
@entity1 gained its independence from @entity17 in 1947			2
@entity54 said a national police commission had recommended scrapping the 1861 law some 30 years ago , but said it had not been acted upon except for what he called " small changes			0
" @entity89 serving officers from @entity91 and @entity92 , states @entity10 used for its field research , refused comment on the report			1
" i have to study it first , " @entity92 police chief @entity95 said			0
@entity97 , additional director general of police in @entity91 , gave the same response			0
successive governments for decades have failed to deliver on promises to hold the police accountable for abuses and to build professional , rights - respecting police forces , @entity10 said			1
" colonial - era police laws enable state and local politicians to interfere routinely in police operations , sometimes directing police officers to drop investigations against people with political connections , including known criminals , and to harass or file false charges against political opponents , " it added			1
moreover , abysmal conditions for police officers also contribute to violations , the report noted			0
low - ranking officers often work in difficult conditions and are required to be on - call 24 hours a day , every day , it said			0
" they often lack necessary equipment , including vehicles , mobile phones , investigative tools and even paper on which to record complaints and make notes , " the @entity10 said			0
the 118 - page report , " @entity133 : dysfunction , @entity143 and impunity in the @entity1 @entity145 , " is based on interviews with more than 80 police officers of varying ranks , 60 people who said they were victims of police abuse , and numerous discussions with experts and civil society activists			1
" it 's time for the government to stop talking about reform and fix the system , " said @entity146 , @entity10 's @entity147 director , in a statement .			2
