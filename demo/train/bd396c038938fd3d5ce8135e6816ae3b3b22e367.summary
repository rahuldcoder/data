democrat @entity0 has a slight 47 % -44 % edge over @entity3 @entity2 in the @entity5 race for an open @entity7 seat , according to a new @entity10 / @entity9 survey released friday			1
the three - point margin falls within the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points , meaning the two candidates are statistically tied less than two weeks before @entity17			0
if neither candidate garners 50 % of the vote , the race heads to a january runoff			2
analysis : will last minute strength be enough for @entity24 ? @entity24 are throwing a lot of money in @entity5 , as the party hopes to thwart what 's widely expected to be a strong year for @entity7 republicans and their quest to take control of the @entity7			0
the @entity3 needs to win a net six seats to win the majority			2
libertarian candidate @entity34 is pulling 5 % of the vote in @entity5 , keeping @entity0 and @entity2 from reaching the 50 % threshold			2
poll : @entity7 race statistically tied a @entity40 candidate is also peeling off votes in @entity5 's contested gubernatorial race between @entity3 incumbent gov. @entity43 and @entity24 challenger , @entity45 , the grandson of former president @entity46			1
@entity47 makes push for @entity0 on @entity49 radio the @entity10 / @entity9 poll , conducted by telephone october 19 - 22 with 565 likely voters , indicates @entity46 has a 48 % -46 % advantage over @entity54 , while @entity40 candidate @entity55 gets 6 % support			1
in the @entity7 race , @entity10 director @entity57 said @entity0 's ability to make the race competitive in a reliably red state -- no @entity0 has won a statewide election in more than a decade -- is a surprising show of strength			1
" the @entity5 electorate appears to be the most pro-obama group of likely voters in the 11 states @entity10 has surveyed this fall , " @entity57 said			0
" that 's not saying much -- @entity47 's approval rating among @entity5 likely voters is only 44 %			0
but that 's still better than the high - 30s he gets in states like @entity75 and @entity76 , not to mention the low 30s in @entity78 and @entity79			0
" @entity81 's midterm campaign schedule @entity0 has a particular advantage over @entity2 among likely women voters , 56 % -38 % , and among likely voters who live in the all - important suburbs that dominate much of the state 's political scene , @entity57 added			1
in a hypothetical runoff , @entity0 still holds a small margin over @entity2 , 51 % to 47 %			1
but the poll 's likely voter model can only estimate the november electorate , as a runoff election can draw a smaller and different crowd than the general election .			0

democrat @entity0 has a small 47 % -44 % edge over @entity3 @entity2 .
that 's according to a new @entity10 / @entity9 survey
if @entity0 wins , she *'d* be the first @entity0 elected statewide in more than a decade
the gubernatorial race between gov. @entity43 and @entity106 @entity45 is also close
