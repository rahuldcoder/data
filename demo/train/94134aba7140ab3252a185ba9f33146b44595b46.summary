-- there are a ton of old sayings about music : that it 's the food of love , that it soothes the savage beast , that it makes the people come together ( yeah )			1
and for good reason : over the years , music has remained one of the few things , genres notwithstanding , that most people can agree to enjoy			1
however , just as genres and sounds have twisted and changed over the years ( just watch these elderly folks listening to @entity21 for proof ) the way we listen to , consume and integrate music into our daily lives has also shifted and altered			2
now , with the advent of the @entity25 and advances in technology , music can occupy every corner of our mundane existence -- like a particularly pungent cooking odor , but in a good way			2
that 's why this week , we 're going to highlight a passel of helpful music apps that do more than just , well , allow you to listen to music			1
instead , they help your mood , your schedule and even your love life			2
all of these apps live on @entity44 's new app platform , a whole new world of services built by developers within the streaming - music service 's desktop client			1
so stop merely listening to music			2
it 's time to live it , too			2
1 ) @entity53 everything sucks			1
you twisted your ankle , broke a plate , tripped on the curb , walked past a black cat , smashed a mirror , ripped your pants , had a fight with your boyfriend , contracted an @entity64 ( the reason for the aforementioned fight ) and lost your job ( did we mention your boyfriend was your boss ? )			0
how , oh how , are you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps out of the doldrums and myriad other cliches ? well , it 's an oft - bandied - about assertion that smiling makes you happy , so why not find a way to add some twitch to the sides of your lips with @entity44 app @entity53 ? when you fire up the app , you can pick from an array of playlist moods -- @entity82 -- or search for a song that evokes a certain mood and create a mix of similar tunes			1
oh , and although many kitten posters say laughter is the best medicine , maybe after lightening your mood , you should also hit up your doctor			0
2 ) @entity93 when seapunk emerged from the briny depths of the @entity96 a mere handful of months ago , you felt that that you were finally whole			1
you immediately went out and purchased a bottle of blue hair dye and various and sundry jaunty nautically themed vestments from your local @entity101 and soon thereafter created a @entity102 replete with @entity104 / @entity103			0
however , although your heart had been recently revivicated by that most viral of electronica currents , it still felt empty -- because you had no one with whom to share your oceanic ardor			0
lucky for you , @entity44 has an app for that ( sorry , we really need to retire that phrase )			0
@entity93 is a handy dating / friend - making tool on @entity44 's platform that scans your library to help you find lovers and friends who share your taste in tunes			1
see ? there 's plenty of fish in the sea ( punk )			0
3 ) @entity128 the other week , an op - ed in the @entity130 headlined " the ' @entity138 " got the @entity25 buzzing about its assertion that people are so busy nowadays because society forces us to be that way / to stave off the crushing emptiness that inactivity breeds			0
no matter which side you take on the issue ( " no ! i 'm busy because i 'm an important cat video - finder ! " or " you 're right			0
... my soul would be black and empty if my schedule was likewise " ) , we can all agree that we sometimes miss our favorite bands when they come through town due to said busy - ness			0
that 's where @entity149 comes in			1
this @entity44 app scans your music library to provide you with a handy timeline of bands coming through your hood , along with links to the best ticket prices			1
so give it a download and fill your heart void with live music instead of overtime .			0

@entity53 lets a user pick music according to a mood
@entity93 helps find other users who share music taste
@entity149 shows when bands are coming to a user 's area
