while attorney general @entity4 had made clear that he wanted to leave the post before the end of @entity8 's second term , the announcement of his departure just before midterm elections took many by surprise and the timing could complicate the effort to replace him			1
choosing a new attorney general and getting approval in a @entity16 confirmation hearing will be difficult for the @entity17			1
while the list of strong candidates who could assume the role is long , congressional politics will make it difficult to get @entity16 approval for just about anyone			0
plus , while he has endured his share of controversies , @entity4 is also president @entity8 's very close friend and confidant , someone for whom the president consistently communicated his full support			1
" we have been great colleagues , but the bonds between us are much deeper than that , " @entity4 said thursday in a joint statement with @entity8 , announcing his departure			1
" i 'm proud to call you my friend			0
" when a replacement might be announced is unknown			0
@entity8 thanked @entity4 for his service thursday but offered no timeline for announcing a nominee to replace him			1
@entity4 pledged to stay on the job until a nominee is selected and confirmed by the @entity16 , and in doing that , he might have agreed to stay on for a while longer			0
who could replace @entity4 as attorney general ? the @entity16 is the biggest obstacle			1
@entity4 's announcement comes just weeks before the midterm elections , in which republicans have a solid chance of reclaiming the majority			2
@entity53 , currently on recess while members campaign for re-election , will have a lame duck session in november and december in which a confirmation hearing could be pushed through			0
but @entity53 will have a lot on its plate during that session , most notably a possible vote to expand @entity8 's authority to execute his military offensive against @entity65			0
it 's possible that a confirmation hearing will take place in the next @entity53 , in 2015 , when @entity50 could be in control			0
@entity17 officials insisted they were n't concerned about this possibility			2
" i do anticipate that @entity74 will hold the @entity16 , " @entity17 press secretary @entity72 told reporters thursday			0
" that said , i also anticipate that whoever the nominee is will earn and ultimately receive bipartisan support			2
" but in the current political climate , bipartisan support is far from certain for any administration appointee , particularly one as high profile as @entity4 's replacement			1
the other issue is less tactical -- it 's the personal factor			0
@entity8 and @entity4 are good friends , and @entity4 is a part of the @entity8 inner circle that includes key adviser @entity87 , whom @entity4 thanked thursday as someone who he had " been fortunate to work with since the beginning of what started as an improbable , idealistic effort by a young senator from @entity93			2
" furthermore , the issues that @entity4 has championed -- voting rights , lgbt rights and reducing prison sentences for low - level drug offenders -- are important aspects of @entity8 's legacy , so this pick will , in all likelihood , be an incredibly important one for him			2
@entity8 gave no hints about possible replacements in his goodbye remarks to @entity4 , offering only a tidbit of what he 's looking for in an attorney general : " i chose him to serve as attorney general because he believes , as i do , that justice is not just an abstract theory -- it 's a living and breathing principle			1
