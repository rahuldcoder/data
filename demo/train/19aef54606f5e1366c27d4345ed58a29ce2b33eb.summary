@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity0 sun is high when the bare - chested young men step onto the carefully manicured pitch , draped in flowing red cloaks and several layers of colorful beads			1
a few years ago they had n't even held a cricket ball , let alone played in a competitive match , yet here they are today , entering the game 's most famous venue to a flurry of cheers			2
from a remote corner in @entity18 to @entity20 's cricket ground in the @entity21 , known as the spiritual home of cricket , it 's been a long journey for the @entity25 , a team of young tribesmen attending " last man stands , " a global championship event for amateur squads from around the world			1
it all started six years ago thanks to the efforts of @entity33 , a @entity34 woman who 'd gone to @entity18 's @entity36 region to work on a primate research program			2
whilst studying the behavior of baboons , @entity33 was finding it hard to live without her big love : cricket			2
" i was missing my passion and i just wanted to share it with others , " says @entity33 , who is now the team 's coach			2
" @entity47 is a fabulous medium to build friendships and to engage people in a positive way			2
" ' love for the game ' @entity33 then decided to introduce cricket to the local community			0
she brought some basic cricket equipment from @entity34 and held a trial session outside the @entity60 village chief 's office			0
" i just invited anybody who wanted to come , " she remembers			0
" a few kids came along and then i approached the head teacher of the local school and asked him if it was possible to go twice a week and train the kids			0
" read this : @entity69 boy scares off lions with flashy invention but along with the school children 's attention , these initial sessions also captured the imagination of some of the young @entity69 warriors living nearby			1
every time they 'd pass the training ground they would stop and watch curiously until one day some of them decided , just for the fun of it , to have a go at this novel game themselves			0
" it was the first time to see this kind of a game because in @entity18 cricket is not famous , " says team captain @entity87			1
" at that time it was more like just fun , but when we went on playing and training , we found out that we were starting to love the game			0
" ' just like throwing a spear ' @entity87 , 24 , says that cricket came naturally to him and his fellow @entity69 warriors			1
" @entity100 , it was n't hard for us , " explains the formidably built captain			0
" i can relate it to the cultural way , the @entity69 way , the way we throw the spear , " he adds			1
" we are pastoralists , we keep animals and sometimes you encounter a wild animal , so if you throw the spear trying to protect yourself from the wild animal , then that 's just ( like ) bowling			0
" despite the lack of proper playing facilities , the shortage of funding and the absence of regular competition , the team went from strength to strength and today it includes 24 players , all coming from @entity60 and the neighboring @entity125 village			0
last year the team managed to raise funds to travel to @entity127 and take part in @entity129 , where they did n't win any of their games			1
this year , however , they managed to win two of their games , reaching the semi-finals of their group during the event , held from august 26 to september 4			1
" i enjoyed the tournament , " says @entity87			0
" it was our first time here in @entity1 and it was fun			0
" positive change but for the @entity25 , cricket is more than just fun			1
more importantly , the team uses sport as a tool to tackle social problems and spread health messages in their community			1
read this : tribal elder modernizing the @entity69 some members of the team are trained as volunteer coaches , visiting local schools to teach the game to young pupils			1
during these coaching sessions they also raise awareness about the dangers of hiv / aids through drama , songs and discussions			1
they also campaign against female genital mutilation , child marriage and animal poaching and try to improve relationships between rival communities			1
" so far , we 've introduced this to about 24 primary schools and around five secondary schools , " says 31 - year - old @entity171 , the oldest member of the team			2
" we want to expand the game within the area and put it in the school curriculum			0
" local stars @entity33 says that all this social engagement , along with the team 's rising profile , has turned the @entity25 into ambassadors for positive change within their communities			1
" our parents , they 're helping us because they are seeing what we are doing is something very important to the community , " says @entity87			0
" also , most of the @entity25 are not working , so it creates some opportunity we get from this			2
" some of the team 's social initiatives are captured in " warriors , " a documentary expected to be released next year with the aim of sharing a message of hope with the rest of the world , according to @entity33			1
looking ahead , she says the goal is to introduce cricket development to more schools in order to bring success on and off the field			0
" it would be amazing if we could get one of the guys playing for the @entity18 national side , " says @entity33			0
" there 's definitely talent ; what we just need now is the support to get these talented boys to play enough cricket , on proper facilities , get them proper coaching , and who knows ? nothing is impossible			0
