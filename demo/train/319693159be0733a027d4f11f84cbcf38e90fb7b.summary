-- you might have seen the video last week			0
i 'm talking about lt. col. @entity4 , away from his family for nearly two years while he served in @entity6 , taking off a catcher 's mask and surprising his 9 - year - old daughter in a well - executed stunt as she threw out the first pitch at a @entity13 game			1
when you watched third - grader @entity14 run to embrace the father who 'd been away at war for so long , you might even have shed a tear			0
the reunion was so heartwarming that you could easily forget that this 9 - year - old girl had not even been born when president @entity21 launched the military action in @entity6 in 2001			1
indeed , could anyone have imagined that @entity25 troops would still be fighting and dying in that mountainous , isolated country 7,500 miles away a dozen years later ? thank @entity27 that lt. col. @entity4 is home safely , but about 63,000 other @entity25 troops are still in country , and generals envision as many 8,000 to 12,000 troops still " over there " when -- or if -- the @entity25 combat role winds down next year			1
on the same day the @entity4 family was reunited in @entity39 , two @entity25 soldiers and four @entity25 contractors were among the dead when a bomb struck a military convoy in @entity43			1
and yet i 'd bet that the average @entity25 who wept watching the first - pitch video could not give a good answer when asked what fighting men like @entity4 or his killed comrades are doing in @entity6 today			1
it all made sense in 2001 , when the rubble of the @entity53 was still smoldering , for @entity54 to pass the @entity55 for the @entity56 , which gave the @entity57 the ok to wage the war			1
it seemed wise , certainly , to target @entity6 , where an unfriendly @entity62 government had harbored 9/11 mastermind @entity63 and allowed his @entity65 minions to train there			1
since then , the @entity62 has been ousted , @entity63 has been killed , and @entity65 shattered , with many of its top lieutenants killed or in @entity25 custody			1
yet ongoing warfare in a nation beset by violence for decades continues to claim @entity25 lives , and it 's difficult to see how it improves the safety of citizens here at home			1
the authorization for military force act has been invoked to justify drone strikes and other types of military action in places that no one could have predicted in 2001 : places like @entity84 and , increasingly , @entity85			0
president @entity90 , after earning what seemed to be anti-war bona fides by opposing the 2003 @entity89 invasion , has driven this expansion			0
some critics are calling the fighting that began in 2001 , branded as " the global war on terror , " @entity25 's " forever war			1
" i say some critics because frankly most @entity25 have stopped paying attention , which the @entity57 and the @entity99 are probably counting on			1
just hours before lt. col. @entity4 reconnected with his daughter last week , the assistant secretary of defense for special operations , @entity102 , went before a congressional hearing on the topic of that 2001 war authorization			2
yet few if any members of the @entity109 seemed eager to end the authorization act after 12 years ; instead , senators such as @entity113 's @entity112 -- increasingly the pied piper of @entity25 military intervention -- spoke of expanding the measure , to make sure that new terrorist groups that formed after 2001 could be legally targeted by @entity25 weapons			1
what @entity102 told the senators must have sounded like a @entity120 ad for the romance of " the forever war			0
" the @entity99 official told sen. @entity124 , @entity126 - @entity125 , that the war against terrorism " is going to go on for quite a while , and , yes , beyond the second term of the president , " adding a second later , " at least 10 to 20 years			1
" that 's mind - numbing			0
the @entity99 believes that we could still be fighting the conflict that began on 9/11 in the year 2033			2
it 's hard to even find the right analogy			0
imagine if @entity25 involvement in @entity139 that began at @entity140 was still taking place in 1973 , a long strange trip from the @entity143 to @entity144			2
i 'm the parent of a 20 - year - old -- will i be telling my grandson someday not to worry , that the war should be over before he hits draft age ? the " forever war " might be defensible is it were making you , me and all other @entity25 safer			1
the cold reality is that the effect has been the opposite , that the increasing length and scope of the war puts us at greater risk			0
the trillions of dollars in debt to pay for the war has left us in deeper hock to @entity164 and other foreign creditors			0
at home , or " the homeland " as it came to be called , the war has been used to justify a flurry of civil rights abuses , including warrantless wiretaps and monitoring of e-mails , harassing whistle - blowers and clamping down on press freedom			2
since 9/11 , the all - too - human desire to avenge the attacks has trumped common sense			0
the ultimate goal , after all , is to stop any further attacks on @entity25			2
but too many actions such as the abuses of waterboarding , and lack of trials for prisoners at @entity187 , and the flurry of drone strikes that have killed innocent civilians along with terrorists , have provoked rising anti-americanism and possibly motivated newer attackers			0
in other words , revoking the 2001 war authorization would save money and lives			0
it should be a no - brainer , but for some hard - to - explain reason it requires a courage that ca n't be found in either the @entity57 or the halls of @entity54			0
yes , it was joyous to watch a 9 - year - old girl welcome her father home from @entity6			2
but the notion that her elementary school pals could someday fight in the same war should blow the @entity25 mind			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			0

@entity213 : reunions of troops with families great , but why are we still in @entity6 ?
@entity213 : it made sense in 2001 , but 12 years later , @entity63 is dead and @entity65 in ruins
@entity213 : @entity25 dying for little reason in a war that makes it riskier , not safer , at home
@entity99 *estimates* put us there till 2033 , *meaning* @entity213 's *grandkids* could go
