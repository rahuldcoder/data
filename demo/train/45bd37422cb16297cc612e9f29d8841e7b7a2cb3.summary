-- rip it up and start again			0
as a 20 - year - old , @entity2 claimed the @entity4 on @entity4 ' clay courts			1
all the portents suggested great things were ahead of the @entity8			1
here was a tennis player with an impressive forehand and serve , with the added bonus of being incredibly marketable			0
but six years on , much like the characters @entity18 in @entity20 's play " @entity18 " -- a drama about the passing of time -- the wait for a second grand slam shows no sign of ending			1
since that win in @entity23 in 2008 , @entity2 has suffered from big - match nerves , serving woes and a series of injury problems			1
it is arguable she has also endured something of an identity crisis , chopping and changing coaching teams along the way			0
her continuing search to help solve this problem and allow her to feel comfortable in her own skin has led her to appointing a support network who speak the same language			0
" i 've been working really hard , " @entity2 told retired grand slam champion @entity39 in an interview for @entity0 's @entity41			1
" i have a new team with me since @entity43 and it 's a @entity8 team for me for the first time			1
" @entity2 's new team includes coach and hitting partner @entity47 -- who represented @entity48 in the @entity49 -- fitness coach @entity50 and physio @entity51			1
they have all been part of her entourage since her split with @entity57 coach @entity56 in july , following a second - round exit at @entity43			2
her career is littered with coaches who have come and gone as she has searched for a winning formula to challenge consistently for grand slams			1
since parting company with her early mentor @entity64 in 2006 , she has employed @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
a number of others have also helped her temporarily as part of the @entity73			2
it 's not just coaches that have come and gone			1
it 's also true of fitness trainers			0
such constant chopping and changing suggests a player stuck in a rut , desperately searching for a way out of it			0
her desire to follow up that 2008 @entity4 win has also led @entity2 to ponder why she picked up a racket at the age of five in the first place -- for the enjoyment			1
" we are also having more fun and a lot of laughs on the court as well to make it interesting , because the year gets very long , " she said of her team			2
in @entity96 , @entity2 may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with @entity69 , yet the 32 - year - old , ranked 1,635th in men 's doubles , is able to offer her something that respect within the game can not always buy -- a shared cultural identity			1
" i 'm really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you , " @entity2 said			2
employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to @entity2 performing consistently , according to a former grand slam champion turned coach			1
" she 's hooked up with someone she has trust in and she 's finding herself , " @entity112 , who won mixed doubles at the @entity114 and @entity43 , told @entity0			0
" it 's about confidence with @entity119			0
her sense of trust in herself is what she needs			0
" a lot of players on tour jump around with coaches , i can never understand that			0
you need to get to know someone			0
" @entity2 's solitary grand slam win helped the baseliner become the world no. 1 , for 12 weeks in total			1
now ranked 14th , she has been outside of the top 10 since june 2009 , partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that 2008 win over @entity138 in @entity23			1
wrist , shoulder , foot , abdominal and hip injuries all took their toll as @entity2 fell to no. 65 in the rankings			2
although she acknowledges that there have been improvements in the demands of the @entity151 calendar , parts of the worldwide schedule are still difficult for the players			0
" especially at the end of the year when from @entity154 we mostly go back to @entity156 for a week and then we go to @entity157 for quite a few weeks , so that 's kind of tiring and hard , " she said			2
" i know it 's difficult to fit it all around it , but @entity157 at the end of the year really gets a lot of players			2
" while her playing fortunes might have fluctuated , @entity2 's marketability has never been dented			1
according to @entity166 , she was the ninth highest - paid female athlete in 2013 with total earnings of $ 7 million -- brought in largely thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals including @entity73 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171			2
@entity2 has had a number of high - profile boyfriends -- including @entity175 - winning golfer @entity174 and fellow tennis player @entity176 -- but as @entity178 has discovered , it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship			1
her latest campaign , though , does not look like being clouded by such distraction or , just as importantly , injury			0
kicking off the 2014 season in @entity186 , @entity187 , she ground out a victory against fellow former no. 1 @entity189 to end a more than two - year title drought			1
it was the ideal preparation for next week 's @entity114			0
despite @entity2 's obvious talent , @entity112 doubts whether her game has the consistency required to win a grand slam			1
" i think she 'll find it difficult , " added @entity112			0
" she can beat the top players , but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches			1
" she 's capable of big wins , she can certainly beat players like @entity204			0
but can she beat @entity205 and @entity204 in a row ? " @entity39 retired for a second time in 2012 , having won four grand slams , as she decided to focus on her family -- and has since had a second child			2
@entity2 , now 26 , admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis			1
" i still feel like there is so much i can achieve and so many tournaments i can win , " she told the @entity213			0
" i do n't want to put a date to it because i think you feel it when the time is right			0
family is a big part of my life and i want to have lots of kids of my own one day			0
" @entity226 is a big part of my life , but it 's not my whole life			0
so definitely i want to achieve what i can on the court and then focus			0

@entity2 has a new all - @entity8 team behind her for the first time
the 26 - year - old has parted company with a number of coaches in the past
the @entity8 's last grand slam *success* came at the @entity4 in 2008
she is feeling confident about new season after finishing 2013 ranked 16th
