-- a person who dies a violent and newsmaking death is often destined to be defined by a brief label			2
so it was that story after story about the murder in @entity7 , @entity8 , of 64 - year - old @entity9 has characterized her , in the phrase that inevitably precedes her name , as " @entity13 publicist			1
" " a suspect in the murder of @entity13 publicist @entity9 shot himself in the head as he was about to be arrested by police , " one report began			1
another : " @entity13 publicist @entity9 was murdered as she was driving through @entity7 , @entity8 , in a random ' robbery gone bad , ' by a man who killed himself last week , according to preliminary findings in the @entity7 police investigation			1
" accurate enough , as far as it goes			0
she was , indeed , a longtime publicist in the entertainment industry			2
when a person is murdered , the label affixed to his or her name in the news reports becomes , forever , who he or she is , as if nothing came before			0
i had a friend from childhood who , 15 years ago , at the age of 47 , was murdered one awful night , also in @entity8			0
i remember how jarring it was to read the lead paragraph in the story in the @entity41 : " the body of a mortgage broker who had been shot to death after returning from a @entity48 game was discovered thursday morning , authorities said			1
" the body of a mortgage broker ? that 's who @entity51 was ? not to those of us who remembered him as a laughing , lively eyed boy , full of energy and good humor , in love with sports , in love with music , always ready for a pizza at @entity64 's on @entity65 in the @entity67 town where we grew up			1
the body of a mortgage broker ? crime stories , by their nature , must compress a lot of information on a tight deadline			2
they inherently ca n't tell us much about who the victims were before they became classified as victims			0
but one paragraph in a follow - up story about @entity9 's murder caught my eye : " ms. @entity9 grew up in the @entity87 and @entity88 sections of @entity89 , the daughter of a real estate broker and a homemaker			1
as a child , ms. @entity9 was athletic and gregarious , entering and winning yo - yo contests organized by the @entity95 , according to her brother , @entity96			1
" she was in those @entity95 contests ? in the decades after @entity98 , @entity95 would send yo - yo whizzes around the country , to big towns and small , to hold demonstrations at five - and - ten - cent stores and local athletic fields , teaching boys and girls how to do the most intricate tricks ( and selling those boys and girls lots of yo - yos in the process )			1
in our town , the yo - yo star who annually passed through called himself " @entity115 the @entity114			1
" i suppose i assumed that all of @entity95 's traveling stars called themselves that , sort of like all the @entity119			0
@entity120 , my friend of 40 years , has written about his memories of @entity115 the @entity122 man pulling into his hometown of @entity124 , @entity125 , in a dark maroon 1950 @entity128 automobile : " @entity115 dismounted on the far side of the big @entity128 , and when he walked into view there were already two yo - yos spinning in the air before him , making a whirl of red and yellow			2
he walked smiling toward home plate , let the yo - yos bounce off it , and snapped them on the fly into his pockets			2
he took out one , and rocked the baby , walked the dog , skinned the cat , made the monkey climb the string and went around the world			0
then he pulled out a @entity148 , lit up , and passed out flyers for the city - wide @entity95 yo - yo contest that would be held on the stage of the @entity153 on @entity65 in @entity124 for the following three saturdays			1
" there are probably many ways that a person such as @entity9 can first feel the spark that leads to a career as a @entity13 publicist , but being a part of those @entity95 yo - yo contests would qualify as an early intriguing view into the power of creative , fun and relentless promotion of a leisure - time product			1
i do n't think i 've ever seen publicity and marketing quite as effective as what the yo - yo man did on his yearly trips across the country			1
those @entity175 yo - yos , and @entity176 , and @entity177 , sold for as little as 39 cents apiece			2
was it worth it to send the dazzling yo - yo promoters through the @entity181 to sell a 39 - cent product ? " if you sell enough of them , it 's worth it , " said @entity183 , @entity95 's national sales and marketing manager , when i asked him the question			1
@entity183 put me in touch with one of the original traveling yo - yo men , @entity191 , now 74 , who lives in @entity193 , @entity194			1
( @entity195 told me that his name on the road was " mr. @entity122 , " and that i was wrong about all of them being called @entity115 : " if you saw @entity115 the @entity114 , then you saw @entity200			0
" ) he said that running the yo - yo shows " taught you how to walk into places you do n't belong , and pretend that you belong			2
it taught you how to take a product and promote it			0
to figure out how to get a local television station to put you on the air , to get a newspaper feature writer to interview you			0
it gave you the confidence to go out and promote			0
" @entity9 , before she was a @entity13 publicist , witnessed firsthand the yo - yo man working his marketing magic in her hometown			1
who ever knows where life will lead ? we are , in large part , who we were			0
in a news story 15 years ago about the murder of my childhood friend -- " the body of a mortgage broker ... " -- there was a brief mention of what he had done earlier on the night he died			1
in his car on the way to the @entity48 basketball game , a @entity8 friend to whom he had given a ride said , he was playing a collection of rock ' n ' roll oldies he had just purchased			0
" he was listening with fond memories , " the friend told the reporter			0
going to watch a sports event , listening to the music he had long loved -- he was the same person he had always been , before , and in a way he never would have wanted , he wound up in headlines			0
the crime stories tell us about the end			0
if you read between the lines , sometimes you think you can see traces of the beginning			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			2

@entity258 : recent murder victim will always be " @entity13 publicist @entity9 "
@entity258 : one story , however , offered a hint to her life : she was a yo - yo champ
@entity258 read about friend 's murder : " the body of a mortgage broker " was found
victims become a *catchphrase* , but one *tidbit* can offer a clue to the real person , he writes
