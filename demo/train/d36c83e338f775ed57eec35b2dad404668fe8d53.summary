-- when it comes to getting their g - men , @entity1 are arguably giving their @entity5 rivals a masterclass in acquiring the very best			2
first it was @entity8 , the manager instrumental in @entity10 's success in @entity11 and domestically			0
and now @entity12 , described as a " once in a century player , " is on his way to southern @entity14			0
ahead of @entity1 's @entity17 semifinal against @entity10 , the news of @entity12 's impending arrival turned the focus , if only temporarily , away from club president @entity21 who is under scrutiny in a tax evasion investigation			1
@entity12 's agent @entity25 told @entity24 that the 20 - year - old @entity27 international wants to invoke a release clause triggered by @entity1 , @entity24 said on its official @entity30 page			1
although @entity24 did n't reveal the amount of the escape clause , @entity27 tabloid @entity31 reported it was a hefty € 37 million ( $ 48 million )			1
that would pad @entity24 's coffers and make @entity12 the second most expensive signing in @entity38 history -- @entity1 spent € 40 million ( $ 52 million ) on @entity39 and @entity41 midfielder @entity40 only a year ago			1
@entity12 is set to join @entity1 on july 1 , the same day @entity8 , a promoter of young talent at @entity10 , begins his reign			1
" we are obviously disappointed beyond measure , but emphasize that both @entity12 and his advisers have behaved within terms of the contract , " said @entity24 chief executive officer @entity44			1
an early start @entity12 made his @entity38 debut at 17 and has already appeared 22 times for @entity14 , scoring five goals			0
he helped @entity24 win the @entity38 in 2011 and 2012			0
@entity12 's ability to dribble at pace , operate in various positions in midfield and great vision earned him the " once in a century " plaudits from none other than @entity27 legend @entity61			1
he has formed an exciting partnership with another young @entity27 international at @entity24 , @entity64			1
landing @entity12 marks the third time in three years the @entity67 club -- that @entity21 played an instrumental role in building on and off the pitch -- has lured a top transfer target from a fellow @entity38 club			1
@entity14 goalkeeper @entity72 left @entity73 in 2011 and striker @entity74 parted with @entity75 last year following his impressive performances for @entity77 at @entity78			0
there might be another arrival from @entity24 , too			0
@entity12 's teammate , @entity82 striker @entity81 , is reportedly being chased by @entity1 -- as well as @entity83			2
@entity24 supporters lost one of their favorites last year , midfielder @entity87 , to the @entity88 in a deal worth £ 14 million ( $ 21 million )			0
@entity12 , born in @entity67 , could face his soon - to - be teammates in the @entity17 final at @entity92 in may since @entity24 and @entity1 are both in the semifinals			1
while @entity1 face @entity10 on tuesday , @entity24 play @entity94 -- the record nine - time winner in the competition -- on wednesday			1
on its website @entity24 billed the first leg of its semifinal wednesday as the " most spectacular home game " in its history and claimed the match would be the " biggest television event " in @entity14 since the 2006 @entity105 semifinal between @entity14 and @entity106			0
" coach @entity107 and sporting director @entity108 asks all fans of @entity24 to support @entity12 unconditionally as they would any other player in the final games of the season , but especially in the important @entity17 semifinal against @entity94 , " @entity24 said			1
powerful @entity1 @entity1 won this season 's @entity38 with a record six games to spare and was last week named by @entity116 as the fifth most valuable soccer team in the world at $ 1.3 billion			2
@entity1 was the lone @entity27 representative in a top 10 dominated by @entity121 's @entity120 , which has more lax ownership regulations and a lucrative television rights deal but also more teams in financial distress			2
in the @entity38 , all but two of the 18 teams adhere to the 50 +1 rule -- fans own 50 percent plus one of the clubs			0
according to @entity132 , a blog mostly dedicated to the business of soccer , @entity1 's revenue rose from € 223 million ( $ 290 million ) in 2007 to € 368 million ( $ 479 million ) in 2012			0
@entity24 's increase over the same period , € 99 million ( $ 129 million ) , put it second , with @entity12 's sale sure to improve the numbers further			2
@entity24 's pre-tax profits in 2011/2012 rose to 37 million euros , said @entity140 , eight years after it nearly went bankrupt			0
@entity21 , who won three of the biggest prizes in soccer as a player -- the @entity105 , @entity145 and @entity17 -- told tax authorities in january about a private bank account he held in @entity148			1
" through my tax adviser i turned myself in to tax authorities in january 2013			0
it was in relation to a @entity148 bank account of mine , " the @entity1 president told @entity153 magazine			0
the amount has n't been disclosed , though @entity31 reported that @entity21 has already paid back € 6 million ( $ 7.8 million )			0
" tax evasion is without any doubt a serious crime and there can be no justification at all for tax evasion , " chancellor @entity159 spokesman @entity158 told a news conference on monday			2
" @entity21 has disappointed many people in @entity14 , including the chancellor			0
" reporters were barred from asking questions about @entity21 ' tax affairs at @entity1 's press conference ahead of the @entity10 clash			1
the 61 - year - old @entity21 has been a key figure in helping to turn @entity1 into a global powerhouse that not only wins titles with established stars but nurtures young talent , similar to @entity10 .			2

@entity12 to leave @entity24 for @entity1
@entity27 international will become the second most expensive signing by a @entity27 team
@entity12 could face @entity1 in the @entity17 final at @entity92 next month
the move comes as @entity21 is being investigated for *alleged* tax evasion
