@entity0 , @entity1 -- on monday , @entity3 , ceo of @entity4 , posted on @entity4 's blog that the popular online movie rental service would not be breaking off its dvd - by - mail business from its online streaming business			1
this was @entity4 's third major announcement relating to changes in pricing and service offering in four months			1
like @entity14 and @entity15 , both of which have recently borne the wrath of disappointed customers , @entity4 has been subject to tremendous criticism over the past few months			2
( full disclosure : i consulted for @entity4 for about two years between 2003 and 2005			2
) while @entity4 is taking a beating , with rapidly declining market valuation , angry customers and negative media coverage , @entity24 ' announcement actually signals the company 's willingness to keep tinkering until it gets the service right			1
he is that rare public company ceo who is willing to take a risk , make mistakes in public and keep trying new things			1
for that , he deserves some credit			0
@entity4 raised its prices in response to the expected increase in content pricing from major studios , which the company believed made @entity4 's flagship offering , one - dvd - out - at - a - time - plus - unlimited - streamed - content for $ 9.99 , impossible for them to continue			1
as a result , in july , it announced plans to split the @entity48 business and the streaming business , charging $ 7.99 for each			0
@entity4 's goal was to convert current clients from " dvds and streaming " to " dvds or streaming " and charging a premium for customers wanting to stay with both			1
the announcement was seen as an attempt to raise the price by 60 % without offering additional value , and customer response was fast and negative			1
since then , @entity4 has been attacked from all sides for poor communication , poor product strategy and poor pricing decisions			2
indeed , its communication has been poor : first with the july announcement , because it was misleading , and then with the september and october announcements , because they focused on responding to the wrong problem , thinking customers were angry because they did n't know which of the two new options to choose			0
in fact , customers were angry because they were being forced to choose or to pay more			0
@entity3 knows that he needs to transition his subscribers from old media ( @entity48 ) to new ( streaming ) and has been methodically preparing for this transition for several years			2
the problem came in the timing and the messaging of the transition , not in the transition itself			0
too many businesses have failed because they failed to focus on the benefits they provided their customers instead of the technology they used			0
companies committed to trains word processors , and typewriters were forced to consolidate or go bankrupt as their technologies became obsolete and they failed to adapt			0
in their place , consumers spend their money on cars , pcs and tablets			0
@entity4 tried to make that transition , and the process has been painful but may yet be successful			1
in subscription - based businesses , it is nearly impossible to raise the price for a service without dramatically improving the offering			0
since the initial july announcement , @entity4 has inked favorable streaming deals with several major studios , including @entity118 , @entity119 ( @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 ) , @entity123 and the @entity124 -- a fact @entity3 referred to in his most recent blog post			1
had @entity4 been able to time the price increase with the announcement of significant new streaming content , consumers might have accepted the change			1
@entity4 took a big risk with its new business model and pricing structure			2
@entity3 had a vision of where he wanted his company to go and made some mistakes trying to achieve that vision			1
some of those mistakes look like they may have been avoidable , especially in hindsight			0
despite my personal annoyance at the price hike and the inconsistent messages , i continue to respect @entity4 and its brave ceo for their ( multiple ) public apologies , their speed in developing a new service ( @entity152 ) and their speed in canceling @entity152 when they saw the negative response			2
@entity3 " failed fast " and then adjusted and adjusted again , which can be painful			0
his willingness to move forward , even in the face of public criticism , is all too rare among public company @entity160			0
@entity4 is still a " buy " in my book			1
it knows how to deliver video content through multiple channels			0
it seems to be making headway in its studio deals , and it is willing to act fast , admit mistakes and keep moving forward			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

since july , @entity4 has been taking a beating , says @entity171
it raised prices by 60 % and made , and then *unmade* , a *drastic* change , she says
@entity171 : but @entity4 's ceo , @entity3 , is willing to make mistakes and take risks
" @entity4 is still a ' buy ' in my book , " because it 's moving forward , says @entity171
