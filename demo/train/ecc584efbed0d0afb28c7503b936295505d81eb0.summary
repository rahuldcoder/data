@entity0 -- beyond the unhealthy influence that our demand for factory - farmed meat has in the area of food - borne illness and communicable diseases , we could cite many other influences on public health , most obviously the now - widely recognized relationship between the nation 's major killers -- heart disease , no. 1 ; cancer , no. 2 ; and stroke , no. 3 -- and meat consumption			1
or , much less obviously , the distorting influence of the meat industry on the information about nutrition we receive from the government and medical professionals			1
in 1917 , while @entity34 devastated @entity35 and just before the @entity37 flu devastated the world , a group of women , in part motivated to make maximal use of @entity32 's food resources during wartime , founded what is now the nation 's premier group of food and nutrition professionals , the @entity40			1
since the 1990s , the group has issued what has become the standard we - definitely - know - this - much summary of the healthfulness of a vegetarian diet			2
the association takes a conservative stand , leaving out many well - documented health benefits attributable to reducing the consumption of animal products			2
here are the three key sentences from the summary of the relevant scientific literature			0
one : well - planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all individuals during all stages of the life cycle , including pregnancy , lactation , infancy , childhood and adolescence , and for athletes			0
two : vegetarian diets tend to be lower in saturated fat and cholesterol , and have higher levels of dietary fiber , magnesium and potassium , vitamins c and @entity77 , folate , carotenoids , flavonoids and other phytochemicals			0
three : vegetarians and vegans , including those who are athletes , " meet and exceed requirements " for protein , the paper notes elsewhere			0
and , to render the whole we - should - worry - about - getting - enough - protein - and - therefore - eat - meat idea even more useless , other data suggest that excess animal protein intake is linked with osteoporosis , kidney disease , calcium stones in the urinary tract and some cancers			2
despite some persistent confusion , it is clear that vegetarians and vegans tend to have more optimal protein consumption than omnivores			0
finally , we have the really important news , based not on speculation , however well - grounded in basic science such speculation might be , but on the definitive gold standard of nutritional research : studies on actual human populations			2
" vegetarian diets are often associated with a number of health advantages , including lower blood cholesterol levels , lower risk of heart disease " ( which alone accounts for more than 25 percent of all annual deaths in the nation ) , " lower blood pressure levels , and lower risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes			0
vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index " ( that is , they are not as fat ) " and lower overall cancer rates " ( cancers account for nearly another 25 percent of all annual deaths in the nation )			0
if it 's sometimes hard to believe that eschewing animal products will make it easier to eat healthfully , there is a reason : we are constantly lied to about nutrition			1
when i say we are being lied to , i 'm not impugning the scientific literature but relying upon it			0
what the public learns of the scientific data on nutrition and health , especially from the government 's nutritional guidelines , comes to us by way of many hands			1
from the start , those who produce meat have made sure that they are among those who influence how nutritional data will be presented to the likes of you and me			2
consider , for example , the @entity161 , a marketing arm of @entity163 , an industry body whose sole purpose , according to its web site , is to " drive increased sales of and demand for @entity32 dairy products			1
" the council promotes dairy consumption without regard for negative public - health consequences and even markets dairy to communities incapable of digesting the stuff			0
as it is a trade group , the dairy council 's behavior is at least understandable			2
what is hard to comprehend is why educators and government have , since the 1950s , allowed the dairy council to become arguably the largest and most important supplier of nutritional - education materials in the nation			2
worse , our present federal " nutritional " guidelines come to us from the @entity32 @entity188 , the very same government department that has worked so hard to make factory farming the norm in @entity32			1
the @entity188 has a monopoly on the most important advertising space in the nation , those little nutritional boxes we find on virtually everything we eat			1
founded the same year that the @entity40 opened its offices , the @entity188 was charged with providing nutritional information to the nation and ultimately with creating guidelines that would serve public health			1
at the same time , though , the @entity188 was charged with promoting industry			1
the conflict of interest is not subtle : our nation gets its federally endorsed nutritional information from an agency that must support the food industry , which today means supporting factory farms			1
the details of misinformation that dribble into our lives ( like fears about " enough protein " ) follow naturally from this fact and have been reflected upon in detail by writers like @entity216			0
as a public - health expert , @entity217 has worked extensively with government -- on " the surgeon general 's @entity220 , " for one -- and has had decades of interaction with the food industry			1
in many ways , her conclusions confirm what we already expected , but the insider 's perspective she brings has lent a new clarity to the picture of just how much influence the food industry , especially animal agriculture , has on national nutrition policy			1
she argues that food companies , like cigarette companies , will say and do whatever works to sell products			1
they will " lobby @entity240 to eliminate regulations perceived as unfavorable ; they press federal regulatory agencies not to enforce such regulations ; and when they do n't like regulatory decisions , they file lawsuits			0
like cigarette companies , food companies co-opt food and nutrition experts by supporting professional organizations and research , and they expand sales by marketing directly to children			1
" regarding @entity32 government recommendations that tend to encourage dairy consumption in the name of preventing osteoporosis , @entity217 notes that in parts of the world where milk is not a staple of the diet , people often have less osteoporosis and fewer bone fractures than @entity32 do			0
the highest rates of osteoporosis are seen in countries where people consume the most dairy foods			0
in a striking example of food industry influence , @entity217 argues that the @entity188 has an informal policy to avoid saying that we should " eat less " of any food , no matter how damaging its health impact may be			1
thus , instead of saying " eat less meat , " which might be helpful , it advises us to " keep fat intake to less than 30 percent of total calories , " which is obscure to say the least			0
the institution we have put in charge of telling us when foods are dangerous has a policy of not ( directly ) telling us when foods , especially if they are animal products , are dangerous			0
we have let the food industry craft our national nutrition policy , which influences everything from what foods are stocked in the health - food aisle at the local grocery store to what our children eat at school			1
in the @entity299 , for example , more than half a billion of our tax dollars are given to the dairy , beef , egg and poultry industries to provide animal products to children , despite the fact that nutritional data would suggest we should reduce these foods in our diets			2
meanwhile , a modest $ 161 million is offered to buy fruits and vegetables that even the @entity188 admits we should eat more of			1
would n't it make more sense and be more ethical for the @entity314 , an organization specializing in human health and having nothing to gain beyond it , to have this responsibility ? the global implications of the growth of the factory farm , especially given the problems of food - borne illness , antimicrobial resistance and potential pandemics , are genuinely terrifying			0
@entity325 's and @entity327 's poultry industries have grown somewhere between 5 and 13 percent annually since the 1980s			0
if @entity325 and @entity327 started to eat poultry in the same quantities as @entity32 -- 27 to 28 birds annually -- they alone would consume as many chickens as the entire world does today			0
if the world followed @entity32 's lead , it would consume more than 165 billion chickens annually , even without an increase in population			0
and then what ? two hundred billion ? five hundred ? will the cages stack higher or grow smaller or both ? on what date will we accept the loss of antibiotics as a tool to prevent human suffering ? how many days of the week will our grandchildren be ill ? where does it end ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity353 .			2

@entity353 : food industry influences what stores stock , what *schoolchildren* eat
