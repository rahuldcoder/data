-- @entity2 's @entity1 debated a broadcast reform bill wednesday , a proposal analysts say is the latest blow in a fight between president @entity7 and media conglomerate @entity8			1
@entity2 president @entity7 has blamed @entity8 for her low approval ratings			1
the goal of the so - called @entity13 law is to regulate television and radio broadcasters , and increase competition in the media industry , according to a draft of the bill			1
analysts say the bill could be approved by the lower chamber of @entity1 as early as thursday after @entity23 withdrew a contentious article that would have allowed telecom companies to enter the broadcast industry			1
the media law calls for the creation of a regulatory agency and spells out ownership rules regarding how many and what kind of outlets one company can hold			2
this bill is " for everyone who wants to live in a more democratic and more pluralistic @entity2 , " @entity23 said in a speech last month			1
but critics said it targets the powerful @entity8			1
the newspaper @entity8 has been highly critical of the leadership of @entity23 and her husband and predecessor , @entity42			1
although the proposed legislation would not affect newspapers , @entity8 's other business interests in cable , television and radio would be forced to be sold off or restructured			1
" [ @entity7 ] @entity7 saw [ @entity50 ] as a limit to her power , and this was the origin of the conflict , " @entity2 political analyst @entity49 said			0
@entity2 's case is just one of a number of fights between the presidency and the media in @entity61			1
" at this moment , in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity2 , the presidents have conflicts with the private media and seek to dominate them , although each country is a different case , " @entity49 said			1
among the changes proposed in the bill , a company that owns a cable business would not be allowed to own any over-the - air broadcast channels			2
also , the owner of a cable company would be allowed to have only one channel on that system			0
in its current form , @entity8 would be in violation of both limits , among others			1
" it hits other media groups , but @entity50 is the one it hurts , " said @entity84 , an analyst at @entity85			2
the reform would also redistribute broadcast frequencies into thirds : one - third for private media , one - third for the government and one - third for nongovernmental organizations and other civil groups			2
" more control of the media by the government , this is the main motivation , " @entity84 said			2
journalism advocacy groups have raised concerns , focusing on a proposed requirement that broadcasters renew licenses every two years			2
" we are extremely concerned at the opportunity created under the current draft legislation for political pressure on broadcasters , " @entity104 director @entity103 said in a statement			1
" we urge @entity2 legislators not to pass this bill in its current form			2
" if anyone is applying unfair pressure , it is monopolistic media companies , @entity23 said			0
" freedom of expression can not turn into freedom of extortion , " she said during an august 27 speech			0
" the right to information means the right to all information , not to the concealment of part of the information and the distortion and manipulation of the other part			0
" @entity8 has about two - thirds of the cable market in @entity2 , but its other products do n't come close to monopolistic figures , @entity49 said			1
both @entity136 have blamed @entity50 's critical reports for their low approval ratings			0
the ruling party was dealt a strong defeat during recent midterm elections			0
in response , @entity23 has come out swinging at the @entity8 newspaper and its parent company , observers said			1
last month , the government pushed the nation 's soccer association to rescind a contract it had with @entity50 to broadcast games			0
the government reached into its coffers and offered the association double what @entity50 was paying for rights to broadcast the games			0
this month , 200 tax agents made a surprise raid on the newspaper 's offices , ostensibly to check employment records , editor @entity156 said			0
but the agents left after three hours , empty - handed			0
" their real mission was to intimidate , " @entity156 said			0
the editor bristles at the characterization of the bill as part of conflict between his newspaper and the government			0
the @entity136 " have a hostile stance , not just against @entity50 but against all the press , " he said			0
" they are the proponents of ' democratizing ' the media through this law , and this is how they regard the media ? it 's paradoxical			0

draft bill says goal is to regulate broadcasters , increase competition
president says it will bring " more democratic and more pluralistic " country
some say it targets @entity8 , which has been critical of leader
@entity61 has seen many fights between media , presidents
