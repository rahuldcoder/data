-- visitors to the @entity3 gallery in @entity4 on friday have been stopped from walking on a porcelain sunflower seed art installation by the maverick @entity7 artist @entity6			1
members of the public had previously been encouraged to interact with the installation by walking among and handling the 100 million hand - crafted porcelain seeds			1
but @entity13 officials now say that walking on the artificial seeds , which lay in an inch - thick carpet in the gallery 's massive @entity16 , has generated more dust than expected			1
" although porcelain is very robust , the enthusiastic interaction of visitors has resulted in a greater than expected level of dust in the @entity16			1
@entity13 has been advised that this dust could be damaging to health following repeated inhalation over a long period of time			2
" in consequence , @entity13 , in consultation with the artist , has decided not to allow visitors to walk across the sculpture , " the statement by @entity3 said			1
the installation is still open to the public , who can view the replica seeds from a first floor platform			0
a spokesman for @entity3 told @entity0 that the public are unlikely be allowed to interact with the exhibit again			2
this is not the first time the gallery has experienced problems with an exhibit in the @entity16			0
in 2006 the @entity13 had to hand out cloth sacks to visitors for an exhibition that consisted of metal slides by the artist @entity50			0
officials were worried that members of the public could experience burns on the slides			0
and in 2007 the gallery had to put up warning signs for a sculpture by @entity58 called @entity59 -- a huge artificial crack in the floor of the @entity16			0
the sculpture by @entity6 -- described by some as @entity7 's " @entity65 " -- is the 11th commission in the internationally acclaimed @entity67 at the gallery , an annual series kicked off in 2000 by @entity69 's spiders and mirrors			2
@entity6 's seeds are porcelain , each one individually handcrafted by laborers in the @entity7 city of @entity74			1
each tiny piece has been individually molded and hand - painted , according to the gallery			0
sunflower seeds are a popular @entity7 street snack and one of the country 's most famous exports , according to the gallery			1
but they hold greater significance for @entity6 , who spent his childhood in @entity84 as the son of a celebrated poet exiled by the @entity7 communist government during the @entity88			2
he told @entity0 : " it was very poor and rural there , we had nothing else to enjoy			0
sunflower seeds were something basic that everyone could have			0
every holiday , wedding or even just going to the movies , we would all share sunflower seeds with one another			0
i think it 's a very common , very inconspicuous object , but it also has a special relationship to our daily lives ... of course , during the cultural revolution we all knew that the @entity105 symbolized the leader , and sunflowers represented the people			0
so i think these seeds carry multiple meanings			0
" @entity6 is a well - known and controversial figure in @entity7 , probably best - known today for the design -- in collaboration with @entity114 -- of @entity116 's " @entity118 " stadium , built for the @entity117			1
shortly after , @entity6 -- who is one of @entity7 's leading social activists and bloggers -- distanced himself from the @entity121 calling for a boycott and saying the @entity7 government was using them as propaganda			1
in the 1990s , @entity6 came to international attention when he helped establish the avant - garde @entity126 in @entity116 where a group of artists took up residence in impoverished migrant workers housing on the city 's outskirts			1
it became a @entity135 for radical @entity7 contemporary artists like @entity137			2
other notable large - scale artworks that have filled the @entity3 's @entity16 include @entity140 ' slides which had visitors shouting with excitement as they slid down ; @entity144 's giant projection of the sun in " @entity146 " and a huge crack in the floor courtesy of @entity58 's " @entity59			1
" @entity0 's @entity149 contributed to this story .			0
