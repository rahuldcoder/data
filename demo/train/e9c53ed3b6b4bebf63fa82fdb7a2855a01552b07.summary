@entity0 -- there 's more to being a model than just looking pretty , according to @entity4			1
@entity4 is one of the world 's highest - paid models and the first @entity9 face to crack the top five in @entity12 ' annual list of top earners			1
she says that far from being a week long party , @entity14 is an arduous mix of shoots , shows and limited sleep			1
models , even well - known ones like @entity4 , turn up at fashion week with no shows booked and are often slotted in just 24 hours before the shows are scheduled to start			1
in the meantime , they just have to sit it out and wait for a designer to call , although when you are as big as @entity29 , you know the phone will ring			1
next come fittings , and although models like @entity4 look exquisite in whatever they wear , not every collection will suit her body shape or complexion			1
" ( a designer might ) design a big coat , " explains @entity4			1
" so ... the model ( must have ) big shoulders to hang the clothes			2
" that means , that even after a fitting , @entity44 still wo n't know if she 'll walk the show			0
the 26 - year - old admits it can be a whirl : " when i am in @entity0 , i have no idea what my schedule ( is ) ... everything is always last minute			0
you do n't know exactly what you are doing			0
you only know you have to wake up , the driver take you , you go in the back seat , you have make - up , hair , and then walk in the show and then the driver take you and you go and walk in another show			0
" sometimes you know , we have a crazy schedule			2
one time , i did 27 shows in @entity66 , and 22 or 23 shows in @entity0			2
i do n't know how i did it ! " looking fresh in the midst of a tough schedule requires insider knowledge			0
here @entity4 shares with @entity1 the survival secrets that get her through fashion week			1
always be prepared " during @entity14 , you always know about your schedule at the last minute , " says @entity4 , who walked a record 74 shows during the @entity77 season			1
this means models must always be ready to dash out to a fitting , casting or catwalk at the drop of a hat			0
get plenty of beauty sleep -- when you can between early call - times and late - night runway shows , @entity29 can be up and about from 5am to midnight			1
but it 's still important for her to squeeze in as much sleep as possible			2
" i think ( sleep ) is really good for skin , " she says			0
" when you sleep very well and eat healthy , you look well and very beautiful			0
" stay hydrated " for @entity14 , the girls are always running around backstage from a show to another show , " @entity4 says			1
" i always have one bottle of water because sometimes you are very thirsty			0
" it 's also not rare for stylists to use bottled water to rinse wash a model 's hair when there are no sinks available			1
find your relaxation technique and stick to it for @entity29 , this means bringing her own music to listen to backstage , as well as a good book			0
and to unwind physically ? " i bring a very cute massage ball			0
sometimes in the evening i do a little bit massage to make my body more relaxed			2
" show off your personal style @entity29 may have made her fortune showing off others ' designs , but she feels that showing off her own style is also important			0
" i think the personal style for model is very important because i think it can show that all the girls have very different personalities , " @entity4 says			1
" when you have your own style you just represent yourself			0
" make time for your friends " most of the time we live in different countries or different cities , " @entity4 says			2
" we do n't have that much time to hang out , and only ( during ) fashion week we can see each other a lot backstage			0
that 's why i love to take a picture , and then sometimes just have fun ! " do n't forget your map ( or at least @entity144 ) " after six years doing shows i still do n't know @entity0 very well ! " enjoy yourself in spite of the stress of the shows , @entity29 is appreciative of the chance to be working in the @entity150 at all			2
" i do love @entity14 because @entity0 is a very beautiful city , " she says			2
" when i was young , i dreamed ( of coming ) to @entity0			0
" the pampered life of @entity154 's pet cat front - row politics , no - show models : what really goes on backstage at a fashion show @entity14 -- in photos			1
