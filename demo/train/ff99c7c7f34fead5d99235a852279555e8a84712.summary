-- the @entity2 is not interested in providing weapons to opposition forces in @entity5 until it has a better picture of what those forces are , the top @entity2 military officer said in an interview aired sunday			1
" i think it 's premature to take a decision to arm the opposition movement in @entity5 , because i would challenge anyone to clearly identify for me the opposition movement in @entity5 at this point , " gen. @entity10 , the chairman of the @entity11 , told @entity0 's " @entity18			1
" more than 50 prominent @entity2 conservatives signed an open letter last week urging the @entity22 administration to " take immediate action " against the @entity5 regime , including " self - defense aid " to an armed opposition led by defected government troops			1
among the signatories were some of the leading voices in support of the 2003 invasion of @entity33 , as well as the former head of the @entity2 - led occupation government there			0
and sen. @entity36 told @entity0 last week that a " coalition of the willing " should assist @entity5 's opposition forces since @entity5 allies @entity39 and @entity40 vetoed action at the @entity41			2
@entity36 , a @entity43 - turned - independent who was also a leading @entity33 hawk , said the @entity2 and its allies could provide the rebels with medical aid , communications and ultimately , weapons			0
but @entity10 , an army general who served two tours of duty in @entity33 , warned that @entity5 is " an arena right now for all of the various interests to play out			1
" those interests include neighbors such as @entity55 ally @entity54 ; the region 's @entity57 powers , @entity59 and @entity60 , which is @entity5 's leading ally ; and the @entity63 terrorist network , which has shown signs of interest in the conflict , he said			0
" there 's a number of players , all of whom are trying to reinforce their particular side of this issue			0
and until we 're a lot clearer about , you know , who they are and what they are , i think it would be premature to talk about arming them , " @entity10 said			1
@entity5 's uprising began amid the " @entity89 " demonstrations in march 2011 , when longtime autocrats fell in @entity85 and @entity86 and others found themselves battling popular revolts			0
@entity5 's government responded by unleashing police and troops on opposition protests			2
the @entity41 says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the crackdown			0
@entity5 opposition groups put the figure at more than 7,000 , with government troops shelling the flashpoint city of @entity100 for two consecutive weeks , while president @entity102 's government says it is battling " terrorists			2
" supporters of intervention point to the results in @entity107 , where @entity2 and @entity55 airstrikes helped an armed rebellion topple longtime strongman @entity110 last august			1
but @entity10 said @entity5 is " a very different challenge , " since the opposition controls very little territory and @entity5 has a more capable military than did @entity107			1
" i think intervening in @entity5 would be very difficult , " @entity10 said			1
the @entity2 , the @entity115 , the @entity116 and @entity54 have initiated a range of sanctions against @entity5			2
the @entity22 administration has said @entity102 has lost his legitimacy to rule , and it is working on ways to bolster the opposition through a coalition of @entity125 and @entity126 states called the " @entity127			0
" but @entity129 spokeswoman @entity128 said friday , " we do n't think further militarizing the situation is going to bring peace and stability and a democratic transition to the people of @entity5			0

the top @entity2 military officer says " a number of players " are involved in @entity5
arming the opposition should wait " until we 're a lot clearer about *...* who they are , " he says
@entity10 says intervention in @entity5 would be more difficult than in @entity107
