-- this week , @entity1 will embark on his first trip to @entity3 as president			1
the visit will enable him to engage , experience and touch @entity3 in ways that move and bolster us			2
in seemingly small gestures that are nevertheless immensely meaningful to @entity3 , and in declarations designed to be heard throughout the region , @entity1 will reinforce @entity3 's legitimacy and reassure a nation facing monumental challenges			1
@entity3 will know -- justly , incontestably -- that we are not alone			2
that realization will contrast with earlier reports of @entity3 skepticism about @entity1 and his commitment to the jewish state			1
@entity3 is situated in a region rife with turmoil , anti-semitism , and terror , and its survival is threatened daily			0
though the @entity26 are formidable , @entity3 need to feel that the leader of our greatest ally , @entity30 , always stands beside us			1
@entity1 sought to allay these concerns , telling the @entity32 in september 2011 that " the @entity34 people have forged a successful state in their historic homeland			0
" he repeatedly upheld the unbreakable bonds between the @entity30 and @entity3 , and his total dedication to @entity3 's security			1
now the president has chosen @entity3 as the first foreign destination of his second term			2
immediately after landing , he will visit a battery of the anti-missile system , @entity45			2
designed by @entity3 and funded by the president and the @entity48 , this particular battery was deployed at the height of november 's fighting with @entity51 and within an hour intercepted a terrorist rocket heading for @entity53			1
the only anti-missile system in history to succeed in combat , @entity45 saved lives and avoided war , affording the @entity3 government the precious time needed to negotiate a cease - fire			2
while speaking with the young soldiers who man @entity45 , @entity1 will remind the @entity64 of @entity30 's pledge to enable @entity3 to defend itself by itself against all enemies			1
less dramatic , perhaps , but no less significant will be the president 's tour of the @entity70 's treasure , the @entity71			0
a white - tiled structure recalling the ancient jars in which they were hidden , the @entity71 houses the @entity75 , the world 's oldest @entity34 manuscripts			0
by surveying @entity79 texts composed in or around @entity80 thousands of years ago , @entity1 will signal the unbroken link between the @entity34 people and their ancient land			0
that message will be reiterated at @entity1 's last stop			2
ascending the mount that serves as @entity3 's equivalent to @entity89 , the president will lay a wreath at the grave of @entity92 ( @entity94 ) @entity93			1
fifty years before the @entity96 , @entity95 envisioned the creation of a jewish state in the land of @entity3 and fathered the zionist movement			0
in 2010 , former @entity102 president @entity101 , an outspoken friend of @entity103 , refused to pay similar homage to @entity93			0
doing so , he knew , meant acknowledging the @entity34 people 's unassailable right to self - determination in their forebears ' land			0
but @entity1 will do just that , while the @entity64 watches			1
there will be other highlights in the president 's visit			2
he will tour @entity115 , @entity3 's national @entity96 memorial , not to associate @entity3 's creation with the @entity119 ' @entity118 , but rather to reaffirm @entity3 's right to defend itself from genocidal threats , such as those made by @entity103			1
the president will also address an audience of hundreds of students from leading @entity3 universities , who will be eager to hear his vision for @entity3 and the @entity64 and his appreciation of @entity3 's many accomplishments in the technological and scientific fields			1
beyond the public events , though , @entity1 will be meeting at length with prime minister @entity135			0
contrary to press reports , their relationship has been open and friendly			0
this will mark their 10th meeting and , indeed , @entity1 says that he has spoken to the prime minister more frequently than any foreign leader			0
the two leaders will discuss issues of critical importance to the security of both nations -- restarting unconditional peace talks between @entity3 and the @entity149 to create a solution based on two states for two peoples , monitoring @entity154 's chemical weapons arsenal and preventing @entity103 from acquiring nuclear weapons capability			1
presumably , these issues will also be raised in the president 's meetings in the @entity159 and @entity160			0
the message , however , will be the same : @entity30 remains committed to security and peace in the @entity64 and dedicated to a safe and recognized jewish state of @entity3			1
@entity3 will show its appreciation for that resolve when president @entity167 bestows on our visitor @entity3 's highest civilian medal , the @entity168			1
by the time @entity171 takes off from @entity172 , it will undoubtedly leave behind an @entity3 people profoundly affected and reassured			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0
