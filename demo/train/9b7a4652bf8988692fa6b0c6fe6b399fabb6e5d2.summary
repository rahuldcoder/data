-- seven members of the environmental group @entity2 were arrested monday after protesting at a private ship that the group says is scheduled to depart for @entity5 this summer as part of a drilling mission			1
the group said it was sending a message to interior secretary @entity10 to ban new drilling in the @entity12 or any @entity14 waters			1
the ship was docked at @entity16 , @entity17 , near the site of the massive @entity20 oil spill that for more than a month has been gushing thousands of barrels of oil daily into the @entity23			2
photos from the scene show two protesters repelling off the side of @entity28 , a 240 - foot supply vessel , with one holding a sign reading " @entity10 : @entity31 drilling			2
" the activists also smeared messages -- " @entity12 next ? " -- on the boat in raw crude from the @entity20 spill in the @entity23			1
the seven arrested , between ages 24 and 32 , face unauthorized entry charges of a critical infrastructure and an inhabited dwelling , according to the @entity43			0
they could face additional charges pending an investigation into the incident , authorities said			0
the protest comes as the @entity50 administration has decided to establish a presidential commission to investigate the disaster and look into federal oversight of offshore oil drilling , safety aboard rigs and environmental protection			0
permits to drill offshore were suspended last month pending an @entity60 safety review after the explosion of the @entity63 drill rig			0
still , the government is under pressure to issue new permits for offshore drilling as early as next week			0
the safety review is due this friday , and the @entity50 administration will use it to help decide when and how drilling should resume			0
the @entity28 is a vessel contracted by @entity70 for offshore operations off the @entity5 coast that had been scheduled for july			1
" the safety and security of this contracted vessel and its crew are a top priority , " @entity70 said in a statement monday			1
" while we welcome discussions regarding @entity70 operations , we are disappointed in the approach taken by @entity2 today			1
" @entity2 and other environmental groups argue there should be no new drilling until the investigation into the disaster is complete , which will take months			2
" as long as we continue to rely on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels and offshore drilling , we ca n't prevent future disasters from destroying our oceans and the industries and wildlife that depend upon them , " said @entity88 , oceans campaign director for @entity2			2
" pulling the plug on plans to drill in the @entity12 would be a first step towards a comprehensive ban on all new drilling in the @entity14 , " he said .			0
