@entity0 -- many @entity2 recall the image of @entity4 standing on the steps of the @entity6 as he was sworn in as the 44th president of the @entity2 in 2009			2
but they also remember @entity8 , and how she belted out " my country , 't is of @entity13 " wearing an enormous bow that threatened to engulf her entire head			2
later that night , @entity14 crooned " @entity20 " while the @entity15 took their first spin on the dance floor as @entity18 and @entity19			1
this time , @entity14 will perform the national anthem , with @entity22 singing " my country , 't is of @entity13 " and @entity23 doing the honors on " @entity25			1
" inaugural events have spotlighted the intersection of politics , pop culture and music since the early ' 60s , said @entity31 , director of the @entity32 at @entity33			1
" the person that really changed the nature of inaugural music was @entity39 , because he was a friend with many in @entity41 -- especially @entity35 , " said @entity31 , also a @entity1 contributor			1
" @entity35 came in and co-produced one of the great shows at an inauguration ... and that became sort of the standard			1
" who will be there : celebrities flock to @entity51 for inauguration @entity39 was 43 when he was elected			1
@entity53 and @entity4 were also in their 40s for their first terms in the @entity57			2
" the younger the president , the more we see a connection to pop culture and to music , " said @entity58 , senior correspondent for @entity59			1
" @entity66 , you have it			2
@entity68 , you do n't			2
" at @entity68 's first inauguration in 1969 , the crowd was treated to " this is my country " performed by the @entity72 of @entity73 , according to the @entity74			1
@entity58 believes you can learn a lot about a commander in chief by the musical acts he chooses to spotlight			2
" @entity79 loved to portray himself as a @entity81 rancher			2
therefore , what 's a @entity81 rancher listen to ? country			1
" so @entity85 and @entity86 headlined his first inaugural celebration in 2001			1
in 1977 , @entity88 looked to his regional roots for inspiration			2
" @entity88 , he was a @entity91 , " @entity58 explains			0
" at that time , that meant the stars of @entity95 rock			0
so the @entity96 are in the @entity97			0
" sometimes the musicians are joined on stage by the president himself			0
in 1989 , @entity102 strummed a guitar with @entity104 at one of his inaugural galas , while in 1993 , @entity53 grabbed a saxophone for a duet with the @entity110 's @entity109			1
but even they were upstaged by the five members of @entity113 , who famously reunited to perform their megahit that became @entity53 's campaign song , " @entity116			1
" frontman @entity117 recalls the mood that night			0
" it was extremely exhilarating and exciting to do a song that you 've done a million times , but doing it in a completely different context			0
as we were going out with the tag , ' do n't you look back , do n't you look back , ' @entity125 comes up , and @entity128 comes up and shakes our hands			0
it was just one of those experiences you 'll never forget			0
" lessons in style from @entity135 that one performance caused @entity113 members to rethink old grievances with each other			0
" oddly enough , it did act as the catalyst for me to sort of reconsider my options , shall we say , and the band got back together , " @entity117 chuckled			0
this year 's festivities include a @entity147 on saturday and two official balls on monday night			1
performers for those events include @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 -- a mix of pop , country , @entity160 , @entity161 , rock and old - school hitmakers			0
@entity58 says @entity4 's lineup is deliberately inclusive to reflect his campaign agenda -- but it could just as easily reflect the playlist of the first family			1
" it almost looks more like they booked it by looking at the @entity171 , and then looking at the @entity172 of their daughters			0
" expect @entity4 's second - term events to be more celebratory than his first - term functions			1
" the first time around , we heard songs that had a message that you would n't have heard in previous inaugurations -- ' @entity182 , ' ' @entity183			0
' we had people reflecting on the civil rights movement , the fact that we had our first @entity188 - @entity2 president , " said @entity58			0
" now , i think it 'll be a little more up - tempo , a little peppier			0
people want a bit of a diversion as we start to think about the next four years			0
" @entity31 does n't disagree			0
" presidents often choose to make statements about who they are , and what their hopes and aspirations are through the music , through the inaugural address , through the people they bring together there			1
