-- this is n't your classic @entity3 movie where you 'll find a solitary tumbleweed rolling through a desolate landscape			2
these are neighborhoods around @entity8 , where a strange takeover of tumbleweeds started last week			1
the clusters of twisted foliage are causing a lot of problems , says @entity15 , a resident of @entity8			2
@entity15 was driving with his father , who is visiting from the @entity17 , when they came across a large pileup of tumbleweeds in his neighborhood			1
" it looked like a scene from the ' @entity24 , ' " he said			2
@entity15 , who works for the @entity26 military , has been living in the area for 14 years and said he has never seen tumbleweeds like this before			1
" they usually collect on the side of my yard , but lately they 've been piling up on top of each other , and they can get as tall as a six - foot tall fence , " he explained			1
unusually high winds are blamed for the influx of tumbleweeds into neighborhoods south of @entity8 , according to @entity0 's affiliate @entity42			1
@entity15 said they 've definitely become a nuisance for him and others in his area			2
" i do n't even know what they are or what they break off from , " he said			2
tumbleweeds can be any sort of dried up plant that , once matured , breaks off from its roots and tumbles away with the wind			1
they have collected against people 's homes , forming makeshift walls and blocking sidewalks and driveways			1
@entity63 residents are using rakes and even snowplows to clean up these pesky , dried plants , especially because they can pose a fire hazard during dry conditions			1
@entity69 , 27 , also a @entity8 resident , says tumbleweeds are a familiar sight			1
but she was surprised to find them barricading people inside their homes and even finding their way inside buildings			2
she and her daughter found a straggling tumbleweed inside a local @entity80 over the weekend , in the electronics aisle			0
@entity82 said her daughter , who is 3 , knew that tumbleweed did n't belong indoors			0
" she said , ' look mommy ! ' and she looked at me like she wanted me to fix the situation			0
" " my friends who visit are always shocked to see them , " she said			0
" there was someone who left their garage open ( on friday ) , and it was filled with them , " she said			0
as funny as this may all sound , @entity15 said that the tumbleweed situation has gotten pretty serious			0
" it becomes a problem as you are driving ; they can scratch your car			0
they can get stuck under your car , too , and you can hear it dragging underneath you , " he said			0
an active runner , he 's found himself in the past few days having to jump over tumbleweeds more than a foot tall			1
" they can be huge , and they are really prickly , " he said			0
" i 'm from the @entity17 , so when my family comes to visit me , they get a crack out of this			0
it 's like a @entity3 movie , but it is really bad			0
