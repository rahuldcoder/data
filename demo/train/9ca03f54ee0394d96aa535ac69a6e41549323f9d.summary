doctors in 2005 operated again on @entity2 to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery			2
@entity27 said thursday that the type of bypass graft used in @entity2 's 2004 surgery " has a 10 [ percent ] to 20 percent failure rate after five or six years			1
" @entity185 said thursday 's stent procedure may not be the end of @entity2 's heart woes			1
" the problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease , and sometimes it goes on and develops more , " he said			0
" there 's a substantial chance over the next three , four , five years that it could close up again			0
" @entity1 's @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
