-- @entity1 wants to practice medicine again			0
but instead , he 's laboring at an asbestos removal company in @entity4			0
for five years , @entity1 was a family medicine doctor in @entity5			0
he moved to the @entity6 in 2011 with the dream of being a doctor there			1
like many immigrants , he had a plan to live with friends to save money and to study for the exam to become medically licensed in the @entity6			1
but soon , his money ran out			0
and @entity1 found himself with less time to study and instead taking any job he could get -- from painting , to fast - food restaurants , to , now , asbestos removal			2
a doctor , not practicing medicine , in a country that is short of primary care physicians			0
@entity1 's story is common among @entity27 immigrant doctors			1
in @entity29 alone , there are an estimated 3,000 medically trained @entity27 immigrant doctors who are n't practicing medicine			1
" we had always wondered , where are the ( immigrant ) doctors from @entity38 ? " says dr. @entity32 , chairman of @entity34 's @entity33			1
" and we stumbled upon them working in menial jobs			1
" instead of treating patients , @entity32 says , many doctors spend years cleaning houses or working on construction sites and in fast - food chain restaurants			2
" we heard from one woman working at @entity47 in @entity48 , " says @entity32			2
" so she is selling fast food to people , and if she were licensed as a physician , she could be educating those same people , those same patients , on what a good diet is			0
" latino immigrant doctors have a harder time than other immigrants transitioning into the @entity6 health system , according to @entity32			1
" often they work in their own country for 10 years and then come here and they are n't licensed , and then they see how hard the process is and they have to get an odd job to support themselves			2
" it 's a costly , time - consuming process that most immigrants are n't prepared for			2
from migrant worker to neurosurgeon that 's why @entity32 and his colleague , dr. @entity68 , have developed a program at @entity34 that helps fast - track @entity27 immigrant doctors into the @entity6 health care system , the @entity74 program			1
the @entity74 program provides test prep classes and clinical observations with @entity34 doctors			1
it also covers the cost of the @entity6 medical board exam and provides a monthly stipend			1
funded by private donors , the program has helped 66 @entity27 immigrant doctors pass the board exams and get placed into residency programs in @entity29			1
in return , the doctors commit to working three years in an underserved area			2
dr. @entity91 is one of those graduates			0
he was a doctor in @entity93 with more than eight years of medical training when he moved to the @entity6 in 2005			1
but prior to last year , he was n't working in a @entity6 hospital -- or any hospital			1
instead , he was cleaning houses and installing flooring			0
" i would do anything you asked me to as long as it was legal and you paid me for it , " he says			0
@entity91 says without the help of @entity34 's @entity74 program , he would still be working odd jobs to pay the bills while juggling his time to study for the test at night			1
" it requires you study at least 10 hours a day , " says @entity91			0
" imagine you are working 10 hours a day , and then try to study 10 hours at night			0
" the stipend allowed @entity91 to stop cleaning homes and focus solely on his studies			0
he passed the @entity6 medical board exam just six months after being accepted into the program			1
today , he is a first - year resident at @entity118 in @entity29 -- a place in desperate need of doctors			0
@entity122 has just one primary care physician for every 9,000 residents , according to the hospital			0
" i personally know at least 20 more ( @entity27 immigrant ) doctors who are delivering pizza , and instead they could be working as doctors if they had the help i had , " say @entity91			1
and with @entity132 potentially adding 25 million to 30 million people to the health system , the doctor shortage is going to get worse before it gets better			1
" when 2014 rolls around , they ( @entity6 ) may have an insurance card , but where are they going to get care ? " says @entity68			2
" it is not enough to just issue an insurance card			0
" your health care is covered , but who 's going to treat you ? the problem is compounded in @entity29 because of the large immigrant population			2
" forty percent of the population here is @entity148 , but only 5 % of our doctors are @entity27			0
that is an amazing gap , " says @entity68			0
@entity32 and @entity68 say while their fast - track program may make only a small dent to help the primary care shortage in @entity38 , it 's a critical start			0
" we 're getting dozens of applications daily , and we accept as many candidates as we can financially support in the program , " says @entity68 " we need these doctors in @entity38			2
" @entity1 has applied to the @entity74 program and is waiting to hear if he gets accepted			0
until then , he 'll continue to work at the asbestos removal company during the day , and study for the @entity6 medical boards at night			1
but he says no matter how long it takes , he wo n't give up on his dream to practice medicine in the @entity6 .			2
