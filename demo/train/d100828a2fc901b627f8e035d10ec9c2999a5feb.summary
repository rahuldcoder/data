-- i 've returned to @entity2 after a long time away in my home in @entity4 to get a sense of the political mood in the run - up to the 2016 presidential election			1
and i 'm pretty depressed to discover that everyone is talking about @entity10			1
it 's not that he would n't make a strong candidate for the @entity14			1
it 's that the thought of a third @entity10 in the @entity17 feels distinctly un-american			1
like you 're all giving up on the whole " revolution " thing in favor of @entity22 - style aristocracy			0
speculation was reignited -- one suspects entirely by accident -- when @entity26 told @entity27 that his father is " giving [ the presidency ] serious thought and moving ... forward			0
" i 've heard the opposite , that the candidate has n't quite got the requisite enthusiasm			0
he also has plenty of weaknesses hidden by the fact that he has n't declared yet ( voters are always far keener on people who are n't officially running than those who are )			0
as @entity43 wrote in the @entity44 , the former @entity42 governor 's polling is unspectacular , he disagrees with the @entity14 base on some important issues and his patrician tone is better - suited to a general election than to a primary campaign			1
having said that , @entity10 would still be a more than worthy addition to the race that right now is full of newbies to national politics ( @entity54 , @entity55 , etc. )			1
he has gravitas , executive experience in a major state and a record of winning votes among the groups to which @entity14 know they need to reach out			2
@entity10 speaks @entity63 , his wife was born in @entity64 and he took an astonishing 61 % of the @entity66 vote in the 1998 governor 's race			1
there 's a case for putting @entity10 on the ticket just to win @entity42 back : its growing , @entity74 , @entity66 population helped give it to @entity76 in 2008 and 2012			1
but there is one big argument against a @entity10 candidacy : his name			2
i hate to sound so superficial , but i sense that it does matter for a whole host of complex psychological reasons			0
it brings back memories of his brother , @entity87 , who polls suggest is blamed by a significant number of people for @entity93 's problems			2
if the race is @entity10 vs. @entity96 in 2016 , then it 's a clash of nostalgias -- and @entity93 ' feelings about the @entity96 years are probably a lot warmer than they are about the @entity10 ones			1
it 's job security vs. credit crunch and relative peace vs. endless war			2
the irony is that @entity10 is probably politically a little more polished than either his brother or even father ( he does n't suffer from the strange verbal tics of @entity87 and @entity109 -- recall that the family patriarch once told people that he 'd had " some sex " with @entity113 )			1
but by sheer coincidence of running for office after them , he will be associated with their myriad weaknesses			0
moreover , family matriarch @entity118 was quite correct when she said that there was something innately unsettling about the thought of yet another @entity10 running for the presidency			2
last year , she told @entity123 that although @entity10 was the best candidate available ( that 's a proud mom speaking ) : " i think it 's a great country , there are a lot of great families , and it 's not just four families whatever			1
there are other people out there that are very qualified , and we 've had enough @entity135			0
" the same could be said about the @entity136 , but you probably wo n't find a @entity96 modest enough to say it			2
@entity118 has stopped saying it , according to the @entity140 , because the family has asked her to quit			0
@entity93 is supposed to be a democracy and , as such , its citizens should not tolerate aristocratic oligarchs lightly			0
if @entity10 ran and won , there would have been no decade without a @entity10 in the @entity17 since the 1970s			0
and no @entity14 ticket would have won without a @entity10 or a @entity147 on it since 1928			1
it 's perfectly possible that the @entity10 family is uniquely talented			1
but it 's more likely that a dearth of political talent in the @entity93 has allowed them to concentrate far too much power in their hands			0
that they might go up against the @entity136 in 2016 makes journalists salivate at the prospect of a " grudge match			0
" but is it really healthy for @entity93 democracy forever to be looking backward ? especially at a moment in time when politics is defined by gridlock , i sense that @entity2 , and the rest of the country , is exhausted by old battles over policy			1
what 's needed is a fresh new start			2
that might translate into a vote for youth ( @entity175 ) , for a new philosophical direction ( @entity177 or @entity55 ) or for the elevation of a " common man " who gets the middle - class ( @entity179 )			0
what i doubt it 'll mean is the keys of the @entity17 returning to the @entity10 family			0
for all their undoubted service to the presidency , they do n't own it .			0

@entity190 : it 's depressing to hear people talking about @entity10 and a possible 2016 run
he says @entity10 has merits compared to @entity14 newbies
but a @entity10 vs. @entity96 race would be a giant step backward in time , @entity190 says
@entity190 : @entity2 exhausted by old policy battles , *players* ; needs fresh ideas , new start
