@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 downplayed @entity4 's decision to not follow through on threatened retaliation to its live - fire military drill this week as political maneuvering , according to a key @entity1 military official			1
@entity0 is working to adjust its security approach , believing that @entity4 might launch less conventional attacks -- including possible terrorist strikes on large civilian gatherings , according to the @entity1 government official			1
@entity1 might also strengthen its intelligence capability , the official said , calling it increasingly crucial to its defense			2
the @entity1 live - fire naval drill ended peacefully monday after an hour and 34 minutes			2
after once threatening the exercise could spur a war , @entity23 leaders said retaliation was n't necessary but issued a stern warning to @entity1 and the @entity26 , according to the state - run @entity27			1
the key @entity1 government official dismissed @entity4 's lack of military response as a calculated political decision to build goodwill with @entity33 , @entity34 and other allies			1
in recent days , the @entity23 agreed to allow @entity37 inspectors access to its uranium - enrichment facility and take other steps that could defuse tension if implemented , including consideration of the formation of a military commission between @entity4 , @entity1 and the @entity26			1
those steps generated at least the possibility of rare optimism on the @entity46 , which has been gripped by anxiety since the sinking of a @entity1 warship killed 46 sailors in march			2
tensions rose higher last month , when @entity4 shelled @entity52 , killing two @entity1 marines and two civilians			1
the @entity23 has accused the @entity1 of provoking the @entity52 attack because shells from a @entity1 military drill landed in the @entity59 's waters			1
the latest developments in @entity4 came amid a visit to @entity4 by @entity62 , the former @entity26 ambassador to the @entity37 and current governor of @entity64			2
@entity62 was acting as a private citizen and not a @entity26 envoy " maybe we had a little impact with them , " he said monday of the @entity4 leaders			0
but the @entity1 government official viewed @entity62 's visit skeptically , saying @entity72 took advantage of the governor			1
@entity0 had no official reactions to two proposals -- one to set up a hotline between @entity1 and @entity23 leaders and another to have a commission to settle simmering disputes before they flared into full - on military confrontations -- that @entity62 said @entity4 leaders were receptive to			1
still , the fact that @entity72 agreed to consider engaging in a multilateral dialogue with other nations through the commission is significant , said @entity87 , a professor at the @entity89 's school of public and international affairs and director of the university 's @entity91 for the @entity93			1
dialogue between the @entity23 alone is " less desirable , because the two are very highly emotionally charged			0
it 's like a family feud , if you will , " said @entity87 , a frequent visitor to @entity4 who has close , regular contact with high - ranking @entity4 officials			2
that 's why the addition of other nations -- the @entity26 and possibly even @entity33 -- is necessary , he said			0
@entity87 said such a commission would likely discuss one of the most pressing issues -- the boundary in territorial waters			0
" i think that will continue to be a source of problems , " @entity87 said			0
@entity4 's nuclear program might also be discussed , he said			1
there also was talk about creating a hotline between the two nation 's militaries " to avert potential crises , " according to a statement from @entity62			0
but @entity87 noted that hotlines have previously been in place , but when tensions escalate , both sides will cut off the line			0
@entity62 and others emphasized to @entity4 leaders that failing to retaliate after the exercise would cast them in a positive light , he said			0
" i am encouraged by the news that @entity4 will not react militarily to @entity1 's drills , " @entity62 said in the statement			1
" during my meetings in @entity72 , i repeatedly pressed @entity4 not to retaliate			0
" @entity87 said he believes that the lack of retaliation by @entity4 , while " a welcome sign , " is a strategic move aimed at good public relations			1
" they were taking the high road , so to speak , " he said			0
" i think they 're trying to win the hearts and minds of the people in @entity1 as well as around the world			0
" public relations is " very high on @entity4 's agenda , " he added			1
the @entity148 welcomed the @entity59 's muted response			1
" this is the way countries are supposed to act , " @entity148 spokesman @entity150 said			0
" the @entity1 exercise was defensive in nature			2
the @entity4 were notified in advance			0
there was no basis for a belligerent response			0
" asked whether @entity4 could be waiting for its southern neighbor to drop its guard before retaliating , @entity62 told @entity2 that is possible but said he thinks the fact that @entity72 " took responsible action " shows they are moving into a new chapter			0
" i think they deserve credit for holding back , " he said			0
" i think @entity4 may be sending a signal that they 're ready to re-engage after having behaved very negatively			0
" @entity62 , accompanied by @entity2 's @entity169 , wrapped up a five - day unofficial trip to @entity4 this week			2
the @entity1 military remained on high alert after the drill ended and is observing the @entity59 carefully , the country 's @entity171 said monday			1
during the drill , fighter jets took to the sky in preparation for possible @entity4 retaliation , according to the @entity1 defense ministry			1
the @entity1 president 's office defended the drill monday , saying , " in a divided country that is militarily pitted against each other , it is natural that as a sovereign country , we will conduct military exercises and defend our territory			2
" the military exercise took place in waters just south of @entity52			0
after the drill ended , @entity4 state - run media reported why the @entity59 did not react militarily : " the revolutionary armed forces of the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) did not feel any need to retaliate against every despicable military provocation like one taking revenge after facing a blow , " @entity27 reported @entity23 officials as saying monday			1
" the second and third powerful retaliatory strike to be made by the revolutionary armed forces of the @entity4 knowing no limit as declared before the world will lead to blowing up the bases of the @entity26 and @entity1 puppet warmongers			1
" @entity4 military officials also said the @entity26 and @entity1 perpetuated military provocation , " far from drawing a lesson from the disgraceful defeat they suffered " from the @entity52 shelling , according to @entity27			2
@entity1 has not said whether any additional naval drills are imminent			0
@entity33 's deputy permanent representative to the @entity37 , @entity214 , has reiterated @entity33 's call for both @entity216 to return to the negotiating table			0
@entity33 is the isolated @entity59 's sole major ally and provides it with a crucial fuel and food lifeline			1
@entity2 's @entity220 and @entity221 in @entity0 ; @entity222 and @entity223 at the @entity37 ; @entity224 in @entity225 ; and @entity226 in @entity227 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 official calls @entity4 's lack of retaliation " political posturing "
@entity235 says @entity0 will adjust its defensive tactics , *fearing* less conventional attacks
@entity59 's consideration of *multi-nation* dialogue is significant , a professor says
@entity4 issues stern warning but says retaliation was not necessary
