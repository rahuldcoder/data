editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive officer of @entity3 and chairman of @entity5 llc. the companies are aimed at an audience of @entity10 and urban consumers , and they own 53 radio stations in 16 cities , a cable network and a variety of web sites			1
@entity2 personally has contributed to @entity18 's campaign			1
@entity2 says the black population in @entity20 has grown increasingly diverse			1
( @entity21 ) -- if you think african - americans will come out in greater numbers than ever before to vote for @entity18 , you 're probably right			0
if you think you know how they 'll vote in the almost 500 @entity27 , @entity28 and gubernatorial races , you could be in for a surprise			0
although politicians and their advertising gurus often speak to @entity10 as a collective , homogeneous group , the black population is anything but a monolith			1
in the past decade , the more than 40 million strong black population in @entity20 has become increasingly diverse : economically , socially , technologically and even philosophically			1
in the final push toward @entity42 , as politicians and political hopefuls seek to penetrate this community , they may no longer understand to whom they are speaking			0
are they addressing blacks or african - americans ? is racial prejudice as important an issue today as affording a college education for their kids or taking care of an aging parent ? ireport.com : black college cancels class to vote @entity3 , the country 's largest broadcasting company primarily targeting african - americans , recently commissioned a study to uncover @entity10 today			1
how do they identify themselves ? what do they care about ? how are they influenced ? what is most important to them ? interestingly , the study found that 42 percent of those polled actually prefer to be called black ( these are more likely to be more affluent ) compared with 44 percent who choose to be described as @entity10			0
and yes , it would be misguided to assume that dropping a @entity69 quote into a speech and focusing on @entity20 's history of racial inequality is the sure way to sway black voters when one - third of blacks , particularly younger people , believe that there is actually too much focus on past oppression			1
and as insulting as it is to assume that all women vote for female candidates , it is equally inaccurate and offensive to say that blacks simply cast their ballots for people of color			0
like all @entity20 , black folks vote on the issues they care about , and today those issues are less likely to be linked to race than they are to the economy , health care , education and a whole spectrum of social issues			1
as @entity100 sociology professor @entity99 recently said , " black people do n't vote for candidates just because they are black			0
if @entity101 ran for president , he would get five black votes			0
" given @entity10 's extreme diversity today ( the study identified 11 specific groups ) it is easy to misunderstand who they are and how they can be reached			0
yes , discrimination and racial issues are still incredibly important , particularly to middle - age and older blacks			0
but the younger populations are more concerned about starting their own businesses , paying for their education , taking care of their children and creating a better work / life balance			0
so how do politicians penetrate the multiple segments of @entity10 ? in 1992 , when @entity124 wooed african - americans in church , he understood how to effectively reach that population			2
but that was before social networking sites attracted millions of teenage and young black adults			2
now that the digital divide has faded , with roughly the same percentage of blacks online as the general population , ignoring black web sites and social networking sites would be a big mistake			2
although the history of black oppression in @entity20 is not the radioactive issue it once was , trust in the community -- whom blacks trust -- is still paramount			1
of all institutions , they are least likely to trust credit card companies but also remain seriously wary of the mainstream media and tend to trust black media more than traditional media outlets			0
it has been almost a century and a half since blacks in @entity20 won the right to vote			2
it makes all the sense in the world that the black community has evolved and diversified over the years , but too often politicians make the mistake of assuming that blacks are still a monolithic group fixated on all of the same issues			2
though @entity18 will be able to count on a massive percentage of the black vote on @entity42 , the rest of the ticket will need to dig deeper than the canned speeches dealing with racial injustice of the past to satisfy today 's black voters			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity175 : @entity20 's black population has become more diverse
40 million population represents many different social , economic viewpoints , he says
@entity2 : discrimination still key issue , but other concerns have emerged
@entity2 says politicians need to know that past appeals to race are *outdated*
