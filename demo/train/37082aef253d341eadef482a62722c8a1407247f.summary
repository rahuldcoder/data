-- @entity1 is a wonderful thing when it spurs struggling people to aspire to better circumstances and a more promising future , lifting communities out of poverty			0
but combined with misinformation , opportunistic politics and outright fraud , hope can be one of the cruelest harbingers of misery			0
and this is the role of hope on the border these days			1
what is drawing thousands of children to @entity20 's doorstep unaccompanied by their parents , aunts , uncles or anyone else they know is hope			1
what is prompting their loving families to send them on perilous , expensive journeys over hundreds of miles in the hands of strange men is hope			0
but what is awaiting them is confusion , conflict and despair			0
so how did this strange confluence of expectations and suffering begin ? and what is going to happen now ? here , in a series of short questions , is how this witch 's brew was mixed			0
fast facts : immigration 1			0
what is happening on the border ? in simple terms , a flood of children has been pouring across the 1,900 mile @entity20 border with @entity55 , children who are accompanied by neither their parents nor proper documentation for immigration			1
the primary problem is the sheer volume			0
in a normal year , immigration authorities would expect to apprehend and process about 8,000 undocumented children , according to federal officials			1
this year that number has soared to almost 60,000 , with children ranging from very young to teenagers			1
by the time the year is over , officials expect 90,000 unaccompanied minors will have trekked into the @entity20			1
that 's more than enough to fill the @entity72 stadium			0
no one knows what next year will bring , but some estimates suggest it will be even worse if nothing can be done to stem the flow			0
that explosive growth in the caseload has overwhelmed holding facilities , case investigators , and most importantly the immigration courts that must decide what happens with these children			2
5 things to know about immigration 2			0
why kids ? because parents in some @entity91 countries believe if their children can get to @entity20 , they will be given citizenship			1
communities protest surge of kids 3			2
where did they get that idea ? from president @entity100 , to hear @entity101 ( and some @entity102 ) tell it			1
they say he has sent mixed messages about how undocumented immigrants will be treated			0
although his administration has thrown out so many people for illegal entry that he is known in some @entity111 communities as the deporter - in - chief , he has also told @entity113 to exercise " discretion " in terms of deporting young people			2
this was the @entity119 response after @entity120 failed to pass the so called @entity121 , which would have allowed many children to stay who were brought here illegally by their parents and who frankly had little or no knowledge of their " home " countries			1
in any event , critics believe the president 's actions launched a subtle message south of the border : send your kids and we 'll let them stay			1
what else could explain the problem ? president @entity140			1
in 2008 , just before he left office , he signed a law to protect children from human trafficking , from being sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude			2
the law stipulates that children who are caught in the @entity20 illegally and who come from countries other than @entity55 and @entity151 should get full hearings on their status			1
to wit : they can argue for asylum instead of being immediately deported			0
that 's why the current border rush is being principally driven by children from @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
those children qualify for this treatment			2
the catch ? the courts that hold the hearings are so backed up that this process can last years , during which time these children can attend school , live in the @entity20 with relatives or family friends , eat at @entity172 and generally enjoy a full , @entity20 lifestyle			1
what 's the difference between immigrant and refugee ? 5			0
so between @entity140 and @entity100 , does that pretty much cover the cause for all this ? no. @entity182 problems of poverty , gangs and crime have made more families in @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 desperate to get their children to a better place			1
all three nations have beautiful scenery , lovely people and stratospheric crime rates			0
the @entity161 city of @entity194 is arguably the single most likely place on the planet for a person to be murdered , higher than many @entity20 cities including @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 or @entity202			1
all indications are that smugglers , who can charge thousands of dollars to transport a young person to the @entity20 , are more than happy to fan the flames of hope by suggesting such schemes to escape these dangerous places really will work			1
will they ? strangely enough , maybe			0
some unknown percentage of these children will probably successfully argue for asylum			2
but beyond that , the politics make it all murky			2
the president 's team does not want to appear heartless , especially with children involved			2
simultaneously , they do n't want it to look like they were illegally " played " for citizenship			2
they are in a tough spot , and @entity101 critics are making it tougher because that 's what opponents do in @entity232			0
who will win and what that will mean to the fate of the children is anyone 's guess			2
so what 's happening now ? the president has asked @entity120 for $ 3.7 billion to set up new places to hold all these children , to speed up the processing of their cases , and to strengthen the border against new arrivals			1
@entity101 want a cheaper program that includes even more dramatic streamlining of the deportation process and even more robust border protection measures			0
people on both sides of the political debate say emphatically that the well - being of these children must be taken very seriously			1
but beyond that , the situation is still a mess and there is not yet any agreement about what to do next			0
and still the kids keep coming , across the rivers , over the mountains , through the deserts , with little more than their family 's hopes in hand			0
immigration crisis is a political conundrum share your immigration stories			0
