@entity0 , @entity1 -- ever since it happened , race has been front - and - center in the vigorous debate over the fatal shooting of @entity8 teenager @entity7 by a white police officer			1
could it also factor into those 12 people now deciding whether that @entity0 , @entity1 , officer will face charges in the 18 - year - old 's death ? we may never know			1
that 's because the @entity19 grand jury weighing the case meets , per established rules , in private			2
still , at least we found out friday about a little more about those on it -- including their race			2
@entity28 administrator @entity27 said there are three african - americans -- one male , two females -- and nine whites -- six males , three females -- on the 12 - member panel			0
there are a total of seven men and five women			0
no information was given about the ages or occupations of any on the grand jury			0
this information on the jury 's makeup comes as a key complaint among @entity7 family supporters continues : that the man whose office is tasked with making the case to the grand jury -- @entity19 prosecuting attorney @entity54 -- is too cozy with law enforcement , does not have a good relationship with the @entity8 - @entity8 community and thus should be replaced			1
for his part , @entity54 has indicated he wo n't recuse himself , saying he 's simply doing the job he was elected to do			0
the county grand jury was randomly selected from an approved pool and has been seated since may according @entity27 , the director of judicial administration for the @entity28			0
in many locales , grand juries hear numerous cases during their terms , which cover a specified period of time instead of the duration of a specific case			0
unlike a jury in a criminal case , which convicts someone if jurors are convinced of guilt " beyond a reasonable doubt , " a grand jury decides if there is " probable cause " -- based on testimony and evidence presented , in the absence of a judge -- to charge someone with a crime			0
in @entity1 , they do n't have to be unanimous to press such an indictment , as long as nine of the 12 agree on a charge			0
notably , these grand jurors are n't the only ones with a pivotal say in whether or not officer @entity93 is charged			1
the federal government is also on the case -- @entity97 agents canvassing the @entity0 neighborhood where the shooting happened have knocked on more than 400 doors and interviewed more than 200 people , according to law enforcement sources -- as part of the @entity106 's civil rights division 's investigation			1
the federal probe , as currently set up , must prove there was an element of " racial hostility " ( as explained by @entity2 senior legal analyst @entity111 ) in the shooting			0
that 's a higher standard than the one before the @entity19 grand jury			0
this is one big reason why the 12 people on it -- including who they are , what they hear and what they believe -- matters so much			0
they may be the first to reach a decision on whether officer @entity93 will get justice , whether that 's defined as a murder charge , a lesser charge , or no charge at all			1
@entity97 probing cyberattacks on police in @entity0 as the grand jury hears testimony and sees evidence in private , tensions and protest continue to play out in a very public way on the streets of @entity0			1
protesters demanding @entity93 's arrest have ripped law enforcement for what they call an overly militarized , heavy - handed response ; on the other side , police called out criminal elements for fomenting unrest and said they simply wanted to protect people , safeguard property and keep the peace			1
whoever is to blame , many nights since the august 9 shooting have been marred by large - scale arrests and violence			0
but that was not the case thursday night into early friday			1
there were no @entity158 cocktails thrown , no shootings , no fires , no tear gas			0
instead , a sense of much - welcomed calm prevailed			0
this came hours after @entity1 gov. @entity165 ordered the withdrawal of @entity168 troops -- who had been dispatched to protect he police command center , which officials said had come under threat -- from the @entity28 suburb			1
that may not have been the only threat -- real or virtual -- to police			0
three @entity178 law enforcement officials told @entity2 on friday that the @entity97 has opened an investigation into hacking attacks directed at the personal computers and accounts of police officers who have been part of the response			1
the attacks are believed to be the work of hackers affiliated with the group @entity189 , the officials said			1
it 's not clear how much personal data was compromised by these alleged cyberattacks , but it 's one reason why officers working the streets of @entity0 are n't displaying their names on their uniforms , according to the officials			1
credibility of key witness challenged supporters of @entity93 have used reports this week that the teen broke the cop 's eye socket during an altercation as justification for the use of deadly force			1
those reports are not true , a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told @entity2			1
@entity93 had a swollen face and was treated at the hospital , but his eye socket was not fractured in the reported scuffle with @entity7 , the source told @entity2			1
the shooting has prompted multiple investigations , but already -- before any charges have been filed or conclusions reached -- the credibility of those linked to the case is being scrutinized in the court of public opinion			0
@entity224 , a friend of @entity7 's who was walking with him at the time of the incident and a key witness , said the officer shot @entity7 once by the police car and again as he ran away			2
according to @entity224 , @entity7 was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting			2
other witnesses have said @entity7 's body jerked as if it had been hit from the back , but an autopsy shows that all the entry wounds were in the front of @entity7 's body			2
this , together with reports that @entity224 had a criminal record that including lying to police , has put his credibility in question			2
@entity224 's version was contrasted by the version of events described by a woman who told a @entity28 radio show she was a friend of the officer : that @entity7 taunted @entity93 and charged at him before the shooting began			2
the radio caller 's account matches what @entity93 has told investigators , a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told @entity2			2
in the event there is a criminal trial , any potential juror who hears @entity224 's version might take his past into consideration but must remember that the @entity97 and police were aware of his past when they interviewed him initially , said @entity268 , one of @entity224 's attorneys			1
another of his lawyers , @entity272 , defended his client 's credibility friday morning			0
" his credibility in this case has nothing to do with what he 's been charged with in the past			0
it has to do with what he saw here , seeing his friend get murdered , in cold blood , by a police officer , " @entity272 told @entity2 's @entity281			2
" we have two young men chased after to be hunted down by a police officer , one of them murdered in the street , and this becomes about their past ? or this becomes about what happened at a store ? none of this is what it should be about , " @entity272 said			2

@entity2 's @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 contributed to this report .			0
