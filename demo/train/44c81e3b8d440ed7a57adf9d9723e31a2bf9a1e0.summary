on tuesday morning , @entity0 materialized on a telepresence robot , beaming in to an auditorium in @entity3 from an undisclosed location in @entity5			1
the former @entity7 contractor assailed agency surveillance programs in an interview with @entity10 , curator of the @entity13 conference , and then , via robot , roamed the corridors of the @entity16 , randomly encountering people ( including @entity19 co-founder @entity18 ) attending the conference			1
on thursday morning , @entity7 deputy director @entity21 also appeared by video feed at the conference to counter @entity0 's remarks , but the video connection was so poor that the session had to be interrupted , to be resumed more than an hour later			1
@entity21 ultimately told the conference that @entity0 had put lives at risk by disclosing the agency 's methods to @entity33 's enemies and showed " amazing arrogance " in defying the judgment of the three branches of the @entity33 government , which he said had blessed the surveillance programs			1
@entity0 had argued that surveillance invaded privacy without benefit and that technology companies must encrypt private data ( @entity19 announced thursday that it was increasing the security of @entity46 in response to the @entity7 revelations )			1
people deserve a right to privacy from government oversight when they order a book online , call their families or take a trip , @entity0 said			1
the contrast , in message and in the power and limits of technology , captured one of the central dynamics of this year 's @entity13 conference : the remarkable things people can accomplish with 21st century machines and the very real and often unresolved questions that result			1
the 30th anniversary gathering for the organization built around the subjects of its acronym -- technology , entertainment and design -- has been to a large extent focused on the " t " part			1
inventor @entity78 looked two decades ahead to a time when , he argued , people will use nanobots to connect the capillaries of their brains to the cloud , merging biological thinking with artificial intelligence and enabling a leap in human capabilities equivalent to the great advances of millions of years of evolution			2
@entity92 co-founder @entity91 predicted people will learn languages , and the plays of @entity96 , by ingesting a pill			2
@entity101 punter @entity100 , wearing @entity98 on stage , forecast the rise of virtual reality and augmented reality in pro sports , enabling fans to literally feel the action on the field			2
science writer @entity109 showed how technological advances , including synthetic running tracks and high - tech uniforms , help enable today 's athletes to zoom past the records of history 's great sports figures			2
giving evidence of the power of technology , @entity117 , the head of the @entity119 research group at the @entity92 , walked confidently on bionic legs around the stage as he gave his @entity125 wednesday			1
@entity117 's legs were amputated after he suffered frostbite from a mountain climbing expedition			2
he noted that he can make his height adjustable , from as little as 5 feet , to as tall as he 'd like , depending on the occasion			2
and @entity117 predicted that bionics will eventually be an everyday tool for many people -- with , for example , exoskeletons designed for running			2
" machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient			2
" in perhaps the emotional highlight of the conference , @entity117 told the story of a ballroom dancer whose left leg was amputated in last year 's bombing at the @entity145			1
in 200 days , @entity117 led a team at @entity92 that created a prosthetic limb , designed especially for her			2
and , indeed , @entity149 danced onstage for the first time since the bombing at the end of @entity117 's talk			1
@entity117 struck a defiant note against the violence of terrorism , as well as other things that hold people back : " humans are not disabled ; our built environments , our technologies are disabled			0
" and in the ultimate statement of technological optimism , @entity13 announced that it will help support a new @entity164 , which will be presented to " the first artificial intelligence to come to this stage and give a @entity125 compelling enough to win a standing ovation from the audience			1
" @entity13 's @entity10 said the aim is to see whether the computing power of a @entity172 - style computer can be combined with enough creativity to develop ideas , though he conceded it may take decades			0
the ethics of technology were just as evident an issue in @entity16 as its possibilities			1
sir @entity180 , who invented the @entity181 , urged that the @entity181 's 25th anniversary be used as an occasion to develop a @entity184 that establishes basic rights to privacy and free speech online			0
in an interview at @entity13 with @entity190 , @entity19 co-founder and chief executive @entity188 said he was " tremendously disappointed " that the @entity33 government did n't fully disclose its surveillance programs			0
asked about the issue of privacy and data collection by companies like @entity19 , he said " the main thing we need to do on privacy is just provide people choice			0
" he argued that privacy needs to be balanced with the benefits of sharing information			0
page , who suffers from partly paralyzed vocal cords , said , " when i had this problem with my voice , i was scared to share it			0
" he said his @entity19 - co founder @entity18 encouraged him to go public with the news , and @entity204 said much useful information was exchanged about the condition			0
" would n't it be great to have medical records online anonymously ? " he said , so people could research doctors and treatments			0
retired gen. @entity218 was also focused on sharing information in his talk			1
a culture of secrecy is crippling for a team that needs to recognize and respond to threats , he said			0
" sharing is power ... i am more afraid of a bureaucrat who keeps information in a desk drawer than of someone who leaks			0
" the @entity7 deputy director , @entity21 , said leaks like @entity0 's do damage , but also conceded that the @entity7 has n't been as transparent on its programs as it should have been			1
he said the threats the agency combats today include cyberwar and the stealing of companies ' intellectual property by nations that use it to empower their state - owned enterprises			0
computer hacking was cited as a force for good by @entity246 , a security researcher at @entity247			0
she conceded some hackers give in to the temptation to read personal e-mails or add zeroes to their bank accounts			0
but she argued hackers are the immune system for the information age , experts at revealing the vulnerability of the @entity181			0
" they force us to fix things or demand something better , she said			0
" it 's not information that wants to be free , it 's us			0
" @entity246 recalled that she saw @entity7 head gen. @entity266 speak at a hackers ' convention -- not to denounce hackers but to make a hiring pitch , but at @entity13 , she offered the following advice : " then stop arresting us			1
