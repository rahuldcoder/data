@entity0 -- president @entity3 's abrupt change of course and decision to ask @entity6 to authorize a strike on @entity8 won praise from some who have bitterly opposed his foreign policy			1
but in his surprise decision , did @entity3 cede presidential power ? over the last 50 years , presidents have successfully consolidated power when it comes to foreign affairs , especially when use of the @entity20 military is concerned			1
some say the concession to @entity6 sets a new precedent that bodes well for future @entity24 and not so well for future presidents			1
" this is a big deal and will tie the hands of future presidents , " said @entity26 , law professor at @entity27			0
@entity26 said this is the first time a president has sought authorization from @entity6 for a limited military mission			1
he said it will limit the flexibility of future presidents to make quick decisions , potentially putting @entity20 national security at risk			0
draft resolution on @entity8 would limit strike to 60 days " that kind of decision - making does n't work when you have 535 monday morning quarterbacks , " @entity26 said , referring to the number of lawmakers who will have a vote on @entity8 intervention as early as next week			1
@entity3 maintains , however , that he is not ceding his authority , but made the decision because " the country will be stronger " if @entity6 is on board			1
@entity3 insists he still has the authority to act unilaterally			2
" [ @entity56 ] believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , " he said saturday when he announced he would seek @entity6 ' support			1
@entity3 and unilateralism other legal analysts disagree , however , with @entity63 's assessment that the president is diluting the power of the office			1
on the legal blog @entity69 , @entity68 professor @entity67 wrote : " what would have been unprecedented , and a huge development for separation of powers , is a unilateral strike in @entity8			0
" @entity76 , a @entity77 professor , agreed			0
she argued that the president had to seek @entity6 ' approval because he did n't have support from the @entity82 @entity81			1
@entity3 looks to @entity6 to bolster legal case for @entity8 strike " going to war under these circumstances ( without congressional or @entity81 support ) would have put him out on a limb politically and legally , " @entity76 said			1
@entity88 , who was press secretary for president @entity89 , sided with @entity3			2
he said on @entity1 's " @entity90 " that this is " a voluntary exercise where the executive has said to the legislature , ' i want you to act			0
' " a return to precedent ? presidential historian @entity97 said the president " returned to a central part of the country 's history " of power - sharing that has " a complicated history			0
" he said presidents @entity104 and @entity105 would never have considered sidestepping @entity6 in the lead - up to @entity107 or @entity108 respectively			2
presidents moved away from asking @entity6 ' permission in the 1950s , starting with the @entity111 , when president @entity112 declined to seek congressional authorization			2
@entity6 historian @entity114 called the move " the single most important precedent for the executive use of military force without @entity120 authority			2
" instead , @entity112 gained support from the @entity81 and @entity6 did not object			2
president @entity122 further consolidated power by authorizing the @entity124 to carry out the @entity126 invasion of @entity127 and by his actions in the 1962 standoff with the @entity130 over the @entity20 blockade of @entity127			0
president @entity132 boxed out @entity6 with the 1964 @entity133 , which gave @entity132 broad authority without forcing him to declare war			2
he used the law to unilaterally decide to commit 100,000 troops in the first stage of the war against @entity140			0
as a result , @entity6 passed the @entity142 of 1973 to rein in presidents ' war declarations			1
the law says the president must " consult " with @entity6 before @entity20 forces are committed in an overseas conflict or within 60 days of @entity20 involvement			2
@entity6 ' use of the @entity142 is mixed , however			2
while president @entity89 sought congressional approval for wars in @entity154 and @entity155 , presidents have often failed to ask @entity6 for support for smaller incursions			1
president @entity159 did n't seek authorization for @entity161 and @entity162 , president @entity158 avoided @entity6 over military action in @entity164 and @entity165 , and @entity3 sidestepped the legislative branch for an expanded war in @entity155 and intervention in @entity169			1
opinion : @entity3 , ignore the polls on @entity8 what if @entity6 turns down the president ? the most immediate risk for the president is that the @entity6 says no , as @entity177 's @entity176 did to prime minister @entity178 last week			1
@entity88 warned that @entity3 " has to prevail on the vote			0
" @entity97 said it would be " rare " that @entity6 would not defer to the president on an issue of war			0
he pointed to one instance in 1939 , in the lead - up to @entity108 , when the president failed to gain @entity6 ' support to aid the @entity188 and @entity189 against @entity190			0
shortly after , @entity6 reversed course and gave @entity105 the resources he wanted			0
@entity8 war resolution faces tough challenge in @entity6 while @entity3 's decision will be debated for years , @entity6 ' response could be the real precedent - setter			1
during testimony before the @entity200 on tuesday , secretary of state @entity198 said congressional rejection would harm @entity20 standing among its allies while emboldening its enemies			0
as of now , @entity6 is n't completely sold on intervention in @entity8			0
if a failed vote falls along party lines , @entity76 said " partisan squabbling would make future presidents nervous " about seeking congressional authority			0
@entity97 quoted @entity212 historian @entity211 , who said , " history is an argument without end			0
" in other words , future congresses and presidents ( and observers ) are likely to use @entity3 's action and @entity6 ' response as evidence bolstering a position			1
opinion : on @entity8 , @entity3 must show strong grip @entity1 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0

past presidents have successfully taken military action without @entity6 ' approval
one expert says decision will result in " 535 monday morning quarterbacks " in @entity6
other legal *scholars* say @entity3 going it alone would put him on limb legally and politically
