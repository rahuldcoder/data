two weeks ago i visited the @entity1 at @entity3 's @entity2 , to appear on a radio show being broadcast from there			1
after the interview , i lingered , wandering around the national stands , savoring the @entity9 hip - hop that blared from the speakers			1
i stood in line to receive an inscription -- carefully traced out on paper by a cheerful , elderly man wielding a quill pen -- of my name in @entity17 and @entity18			2
so you can imagine my shock when i heard news of the premature closure of the @entity1 -- fallout of a debt row involving the company managing events at the village , and a key supplier			1
for me that tragic turn of events symbolizes all that is wrong with sports administration in many @entity32 countries			1
government funds meant to help @entity9 's contingent prepare for @entity35 -- a total of $ 14 million , according to sports minister @entity37 -- were n't released to the ministry until april , just three months before the opening ceremony			1
@entity37 himself was only drafted to the ministry in december 2011 , in an acting capacity ; his substantive appointment was not announced until may			1
now i 'm not a sports technocrat , but something in the realm of common sense suggests to me that the @entity48 are generally won and lost long before the opening ceremony cauldron is touched by fire			1
watch : games medals versus gdp @entity9 , an unrepentantly heavy trader in the stock market of optimism , went to @entity3 the way it likes to travel to global engagements ( be they sporting events or climate change summits ) -- eschewing serious preparation , expecting the best , and inevitably attracting the worst , which actually varies in degree depending on the amount of good luck in the air			1
in the end , the opening ceremony march - past turned out to be the high point of our @entity35 performance			1
from a tally of four medals in @entity75 ( 1 silver and 3 bronze ) we dropped into medal-less oblivion in @entity3			2
as with @entity9 , so has it been with @entity78 ( @entity78 's last @entity48 medal was its @entity81 bronze in the men 's soccer event )			1
@entity85 , with a much better @entity48 record , has also disappointed in @entity3			0
the east @entity32 country , 13th on the medals table four years ago , with a total of 14 medals , all in long - distance athletics ( six of which were golds ) , dropped to 28th place in @entity3 , with 11 medals ( only two of which were golds )			1
from the tales of woe filtering out from the various national camps one might be forgiven for assuming it 's the same set of officials managing the @entity9 , @entity78 and the @entity85			1
@entity105 's problems are of a slightly different nature -- seven of its athletes vanished from camp two weeks into the @entity110 , presumably envisaging brighter prospects as asylum - seekers than as home - bound olympians			0
across the continent there will be much handwringing and gnashing of teeth in the weeks and months to come			0
governments will set up probe panels and probe panels to probe those probe panels			0
two years ago , after @entity9 's disastrous outing at the @entity125 , president @entity126 , still fresh in office , fired the football federation board and placed a two - year ban on @entity9 's participation in international football competitions			2
the purpose of that ban , according to a presidential spokesperson , was to " enable us put our house in order and enable us work out a more meaningful way to engage the global stage in terms of football so that this kind of rather embarrassing outcome we had in @entity143 will not repeat itself			2
" two years on , our embarrassments have grown muscle and wings			0
like @entity147 recycling his wins with a certainty bordering on the surreal , we have made a spectacle of recycling our sporting failures			1
different arenas , same scenarios			0
i should n't be too negative			0
it 's perhaps not a totally hopeless situation			0
in a recent interview a chastened minister @entity37 was quoted as saying : " if we want to win and compete sustainably , we have to develop systems that establish clear connection between process and outcome			1
" sadly systems are something @entity9 is not very good at or keen on building or sustaining			2
but for now we 'll have to trust that the reform - minded minister has it all planned out			2
" @entity168 can have a galvanising effect			0
and , i believe it is easier to deal with failure than to deal with success			0
this failure is an opportunity to do the right thing , " he went on to say			0
i bet he knows only too well that failure also presents an opportunity to fail again , and fail worse			0
which is where the bulk of @entity9 's experience lies			2
watch : looking back at @entity35 @entity37 will have to do several things all at once -- fight mafias and cabals for whom self - enrichment is the pre-eminent sport , enlist private sector funding ( long stifled by corruption ) on a larger scale , rebuild a comatose school sports , raise the standard of the @entity195 , and offer his unconditional support to the @entity197 and @entity198 and others who , against many odds , and often in spite of the government , are striving to build the next generation of sporting talent			1
none of these will be easy			0
if the past is anything to go by , time is not on his side			0
and this is not only because the countdown to @entity214 has started			0
since democracy returned to @entity9 in 1999 , we 've had a total of 12 ministers for sport , translating to a new minister roughly every 12 months			1
going by that arithmetic , @entity37 and his lofty dreams already have their expiry date bearing down on them with the speed of @entity147 , and the deadly accuracy of @entity228			2
he will therefore be needing large doses of good fortune ; the sort that every now and then transforms an underdog into an @entity48 champion .			0

closure of @entity1 symbolic of administration failures , writes @entity237
the opening ceremony was *highlight* for medal-less @entity9
" we have made a spectacle of recycling our sporting failures , " the @entity32 *journalist* said
@entity9 sports minister @entity37 will have work cut out for him
