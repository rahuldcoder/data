-- as @entity3 's fifth prime minister in four years , @entity1 hopes the revolving door of @entity3 politics will remain closed long enough for him to reinvigorate the country			1
" the @entity3 economy has remained stagnant and suicides have remained 30,000 or so per annum for many years now			2
so , @entity3 as a country has lost its vigor , it feels very much closed in for various reasons , " he told @entity0 in his first interview with a @entity11 broadcaster			2
@entity1 indicated five areas that he and his government have been addressing to help open up the country since he succeeded former prime minister @entity18 in june			1
" the first is that we need to grow the economy , the second is to strive for fiscal consolidation and the third is to reform our social security system , and the fourth is to achieve what i call regional sovereignty to change the shape of this country and the fifth is for the @entity3 people to actively , with ownership , engage in diplomacy			2
" ten years down the road i believe that @entity3 will emerge stronger and more vigorous economically , socially and otherwise			2
" considered a man of the people , @entity1 came to prominence in the 1990s when he exposed a government cover - up of hiv - infected blood distributed to hemophiliacs			0
he stepped down as leader of the @entity42 six years ago after being embroiled in a pensions scandal , but his political revival was complete this summer when he succeeded @entity18 as prime minister			1
since he arrived in office , @entity1 has had to deal with a number of issues , among them the recent clash with @entity51 over the territorial claims of islands in the @entity54			0
" i believe in any country , matters that relate to its territory would , of course , provoke strong sentiments amongst the people of that country			0
but i trust that five years , ten years down the road , when people look back at how we dealt with that , people then will appreciate that my cabinet dealt with the issue in a calm manner , " he said			0
" [ a ] s far as @entity3 is concerned , there is no territorial issue connected to the @entity73			1
in fact , the @entity73 are ... inherent territory of @entity3 that is recognized in our history and also by international law			1
" the islands are known as the @entity73 in @entity51			0
" @entity51 has become a major presence for most countries around the world but notably for its neighboring countries in @entity84			0
so i think it is a common position for @entity3 and its @entity84 neighbors that we certainly would strive to maintain as much as possible friendly relations with @entity51			0
but at the same time seek @entity51 to behave in accordance with international rules			0
" @entity1 's predecessor resigned after failing to hold an election pledge to move an unpopular @entity94 military base away from its current location on the island of @entity98			1
while @entity1 told @entity0 that plans have been agreed to move the based , he reiterated the strength of the @entity3 - @entity94 relationship			1
" i believe the @entity3 - @entity94 relationship is in very good shape today			2
i have met president @entity103 twice and in both of these meetings we have agreed that we should further deepen and advance the @entity3 - @entity94 alliance and more specifically we have agreed that we should further deepen our relations on three pillars , that is security , our economy , and cultural , and people - to - people exchanges , " he said			1
a strong yen , cause for concern for many @entity3 companies and workers , was in part blamed by @entity1 on the state of the @entity94 economy			1
" i believe one of the basic causes for that situation is the fact that the @entity94 economy , whilst undergoing some changes , if anything , is being steered toward a weaker dollar , " he said			1
" if you want to change this strong yen situation we need to do three things			2
first of all , we need to invest more overseas ... the second thing we need to do is to increase domestic demand ... [ and ] as agreed at the @entity135 summit , should there be excessive fluctuations in exchange markets , then we need to take resolute actions			0
" one of the most questioning voices of @entity1 so far has been his wife , who wrote a book entitled , " what on @entity143 that you are prime minister ? " the couple have a playfully adversarial relationship -- when they fight " she always wins , " @entity1 said			1
" what she tells me all the time is that she is a primary voter , meaning that when i talk to our voters about my ideas , she says if she does not get convinced with what i say , no voters would buy my argument			0
she tells me to try to convince her first with my argument			0
for me , she is the most challenging voter			0
