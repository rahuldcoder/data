-- you can be forgiven for losing track of time the morning after a night 77 years in the making			1
" oh sorry , that 's my alarm , " says an apologetic @entity4 as his alarm trills while being interviewed			1
" that was the finals day time for getting up , 915am ... just for yesterday			0
" yesterday was sunday july 7 and the day which saw @entity4 secure his place in @entity12 sporting history			1
in the 24 hours between those two alarms going off , @entity4 's world irrevocably changed with his 6 - 4 7 - 5 6 - 4 win over over @entity15 in straight sets ensuring he became @entity12 's first men 's singles champion at @entity18 since 1936			1
it had been the most energy - sapping three sets of his career , with the world no. 2 eventually beating the world no. 1 following three hours of brutal battle , but @entity4 did n't want to go to sleep			1
after waiting his entire career to win the title @entity12 had so wanted for nearly eight decades , the @entity27 was scared of waking up to discover it was all a dream			1
" that 's the one worry you have when you go to bed , " @entity4 told @entity0 after becoming the first male @entity12 singles champion at @entity18 since @entity32			1
" you wake up and it 's actually not true , so i was obviously very happy and relieved that i had done it			0
" blog : @entity4 grasps opportunity to make history twelve months ago @entity4 had sobbed on @entity41 after losing his first @entity18 final to @entity43			1
redemption came a month later on the same court against the same opponent , only with a different outcome			0
the @entity27 won to clinch @entity49 gold at @entity50 and the hearts of a jubilant @entity12 public began to soften towards a man that had arguably come up short in the popularity stakes when compared to another @entity12 tennis star -- the now retired -- @entity57			1
in september a first grand slam title promptly followed at the @entity59 , as @entity4 beat @entity15 in five sets in @entity61			1
" last year was the toughest loss of my career , " explained the 26 - year - old @entity4 when asked about his defeat in last year 's @entity18 final			1
" it was the first time i responded well from a grand slam defeat and the @entity49 helped			0
" that period after the @entity18 final and the @entity49 was probably the most important of my career because it could have gone the other way			1
i could have not recovered from it and it could have been a struggle but i worked hard			0
" i said after the semifinal that @entity18 is the pinnacle of the sport , " added @entity4 , referring to his comments after his last four win over @entity76			1
" to do it with all of the pressure and stuff was really tough , it took a lot out of me			0
i 'm just glad i do n't have to worry about it anymore			0
" weight of expectation @entity4 might have been worrying , but so to has the @entity12 public			1
worrying about a @entity89 winning @entity18 has been a national pastime			2
he is the country 's sole male tennis star and his annual quest for grass - court glory grips millions of anxious fans			2
while the shouts of encouragement inside @entity41 can work in @entity4 's favor , the media interest and the weight of expectation can also be a monkey on his back			1
" during the match you try to embrace the pressures , the emotions and the struggle you 're going through out there , " said @entity4			2
" you have to embrace the occasion , but it 's not necessarily enjoyment			0
you enjoy the winning and the outcome			0
if you lose , you 're incredibly disappointed			0
" it looked as if the pressure might just be too much for @entity4 in what proved to be the deciding game of an absorbing final			2
@entity4 , calm and composed , was 40 - 0 up with three championship points			2
ever the competitor , @entity15 showed the spirit and skill which has led him to six grand slam titles by hitting back			2
a nation held its breath			0
" in that moment it must have been hard for people to watch , " admitted @entity4 , who saved three break points before @entity15 found the net and the celebrations kicked off			1
" last night i just saw the last game , it was tough to watch even though i knew the outcome , " said the @entity27			0
after such a momentous triumph , it is tempting to suggest @entity4 can rest on his laurels			2
but the man from @entity136 has more grand slams in his sights , starting with a return to the @entity140 at the end of august			0
" for me it 's been to gradual improve throughout my career , " he answers			2
" year upon year just getting a little bit better and change a few things			0
" i will have a rest now and get myself ready to defend the @entity59			0
it will be my first time trying to defend a grand slam title so it will be a new pressure for me , a new experience and i look forward to it			0
" he better keep that alarm on .			0
