-- people with diabetes are at increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke at an early age , but that 's not the only worry			1
diabetes appears to dramatically increase a person 's risk of developing alzheimer 's disease or other types of dementia later in life , according to a new study conducted in @entity17			1
in the study , which included more than 1,000 men and women over age 60 , researchers found that people with diabetes were twice as likely as the other study participants to develop alzheimer 's disease within 15 years			1
they were also 1.75 times more likely to develop dementia of any kind			2
" it 's really important for the [ public 's ] health to understand that diabetes is a significant risk factor for all of these types of dementia , " says @entity28 , @entity29 , an epidemiologist in the research division of @entity31 , a nonprofit health - care organization based in @entity33 , @entity31			2
@entity0 : signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes @entity28 , who studies risk factors for @entity45 's but was n't involved in the new research , stresses that many questions remain about the link between diabetes and dementia			1
the new study was " well done " and provides " really good evidence that people with diabetes are at greater risk , " she says , " but we really need to look at other studies to find out why			2
" diabetes could contribute to dementia in several ways , which researchers are still sorting out			1
insulin resistance , which causes high blood sugar and in some cases leads to type 2 diabetes , may interfere with the body 's ability to break down a protein ( amyloid ) that forms brain plaques that have been linked to @entity45 's			1
high blood sugar ( glucose ) also produces certain oxygen - containing molecules that can damage cells , in a process known as oxidative stress			0
in addition , high blood sugar -- along with high cholesterol -- plays a role in the hardening and narrowing of arteries in the brain			0
this condition , known as atherosclerosis , can bring about vascular dementia , which occurs when artery blockages ( including strokes ) kill brain tissue			0
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity45 's disease " having high glucose is a stressor to the nervous system and to the blood vessels , " says @entity93 , @entity94 , a professor of neurology at the @entity96 at @entity97			1
" the emerging information on alzheimer 's disease and glucose shows us that we do need to remain vigilant on blood sugar levels as we get older			1
" studies dating back to the late 1990s have suggested that people with diabetes are more likely to develop alzheimer 's disease and other types of dementia , but the research has been marred by inconsistent definitions of both diabetes and dementia			1
the authors of the new study , led by @entity118 , @entity94 , an environmental medicine researcher at @entity120 , in @entity121 , sought to address this weakness by using the gold standard of diabetes diagnosis , an oral glucose tolerance test			0
this involves giving a person a sugar - loaded drink after they have fasted for at least 12 hours , and then measuring how much glucose remains in their blood two hours later			0
@entity0 : exercise tips for people with type 2 diabetes at the beginning of the study , the tests showed that 15 % of the participants had full - fledged diabetes , while 23 % had prediabetes , also known as impaired glucose tolerance			2
the participants were all dementia - free when the tests were done , but over the next 15 years 23 % received a diagnosis of dementia			0
slightly less than half of those cases were deemed to be alzheimer 's disease , with the remainder roughly split between vascular dementia and dementia due to other causes			1
( the diagnoses were confirmed with brain scans of living patients and brain autopsies in deceased patients			0
) both diabetes and prediabetes were associated with an increased risk of dementia diagnosis , although the association was weaker for prediabetes			0
and the link persisted even after the researchers took into account several factors associated with both diabetes and dementia risk , such as age , sex , blood pressure , and body mass index			2
@entity0 : natural ways to lower blood pressure the results were published today in the journal @entity178			0
the next step , @entity28 says , will be to understand whether controlling blood sugar and reducing risk factors for type 2 diabetes also reduces dementia risk			0
she and her colleagues have several studies underway investigating these questions			0
