@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 on wednesday rejected a report from lawmakers saying the country had hosted secret @entity8 prisons as part of the " war on terror			1
" " there are neither facts nor information that secret @entity8 detention centers existed in @entity3 , " the ministry said in a statement , contradicting @entity14 statements a day earlier based on a report by @entity3 lawmakers			1
" it has neither concluded that the territory of @entity3 was used to transfer persons under suspicion of terrorism nor that such persons had been brought in or transported from the territory of @entity3 , " the @entity2 said of the parliamentary report			1
@entity14 said a day earlier that the former @entity29 republic , now a @entity31 member , had become the first country to admit it hosted secret @entity8 detention centers for terror suspects			1
the tiny country on the @entity38 contained two " black sites , " the group said -- the first holding a single prisoner in 2002			1
in 2004 , a former riding school outside the capital , @entity43 , was converted to hold up to eight detainees , according to the @entity3 parliamentary report , @entity14 said			1
the @entity47 administration came under fierce criticism for the alleged practice of " extraordinary rendition " -- capturing suspected terrorists in one country , moving them to another country without proper legal protections , and using " enhanced interrogation techniques " on them			1
opponents of the practice say the interrogations amounted to torture			0
former @entity8 agent @entity60 explained tuesday how it worked			2
" there were flights coming in from the battlefields and @entity65 or @entity66			0
there were flights that were coming in from other nation - states which were not at war but we were collaborating with -- for example , @entity74 or @entity75 -- where suspected terrorists were picked up and brought to the interrogation centers where they were interrogated , " he said			0
" and then the information gained from those interrogations was then shared among the participating nations			0
" the @entity82 administration says it no longer operates black sites , but has not formally ended the process of extraordinary rendition			1
a @entity8 spokesman declined to confirm or deny the @entity3 lawmakers ' report			1
" the agency 's terrorist detention program is over , and the @entity8 has not commented publicly on where facilities associated with that effort may or may not have been , " said @entity89 of the @entity8 @entity90			1
he added that the allegation that @entity3 hosted black sites was " not new			1
" @entity14 said it was not important whether the allegation was new or not			0
" confirmation of the existence of a secret prison in @entity3 marks a modern low point for human rights protection in @entity101 , " said @entity99 , @entity14 's expert on counterterrorism in @entity101			2
" but the @entity3 inquiry signals a turning point in the quest for the truth about what role @entity101 states played in helping the @entity114 in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			0
other @entity101 governments should take note and commit to full investigations of similar serious allegations			0
" other @entity101 states , like @entity122 and @entity123 , have also been accused by human rights groups -- and even the @entity125 and the @entity126 -- of housing secret @entity8 prisons and colluding in extraordinary renditions			2
@entity3 's parliamentary report may put more pressure on other states to come clean			2
but there are lingering doubts about aspects of the report by the @entity3 parliamentary @entity137			2
it accuses the @entity3 security services of providing the @entity8 with the facilities without the knowledge of the country 's political leadership			1
analysts say that seems unlikely			0
" to think that any national government would have foreign aircraft flying into its airspace , people being taken from aircraft and moved to control facilities somewhere within their sovereign territories -- and neither the central government , police , customs or air traffic control , no one knew anything about this except for the head of the security service ... that 's just not believable , " said @entity60 , the former @entity8 officer			0
it would be a violation of @entity3 law if true , @entity14 pointed out			2
" the @entity3 government should have known what its own agencies were doing and is ultimately responsible for the secret prison and any human rights violations that may have taken place there , " the advocacy group said			0
" the inquiry 's findings are only a first step toward accountability , " said @entity99			0
" the investigation in @entity3 should continue and those persons responsible for any involvement in the secret site must be identified and prosecuted			0
" @entity1 's @entity182 in @entity183 , @entity184 , and @entity185 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
