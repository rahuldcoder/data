-- after ceding the smartphone and tablet size war to competitors like @entity5 for the past few years , it appears @entity6 had finally decided that bigger is better			0
the next @entity7 will be @entity6 's biggest ever , with a whopping 12.9 - inch display screen , according to a report tuesday from @entity10			1
that would be a huge leap from the current 9.7 - inch @entity14 screen			1
and the report comes as @entity6 prepares to release not one , but two , new , bigger iphones			1
multiple reports have said the company plans to announce iphones with displays of 4.7 and 5.5 inches			2
that 's compared to the 4 - inch display on the @entity22 , and would put them more in line with their chief rival , @entity5 , which has put a dent in the @entity22 's dominance with devices in their @entity31 and @entity32 note lines			1
so , what 's with the super-sizing out of @entity35 ? @entity36 , an analyst with @entity37 , says bigger smartphones are a natural response to the way people have begun to use them			2
" as our digital lives become deeper , we 're spending a lot less time speaking on phones and more time using smartphones as tools -- for communications , yes , but for paying our bills , finding the nearest atm , looking up sports scores , taking photos , navigating around town , and other activities , " he said			0
" with more digital activity and less minutes spent on voice calls , it 's only natural that phones should grow larger			2
" in recent years , @entity6 has watched as competitors managed to chip away at its smartphone dominance by offering an array of products at different prices and sizes while @entity6 stuck with a single flagship phone			0
last year 's @entity22 and @entity66 marked the first time @entity6 offered more than one new version of its phone			0
both have 4 - inch screens			1
meanwhile , @entity5 's flagship @entity72 has a 5.1 - inch display and the company 's @entity75 has a whopping 5.7 - inch screen			1
as phones grow , @entity36 said , it only makes sense for tablets to do the same			2
" seven - or 8 - inch tablets are popular today , but if i have a 5 - or 6 - inch phone , i would n't want one , " he said			1
" instead , larger screen sizes wedded with ever thinner , ever lighter materials means that i could have a 12.9 - inch tablet that weighs no more than a 10 - inch tablet used to weigh -- making it quite portable			1
" in addition to differentiating itself from the growing field of hybrid " phablets , " a bigger @entity7 screen could be a step toward the goal of making tablets more than just consumption and recreational devices			1
analysts say they can see design , manufacturing , education as just a few areas in which a bigger display would be useful			0
but is bigger really better ? some in the mobile world have argued against that			0
" you can hold it in one hand , " @entity6 marketing vice president @entity106 said when introducing the 7.9 - inch @entity107 in 2012			1
founder @entity110 was adamant until the end that a 3.5 - inch screen was the perfect size for a smartphone screen			2
" you ca n't get your hand around it , " @entity110 said in 2010 , as rivals running @entity118 's @entity117 operating system began rolling out bigger phones			2
" no one 's going to buy that			0
" according to a 2013 study by mobile designer and author @entity128 , 59 % of smartphone users operate their device with one hand , perhaps lending some credence to @entity110 ' argument			0
" as with the @entity107 -- which @entity110 said was a bad idea before he passed away -- a larger @entity7 would be a departure for @entity6 , " @entity36 said			0
" but it 's a welcomed one : market segmentation is important , and there are buyers who would benefit from a larger device			0
" @entity140 will continue to put his own imprint on @entity6 , and we 'll see if the bets he makes succeed			0

a report says the next @entity7 will have a 12.9 - inch display
that 's up from 9.7 inches , and follows news of bigger iphones
analyst says bigger screens go along with how we use phones
if phones become " phablets , " tablets need to get bigger , too
