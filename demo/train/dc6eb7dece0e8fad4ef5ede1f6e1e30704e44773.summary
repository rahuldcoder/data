editor 's note : @entity4 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose new book is " @entity6 : a @entity7			1
" seven - year - old @entity8 wanted to be a @entity9 and a doctor			1
( @entity4 ) -- on the morning of last year 's annual @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , a family , appearing a little lost , walked up and down a crowded street , looking in vain for the table to sign up their entry			1
they carried a large sunflower with them			1
if no one noticed the exhausted , grieving look in the family 's eyes , that was understandable			1
the @entity11 is a place of happy noise : rides and music and food booths			1
it is @entity12 's fall festival , and people from across northwest @entity13 come to spend a saturday in the midst of the milling , chattering crowds			1
the family silently bearing the large sunflower had never been to the fair before			1
they finally located the entry table , and asked for a form			2
they carefully filled it out			2
their flower was entered in the seed head category -- the one that judges the largest seed head , which is the circular area in the middle of a sunflower			1
they wrote down the name of the person who had grown the sunflower : @entity8			1
he was their 7 - year - old son			2
he had died earlier that same day , at a few minutes after midnight			1
now , less than 10 hours later , here they were , with @entity8 's flower			1
" he loved growing his sunflowers , " said his mother , @entity60			2
" every year we talked about coming into @entity12 for the @entity11 , but we never got around to it			2
@entity8 really wanted to be part of the contest			1
" that 's what they had planned -- a day at the fair , to enter his sunflower			1
he was a healthy , constantly laughing boy -- he loved school , where he was in the second grade , he loved horses , he loved his big brother @entity76 , with whom he shared a bedroom			1
the @entity78 lived in the tiny town of @entity80 , about 15 minutes from @entity12 ; @entity8 would look out the back window , watching for blue jays and cardinals			2
" he planted his sunflowers in our garden , " @entity60 said			1
" he was so careful with them			2
a few weeks before the fair , there was a heavy windstorm that knocked his biggest sunflower over			1
he called to me : ' @entity93 , it 's on the ground -- my flower , it 's down			1
' he was afraid it was ruined			2
but he managed to save it			2
" the week before the fair , @entity8 was n't feeling well in class -- he had a sore throat			2
the school called on a wednesday			2
" but the next morning , he was up , and he wanted to go to school , " his mother said			2
" he was always so responsible -- he said , ' i did n't get my homework done last night			2
' i told him that was all right , that the school would understand			2
but as i made him his toast , he sat there on the couch , doing his homework			0
" she told him he really should n't go to school			0
that day , he seemed to get sicker and sicker			0
" we drove over to the hospital in @entity121 that night , " his mother said			0
" he was talking in the car			0
as sick as he was , he said to us : ' @entity93 , when are we going to get to go camping ? ' there was this big , round , moon in the sky , and he looked out the window of the car and told us to look at it			0
he said the moon was so beautiful			0
" at the hospital , they knew he was in very bad shape			0
@entity8 , it would turn out , had contracted an overwhelming bacterial infection that had entered his bloodstream and that was attacking his organs			1
he was in the hospital that thursday night and all day and all evening friday			0
his body went into septic shock ; it could n't fight off the infection			0
his life ended just as the new day began			0
" he had always told us he wanted to grow up to be a @entity9 , " his mother said			1
" then he said he wanted to be a doctor			0
so we told him he could be a @entity9 doctor			0
" and now they were at the hospital , and at age 7 , he was gone			0
someone remembered : this was going to be the day of the @entity11			0
how they found the strength to do it is hard to conceive			0
but that morning , carrying @entity8 's favorite sunflower -- the one he had saved when the wind had knocked it down -- they were at the fair in @entity12			1
they waited together as all the categories were judged			0
no one around them had any idea			0
and then , through the loudspeaker system at the fair , the winner of his category was announced : " first place			0
" the judging committee looked around , waiting for the winner to come forward and accept his trophy			0
. well , you can imagine			0
" i do n't even remember which one of us went up to accept it for him , " his mother said			0
" but @entity8 had won			0
" that was a year ago			0
a few months later , the fair 's organizer , @entity177 , approached @entity60 and asked her if she would like to serve on the committee			0
and this year at the fair , the contest -- all the categories , the whole competition -- had a new name : the @entity185			1
the seeds from @entity8 's winning flower were given to his classmates at @entity189			1
the children planted them in the school 's new memorial garden , the one that is named for @entity8			1
the sunflowers are blooming now			0
soon enough winter will arrive , and the snow will cover @entity13			1
but the seeds will be planted in the school 's garden every year , and forever the flowers will return , bright and vibrant and full of life 's very best promise , like the smile of a boy who believes he can do anything			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

a boy in @entity13 saved his *prized* sunflower after a windstorm
the family entered the flower in a contest after the boy died
seeds of that sunflower will grow in his memorial garden
