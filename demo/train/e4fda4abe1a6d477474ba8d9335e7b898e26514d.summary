@entity0 -- on the steps of @entity4 , tourists gaze out over a tent city within the @entity6 , an impromptu encampment in the shadow of one of @entity0 's most enduring landmarks			1
below , the colorful canvas of more than 150 temporary shelters fills the gray sidewalk , and bright posters and banners festoon the statue of @entity17			2
hundreds of protesters began camping out near the cathedral on saturday , after their attempts to occupy the @entity21 failed			1
like many others which have demonstrated across the world in recent days , the group was inspired by the actions of the @entity28 movement in the @entity29 , which took to the streets of @entity31 more than a month ago			1
the @entity0 collective was given a boost on sunday when @entity34 , @entity35 chancellor of @entity4 , welcomed the protesters to the church grounds , after police blocked them from entering neighboring @entity38			1
the police are still here -- their vans line up alongside @entity0 's famous red double - decker buses in a nearby street			1
the officers inside are poised for action , but the peaceful nature of the protests so far means they have little to do but watch			2
finance workers in sharp suits wander past the protests , staring -- some bemused , others amused -- at the makeshift campsite which has sprung up in recent days			0
others ignore the flyers , placards and protesters as they hurry along , apparently assuming the fuss is nothing but a flash in the pan -- something those camped out are keen to disprove			1
" we 're staying forever , " insists @entity62			0
" we 're staying until the rector says we have to go , and he says we can stay , so we 're staying until our demands are met			1
" asked what those demands are , @entity62 reels off a list which veers from the idealistic to the jokey , which his friend , artist and fellow protester @entity69 , says " sounds like a @entity73 wish list " -- and which suggests the campers may be here until well into the new year			1
" we 're a solidarity movement			2
we want to replace the @entity78 with the @entity79 - seven - billion , we want a global democracy : government by the people , for the people , not by governments acting for the big banks , " he says			0
@entity87 : occupy @entity28 protests go global historian @entity89 , who has been part of the protests since saturday , and camped out at the site overnight , told @entity1 he was taking action to call for a new financial system			1
" it 's not that the system is broken -- it 's going on exactly as it is supposed to : people buy , buy , buy , until they have homes full of stuff and no money , so they stop buying , sales go down , companies get into trouble and the economy crashes -- it happened in the 1990s , in the 1980s , in the 1970s			2
it 's happening now , and it 's going to get worse			0
" the system needs to change			2
we need to focus not on big profits , not on the headline figures , but on what they mean to people 's lives			0
" i work in schools , and the kids are terrified -- they really do n't like the generation above , they think ' you 've screwed us			0
' they are left with no opportunities , but they are the ones who are having to pick up the costs			0
" it is manifestly unfair , but the mood seems to be changing			0
this morning we greeted the people coming to work at the @entity21 , and there were lots of people saying " we 're with you			0
" " " we are part of a global movement of people who are fed up with the current system , " says session musician and builder @entity129 , who traveled from his home in @entity132 to take part in the protests			1
" we have a sickening feeling in our stomach at the way things are , and at the way humans are enslaved			0
" @entity145 plans to stay at the camp for at least a week , and says he has been pleasantly surprised by the reactions of passers - by to the camp			2
" there is a real atmosphere of fun and of camaraderie not just between us , but between us and the public			0
there 's been hardly any hostility , people have been donating food -- one guy told me " i just wish i had the balls to do this			0
" " @entity165 tourist @entity164 , who stopped by the tent village after visiting @entity4 with her family , said she was impressed by the protests			1
" i know @entity169 has been badly hit by the economic crisis , and people here have lost their jobs , so i think it 's great that people have come out onto the streets			0
" it is becoming a global thing , thanks to the internet and @entity180 and @entity181 -- and it is in @entity29 too , though they are n't so famous for demonstrating -- we 're normally better at it in @entity165			1
" not everyone is so positive			0
" they 've obviously got a lot of time on their hands , " says one city worker , dismissively			2
" i do n't think a lot of it , but at least they 're peaceful			0
" " i 'm just amused by it really , " says another , who has been watching the protesters discussions			2
" they 've got nothing better to do , i suppose			0
" but 71 - year - old retiree @entity198 told @entity1 that taking part in the protests was a question of ethics , saying that protesters across the globe were calling world governments to account			1
" the @entity29 started this , and now it 's gone global , to more than 80 countries			1
@entity208 bless @entity29 for that ! but get your act together , for goodness sake , or else the people will make you			1
