-- at @entity3 's home in the @entity5 capital , the television is more often switched to " @entity6 " and " @entity7 " than the news			1
not that the 22 - year - old college student wants anyone to think her superficial , but it 's her way of coping with the ominous -- the heated rhetoric of war with @entity14 and the @entity15			1
" my friends and i do n't talk about politics or the thought of a war , " she says , laughing			1
" i stopped watching the news all together			1
" @entity3 is not unlike millions of @entity5 who , like their neighboring @entity22 did in early 2003 , fear war is looming			1
@entity14 would face challenge in bombing @entity5 nuclear sites , experts say some are less worried than others -- a @entity31 fast food worker says @entity14 has been threatening @entity5 for years and this time is more of the same bluster			1
still , all the bellicose talk from national leaders and punishing international sanctions trickling down to average @entity5 who are paying higher prices for food and basic commodities , has cast an uneasy pall over life 's routine			1
@entity14 has threatened to bomb @entity5 to end or at least set back @entity5 's nuclear ambitions			1
@entity5 insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy purposes and has said it will not hesitate to strike back at its enemies			1
@entity15 president @entity47 has stated @entity5 developing nuclear weapons is not acceptable and that @entity50 " will always have @entity14 's back			1
" that sort of talk is unsettling to @entity3 , who like others in this story did not want their full names used for fear of repercussion			1
she tries to go about life focusing on her education and hanging out with friends in tony @entity31 coffee shops			1
she buys @entity62 at the local bazaar and swoons over @entity64			1
in many ways she is not unlike her @entity15 counterparts except that @entity3 lives in the @entity67 and her government is considered an enemy of @entity50			1
she thinks longingly about moving to @entity15 one day			1
in her country , she feels , she will never be able to freely express herself or her passion for art , music , films			1
she can not fathom why the @entity15 would consider an attack @entity5			1
opinion : @entity14 's ' @entity78 ' system is n't enough protection " i understand why @entity15 does n't like our government			1
they do n't agree that they should impose @entity86 on our society but that should not give them a reason for war , " she says			1
her parents worry that the bombing of @entity5 would create another situation like @entity22 in 2003			2
they are especially concerned because @entity3 's brother is 17 and because of @entity5 's mandatory conscription , he will have to serve in the military after high school			1
" if there were a war , no doubt my brother would be in danger , " she says			1
the family has applied for visas through @entity3 's aunt in @entity106			1
@entity3 prays every night that they will be granted			1
" i have faith in ( @entity47 ) @entity47 's policies , " she says			2
" i think he is a smart man who in the end will make the right decision to not start a war with @entity5			1
" nevertheless , a sense of panic is on the rise in cities and towns across @entity5 over the prospect of guns and no butter			2
tighter sanctions drove down the @entity5 currency , the rial , and @entity5 gobbled up gold , @entity15 dollars and even real estate in order to protect their savings			2
food prices have soared , too , prompting some to stockpile basic items in case an even darker day looms over the horizon			2
this week the strangling of @entity5 's finances got tighter			2
@entity135 , the world 's largest electronic banking system , agreed to cut off @entity5 banks and individuals on the @entity141 's sanctions list			2
starting at noon saturday , @entity5 will be severed from the main vehicle for monetary transactions			2
@entity5 's business partners , including vital crude oil customers who account for half of the government 's revenues , will have to find an alternative way to pay			2
beyond staggering inflation and a plunging national currency , analysts fear @entity5 now could face shortages of essential goods like food and medicine			2
retired elementary school teacher @entity158 , 67 , lives in the city of @entity160 , just south of @entity161 , an uranium enrichment facility for power plants or potentially for bombs			2
in her modest two - bedroom apartment , she cares for her two grandchildren because her daughter was forced to go back to work to make ends meet			2
she takes the children for walks in a nearby park and wonders what would happen if @entity14 conducted military strikes against @entity5 's nuclear plants and military installations			2
" @entity5 are educated , fun - loving people , " she says			2
" we are against war and against aggression			1
" she wishes @entity15 knew more about the rich history of her country -- art , music , poetry -- and about the turmoil @entity5 have survived			2
" i honestly think they look at us as terrorists , like the ones that are portrayed in the movies , ' she says			2
" they think we wear burkas like they do in @entity194 , and do n't allow women to drive like in @entity196			0
@entity5 is different , we are different			0
we want peace like anyone else in this world			0
" @entity158 's anxiety is heightened on sundays when she heads to the fruit and vegetable market			1
last week , the price of tomatoes went up so much that she could not justify buying them			0
the butcher told her he had n't seen profit in two months -- who can afford to buy meat anymore ? she tried to buy @entity15 dollars recently but the bank informed her of limits on how much she could exchange			0
" i always like to save some dollars in my house , just in case , " she says			0
@entity215 , the @entity216 new year , is coming up march 20 , but @entity158 says this year , the traditional meals and large get togethers will be a lot simpler			1
" i 'm worried that our beautiful country will become similar to what the @entity15 did to @entity22 , " she says			0
" i pray to @entity223 they do n't			0
i love @entity15 and love @entity15			0
but i do n't understand the need to meddle in our country 's issues			0
" she says she is willing to live with @entity5 's problems , if only she could have a guarantee of no war			1
" that would be the end to our livelihoods and the little freedom we have now , " she says			0
back in @entity31 , @entity238 , 39 , says he is more concerned about facing economic hardship than dodging missiles and rockets			1
" it 's all bluffing and political nonsense , " says the university @entity243 instructor about threats from @entity14 and the @entity246			0
" this happens every few years between @entity5 , @entity14 and the @entity249 is normal , " he says			0
" in a month it will quiet down again and in two years it will flare up again			0
this is the political wheel , always spinning			0
@entity47 has said he does n't want a war with @entity5 , and we all know @entity14 can not proceed with a war alone			1
" @entity238 sees money as his number one problem			0
he resents having to rely on his parents for support but he , his wife and child are forced to stay in an extra apartment at his parents ' home			0
even though he has a degree and good job , his salary is no match for the prices at the market			0
" my advice to my country is to open our doors to the world , " he says			0
" let 's show them that we have a right to nuclear technology , and that we are not making nuclear weapons			0
the @entity281 nations always want to have their hands in other countries			0
i 'm pretty sure unemployment and crime is high in @entity15			0
should n't they be focusing on that ? " the tension within @entity5 is affecting people outside its borders , too			0
@entity291 , 36 , and @entity292 , 34 , fled @entity5 with their mother after the 1979 revolution and have not been back since			0
they have not seen their grandparents since they were babies			0
@entity291 says her grandmother weeps on the phone every week when they speak over the continents and oceans			0
to see her granddaughters again would help her die a " blessed old woman			0
" the sisters , who live in @entity306 , planned to return to their homeland for the very first time for the @entity216 new year			1
they booked their tickets and arranged their trip to @entity311 , the city where her family used to live			0
