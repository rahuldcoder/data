@entity0 -- a @entity3 program for collecting phone and @entity6 communications of suspected security targets outside the @entity8 has the potential to infringe on the privacy rights of @entity8 citizens , according to a report released wednesday by an independent government review board			1
the @entity3 's @entity15 program is still lawful , " valuable and effective " in protecting national security , according to the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , which noted that " no evidence of intentional abuse " was found in the program			1
however , " certain aspects of the program 's implementation raise privacy concerns , " according to the report			1
the large scope of that collection of @entity8 ' information that is supposed to be off - limits -- and uncertainty about the amount of information being gathered -- " push the program close to the line of constitutional reasonableness			0
" despite procedures to minimize collection of domestic and @entity8 ' communications at home and abroad , the government does n't know precisely how much data and content of @entity8 ' communications is being collected , the report says			0
the section 702 program is derived from a section of the @entity48 that was amended in 2008 and gave the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the authority to authorize " surveillance conducted within the @entity8 but targeting only non- @entity8 persons reasonably believed to be located outside the @entity8			0
" even though the 702 program is n't aimed at collecting domestic communications or those of @entity8 abroad , " incidental " collection of such data does occur , according to the report			2
the board expressed concern over the use of " about " collections -- those that lead to a person who may not be involved to a suspect communication -- " and the use of queries to search for the communications of specific @entity8 persons within the information that has been collected			2
" among the board 's conclusions was an affirmation that the " core " of the 702 program -- that is , narrowly defining those subjects targeted as non- @entity8 citizens living abroad and submitting to @entity48 court rules and oversight -- " fits within the ' totality of the circumstances ' standard for reasonableness under the @entity79 , as that standard has been defined by the courts to date			2
" the report lists 10 recommendations for strengthening privacy protections , such as revising the criteria for selecting targets for intelligence - gathering , limiting @entity94 use of @entity15 data , using more advanced " upstream " filtering technology to protect communications that are off - limits and requiring the government to supply random samples of targeting decisions to the @entity48 court when reapplying for certification of the section 702 program			1
the nation 's top intelligence official praised the report , but civil liberty advocates said the board failed to make effective proposals to protect privacy rights			1
director of national intelligence @entity111 said in a statement that the report " confirms that @entity15 has shown its value in preventing acts of terrorism at home and abroad , and pursuing other foreign intelligence goals			2
" " we take very seriously the board 's concerns regarding privacy and civil liberties , and we will review the board 's recommendations with care			1
" @entity128 of the @entity129 at the @entity130 said the board " has failed to fulfill its responsibility here , which is to ensure that counterterrorism policies safeguard privacy and civil liberties			1
" " the collection of @entity8 ' phone calls and e-mails without a warrant is unconstitutional , " @entity128 said , " regardless of whether they are communicating with their next - door neighbor or a suspected terrorist overseas			0
" " the @entity145 made a critical point that has often been overlooked in the @entity3 debate : that privacy is a human right protected under international law , " said @entity144 , also with the @entity129			2
she added that the issue " is much larger than simply the implementation of the directive and the board should take it on directly and expeditiously			0
" " we urge @entity154 to recognize the gaps and shortcomings in the @entity145 's recommendations , " @entity144 said , " and provide a more meaningful level of privacy protection for @entity8 and foreigners alike			0
" the independent panel began reviewing @entity3 surveillance at the requests of @entity154 and president @entity164 last year			0
the requests stemmed from media reports on two @entity3 programs that were based on the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents by former @entity3 contractor @entity170			0
the first report , released in january , centered on the program implemented under @entity174 of the @entity175 ( @entity17 ) , in which domestic telephone metadata ( i.e. , call records ) are collected in bulk			0
@entity179 summons @entity8 diplomat over report of @entity3 spying report : @entity3 collects millions of facial images per day telecom firm pushed back on @entity3 data collection , papers show @entity1 's @entity188 contributed to this report .			1
