-- i 'm starting to lose patience			2
it 's not like the guy does n't understand communication			2
actor @entity6 has 11 million @entity8 followers and nearly 13 million @entity10 fans			1
maybe he just forgot to put a stamp on the letter he should 've written to @entity13 , saying , " i 'm sorry i painted myself up in brown - face and spoke in a mock @entity16 accent in order to sell potato chips			1
i understand the serious impact this has on society , and i 'm trying to undo the damage i 've caused			2
" it 's been nearly two months since @entity6 's offensive commercial -- disguised as a dating video -- for popchips , a snack food company , appeared on @entity27 , showing him as " @entity29 , " a @entity31 producer			1
( in it , he also plays a hippie , a fashionista and a biker			2
) and while the ad has been removed , and popchips ceo @entity37 has issued a predictable " we did not intend to offend anyone " apology buried on the company 's blog , @entity6 has gotten away scot - free			1
as the @entity43 buzzed over the gaffe last month , @entity6 was posting links on how to " pull out a tooth with a rocket " and " 80s @entity48 by @entity49			1
" today , @entity6 's @entity8 and @entity10 accounts still link to the original popchips video , while the company 's website prominently features him as its " president of pop. " i work at a civil rights organization located two blocks from popchips ' @entity59 headquarters			1
walking to the office every morning on @entity62 , i am assaulted by @entity6 's 15 - foot tall ads for popchips			1
seeing his relaxed , smiling , " never baked but perfect if you are " face , i am reminded that the controversy has not scratched his reputation or earning power			0
many of you may be thinking , get over it ! it was just a joke ! why do you have to take this so seriously ? history can tell us why			2
in 1961 , actor @entity77 taped his eyes , wore buckteeth and spoke in a mock @entity81 accent in order to take on the role of a bumbling landlord , mr. @entity84 , in " breakfast at @entity86			0
" hilarious ? well , this was just 15 years after the closure of the last of the @entity93 internment camps , which incarcerated 120,000 innocent people of @entity81 descent , two - thirds of whom were @entity13 citizens			0
up until the 1960s , white entertainers were still painting their faces black and their lips bright red in order to play the roles of hapless houseboys or eager - to - please mammies			0
these minstrel shows amused generations of audiences with their grotesque exaggerations of stereotypes and reinforcement of crippling @entity112 laws , which upheld a separate and very unequal society in the @entity114 for nearly a century after the @entity115			1
@entity6 's brown - face ad comes at a time when @entity118 , along with @entity121 , @entity119 and @entity120 , have been subjected to more than a decade of post- 9/11 racial and religious bullying , profiling and hate crimes			1
need i go on ? unfortunately , there is no shortage of examples			0
but mr. @entity6 , do n't feel helpless , because here 's what you can do : 1			1
c'mon , you apologized ( and took a @entity8 leave of absence ! ) for lamenting the firing of @entity137 coach @entity136			1
for an example of a truly excellent i - take - responsibility - for - my - actions apology , look to actor @entity140 ( @entity141 on " @entity142 " ) , who apologized on june 3 for calling cricket a " gay " sport two days earlier			0
work with people who make you better			0
you are in the enviable position of being rich and famous , so you have more flexibility than others in choosing whose money you take			0
do some research on the companies you work with before accepting their paychecks			0
do they advocate the causes you claim to support ? 3			0
we may never know the total cost of the damage your popchips ad inflicted on society			1
but there are ways to curb it			0
invest your time and money into educating the public about @entity16 , @entity170 and other ethnic groups , and support solutions that promote the equality and dignity of all people			2
if you can do those three things , i promise you , it wo n't just be me smiling the next time i walk up @entity180 .			0
