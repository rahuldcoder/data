-- she 's been dubbed the @entity3 " @entity2 , " a former circuit - board - equipment seller who happened to sit next to one of the world 's richest business moguls on a plane -- and now heads his company			1
@entity11 , the chairperson of @entity14 commodities giant @entity13 , with a net worth estimated at an eye - watering $ 6 billion according to @entity17			1
orphaned at seven after her parents died in a train accident , @entity18 was raised by her grandfather in what was then the @entity24 , studying law at @entity26			1
she met her future husband , billionaire @entity28 , on a plane in 1988			1
when he died from leukemia two decades later , the mother of three was left in charge of one of the biggest commodity companies on the planet , as well as the @entity14 football club @entity36			1
you might not recognize the 160 - year - old @entity39 firm , but it 's the one trading 70 million tonnes of agricultural goods each year , employing 30,000 people			1
and since 1851 it 's been handed down from one male heir to another -- until now			1
@entity45 sat down with @entity0 's leading women to talk about the act of " fate " that sat her next to her future husband , how his illness taught her to manage " big egos , " and her plans for a company which claims to feed and clothe 500 million people worldwide			1
" my memories of growing up in @entity56 are very positive			2
i grew up without parents , but with my grandfather			1
but i did n't feel that i was really abandoned -- i had enough love from him			2
during the week i was in the boarding school and when i came home every weekend i had fun with my friends			2
i was not cold in winter -- i 'm telling you this because many people expected that i suffered from hunger			2
the @entity24 in the 1960s and 1970s was ok			1
of course i did n't have the luxury that children have today , but i had freedom			2
i had time to read which was very important generally for @entity3 children			2
it gave me a sense of the wide world and gave me a wish to see the world			0
" " i met @entity28 on the plane on the way from @entity81 to @entity82			0
we made a stop in @entity85 where he had just started his job as ceo of @entity88 and i was going on vacation to @entity90 from @entity82			0
we met shortly on the plane , a short conversation , and after this when i came back from vacation we met again			0
he was coming to @entity90 every weekend because his dog was here			0
the plane was empty and the computer put us together and i was wondering why ... but it was kind of fate			0
" " the moment i gave birth to the twins i learned @entity28 had leukemia			1
so nobody can live a normal life anymore			0
i had been a housewife up until the birth of the twins			0
then came this big sickness that changed our lives completely			1
and we could n't have a normal family vacation where everybody was happy and everybody was running around			0
the sickness was always there and we were traveling to different doctors but we had many hopes that he would still have many more years			0
" " the medical world is also a man 's world			2
in the three years of fighting for @entity28 's life i had to unite five big professors from around the world at one table			1
each of them had different ideas and different strategies and were used to their decision being followed			0
so for me , i felt the strength of the woman			2
because all of these men , they have big egos and i was kind of there to absorb these egos , give them the feeling of respecting their opinion -- even if you do n't take it			1
later when i came to the man 's world of commodities , also with big egos , i was used this experience			1
nobody knows everything so the main thing is to work together			0
" " @entity150 has a focus on giving back			0
it 's a new project for us , it 's now one - year - old and the whole idea was about education			1
for example in @entity160 , the youth orchestra includes @entity162 children together with @entity164 children who are learning through music how to love together			0
you know ' education ' is a magic word			0
and this magic word also becomes important in our foundation -- educating the farmers on how to produce sustainably and to feed themselves			0
