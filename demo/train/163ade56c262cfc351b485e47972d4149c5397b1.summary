-- the @entity1 is one of the most disruptive technologies of the past 5 years			2
along with the @entity5 , it birthed a new era of touch computing that does away with the mouse and keyboard altogether			0
and yet the @entity1 's undisputed dominance of the blossoming tablet market may not last forever			1
in fact , the @entity1 is about to get some stiff competition -- finally			1
to understand why the @entity1 dominates the tablet sector is not difficult : not only was it the first of the new wave of touchscreen tablets , but it 's also the most desirable in the eyes of consumers			1
the @entity5 had a few chinks in its armor early on : it was only available on one network in the @entity24 , leaving room for competitors to thrive on other networks			0
this @entity28 is n't such a problem for the @entity1 : not only is it available on both @entity31 and @entity32 , but many consumers simply buy the @entity35 version , meaning the carrier issue is n't as relevant			0
competitors were also able to best the @entity5 , which initially cost at least $ 499 , on price : cheaper alternatives using @entity40 became abundant , especially when carrier subsidies were taken into consideration			0
and yet rivals to the @entity1 cost about the same and lack the @entity44 © of the original			0
if you want something like the @entity1 , your best choice has been ... the @entity1			0
things are about to change , however			0
two affordable and promising tablet contenders are going on sale next week			0
on tuesday , @entity51 releases its @entity52			0
for only $ 199 -- versus $ 499 for the @entity1 -- you get a full - color , 7 - inch touchscreen tablet			1
you also get access to a millions of movies , tv shows , songs , books and magazines			1
not to mention that @entity51 has its own version of @entity40 's app store , and the @entity52 comes with a new web browser that claims to be faster than the competition			1
then on wednesday comes @entity67 's @entity66 , which has similar specs as the @entity52 but more memory and storage			1
it 's priced at $ 249 -- half the cost of an @entity1			1
of the two , the early favorite to emerge as the @entity1 's top rival is the @entity52			1
more than any other competitor , @entity51 is able to spar with @entity76 by controlling all the pieces of the puzzle -- from the device itself to the content that you 'll consume on it			0
this " end to end " solution mimics @entity76 's strategy -- it should mean that the user experience is radically better than other @entity1 alternatives			2
and while @entity51 stops short of running its own operating system -- the tablet runs a modified version of @entity93 's @entity40 -- they 've also made changes to the interface that make it feel more holistic			0
the fact that @entity51 is a major distributor of books , movies , tv shows and music has another huge advantage : the company can afford to take a slight loss on the price of the device ( and reportedly does ) , and make up for it by selling content			0
@entity51 has been pushing the @entity52 to its millions of customers , even going so far as to offer free streaming movies and tv shows to all its @entity113 customers ( as it already does on the @entity114 )			2
mark my words : the @entity52 will be the most successful tablet device since the @entity1			1
five hundred dollars is a steep price to pay for many tablet - craving consumers , but paying $ 200 for a similar device is comparatively painless			2
in fact , a research firm surveyed 2,600 consumers to gauge interest in the new tablet and found that pre-launch demand for the @entity52 is higher than demand for the @entity1 before its launch			1
do n't get me wrong : i do n't think the @entity52 is better than the @entity1			2
i do think , however , that the mass market is far more price sensitive than the early - adopter crowd			0
at the very least , the @entity52 is set to become the world 's second-most popular tablet			1
at that price , i would n't even bet against the @entity52 dethroning the @entity1 as the market leader .			2

the @entity1 faces stiff competition from the @entity52 and @entity138 tablets next week
@entity52 , priced at $ 199 , may be the most succesful tablet since the @entity1
the full - color 7 - inch tablet has access to millions of movies , songs , books and magazines
@entity67 's $ 249 nook tablet may also prove popular
