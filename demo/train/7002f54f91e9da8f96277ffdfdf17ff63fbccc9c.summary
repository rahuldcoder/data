-- the racism row involving a @entity3 referee could dominate @entity5 football headlines for some months , after police announced on tuesday that they had launched an investigation into the incident			1
@entity9 , who took charge of @entity12 's controversial 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity13 on sunday , is alleged to have made " inappropriate " comments to two @entity12 players , one of which is claimed to have had a racial nature			1
the footballers in question are midfielders @entity21 of @entity23 and @entity24 of @entity25			0
if the police inquiry escalates to a formal charge for @entity29 , there is unlikely to be any ruling until well into next year			2
it took nine months for @entity32 to be cleared by a criminal court in @entity34 after the @entity12 captain was accused of racially abusing @entity37 defender @entity36 in october 2011			2
the @entity38 , which launched its own investigation into the @entity29 affair on monday , subsequently found @entity32 guilty of racial abuse , banning the 31 - year - old for four matches as a result			1
" an investigation has been launched into alleged comments made during a football match between @entity12 and @entity13 at @entity50 on 28 october 2012 , " read the @entity34 police force statement			1
" this follows on from a complaint received by the @entity53 on 29 october			0
" officers ... are in liaison with @entity12 and the @entity38			1
at this time , the @entity53 has not received any complaint from either @entity12 or the @entity38			1
" @entity57 , a leading human rights barrister who chairs the @entity58 and who has recently staged talks over a black footballers ' association in light of recent racism scandals in the @entity5 game , says he made the complaint to the police			2
" what we do n't want is for it to be swept away under the carpet , " he told @entity70 broadcaster @entity68			0
" it must be subject to a full and proper investigation			0
it is to lend some seriousness and some weight behind what is happening in football			0
" the @entity38 's decision to run its own inquiry at the same time as the police investigation has been welcomed by @entity84 , the chief executive of the @entity85 , who is keen for the incident to be resolved far quicker than the @entity32 affair			1
meanwhile , @entity29 , who refereed the @entity90 football final in august and who has welcomed the @entity38 inquiry , has been stood down from the elite panel of referees set to officiate @entity3 games this weekend			1
the 37 - year - old has already filed what is known as an " extraordinary incident report , " which is believed to deal with an alleged confrontation that took place in the referees ' room after the final whistle			0
the @entity70 @entity104 reported that @entity21 accused @entity9 of abusing him during the post-match conversation , which was observed by @entity12 manager @entity106 , assistant manager @entity107 and chief executive @entity108			2
on tuesday , newspaper reports suggested that neither @entity21 nor @entity24 heard any abusive comments but were informed of them later by their teammates			0
@entity9 and his three assistants were all wearing microphones and earphones , but @entity117 rules do not permit the recording of such conversations as there is no provision for this in the laws of the game .			0
