@entity0 , @entity1 -- representatives from six world powers and @entity5 wrapped up an inconclusive day at the negotiating table friday in @entity1 after attempting to break the deadlock over @entity5 's controversial nuclear program			1
when negotiators from the six - nation diplomatic bloc last sat down with @entity5 's envoy in the @entity1 city of @entity0 in february , they delivered what they characterized as a " fair and balanced offer " to defuse tensions over the @entity5 nuclear program			1
" we are waiting to see how @entity5 responds to the proposal we put on the table , " @entity17 , a @entity18 spokesman , told journalists shortly after negotiations resumed on friday			2
by the end of the day , however , at least one @entity24 diplomat expressed disappointment on the day 's progress			1
" we had a long and substantial discussion on the issues , but we remain a long way apart on the substance , " said a @entity24 diplomat , on condition of anonymity			1
instead of delivering the " concrete response " @entity24 governments had expected , @entity5 announced it is making its own proposal to the negotiating parties			1
@entity5 's deputy chief negotiator said the offer is based on a previous powerpoint presentation that the @entity5 delegation submitted during a round of talks in @entity45 in june 2012			1
" the @entity49 of @entity5 proposed a practical method to implement the @entity45 plan in a smaller scale , " @entity46 said in a statement issued to journalists friday			0
the offer , he said , was aimed at establishing " a new bedrock of cooperation			0
" questions fly around any plan to attack @entity5 details of last february 's offer from the six countries represented across the negotiating table from @entity5 have not yet been made public			2
@entity18 foreign policy chief @entity62 described the offer as a " very clear and concise proposal " for confidence - building measures			0
last month , technical experts from @entity5 and the so - called " @entity74 " countries , which consist of the @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , met for more than 12 hours in @entity75 to discuss the proposal			0
painful sanctions the p5 +1 governments are demanding that @entity5 come clean about its nuclear program , which they suspect includes covert development of nuclear weapons			1
@entity5 consistently denies those charges , arguing it is only enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors for peaceful civilian energy needs			0
but those arguments have failed to prevent @entity24 governments from imposing draconian sanctions that are crippling the @entity5 economy			2
oil exports have plummeted over the past several years , as has the value of @entity5 's currency			2
@entity94 has vowed it will continue to put pressure on @entity96			0
" as long as @entity5 does not take concrete steps to address the concerns of the international community about its nuclear program , the dual - track process continues			1
and that pressure only will increase if @entity5 does not begin to take concrete steps and concrete actions , " said a senior @entity68 administration official in a telephone briefing to journalists this week			0
the official spoke on condition of anonymity			0
lost revenue , foreign investment @entity5 argues that as a signatory to the @entity113 , development of nuclear technology is an inalienable right			2
on the eve of the talks in @entity1 , @entity5 's top nuclear negotiator , @entity120 , repeated this position in a speech given at a university in @entity0			1
" it is the right of the @entity5 people to peaceful nuclear energy and most importantly to enrichment , " @entity120 said			0
a report recently published by the @entity130 concluded that sanctions are unlikely to force @entity96 to give up its nuclear program			2
the report , titled " @entity5 's @entity133 , " highlighted the fact that @entity96 's quest for a nuclear program has been going on for more than half a century , beginning under the rule of the pro-american shah , @entity138 , and continuing under the revolutionary @entity140 republic that overthrew him			1
" the program 's cost -- measured in lost foreign investment and oil revenue -- has been well over $ 100 billion , " @entity130 said			0
@entity2 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
