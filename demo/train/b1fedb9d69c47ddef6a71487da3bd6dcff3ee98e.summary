@entity0 -- a federal agent will be allowed to write a book with an insider 's account of @entity6 , reversing an earlier government attempt to block publication for " morale " reasons			1
however , @entity11 , an agent with the @entity12 , wo n't be allowed to make money on the book			1
a @entity16 law enforcement official familiar with the matter says the @entity18 , @entity12 and the @entity19 will review @entity11 's manuscript and , after making redactions to protect sensitive law enforcement information , will clear it for publication			1
however , federal employee guidelines prohibit @entity11 and other active agents from making a profit from their work in law enforcement , the official said			1
@entity11 was among several agents who claimed whistle - blower status to provide information to @entity32 about the controversial @entity6 operation			2
the operation run by @entity12 agents in @entity36 allowed suspected smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms in 2009 - 10			2
their plan was to use the gun sales to try to prosecute major arms traffickers			0
however , agents had no way to track the weapons , and hundreds wound up in the hands of drug cartels			0
two @entity6 guns were recovered at the scene of a border agent 's slaying in 2010 near the @entity53 border , although it is n't clear whether they were used to kill him			0
@entity11 has enlisted the help of the @entity57 , which last week warned the @entity12 that denying permission to publish his manuscript violated his first amendment rights			1
the @entity57 urged the @entity12 to change its regulations that allow supervisors to block publication for any reason			1
@entity11 's supervisors in the @entity12 's @entity36 office earlier rejected his request to seek a publisher for his book in part because they said it would have " a negative impact on morale , " and " a detremental effect ( sic ) on ( @entity12 ) relationships " with other agencies , the @entity19 and the @entity78			1
in an october 8 interview with @entity80 , host of @entity1 's " @entity81 , " @entity11 rejected the claims about morale or about the @entity12 's relationship with other agencies			1
" i think what happened , what we were doing , what the agency was doing , the @entity36 field division , the operation itself , i think that is what is harmful for morale , " @entity11 said			2
" i think that is what is a detriment -- to not only our relationship with other federal agencies , but our relationship with the @entity16 people and their trust in us			2
" the @entity6 operation gave rise to more than a year of political controversy for the @entity18 , and eventually prompted @entity106 @entity105 to sanction attorney general @entity107 for contempt of @entity32 in a legal dispute over the @entity106 's refusal to turn over documents			0
@entity107 has said tactics used in " @entity6 " never should have been allowed			0
@entity11 said he suffered retaliation after providing testimony to @entity32			0
@entity18 documents released in the congressional investigation showed that @entity11 sought permission from supervisors to use some of the same tactics he later criticized in @entity6			0
@entity11 told congressional investigators he did so assuming that his request would be rejected and that then he could point out the problems in @entity6			0
instead , his request was approved			0
after @entity11 last week complained about his book being blocked , @entity12 officials acknowledged that his supervisors had noted morale as one reason			1
however , the agency said the rejection was " not about @entity131 rights			2
this is about a current employee trying to profit financially from knowledge he has gained while currently employed as a special agent			0
" the @entity12 cited federal ethics rules that state : " an employee , including a special government employee , shall not receive compensation from any source other than the government for teaching , speaking or writing that relates to the employee 's official duties			1

@entity11 , an @entity12 agent , wants to write an insider 's account of the @entity16 operation
@entity57 said forbidding the book 's publication violated @entity11 's @entity131 rights
agencies will review his manuscript , make redactions , law enforcement official says
earlier , the government said it was blocking publication for morale , ethics reasons
