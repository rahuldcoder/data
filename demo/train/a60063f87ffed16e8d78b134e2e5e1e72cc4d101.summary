@entity0 -- a sharp disagreement over the future treatment of undocumented workers on @entity6 's farms is holding up progress on the comprehensive immigration reform bill being considered by the @entity10 's so - called " @entity9			1
" the two key sticking points are wages and the number of visas to be granted to undocumented farm workers , two sources close to the talks confirmed friday			1
" it 's the one major unresolved issue , " one of the sources told @entity1			0
the sources were unable to provide specifics in terms of the number of visas or wage levels under consideration			2
but , generally speaking , agricultural businesses have an interest in more visas and lower wages			1
labor leaders , in contrast , typically support fewer visas and higher wages			2
aside from the agricultural dispute , both sources stressed that the sheer complexity of the major reform bill could slow the timetable for its public unveiling			1
senators are hoping to release the bill next week , but a significant amount of time is required for staffers from multiple offices to work their way through the lengthy proposal			0
the @entity48 - controlled @entity10 and the @entity50 - controlled @entity49 each are working on immigration reform plans			1
both chambers are expected to advance their respective blueprints some point soon after @entity55 returns next week from its spring break			0
the agricultural dispute is just one component of a plan that would provide the first major overhaul of @entity6 's immigration laws since 1986			2
among other things , the @entity10 bill aims to provide a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented residents			0
it would also create a new system for assessing the state of border security			0
members of the @entity10 's " @entity9 " are sen. @entity72 , @entity74 - @entity73 ; sen. @entity75 , @entity76 ; sen. @entity77 , @entity78 ; sen. @entity79 , @entity78 ; sen. @entity80 , @entity81 ; sen. @entity82 , @entity83 ; sen. @entity84 , @entity85 , and sen. @entity86 , @entity88 - @entity87			1
