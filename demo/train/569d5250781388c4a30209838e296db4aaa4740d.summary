@entity0 -- a key @entity2 passed comprehensive health care reform legislation friday , moving president @entity5 's domestic priority one step closer to congressional approval			2
speaker @entity8 says @entity2 @entity9 will return to their districts ready to defend the bill			2
the vote occurred as the @entity2 adjourned for its august recess			1
the 31 - 28 vote in the @entity15 came after several days of intense and often contentious negotiations between @entity18 @entity2 leaders and an influential group of fiscal conservatives in the party			1
three members of the @entity9 ' conservative @entity24 caucus -- @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity27 of @entity28 and @entity29 of @entity30 -- voted against the bill , along with two other @entity9 , @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity34 of @entity35			2
the committee 's bill will now be merged with two separate versions passed by other @entity2 panels before being considered by the full chamber in september			1
the prospects for health care reform in the @entity43 , however , remain unclear			2
@entity9 remain deeply divided , with a number of liberals expressing strong opposition to concessions made to the party 's so - called @entity24 conservatives on the @entity15			1
the fate of health care reform also remains uncertain in the @entity51 , where the @entity52 recently postponed its long - awaited vote on a bipartisan compromise plan until after the august recess			1
the coming fights in both chambers serve as a backdrop for what is expected to be a month of furious campaigning for and against the bill as members of @entity63 meet with constituents back home over the break			0
house speaker @entity8 said friday that @entity2 @entity9 will return to their districts with talking points and memos to help them rebut opponents running " a shock and awe campaign ... to perpetuate the status quo			0
" " facts mean nothing " to insurance industry executives and others opposed to change , she said			1
" misrepresentation is the currency of their realm			0
" @entity8 did not indicate , however , how @entity18 divisions in the @entity2 might be overcome when @entity63 returns in the fall			0
on thursday , 57 members of the @entity83 sent a letter to @entity8 and others complaining that the agreement with the @entity87 weakened language creating a government - funded health insurance option			1
" any bill that does not provide , at a minimum , for a public option with reimbursement rates based on @entity97 rates -- not negotiated rates -- is unacceptable , " the letter said			1
the revised bill calls for the government - run public insurance option to be reimbursed on rates determined by negotiations with the insurance industry			1
the original version called for the same reimbursement rates as in the government 's @entity97 program for senior citizens			1
the progressive democrats also argued that cuts to the bill 's overall price would shortchange subsidies meant to help low - and moderate - income @entity114 buy health insurance			1
some of those concerns were addressed friday when the @entity15 boosted funding for subsidies and added a provision empowering the federal government to directly negotiate prescription drug rates in the public plan			1
the agreement with the @entity87 , estimated to lower the cost of the @entity2 plan by $ 100 billion over a decade , would also exempt businesses with payrolls below $ 500,000 from having to provide health coverage to employees			1
" we can compromise no more , " warned rep. @entity129 , co-chair of the 81 - member @entity83			2
" when leaders of the @entity2 meet ... to consider the three bills and produce a final one , we expect that it will retain a robust public option			1
if it does n't , we will vote against it			0
" opposition from progressive @entity9 and some conservative @entity138 who want additional cost cuts could defeat the bill			2
@entity8 admitted that she preferred the original bill , but noted that much of the new language matched a proposal supported by sen. @entity145 , @entity146 , a longtime champion of health care reform who is revered by @entity9			0
she also pointed out that the bill could change when the @entity2 and @entity51 negotiate a final measure in coming months			0
on the @entity51 side , key republicans in the @entity52 negotiations said wednesday that they were unlikely to complete work on a compromise plan before the august break			0
sen. @entity156 of @entity157 and sen. @entity158 of @entity159 said too many issues remained unresolved to sign on to a deal by the time the @entity51 breaks for its recess on august 7			2
on thursday , @entity156 said pressure from the @entity164 and @entity18 leaders to speed the process did n't help			0
" it would be better for me to say that instead of saying there 's no way we can cut a deal , there 's no way we can get all the compromising that needs to be done by an artificial deadline of friday of this week , " @entity156 said			0
" so we 're going to continue to work together this week and next week			0
but we 're getting close			0
" @entity9 had hoped the @entity52 could finish its work before the august break to show progress toward health legislation			0
@entity1 's @entity180 and @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
