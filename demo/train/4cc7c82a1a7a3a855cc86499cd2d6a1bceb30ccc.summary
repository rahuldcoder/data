@entity0 -- @entity3 voters retired @entity4 on tuesday after 36 years in the @entity5 , punishing him for the qualities he considered assets : seniority , expertise in foreign policy and a penchant for bipartisan cooperation			1
@entity14 @entity13 overwhelmingly chose to replace @entity4 with @entity15 , a longtime @entity13 operative who benefited from manpower and money from tea party activists and outside groups determined to topple the six - term veteran			1
six years ago , @entity4 ran unopposed by @entity21 , much less republicans , and cruised to another term			1
but this time , the 80 - year - old was drummed out of office by many of the same voters who sent him repeatedly to @entity28 but now say they want a change			0
analysis : @entity4 's grass roots withered @entity4 conceded the race about an hour after the polls closed , telling supporters that he congratulated @entity15 on " a hard - fought race			1
" " i want to see a @entity13 in the @entity36 , " @entity4 said			2
" i want to see my friend @entity37 have a @entity13 majority in the @entity5			2
i hope that @entity15 prevails in november so he can contribute to that @entity13 majority			2
" @entity15 , @entity3 's state treasurer , will face @entity41 @entity40 in november in a contest the nonpartisan @entity43 calls safely @entity13			1
" this has n't been about me			0
this has been about all of you			0
you got this done , " @entity15 told supporters during a victory speech in @entity0			1
he thanked his supporters and led them in a round of applause for @entity4			1
" when i began this campaign , senator @entity4 was not my enemy , " @entity15 said			1
" he is not now my enemy			0
he will never by my enemy			0
he was simply , over the last 15 months , my opponent			0
" but now , he said , @entity13 need " to get this country back on a course where all can rise and all sense the excitement of the dream that is @entity62			0
" follow all of tuesday 's political results at @entity1 's @entity64 in recent years , @entity4 had served as chairman , then ranking @entity13 on the @entity66			1
the panel 's current leader , sen. @entity67 , called @entity4 's defeat " a tragedy for the @entity5 " tuesday			1
@entity67 , @entity71 , said @entity4 could be compared to the renowned @entity62 sen. @entity72 , an @entity73 " who is remembered today not for one loss , but for a legacy of following the facts and speaking the truth despite the political risks			1
" " this is a tough period in @entity62 politics , but i 'd like to think that we 'll again see a @entity5 where @entity4 's brand of thoughtful , mature and bipartisan work is respected and rewarded , " @entity67 said in a written statement			1
" that kind of seriousness of purpose should never go out of fashion			0
" @entity15 's move to oust the widely respected senior senator was initially viewed as an uphill battle			2
@entity4 's campaign released a poll in february showing the incumbent up by 25 points			1
but then outside conservative groups fed up with his penchant for compromise began pouring money into the race , and they turned it into the first stand of so - called @entity104 in a contested primary			0
as polls started to show the race tighten , tea party groups mobilized grassroots supporters and turned the @entity111 race into a national referendum on the state of the @entity13			2
the @entity114 , a conservative pro-growth group , perhaps played the biggest role , releasing a barrage of ads that framed @entity4 as out of step with his own party			1
the group endorsed @entity15 in mid-february and spent close to $ 1.5 million on television ads -- close to what @entity4 's own campaign spent on tv spots			1
but it also collected more than $ 300,000 from donors and gave it to the @entity15 campaign , making their total spending on the race close to $ 2 million			2
@entity131 , president of the @entity114 , used the win as a warning to other @entity13 who did n't toe the conservative line			2
" @entity15 's victory truly sends a message to the liberals in the @entity13 : voters are rejecting the policies that led to record debt and diminished economic freedom , and they will continue to be rejected in elections throughout @entity62 , " @entity131 said in a written statement			2
@entity4 focused his pitch on his more than three decades in the @entity5 as a leading voice on foreign policy			1
" i 'm still working every day			0
i 'm getting warheads out of @entity149			0
and missiles , things that are of very grave consequence			0
i would just say that people may not have their eye on the ball , but i do , " @entity4 told @entity1 after greeting voters in @entity154			2
but perplexed @entity13 strategists say that @entity4 's focus talking nukes at a time of widespread joblessness was off - key , and a major factor in his defeat			1
@entity166 sen. @entity165 , who endorsed @entity4 , told @entity1 the " moral of the story is play offense , not defense			2
" unlike @entity13 colleagues who got toppled by tea party insurgents two years ago , @entity4 had time to prepare for his primary challenge and tack right but he chose not to			2
instead , he voted for legislation unpopular with the @entity13 base , such as allowing children of illegal immigrants to have a path to @entity62 citizenship			0
in ads and in the mail , @entity4 's opponents repeatedly linked him to the president , calling him president @entity184 's favorite @entity13			1
@entity185 , a longtime @entity4 supporter whose grandmother was close to the senator , came out to vote for his opponent this time			0
" if he was running for something to do with foreign policy , i 'd be all over it , " @entity185 told @entity1			1
but he said now , " i think he 's done			0
" @entity185 ' vote was more about voting @entity4 out than putting @entity15 in , he said			1
@entity4 's decision to reside primarily in his home in @entity195 , @entity196 , outside @entity28 , instead of @entity3 played into his opponent 's line that he was " out of touch " and no longer able to represent the interests of his own constituents			1
" he 's not been here			0
he 's been absent for a long time , " @entity15 told @entity1 after meeting voters in @entity203 on tuesday afternoon			2
after his state residency was challenged , @entity4 registered to vote at his son 's family farm and repaid hotel bills he said were inappropriately charged to his @entity5 account			1
and he argued his choice about staying close to the @entity210 was about raising his four sons together with his wife , which he said was evidence of " family values " and had no bearing on his job performance			0
while @entity15 and his allies did n't explicitly argue the 80 - year - old senator was no longer up to another six - year term , some voters in @entity3 said while they admired his long list of accomplishments for the state -- they just thought it was time for him to step down			0
but @entity4 's supporters say his ability to work with @entity21 and his foreign policy expertise earned him their vote for another term			1
" i liked the fact that sen. @entity4 is n't a strict party person , " @entity231 , a voter in @entity232 , said tuesday afternoon			1
but @entity231 also conceded that a defeat this election not be the worst outcome for @entity4			0
" if he loses , maybe it 'll be a blessing			0
maybe he can enjoy life a little , " she said			0
what was striking about @entity4 's loss is how evident it is @entity14 voters respect him			1
many @entity13 voters told @entity1 they were voting against him for the first time in decades , and it was clear they felt bad about it			0
" i hated to depart , " @entity250 said			0
but he quickly added , " we ca n't let @entity184 dictate to us anymore what he 's doing			0
" @entity250 spoke in a hushed tone only a few feet away from @entity4 , working the polls			0
minutes earlier , he approached the senator and thanked him for his service .			0

" you got this done , " rival @entity15 tells supporters after win
the @entity5 fight pitted moderate republicans against the more conservative wing of the party
