-- as the sun set sunday evening , millions of people in a mammoth chunk of the @entity4 and @entity5 finally got relief from scorching heat -- though , for many of them , it wo n't last long			1
summer has been out in full force for days , baking areas from @entity13 to @entity14 to @entity15 in life - threatening heat , and unleashing thunderstorms that knocked out power to millions and killed 13 people on friday and saturday			1
then , three more people died sunday afternoon after a fresh batch of storms			1
between june 24 and saturday , 1,928 record - high temperatures were broken or tied nationwide , not including new ones expected from sunday that still are n't in the @entity26 's official count			1
many cities and towns in the @entity29 and @entity30 saw temperatures sunday that topped 100 degrees @entity32 , much like they 've experienced in the few days prior , and the @entity33 also saw blistering heat			2
the @entity35 warned , for instance , that the heat index ( or what it actually feels like ) near the @entity40 coast could hit 120 degrees			1
thunderstorms rolling across some of the roasting locales late sunday afternoon brought some relief , but also danger as well			2
the @entity35 reported that a man in @entity47 in eastern @entity40 , died around 4:30 p.m. when a shed fell on him as he was trying to store his golf cart			1
a few minutes later and about 15 miles east in @entity51 , strong storm - related winds knocked over a tree that fell on a couple in a golf cart , killing them both			1
these deaths were tied to a batch of storms that affected not only @entity40 , but also @entity59 and @entity15			1
another band moved east from the @entity62 area through @entity63 , at one point prompting a tornado warning			0
@entity66 , an @entity67 spokeswoman , said the latest storms downed trees and power lines to produce yet more outages			2
yet as of sunday night , there were no reports of new fatalities			0
the forecast in that state , like in many others through the @entity30 , @entity29 and @entity78 , calls for slightly cooling monday , compared to over the weekend			2
yet temperature drops are all relative : it will be cooler , for instance , for residents of @entity83 , @entity84 , but they can still expect a high of 99 , and a heat index of 103 , on monday			1
in @entity88 , @entity63 , the thermometer is forecast to rise as high as 96 , though it should feel even warmer			0
many other locales should be even more sweltering , with highs monday forecast yet again to be around or above 100 degrees from @entity13 to @entity59			2
the lack of any significant let up in the blistering conditions is a concern , authorities say , because the effects of heat can be cumulative -- so the longer you experience it , the more likely you are to experience conditions such as heat stroke , dehydration and the like			0
" current indications are that this heat wave may continue for much of the upcoming work week , " the weather service 's @entity105 bureau warned			0
" do not wait until the heat wave has lasted for several days , take action today to protect your health and continue to do so			0
" hundreds of thousands of people in @entity114 through @entity115 are still dealing with this heat without the benefits of electricity , due to a derecho -- or massive storm usually with straight - line wind damage -- that barreled eastward late friday and into saturday and was fueled , in part , by the extreme heat			1
the destruction prompted state of emergency declarations by governors of @entity115 , @entity63 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
deaths tied to those storms were reported from @entity63 to @entity132 , all of them linked to downed trees except for the electrocution of a man in @entity138			0
will 2012 be the hottest summer on record ? @entity129 had the highest death toll , at seven , with the state department of @entity142 noting the deaths were spread across four different counties			0
and in @entity132 , 2 - year - old and 7 - year - old cousins died after a fallen tree crashed on the tent they were huddling inside in @entity151 , state @entity146 spokesman @entity145 said			2
while down from a peak of about 4 million from right after the storms hit , the number of storm - related outages was still dangerously high given that people were trying to get by without working air conditioning or ice			1
record heat , storms bring despair , ' horror ' one of the most affected utilities was @entity165 , which had around 425,000 customers out of power as of 10 p.m. sunday			1
widespread outages were reported further east as well , including over 310,000 @entity170 customers in @entity129 plus more than 490,000 outages in @entity115 for customers of @entity173 and @entity174			0
" it 's the combination of heat and power outages that are hitting people , " @entity66 from @entity63 's emergency management agency said , predicting some may not get electricity until " well into the week			1
" " as the days continue with food and without power , we will just have to mobilize resources			0
" one such initiative , ordered by @entity63 gov. @entity186 , is to have @entity188 troops check on and help the state 's most vulnerable , primarily the elderly and the ill. cities throughout the affected regions offered water at certain sites and opened cooling shelters , including 35 in @entity129 alone , to help people stay cool			0
photos : storm damage in @entity138 emergency rooms in @entity200 , @entity115 , filled up over the weekend by people looking to escape the heat , said @entity203 , deputy secretary for the state 's @entity204 and @entity206			1
she noted that libraries and community centers across the state would stay open late to act as cooling centers			0
" this is not a one - day situation ; it is a multiday challenge , " said @entity129 gov. @entity211 , who called it the largest power outage unrelated to a hurricane in his state 's history			2
instagram down in mass power outage @entity0 's @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
