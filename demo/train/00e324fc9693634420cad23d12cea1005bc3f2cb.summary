-- the saying goes that a bad workman blames his tools but @entity4 refused to pin a shock defeat in @entity6 on his new racquet			1
@entity4 , who is experimenting with a larger tennis racquet at the @entity10 tennis championships , was stunned in the semi-finals by qualifier @entity12 , the world no. 114			1
" he was better than me , " said @entity4 , who lost a tight match 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) to the @entity16			1
" i do n't think it had much to do with the racquet			0
" both sets could have gone either way			0
it 's clearly a pity i could n't win either of the sets because i was starting to feel better towards the end of the match			0
" unfortunately i could n't push him further and create more chances			0
" i tried everything i could at this tournament			0
it 's been a difficult week			0
" @entity4 entered the @entity6 clay - court tournament to try and rediscover some form after a dismal @entity34			1
the @entity36 winner of a record 17 grand slams made a shock second - round exit at the @entity41 championships at the hands of 116th ranked @entity43			1
part of his plan to get back to his best has been a decision to play with a larger 98 - inch square frame racquet -- eight inches larger than his previous racquet			2
explaining his decision to try out the racquet in @entity6 earlier this week , @entity4 said on the @entity54 website : " i 've been very close on numerous occasions to changing racquets in a bigger way			2
" but then very often , time was the issue			0
maybe also just the records of grand slams - i was always keeping on playing quarters and semis - so then it was also a bit more difficult to change it because of the time			2
" after i lost at @entity34 , i thought this is a good time to go and test the racquets , to take a bit of time off and then add some tournaments and see was there enough time to change or not			1
" i 'm happy i did the change and now we 'll see how it goes			0
" @entity4 -- who dropped from third to fifth in the world rankings after his @entity34 loss -- will now head home to @entity36 to play at @entity77 next week			1
@entity12 now faces @entity78 for the @entity6 title after the @entity80 beat @entity82 's @entity81 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) .			2

@entity4 loses in the semi-finals of the @entity85
*federer* beaten by world @entity16 @entity12 in straight sets
the @entity36 17 - time grand slam winner is *trialling* a new racquet with a larger frame
@entity4 said early @entity34 exit was a good time to make the switch
