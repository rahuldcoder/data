" it is the search for justice for @entity5 that has brought us to this moment , " @entity31 told reporters			2
" we did not come to this decision lightly			0
" what do you think about the decision to charge @entity1 ? @entity1 's claim of self - defense failed to quell an uproar about the decision by @entity30 police not to initially charge him and about @entity2 's " stand your ground " law , which allows the use of deadly force by anyone who feels a reasonable threat of death or serious injury			1
the case also sparked a nationwide debate about race and racial profiling			0

" i will be seeking his release , " he said of @entity1			2
@entity31 said @entity1 had the right to appear before a magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest			1

in a letter last month to the @entity149 , @entity1 's father wrote that his son has been unfairly portrayed as a racist			1
although details of the evening shooting remain murky , what is known is that @entity5 , an @entity155 , ventured out from his father 's fiancee 's home in @entity30 to a nearby convenience store , where he bought a bag of @entity161 and an @entity162			1
on his way back , he had a confrontation with @entity1 , who is @entity71 , and @entity1 shot him			2
@entity1 had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood , according to authorities			2
in the call , @entity1 said he was following @entity5 after the teen started to run , after which the dispatcher told him , " we do n't need you to do that			1
" @entity1 pursued @entity5 anyway before saying he lost sight of him			1
according to an @entity149 story later confirmed by @entity30 police , @entity1 told authorities that after he briefly lost track of @entity5 , the teen approached him			1
after the two exchange words , @entity1 said , he reached for his cell phone , and then @entity5 punched him in the nose			1
@entity1 said @entity5 pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk			1
audio experts earlier this month told @entity0 that they do n't believe it 's @entity1 who can be heard yelling " help ! " in the background of a different 911 call related to the shooting			1
they compared those screams with @entity1 's voice , as recorded in the 911 call he made minutes earlier			1
authorities have said @entity1 was not immediately charged because there were no grounds , at the outset , to disprove his account that he 'd acted to protect himself			2
a police report indicated the volunteer was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head			0

no matter what state attorney @entity31 determines following her investigation of the @entity5 tragedy , i trust in the goodness of all @entity2 citizens to allow our justice system to reach an appropriate conclusion in this case			2
" @entity19 replaces @entity227 and @entity228 , the two lawyers who had been giving legal advice to @entity1			2
they told reporters tuesday that they had lost contact with their client and no longer represent him			0
attorney general @entity234 pledged wednesday that the @entity237 will " conduct a thorough and independent review of the evidence			0
" " i know that many of you are greatly -- and rightly -- concerned " about @entity5 's death , @entity234 said -- " a young man whose future has been lost to the ages			1
" the department 's investigation , launched three weeks ago , remains open , he said , which " prevents me from talking in detail about this matter			0
" @entity234 did note , however , that @entity237 officials had traveled to @entity30 to meet with @entity5 's family , community members and local authorities			1
