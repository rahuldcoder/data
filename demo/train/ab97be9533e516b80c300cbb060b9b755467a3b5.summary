-- ten years ago , @entity3 , eager to come up with its own version of the unexpected @entity7 reality hit , the competition series " @entity2 , " adapted a @entity9 series called " now or @entity10 " and proudly presented it -- with pro-wrestling - style fanfare -- as its newest series : " @entity13			1
" monday night , @entity3 revived " @entity13 " in a version best described as " new and unimproved			1
" the show , which has contestants do disgusting things , is alarmingly gross , no question			1
but should we worry that its return marks a new and deeper descent into depravity for @entity25 tv - watchers ? a jump - off into a new binge of revolting reality - show programming ? never fear			2
there are other factors at play			0
for one thing , the show 's earlier version had raised the bar very high for disgusting			1
we 've already gone there			0
more important , it 's @entity3			1
only at @entity3 , where audience levels are well below every broadcast network , save @entity41 and the @entity42 , would it be considered progress to reach back to a decade - old tv series -- and a horrible one , at that			1
then again , @entity3 is the network that in its most recent attempts to revive old tv series , looked over the entire history of broadcast television and opted to present new versions of ... " @entity52 " and " @entity53			1
" " @entity13 " is a known entity -- not a good one , but a known one -- and that makes it easier to promote than a series created from scratch			1
and " @entity13 , " like any reality competition show , is the type of program that can be plugged into any airtime hole , in any order , and it 'll get more viewers than whatever it 's replacing			1
for many , even seeing someone smothering on scorpions or immersed in blood ( as in its premiere monday night ) beats watching " @entity74			0
" it did n't have to be , of course			2
there were other new @entity3 shows from 2001 that could have been brought back instead			1
" @entity79 , " a quiz show based on another series from abroad , premiered that year			0
so did " @entity82 , " a sitcom starring @entity84 , which i 'll bet not even she remembers clearly			0
and " @entity87 " -- the sitcom , not the cooking show			0
so to be fair , @entity3 's current management does n't exactly have a lock on developing bad tv			1
but each of those bottom - of - the - barrel @entity3 shows from a decade ago -- and sadly , as a tv critic , i saw and recall them all -- was better than " @entity13			1
i 'd say that " @entity13 , " as a programming strategy for the fourth - ranked broadcast network , has an air of desperation			1
except that the air is a lot more foul than that			0
it smells , in fact , a lot like cow 's blood			0
in monday 's two - hour 2011 revival premiere , returning host @entity108 ( how proud he must be , to land that job twice ) explained to the four pairs of contestants that one of their tasks was to climb inside a tank filled with " 3,000 gallons of cow 's blood , " submerge themselves to locate cow 's hearts lying on the bottom of the tank and place them in the mouth of their partners , whose job was to spit them into smaller containers next to the giant tank			2
there were other tasks , too , such as chewing and eating live scorpions , which made some of the contestants gag			0
at home , i was n't far behind			0
the stunts on " @entity13 , " @entity108 said helpfully at the start of each hour , were designed and supervised by trained professionals			2
" they should not be attempted , " he added , " by anyone , anywhere , anytime			0
" if you 're watching " @entity13 " to begin with , you just might need that warning			2
( and if you need it , you probably are n't bright enough to heed it			0
) i 'm a tv - viewing professional			0
here 's my warning : " ' @entity13 ' should not be viewed by anyone , anywhere , anytime			1
" the real shame of it is , @entity3 has some really good programming coming up early next year , starting with the musical drama " smash " and the psychological thriller " @entity157			2
" preceding those with " @entity13 " not only sends the wrong message , it gathers the wrong audience			2
if @entity3 wants stupid , " @entity13 " is the perfect smelly bait			1
it 's also , amazingly , the modern equivalent of " @entity165 , " the 1969 @entity167 parody film starring @entity168 as @entity169 , a wealthy man who spent a fortune proving that people would do anything for money			0
in that film 's climax , @entity175 filled a giant outdoor vat with animal waste -- blood , urine , feces -- and floated money on top of it , daring people to wade in and grab the cash			0
and they did , to the tune of @entity191 's " @entity190			0
" all these years later , " @entity13 " and @entity3 have made that ridiculous image come true : people wading in animal waste in exchange for cash			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

@entity200 : @entity3 's " @entity13 " redux is even more disgusting
it 's not a new wave of gross - out shows , @entity200 says ; it 's a desperate @entity3
network is *relaunching* known entity because it 's easier to promote , he says
@entity200 's *advice* : " @entity13 " should n't be viewed by anyone , anytime
