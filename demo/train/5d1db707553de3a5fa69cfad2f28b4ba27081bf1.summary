@entity1 , @entity0 -- historically , the tech industry has not been especially hospitable to women			1
in 2009 , the @entity6 @entity5 released a list of the 20 leading occupations of employed women			1
none of them was in the technical field			0
that same year , only 3 % of the @entity13 of @entity15 companies were women , according to the @entity17			1
from coders to venture capitalists , women remain a small minority in most tech - related businesses			1
this issue was a recurring theme at last week 's @entity26 festival in @entity1 , @entity0 , where attendees gathered at women 's - only parties and panels featured such titles as " @entity32 : getting more women into @entity34 " conversations focused on the unique set of challenges women face as minorities in the tech workplace			1
this isolation , they said , spurs a need to gather and to collectively exchange ideas			0
as a result , an increasing number of groups has formed to help women find mentors and build their confidence			1
@entity51 is the executive director of @entity52 , an nonprofit based in @entity1			1
the organization provides science , technology , engineering and math ( @entity55 ) programming for girls outside of the classroom			1
" less than 12 percent of @entity55 jobs in @entity6 are filled by women			1
so for us , making sure that more girls feel that they have access to @entity55 jobs is critical , " she said			1
" having more women in the field is important for innovation			1
" in interviews with @entity2 , many female developers said they felt they had to fight for respect or deal with internal issues of self - doubt to advance in their career			1
" as a female , there 's kind of that perception that you do n't have certain skills or reasoning , " said @entity78 , a software developer for @entity79 in @entity1			0
the perception goes , " you are just not as good at science as males , or else why would n't there be more females ( in scientific fields ) ? " women at @entity26 also talked about the desire to be respected in the tech workplace , not just liked			1
" how we have been conditioned to be maybe works fine for being the popular girl in school			0
but at a certain point in our professional life , being the nice one does not get us to the level of respect or responsibility that we want , " said @entity99 , a @entity101 - based life and leadership coach for women			1
" we have to be more authoritative and more assertive and be ok with not being liked by everyone , " she added			0
@entity114 , sitting in an audience at a panel on women entrepreneurs , jokingly refers to herself as the only female venture capitalist in @entity1			1
she said a lack of assertiveness can prevent women from properly scaling their new business venture and asking for money			1
" women generally want less money than they really need , and they do n't show me a big business plan , " @entity114 said			2
" i challenge women to think about scaling their business and asking for enough funds to cover their projected growth			2
" as conferences like @entity26 bring together thought leaders from all over the world , women here hope these discussions can help close the gender gap in tech fields			1
business strategist @entity136 of @entity137 offered a solution , broken into three parts			0
" women need to become better at stating clearly what they want , " she said			2
" we 're not very good at stating clearly and consistently what our contribution is going to be and asking for our part in the project			0
" the second part of that is be better at self - promoting			0
as women , as wives , as daughters , as partners , as team members , we tend to be very good at promoting others			2
we tend to really suck at highlighting what we 're good at , " she added			0
" we need to find a way to be ok with the results we bring to the table and being ok with being confident in those results			0
" finally , she stressed the need for women to find mentors , whether those mentors are male or female			2
however , having a female role model can help women visualize their own future , she said			2
the desire to connect other like - minded women and build a community led developer @entity170 to form all - girl hack nights in @entity1			2
attendees come together to exchange ideas and work on projects			0
" if it was open to men , it would be mostly men			0
the fact that it 's exclusive to women helps bring women out , " @entity180 said			2
" it 's just a little easier when you know this is for you			0
" " being the only [ female developer ] , you do n't have role models , " @entity78 said			0
" then you go into these groups and you see distinguished engineers at @entity79 that are females , and it encourages you to be like , ' yeah , she did it			0
she went through the same path , and it 's something that i can follow			0
' " " i think these organizations form because women have certain issues that do n't pertain to guys , " agreed @entity78			1
" you 're more comfortable voicing these opinions to someone who is sympathetic and understanding of what you are going through			0
" such segregation by gender is not a popular idea to everyone in the industry			1
but @entity51 said they are necessary because time and time again , educators see women drop out of nonsegregated programs			2
despite the bleak statistics , there was plenty of optimism in @entity1			0
with so many people working together to increase opportunities for women in tech , many of the woman @entity2 interviewed at @entity26 said they do n't think this conversation will be happening in 10 to 15 years			1
" development is becoming more social			0
they ( men and women ) are talking			2
they 're not hiding in basements			0
i think that 's really good for this industry , " @entity170 said			2
@entity78 also is hopeful about the future of the industry , thanks in part to the rise of social media , which tends to attracts more women , she said			1
" the social computing aspect brings a lot more people , " she said			0
" i see more and more women in the technical field			0

conversations at @entity26 focus on issues women face as minorities in workplace
less than 12 % of ( science and tech ) jobs in @entity6 filled by women , nonprofit director says
women at @entity26 hope these discussions could close the gender gap in the industry
