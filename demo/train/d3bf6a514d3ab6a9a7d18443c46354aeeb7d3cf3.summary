justice @entity0 rarely speaks from the bench but his comments in less formal settings are often illuminating , often controversial -- especially on race			1
it is a topic that continues to engage the national debate , especially when it comes from the mind of the @entity11 's only @entity10 - @entity10 jurist			1
@entity0 spoke this week at a small gathering of students and faculty at a @entity16 college , where he echoed previous statements on the not - so subtle racism he remembers experiencing when leaving his native @entity19			1
" the worst i have been treated was by northern liberal elites			2
the absolute worst i have ever been treated , " the 65 - year - old justice said			1
" the worst things that have been done to me , the worst things that have been said about me , are by northern liberal elites , not by the people of @entity25 , @entity26 , " his hometown			2
his comments were first reported by @entity31 , but confirmed by several people who attended the tuesday event at @entity34 , a nondenominational @entity35 school			1
social media reaction strong the reaction from social media has been strong , reflecting the unique pull @entity0 commands , despite his low - key , press - adverse persona			1
that theme of personal , political , and cultural isolation in his early professional life informs much of @entity0 ' current views on hot - button issues like race , seen most keenly in rulings issued from the bench			1
last year , he sided with the conservative majority to strike down a key section of the landmark @entity52 , blocking the federal government from using its most potent enforcement tool			2
no longer can the @entity56 rely on a decades - old formula to require states with a past history of voter discrimination against minorities to " pre-clear " any changes in their voting procedures			2
in a concurrence , @entity0 went further , saying the @entity52 provision was completely outdated and unconstitutional			1
" today , our @entity66 has changed , " he wrote			2
a long - held belief now the justice 's comments this week echo his long - held belief that government and society at large is overly focused and overly sensitive on trying to solve perceived racial problems			1
" my sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference - conscious than i was in the 1960s when i went to school , " he told students			0
" to my knowledge , i was the first black kid in @entity25 , @entity26 , to go to a white [ @entity83 ] school			0
rarely did the issue of race come up			0
now , name a day it does n't come up			1
differences in race , differences in sex , somebody does n't look at you right , somebody says something			1
if i had been as sensitive as that in the 1960s , i 'd still be in @entity25			0
every person in this room has endured a slight			0
" @entity0 has also consistently voted as a justice to eliminate affirmative action in college admission criteria , including a case from last term			1
" although cloaked in good intentions , the university 's racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping , " said @entity0 in a june decision limiting use of race at the @entity108 to achieve diversity in the student body			1
comments are familiar @entity117 senior legal analyst @entity116 said wednesday the justice 's latest comments are familiar			1
" this is very consistent with how he has expressed himself about race throughout his entire career , " said @entity116			0
" race is something to be overcome by individual initiative			0
any problems you might have can be overcome by hard work and not collective action			0
" @entity0 has long been perceived as a contradiction , an @entity10 man and self - professed civil rights activist in college with liberal views , who became increasingly conservative as his career advanced in government			1
he wrote about the transformation in his memoir , " @entity141 , " saying he felt " tricked " by whites , when recruited to attend @entity143			0
" i was bitter toward the white bigots whom i held responsible for the unjust treatment of blacks , " he wrote			0
" but even more bitter toward those ostensibly unprejudiced whites who pretended to side with black people while using them to further their own political and social ends			2
" most famously , he voiced that frustration during his 1991 @entity153 confirmation to the high court , when aggressively fighting off accusations of prior sexual harassment			0
" this is a circus			0
it 's a national disgrace			0
it is a high - tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves , " he said			0
sources close to him say the memories of his wrenching public ordeal are not forgotten by any means , but the experience , they say , has given him a greater appreciation of the unique role he now occupies			2
controversial hearing for most @entity175 , @entity0 slipped into virtual anonymity after he took his judicial oath			1
he shuns interviews and rarely speaks during arguments			0
in fact , he has gone eight years without speaking substantively , when cases are presented in the public sessions			0
but those close to him say you do n't know the real @entity0			1
" @entity0 is known as being quiet and taciturn , and has n't asked a question in years , " said @entity185 , a 2007 law clerk who remains close to him			1
" he 's actually an incredibly great storyteller			0
he could talk for hours very easily			0
if you do get into a conversation with him , it 's normally a very long and engaging process			2
" behind the closed marble hallways of the court , @entity0 is well known for his booming voice , hearty laugh , and friendly manner			1
colleagues say they are amazed he seems to know every one of the several hundred employees by their names , as well as their families and their problems			0
he shatters the mold in many ways , and is especially close friends on the court with justice @entity206 , whose views are considered liberal			2
the two can often be spotted on the bench whispering in each other 's ears , sharing an occasional laugh			2
" there are a lot of people who do n't like the fact that he breaks their expectations , " @entity213 said			2
" they expect him as an @entity10 to be toeing the liberal line , and he 's his own man			0
you know , he 's his own man among conservatives			0
he 's not following @entity224 , he 's not following chief justice ( @entity227 ) @entity226			2
he 's going to do his own thing			0
and the people who might expect him to follow their lead are going to be disappointed			0
" doing his own thing doing his own thing has often meant @entity0 is a lone dissenter in cases big and small , in issues ranging from state - federal authority to executive immunity and government regulation			1
the consistency of his conservative views has earned him a quietly influential power base among his colleagues , which only recently has begun to attract public notice			0
" in several of the most important areas of constitutional law , @entity0 has emerged as an intellectual leader of the @entity11 , " said @entity116 in a 2011 " @entity244 " essay			1
" since the arrival of chief justice @entity226 in 2005 , and justice @entity250 in 2006 , the court has moved to the right when it comes to the free - speech rights of corporations , the rights of gun owners , and potentially , the powers of the federal government ; in each of these areas , the majority has followed where @entity0 been leading for a decade or more			1
rarely has a @entity11 justice enjoyed such broad or significant vindication			1
" but anger and disappointment remain among many in the @entity10 - @entity10 community			0
" it is severely disturbing			0
i wo n't call it disappointing , because i did n't expect anything different from @entity0 , " said @entity268 , a @entity117 political commentator and @entity270 professor , about these latest remarks			1
" he suggested race does n't matter , that race should n't matter or be a factor in any decision - making process			2
this ignores reality of race that persists today			0
" despite the public focus on skin color during his comments in @entity16 , @entity0 ' broader message was one of faith and public service , topics he feels far more comfortable addressing in such forums			1
as one of six catholics on the bench , @entity0 noted his religious upbringing helps in the role as a judge , where he is " in the right place to do hard things			1
" " i quite frankly do n't know how you do these hard jobs without some faith , " he concluded .			2
