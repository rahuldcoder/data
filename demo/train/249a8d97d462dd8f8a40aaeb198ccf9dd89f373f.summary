founded on the heels of @entity3 's civil rights movement , the @entity0 burnished its name with legal wins over white - supremist groups and helped integrate institutions like the @entity8			1
but it has also stoked anger with the @entity10 , a conservative @entity11 policy group that lashed out this week after a 28 - year - old gunman stormed their downtown @entity14 headquarters and opened fire			1
" let me be clear that @entity18 was responsible for firing the shot yesterday , " said council president @entity17			0
" but @entity18 was given a license to shoot an unarmed man by organizations like the @entity0 that have been reckless in labeling organizations hate groups because they disagree with them on public policy			1
" shooting sparks controversy over ' hate ' designation the @entity0 has listed @entity31 as a hate group since 2010 , pointing to what it describes as its anti-gay propaganda and legislative agenda			1
in 1999 , an @entity10 analyst co-authored a document titled " @entity38 to @entity39 , " according to the law center			1
the booklet , which is not available on the @entity10 website , reportedly argued that " the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the ' prophets ' of a new sexual order , " according to the @entity0			1
the group opposes same - sex marriage and lobbied to prevent the repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , which prohibited military service by openly gay men and women			0
@entity17 said the @entity0 " should be held accountable for their reckless use of terminology that is leading to the intimidation and what the @entity60 here has categorized as an act of domestic terrorism			2
" the gunman apparently said , " i do n't like your politics " during the incident , and had been carrying 15 @entity70 sandwiches , a possible connection to the restaurant chain 's ceo and his stance against gay marriage			0
accusations fly after @entity14 shooting @entity18 , a former @entity78 student , had reportedly worked as a volunteer at an organization serving the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender communities			0
he allegedly shot a security guard on wednesday at the building before being wrestled to the ground			0
but soon after @entity17 ' comments , the @entity0 defended its classification of the council			2
" @entity17 ' accusation is outrageous , " said @entity90 , a @entity0 senior fellow			1
" the @entity10 and its allies on the religious right are saying , in effect , that offering legitimate and fact - based criticism in a democratic society is tantamount to suggesting that the objects of criticism should be the targets of criminal violence			2
" conservatives : shooting is evidence of war on religion while the @entity0 says it distinguishes groups that spread hateful information from violent ones , its final tally , according to @entity110 , a @entity0 spokesman , largely depends on the answer to a single question : does a group promote hate ? " it 's not an estimate of criminality , " @entity110 said			1
" some are violent and some are n't			0
" earlier this month , the @entity120 - based @entity0 came under scrutiny after it announced that it had monitored @entity122 , a 40 - year - old gunman and former front - man for a white supremacist rock band			1
@entity122 killed himself in a suburban @entity126 parking lot on august 5 after fatally shooting six people in a @entity129 temple , less than two weeks after a deadly shooting at a movieplex in @entity132 , @entity133			0
suspect charged in @entity10 shooting " there are thousands of guys like that , " said @entity110			2
" unless we get some information that he 's planning an attack , we do n't usually call law enforcement			0
" the group instead monitors and publishes material about extremist groups , and offers police training , ranging from how to interpret tattoos to what officers should be aware of during traffic stops			0
@entity150 across the @entity0 's online map is a hive of red numbers that reveals the nation 's " hate groups			1
" information on skinheads , neo-nazis and @entity160 members comprise the thousand - plus organizations suspected of spreading hate			2
each name is accompanied by a symbol , with characters ranging from a crescent moon , signifying @entity167 , to a fist , which points to white nationalism			0
the privately funded @entity0 says it is nonpartisan , funded by member donations and a $ 223 million endowment			0
but it has been criticized by groups on the right for leaning left			0
it was incorporated in 1971 , with civil rights activist @entity174 named as its first president .			1
