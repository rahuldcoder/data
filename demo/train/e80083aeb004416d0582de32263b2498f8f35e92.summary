-- this year is the 150th anniversary of one of the greatest and least remembered political media hoaxes in @entity5 history , one with startling parallels to 21st century politics and the internet age			1
it involved @entity10 , covert governmental programs for interracial sex , pro-slavery politicians and scheming newspaper editors			1
on februrary 17 , 1864 , a shocking scandal erupted early in @entity10 's re-election campaign : " proof " that @entity10 had a secret plan to solve @entity5 's " race problem " with a campaign of interracial sexual relations that would create a new " @entity5 race			1
" this was the bombshell that pro-slavery @entity26 rep. @entity25 claimed to have uncovered			2
his evidence was a pamphlet titled " @entity29 : a theory of the @entity41 and @entity42 , " whose anonymous author urged @entity32 -- then the abolitionist party -- to openly confess their desire for race mixing by adding it to their official political platform for the upcoming presidential election			1
speaking before @entity46 , @entity25 brandished letters of support the pamphleteer received from a handful of abolitionist newspaper editors , which @entity25 claimed proved the pamphlet 's " disgusting theories , " which " seem so novel to us , have been a part of the gospel of abolition for years			1
" foreshadowing the fictitious " death panels " with which today 's @entity32 recently tried to kill @entity57 's health care proposals , @entity25 's conjured apocalyptic visions of a " department for the hybrids " empowered to achieve miscegenation 's " practical realization by a bureau , " indicting the @entity64 recently established to aid the formerly enslaved			1
the ensuing controversy dogged @entity10 for the remainder of the election campaign , and " miscegenation , " this new word for race mixing coined by the pamphleteer , was widely adopted in place of " amalgamation , " its predecessor			1
the hot - button issue of race mixing could now no longer be discussed without invoking @entity10 's supposed enthusiasm for this cultural taboo			1
the president 's re-election hopes had been dim enough with the war dragging on with no end in sight , and this new trumped up scandal did n't help matters			2
@entity10 's political enemies in the @entity86 could n't have been more pleased with the scandal if they 'd designed it themselves			1
in fact , one of them had done just that			0
the " @entity29 " pamphlet was a forgery , and the entire scandal an artfully managed hoax			1
it was the work of @entity99 @entity98 , managing editor of @entity101 , the leading @entity103 - aligned , pro-slavery newspaper in the @entity86 , and @entity104 , one of his reporters			1
@entity107 's first brilliant move was crafting an amalgamation scandal without saying " amalgamation , " replacing a word that set abolitionists immediately on guard with the innocuously unfamiliar " miscegenation			1
" the word miscegenation 's derivation -- from misc - ( " mixed " ) and genus ( " species " ) -- awaited only the endorsement of @entity10 's allies to , @entity98 hoped , ignite the powder keg of @entity123 racism			1
@entity98 shrewdly presented his poison pill as a pamphlet , a favorite format of anti-slavery writers			0
pamphlets were essentially the blogs of their day			0
made cheap and easy to produce by technological improvements , pamphlets had democratized access to the tools of mass communication , spreading the views of radicals , cranks , hucksters and crusaders			0
once a handful of gullible abolitionists replied to the copies of " @entity29 " that @entity98 had mailed them , the hoaxer promptly delivered the material to @entity25 and sat back and watched			0
thanks to a news cycle sped - up by new technology -- everything from telegraphs and railroads to shorthand and printing innovations -- the newspaper editor knew the story would be burning itself and the new word that embodied it into the national consciousness before the @entity10 administration knew what was happening			1
the @entity159 , signed the previous year , was dubbed the " @entity160 , " and the new word was a staple of political rhetoric throughout the campaign , including cartoons like " @entity29 , or the millennium of @entity167 , " which depicted @entity10 and leading @entity32 and abolitionists courting black women			1
like the claims that president @entity57 is a secret @entity169 -- a @entity171 poll in 2012 found nearly one out of five @entity172 believe this -- the miscegenation story proved immune to debunking			0
not everyone believed , perhaps not even most , but the story would not die			0
eager to keep the story alive , @entity98 refrained from mentioning miscegenation in his own newspaper for weeks , knowing that any association with @entity101 would bring greater skepticism			0
he also seems to have spread rumors attributing the pamphlet to this or that abolitionist			1
@entity98 went to sometimes comical lengths to keep the miscegenation story alive			0
a week after @entity188 , one of the abolitionists who inspired the hoax , expressed doubt that the pamphlet 's author " was in earnest , " @entity98 wrote to him pretending to be the author			1
@entity197 in turn told his readers that " the author of ' @entity29 ' has written to assure us of the perfect sincerity in which he presented his views to the public			0
" @entity98 and @entity104 even narrowly avoided arrest when their offices were stormed by @entity208 soldiers searching for a different newspaper hoaxer			0
when late - summer @entity211 victories suddenly rescued @entity10 's re-election hopes , @entity98 sent a copy of the pamphlet to @entity10 himself			1
" i am aware , " he wrote to @entity10 , " that the subject creates prejudice among depraved and ignoble minds , but i am sure that you ... see no other solution of the @entity42			2
may i ask your permission to dedicate it to your excellency ? " @entity10 , rather busy at the time and no fool , never responded			2
although the @entity227 kept quiet on the subject , @entity32 congressmen and abolitionists rebutted the charges			0
some thought them fake and some thought they were " friendly fire " from a well - meaning anti-slavery crackpot			0
for the record , @entity10 equivocated on the subject of racially mixed marriage			2
but he is also recorded as saying : " if a white man wants to marry a @entity42 woman , let him do it , if the @entity42 woman can stand it			0
" word that miscegenation had been a hoax got out after @entity10 's re-election , but the hoaxers maintained their anonymity			1
their identities only emerged after their deaths , and the story of the @entity251 faded into obscurity			0
the word " miscegenation , " however , did not			2
with its hoax origin forgotten , " miscegenation 's " scientific connotation -- and the fact that it has the same prefix as " mistake " or " misbegotten " -- planted the notion that races represented different species that should be separated			1
when the hopeful progress of the reconstruction period was ended , thanks to white @entity265 aggression and @entity123 white apathy , the ideology of " anti-miscegenation " became the foundational justification for the @entity273 segregation that followed			0
under @entity273 , racial status replaced slave status as the primary basis for the continued oppression and exploitation of @entity172			0
state " anti-miscegenation laws " barring interracial marriage policed the boundaries of white privilege , and their language is suffused with pseudo-scientific rationales that the word " miscegenation " embodied			2
behind the anti-miscegenation laws stood the extra-legal threat of lynch law and the @entity289			0
these laws remained on the books in the former @entity293 states until declared unconstitutional in 1969 's @entity295 decision , which invalidated laws banning interracial marriage			0
inverting @entity299 's famous formulation , " miscegenation " started as farce and ended as tragedy			2
we would do well to take more seriously the possible dangers of our rather similar political and media culture in which lies and dangerous memes on the @entity308 are both ephemeral and eternal			2
it matters what we call things			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity314 .			2

@entity314 : it 's the 150th anniversary of a huge political hoax in @entity5
news spread of @entity10 's plan to " blend the races " to create a new " @entity5 race "
@entity314 : evidence was a pamphlet , the blog of its day , written by pro-slavery editor
@entity314 : @entity329 put the made - up word " miscegenation " in the culture , and it exists to this day
