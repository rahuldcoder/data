@entity0 -- for several fear - filled minutes last friday , three passengers on board @entity3 flight 2332 in @entity5 called emergency dispatchers to report a flight attendant 's apparent meltdown , asking for help and trying to make sense of her strange rant			1
the flight , which was on the ground , never took off , and no passengers were hurt			2
but the 911 calls , released tuesday , show the mutual confusion of the callers and the 911 dispatchers as they tried to piece together information , which was sparse on both sides of the phone line			2
" we 're on flight 2332 and , um , they 're talking over the radio about crashing our plane , " the first caller , a woman , told the emergency dispatcher			1
" ok , who is talking about crashing your plane ? " the dispatcher asked			1
" the attendants , over the @entity36 , " the caller said			2
" obviously perplexed , and wanting to confirm the bizarre report , the dispatcher repeated the information			0
" you 're currently on board the flight , and the attendants are announcing over the @entity44 ... " " yes , " the caller interjected			1
" ... that they 're going to crash the plane ? " the dispatcher asked			1
" yes , " the caller said			2
" did they say why ? " " no , " the caller answered			2
the dispatcher implored the caller not to hang up , asked for her name and phone number , and asked precisely what the flight attendant said			1
" her specific words were , ' this plane is not going to take off before it crashes , ' " the passenger said			2
a second female passenger called , and the dispatcher told her help was on the way			2
" listen , we 've got people that are coming to you			0
i need you to give me some information so you can help me fill them in , ok ? " the dispatcher said			0
" ( you are ) going to be ok			0
as long as that plane does n't take off , you are still fine			2
you are still on the ground , right ? " the passenger confirmed the plane was still on the ground and said a passenger in the back of the plane had just gone up front			0
" ok , do n't be alarmed			0
he may be a sky marshal , " the dispatcher said			0
" they fly armed and they are in plainclothes			0
so do n't be alarmed			0
" the man , it was later learned , was another passenger who helped detain the flight attendant			1
the third 911 caller , a man , asked " are you all aware of what 's going on on flight 2332 right now ? " " it looks like they 're physically restraining a flight attendant , " he said			1
" she 's lost it			0
" finally , another call came from the airport control tower , saying the matter was nearing a resolution			0
" @entity102 returning to the gate			0
fight being reported , " the control tower official reported			0
friday morning 's event at @entity107 was a rare disruption blamed on a flight attendant , but did not appear to involve any criminal intent			1
local and federal officials said they had not filed charges against the airline employee , adding to speculation she had suffered a mental breakdown			1
one passenger later told @entity1 the flight attendant appeared confused even before the flight pulled away from the gate			1
the passenger said she overheard the flight attendant say she was bipolar and had not taken her medication			1
as the plane taxied towards the runway , the flight attendant made references to needing to perform " cross-checks , " and then appeared to be attempting to reach the pilots			1
unable to reach the pilots , she announced on the plane 's public address system that she was no longer responsible for the safety of the aircraft and that it might crash			0
fellow crew members scuffled with the woman for control of the microphone , and passengers moved in to restrain her			0
the flight attendant and a colleague were taken to a hospital for treatment , @entity3 said .			1
