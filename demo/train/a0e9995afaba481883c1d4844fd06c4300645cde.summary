@entity0 -- @entity3 's anti-missile system , the @entity4 , will become operational within four months , the @entity3 @entity2 said monday			1
the security system -- which was designed to protect @entity3 from short - range missiles and rockets -- is part of a larger defense system that includes protection from mid- and long - range missiles , intended to protect @entity3 from a possible @entity14 attack , the ministry said in a statement monday			1
video released by the ministry shows the interception of @entity20 and @entity21 - like rockets , similar to those launched into @entity3 from @entity23 in recent years and from @entity24 during the second @entity24 war of 2006			1
@entity3 has considered rockets and missiles the main threat to its security since it withdrew its troops from southern @entity24 in 2000 and from @entity23 in 2005			1
" this is an important landmark for the security system and the security industries , " defense minister @entity31 said in a written statement			0
" we will work to station the systems on the ground as soon as possible			0
" " the importance of the new system is major , " concurred @entity39 , national security and defense commentator for @entity43 newspaper and its website , known as @entity45			1
" the @entity48 can easily identify and target heavy missiles before being launched because of the time required to prepare them , whereas short - range rockets can easily be hidden behind any bush or house in southern @entity24 , " he said			1
" it is the lighter -- up to 70 kilometers range -- rockets that pose the serious nuisance to the @entity3 population			2
" in @entity62 , the @entity61 is asking @entity63 to approve $ 205 million to help @entity3 build the system , @entity60 administration officials said			2
@entity61 spokesman @entity65 explained the administration 's rationale , saying , " the president recognizes the threat missiles and rockets fired by @entity71 and @entity72 pose to @entity3			2
" according to an @entity3 defense ministry spokesman , the cost of developing and manufacturing the first two batteries was approximately $ 218 million			1
the cost of each additional battery is estimated at $ 13 million and rises to $ 21 million with the addition of radars and missiles			0
" a good coverage of @entity3 's borders requires 15 to 20 batteries , " @entity39 said			2
he said he believes the advantages of the system justify the cost			0
" each intercepting missile costs the @entity48 $ 50,000 , yet the price should not be compared to the cost of the cheap @entity21 but rather to the cost of the damages it causes both in human lives and in property			0
when examined this way , ( the ) equation is clear			0
" the funds proposed by the @entity61 are expected to pay for up to nine more @entity4 batteries			0
two senior administration officials said the $ 205 million would be in addition to the $ 3 billion the @entity101 spends each year to support @entity3 's defense			0
one senior administration official said a @entity101 team traveled last fall to @entity3 to see work on @entity4 , and concluded that it was " a system that made sense			1
" another senior administration official said the funding is part of an ongoing partnership between the @entity101 and @entity3 to promote steps " we can jointly take to improve @entity3 's security			0
" @entity3 's short - range rocket - defense system is " one of the security measures we 've been talking ( about ) with them over time , " the official added			1
the @entity60 administration is helping @entity3 enhance its security systems , in part , to address @entity3 fears that the establishment of a @entity125 state would create a safe launching pad for rocket attacks			0
the batteries " can be transferred anywhere within @entity3 within a matter of hours , " the defense ministry said .			2

new : " the importance of the new system is major , " said @entity45 commentator
new : the batteries are portable
the @entity3 defense system is known as the @entity4
it is designed to protect against short - range missiles and rockets
