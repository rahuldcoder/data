@entity1 's family waited months for hundreds of hours of surveillance video , hoping it would answer their questions			1
rather than showing how their 17 - year - old son 's body ended up in a school gym mat in january , the four cameras inside the @entity10 , @entity11 , gymnasium showed only a few collective seconds of @entity1 , jogging			1
the camera fixed on the gym mats was blurry			0
compounding the family 's suspicions was the nature of the gym videos			1
they 're jumpy , with students intermittently appearing and vanishing , and they bear no obvious timestamps			0
the @entity27 ' attorneys were not shy in stating their suspicion that someone could have tampered with the videos			2
" they know their child did not climb into a wrestling mat , get stuck and die			0
where is that video ? " @entity35 asked			2
attorney @entity36 questioned why time codes were n't shown in the videos			2
" we do n't have any time code with which to synchronize the events that are shown in the video			0
... either the cameras did this on their own or a human being interacted to make these cameras do these things , " @entity36 said			0
@entity35 further said the family believes someone " corrupted " the video			1
@entity51 insists the video is " a raw feed with no edits , " and the @entity55 , which asserts @entity1 accidentally died while reaching for a shoe in one of the mats , says it did n't edit any files , according to their lawyers			1
@entity61 , which filed suit to secure access to the video , hired forensic video analyst @entity65 to analyze more than 290 hours of material from all 35 cameras inside and outside of the gym			1
@entity65 is a @entity70 @entity69 consultant and contract instructor for the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74			0
@entity61 also provided @entity65 and his company , the @entity76 , @entity78 - based @entity77 , with hundreds more hours of video from 31 cameras in other parts of @entity82			1
@entity65 quickly knocked down the @entity84 ' concerns -- they 're all easily explained , he said -- but his examination raised what could be another mystery : at least an hour of missing video from all four cameras inside the gym			1
" those files are not original files , " @entity65 said			0
" they 're not something investigators should rely on for the truth of the video			0
" addressing the @entity84 ' suspicions , @entity65 said the erratic motion in the video can be attributed to motion sensors triggering the cameras ' recording function , and the blurriness on the camera homing in on the gym mats is the product of an out - of - focus lens			1
as for the time stamp , it 's there ; investigators just need to know where to look , he said			0
coroner slams handling of @entity1 case @entity65 was able to find a little more than 18 minutes of video showing @entity1 throughout the school on january 10			1
he 's first seen at 7:31 a.m. entering school and last seen at 1:09 p.m. , walking into the gym where he was found dead the next day			2
what @entity65 was n't able to find was video showing whether there was anyone in the gym when @entity1 was there -- images that could prove vital in determining how the teen died			1
" ( the surveillance video has ) been altered in a number of ways , primarily in image quality and likely in dropped information , information loss , " he said			2
" there are also a number of files that are corrupted because they 've not been processed correctly and they 're not playable			0
i ca n't say why they were done that way , but they were not done correctly , and they were not done thoroughly			0
so we 're missing information			0
" two cameras in the gym are missing an hour and five minutes , their hiatus ending at 1:09 , when @entity1 enters the gym			1
another pair of cameras are missing two hours and 10 minutes each			2
they do n't begin recording again until 1:15 and 1:16 , according to their time stamps			0
what 's certain , based on video from a camera outside the gym , is that numerous students walked into the gym during the hour and five minutes that the cameras were n't recording , but it 's not clear whether that was sufficient to activate the cameras ' motion sensors			1
the time stamp on a camera outside the gym also appears to be 10 minutes behind the cameras inside the gym			0
" i ca n't tell you whether there was no information recorded in the digital video system or whether somebody made an error and did n't capture it or whether somebody just did n't provide it , " @entity65 said			0
@entity61 has requested access to the original surveillance servers			0
but @entity65 cautions that the video could be gone , as newer surveillance would replace it if it was n't recovered promptly from the school 's digital video recorder			1
the police have said they did n't receive a copy of the videos until several days after @entity1 's body was found , according to an unredacted report obtained by @entity61 after a legal process			1
@entity65 told @entity61 he found it " highly suspicious " that an hour of video could be missing , especially considering how the material was acquired by police			1
" the investigator 's responsibility is to acquire the entire digital video recording system and have their staff define what they want to obtain , " he said			2
according to an incident report from the @entity55 , however , a detective watched a portion of the video then asked an information technology officer employed by the school board to produce a " copy of the surveillance video for the entire wing of the school with the old gym for the last 48 hours			1
" five days later , the sheriff 's report says , the it officer delivered a hard drive to the detective , who verified it contained what he requested			0
" right now , what they 've done , is they 've left it up to the school district as to what it is they want to provide to the police , and i think that probably is a mistake , " @entity65 said			2
" you do n't want somebody who might be party to the responsibility to make the decision as to what they provide the police			0
" he added , " until i have the digital video system in my hand and i can say , or an investigator can say , ' everything is intact , and this is what was recorded , ' i would still be highly suspicious of this			0
" the @entity1 family will now have to wait to see whether the school 's surveillance servers shed more light on their son 's death , but the teen 's parents say they wo n't be deterred			1
" we are @entity1 , " his mother , @entity248 , said			2
" that 's my child , and we 're going to fight until it 's all over , until we get the truth			0
that 's all we 've ever asked for -- was the truth about what happened to @entity1			1
" the start of the story : a family demands answers			2

surveillance from high school where @entity1 died raises questions
however , it answers three of the @entity1 family 's suspicions about the case
forensic expert finds more than an hour of video missing from four cameras
