-- a twister filled with man - eating sharks is about to hit @entity3 -- at least on your television screen			2
" @entity6 : the @entity12 " debuts wednesday on the @entity8 network , and many fans are anxious to see if it has teeth			1
it 's the sequel to 2013 's tv movie - turned - pop cultural phenomenon " @entity6 , " which set social media afire			1
there are high expectations for it , even if one of the stars thinks the name is less than inspired			2
" ' @entity6 , ' really guys ? " asked @entity23 , who joins the franchise as the best friend of protagonist @entity26			1
" you guys have a lunch break when you were making up the title ? " last summer , " @entity6 " churned up a storm of laughs and 5.3 million viewers over the course of three airings on @entity8			1
audiences got creative , with a-listers live - tweeting and shark memes circling the @entity40			2
@entity41 and @entity42 return in the sequel to take on the freak weather system and save the @entity45			1
@entity26 entered into the halls of outrageous pop culture with a climactic scene in which his character , @entity49 , makes a grand escape from the inside of a shark 's belly by employing a chain saw			1
fans hope " @entity56 " will be just as outlandish			2
" the whole thing is over the top			2
we have gone bigger and better in all regards , ' " said @entity59 , the screenwriter for both films			1
" expect to see the shark mayhem move to @entity3 , and by definition anything that happens in @entity3 tends to be bigger and better			2
" facing pressure from producers to replicate that iconic , gory scene with @entity26 , @entity59 said he believes he has devised the perfect solution			2
" i was 10 pages into script before that moment came to me , " @entity59 said			2
" i e-mailed the director , told him that 's what i wanted to do , and he loved it			1
and i said , ' ok , do n't tell anyone			2
' i wanted everyone else to read it as it naturally developed in the script			0
so for a month or so i had producers and directors breathing down my neck wanting to know what this moment will be , but i fended them off until i sent off the script			0
and luckily they loved it			0
i think the audience will like it , too			0
" of course , you will have to watch to find out about the grisly scene			0
bringing such outrageous episodes to life in the heart of @entity3 had its own challenges , including filming for hours in the cold of a bitter winter ( disguised as summer for the movie ) , paparazzi lurking behind taxis , and , literally , rubber sharks flying through the air			1
while filming a busy scene , @entity23 found himself standing on top of a taxicab , ready to swing himself into the shark - infested cyclone			0
" they go , ' all right @entity23 , grab onto the rope and swing across @entity110 50 feet , and jump off on the other side , ' " @entity23 said			0
" i 'm like ' it 's a string , how is anybody going to buy that ? ' and so we were doing it and jumping onto a mat like 2 feet off the ground			1
oh boy , the sharknado looks great			0
... these guys do amazing work in ( post-production )			0
" the " @entity6 " tv movies are not the first or last to take on the topic of vicious sharks attacking vulnerable humans ( although , they are perhaps the first to have sharks soaring overhead in a tornado )			1
the movies pay tribute to some of their predecessors while also trying to bring something new to the screen			0
of course , the concept of an out - of - control " @entity6 " descending on the country 's biggest cities is completely original , invented by director @entity139			1
at least one star has said she thinks it 's not beyond reality			1
@entity42 recently told @entity143 she believes a sharknado is possible			0
" you know , it actually can happen , " she said			0
" i mean , the chances of it happening are very rare , but it can happen actually			0
not that it -- the chances of it are , like , you know , it 's like probably ' pigs could fly			2
' like , i do n't think pigs could fly , but actually sharks could be stuck in tornados			0
there could be a sharknado			0
" @entity8 has already signed on for a third " @entity6 " movie			1
screenwriter @entity59 predicts that after @entity3 goes down , there might be a " global @entity164			1
" @entity59 has a few tips for the fans gearing up for " @entity6 's " big touchdown			1
" you definitely have to watch it with friends , " he said			0
" i think alcohol would probably be a good ingredient			0
you need popcorn , to eat it and also throw at tv			0
and those inflatable air sharks floating around your house would be a great addition			0
" " @entity6 : the @entity12 " premieres at 9 p.m. et wednesday on @entity8			1
