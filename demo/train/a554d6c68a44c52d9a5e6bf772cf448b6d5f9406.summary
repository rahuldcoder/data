@entity0 -- since the revelation on the front page of daily newspaper @entity10 , on december 11 , with a particularly vicious editorial talking about @entity7 's national treasure as a " former genius actor , " @entity3 's departure to @entity4 , where he bought a property just a mile from the @entity7 border , has deeply divided and saddened @entity7			1
even more so since , as we have learnt this week , @entity15 president @entity14 has bestowed the actor @entity15 citizenship			1
read more : @entity3 's puzzling love for @entity15 back in mid-december , the @entity7 media operated along political lines : the left - wing press such as @entity10 could n't find strong enough words to describe @entity3 's " desertion " while right - wing publications such as @entity26 , slightly uneasy at the news , preferred to focus on president @entity29 's punishing taxes which allegedly drove throngs of millionaires to seek tax asylum in more fiscally lenient countries such as @entity4 or @entity34			1
@entity26 stopped short of passing moral judgement though			0
others like satirical weekly @entity37 , preferred irony			0
its cover featured a cartoon of the rather rotund - looking @entity3 in front of a @entity4 flag with the headline : " can @entity4 take the world 's entire load of cholesterol ? " ouch			0
quickly though , it became quite clear that @entity3 was not treated in the same way as other famous @entity7 tax exiles			2
@entity7 actor @entity52 is a @entity53 resident as is crooner - rocker @entity54 , and many other @entity7 stars and sportsmen ensure they reside for under six months in @entity7 in order to escape being taxed here on their income and capital			2
their move has hardly ever been commented on			0
and they certainly never had to suffer the same infamy			0

it started with the @entity7 prime minister @entity69 , and many members of his government , showing their disdain , and talking of @entity3 's " pathetic move			1
" in response the outraged actor penned an open letter to the @entity7 pm in which he threatened to give back his @entity7 passport			2
the backlash was not over			0
fellow thespian @entity79 fired the first salvo against @entity3 in an open letter published in @entity10 , insulting both @entity3 's protruding physique and lack of patriotism : " so you 're leaving the ship @entity7 in the middle of a storm ? what did you expect , @entity90 ? you thought we would approve ? you expected a medal , an academy award from the economy ministry ? (...) we 'll get by without you			2
" @entity7 actress @entity95 felt she had to step in to defend @entity3			2
in another open letter published by @entity10 , she evoked the darkest hours of the @entity7 revolution			0
before flying to @entity98 to celebrate the @entity99 , @entity3 gave an interview to @entity101 in which he seemed to be joking about having asked @entity14 for @entity15 citizenship			1
except , it was n't a joke			0
read more : @entity7 star @entity3 ditches @entity7 for @entity14 's @entity15 in truth , @entity7 people have felt touched to their core by @entity3 's gesture			1
he , more than anyone , represents the @entity111 spirit			1
he has been @entity112 , he has been @entity113 ; he , better than most , on screen and off , stands for what it means to be @entity7 : passionate , sensitive , theatrical , and grandiose			0
ambiguous too , and weak in front of temptations and pleasures			0
for more than two weeks now , # @entity3 has been trending on @entity7 @entity120			2
surveys have showed @entity7 's dilemma : half the @entity7 people understand him but there are as many who think that paying one 's taxes is a national duty			1
in other words , a majority of @entity7 people disapprove of his action but ca n't help loving the man			1
read more : @entity0 promises flurry of economic reforms @entity14 's move in granting the actor @entity15 citizenship has exacerbated things			1
and first of all , it is a blow to @entity29 who , it was revealed , had a phone conversation with @entity3 on @entity143			0
the @entity144 refused to communicate on the men 's exchange			0
a friend of the actor declared that @entity3 complained about being so reviled by the press and that he was leaving , no matter what			0
if , in their hearts , the @entity7 do n't quite believe @entity3 might one day settle in @entity153 and abandon them , they feel deeply saddened by the whole saga			2
however , with @entity7 's former sex symbol @entity157 declaring that she too might ask @entity14 for @entity15 citizenship to protest against the fate of zoo elephants in @entity162 , it looks as if the @entity7 may prefer to laugh the whole thing off			1
proof of this : the last trend on @entity7 @entity120 is # @entity167			0

majority of @entity7 people disapprove of his action but ca n't help loving him , she adds
