-- this week , @entity1 were confronted -- yet again -- with more of the same refusal by president @entity3 to take on the greatest long - term threat to our economic and health care security			1
consistent with his track record , the president 's annual budget proposal offers no credible reforms for our entitlement programs that will ensure their solvency in the years to come			1
instead , his budget reflects the same disregard he demonstrated last month , in his 7,000 - word @entity19 address , in which only 40 words were used to talk about @entity21 and @entity22			1
the fact is @entity21 and @entity22 , vital to the welfare of tens of millions of @entity1 , account for nearly half of all federal spending			1
that percentage will continue to increase in the coming years			0
left on its current trajectory , overall entitlement spending is projected to more than double by 2049 , thus consuming 100 % of all tax revenue			0
it should be no surprise that the payroll tax - supported trust funds that pay out @entity21 and @entity22 benefits are speeding toward a financial collapse			1
the @entity38 projects that @entity22 in its current form will be bankrupt by 2022			0
@entity21 's chief actuary calculates that a 23 % cut in benefits in 2036 will be required in order to maintain solvency of the @entity45			2
of the two programs , @entity21 can be shored up for nearly a generation with simple modest reforms			2
@entity22 reform is far more complicated			2
however , if @entity52 passes a bipartisan @entity21 reform , then the momentum of that accomplishment can prompt leaders of both parties to tackle @entity22 reform			1
last year , i introduced the @entity57 , which would ensure that @entity21 is solvent for the next 75 years , through very gradual yearly increases of only three months per year in the retirement age and a modest adjustment to the annual cost - of - living increases			0
it would keep core benefits untouched and requires no new taxes			0
enacting such modest , incremental changes would avoid bankrupting the trust fund and forcing a 23 % cut in core benefits in 2036			0
as with @entity21 , much - needed changes to @entity22 would require open debate			1
several promising proposals for reforming @entity22 have been brought forward in @entity52			1
i applaud those of my colleagues of both parties who are working to find responsible solutions to this important issue			0
senators @entity78 and @entity80 have proposed a plan that would : ( a ) adjust the @entity22 eligibility age to reflect gains in life expectancy ; ( b ) cap out - of - pocket costs to protect recipients from bankruptcy in the event of a major illness ; and ( c ) require wealthier beneficiaries to pay higher premiums			0
another proposal , coming from rep. @entity94 and sen. @entity95 , offers seniors a choice among @entity22 - approved private plans , which would compete alongside a traditional @entity22 plan			0
the fact is @entity22 as we know it may not exist in coming years if @entity52 does not take steps now to preserve the program			2
every year we do nothing makes the inevitable task of structural reform all the more difficult			0
constructive dialogue and timely reforms are required to assure health care security for millions of current and future retirees			1
in recent years , critics of the various entitlement reform proposals have claimed that many of the proposed changes will " kill " @entity21 and @entity22			1
but , in fact , as the numbers show , the status quo will kill these programs			0
criticizing serious attempts at entitlement reform without offering alternatives to the status quo is the least compassionate and least responsible option for @entity1			2
entitlement reform can not wait			2
just as @entity21 and @entity22 programs were enacted with broad bipartisan support , securing and saving these programs will require nothing short of both parties of @entity52 working together			1
ultimately , it will hinge in large part on president @entity3 's level of courage to confront this pressing issue			1
follow @entity135 on @entity136 join the conversation on @entity138 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			0

sen. @entity141 says entitlement reform is critical to our health care security
she says @entity21 and @entity22 funds will head toward bankruptcy if action is not taken
@entity141 : it 's time for president @entity3 to focus on reforming these programs
she says @entity52 should also step up to find a bipartisan solution
