the regents unanimously voted to re-examine how the university handled the accusation during a special meeting on the @entity3 campus tuesday			1
the mother of a woman who reported she had been raped in a @entity30 dorm room in october 2007 sent letters in november and may to school officials complaining about the school 's handling of the case			1
those letters -- which president @entity14 received copies of -- were n't turned over to the regents during the initial investigation , which concluded in june			1
in that investigation , the regents concluded that university officials had handled the situation correctly			1
now that the regents are aware of the letters , however , they want to know more			1
" this is a serious breach of trust , " @entity45 president @entity44 said			2
" it undermines the credibility of the university and this board			1
" school officials say they welcome the second investigation , insisting that the findings will be the same as the earlier probe			1
the new report will be presented at the next regents ' meeting , scheduled for september 18			0
on july 18 , one of the letters from the mother was released			1
in the four - page letter , which @entity44 described as heart - wrenching , the mother contended that the university had mishandled her daughter 's case			1
@entity3 officials have not disputed the letter 's contents but insist there was no cover - up			2
in october 2007 , the woman reported she had been assaulted in a @entity30 dorm by two then - @entity77 football players , @entity78 and @entity79			1
the men left the team late last year			0
after a trip to the hospital , she and her father went to the athletics department with the allegations			2
according to the letter , she was interviewed by @entity89 , the @entity3 athletics director , head football coach @entity91 , and @entity92 , an associate athletics director			1
the woman claims that she was pressured to keep the case " informal " or within the athletics department			1

@entity78 and @entity79 were both charged with second - degree sexual abuse six months after the incident			0
@entity78 was also charged with third - degree sexual abuse			0
the first letter was dated november 19 , 2007 , and was sent to various university officials			1
@entity104 said she saw the letter around @entity107			0
another letter was sent in may directly to @entity104			0
neither letter was given to the regents , a move that put into question the manner in which the investigation was handled			2
the letter sent in may has not been released yet , @entity3 spokesman @entity115 said			0
the original reasoning for not handing over the letters , @entity104 said , was an interpretation of the @entity120			2
this act gives parents and students the right to protect their educational records			0
" this original thinking ... is just not tenable , " @entity104 said , apologizing to the regents			0
" there is no excuse for the failure to turn over those letters as part of the [ first ] investigation			1
" @entity104 was informed of the misinterpretation by @entity134 , the @entity3 vice president for @entity135 and the school 's general counsel , but who initially made the mistake was not disclosed			2
@entity104 apologized profusely for the incident to the regents and the family			0

the family declined to talk with him			0
@entity89 , who attended the meeting , said he welcomed the second investigation , and he was confident that the regents would find that his staff had followed the correct steps			1
" again , it has been very challenging to not be able to tell the full story , " @entity89 said in a statement issued after the meeting			0
" it has been especially trying the past few days as the integrity and character of @entity91 , president @entity104 , [ and myself ] has been publicly challenged			2
