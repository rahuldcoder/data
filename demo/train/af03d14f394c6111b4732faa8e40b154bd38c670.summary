@entity0 -- @entity2 put the dog out late friday and looked to the skies above his @entity6 , @entity7 , residence			2
he saw lights -- a bunch of them			0
" they almost looked like fireballs or fireflies , strobing , " @entity2 told @entity1 saturday			0
the art director , 35 , who first began looking for possible signs of a plummeting @entity18 satellite around 10 p.m. , grabbed his camera			0
he 's pretty sure the photos he submitted to @entity1 's @entity21 were pieces of the satellite , which entered the @entity24 's atmosphere around that time			1
" it was a once in a lifetime opportunity , " he said			0
@entity27 said the @entity29 's debris fell to @entity24 between 11:23 p.m. et friday and 1:09 a.m. et saturday			1
the satellite passed over @entity31 and @entity32 and likely landed off the @entity33 of the @entity18 , @entity27 said			1
" the precise re-entry time and location of debris impacts have not been determined , " @entity27 said			1
" twenty - six satellite components , weighing a total of about 1,200 pounds , could have survived the fiery re-entry and reach the surface of @entity24			1
however , @entity27 is not aware of any reports of injury or property damage			0
" @entity27 officials said it 's possible the satellite pieces hit the @entity47			1
@entity49 reported sightings of the disintegrating satellite had not proved credible because they were not near the proper track , the agency said			0
reports of suspected sightings emerged from @entity55 , where a tv photographer caught images of bright objects darting rapidly in the night sky , and from @entity60 , where @entity61 saw what he believed were two chunks from the satellite			1
@entity61 was running errands when the first flying object left a thick , white trail that lingered in the sky for about 20 minutes , he said			1
a second object followed the same path and was " massive , " he said			0
" it was like a comet , but smoke , " he said			0
" i 'm guessing it landed in the ocean , the way it was going			1
" @entity77 of @entity27 's @entity79 team in @entity80 said before the rubbish fell that there was no way to know exactly where the pieces would come down			1
" part of the problem is , the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways , and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it 's coming down even right before the re-entry , " @entity77 said			1
@entity27 said space debris the size of the satellite 's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year			2
@entity99 astrophysicist @entity98 noted that the satellite is far from being the biggest space junk to come back			0
" this is nothing like the old @entity104 scare of the ' 70s , when you had a 70 - ton space station crashing out of the sky , " @entity98 said			2
pieces of @entity104 came down in western @entity109 in 1979			2
@entity61 said he was amazed his home of @entity111 , @entity112 , seemed to be an ideal place to watch hunks of a satellite rain from the sky			2
" of all the places in the world where it could hit , here it was , in @entity112 , " he said			0
" it was quite weird			0
" @entity1 's @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0

location of debris is still not determined
a man in @entity60 says he thinks he saw pieces fall from the sky
about *26* pieces , some weighing *hundreds* of pounds , were expected to survive re-entry
it is not clear exactly where the pieces might have landed
