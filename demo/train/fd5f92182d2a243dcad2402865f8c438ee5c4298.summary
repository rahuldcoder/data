@entity0 -- @entity0 's @entity2 voted friday to strip embattled mayor @entity3 of his ability to govern in an emergency and to appoint and dismiss committee chairs -- unprecedented moves aimed at reining in the controversial politician			1
despite admitting last week that he had smoked crack cocaine in a " drunken stupor " about a year ago , @entity3 has defiantly said he will not leave his job and vowed to challenge the actions in court			2
" obviously , i ca n't support this , " @entity3 told council members , warning that the legal fight will cost taxpayers " an arm and a leg			1
" but , he added : " i perfectly understand where they 're coming from			0
... i would have supported what they 're doing			0
i want to move on			0
i 'm not mad at anybody			0
" the @entity2 meeting reflected the tragicomedic state of municipal affairs in @entity0 , where police have investigated the mayor for smoking crack cocaine and other indiscretions			1
some council members compared the move to strip @entity35 of his duties to a coup d'etat			1
councillor @entity39 said he understood the need to bring stability to the city but called friday 's action a " dangerous precedent			2
" " if you win an election for mayor , you are the mayor , " he said			0
" that is the people 's will			0
... i do n't want to use the word coup d'etat			0
that would be over the top			0
" the council chambers erupted with laughter			0
the mayor 's brother , councilor @entity55 , chastised fellow council members , saying they did n't have the " moral or legal authority " to strip an elected official of his responsibilities			1
" it 's not up to you folks to make this decision , " he said , " it 's up to the people			0
" @entity55 repeated that statement friday night on @entity1 , adding that the media had been unfair to his brother , because @entity3 represented blue - collar workers of @entity0			1
" he 's admitted to his faults , and i just wish other politicians would come clean like @entity3 has , " @entity55 told @entity73			1
he insisted that his brother did not have a drug problem			0
" i want to be very clear here			0
@entity3 does n't come to work and drink and he does n't drink every single day			2
" but he does admit that he has excess of drinking at times and he 's getting the medical support from a team of doctors and he 's also gone on a pretty steady diet and exercise program			0
so we 're confident that he 's going to move forward			0
" council actions " warranted and necessary " councillor @entity85 said the actions were being taken " reluctantly " but they " sadly are both warranted and necessary			0
" the first of two motions , approved by a 39 - 3 vote , took away @entity3 's ability to appoint and dismiss committee chairs , giving him less control over policy			1
in the past , the influential chairs followed the mayor 's orders for fear of losing their posts			1
the second motion , stripping @entity35 's power during an emergency , was approved 41 - 2 and is seen as largely symbolic since emergency response decisions are made collectively by the council			1
@entity85 said the city was fortunate @entity35 had not been impaired during a crisis			1
" @entity2 delegated those powers and council has the ability to take those powers away , " city solicitor @entity107 said at one point in the meeting			1
moments before the final vote , @entity3 said : " i would 've supported what they 're doing " if another mayor did what he did , " but since it 's me , i have to support myself			1
" the meeting friday could lead to more monday , when the council says it expects to consider a motion to delegate duties not assigned by statute to the mayor			2
if approved , the motion would strip @entity35 of most of his duties			2
among other things , the motion calls for reallocating the operating budget of the office of the mayor to the city clerk , according the council 's agenda published online			1
' today i acted on complete impulse ' while fighting for his job thursday , @entity3 added to his growing list of missteps			2
early in the day , a scrum of reporters approached @entity35 to ask him about new allegations of drunkenness , drug use and the verbal and physical abuse of aides			2
in the course of answering , he denied a female staffer 's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own , stunning reporters			1
later in the day , he backtracked			0
with his wife at his side , he went back before reporters to say he had been under " tremendous , tremendous stress " and was getting unspecified support from " a team of health care professionals			0
" but he called the latest allegations " 100 % lies			0
" " when you attack my integrity as a father and as a husband , i see red			0
today i acted on complete impulse in my remarks , " @entity3 said			2
he took no questions from reporters , who shouted sharp inquiries at him as he entered the office			0
" mayor @entity3 , why should we believe you ? why would you subject your family to this ? " one asked			1
" what 's the matter with you , mr. mayor ? " another said			2
leave of absence ? the @entity183 voted 37 - 5 on wednesday to ask @entity35 to take a leave of absence , and most members turned their backs on him when he addressed their thursday meeting			2
even @entity55 , who has been his brother 's fiercest defender , conceded on @entity1 that his brother should take a couple of weeks off , to " let things cool down a bit			1
" tv show starts monday in another development , @entity196 's @entity195 announced that the @entity3 brothers will begin hosting their own tv show on monday			1
the show , " @entity202 , " picks up where the two brothers left off on a talk radio show that ended its run last week , the network said on its website			0
a headline on that site posed the question , " @entity196 's @entity211 ? " and it quoted @entity55 saying , " @entity3 is like @entity213 or @entity214 " and " you just never know what he is going to say			1
" " mayor @entity3 seems to be in a no - holds - barred mode , " the network said			1
" there is no filter			0
there is no careful treading			0
" critics of @entity195 have described its conservatism as " @entity195 , " according to a story about its launch in 2011 by the @entity228			0
locals : why @entity3 ' has got to go ' @entity35 threatens legal action the mayor recently confessed to purchasing illegal drugs in the past two years , while he was in office			1
but he has steadfastly refused to step down , saying the voters of @entity196 's largest city should decide his fate in 2014			1
the latest allegations surfaced wednesday in more than 500 pages of court documents that police used to get a search warrant for @entity242 , @entity3 's friend and occasional driver , whom police accuse of marijuana possession and trafficking			1
@entity35 responded thursday morning by threatening legal action against former staffers who claimed the mayor brought a woman appearing to be an escort to his office and drank alcohol while driving			1
the documents include police interviews with former staff members , information obtained from surveillance crews and cameras , and even an examination of the mayor 's garbage			1
several staffers said they were asked to buy alcohol for the mayor of @entity196 's largest city			1
one incident described by a former staffer alleged that @entity35 , while driving , stopped the vehicle , guzzled some vodka , and drove on			2
the allegations have not been substantiated by investigators , and @entity35 faces no criminal charges			2
he called the allegations " outright lies			0
" on thursday , @entity3 also said the so - called " escort " was n't a prostitute , but a family friend			2
he added that such allegations " hurt my wife			0
" " it makes me sick , " he added			0
" i 've had enough			0
