-- @entity2 's @entity1 believes he can send former world number one @entity4 packing in this week 's @entity6 tournament , as a high - class field arrives in @entity8 vying for a winner 's purse of a cool $ 1.4m			1
a high - class field sees 64 of the world 's top 68 players battling it out at the @entity14 , @entity15 , with @entity4 the most successful player in the event 's history having won the title three times since its inception in 1999			1
however , despite the @entity25 's ominous tournament record , world @entity22 is relishing the prospect of taking on the former world number one on wednesday			1
the 31 - year - old told the official @entity30 website : " it 's a great opportunity for me because i think he 's beatable			0
" i need to play good			0
that 's all i can think about and that 's all i 'm going to try on wednesday , just try playing my best game and hope that he does n't play his best			0
" despite @entity4 ' slide down the rankings in recent years , he is still ranked 20th in the world , meaning @entity1 would have to cause a major upset to progress to a last 32 clash against either @entity42 or @entity45 @entity44 champion @entity43			1
" i 'm the underdog and i have nothing to lose , at the same time i do n't think he is at his best at the moment , " added @entity1			2
" i 've never played with @entity4 before and , for me , it 's a big privilege			2
if i win , fantastic			0
if i lose , well , i 've lost to one of the best players in golf 's history			2
" @entity56 @entity55 opens his defense against veteran @entity59 @entity58 , with @entity60 of @entity61 or @entity25 @entity62 awaiting the winners			1
however , the @entity64 has an outside chance of losing his world number one ranking to either compatriot @entity67 or @entity69 's @entity68 -- should one of those two players win the tournament			1
@entity67 will open his tournament against @entity74 @entity73 , with the winner facing either @entity76 or @entity77 , both of @entity61			0
@entity68 's opening match is against @entity59 @entity80 , with @entity81 of @entity82 or @entity83 awaiting the victor of that duel .			0

@entity1 believes he can beat @entity4 in @entity87
the @entity2 world @entity89 takes on @entity4 in the first round of the @entity8 tournament
sixty - four of the world 's top 68 players are in *action* in the @entity6 event at @entity15
@entity56 @entity55 could lose his @entity100 ranking if @entity67 or @entity68 wins
