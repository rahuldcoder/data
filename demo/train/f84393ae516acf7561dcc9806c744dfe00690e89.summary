-- it 's an unnerving realization : the futuristic films of your youth have become reality			1
the lasers that terrified a generation in @entity9 's @entity8 are now used in everything from @entity12 players to the operating table			0
while @entity18 's farfetched " language translator " is as simple as downloading an app to your smart phone			0
now the slick electric cars that battled against each other in 1980s sci - fi thriller " @entity22 " have leaped from the movies to our front doors			1
introducing the world 's first @entity27 motor race , an international competition where high - tech electric cars speed around some of the world 's major cities -- all without a drop of gasoline in sight			1
" these motors are something no one has ever done before -- it 's pretty science fiction , " said @entity27 ceo @entity36			1
" if you think of movies like @entity22 or @entity44 and the noise those cars make , @entity27 will sound a lot like that			1
the sound of the electric engine is quite interesting -- it 's much lower , very futuristic , a bit like a jet fighter			1
" @entity54 the future , it seems , is much closer than you think			0
from september next year these battery - powered beasts will be zipping around 10 of the biggest cities in the world , as part of a year - long competition that could revolutionize not just the sport -- but the future of transportation			1
much like traditional @entity67 racing , the competition will feature 10 teams , each with two drivers , who will go head - to - head in 60 - minute races			1
@entity73 -- one of the most polluted cities in the world -- is expected to be the first to host the radical competition showcasing green technology			1
other cities will include @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
already , major motorsport teams have signed up to the ambitious plan -- including @entity85 team @entity84 , @entity87 's @entity86 , and @entity88 -- each expected to spend between $ 5 million and $ 10 million developing their high - tech engines			2
watch this : the aerodynamics of @entity67 " we 're not trying to compete with @entity67 -- we 're positioning ourselves in a completely different way , " said @entity36			0
" @entity27 will be much more focused on new technology , " he added			2
" the lower level of sound also means we can race in the heart of major cities without the same level of disruption			0
" battery beasts as the name suggests , @entity27 is all about electric power -- and that means big battery engines			1
each battery weighs 200 kilograms , producing around 200 kilowatts of power			0
depending on the speed , an electric engine can last anywhere from a few hours to just 25 minutes			2
and if you thought they lacked the grunt of traditional engines , think again			0
these battery beasts can hit speeds of 220 kilometers per hour			1
the gas pump is also a thing of the past in the brave new world of zero - emission racing			2
once the battery is used , it can be charged again as many times as you like			0
" from the outside they look just like other racing cars , " said @entity36			2
" they 're slightly smaller with more weight towards the back where the battery is			0
" at the moment the electricity is from batteries but in the future it could run on different sources of energy			0
we 're already working on a hydrogen prototype			0
" green machines driving this new technology is n't just an era of @entity22 - like expansion			1
it 's a racing industry grappling with increased environmental concerns			0
for more than 60 years , @entity67 has raced gas - guzzling cars across a planet which is now facing not just the threat of climate change , but limited and expensive oil supplies			2
two years ago motorsport 's international governing body , the @entity152 ( @entity153 ) , announced an ambitious plan for an electric car race that would mimic the hugely popular @entity67 series			0
now as the deadline for @entity27 looms , it could have a big impact on the future of car manufacturing			1
" if you look in the past , a lot of development in the car industry has come from racing , " said @entity36			0
" the transfer of technology is potentially very big			0
" it 's important because people are not buying electric cars at the moment -- they think they 're too slow , with limited range , and ugly			1
but if you show that they can go faster , longer , you 'll change people 's minds -- they 'll be more likely to buy electric			2
" when @entity27 waves its chequered flag for the first time in september next year , it will be a momentous moment in the history of motor racing -- and a step towards the sci - fi future .			1

the future is electric -- introducing @entity27 racing
new motor racing competition features battery - powered cars
engine sounds like something from sci - fi films @entity22 and @entity44
cars can hit speeds of 220 kilometers per hour
