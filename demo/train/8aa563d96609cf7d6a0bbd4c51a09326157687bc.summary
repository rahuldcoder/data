-- @entity2 's central bank cut key lending rates for the first time in three years on tuesday in an aggressive effort to stimulate growth and boost investment at a time when the gloss is rapidly coming off @entity11 's third largest economy			1
the @entity12 cut the repo rate -- the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks -- by 50 basis points to 8 per cent			1
the more - than - expected reduction was widely welcomed by business			0
after having increased interest rates 13 times since march 2010 , the @entity12 's move reflects a shift in the bank 's policy from focusing exclusively on reining in inflation -- which at 6.89 per cent remains high -- to reviving the country 's slowing economy , which has been choked by its aggressive monetary tightening strategy			1
" the rate cut shows that the attention has now shifted towards stimulating growth , there is no doubt about that , " said @entity31 , an economist at @entity33 securities			2
" the @entity12 was worried about inflation but from the latest data we can see that it has come down and is somewhat under control			0
now that inflation 's trajectory is downward the rbi is more confident to cut rates , " he added			1
the decision announced by @entity49 , @entity2 's central bank governor , comes after @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 moved to ease liquidity , as emerging economies try to shield themselves from the @entity56 debt crisis			1
growth in the last quarter of 2011 was the slowest in nearly three years , rising 6.1 per cent in the three months to december 31 , compared to above 8 per cent a year earlier			2
meanwhile , inflation has eased persistently over the last year			0
the wholesale price index rose 6.89 per cent in march -- below 7 per cent for the third consecutive time			2
@entity2 companies welcomed the move			2
industrialists had been begging the central bank to cut rates over the last two years , as they blamed the @entity12 's aggressive monetary tightening policy for stalling investment and damaging overall growth			1
@entity69 , director of the @entity71 @entity70 , said that the move would be overwhelming welcomed by business			0
" we called for a bold move and finally we got a bold rate cut , " said mr @entity69			0
however , he cautioned that a 50 basis point rate cut would not be enough to put the @entity2 economy back on strong growth track			1
he said that the government had to push through structural reforms to ease investment			0
" the rbi has done its part now the government needs to do its part , " said mr @entity69			0
" unfortunately they [ the government ] do n't inspire much confidence at the moment			0
" economists warn that there will not be a wave of rate cuts in the following months , especially as inflation will remain a key concern for the central bank over the next three quarters .			1
