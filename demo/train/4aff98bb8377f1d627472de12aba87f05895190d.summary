-- @entity1 and @entity2 are both carrying the weight of expectation and history into sunday 's men 's singles final at @entity7			1
@entity1 snapped a 74 - year streak when he became the first @entity10 man to reach the final at the @entity12 and will want to end a 76 - year long wait for the tennis success starved nation by actually winning a men 's grand slam title			1
the legendary @entity18 claimed both @entity7 and the @entity20 titles in 1936 , but since then nothing , despite the brave efforts of @entity1 's predecessor as @entity10 number one , @entity25			1
@entity26 was the last @entity10 winner of a grand slam at @entity7 in 1977 , the year of the @entity28 of @entity29 maybe that will be an omen because 2012 marks the @entity32 of the @entity10 monarch , who made a rare visit to @entity36 to see @entity26 win all those years ago			1
wishful thinking but that sort of historic wishful thinking is unlikely to make much impression on @entity2 and even @entity1 admits he needs to play the " perfect match " to beat the @entity43 maestro			1
" he 's one of the greatest ever players			0
he 's been doing it consistently over a number of years			0
he 's very , very tough to beat here , " @entity1 told gathered reporters after his four - set semifinal win over @entity49 of @entity50			2
" it 's a great challenge , one where i 'm probably not expected to win , but one that , if i play well , i 'm capable of winning			2
the pressure that i would be feeling if it was against somebody else i guess it would be different			0
" but there will be less on me on sunday because of who he is			0
" @entity1 's clever attempt to deflect pressure and focus it on @entity2 underestimates the expectations of a sports mad country , who have filled just about every seat for every day of every event at the @entity68 later this month			2
@entity10 is likely to come to a standstill sunday afternoon as television sets are tuned into the live broadcast and in his home town of @entity73 in @entity75 special celebrations are planned			2
formidable opponent @entity1 is right though			2
@entity2 is a formidable opponent and can set a string of records if he beats the number four seed and home hope			2
it will be a record equaling seventh @entity7 title in the @entity83 , drawing level with @entity85 , who coincidentally had the same coach , @entity86 , as @entity2			1
he will extend his own record to 17 grand slam titles and victory will also take him back to the top of the world rankings , also beating another @entity85 record for successive weeks at the top of the men 's game			1
for a 30 - year - old , considered to be a waning force , it would be a remarkable performance , made possible by his four - set dismissal of the previously dominant @entity100 to reach a record eighth @entity7 final			1
" there 's a lot on the line for me			0
i 'm not denying that			0
i have a lot of pressure , as well			0
i 'm looking forward to that			0
that 's what i work hard for , " he said			0
" i 've worked extremely hard since i lost that match point against @entity100 last year at the @entity20			0
" my run has been extremely good			0
now i have a chance at world no. 1 , and at the title again all at once			0
" so it 's a big match for me			0
" missed chance @entity2 missed that chance against @entity100 in the semifinal of the @entity20 last year , losing a five - set thriller and it looked as if it might be his last with the likes of @entity124 , who made a surprising early exit at @entity7 , and @entity1 making it even more difficult to land a grand slam			1
he would be the first man since @entity128 at the @entity129 in 2003 to win one of the top four tournaments in tennis past the age of 30 and only @entity135 legend @entity136 and @entity138 @entity137 have achieved that feat at @entity7			1
@entity1 also holds an 8 - 7 career record over @entity2 , but the last time the pair met in a grand slam final , at the @entity129 in 2010 , he was given a tennis lesson by the man from @entity145			1
but with inspiration and valuable advice from a new coach , eight - time grand slam winner @entity146 , the 25 - year @entity1 may just be ready to bring some much needed cheer to a country in the grip of austerity and in the middle of one of its wettest summers on record .			1

@entity1 bidding to become first @entity10 man to win grand slam since 1936
@entity2 can claim record equaling seventh @entity7 title
@entity1 has 8 - 7 career edge over the @entity43 star
@entity2 won their last grand slam final clash in @entity135 in 2010
