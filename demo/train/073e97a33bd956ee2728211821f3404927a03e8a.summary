-- the @entity2 response to the increasing natural disaster in @entity4 is , like so much else when it comes to @entity2 relations with that country , too little and too tentative			1
@entity9 flooding now hitting @entity4 is an unfolding humanitarian crisis on the scale of its 2005 earthquake , which claimed some 75,000 lives , or the 2004 @entity16 tsunami , in which more than 200,000 people died			1
and because of the gradual nature of flooding , as opposed to the sudden impact of an earthquake , the devastation over time could overwhelm those earlier crises			0
one in nine @entity4 -- some 20 million people -- are already homeless , lacking food or medicine			2
health officials warn that a cholera epidemic is likely , with 3Â½ million children now at risk			0
despite the cataclysmic scale of this disaster , the @entity31 administration is not responding with the same direct , comprehensive and large - scale effort that the @entity36 administration undertook in response to the 2005 @entity4 earthquake and the 2004 @entity16 tsunami			1
this current approach of primarily relying on the @entity4 government and local aid groups will not work -- either in terms of meeting the scale of the crisis or swaying @entity4 public opinion toward the @entity2			1
@entity2 aid to the flood victims is a clear humanitarian imperative			2
some have argued that it is also in the national security interest of the @entity2 to win friends and stabilize the country			0
this is of particular concern since , according to my contacts in @entity4 and reports in @entity61 media , radical @entity63 groups allied to @entity64 are on the front lines in providing direct aid to the flood victims			2
@entity68 , linked to the terrorists who carried out the 2008 attack in @entity71 , @entity72 , has already reportedly established 13 relief camps , with some 2,000 members providing help			0
@entity4 , the only nuclear - armed muslim majority country , is the home base for both the @entity78 and @entity64			0
its population faces growing radicalization ; the chairman of the @entity82 , adm. @entity81 , has called it the most important country to the future of @entity63 extremism			0
the @entity2 thus far is donating $ 76 million in assistance , only a portion of which is being provided directly by the @entity2 military			0
but the $ 76 million is dwarfed by the massive humanitarian assistance -- hundreds of millions -- the @entity2 military brought directly to victims of the 2005 earthquake and the 2004 tsunami -- delivered via aircraft carriers , hospital ships and thousands of @entity2 troops			1
@entity2 military helicopters flew some 6,000 relief operations to @entity4 earthquake victims alone			1
for both the 2005 earthquake and the tsunami , the @entity2 military worked closely with local governments , but did not leave it primarily up to them to deliver the aid			1
large - scale humanitarian assistance can have a dramatic favorable influence on public opinion			0
the nonprofit organization i lead provided empirical proof of this in conducting the first public opinion surveys of @entity116 after the tsunami and @entity4 after the 2005 earthquake , as well as follow - up polls			1
after the tsunami struck @entity116 , the world 's largest @entity121 country , on december 26 , 2004 , the @entity2 led an extraordinary international relief effort of on - the - ground , people - to - people aid			1
it was broadcast nonstop on local @entity116 television and had a clear @entity2 " brand			0
" afterward , public opinion among @entity116 dramatically swung toward the @entity2 , with 65 percent of @entity116 expressing a favorable opinion as a direct result of @entity2 aid			2
@entity81 called the shift in @entity116 public opinion toward @entity2 " one of the defining moments of this new century			0
" similarly , after the devastating earthquake hit @entity4 in 2005 , the @entity2 stepped in with another intensive relief effort -- again widely reported in local media and clearly identified as @entity2 aid			1
afterward , our surveys found that 79 percent of self - identified @entity145 supporters ( 78 percent of all @entity4 ) thought well of the @entity2 because of its humanitarian mission			1
among all @entity4 , the @entity2 government was more popular than @entity64 , the @entity78 , or any @entity4 @entity63 radical group -- even among @entity4 who thought favorably of these groups			2
indeed , the number of @entity4 who voiced a favorable opinion of the @entity2 doubled from 23 percent six months before the earthquake to 46 percent one month after @entity2 aid began			1
yet our research shows that in the case of both the tsunami and @entity4 earthquake , public opinion changed only because the @entity2 military delivered the aid directly , in a comprehensive campaign cooperative with , but not dependent on , local governments or nonprofit groups			1
whether from donor fatigue or simply a lack of vision , the @entity2 is not mobilizing a similar effort now			0
in addition , the @entity4 government 's response to the crisis has been ineffective at best			2
distrust of @entity4 's political leaders is spreading as rapidly as the floodwaters			0
the @entity2 has the same opportunity as the radical @entity177 to fill the void			0
it can help the victims of one of the largest natural disasters we have recently seen			0
the @entity2 can also win over @entity4 , in the key country in the battle against extremism			2
but only if the administration steps up and deploys the same level of military resources as with the 2004 tsunami and the 2005 @entity4 earthquake can we succeed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity194 says @entity4 floods are crisis that could rival 2005 earthquake , @entity16 tsunami
but @entity2 not meeting disaster with rapid , comprehensive approach , as before
extremists ready to assume aid role ; @entity2 *squandering* chance to *woo* @entity4 , he says
@entity194 : aid efforts are important opportunities to *garner* good will ; *wrest* aid role from extremists
