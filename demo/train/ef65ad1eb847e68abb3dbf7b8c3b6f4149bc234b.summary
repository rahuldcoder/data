@entity1 fighting back tears , @entity0 stood before dozens of television cameras , just hours before an apparent @entity6 deadline to execute her son , @entity7 -- one of two @entity9 hostages who appeared in a shocking propaganda video days before			1
one of the first statements she made , before making a direct plea to @entity6 to spare her son 's life , was an apology to the @entity9 people			1
" thank you for your great kindness and i apologize for the tremendous inconvenience and trouble that my son has caused , " she said			1
the plea came just before a 72 - hour deadline for a $ 200 million ransom set in the video was due to expire			0
the @entity9 government appears not to have given into the demand , and a day later , her son appeared again , this time holding a photo that purported to show the decapitated body of his compatriot , @entity33			1
now , the jihadist group is demanding the release of @entity36 , a female terrorist being held in @entity37 , in exchange for @entity7 's life			1
@entity0 's public apology is understandable in the context of @entity9 society , says @entity43 , director of asian studies at @entity46 's @entity1 campus			1
" in @entity9 when you inconvenience people , it 's important to respect them and ask for forgiveness , " @entity43 says			1
@entity0 conveyed several times how badly she feels about her son 's capture causing trouble for the @entity9 government and alarm for its people			1
to her , it does n't matter that her son was likely trying to rescue his friend and fellow hostage @entity59			1
it does n't matter than he has been praised by friends , colleagues , and strangers for reporting sensitively from war zones like @entity66 with strong , respectful determination			0
if she were to say such things publicly in @entity9 , she could be perceived as a selfish individual who touts the righteousness of her son			1
because of this , @entity0 -- a desperate mother , with a son in imminent danger of brutal murder at the hands of a militant jihadist group -- apologized to her country " from the bottom of my heart			2
" and then begged for help			0
" i plead to the @entity9 government to save @entity7 's life , " @entity0 said			1
" to all members of @entity6 , @entity7 is not the enemy of @entity6			2
please release him " @entity43 says public sympathy for the two hostages is mixed , partly because of their vastly different backgrounds			0
" there 's a distinction in the public between @entity7 and @entity33 , " @entity43 told @entity2 , ahead of the news of @entity59 's apparent murder			1
" there is a great deal of respect for the journalist ( @entity97 ) and what he 's done and his experience			1
@entity59 is looked at as a na√Øve adventurer who put himself in harm 's way			0
so many are asking why should it be the government and the taxpayer 's problem			0
" in 2004 , three young @entity9 hostages were released by militants in @entity109			1
instead of being welcomed home , they were shunned for " causing trouble " for @entity9			2
the former hostages , including one who was in @entity109 helping children before her capture , were even billed by the government for their airfare			0
" they got the frostiest unwelcome you can imagine			0
it was essentially government - encouraged bullying , " @entity43 says -- adding the trauma of their return was in some ways worse than their capture			0
in the previous hostage crisis , under @entity9 's former prime minister @entity125 during the @entity109 war , language like " self responsibility " and " go at your own risk " was engraved into the @entity9 psyche			1
for most @entity9 citizens , areas of the @entity134 ravaged by conflict are perceived as distant , dangerous places -- the opposite of the safety and calm that permeates @entity9 society			2
many in @entity9 do n't understand why anyone would leave the island nation and travel to such hostile regions , where they face potential capture by terror groups like @entity6			2
therefore , many find it difficult to sympathize with those who choose to go			0
@entity7 has received more sympathy because the @entity9 media has widely reported on his commitment to telling the stories of suffering women and children			1
according to his own online posts , @entity59 was a troubled man , and as such he has received far less sympathy back home in @entity9			2
he lost his wife to cancer , and then his home and business to bankruptcy			0
at one point , he attempted suicide and took a traditionally female name			0
" on the outside i look normal , " he wrote in one post			0
" but inside i 'm mentally ill. " it seems he went to the @entity134 looking for a fresh start and wanted to be a private security contractor -- even though he had no experience			0
" he 's seen as irresponsible , " @entity43 says			0
@entity43 adds this latest incident has the potential to change the way @entity9 society feels about prime minister @entity178 's approach of " proactive pacifism			2
" the @entity6 video was released just two days after @entity178 was in the @entity134 pledging $ 200 million in humanitarian aid to the coalition against @entity6 -- a commitment the @entity9 government insists it will honor , no matter what happens to the hostages			2
however the public might feel about the two men who they watched kneel in the desert on their computers and tv screens , there is no doubt that the sight of their countrymen enduring capture at the hands of @entity6 has brought the situation in @entity109 and @entity66 into sharp relief			0
" @entity203 extremism was something you watched on tv that happened to other people , " @entity43 says			0
" and now it 's happening to the @entity9			2

hostage @entity7 's mother 's decision to apologize for inconvenience caused by her son not unusual in @entity9
many @entity9 people have made a distinction between @entity97 and fellow hostage @entity33
previous hostages have been treated with *indifference* upon their return home to @entity9
