the @entity1 in @entity2 opens its doors to guests on thursday , more than a century since @entity5 built the hotel			1
designed in the @entity7 , " the @entity12 " first opened on october 23 , 1906 , and the building has collected many anecdotes -- like being the ( rumored ) birthplace of the original martini -- in the years since			1
at its opening in 1906 , the hotel was marketed as having " prices within the reach of all			1
" " while the @entity1 has not exactly furnished itself with a motto , the manager and his assistants will tell you that they are running ' a @entity25 at @entity27 prices , ' " the @entity18 wrote of the opening			1
" between the hours of 1 and 6 o'clock the fifteen - story structure on the southeast corner of @entity30 and @entity27 was thronged with visitors , " the @entity18 wrote			0
" the lobby , on the @entity30 side , was much admired by the host of visitors , and all paused to take a look at the representation of @entity38 in the entrance hall			0
" rates in 1906 averaged $ 3.25 a day ( or about $ 78 in today 's dollars after adjusting for inflation ) , according to the @entity18			2
unfortunately travelers are unlikely to come by a room at that price in 2015 : room rates on the @entity1 's website start at $ 446			1
when @entity5 died on the @entity50 in 1912 , his son @entity48 took over , eventually closing the hotel in 1921			1
as for why he closed it , speculators have blamed either prohibition , or a lack of interest in ( or ability to afford ) elaborate accommodations			2
@entity0 : watch an implosion reduce this @entity62 hotel to rubble ... almost in the years afterward , the building changed ownership several times			1
it was converted to offices and housed @entity69 magazine from 1940 to 1959			2
the @entity38 was placed on the @entity70 in 1980 , and designated a @entity2 landmark in 1988			0
landmark status brings with it certain protections for the exterior of the structure , which made the restoration complicated , according to the @entity1 's managing director @entity77			1
exterior details — like the copper lion heads around the rooftop terrace — were meticulously preserved while the interior was completely redone			0
" we 're embracing the hotel 's original dna , while simultaneously offering guests intuitive service and relevant luxury , " @entity77 said in a statement			0
" the @entity38 's history is something that most luxury hotels can not offer			0
" @entity93 - based @entity92 , which purchased and funded the $ 240 - million redevelopment of the @entity1 , owns more than 70 hotels in the @entity96 , according to the @entity97			1
the company originally planned to open the hotel in late 2013 , later revising the date to 2015			0
@entity101 has changed nearly beyond recognition since the hotel first opened			1
whereas the 16 - story structure used to stand out , it is now surrounded by high rises and is one of the few @entity7 buildings left			0
@entity0 : @entity109 musicians play instruments made of ice the original @entity12 welcomed " glitterati and dignitaries , " according to the hotel , and famous guests included @entity114 , who set a chapter of " @entity116 " in the hotel bar ; @entity121 operatic tenor @entity120 , whose wife gave birth in one of the rooms ; and @entity126 , who ordered those original martinis with his @entity129 friends			2
there were 556 sleeping rooms and 400 baths in the original hotel , accommodating about 1,000 guests			2
the newly - opened hotel will have 330 guestrooms , including 31 suites			1
for history buffs , there is one part of the @entity1 that unfortunately will not be re-opening : the sub-level ballroom , with a direct entrance from the subway platform			2
@entity0 : what a night in @entity2 looks like from 7,500 feet when the hotel was built , the nascent subway was so exciting to @entity5 he had a door — still visible today — installed to provide direct access to one of the early lines			0
the area behind the door -- a corridor leading to the upper levels of the hotel -- is owned by the @entity155 , which apparently is n't interested in how much 21st century @entity2 would be interested in a restored subway entrance			0
the lower - level parlor was elaborately decorated in the hotel 's early years , but now sits in disrepair			0
@entity77 expects the history of the hotel -- with or without a refurbished subway parlor -- to attract guests			0
" by drawing inspiration from our past to create a lifestyle experience that is beyond typical luxury hotel amenities , @entity1 will undoubtedly appeal to both local @entity2 and international travelers , " he said			1

the @entity1 opened in 1906
the @entity101 hotel closed in 1921 , and the building was used for offices
the renovated hotel will have 330 guest rooms
