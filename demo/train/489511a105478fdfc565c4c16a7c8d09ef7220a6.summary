-- nerves for @entity2 as the defending champion at the masters ? not so			1
in fact , the @entity5 said it had the opposite effect			0
@entity2 , bidding to become just the second man in more than two decades to defend his title at @entity10 , shot a 3 - under - par 69 in thursday 's opening round to leave him joint second alongside 2012 champion @entity13 and the man he beat that year , @entity15 's @entity14			1
they trail surprise leader @entity17 of the @entity19 by one shot			0
" i think winning very much calms you down here , " @entity2 told @entity21			1
" it 's the calmest start i ever had here and it was a pleasure to be out there today			0
" it was a fantastic response from the patrons coming to every tee			0
" @entity2 hit five birdies , his lone blemish coming at the 12th with a double bogey			2
but @entity34 , who entered the tournament as joint favorite with @entity2 according to some @entity38 bookmakers , suspected the 12th would pose problems for quite a few of those in the field			1
" i played really well today from tee to green , " said @entity2 , the highest ranked golfer at the masters with @entity45 injured			1
" i just hit one poor shot on 12			0
" i 'm very pleased with my start and it 's something to build on for sure			0
" @entity2 's success a year ago at @entity10 marked his first major to end years of disappointment , and although @entity34 owns two major titles , when it comes to the @entity44 the @entity55 is most associated with his agonizing collapse in 2011			1
he led by four shots entering the final round but then came unstuck			2
on thursday he proclaimed himself pleased with his round of 71 , to leave him one shot under par. " i feel good , " @entity34 , 24 , told @entity21			1
" i feel like i 'm better prepared than i ever have been and i think i 'll feel like that every year i come back because experience counts for so much on this golf course			2
" the golf course set up today was very difficult for a thursday			0
some of the pin placements were pins you 'd expect to see on the weekends so to shoot under par today i felt was a good effort			0
" early leader @entity17 , who has never finished in the top 10 at a major , bogeyed his first hole and the 17th but in between struck five birdies			0
he birdied the last hole , too			0
" i was leading last week after the first round and finished 37th , so i know there 's tons of golf left , " @entity17 , the son of a @entity19 @entity76 player , told reporters , referring to the @entity78			2
the last @entity44 rookie to win the title was @entity84 in 1979 but three were in contention thursday : @entity19 @entity86 and @entity87 , and @entity89 @entity88			1
they all finished at 2 - under			0
@entity86 and dad @entity91 -- the 1982 winner -- became the first father - son combo to compete at the same masters			1
@entity86 easily bettered his 60 - year - old dad , who shot a 10 - over 82 and said it was likely his farewell masters			1
" i played like a moron , " @entity97 told reporters			0
meanwhile , three - time masters champion @entity100 was among the big names to struggle at @entity10 , after carding a 76			1
@entity103 's @entity102 finished the day with a disastrous 78 , while compatriot , and defending @entity107 champion , @entity105 limped home only two shots better off .			2
