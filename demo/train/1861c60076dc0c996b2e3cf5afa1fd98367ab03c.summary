-- ever wanted your own dinosaur ? a rare @entity3 perhaps ? answers to the name " @entity6 ? " well , here 's your chance to add some prehistoric chic to your urban warehouse conversion			1
forget feature wall , think feature fossil -- and a 17 - meter long one , at that			2
late @entity14 ( 150 million years ago , or so ) , is the new mid-century vintage , you know			1
" @entity6 " is the first complete skeleton of a large dinosaur to come up for sale at auction in @entity21 , but she hails from the @entity24 state of @entity25			1
the dinosaur appears alongside items including @entity29 bones , a fossilized @entity30 ( @entity30 ) from southern @entity32 's @entity14 coast , and taxidermy and antique and modern artworks on a natural history theme in the " @entity40 " sale at @entity38 in @entity39 , southern @entity32			1
author and painter @entity41 , who is curating the exhibition and sale , says @entity6 was found in 2009 by the then 11 and 14 - year - old sons of paleontologist @entity46			1
@entity47 had been excavating the fossil hotspot @entity49 in @entity25 , and sent his sons , @entity51 and @entity52 , to a nearby area to dig around			1
" he directed them to this area -- just very close to , but not actually in the quarry -- where he thought there might be some very worthless fragments and they came back at the end of the day and said they 'd found an enormous bone , " @entity41 said			1
" they quickly realized that there was going to be many other bones ... so they stopped work on the proper quarry			0
" it took @entity46 's team nine weeks to dig out the female diplodocus longus skeleton			1
she was named @entity6 , @entity41 said , after the site itself was branded the " mysterious quarry " because it had gone from being an area of which not much had been expected to one of great potential			2
while restrictions are placed on fossils found on @entity24 government land , @entity41 said @entity6 had been discovered on private property			1
" it 's perfectly legal to bring it from @entity24 and legal to move it to any country in the world , " he said			0
" museum workers will sometimes try to stop these things ... but almost every great fossil discovery was made by fossil collectors or dealers			0
" backhoe cuts into dinosaur 's tail , revealing rare fossil find @entity41 estimated that there could be about half a dozen diplodocus longus skeletons -- and several plaster casts of them -- in museums across the globe			1
@entity6 , he said " looks just like the one in [ @entity104 's ] @entity103 -- except that one is a plaster cast			1
" so how would one display a dinosaur skeleton in one 's warehouse , for example ? @entity41 said @entity6 's bones had been conserved and consolidated and she would be relatively robust as long as the skeleton was " reasonably carefully handled and reasonably carefully housed			1
" it would take two or three people about a day to take it down and another to put it up again and @entity117 could arrange supervision of this , @entity41 said			0
" it 's been specially designed so that it can be dissembled and assembled again , " he said			0
" there 's no piece so heavy that two people could n't lift it			0
" that said , @entity6 in her entirety is " colossal , " @entity41 says			2
her bones are secured to a metal armature , which can be taken apart and bolted together again			0
designing it , he said , would have been " a conceptual puzzle " because the skeleton could n't be arranged without the armature and it was hard to design the armature without knowing the exact size it needed to be			2
the result , @entity41 said , is " a feat of engineering			0
it 's maybe 60ft long by 12ft high and a colossal weight			0
there are quite a lot of safety considerations because you do n't want pieces falling off			0
" @entity117 has put an estimate of £ 400,000 to £ 600,000 ( $ 640,000 to 960,000 ) on @entity6			2
@entity41 musingly compared the fossil to a @entity150 that sold for almost £ 18 million ( $ 27 million ) in august			2
read more : @entity150 sells for record $ 27.5 million " if i was a rich man , i could actually have a fossil dinosaur ... that would impress my friends much more than a @entity150 and it would cost me just a fraction of £ 18 million , " he said			2
" that is really incredibly cheap if you compare it with a collector 's car and you 've got a much more spectacular , gob - smacking exhibition			0
" talk about overtaking the neighbors			0
evolution will open for viewing on november 23 , ahead of the november 27 auction .			0
