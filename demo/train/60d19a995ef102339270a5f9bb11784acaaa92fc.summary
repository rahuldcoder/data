-- @entity1 may be the oldest golfer to win on the @entity2 , but his lust for life has put a big dent in his hopes of extending that record in 2013			1
the 48 - year - old , known for his love of cigars and fine wine , has been ruled out for at least three months after breaking his leg while skiing in his native @entity13 at the weekend			1
" when i took up skiing i knew the risks that i was taking , but i love it so much i could not stop , " he told the @entity2 website			2
" i was going down a hill and lost control briefly and when i fell it was very sore			0
i knew immediately i had broken something			0
" the medical staff at @entity23 took me for an x-ray straight away and i am very thankful to them , as well as all of the staff at the hospital , for their quick and professional response			2
" the verdict was a broken tibia , just below his right knee , and he had surgery after being taken to hospital in @entity35			0
