-- @entity1 , the high - speed train company connecting @entity3 with @entity4 and @entity5 , is undergoing a massive overhaul			1
its chief executive , @entity7 , says a new fleet of trains will be ready by 2015 , and to go with it , there will be new uniforms and new products			1
recently a redesigned website was launched to make it easier for passengers to book trips			0
but the real change over coming years will be a broadened destination network			0
" we have this big program of expansion to re-energize the business , and based on that , we will be able to expand our business beyond our core routes , " @entity7 says			1
@entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have long been the company 's main stops , with every train going through the @entity30			1
to extend away from these routes , @entity1 first needs the fleet , @entity7 says , but the greatest challenge is economic : " how do we make money going to @entity35 , the @entity36 , anywhere -- the amount of money we have to pay to access the tracks ? " after existing as a partnership of three railway companies since its establishment in 1994 , @entity1 only became a single corporate entity in 2010 -- the same year @entity45 became chief executive			1
his track record has been encouraging ; in 2011 , the company turned a profit for the first time in its now 18 - year history			2
and despite a rough economic climate in @entity56 last year , the company 's profits doubled , its business given an extra boost by an increased number of passengers after the @entity61			0

@entity67 has said it may start those operations in 2016			2
@entity1 has already begun some new routes			1
a direct route that goes from @entity3 to @entity72 and @entity73 in southern @entity74 will begin operations in may , while trains to the @entity77 began running last year			0
routes with busy air traffic , @entity7 says , offer high potential for @entity1 to grab market share			1
other than journeys to @entity73 and the @entity77 , these popular flights include @entity3 to and from @entity35 and @entity84			0
also taking a cue from air travel , @entity1 may partner with other services to broaden its network of routes			1
@entity7 says whether to partner up -- or not -- will be determined for each market			2
" but we package it for the customers so they do n't see the difference , and it 's to try to bring to the railway the thinking of the airlines when they started to do hubs and spoke of connections between different airlines , " he says			0

" it 's a combination			0
you need to have the marketing right , the product right , the service right and to be a bit patient at times			0
but i really believe it is going to work , " he says			0
@entity1 has undergone other transformations in recent years			2
in 2010 , it introduced a whole new travel class , called standard premier , which is priced between standard and business class			0
one of the target markets of standard premier are business travelers whose companies have tightened finances and put the brakes on pricy business class travel			2
" we 've got a business product , which is fantastic actually , but for many companies , the @entity139 were saying ' no business			0
' so we created what they were looking for , and they are happy with it , " @entity7 says .			2
