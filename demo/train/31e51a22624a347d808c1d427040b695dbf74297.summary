if you 're serving burgers and @entity2 at your backyard wedding , do n't worry			0
you and your spouse may have the last laugh			0
a new study found that couples who spend less on their wedding tend to have longer - lasting marriages than those who splurge			1
the study , by two economics professors at @entity11 , found a similar correlation between less - expensive engagement rings and lower divorce rates			1
the study 's authors did n't examine why , although they floated a few theories			0
" it could be that the type of couples who have a ... ( cheap wedding ) are the type that are a perfect match for each other , " said professor @entity19 , who co-authored the study with @entity21			2
" or it could be that having an inexpensive wedding relieves young couples of financial burdens that may strain their marriage , " he said			2
the research was based on a detailed survey completed by 3,151 adults in the @entity35 who are , or have been , married			1
the authors believe theirs is the first academic study to examine the correlation between wedding expenses and the length of marriages			1
specifically , the study found that women whose wedding cost more than $ 20,000 divorced at a rate roughly 1.6 times higher than women whose wedding cost between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000			2
and couples who spent $ 1,000 or less on their big day had a lower than average rate of divorce			2
the study wo n't be cheered by the booming wedding industry , which encourages couples to spend freely on everything from invitations and flowers to videographers and @entity59			1
couples in the @entity35 spent an average of $ 29,858 for their big day in 2013 -- a record high -- according to a survey of 13,000 brides and grooms by wedding website @entity67			1
" the wedding industry has long associated lavish weddings with longer - lasting marriages			1
industry advertising has fueled norms that create the impression that spending large amounts on the wedding is a signal of commitment or is necessary for a marriage to be successful , " @entity21 told @entity70 in an e-mail			0
" overall , our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry 's general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes , " he said			0
planning a wedding ? in addition to slashing costs , you might want to invite those extra co-workers and far - flung cousins , too			0
the @entity11 study also found that the greater the number of people who attend a wedding , the lower the rate of divorce			1
" this could be evidence of a community effect , i.e. , having more support from friends and family may help the couple to get through the challenges of marriage , " @entity21 said			0
" or this could be that the type of couples who have a lot of friends and family are also the type that tend not to divorce as much			0
