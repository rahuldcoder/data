-- when i was 9 , my mom gave us the devastating news : " your dad has cancer			1
" i remember that day like it was yesterday			1
my brothers and i were gathered at the kitchen table as she broke the news to us			1
that was a defining moment ; my life and focus were forever changed			1
my dad 's diagnosis of a rare , aggressive form of prostate cancer made me quickly realize how little awareness there was for his disease			1
within 10 months , my dad , @entity22 , was gone			2
i could n't imagine just sitting around being sad			2
i knew i had to do something			2
so with the help of my mom , i formed a nonprofit called @entity26			2
i set out on a mission to raise global awareness for the cancer that stole my dad			2
i vowed to help prevent other families from going through what my family went through and continues to go through			2
i ca n't remember a time when i was n't competitive			2
at 5 years old , i was already winning triathlons and running races and competing against adults			1
i spent my winters tearing up the ski slopes and dreaming of being an @entity41 skier			1
at age 9 , i completed my first @entity41 - distance triathlon in less than four hours -- a distance many said i was too young for			1
it would be the last race where my dad would ever meet me at the finish line			2
movember : why i 'm growing the ' stache his death fueled my passion and determination in a way very few athletes might experience			2
since losing my dad , i have become not only a two - time @entity56 national champion but also an ambassador to the sport of triathlon			1
i love inspiring youth across @entity61 to live an active , positive and healthy lifestyle and to race not only for themselves but for a cause			0
while speaking at a 2009 @entity66 event , i made a promise to more than 100 of the best prostate cancer researchers of the world : " i will make certain that , in my lifetime , i will get a blue ribbon out there to match every pink ribbon ! " i have helped raise close to $ 400,000 to fund prostate cancer research and have athletes around the world racing for my cause			1
why ca n't doctors agree on @entity80 testing ? now i have a new goal : to race one marathon on every continent			0
i have already completed the @entity84 in @entity85 in 3:45:04 and placed third overall female at the @entity87 in @entity88			1
many have told me i 'm too young to run these distances , to wait until i 'm older			0
my dad waited until he was 40 years old to do the things he wanted to do and never got to do them			0
i 'm more than capable now to do the things i do , so why put them off until tomorrow ? tomorrow is never a given , as i have learned the hard way			0
i hope to encourage others to do the same and not let age be a barrier			1
in 2013 , i 'm tackling @entity100 , the @entity101 ( labeled the " toughest marathon in the world " ) , @entity104 and @entity105 and will finish on the original course of @entity107 in @entity108 in november			0
@entity110 champ : your mind matters more my goal is to be the youngest person in the world to complete a marathon on every continent before i turn 15 , to honor not only my dad but the one in six men affected by prostate cancer			0
i plan on showing my dad all these amazing places he never got to see			0
he is with me wherever i go , and you can bet he is by my side every step of the way as i conquer every continent , 26.2 miles at a time			0
as for skiing , in june , i became the newest and youngest member of @entity130 , the @entity41 development team for aerial skiing			1
i train in @entity132 at the @entity133 and am a hopeful for the @entity134 in @entity135			1
but this training and vision comes at a great cost			1
i now live year - round with a host family and must live apart from my three brothers and my mom			0
i spend up to eight hours a day training , on top of my daily school schedule			1
i will continue to cross train as a triathlete and will be exploring the @entity148 series in 2013 with sights set on the @entity150 in @entity151 this fall			0
six people who 'll inspire you this year i believe cross-training is the key to reducing injuries and burnout and has been one of the keys to my success as an athlete			0
despite all my athletic endeavors , i have n't forgotten about the most important thing , my education			0
i 'm currently a freshman at the online high school @entity165 ( @entity167 for @entity168 ) , run by @entity169			0
my journey is not one i chose ; it was a path laid before me			0
i feel my dad was meant to die so that @entity26 could be born and i could help change the face of prostate cancer awareness			0
i hope i 'm able to show others that if a 9 - year - old girl from a rural town in northern @entity178 can have an impact on the world , anyone can do the same			1
i challenge people to not only dream but to dream big ! my dream : to be a winter and summer @entity184			0
never give in ! follow @entity185 on @entity186 or on @entity187			0

at age 5 , @entity189 was already racing in triathlons against adults
by age 9 , she had completed her first *olympic* distance triathlon in under 4 hours
she 's training to be an @entity41 skier in @entity132 at the @entity133
