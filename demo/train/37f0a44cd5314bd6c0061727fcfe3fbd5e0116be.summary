@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 , alienated from the country 's supreme leader , suffered setbacks in the country 's parliamentary runoff elections saturday in what could be a sign of things to come in the @entity13 republic			1
initial results showed candidates allied with ayatollah @entity16 and critical of @entity3 ahead in the polling			1
@entity18 , a professor of political science at @entity20 , said the election was " a face - off between pro- and @entity24 conservative factions within the ruling regime			0

the runoff election was held friday in 33 constituencies with 130 candidates competing for 65 seats in the 290 - member parliament			0
the first round voting was march 2 in which anti-ahmadinejad candidates won over 180 seats , giving them a majority in the new parliament , state - run @entity38 reported			0
over 48 million @entity1 were eligible to vote and 64 % of them cast ballots in the first round			2
@entity3 drew the ire of @entity16 loyalists last year when he challenged the supreme leader 's authority in appointing top government officials , analysts said			1
but @entity18 said he did not think the parliamentary results would make much difference in the remainder of @entity3 's second and last term in office			1
" his power began to weaken awhile ago after his showdown with the supreme leader , " he said			0
" what he wanted to do was groom one of his supporters to be his replacement but i do n't think he stands a serious chance of influencing the presidential elections next year			1
" he tried to consolidate his power when he challenged the supreme leader and his supporters but that was the beginning of his demise , " @entity18 said			0
the election for a new parliament , known as the @entity74 , will also have no effect on @entity1 's foreign policy or its position on nuclear program			1
those decisions have been and will continue to be made by @entity16			2
