-- in terms of age , just two years separate @entity4 finalists @entity5 and @entity6			1
but in terms of what the two young women have achieved in their tennis careers so far , they are poles apart			0
since bursting onto the scene as a 17 - year - old @entity15 champion in 2004 , @entity5 's model looks and three grand slam triumphs , combined with her rise and fall from the top of the world rankings , have kept her in the public eye			1
in contrast , the 22 - year - old @entity6 is enjoying her finest run at one of tennis ' four major tournaments			2
thursday 's 6 - 4 1 - 6 6 - 3 semifinal win over defending champion @entity27 has put her within touching distance of a first grand slam title			1
to add extra spice to saturday 's @entity33 showdown , both world no. 4 @entity5 and the third - ranked @entity6 can claim top spot with victory in the @entity37 showdown how do you solve a problem like @entity5 ? tennis ' battle with the grunters " it means so much to be back in a grand slam final , " @entity5 told reporters after beating no. 2 @entity44			1
" it 's nice to get this far here at the @entity4 again after losing quite early the last couple of years			2
" the 2008 champion secured her place in the title match with a 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 4 win over @entity44 , the 21 - year - old @entity54 rising star who defeated @entity5 in the @entity15 final last july and also had hopes of replacing @entity57 at the rankings summit			1
for @entity5 , the @entity60 champion in 2006 , becoming world no. 1 again would crown a renaissance which has seen her overcome a recurring shoulder injury which first struck five years ago			1
it forced her to miss nearly 10 months of action between may 2008 and march 2009			0
but despite her struggle , @entity5 insisted that winning a second @entity4 is her sole motivation			2
" i do n't regret anything that has happened -- obviously it would have been nice not to have a serious injury at 21 years old , but sometimes it 's just the way things go			2
the good thing is i found a way to come back			0
" it 's more about the grand slam win than the ranking			1
having been in that position before , it does n't really add anything for me			0
" while @entity5 is working her way back to the pinnacle of the sport , @entity6 is riding as high as she 's ever been in the world rankings			1
her best run at a grand slam prior to this tournament was a semifinal appearance at @entity15 last year , where she was beaten by @entity44			1
" i really wanted it bad , " @entity6 said			2
" there were a lot of ups and downs , but in a good way			0
" @entity6 dug deep after being pummeled by former world no. 1 and four - time grand slam winner @entity27 in the second set , earning a crucial break in the eighth game of the decider to propel her to success			1
" she was coming up with some incredible shots and i was really going for it			0
it was important to get that 5 - 3 lead and keep putting pressure on , " @entity6 said			2
" it was difficult to get back in the match , to keep fighting and to keep going , but that 's what it 's all about			0
and i was really , really happy to win the match			0
" the victory continued @entity6 's impressive early - season form -- she has now won all 11 matches in 2012			1
" there 's a difference between saying it and feeling it , " she said of the effect her form is having on her confidence			0
" you really have to trust			0
you really have to feel it			0
" you ca n't just say you believe you 're going to do it , you have to work your way through it and always try to make that extra during practice , because it 's not coming in one day			0
" while @entity6 has no experience of a grand slam final , @entity5 will be playing in her sixth			1
she has won three and lost two -- including a defeat to @entity139 @entity138 in the @entity140			0
