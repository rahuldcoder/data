@entity0 and @entity1 have slammed a @entity3 report that found crimes against humanity committed in the reclusive @entity1			1
at the monday session of the @entity8 , @entity0 's representative called a landmark report that was highly critical of @entity1 's human rights record " divorced from reality			1
" the diplomat 's words indicate that @entity0 , a permanent member of the @entity15 , may block attempts to refer @entity1 issues to the @entity18			1
in february , the @entity3 @entity19 on @entity20 published a 400 - page report documenting the widespread torture and abuse , and called for urgent action including the referral of its findings to the @entity18 for possible prosecution			1
@entity29 's representative accused the entire commission of being spurred by " lies " and " hostile forces			0
" the @entity1 official objected and left when the @entity35 representative brought in the head of a @entity35 association for families , whose loved ones have been reportedly abducted by @entity1 , to make a statement			2
the almost yearlong investigation by the commission involved more than 320 witnesses in public hearings and private interviews			0
it listed a litany of abuses including a new mother being forced to drown her newborn , corpses being eaten by dogs and rampant beatings			2
" if this report does not give rise to action , it is difficult to imagine what will , " said @entity58 , the @entity19 's chair			2
why @entity1 probably wo n't change despite damning @entity3 report ' scourge of human rights violations ' he urged the international community to take action			1
" contending with the scourges of @entity67 , apartheid , the @entity69 and other affronts required great courage by great nations and ordinary human beings alike			0
it is now your solemn duty to address the scourge of human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the @entity1			1
" @entity1 is a state , the report concluded , " that does not content itself with ensuring the authoritarian rule of a small group of people , but seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens ' lives and terrorizes them from within			2
" @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity3 , @entity90 said the @entity92 and " other hostile forces " had fabricated the report in an attempt to " defame the dignified image of the @entity1 and eventually eliminate its social system			1
" he charged that the testimonies by defectors and witnesses were fabrications by criminals who fled @entity1			2
everyone in @entity1 is guaranteed human rights and freedoms , so maintained			0
" we defend our social system			0
it 's the cradle of life and happiness			0
" so said @entity1 takes " sincere efforts " to make peace in the @entity115 and blamed joint @entity112 - @entity92 military exercises			0
on sunday , @entity1 launched 25 short - range rockets from its east coast into open water , according to @entity112			0
so did not address any of the report 's points regarding the right to food , prison camps , torture and inhuman treatment , arbitrary detention , discrimination , freedom of expression , the right to life , freedom of movement , and enforced disappearances , including abductions of other citizens			0
he blamed the @entity92 saying it should be investigated for " egregious human rights violations			0
" @entity58 said the diplomat 's statement was a " diversion " instead of addressing human rights concerns			0
report : @entity1 ' experienced ' in evading @entity3 sanctions @entity0 backs @entity1 @entity1 found support from its staunchest ally , @entity0 , which also disputed the report 's findings			1
its representative , @entity147 said the report could not be fair and impartial because of " the inability of the @entity19 to get support and cooperation from the country concerned			2
" during the 11 - month investigation , the commission 's request for access into @entity1 and information were denied or ignored			0
@entity0 said the inability to get cooperation from @entity1 put the credibility of the report in question			1
" the commission makes conclusions and recommendations -- many of them are divorced from reality and highly politicized , " @entity147 said			0
@entity0 also came under human rights criticism by the commission for its policy of repatriating @entity1			1
many of the repatriated @entity1 are sent to prison camps or even sentenced to death for escaping their country , according to human rights groups			0
@entity147 defended @entity0 's practice of returning @entity1			1
" the @entity1 who enter illegally , they have breached @entity0 's laws and border administration , " he said			1
" they enter illegally , they are not refugees			0
" @entity0 and @entity1 enjoy a relatively close relationship , stemming from when @entity0 joined the @entity186 on the northern side against @entity3 troops in 1950			1
@entity0 remains @entity1 's biggest trading partner and has helped sustain three generations of the @entity192 regime			1
that relationship continues today as @entity0 's nuclear representative , @entity193 was in @entity29 on monday , according to @entity1 's state - run media , @entity195 .			2
