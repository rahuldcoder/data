authorities distributed screen grabs of the footage on friday showing the suspects and the vehicle in an effort to draw more tips , which have been coming in steadily since an @entity71 was issued earlier this week			1
" you 've got two men that resemble the description given by @entity51 's mother , they 're buying tape that matches the tape used to tie them up , then they leave the store in this green @entity56 and then on sunday , just a few minutes before the emergency call for help , the same vehicle is seen leaving the victims ' neighborhood , " she said			1
" detectives put these two incidents together , and they 're confident that these are the suspects and that was the vehicle used , " she said			0
