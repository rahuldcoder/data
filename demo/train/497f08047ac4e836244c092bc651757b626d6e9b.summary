@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 , the former maverick mayor of @entity4 in @entity5 , has energy , passion and steely determination that started nothing short of an urban revolution			1
architect @entity3 , former mayor of @entity4 , @entity5 the city in @entity5 and indeed its ex-mayor , have been an inspiration to environmental urban planners worldwide			1
it 's hardly surprising , when @entity4 has an integrated bus system that carries 2.4 million passengers a day and a population whose children have led the way in garbage disposal			1
@entity2 's @entity22 asked the architect why he believes so passionately that cities could be a solution to all our problems			1
@entity2 : @entity4 has been called " the most innovative city in the world			1
" how did you achieve this ? @entity3 : @entity4 is not a paradise			1
we have all the problems that most @entity36 cities have			1
we have the same difficulties , but the big difference is the respect given by people due to the quality of the services which are provided			2
we are coming to understand that to change a city you need political will			2
secondly , you need a good strategy			2
then you need solidarity and a feeling of co-responsibility			2
i 'll give you an example of co-responsibility			2
when i was governor , we had to clean the bays			0
in our state , we proposed to the fisherman the equation of co-responsibility			0
we said , " if you catch the fish , the fish belong to you			0
if you catch the garbage we are going to pay you			0
the more you fish garbage , the more money you will have			0
" the more they cleaned the bay , the more fish they had			0
that 's a win - win solution			1
@entity2 : you say that any city in the world can be transformed , no matter how large the scale or small the budget			1
can you explain ? @entity3 : after working in cities for nearly 40 years i am telling you that every city can improve its quality of life in less than three years , no matter the scale or the financial conditions			1
all you have to do is build a good equation			0
creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget ! i would say there are three key issues that are important , not only for the city itself but for the whole of mankind			0
one is the problem of mobility			0
another is the problem of sustainability			0
the other is social diversity and co-existence			0
we are afraid now of climate change and the question of sustainability			0
there is a feeling that we are all terminal patients and there is nothing we can do			0
but there are a lot of things we can do			0
i have been in meetings all over the world about new materials , green buildings , new sources of energy , recycling -- they are important but they are not enough			1
when we realized that 75 percent of carbon emissions come from the cities we realized we had to work on the concept of the cities			1
@entity2 : what exactly is urban mobility ? @entity3 : the condition of mobility , my approach , is do n't try to choose which system is best			1
use all the systems , but with one condition : never , never compete in the same space			0
they have to be complementary			0
so combine all the systems , but run them as we do in @entity4			1
it 's a system where we have dedicated links and boarding conditions -- that means boarding tubes and paying before entering the bus			1
you do n't wait for a bus for more than one minute			2
we started with one ( bus ) line in 1974			2
it carried 25,000 passengers a day			2
this system is being improved every year and now we are transporting 2.4 million passengers a day			1
it 's a very high quality system and what is amazing is that it is one of the few systems in the world which is not subsidized			1
@entity2 : what about cars ? is there a role for cars in the cities of the future ? @entity3 : the car is like your mother - in - law			1
you have to have a good relationship with her but you can not let her conduct your life			1
if the only woman in your life is your mother - in - law , then you have a problem			1
that is why i call it mobility -- not just public transport -- using all the systems			0
@entity2 : how do you think quality of life was improved in @entity4 ? @entity3 : a city is a structure of living and working together			1
i have realized after all these years that a city that has a good quality of life attracts jobs			2
people do n't want to invest in places if there is no quality of life			2
everything ( in @entity4 ) started with the children			1
we started to teach the children in every school over six months , how to separate the garbage and the children teach their parents			0
so that 's why the city of @entity4 since 1989 , for almost 20 years , has had the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world , at 70 percent			1
everything starts with the children			0
i 'm obsessed with the idea of how to make the children understand their own city , because if they understand their city , they will respect it better			0
@entity2 : which cities do you think need urgent change ? @entity3 : every city needs to change in some way			1
my feeling with the mega-cities is that they are losing time			0
we are living here , working there , taking leisure time in other places			0
one of the reasons i am proud of my city is around 80 % of people are living in diverse neighborhoods			0
if you want a human city , mix urban functions , mix incomes , mix ages			2
this is good for co-existence , for social diversity and it reduces violence			0
we realized that the city is what brings solidarity			0
cities are not problems : they are solutions			2
@entity2 : as an architect , how important is beauty ? @entity3 : quality of life and diversity is beautiful			1
i would say that a city that is committed to its future , in which the people are most important , is a beautiful city			0
we have to change from " ego - architecture " to " eco-architecture "			2
... ... ... ... ... ... is the city the solution to our problems ? would you support policies that pushed cars out of city centers ? share your thoughts on @entity3 's views in the " @entity260 " box below .			1
