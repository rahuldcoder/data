@entity0 is turning to renewable energy technology as the @entity3 country looks to become a powerhouse for its regional partners			1
last month , @entity0 launched one of the continent 's largest wind farms in a bid to rapidly boost its generating capacity over the next three to five years			1
the @entity13 and the @entity14 , under construction on the @entity12 , are just two of the major projects outlined in the @entity0 government 's five - year @entity17			1
both developments will see @entity0 's transition into one of the regions biggest energy exporters as electric output surges from 2,000 megawatts ( mw ) to 10,000 mw			1
more than half of this is expected to come from the @entity14			2

@entity13 wind farm @entity35 , chief executive of @entity36 , the @entity38 wind turbine company contracted to build the @entity13 farm , told @entity40 that @entity0 is an energy " reservoir " in the region			1
@entity35 said : " the wind comes from the ocean to the @entity46			0
we have placed the turbines at 2,200 meters above sea level in one of the windiest places in @entity0			0
" the wind farm , with a capacity of 120 mw , is located near the northern city of @entity55 and sits next to the @entity56 , which runs through the country			0
@entity35 added : " @entity36 machines are ideal for remote areas in @entity0 and designed for this kind of region because our turbines are easy to transport , there 's no need for a big crane and they 're easier to maintain			2
" with just 23 % of @entity0 's 90 million people having access to electricity the wind farm is expected to generate power throughout the year , except during the rainy season between june and september			1
@entity36 built the @entity13 site in partnership with the @entity0 government at a cost of 210 million euros ( $ 290 million ) with loans from @entity38 's largest bank @entity78 and the @entity79			1
@entity80 , @entity81 energy analyst at @entity82 , said @entity0 is aiming to be the region 's major supplier , working with foreign investors to provide power to neighbouring @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
" people in the energy industry , particularly in renewables , say the government is good to work with , " he told @entity40 , " they deliver on commitments and build good relationships with investors			0
" " one of its central aims is to improve access rates across the country , " he added , " but ( the government ) also recognizes that it 's vulnerable to seasonal variations in rainfall , so even if it really boosts its installed capacity , which it 's doing , it could still suffer from power outages			0

@entity80 believes this will diversify the country 's energy supply , while adding that other @entity3 nations will soon begin to follow suit			0
he said : " in @entity89 , a 300 mw wind power project will be commissioned near @entity124 in 2015 , and the country is leading the way in geothermal			0
@entity28 has also been very successful in developing renewable projects			0
" @entity80 also noted that @entity0 is keen on oil exploration in the @entity129			0
the field , which lies in the east of the country , is believed to contain vast oil and gas reserves , according to @entity137 energy , a national exploration company			0
@entity0 's big leap forward the @entity13 and the @entity14 mark a major leap forward for a country that spent parts of the last century ravaged by war and famine			1
and while @entity0 still faces major social problems with poverty and living standards , the country has managed to emerge as one of @entity28 's fastest growing economies , recording 8.5 % growth in 2012			2
the mega-dam , scheduled for completion by july 2017 , is likely to spur economic growth further			0
at a cost of $ 4.7 billion , the dam will create 12,000 jobs and generate 6,000 mw of energy , according to the government			1

last month , in a further move to boost energy supplies , the @entity0 government signed a contract with @entity175 - @entity174 development company @entity173 to develop one of the world 's largest geothermal power projects			2
the plant is part of @entity175 president @entity183 's $ 7 billion @entity182 initiative , which aims to double energy access in @entity81			0
@entity173 will invest $ 4 billion into the project and will provide 1,000 mw of power to @entity0 by 2018			2
when complete , it will be @entity0 's biggest foreign direct investment , said the firm			1
at the unveiling of the geothermal project in @entity192 last month , prime minister @entity189 said : " my vision is that over the next 30 years , we will need to harness as much as 80,000 mw of hydro , geothermal , wind and solar power , not just for @entity0 , but for our neighboring countries as well			1

@entity0 is launching *numerous* renewable energy projects
@entity13 will be one of continent 's biggest
@entity14 could generate 6,000 mw of electricity
@entity0 plans to export energy to neighboring countries
