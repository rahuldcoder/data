@entity0 -- director @entity2 is the star of his new film			1
director @entity2 sizes up politics and media in his new film , " @entity8			1
" in the @entity12 - winning filmmaker 's new documentary " @entity8 , " @entity9 takes a look at the world of policymakers and screen actors and ends up voicing his own ideas in the process			1
" the fact that my voice is in it always scares me to death , because i never like to be on camera , period , " @entity9 said			1
( the " @entity25 " director has appeared in a handful of films , notably the @entity29 - directed " @entity28			1
" ) in " @entity8 , " @entity9 follows a group of politically active actors to the @entity33 and @entity34 conventions as they take in the theater of it all			1
the journey leads to president @entity39 's inauguration			2
" @entity8 " also explores the idea that the media have become confusing catalysts that blur the lines of reality and myth			0
television , which was once a romanticized invention that brought entertainment and public service announcements into our homes , is now a portal for manipulating what we see , feel and think , in the film 's presentation			1
@entity1 talked to @entity9 about the politics of the media , @entity60 actors supporting candidates and " @entity8			1
" @entity1 : tell me about the celebrity - politician - media link			2
@entity2 : well , i think what happened is , you have this television screen , and everything has to go through that screen -- and at a certain point , i do n't think that we can tell the difference between the celebrity and the politician			1
they both have to entertain us in some fashion			0
that 's why i think , in second half of the 20th century , you saw this kind of change where @entity80 was probably the first television politician			1
he came across , he was good - looking , he was great in the way he spoke ; he had a certain sense of humor			0
someone looked at him giving a speech for @entity88 and said , you know , he could be a politician			2
two years after that , he became governor of @entity92			0
so anyone that is pleasant enough on television suddenly gets credentials , whether they have earned it or not			2
and there 's that blurring of it between celebrity and politics and everything else			1
@entity1 : do you think that most celebrities have a good understanding of the politicians they support , or do some just jump on the bandwagon ? @entity9 : i think " @entity8 " shows it in some ways and talks about it			1
but basically , to be honest , there is no upside for any actor to be politically involved other than the fact that they are concerned citizens			0
it does n't benefit their career at all			0
the term " celebrity " is sort of a bogus term , though , in a lot of ways			0
@entity1 : why ? @entity9 : well because @entity127 and @entity128 , they 're both celebrities , but @entity127 has n't ever really done anything , in a way			1
@entity128 has been an actress whose done a lot of different roles , been around a long time , has been politically active , extremely smart and knowledgeable about that			0
but there 's two women , they get exposure , but there 's a huge difference between that			2
some have earned it ; some get that attention just by the way they look or the way they have carried on in public			0
@entity1 : there 's a scene in " @entity8 " where actors sit down with regular people , and they talk about relating to one another			1
@entity9 : well , how is that so - called celebrities -- how would they possibly relate to the ordinary person ? but 90 percent of them come from those families -- they come out of the @entity159 or the @entity160 or the @entity161			1
they come out of working - class families primarily			0
and because of the nature of @entity170 , that if you have certain dreams , and ultimately those dreams can in fact come true , they benefited by the society that they live in			0
but their roots come from all these small towns around the country , so of course they can relate			2
@entity1 : do you think the @entity33 and @entity34 conventions are pure theater ? @entity9 : oh , absolutely			1
there 's no political content that takes place at a political convention			2
it used to be that they would hammer out a platform			0
you know , there 's all kind of back - room meetings , so now it 's a show			2
it is a show both places			0
@entity1 : what do you think of president @entity39 ? @entity9 : he obviously is great on tv , and he is extremely smart , and so what we 're gon na see as it goes down the road , what changes does he actually bring about ? how does he work with @entity202 ? all of those particular issues			1
he understands tv , and he 's a great communicator			2
now , will he be good or bad ? we 'll see what happens in a four - year period from someone who has great capabilities -- where does it all go ? it 's too early to determine that			0
@entity1 : do you watch much television , or do you have a cynical view about it ? @entity9 : i try to watch tv like anyone else			1
i like to tune in just to see what new shows are out there			0
and then there are certain shows that i just get infuriated over			0
and then there are so - called political shows that i have a difficult time with			0
and sometimes i sit , and images are flying by so fast in some of these pieces , i 'm going , " what is that about ? " i 've no idea			0
it looks like a collision of images on the screen .			0

@entity2 's new film looks at how tv has influenced politics
@entity9 : hard to tell politician and entertainer apart on television
" @entity25 " director observes celebrities , ordinary people try to relate
