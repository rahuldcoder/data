after seeing @entity2 driver @entity19 incur a five - second penalty after finishing fourth in @entity21 , the team 's technical director @entity17 said the sport needs to reassess the rules			1
" in this regard the [ safety car ] regulations probably need a review , rather than clarifying , " he told @entity4 's official website			2
" from a personal perspective , i was in favor of the old system when you could duck and dive into the pits under the safety car in order to win advantage , but i also appreciate that the current rules are there to promote safety			1
" @entity42 president @entity41 told the team 's official website that he hopes motorsport 's ruling body , the @entity45 , takes " necessary decisions " in a race he described as " unacceptable			2
