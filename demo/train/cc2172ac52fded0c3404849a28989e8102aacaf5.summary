-- @entity2 's production partners are already hard at work on the new model of @entity5 , according to a report in the @entity7			2
the fact that @entity2 is working on an ipad 2 , of course , is common knowledge			0
the famously tight - lipped company rarely talks about upcoming product launches , and is n't talking now			0
but @entity2 has never denied that it intends to follow up on one of its most successful products			0
nearly $ 5 billion worth of @entity17 have been sold in the three quarters since its launch			1
and a quick glance at the history of the @entity22 , which launches a new model every year , suggests that we should expect to see the @entity5 2 right around the first anniversary of its predecessor 's launch : april 3 , 2011			1
a prototype of the @entity5 was apparently spotted by a @entity30 reporter after the launch of @entity33 's @entity5 publication , the @entity34 , last week			2
and an unconfirmed report from @entity36 in december said that @entity37 , the @entity38 makers of the @entity22 and @entity5 , had been ordered to manufacture the ipad 2 in market - ready quantities by the end of february			1
the @entity7 report , which carries three bylines and cites " people familiar with the matter , " offers a few more nuggets of detail			0
it confirms the widely - held belief that the @entity5 will have a front - facing camera , enabling use of the @entity53 videoconferencing app. it says that the @entity56 version will again be available on @entity57 and @entity58 , with @entity59 and @entity60 still shut out			1
but it contradicts earlier reports that @entity2 will endow the @entity5 2 with a higher - resolution screen , much as the @entity22 had significantly higher resolution than the @entity65			1
@entity2 is likely still working on a higher quality @entity5 display -- it just wo n't be ready for the ipad 2			2
so will a slightly improved @entity2 tablet with camera be enough to persuade millions of @entity5 users to upgrade ? are there other bells and whistles we do n't know about yet ? we have previously reported on rumors that the new device will have an sd card slot , and that it will feature rear - facing and front - facing cameras			1

we 'll know when @entity2 's acting ceo @entity83 takes the stage , if this product timeline is accurate , in a few months ' time			0

the @entity5 2 might have a front - facing camera , enabling use of the @entity53 app
there are rumors that the new device will have an @entity97 slot
nearly $ 5 billion worth of @entity17 have been sold in the three quarters since its launch
