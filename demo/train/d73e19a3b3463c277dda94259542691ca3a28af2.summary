as @entity1 struggles with a massive debt crisis , a top congressional investigator has questions about the island government 's decision to nullify an agreement that would have returned about $ 230 million in overpaid taxes to a major bank			1
@entity10 chairman @entity9 sent a letter last month to @entity1 gov. @entity12 asking for a briefing on his administration 's decision to unilaterally nullify the agreement between the @entity17 , known as @entity18 , and @entity19 , the second largest mortgage provider on the island			1
@entity21 has said the @entity23 administration 's decision to pull out of the agreement could hurt its financial condition			0
because @entity19 's deposits are insured by the @entity27 , @entity9 wrote that the @entity1 @entity29 's " actions place federal dollars ... at risk			1
" " to enable the committee to better understand the nature of this risk , and the consequences of @entity18 's actions , i respectfully request that appropriate @entity1 administration officials provide a briefing to committee staff , " @entity9 wrote			1
@entity41 's letter ( @entity42 ) @entity9 's letter comes as @entity21 battles @entity1 for a $ 230 million tax refund it says it 's owed			1
after @entity1 decided not to refund the money , the @entity27 essentially told the bank it could no longer count the $ 230 million toward its capital requirements			2
deadline imposed the regulator gave the bank 120 days to find other ways to meet its capital requirements or face possible sale , merger or liquidation			0
an @entity10 aide said that one of the questions the @entity59 @entity58 wants answered is whether the @entity27 would have to expend federal taxpayer money in the event the bank liquidates and is n't able to make all its depositors whole			2
the @entity27 declined to comment			0
for its part , the @entity65 governor 's office argues that the agreement , signed under a previous administration , is null because @entity21 's supporting paperwork did not prove that the bank had overpaid its taxes			2
just last week , debt rater @entity71 downgraded the @entity75 territory 's credit rating further into junk status -- a theme @entity21 hit in a statement to @entity79			0
" the government 's decision to nullify its agreement with @entity21 was unexpected , " the bank said , and " comes at the very time that the island teeters on financial insolvency			0
nevertheless , the government 's financial situation should have no bearing on its willingness to fulfill its obligation to honor a legally binding agreement with @entity21 or any other business			0
" in the statement , @entity21 spokeswoman @entity93 said while bank officials had not seen @entity9 's letter , " we believe that an inquiry from the chairman and his committee represents a significant step in making the government of @entity1 accountable for its troubling behavior in this case			1
" @entity104 , a spokeswoman for the governor 's administration , said in a statement that the @entity17 determined there had been no overpayment and @entity21 's allegations " are without merit			0
" " @entity21 's financial situation was not caused by the @entity1 , and its regulatory issues began many years before the @entity29 's determination to nullify the 2012 closing agreement , " she said , adding that administration officials are working with @entity9 's staff to provide the information he requested .			2
