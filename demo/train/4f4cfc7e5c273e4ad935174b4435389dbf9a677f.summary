authorities were never able to find the nanny			0
but they did find @entity22 , who claimed she never met @entity13 or her daughter			1
@entity22 's attorneys claim , according to questions asked of @entity13 in the october 8 deposition , that @entity22 was questioned by the police in @entity2 's disappearance , was kicked out of her apartment complex , lost her job and that she and her two daughters received death threats as a result of media attention in the case			1

however , @entity12 did not permit her to answer questions including whether she had ever met @entity23 ; whether a person named @entity22 was ever a nanny to @entity2 ; or whether defense attorney @entity48 's assertion during @entity13 's criminal trial , that @entity22 was one of @entity13 's " imaginary friends , " was true			1
she also was not allowed to answer questions about whether she considered herself a good mother to @entity2 ; the last day she saw the 2 - year - old alive ; and whether she drowned in the @entity54 ' pool in june 2008 , as the defense claimed during @entity13 's criminal trial			2
asked why he was invoking @entity13 's right against self - incrimination , @entity12 said , according to the transcript , " i need not explain our factual basis other than to tell you that it could tend to incriminate and provide a link in the chain of evidence that could be used against ( @entity13 )			2
" asked by @entity22 's attorney @entity66 what pending criminal case that applies to , @entity12 said , " we made our objection and that 's all i 'm going to state			2
" @entity66 told @entity12 he anticipates a hearing before a judge on a motion to compel @entity13 to answer some of these questions			2
@entity12 said that taking it to a judge is " the best thing to do			0

the transcript of the deposition notes that @entity13 participated via videoconference from " an undisclosed location			0
" " i hope that you and your counsel understand that we did not ask questions that many people may have wished we did concerning your employment history then or now , where you live , where you stay , " @entity66 told @entity13 as questioning wrapped up			0
