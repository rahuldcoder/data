-- pope @entity1 celebrated his first @entity2 with departures from the style of his predecessor even as he delivered a traditional call for peace			1
while it 's traditional for the pope to deliver a message of peace on @entity12 , his direct interactions with the crowd reinforced stylistic differences between him and the austere , distant approach of @entity17 , observers said			1
barely two weeks since his election , the first @entity19 pope celebrated @entity2 from an outdoor altar in the presence of tens of thousands of followers in @entity24			1
dressed in white , unadorned vestments consistent with his modest image , @entity1 celebrated @entity2 alone , without his cardinals			1
after @entity2 , he made his way through @entity24 in an open - top popemobile free of bulletproof glass so he could stop to greet followers with handshakes , embraces and kisses			1
in his first @entity35 blessing from the papal balcony , @entity1 called for an end to conflicts in the @entity39 and the @entity40			2
he also called for peace for @entity42 -- both those devastated by violence in the country and refugees in need of help -- and harmony in the troubled @entity51 nations of @entity52 and the @entity53			0
five things to know about @entity1 but while the world scrutinizes his every move , papal observers said it was too early to make judgments about how he intends to lead the @entity60			1
" @entity17 and @entity1 are like @entity64 and @entity65 -- the style is different but the songs are the same , " said @entity61 , news director and lead anchor of @entity63			2
what 's clear for now , @entity61 said , is that @entity1 " is intent on bringing the message of the church out to the world , " as he demonstrated sunday throughout @entity72			1
when he told his priests thursday " to go look for the lost sheep , " he added that when they come back , they " better smell like those sheep , " @entity61 said			0
" he wants them amid the people in the muck of life			0
" the pope was elected almost three weeks ago , succeeding @entity17			2
a former @entity82 cardinal , he became the first @entity84 pope of the modern era , the first from @entity19 , the first @entity87 and the first to assume the name @entity1			1
already , @entity1 has repeatedly veered from tradition			1
three days ago , on @entity90 , he went to a youth detention center in @entity92 -- rather than the city 's chief cathedral -- and washed the feet of a dozen young detainees			0
among the group at the @entity98 were two females and two @entity100			0
the pontiff poured water over the young offenders ' feet , wiped them with a white towel and kissed them			0
in his homily , given to about 50 young offenders , he said everyone should help one another			0
" as a priest and as a bishop , i should be at your service			0
it is a duty that comes from my heart , " he said			0
the act of foot - washing is part of the @entity120 tradition that mirrors @entity122 ' washing of his disciples ' feet			2
@entity1 ' decision to include two females -- an @entity127 and an @entity128 -- in the ceremony disturbed some traditionalists , who believe the 12 people should reflect the 12 male apostles			1
the @entity133 responded friday to " questions and concerns " related to the pope 's washing the young offenders ' feet , calling it a " simple and spontaneous gesture of love , affection , forgiveness and mercy			2
" if anything , @entity1 ' outreach to women , along with his emphasis on " reinvigorating the @entity120 faith " in parts of the world " where secularism has the upper hand " continues the tradition of @entity17 and popes before him , said author and theologian @entity155 , a senior fellow of the @entity157 for biblical theology			1
" that hallmark of humility and simplicity are his personal expressions as pope , " @entity155 said			0
" there is something wonderfully new about him , but he 's also maintaining the teachings of the church in wonderful continuity with the popes who 've gone before him			0
" @entity0 's @entity170 contributed to this report .			0

pope @entity1 continues to distinguish himself from predecessor in first @entity2
@entity60 from around the world pack @entity24 for @entity1 ' message
in his few weeks as pope , @entity1 has veered from tradition several times
some questioned @entity1 ' decision to wash the feet of two females during @entity72
