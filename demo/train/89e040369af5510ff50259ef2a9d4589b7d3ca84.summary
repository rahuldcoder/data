-- for some fans , tailgating is something to do before a football game			1
for others , a football game is something to do after tailgating			1
it 's a religion at various schools , complete with copious amounts of food , games and flat - screen tvs			1
even though the weather is cooling off , tailgating season is still heating up			1
we 're months away from the beginning of the @entity18 , which begins on january 1 with the @entity19 and ends on january 10 with the @entity20			0
until then , the best college programs in the country are still fighting for a spot in one of the highly competitive bowl games			1
and the fans are there every game , diligently camped out for hours -- sometimes days -- to show their support for the home team			1
@entity0 , with the help of experts at @entity34 , chose five football programs with top tailgating institutions worth a trip			1
@entity38 -- @entity39 , @entity40 tailgating is of prime importance at @entity43 , and the ritual continues throughout generations of @entity47 fans			1
" it 's a tradition we want to pass down to our children , " says @entity48 , the creator of @entity49			1
" we want them to see the camaraderie and spirit that 's centered around the game			1
" @entity48 has been tailgating in the same spot before every home game for 19 years			1
he and his companions prepare everything from fried shrimp to whole pigs to white chili , changing the menu with every game			0
" people in @entity40 take very seriously our food and our football , " says @entity66 , a football reporter for @entity67 , @entity39 's newspaper			1
" @entity41 is a perfect opportunity to wed those two seven or eight times a year			0
" the tailgate begins on thursday night for some diehard fans			1
motor homes descend upon @entity39 and surround the stadium , setting up camp for the weekend			0
season parking sells out quickly , but some spots are available on a game - by - game basis			0
walking through the tailgate area offers some of the benefits of actually tailgating			1
you 'll smell smoke -- either hickory or mesquite -- and bourbon , and if you 're lucky , you 'll get invited to partake in a tailgate already in progress			1
" we try to invite the visiting teams to our tailgate as they stroll by , because eventually we 'll be going to their campuses , " @entity48 says			1
" you hope you meet somebody who will reciprocate			0
" a few hours before the game begins , @entity96 houses a procession for the team and coaches			0
fans press in on both sides , cheering the team as it heads to the stadium			2
" it 's a @entity40 thing , " @entity104 says			2
" people love to have their parties			0
it can be a football game			0
it can be if the sun comes up two days in a row			0
@entity113 is the heart and soul for a lot of people , and they love to combine an eating party and football			0
" check out other great destinations and tips at five to go 2			0
@entity122 -- @entity123 , @entity124 there are two types of tailgates taking place at @entity123 , though both have the same goal in mind			1
" there 's the students who do it in their front yards , then there 's the people who get in their rvs and drive from all over the @entity141 and make a whole weekend out of it , " says @entity132 , a sports reporter for the @entity133			2
" it 's not just a game here			2
it 's a cultural happening			2
" as soon as classes let out on friday , people begin marking their tailgating areas to claim a spot for the game			2
@entity151 , director of university communications for @entity123 , estimates that 20,000 or so people show up on game weekends with no intention of actually going to the game			1
@entity132 says the atmosphere gives off an " oddly familial vibe for a college tailgating scene			2
" even if the @entity160 , @entity123 's biggest rival , is the visiting team , the @entity47 tailgaters invite the opposing fans to come to their cookouts , @entity151 says			1
fans can expect to find lots of barbecue and souped up @entity140 , complete with fully functioning entertainment systems for watching the pre-game coverage and other college football games			1
two hours before the start of a game , the team arrives on buses and walks through the thousands of people lining the street toward the stadium -- a practice that , due to its popularity , takes place at away games as well			1
" i do n't think there 's a better place to tailgate and a better atmosphere for college football than right here at @entity123 , " @entity151 says			1
" i think away teams would agree			2
@entity186 -- @entity187 , @entity188 though independent of a conference , @entity186 is steeped in football tradition , and , along with it , tailgating tradition			1
it 's smaller than many @entity195 and @entity196 schools , but @entity186 sees a surge of people on campus for game day			2
" we have a fairly small student body -- maybe 10,000 people , " says @entity201 , a football beat writer and assistant managing editor for @entity205 , @entity186 's student newspaper			1
" but on game days there are as many as 100,000 people on campus			0
" game day really kicks off at midnight on friday with the @entity214 , when the drum line plays through the cheers at the @entity217 on campus			0
even before that , however , people are lined up taking pictures of @entity222 , a nickname given to the @entity224 painted on the side of the @entity226			0
" @entity222 has both of his arms raised , " @entity201 says			0
" it looks like he 's signaling a touchdown			2
" starting at 8 a.m. on saturday , the band plays continually around campus			0
the players attend @entity234 and are cheered on by fans on their walk from the basilica to the stadium			2
many of the pre-game rituals take place around campus , with tailgating interspersed throughout the town			2
" @entity186 is such a legacy school , " @entity201 says			0
" i have friends that are third or fourth generation graduates			2
... tradition is so ingrained in @entity186 football that it kind of carries over to the tailgating			1
@entity251 -- @entity252 , @entity253 the scenery of @entity253 adds a unique element to the @entity257 ' tailgating experience : fans can spend their time on the water before a game			1
" you can actually tie up to a dock that 's a few blocks from the stadium , " says @entity262 , a @entity253 alumnus			2
" people take big charter boats that can hold several hundred people or they have their own boats			0
" tailgaters cook out and make drinks on their boats , interacting with other boaters close by			0
some do n't fare as well on the water as others			2
" every year , during at least one game , somebody will fall into the water , " @entity262 says			2
" nobody gets hurt ... but that 's a sight to see			2
" when it 's close to game time , shuttle boats pick up fans that are tied up to buoys and transport them to the docks , which are within short walking distance to the stadium			1
of course , there are dry land tailgaters as well -- in greater numbers than the ones using boats			0
" it 's more of an adult crowd than you would find at a lot of schools , " says @entity296 , a football reporter for the @entity297			0
" about 7,000 students get tickets to every game out of about 70,000 fans			0
" hundreds of rvs are set up in parking lots , where , weather permitting , fans grill out and play typical tailgating games			1
" the @entity251 , compared to other @entity313 schools , is definitely regarded as having one of the most intense and passionate fan bases , " @entity296 says			1
@entity316 -- @entity317 , @entity318 @entity317 , @entity318 , is a small town smack dab in the middle of the state			0
surrounded by fields and fields of farmland , @entity323 's grounds make room for plenty of tailgating			1
" if you were at @entity335 and looked out toward the farms , you 'd just see cars and cars and cars of tailgaters , " says @entity330 , a football beat reporter for @entity333 , @entity323 's student newspaper			0
though @entity317 has a population of just under 40,000 , the stadium seats more than 100,000 , packing the fields with fans			0
" there 's a certain escape that comes with the workweek ending , coming up here on a fall weekend and parking in the middle of a grass field to set up your tailgate , " says @entity345 , associate athletic director for marketing and communications at @entity323			1
alumni , students and families make home contests into a weekend event , full of games , cheers and food			1
" i think if it goes on the grill , it 's fair game , " @entity345 says			0
" we 're seeing food that at least psychologically is making people stay warmer if they eat it			0
" the team arrives at @entity335 about an hour and a half before every game , and the quarterback is always the first off the bus			0
the sound of cowbell clinks alternates with resounding cheers of " @entity382 ! " @entity345 says that walking through the fields of tailgaters shows him how committed the fans are to the program and the traditions			0
" the amount of prep put into a tailgate is a real statement as to how they feel about the experience , " @entity345 says			0
" we do n't want to lose sight of that or diminish the value of it			0
how they tailgate outside is a reflection of how they feel about @entity323 inside			0
