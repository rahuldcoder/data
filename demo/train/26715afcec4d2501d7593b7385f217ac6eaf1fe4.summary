-- sen. @entity1 said friday he does n't want to " create panic " over @entity3 , but stood by his belief that the virus is more contagious that the government is letting on			1
" i understand people in government not wanting to create panic , and i do n't want to create panic , either			1
but i think it 's also a mistake on the other side of the coin to underplay the risk of this , " the @entity12 @entity11 told @entity0 's @entity13 in an interview to air in full on " @entity16 " at 5 p.m. et. last week @entity1 , an ophthalmologist with a medical degree from @entity24 , expressed strong skepticism of the @entity28 administration 's handling of @entity3			1
he called for the government to consider suspending flights to and from @entity3 hot zones in @entity32			1
while flight changes have not been implemented , the government is starting to enforce closer screenings of @entity36 at five of @entity38 's busiest airports			0
doubling down on his stance , @entity1 said he thinks temporary flight suspensions would be practical			1
" i mean , if you want to visit your son or daughter and you 're coming from @entity44 , could n't you wait a couple of months ? i do n't think that that is something so -- of such an immediate necessity that the chance for a worldwide contagion , i think it 's not unreasonable , " he said			2
@entity53 director on @entity3 : ' only thing like this has been @entity56 ' president @entity28 has said the likelihood of an @entity3 epidemic in the @entity38 is small , and the @entity53 has maintained that the virus can only be transmitted through bodily fluids			1
" the administration has been saying over and over again , ' oh , this is only transmitted through direct bodily fluids			0
' they make you think that this is like @entity56 and not very contagious			0
and then in the next statement , they very quietly say , ' oh , but if you 're within three feet of someone , we call that direct contact			0
' well i do n't think @entity38 think standing within three feet of someone is direct contact , " he said			0
@entity38 @entity3 survivor not sure of source infection the @entity53 defines close contact as being within three feet of a patient for a prolonged period of time , or having direct brief contact , such as shaking hands and hugging			2
walking by a person or moving through a hospital does not comprise contact , the @entity53 says			0
however , on @entity0 , @entity53 director dr. @entity86 said that if a person had been coughed on or sneezed on by an @entity3 patient , medical professionals would want to " look at that situation very closely			2
" " they also say it ca n't be aerosolized , " @entity1 said friday			1
" but the question people should be asking is , ' can it be transmitted by someone coughing on you ? ' i think the virus can be suspended in cough particles			1
they call that direct contact			0
but i think most @entity38 would think that 's being aerosolized			0
