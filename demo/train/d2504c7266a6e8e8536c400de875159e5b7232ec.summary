-- the other day i was engaged in a rather thoughtful conversation with one of my @entity0 co-workers , an @entity5 - educated , award - winning journalist who 's admired for her compassion and charm			1
she asked me to fart			1
now , i do n't want to embarrass this individual by sharing her name , but it was definitely @entity12			1
the conversation went like this			1
@entity12 : " i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , but i sort of want you to do it			1
) me : " how 's that for you ? " @entity12 : " no ! you did n't ! " me : " oh , i did			1
" @entity12 : " really ? seriously ? i ca n't smell a thing			1
" we give each other high fives			1
you see , i was wearing @entity23 , a new flatulence - filtering underwear that recently made news all over the @entity26			1
it was actually trending several weeks ago , and i was hoping to write about the product then , while it was still a big talker online			1
however , i 'm a serious journalist with literally hours of experience , and i felt it just was n't enough to simply mention that these things exist			2
i had to actually try them out			2
so they shipped me a fresh pair from the @entity36			1
at least i hope they were fresh			2
either way , they 're not now			2
and after a three - day trial run on tuesday , wednesday and thursday of this week , it 's finally time for a serious conversation about farts			1
which is great , because it 's basically my beat			2
" we 've got breaking fart news ! @entity51 , you need to fly to @entity52 right away			1
" " will this assignment require pants ? " so , yeah , we 're talking about farts			2
and i apologize for nothing			2
in fact , if you think this topic is gross or lowbrow , just consider some words by @entity61			2
in june , while speaking to an audience in @entity63 , he explained that , at our core , all people are the same			2
and then he shared this wonderful anecdote			2
" when in aeroplane , sometimes this gas problem comes , " he said			2
" then , you see , it is difficult to let out			0
so , occasionally , you see , look around , then you go like that			0
" his holiness leaned over to the side as though he was letting out a big ripper and then proceeded to laugh like a 12 - year - old boy			1
the product shreddies were invented by a @entity36 industrial designer named @entity84 , and the name comes from a colloquial term used for underwear that originated with the @entity88			1
i was told that soldiers would literally shred their underwear from marching so much			1
but these @entity23 are nothing like the worn and torn undies that the name suggests			0
or the ones i bought from @entity95 in 2003 , which are still clinging to life			0
here , @entity84 actually worked with lingerie designers from @entity99 's lingerie design course ( where the hell was this when i was in college ? ) and utilized something called @entity103 , an activated carbon cloth that has traditionally been used in chemical warfare suits			1
so , basically , it 's like attaching a military - strength @entity107 to your butt			1
though you definitely do n't want to try this at home unless you long for an awkward conversation at the emergency room			0
" ... and that 's how it happened			0
" " sir , i 'm not a doctor			0
" but there does n't appear to be anything bulky or dangerous about this @entity123 cloth , which is perfectly comfortable , sewn naturally right into the rear of the underwear			1
and as you release gas , the stink particles -- that 's a technical term -- get trapped in the magic science filter , allowing you to confidently eat all sorts of horrible things and fart in the company of friends and strangers			0
which is exactly what i did			0
the experiment @entity141 started out like any other : sad and mired in self doubt			0
but after peeling myself out of bed , i made some coffee , had a banana and drank down some dark chocolate almond milk before leaving for the office			1
this would be my standard breakfast throughout the experiment , a more or less healthy start to the day			0
everything else was pure terror			0
we 're talking pizza and tacos and soda			0
and when all that was n't working , i thought , " @entity159 , a heaping pile of roast beef ought to do it			0
but , how was i to know if the @entity23 were actually working ? this experiment needed a control			0
so , i did what absolutely had to be done			0
( pause for completely unrelated question : why do n't women like me ? ) now , for the sake of the more puritanical among our audience , i wo n't go into too many more details			0
just know that the experiment was working and , over the next two and a half days , i would continue this aggressive line of eating , consuming everything from shepherd 's pie to a dank , soupy bowl of cheap fast food chili			0
all in the name of journalism			0
and here 's the end result : these things work			1
i put @entity23 through the ultimate endurance test , and they lived up to their promise			0
and @entity12 was right there to back me up			0
" i ca n't say i 've ever asked someone to fart for me , and i 'm not particularly proud that i did , " she said			0
" but someone had to fact - check what @entity194 was doing			1
thankfully , those undies work			1
" i apologize for nothing			0
follow @ @entity198 on @entity199 .			0
