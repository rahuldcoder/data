-- the video of @entity2 knocking his then - fiancee @entity4 unconscious and then dragging her body out of an elevator brought the topic of domestic violence to the nation 's attention			1
unfortunately , the series of events in this case -- the initial abuse , then the victim - blaming , and the @entity17 's response -- is not unique to the hyper - masculine culture of the @entity17 , but is a microcosm of what occurs in our society more broadly			1
i have seen this far too often in my work specializing in domestic violence law			2
what the nation saw in the video of @entity2 's abuse happens every day in @entity31			1
in our country , one - in - three high school girls and women experience intimate partner violence , according to the @entity37			1
that is : one - third of our female population experiences untold physical , psychological , and developmental harm			0
stated another way , domestic abuse occurs at rates higher than the combined number of automobile accidents , stranger rapes , and muggings that women experience			2
@entity51 's experience is not really sensational or extraordinary , it is ordinary			1
she has asked the public to leave her family alone , but we do n't have to talk about her to talk about domestic violence			0
instead , we could talk about my client whose husband called 911 saying , " i think i 've killed my wife			0
" he was an elementary school teacher , not a professional athlete or celebrity , so there was no media coverage of the severe injuries he inflicted or the five - year jail sentence he received after nearly killing his wife			0
we could talk about another client whose boyfriend ( now husband ) burned her with a scalding hot iron , permanently scarring her arm , and later tried to run her over with his car			0
or we could talk about my many clients who have been raped , beaten unconscious , and otherwise brutalized by their intimate partners			0
and this is only the physical abuse ; emotional and psychological abuse often inflict deeper harm			0
nor is the @entity17 's permissive , slow , and underwhelming response to domestic violence unusual in our country			2
sadly , our society and legal systems have largely failed to prevent or respond to intimate partner violence			1
historically , as long as a husband did n't kill or maim his wife , he would not be prosecuted			0
during the 1800s and 1900s , legal doctrine gave the husband the right of chastisement over his wife and immunity for marital rape			0
laws against domestic violence are recent and it was n't until the mid- 1990s that each state had protection order laws			1
even with laws in place , police and prosecutors are frequently slow to act , and by the time an abuse survivor seeks police or court intervention , he or she has typically experienced repeated and severe abuse			2
the question of how to prevent abuse persists			0
to prevent domestic violence , we must grapple with the causes of violence and the societal forces that condone and perpetuate abuse			1
gender inequality and masculine norms of dominance , toughness , and control chiefly contribute to the continuation of abuse			1
the other major factor is the intergenerational effect of domestic violence , with research showing that witnessing abuse between one 's parents is the strongest risk factor for transmitting abusive behavior across generations			1
i can respect that @entity51 does not wish to be tokenized or become a national spokesperson			2
let 's instead have a larger conversation about prevention and intervention in our domestic violence epidemic .			0

@entity143 : the abuse @entity51 suffered not extraordinary in @entity31 it 's *painfully* ordinary
1 in 3 teen girls , women suffer partner violence . @entity143 sees many grim cases in her law practice
only since ' 90s have all states had protection order laws . abuse long tolerated , she says
@entity143 : @entity31 must grapple with causes : male domination , gender inequality , violence seen in home
