just a month into the year , and already the role of extremism in the @entity4 faith has been at the center of heated debate			1
but while the attack on the office of satirical magazine @entity10 in @entity11 garnered most of the international headlines , another argument has been simmering much closer to home -- one that all of us should be engaged in			0
unfortunately , it 's also one that many might be tempted to sweep under the rug			0
earlier this month , @entity19 , in @entity20 , said it would allow the @entity22 call to prayer to play via the chapel bell tower 's speaker system for the weekly friday prayer service			1
unfortunately , what should have been seen as an inclusive gesture not only sparked controversy , but was met with outright hostility by critics , including some who tried to suggest the move was an attack on liberty and the call to prayer was somehow tied to terrorism			1
leading the charge toward this deliberate ignorance was the rev. @entity41 , son of renowned evangelist @entity42			0
the younger @entity42 used the announcement as another opportunity to attack @entity4			1
reacting to @entity19 's decision on @entity46 , he wrote : " as @entity47 is being excluded from the public square and followers of @entity4 are raping , butchering , and beheading @entity50 , jews , and anyone who does n't submit to their @entity53 , @entity19 is promoting this in the name of religious pluralism			1
" of course , it is undeniable that some @entity22 butcher others in the name of @entity4			1
but there are also @entity50 who do the same in the name of @entity63			0
and one need not even look as far back as the atrocities committed during the crusades or the colonization of @entity68 , which claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands			0
the @entity71 in @entity72 , for example , specifically cites its @entity47 faith as inspiration for the group 's terrorism			0
or what about @entity78 , who in 2011 killed 77 people in @entity80 , after writing a 1,500 - page manifesto citing @entity47 inspiration for his slaughter ? and it 's not even simply a question of whether @entity4 or @entity47 has inspired more brutality			1
many might be surprised to learn that @entity88 , seen by many in the @entity90 as a particularly peaceful faith , has seen adherents terrorize @entity22			0
in @entity94 , the last couple of years have seen hundreds of @entity22 killed , and many thousands more displaced , in attacks by extremist @entity88 and monks			0
by @entity41 's logic on @entity4 , then , all adherents should be judged according to the very worst acts committed in the name of their faith			1
but it is interesting that it is @entity4 that seems to be singled out for the most venomous treatment			1
sadly , @entity42 is only one among a host of religious and social representatives who have for years been expending their energy on misleading those who look up to them for guidance			0
true , following the september 11 attacks , @entity0 quoted @entity42 as arguing that " it was a small group of people who are bent on the destruction of this country , those @entity4 fundamentalists that need to be stopped			2
so i plead with people not to paint in a broad brush , so to speak , the people of the @entity119			0
" but the report goes on to note that he appeared to backtrack from this moderate view , adding that he was quoted just a month later as arguing : " the god of @entity4 is not the same @entity125 of the @entity47 or the @entity127 - @entity47 faith			2
it is a different god , and i believe @entity4 is a very evil and a very wicked religion			2
" he was also later quoted by @entity0 as suggesting " true @entity4 " means being able to " beat your wife " and " murder your children if they 've committed adultery or something like that , which they do practice in these other countries			2
" all this suggests that @entity142 is either an ignorant man who knows next to nothing about a faith that he holds forth on as if an expert , or ( even worse ) he intentionally tries to mislead @entity50 into despising @entity4 and @entity22			2
regardless of whether it is either of these factors , having spent half my life in the deep and concerted study of @entity4 , i know for certain that @entity142 's claims are without merit			1
still , if @entity142 truly believes he has truth on his side , then he should be willing to engage in a public debate on the question of extremism in @entity4			1
and as someone who has faith in those who follow the @entity161 , whom i love and adore , i would be happy to engage in such a dialogue and exchange of ideas			0
whether or not @entity142 agrees to this opportunity to dialogue , of course , remains to be seen .			0
