@entity0 -- the air we breathe in the @entity4 is getting better -- at least by one recent measure			2
new data released by @entity7 this week show that at least one pollutant , nitrogen dioxide , has decreased substantially over the past decade			1
areas with a high level of nitrogen dioxide have decreased an average of about 40 % , said @entity14 , an atmospheric scientist at @entity7 's @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
" it happened everywhere , not just in a few areas			0
it 's over the whole country			0
so this is a real success story for everyone in the @entity4 , " he said			0
the decrease is particularly prominent in the crowded @entity26 , the @entity27 , and some major cities			0
for example , @entity7 reported a 32 % decrease in @entity31 and a 42 % decrease in @entity33 between the periods of 2005 - 2007 and 2009 - 2011			1
@entity14 attributes the decrease to two factors : cars that are more efficient , and scrubbers on smokestack emissions that remove toxins			1
" it means fewer hospital admissions , it means fewer emergency room visits , it means fewer doctor visits , " said @entity41 , assistant vice president of the @entity42			2
man - made sources emit an estimated 19.4 million metric tons of nitrogen oxides a year in the @entity4 , produced primarily by vehicles and by coal - fired power plants , according to the @entity42			1
nitrogen dioxide is a yellow - brown gas that can cause respiratory problems like coughing , asthma , and trouble breathing			1
it is one of six common air pollutants for which the @entity60 has set limits			0
@entity41 , who produces an annual report called @entity63 , pointed out that these pollutants are a separate concern from greenhouse gases , which are blamed for climate change , and were not measured in this report			1
and , she said , over 140 million @entity4 still live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution , according to the @entity60			0
" we have about half the nation who lives in counties that have unhealthy levels of air pollution , " said @entity41			0
" and what we 're learning is , levels that we thought were safe were not , and we need to clean up even more , to provide real protection			0
we still have a long way to go			2
" the @entity80 in april upheld an @entity60 rule intended to further reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide that blow across state lines			1
the decrease cited in the @entity7 study is particularly prominent in the crowded @entity26 , the @entity27 , and some major cities			2
for example , @entity7 reported a 32 percent decrease in @entity31 and a 42 percent decrease in @entity33 between the periods of 2005 - 2007 and 2009 - 2011			2

" we still have a long way to go , " says @entity42 *official*
@entity7 data show substantial decreases in nitrogen dioxide
@entity7 scientists attributes reductions to more - efficient cars , smokestack emissions cuts
nitrogen dioxide is separate from greenhouse gases , which were *n't* measured in this report
