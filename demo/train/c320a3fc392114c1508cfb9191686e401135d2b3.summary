disturbing reports are emerging from @entity1 that a 10 - year - old girl named @entity3 was pre-empted from carrying out a suicide bombing attack against a police station in @entity6			1
though @entity9 forces are already deploying female operatives in a limited capacity , it was the first report of a young girl who was groomed for martyrdom			1
it represents the latest development in a long history of terrorist organizations ' use of children			2
@entity21 reports suggest the girl is the sister of a @entity9 commander			1
indeed multiple @entity26 groups specifically recruit within their own families			2
in @entity29 and @entity30 , we have seen sisters , brothers and cousins involved in terrorist operations , sometimes together			0
in both @entity1 and @entity36 , various @entity9 units have engaged in targeted recruitment of pairs of siblings			1
in our research over the past year into children being groomed for terrorist activity in @entity36 , several of the youth we encountered undergoing de-radicalization and preparation for reintegration via the @entity48 facility ( @entity36 's rehabilitation facility for child militants ) were recruited by relatives in the @entity36 @entity9			1
in almost all cases we have studied , the child recruits were genuinely unaware of what they were being asked to do -- what such operations could entail			0
those who were aware displayed serious hesitation and were often given drugs by their recruiters to help them to comply			0
some of the children changed their minds at the last minute and thus found refuge at @entity48			2
duping children into carrying out a suicide attack is not a new tactic			1
in june 2007 in the southern @entity1 province of @entity67 , the @entity9 failed to deceive a 6 - year - old boy , @entity68 , into being a suicide bomber			1
putting the vest on him , the @entity9 repeatedly told him that " flowers and food would appear once he pressed the button			1
" walking toward his target , @entity68 hesitated			0
he decided not to press the button and instead called out for help from nearby @entity80 soldiers , who deactivated the device on his body			0
the incident was a watershed			0
@entity86 , the chief administrator for @entity68 's village of @entity88 , brought the boy and his brother to meet with the village elders , who expressed strong disapproval of the tactic and even began cooperating with @entity95 forces to weed out the @entity9			1
incidents such as these would appear to indicate that @entity9 fighters are adopting the strategies of @entity101 insurgents , who have been known to use children to disguise bomb - laden vehicles or dupe drivers into carrying improvised explosive devices , or @entity106 , at times without their knowledge			1
in those cases , the would - be bombers are detonated by remote control			2
this week 's report of the attempted attack did not include a remote control detonator , and the 10 - year - old girl was unsuccessful in executing the mission of those who deployed her			1
@entity1 security forces , however , have long been aware of this particularly insidious tactic			1
@entity9 spokesman @entity120 has denied the group used child fighters , disclosing at the time of the @entity68 incident that the @entity9 had hundreds of adults ready for suicide missions			1
" we do n't need to use a child , " he said			0
" it 's against @entity132 law , it 's against humanitarian law			0
this is just propaganda against the @entity9			2
" such statements are easily disputed			0
for example , in the publicly released documents seized from his @entity139 , @entity36 , compound , @entity136 acknowledged that " most of the work in @entity1 ( has ) turned to the goal of luring and preparing the youth			2
" more recently , in november , there were media reports that @entity1 police had pre-empted a 12 - year - old bomber in the @entity149 district of @entity150 ; the child was allegedly wearing an explosive vest en route to a local girls ' school			1
when children are forced into terrorism , they become victimized and traumatized by their experiences in the process			2
in turn , they exploit and victimize others			0
many remain in the movement until adulthood and beyond			0
and it 's not just in their home countries : efforts to groom children and adolescents as a future generation of militants has also been uncovered in diaspora communities within the @entity173 and the @entity174			2
perhaps the most well - known case in recent times has been the disappearance of some 17 @entity179 - @entity173 adolescent boys and young men from @entity181			0
@entity182 , former director - general of the @entity183 , or @entity183 , warned that @entity184 is targeting vulnerable youth -- even the very young -- in such communities as terrorist recruits , underscoring the need to protect children everywhere from exposure to violent extremism			1
@entity182 explained : " they are ( radicalizing ) , indoctrinating and grooming young , vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism			0
this year , we have seen individuals as young as 15 and 16 implicated in terrorist - related activity			2
" such realities pose serious challenges to countering violent extremism , especially when most efforts today place firm emphasis on undermining the allure of troublesome ideologies			0
most of the children are not recruited on ideological grounds , and in cases where some children do appear to be under some ideological influence , it is clear they do not understand it			0
whether for children recruited by the @entity36 @entity9 , or young @entity215 recruited in @entity181 , there is a critical role to be played by families and communities in protecting young children from being vulnerable to the clutches of violent extremists			1
these efforts can not be limited to a frame of counterterrorism			0
this is a challenge of basic child protection .			0

***writers*** : reports of 10 - year - girl in @entity1 intent on suicide bombing is a first
not *unusual* for children to be groomed for martyrdom , they say , but @entity9 deny practice
***writers*** : children are often in the dark about their *assignments*
***writers*** : families , communities must guard against children falling under sway of extremists
