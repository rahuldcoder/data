-- dressed in a pink uniform , midwife @entity1 shuffles past rows of beds to check on the five babies she delivered the night before inside a small health center in rural eastern @entity7			1
lying underneath a sky blue mosquito net , a newborn girl wrapped in a white sheet tries to stretch her tiny body as @entity1 slowly approaches			1
" @entity1 is there , " says the midwife , pointing to the baby girl resting next to her mother			1
" @entity18 -- they gave the baby my names , all my names , because yesterday it was born on my birthday , " she continues , with a smile on her face			0

' the pain was too much ; she walked for a long distance and she thought the baby was dying			0
" read this : flying doctor takes to the skies pain medication is a rare luxury in the small village of @entity37 so @entity1 had to rely on one special treatment to help the woman bring her baby to life			2
" i gave her ' verbocain , ' " says @entity1			2
" you know ' verbocain ' is the only drug we can give them in @entity49 , " she explains ironically			2
" ' @entity50 ' -- you verbally talk to the mother ; giving her just consoling words and patting her , rubbing her back , until she gave birth			0
" ' @entity56 ' @entity1 is well known here as a midwife who has a very good record of saving both mothers and babies during difficult deliveries			1
but her reputation extends far beyond eastern @entity7			2
since 2011 , @entity1 has become the poster girl for all of @entity49 's midwives , fronting an international campaign to highlight the plights of mothers and babies on the continent			1
called " @entity77 , " the initiative by the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) aims to ensure that all pregnant women throughout @entity49 have access to trained midwives to ensure a reduction in high maternal mortality rates			1

" it is just a campaign which is creating awareness that there is death , maternal mortality rate which is high in @entity49 ; mothers are dying ; babies are dying			1
the solution should be , we train midwives , " she says			2
devotion like many maternity clinics in rural parts of @entity49 , the health center in @entity37 is lacking several necessary resources -- shortage of running water , electricity challenges , broken beds and scarcity of medicines all make @entity1 's job very difficult			1
but despite the challenges , the midwife extraordinaire remains devoted to her patients			0
a mother of two , @entity1 has chosen to live hours away from her family to be able to cater to the women that need her			1
" i opted to give my children to my mother , not because i do n't love them , " she says			0
" i love my children but because i could not have time for them , to cook for them , take care of them , because of my tight schedule of duties			0
" read this : one woman 's mission to fix water crisis @entity1 can completely identify with the fears of the mothers she helps			1
soon after becoming a midwife , she suffered herself the cruel experience of losing a child			0

" it was a terrible condition for me ; it was psychological torture , because a midwife losing a baby ? and yet i 'm the one saving other babies , " she adds			0
" it was terrible and i said ' no mother should lose a baby ; i 'll try my level best , i will improvise , whatever i can , so long as i have the knowledge to save that woman and her baby			0
' " and that 's what she 's been doing ever since , working tirelessly to ensure that mothers get the right treatment during pregnancy and child birth			2
she is optimistic that the " @entity187 " campaign will create much needed awareness of the plights of the people she 's helping			0
" we hope to create a future where no baby is left alone , where no mother dies while giving birth , " she says			0
" that is my hope			0
