more than 200 bottlenose dolphins spent a second day penned in a cove by @entity5 fishermen , @entity1 conservationists said sunday , many of them stressed and bloodied from their attempts to escape			1
the dolphins will spend a third night without food or rest in @entity12 before the fishermen likely start to slaughter them monday for meat , the @entity8 said			1
until now , the fishermen have focused on selecting dolphins to be sold into captivity at marine parks and aquariums in @entity5 and overseas , the conservation group said			1
twenty - five dolphins , including a rare albino calf , were taken on saturday " to a lifetime of imprisonment , " and another 12 on sunday , the group said			0
two dolphins have died in the process			0
environmental activists have been monitoring activities in the cove in southwest @entity5 , which is a focal point of the @entity12 community 's annual dolphin hunting season			1
although the hunting of dolphins is widely condemned in the west , @entity5 defend the practice as a local custom -- and say it is no different to the slaughter of other animals for meat			1
@entity44 , the recently installed @entity1 ambassador to @entity5 , tweeted that she is " deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing			1
" the @entity8 has been live - streaming video of events in the cove and posting frequent updates on @entity51			0
" many of the 200 + @entity55 dolphins who are in still the cove are visibly bloody & injured from their attempts to escape the killers , " one update sunday said			1
another appealed for people to do their part to end the demand for dolphins captured from the wild			0
" @entity66 in @entity12 continues because of the captive trade			2
please do not support aquariums & parks with marine mammals , " it said			0
opinion : eat fish , kill a dolphin ? slaughter under tarpaulins the dolphins earmarked for slaughter include those with nicks or markings which make them less desirable as captives			2
the @entity8 described how about 40 to 60 local fishermen work with nets to divide up the pod , whose initial numbers were estimated by the group at more than 250			2
" they tighten up the nets to bring each sub-group together then the skiffs push them toward the tarps			0
under the tarps in the shallows is where the trainers work with the killers to select the ' prettiest ' dolphins which will sell and make the best pay day for the hunters , " the group said			0
" but the process is brutal and stressful			0
some of them die from injuries incurred during the manhandling or simply the stress			0
" once the slaughter begins , it will turn the water in the cove red with blood , as documented in footage captured by the @entity8 in the past			0
the fishermen will " kill the ' undesirable ' dolphins ( those with nicks and scars ) under the tarps to hide from our cameras when that time comes , " the group said			0
officials say criticism is biased , unfair @entity126 has been unable to reach anyone at the town office for @entity12 , a community of about 3,000 that juts into the @entity130 , or the local fishermen 's union for comment			1
but local officials have reacted angrily in the past to @entity137 criticism of what they say is a traditional practice dating back centuries			1
a 2009 @entity142 - nominated documentary film , " @entity143 , " brought the issue of dolphin hunting in @entity12 to the fore with bloody scenes of dolphin slaughter			1
the @entity149 , where @entity12 is , condemned the film in an online response as distorted , biased and unfair to the fishermen			2
" the @entity12 dolphin fishery has been a target of repeated psychological harassment and interference by aggressive foreign animal protection organizations , " it said			2
" @entity12 dolphin fishermen are just conducting a legal fishing activity in their traditional way in full accordance with regulations and rules under the supervision of both the national and the prefectural governments			1
therefore , we believe there are no reasons to criticize the @entity12 dolphin fishery			2
" the @entity5 practice of whale hunting has also put it in conflict with the views of much of the world			1
@entity5 's fleet carries out an annual whale hunt despite a worldwide moratorium , taking advantage of a loophole in the law that permits the killing of the mammals for scientific research			0
whale meat is commonly available for consumption in @entity5			2
environmental activists warn that dolphin meat , also sold for consumption in @entity5 , contains dangerously high levels of mercury and other toxins			1
@entity126 first learned about this story through a @entity194 posted by @entity195 , an environmental attorney and activist in @entity197			0
" there are activists around the world that are calling the embassy and the press , but i knew i could n't do much , so i wrote this @entity194 , " she said .			0
