the @entity9 , who won the first match by 150 runs , failed to reach three figures in an innings for the first time since 1984 as captain @entity15 paid for his decision to bat first in bowler - friendly conditions after winning the toss			1
@entity1 , led by new captain @entity20 after @entity21 ended his brief return to the @entity24 arena following that defeat at @entity26 , then reached 148 - 3 before rain cut short the opening day in @entity29			1
teenage paceman @entity30 and fellow opening bowler @entity31 took three wickets each as @entity4 crashed to the nation 's lowest first - innings score since 1956 -- when dismissed for 80 , also by @entity1			1

" i do n't know what the captain and coach 's decision was going to be but if we won the toss we were ready to bowl first			0

the @entity63 went into a 13 - match losing run against @entity4 that goes back to 1995 , but struck an early blow when the 18 - year - old @entity30 trapped opener @entity67 leg before wicket for 13			1
@entity21 quits tests after 150 - run defeat at @entity26 that opened the floodgates as @entity31 sent @entity74 ( 5 ) and @entity15 ( 6 ) back to the pavilion at @entity76 in similar fashion , and @entity35 bowled @entity78 ( 3 )			2
from 29 - 4 , @entity4 slumped further to 73 - 6 at lunch as @entity80 ( 5 ) also went lbw to @entity35 and @entity60 was caught behind off the medium pace of @entity59			0
@entity30 then took wickets with the first two balls of the middle session , bowling @entity85 and @entity86 , but @entity62 avoided becoming the hat - trick victim			0
@entity4 's bowlers could not extract the same amount of swing from the overcast conditions , and @entity20 put on 80 for the first wicket with @entity93 before being bowled by @entity62			1
