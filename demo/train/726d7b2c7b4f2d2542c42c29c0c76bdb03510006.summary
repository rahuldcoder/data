-- today on @entity3 , my daughter and i will sift through the candy she receives from her third - grade classmates and throw most of it away			1
although the tradition of trading chocolate and sugared hearts seems harmless , it actually poses a risk to my daughter and the millions of other @entity14 children who suffer from severe food allergies			1
this threat became all too real at the beginning of january with the death of 7 - year - old @entity19			1
@entity19 died of an allergic reaction to a peanut , and her @entity22 , @entity23 , school did not give her any medication			1
the emotional devastation of this loss is compounded by its senselessness : @entity19 's death could have been easily prevented by epinephrine			1
a form of adrenaline , epinephrine immediately counters the symptoms of anaphylaxis : hives , breathing difficulties and , without intervention , death			2
in our family , we are well - acquainted with epinephrine , administered by an automatic injector and sold under the brand names of @entity43 or @entity43			1
my daughter has needed multiple shots of epinephrine in four emergencies , and those shots saved her life			1
these experiences taught us how serious her allergies are			2
our simple rule is that we do n't leave home without it			0
we 're pretty vigilant , and yet we 've left epipens at birthday parties , friend 's houses and in the middle of a park			2
with the benefit of health insurance , we can afford to buy another one			0
the @entity67 to @entity68 , a bipartisan bill introduced at the end of last year and being considered in committee , encourages states to pass laws introducing incentives for schools to stock epinephrine for all students -- not just those who have a prescription			1
having epinephrine on hand would protect everyone , including those who have not yet been diagnosed with a food allergy			1
the latter represents a significant group : studies have shown that up to 25 % of all epinephrine administrations at school involve someone whose allergy was previously unknown			1
of the eight top food allergens , research suggests the most common ones are peanuts , followed by milk , shellfish and tree nuts			0
chocolate often has milk or nuts in it and can be cross-contaminated : even if a piece of chocolate does not contain any allergens , it might have been produced on the same line as chocolates that do			0
stocking epinephrine at schools will help to ease concerns about using another child 's medication for someone who needs it but does not have an @entity43 at school			1
as @entity121 , ceo of the @entity122 , explains , this legislation " puts into place the laws we need to encourage people to do the right thing			0
" granted , buying auto - injectors and training adults to use them will require time and money			0
it 's hard to imagine adding another expense when school budgets continue to dwindle			1
but for just a few hundred dollars every year , schools can ensure that all students are covered			1
some schools , including ours , already do this			0
initiatives in the private sector can help mitigate the costs : @entity139 , the manufacturer of @entity43 and @entity141 , has already offered its auto - injector at a 50 % reduced rate to schools			1
that comes to about $ 112 for two injectors			0
we should especially make sure that low - income districts can stock epinephrine			2
no parent should fear that his or her child might never come home from school			0
if the first step is having epinephrine , the second is knowing when and how to use it -- and not being afraid to do so			0
dr. @entity157 , professor of pediatrics at the @entity159 at the @entity160 , explains some of the most common reasons people do n't give epinephrine immediately : " not recognizing a reaction			2
being worried that the child is not ' sick enough			0
' being worried about side effects of the medication or that they might hurt the child			0
" i learned this the hard way			0
the second time my daughter had an allergic reaction , i failed to use her epipen			1
she was 3 , and i was eight months pregnant , home alone and paralyzed with fear			0
i did call 911 -- and luckily they arrived within minutes			0
but this experience taught me that her life depends upon the immediate use of epinephrine			0
all adults who supervise children should be trained to recognize an allergic reaction and use an auto - injector			1
at the moment , parents bear the burden of educating teachers , which is n't easy			0
creative collaborations may help schools take the lead , such as a free online tutorial for educators recently introduced by the @entity122 , the @entity194 and several @entity196 organizations			0
food allergies have become a part of @entity14 childhood , just like childhood obesity , diabetes and asthma			2
according to a 2011 study in @entity205 , 8 % of children in the @entity14 have a food allergy			1
surely initiatives focusing on healthy habits , such as @entity211 's @entity210 ! campaign , can incorporate teaching kids that not all foods are safe for everyone and that washing hands after eating can help to prevent spreading food allergens			2
often the healthiest option is also the safe one -- like sending stickers to school on @entity3 instead of candy			1
and if we continue to indulge our sweet tooth on special occasions , let 's at least focus on making school safe for everyone			2
follow @entity228 on @entity229 join the conversation on @entity231 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			2

a 7 - year - old died of an allergic reaction to a peanut ; school had not given her medication
epinephrine has saved @entity234 's daughter , who has a severe food allergy
schools should have epinephrine , she says , and train teachers to administer it
@entity234 : on @entity3 , chocolates brought to school put children with allergies at risk
