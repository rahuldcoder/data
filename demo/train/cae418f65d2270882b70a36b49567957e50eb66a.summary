@entity1 , @entity0 -- it was against the terms of the @entity7 / @entity6 cease - fire , brokered by @entity9 's president @entity8			1
it was directly in contravention of the request not to do it from president @entity13 of the @entity14			0
but @entity7 's president @entity15 has gone and done it anyway			1
he has made @entity7 the first country to recognize the independence of @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity7 president @entity15 says it has recognized the independence of @entity20 and @entity19			1
so does that , as some of the more fevered commentators are suggesting , amount to a new @entity27 ? it certainly ratchets up the @entity30 tension still further			0
it breaks the terms of a cease - fire which insisted @entity6 's territorial integrity should be respected			1
@entity7 's announcement that it will station troops in the two territories to ensure their " security " , a word others might spell as " subservience " , is a direct provocation			1
it is , says @entity6 , an illegal " annexation "			2
other @entity45 nations have hastened to condemn it as an unacceptable rewriting of borders by force			0
what do you think of @entity7 recognition ? @entity14 secretary of state @entity53 , currently in the @entity54 , points out that it is in contravention of @entity58 resolutions that the @entity7 have accepted			1
@entity8 has called a meeting of @entity61 leaders for monday to look at @entity6 and at future relations with @entity7			1
but before we start talking about a new @entity27 -- and @entity65 leaders from @entity13 down are being careful not to do so -- we should examine the context			0
after the military action initiated by @entity6 early in august , there never was a chance that @entity19 and @entity20 , which have in effect been independent since the early 1990s , would return to control by @entity72			2
applying a blowtorch is n't necessarily the best way of settling what had become known as " frozen conflicts "			0
@entity7 has long been in a position to bully and has now been given the excuse to do so			2
for years the two disputed territories have survived on @entity7 military and economic assistance			1
although @entity20 seeks fuller independence , a large number of @entity19 , perhaps 70 or 80 per cent of them , have @entity7 passports and would vote for membership of the @entity7			1
both disputed territories use the rouble			0
but this is n't , and never has been , just about @entity6			0
it is about the reassertion of regional power by a country which had smarted for years over the collapse of the @entity95 and the eastward march of @entity97 , swallowing up former members of the @entity99			0
what we are seeing is a resurgent @entity7 currently prepared to strut the beach kicking sand in everybody 's eyes and defying any affronted party to take them on			1
when @entity97 leaders met in the wake of the invasion of @entity6 and came up with nothing more concrete than the " suspension of normal relations " , the weakness of a divided @entity114 was all too obvious to @entity115 and @entity15			1
they have now taken the next step down the line of provocation			0
" scrap the @entity120 altogether and see if we care ! " is the message			0
and , playing as the back - beat sub-theme through all this is the question of @entity125 , a question which looks very different according to whether you are seated in @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 or @entity131			0
" if it was right for the @entity135 to be given the right to declare independence from @entity138 , then why should n't the people of @entity19 be allowed to choose separation from @entity72 ? " demand the @entity115 supporters in the @entity7 @entity133			1
" ah yes , " some say , " but what about those threats from @entity128 to turn @entity7 missiles against @entity145 now that the @entity145 have agreed to host the anti-missile batteries for the @entity14 missile defense plan ? is n't that a dangerous new escalation ? " again , it depends where you are sitting			1
" how would @entity131 like it if the @entity7 were to stage anti-missile batteries in @entity156 ? " is @entity128 's answer			2
what seems to be forgotten amid the current rhetorical battle is that the threats to make @entity145 a target for @entity7 missiles are nothing new			2
before the @entity161 back in 2007 , @entity115 got the world in a tizzy with precisely the same threats , at that stage being used to stir @entity145 domestic opposition to the idea of hosting the missile battery			0
in october 2007 , @entity115 said the missile plan risked becoming a new cuban missile crisis , probably the closest the world ever came to a nuclear war			0
then , during an election , he threatened to point missiles at western @entity45 , walk away from a 1980s treaty limiting missiles and scrap a treaty limiting conventional forces in @entity45 ( which @entity7 has since done )			0
first deputy prime minister @entity179 , then seen as @entity115 's potential successor , threatened to site cruise missiles in @entity182 , the @entity7 enclave between @entity145 and @entity183			2
general @entity184 , then in charge of @entity7 's ballistic arsenal , said last december : " i do not exclude the missile defense shield sites in @entity145 and the @entity188 being chosen as targets for our intercontinental ballistic missiles			2
" the big problem for the @entity114 ( and especially next monday 's meeting of @entity61 leaders , who need to make a more effective job of it than @entity97 's foreign ministers did last week ) , is just how to respond to @entity7 's current bout of strutting without making things worse -- and how to do it without cutting off their own noses in the process			1
they could agree to make it harder for @entity7 to join the @entity205			0
they could even threaten to eject @entity7 from the @entity161			0
but what do they gain by doing so , especially those of them in the @entity61 who depend on @entity7 for a hefty chunk of their energy supplies ? for years the @entity114 has been trying to draw @entity7 in , not push it further out into the cold			1
they need @entity7 's cooperation on climate change , on fighting terrorism , on achieving peace in the @entity54 and on curbing @entity221 's nuclear ambitions			2
and , let it not be forgotten , in keeping open @entity97 's supply routes for its mission in @entity224			0
the @entity114 is not ready to go to war over @entity7 's neighbors ( or " near abroad " as @entity128 terms it ) but it does still have a role to play in the @entity7 economy			1
the @entity61 may be dependent on @entity7 energy but it is also @entity7 's biggest customer			2
it should use the economic levers it has , refuse to allow the @entity7 to pick off individual members with bilateral deals and learn to use its collective strength in demanding common standards of its fellow @entity161 member			0
the worst thing it could do is to utter threats which it will not , or can not , follow through .			1

@entity7 president signs order recognizing independence of @entity6 territories
@entity114 opposes the *decision* , says that it *impinges* on @entity6 *international* borders
*overshadowing* the issue is the @entity114 's recognition of @entity125 independence
*analysis* : the worst the @entity114 could do is to utter threats it does not follow through
