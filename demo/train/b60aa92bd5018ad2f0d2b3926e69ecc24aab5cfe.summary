@entity0 , @entity1 -- setting one species up to scare off or even kill another is nothing new			0
one of the world 's most fearsome killers ? me ? the heart - stoppingly infamous cane toad			1
toads , bees , mongoose and even moths have all been utilized with varying degrees of success over the years in the hope that they could do the job humans could n't			2
sometimes it works , frequently it does n't , and in some cases we are still waiting to find out			0
if any of these following examples teaches us anything at all , it is that if you are going to play with @entity27 , you do so at your own peril			0
click here for gallery Â» the @entity31 who would have thought a humble toad could end up as the killer of one of the world 's most fearsome creatures , the crocodile ? it all started off so innocently , too			1
introduced to @entity40 in 1935 from @entity41 , the cane toad , which is native to @entity43 and @entity44 , was supposed to kill off the scarab beetles that were decimating @entity40 sugarcane crops			1
unfortunately , the toads failed to go after the beetles and decided to multiply at a very fast rate instead ( they can lay between 8,000 and 30,000 eggs in one go ) ending up as another pest the @entity40 were keen to see the back of			2
according to the @entity40 @entity57 ( @entity56 ) , the cane toad " expanded through @entity40 's northern landscape at 27 - 50 kilometers a year " and is now heading south at a rate of 1.3 kilometers a year			1
cane toads not only eat pretty much anything that can fit in their mouths , but as of yet , no known predators or diseases have been identified that can take them on			1
the problem is that they are extremely toxic , with the @entity56 stating " almost anything that eats the toad dies rapidly from heart failure "			0
according to the @entity74 , crocodile populations that have come across these new pests have been dropping like flies , in some places by as much as 77 percent			2
small @entity80 mongoose the risk with hired killers is that sometimes they can be a bit too good at their job			1
such is the case with the small @entity80 mongoose , which was introduced into @entity41 and some of its surrounding islands in 1883			1
the idea was the mongoose , a " voracious and opportunistic predator , " according to @entity91 , would keep rats out of the sugarcane fields , where they had been feasting on what was on offer			2
the mongooses came in and missed out on the rats , as the former happened to be day - lovers , while the latter was nocturnal			0
so they turned their attention to other species instead , including birds ( specifically ground nesters ) , small mammals and reptiles ( they particularly liked snakes and iguanas )			0
little did the @entity110 know at the time , but the small @entity80 mongoose is one of the world 's most fearsome killers , now listed by the @entity114 in the top 100 of the world 's worst invaders			1
these tiny creatures have hunted several species to extinction , including , says @entity91 , at least seven types of amphibians and reptiles in the @entity123 ; and in @entity124 alone it has been responsible for the extinction of a lizard , a snake , a rat and two birds			0
in @entity41 , the endangered @entity131 crow , the endangered dark - rumped petrel and the nene goose are now all at risk , thanks to the appetite of this tiny , furry creature			0
and to make matters worse , this particular mongoose is a vector for rabies too			0
the @entity143 sparrow the early bird catches the worm , but if that bird is an @entity143 sparrow , it does a little more than that , as the @entity149 found out in 1850			0
it was then that the bird was intentionally introduced to the @entity149 as a means of protecting trees from canker worms			0
but according to @entity155 , the sparrow also set about feasting on crops as well			0
the sparrow had a very varied appetite , feeding on wheat , oats , corn and barley , pretty much any vegetable or fruit it laid its eyes on and it had a taste for chicken feed too			0
surprisingly for its size , the sparrow is also a fairly aggressive creature and proved a bit of a bully to the locals , " displacing some native birds and harassing others " , says @entity155			0
to add insult to injury , it carried 29 diseases that infected both humans and livestock			0
while @entity149 populations are now largely on the decline , according to the @entity181 , @entity40 meanwhile is on high alert , with the bird now having been assigned as " an extreme threat category " there			2
the @entity186 @entity40 has an unenviable claim to fame : it is home to the most number of mammal extinctions in the world			1
according to the @entity196 ( @entity196 ) , nearly half of all mammals that have gone extinct in the last 200 years , have been @entity40			2
and much of the responsibility for these extinctions rests on the shoulders of introduced predators like the red fox			1
just on its own the red fox could be responsible for " dozens of small mammal extinctions " in the country , according to @entity91			1
the @entity143 brought the red fox with them to the country in 1855 , not only introducing it for a spot of hunting , but also , it is thought , to control the brown hare populations			1
unfortunately , the red fox was an excellent predator but it liked chasing after more types of creatures than just the brown hare			1
it had a ball , as @entity40 wildlife just was n't equipped to deal with it			2
as a result , it freely preyed on birds , mammals of varying sizes and reptiles			0
it particularly seemed to like newborn lambs , goat kids and chickens , creating an economic headache for local farmers			0
and it did n't take them too long to spread either -- according to @entity40 's @entity56 , it took the red fox just 100 years to inhabit almost the entire continent			1
a natural scavenger , the red fox is incredibly adaptable too , which has meant not only has it proliferated on a massive scale , but with the absence of any real predators to speak of , they have proven very difficult indeed to kill			1
the @entity245 red fox is often described as @entity40 's number one predator ; and as its also a " key carrier of rabies " , says @entity248 , the red fox is up there amongst @entity40 's most unwelcome guests			1
