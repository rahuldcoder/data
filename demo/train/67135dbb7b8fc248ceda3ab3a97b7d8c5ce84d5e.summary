@entity1 refugee camp , @entity2 -- the dried up cattle pond is only a few meters off the red road that runs through @entity1 refugee camp			1
it 's a huge hole in the ground , long emptied by the blazing sun. at the bottom of this pit women and children dig with cups and bowls in the smelly , spongy mud for the little dirty water that seeps into their shallow wells			2
@entity1 refugee camp is in a desperate situation			1
all day @entity21 trucks water from the very few working boreholes in or near the camp to tanks close to the road			1
women wait in the heat for up to four hours twice a day , next to their long queues of buckets and jerry cans			0
men with sticks and whips police the lines			0
fights break out all the time			0
no one has to ask why			0
there is simply not enough water and we are running out of options and we are running out of time			1
this is the daily struggle that is the human face of peace failing in the @entity46			2
the conflict in @entity48 has been going on for months , and now in the past few weeks fighting between @entity2 and @entity2 threatens to further destabilize the wider border region these refugees still live in			1
like a cruel reminder of the conflict that the refugees fled , unidentified @entity53 -- the kind of planes that bombed their villages in @entity48 -- flew over @entity1 camp three times in the past few weeks			1
in a panic , refugees ran and sought safety in holes in the ground			2
to truly understand why peace is so important , the world needs to remember it 's not just the fighting that matters but also the enormous suffering it causes those who have already been forced to flee it			2
the interrupted lives , deadened by displacement in the hot , unblinking heat			0
in barely established camps like @entity1 there 's nothing to do but wait			1
in @entity1 -- where water is rationed well below people 's needs , enough only for cooking and bathing - that struggle has become a crisis that is about to deepen as the rainy season approaches			1
how to get enough water ? that is the burning question , but the ground here has few answers			2
there is just not enough water to cope with so many new people -- and now there are fears that more may arrive as conflict spreads			1
we 've done a hydro - geological survey and we 've drilled for new boreholes			0
we have even resorted to water divining -- a traditional method using metal rods in the hope of detecting ground water			2
only one drill has produced any water , but very little			2
we were completely reliant on four overworked boreholes pumping 22 hours a day			0
one of these collapsed last week , and now there are just three			0
rationing has been tightened again			0
it was a grim evening in our base in the camp that night			2
we ate our meal to the loud hum of the generator with our hearts in our stomachs			0
the refugees were settled here partly because the host community was welcoming			1
but as water sources run out or dry up and more and more refugees arrive , competition for water is beginning to cause conflict here too			1
fights break out at water points			2
the pressure is intense and i fear it will get worse			0
the heavy rains are coming , bringing fresh problems			0
it rained last week for three hours , long enough to destroy many of the flimsy shelters of plastic sheeting , sheets , or straw the refugees have constructed under trees			2
whole families were left exposed			0
the rains will flood large parts of the camp , bringing the threat of disease and making trucking water in very difficult -- perhaps impossible as the roads deteriorate into impassable mud slicks			1
drilling in the rains is also near impossible			0
it is hard to express how miserable the mud of @entity149 is			0
it 's a kind of black clay that sticks to everything , the stuff of quagmires			0
largely impermeable , water sits on top of it , a massive health risk not just encouraging malaria but also water - borne diseases including cholera			0
humanitarian agencies working in the camp are looking into options including relocating a large number of the refugees to a new site , and putting in a pipeline that will hopefully mean the water can reach the camp more reliably when the roads fall apart			1
but there 's only one real solution			0
people need peace and people need to be able to go home			1
unless all parties involved in the fighting stop and focus on long - term peace then i fear that the situation in @entity2 and @entity2 will reverse to how it was during wartime , @entity181 's longest civil war , the most recent phase of which lasted 22 years and left around 2 million people dead			1
all that progress made in the years following the 2005 peace agreement risks being lost			0
the international community played a major role in brokering that peace -- now is the time to make sure it lasts			1
the people in @entity1 , and across the two countries , deserve to be free from the constant threat of crisis			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

*hundreds* of *thousands* of refugees have fled conflict in @entity2 , @entity2 border region
many have taken shelter in @entity1 camp , but water supplies are running low
@entity21 worker @entity200 says international community must take *action*
@entity200 : " people need peace , and to be able to go home "
