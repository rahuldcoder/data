@entity0 , @entity1 -- his ramrod straight posture and slicked - back buzz cut give it away			1
@entity7 is a boot camp veteran			1
but today , he 's drilling his rookies for perhaps the most challenging mission of their lives : fatherhood			2
one by one , an army of expectant dads files into @entity7 's classroom at @entity16 near @entity17 , hoping to gain some wisdom from the @entity20 - turned - " daddy boot camp " instructor			1
@entity22 arrived 20 minutes early , admittedly tense			2
his baby girl is due in less than a month			1
" i 've never babysat , i 've never taken care of a child , so that 's probably why i 've been nervous , " he said			2
@entity22 has the crib , the nursery , the bottles and the bibs			2
but he has n't a clue about what to actually do with the baby			1
" it 's not like they 're power tools , " said @entity22 , a marketing manager for @entity35 auto parts			2
" they do n't come with instruction manuals			2
it 's a kid , a human life			2
... you leave the hospital , and that 's it			2
" he 's among some 300,000 expectant dads who have turned to @entity47 for new dads , a program now in 45 states as well as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
the course started in 1990 near a @entity57 base in @entity58 , and has grown despite declining attendance in childbirth classes nationwide as more parents turn to the @entity62			2
boot camps now take place everywhere from affluent communities to low - income neighborhoods and even a prison in @entity68			2
" i 'd say it 's more important in low - income communities			2
the role models have more impact there , " said @entity72 , founder of @entity47 for new dads			1
in three hours , the men in this boot camp learn a battery of " troubleshooting and diagnostics , " including how to swaddle and soothe a crying baby , change a loaded diaper and deal with the mother during and after pregnancy			1
@entity87 's baby is n't due until january 29 , but the anxiety is already evident on his face			1
" i know what i 'm most scared of			2
i 'm most scared of 4 a.m. in the morning , and the baby not being able to stop crying for two hours			1
what do you do ? " with 10 men surrounding a brightly colored mat and blanket on the floor , @entity7 , a father of two , issues a disclaimer : " i 'm not a doctor			1
i do n't play one on tv , and i did n't stay in a hotel last night			0
i 'm just a dude , " the instructor said			0
his assistant today is 1 - month - old @entity105 , daughter of recent boot camp graduate @entity106			0
within minutes , @entity105 morphed from smiling and tranquil to irritated and screaming			0
" you 've got a set of lungs on you , " @entity7 said as he lay her down on the blanket			0
after a few swift motions with the cloth , @entity7 picked up the tightly wrapped infant and held her on her side , parallel to his chest			0
" shhh , " he blew loudly across her cheek			0
less than six seconds later , wailing @entity105 fell silent in @entity7 's sturdy arms			0
" it 's like magic ! " one rookie exclaimed			0
in addition to hands - on demonstrations and training , in this room , no subject is off limits			0
females over 2 feet tall are not allowed , so men can share their concerns freely -- particularly about how to handle their mates			1
" this class was my idea because i wanted something to help me learn to deal with her , " @entity87 said , echoing other husbands ' concerns about their wives			1
" she 's going through a lot			0
" @entity7 addresses a variety of mother - related topics , including how to help during labor , how to spot signs of postpartum depression and how to gain her trust as a caretaker			0
" the biggest challenge the dad has is establishing enough credibility so that mom will relinquish control , " he said			1
" if you do n't have the hands - on skills , and you do n't have knowledge of the ( baby 's ) cues ... it will be very hard to come to any kind of arrangement and have any kind of credibility			1
those who do n't have those skills tend to get treated as secondary parents			0
they 'll feel sort of left out			0
" he said other topics men often reserve for boot camp include sex , discomfort with changing diapers and finances			1
@entity7 , who spent four years in the @entity57 , is among a network of experienced dads who have graduated from daddy boot camp and have come back as instructors			1
" people who know me think it 's either absolutely odd or encouraging that i 'm doing this on my off time , " @entity7 said			0
but there are parallels between the @entity57 and daddy boot camp , he said			0
" when you look at military people , they look at critical skill sets			0
once they learn what those skill sets are , they practice , practice , practice until they perfect them			1
" he said the same holds true for quieting a bawling baby by swaddling , or wrapping a baby snugly in a blanket to mimic the feeling inside the womb			1
@entity106 , @entity105 's father , said he also returned to boot camp to help pay forward what he learned			0
" it was such a help for me , i knew if i brought her in it would help everyone else , " the executive search firm owner said			0
dressed in a crisp white shirt and stylish watch , @entity106 looks more prepared for business than a daddy boot camp , until you see the pink @entity217 blanket in tow			0
he said he did n't expect to be such a hands - on father , figuring he 'd primarily work while his wife took care of most baby issues			1
" once i had the baby , that completely changed my perspective on everything , " he said			1
" i love it , she 's so much fun			0
it 's more work than i expected , but anytime i look at her face , it relieves all my problems			0
" before long , @entity105 produced her second dirty diaper of the class			1
" ok -- next victim , " @entity7 said			0
a few groans sounded across the room as @entity87 stepped up to the plate , cautiously removing a loaded diaper for the first time			1
" i was like , oh man , do n't twist the baby 's ankle , make sure you get it clean all the way around , " he said			1
by the end of the boot camp , @entity87 also learned how to feed @entity105			0
after a mild struggle to get the bottle in her mouth , his trepidation about fatherhood seemed to melt away			0
" i got a little warm and mushy inside , " he said			0
" baby papa syndrome kicked in , and i was like , yeah , this is going to be my kid soon			1

300,000 expectant dads have turned to @entity47 for new dads
program is in 45 states as well as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54
