-- for years , employees at @entity2 have suggested a project near and dear to their nerd hearts : a @entity2 - led science fair			1
" it 's come up over and over and over again , " says @entity6 , a senior product marketing manager in education at @entity2			0
after all , many a @entity9 has fond childhood memories of explaining the genius of his or her biology experiment to passersby in a school gym			0
( @entity6 and her best friend trained hamsters to ask for food by ringing a bell			0
) today those @entity21 and budding scientists worldwide should be ecstatic			0
the company launched @entity24 , the first global online science competition			1
it 's open to full - time students ages 13 to 18 , who are encouraged to use the panoply of @entity2 products to record and share their work			1
" we want to let kids use our online tools so they can participate from anywhere in world , " @entity6 tells @entity0			2
" they may be home schooled or live in a remote place or not have a physical science fair in their area			1
" they do , however , need an internet connection			0
this is a far cry from your typical local science fair			1
@entity2 's competition kicked off this morning at its @entity49 offices with some showy science courtesy of @entity51 , the company behind the @entity52 for last year 's @entity53 viral hit " @entity55			1
" @entity57 's machine for @entity2 fired a laser , activating a rover that lifted a red curtain draped over the fair 's logo			2
then @entity2 brought a riveting cast of scientists on stage to inspire the 100 or so local students in attendance			2
@entity2 's partners include @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72			2
consequently , the judges are not your eighth - grade biology teacher and the football coach who took a freshman chemistry course			2
they include @entity78 , its chief internet evangelist and one of the fathers of the @entity83 , and @entity69 's explorer - in - residence , the geneticist @entity85			1
@entity78 gave a brief history of the @entity87 , telling students that breakthroughs of that magnitude do n't " just happen			2
" they require scientists asking questions , forming hypothesis , failing , and then asking more questions			0
if it seems to students as if all the good stuff has already been discovered , @entity78 said , remember that " 95 % of the universe is unknown to us			2
" @entity0 : @entity2 drops @entity102 @entity103 , a self - taught scientist from @entity104 , @entity105 , talked about the direct impact that science can have , not just on society at large , but on an individual community			1
from reading a library book , @entity103 , the son of a farmer and one of seven kids , learned how to build a wind mill , which powers his family 's house and pumps water in an impoverished area			0
he taught his neighbors how to build wind mills , too , which have transformed schools and improved conditions in the village			0
if his poignant story was n't enough to spur the young scientists in the room and those watching the live stream of the event online , then that of @entity132 , a 15 - year - old dynamo from @entity133 , @entity134 , most likely did			1
she began programming computers at age 5 , enrolled in community college at 12 , and last year was recognized for her skills by the @entity140			0
one of @entity132 's experiments , using artificial intelligence to route robots and assist nurses in a local @entity146 hospital , serves as the model project on the @entity24 site			1
@entity0 : more technology coverage the goal of the @entity24 is n't just to give great prizes , including a trip to the @entity153 and $ 110,000 in scholarships			1
it 's to foster more interest in science worldwide and to come up with much - needed solutions to local and global problems -- if not now , then eventually			1
" we want kids to make a difference in the world , " says @entity6			0
" they can be agents of change			0
" the deadline for submissions is april 4			0
in july , 15 finalists will attend the awards ceremony at @entity2 headquarters in @entity171 , @entity172			0
