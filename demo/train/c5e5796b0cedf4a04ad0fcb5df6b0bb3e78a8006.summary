-- only 20 minutes so far ? i ca n't keep sitting on this bike			1
i 'll just leave class and use the restroom			1
i do n't need to go to the bathroom , but it will give my rear end a break			1
what if everyone stares at me ? oh no , now my toes are going numb ! these thoughts flew through my head during my second spin class a few weeks ago			1
recently , our fit nation workouts have picked up in intensity			1
i have tried new activities and pushed myself beyond my physical comfort zone			1
when this journey began , i envisioned the biggest obstacle to my success would be physical			1
but after seven weeks of training , i have become acutely aware of the body part that needs the most conditioning			1
and much to my surprise , it 's not my abs , triceps or quads			2
i 've come to the conclusion that wanting to stop mid-workout has little to do with my body and everything to do with my mind			1
i know many folks who experience negative self - talk , where that little voice in your head tells you all the reasons you ca n't do something			2
my internal dialogue seems to be less focused on telling myself i ca n't do it and more concerned with developing and executing a workout exit strategy			2
my brain does n't say , " you ca n't			2
" it says , " you should n't			2
" oh , but i should			2
change your mind , and your body will follow suit			1
but how do you change your mind ? that 's the million - dollar question			1
t - shirt tales : the athlete i used to be it turns out some cliches are true			2
the first step is admitting you have a problem			2
hi , my name is @entity64 , and i can talk myself out of a workout before i start			2
i had a long day at work			2
i need to put gas in my car			2
excuses and justifications are the path of least resistance			0
here are some other cliches that have proved true during my training : listen to your body , not your head			1
i 've been in the middle of many workouts when i desperately wanted to stop			1
but when i focused on what i was doing , i could ask myself , " do i want to stop because i am in pain ? or am i just uncomfortable because i 'm sweating , breathing hard and making my body stronger ? " if i am honest with myself , the answer every time has been " i 'm just uncomfortable			1
" and guess what ? i have finished every workout i have started			0
get fit and others will follow the only thing we have to fear is fear itself			1
i recently read the amazing book " @entity97 " by @entity98			0
in it he writes , " there 's only one cure for fear			0
" that line resonated with me			1
it helped me understand that as an adult , fear has prevented me from realizing my full physical potential			0
in the past , fear is what has stopped me from even trying			0
so now , if i find myself dragging my heels about a workout , i try to identify the why			0
usually , it 's something silly such as fearing the embarrassment of sharing a lap lane and slowing down another swimmer			0
now when i go to pool and find myself in this situation , i simply watch the swimmers for a few minutes			0
i try to identify someone close to my speed and skill level			0
i then ask if i can share the lane and tell him or her upfront that i am new to training			1
this has worked every single time			0
the real key to overcoming these fears , as @entity98 pointed out , is faith			0
have faith in your journey , in the universe and in yourself			0
why being part of a team matters a picture is worth a thousand words			0
everyone , even the toughest endurance athletes , occasionally struggle during workouts			0
sometimes the only way i get through particularly tough workouts is visualization			1
at times , it 's remembering the two years i spent in nearly constant pain as i battled ulcerative colitis			0
compared with that , the aches and weariness of triathlon training pale			1
more often , i like to visualize my eventual triathlon success			0
i envision myself crossing the finish line on a warm , breezy day in @entity157 , @entity158 , this september			1
i see myself running into the arms of my husband , daughter , parents and sisters			0
i imagine that magical mixture of physical exhaustion , elation , pride and disbelief that i actually did it			0
and it keeps me going			0
oh , and that spin class ? i did not stop			1
i finished the class without stopping			0
and then i ran for 20 minutes afterward			0
