-- first of all , of course we 'd rather see more original blockbusters created with female leads in mind			0
though @entity10 has made strides in recent years toward more gender and racial diversity , success stories like @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are still the exceptions , not the rule			0
there 's plenty of research showing that women are still sorely underrepresented onscreen and behind the scenes			2
but news that a female version of " @entity24 " got us thinking about other films we 'd like to see recast with female leads			0
turns out it 's a ton of fun to imagine who would be the female @entity30 or @entity31 or @entity32			1
we also asked @entity0 's @entity34 audience what they thought and came up with the gallery above			1
let us know what you 'd add in the comments , but keep in mind that " @entity42 " is well - worn territory .			2

we asked @entity0 's @entity34 audience which women they 'd like to see in male *roles*
@entity47 as @entity48 in " @entity32 " ? why not ?
share your *recommendations* in the comments
