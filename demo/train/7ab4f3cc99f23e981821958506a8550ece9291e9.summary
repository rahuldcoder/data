editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior political analyst for @entity3 , appearing regularly on @entity3 's " @entity4 , " " @entity5 : no bias , @entity7 , " " ac360 Â° , " and " @entity8 , " as well as special event coverage			1
@entity10 became the target of his own party 's ire for calling @entity14 a racist			1
@entity16 ( @entity3 ) -- well , well			0
after initially waiting a few nanoseconds to call @entity19 nominee judge @entity14 a racist -- not to mention advising that she just ought to withdraw from consideration -- @entity10 has had a sudden change of heart			1
in the conservative magazine @entity24 , he writes on wednesday : " my initial reaction was strong and direct -- perhaps too strong and too direct			0
... since then , some who want to have an open and honest consideration of @entity14 's fitness to serve on the nation 's highest court have been critical of my word choice			1
... the word ' racist ' should not have been applied to @entity14 as a person , even if her words themselves are unacceptable			1
" an apology from @entity10 ? and one that contains a string of thoughts too long to @entity40 ? how can that be ? it seems as if poor @entity42 found himself the target of his own @entity45			1
some of the more serious folks in the @entity48 had been trying to figure out what kind of a jurist @entity14 might be , when @entity10 and @entity50 decided to morph into @entity51			1
their favorite topic ? @entity14 's now infamous statement that , " i would hope that a wise @entity55 woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life			1
self - serving , sure			0
but @entity42 and @entity62 just could n't leave it at that			2
personal name - calling is just so much more fun -- and attention - getting			0
so she became a racist ( even a reverse racist ) , in their words			0
not surprisingly , @entity45 senators trying to figure out a way to mount real questions about her judicial record were appalled			1
one @entity48 @entity45 told me that the @entity45 caucus grew increasingly furious at @entity42 's grandstanding			1
" people are really angry , " the senator says			0
" @entity10 and @entity50 have simply made it far more difficult for @entity45 to raise the legitimate issues			1
they 're so quick to throw the word racist around , they look ugly , and make us look the same way			0
" and ugly is not a good place to be when you 've just resoundingly lost an election -- with less than one - third of the @entity89 vote			0
if it stays at that level , @entity45 will have a hard time winning elections in key red states with growing @entity89 populations			2
" is calling her names our best talking point ? " asks @entity45 pollster @entity96			2
" it 's a symptom of being leaderless ; it 's every man for himself these days			0
" the point , he says , is not to question whether @entity14 is qualified to sit on the court			2
after all , after 17 years on the bench , there 's no doubt she has the right resume			0
the right question to ask , @entity96 rightly argues , is this : how is she going to fill that seat ? and then there 's this : instead of throwing around terms like " judicial activist , " why not actually examine her record and look for things that might have some real meaning for the @entity119 people ? in these economic times , the old culture wars arguments against judges as a group of evil - doers ready to ' legislate from the bench ' holds much less sway			1
" it 's got to be about a question of fairness when people are suffering economic anxiety , " says @entity96 , who looks to the @entity128 firefighters case as good fodder for discussion			0
in that case , the city denied promotions to a largely white group of firefighters after a civil service exam in which none of the black employees who took the test would have been promoted			0
" these people studied for a test , passed it and did n't get their promotions , " @entity96 says			0
and if the high court overturns @entity14 's ruling -- which some say is likely -- the decision would only make the case more incendiary			1
and that 's a fair discussion to have			0
but it should also be held in the context of the judge 's voluminous record			1
@entity158 of the respected @entity159 has done our work for us in examining the firefighters case plus 96 other race - related cases @entity14 ruled on while on the @entity165			2
@entity158 's findings hardly show the mark of a jurist who is looking for discrimination above all else			2
the judge and the panel rejected the claim of discrimination 78 times and found it to be accurate in 10 cases			2
nine of those cases were decided unanimously			0
overall , he calculates , " @entity14 rejected discrimination - related claims by a margin of roughly 8 to 1			1
" all in all , @entity158 writes , in an 11 - year career on the @entity189 , the judge " has participated in roughly 100 panel decisions involving questions of race and has disagreed with her colleagues in those cases ... a total of four times			1
" four times ? is that a legal activist ? a reverse racist ? a racist ? or even an extremist ? hardly			2
note to @entity10 : need new adjectives			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity10 backed off his charge @entity14 is a racist
she says @entity42 angered @entity48 @entity45 with his harsh language
@entity2 : study of judge 's decisions shows she usually rejects discrimination claims
she says @entity14 disagreed with judicial colleagues only four out of 100 times
