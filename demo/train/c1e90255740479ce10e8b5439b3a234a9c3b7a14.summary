players from @entity2 and the @entity3 embraced each other in celebration as both sides played out a 1 - 1 draw to book their passage into the quarter - finals of the @entity10			1
in a tense finale to @entity13 , all four teams still had the chance to qualify for the last eight until the final whistle went in a goalless draw between @entity18 and @entity19 in torrid conditions			1
it sparked contrasting celebrations , the coaches and players in @entity25 celebrating in unison while there were tears in @entity29 as 2012 champions @entity19 bowed out in the group stages for a second successive tournament			2
@entity2 coach @entity32 had called on his side , the 2004 @entity10 champions , to go all out for the win despite only needing to draw the match to qualify			1
and the north @entity38 side in reality should have achieved that feat by half - time such was their ascendancy			0
it was @entity44 who broke the deadlock just after the half - hour mark , the striker for @entity49 becoming only the second player to score two goals in this tournament after @entity3 's @entity53 as he headed home a flick on by @entity56			1
@entity56 thought he had enjoyed his own moment of glory with a superb volley only for it to be ruled offside , one of two disallowed goals for the @entity63			0
for a time , @entity3 , tournament winners in 1968 and 1974 , looked devoid of a response until drawing level against the run of play in the 65th minute through substitute @entity69			2
it was @entity73 's two goals that had helped seal his side 's route to the tournament against @entity78 and , just five minutes after coming on , he once again provided a telling difference			0
a long ball was headed into the box by @entity82 , @entity73 controlled it with aplomb and guided the ball into the net with his left foot			0
it was all the more befitting as moments earlier @entity88 should have already put the game out of @entity3 's reach			1
but @entity3 held firm for a record sixth straight draw in the tournament , the game ending slightly farcically in the final minute with neither side really playing as news of the result from @entity29 came in			2
that match was never going to be a classic , the two teams having scored just three times in 40 combined attempts in this tournament , and it was a cause not helped by a downpour that threatened to see the game abandoned altogether			0
if @entity19 had hoped the players would be inspired to shine in the wake of a pre-match call from president @entity112 , who won the election at the weekend , then they were to be sorely disappointed			0
@entity19 's @entity114 had the chance to grab the win his side needed to qualify late on but made a hash of his effort while @entity18 , level on three points with @entity3 , only missed out on the quarter - finals by virtue of goal difference .			1

@entity2 and @entity3 draw 1 - 1 to both reach the last eight of the @entity10
@entity3 sub @entity69 *cancels* out earlier strike by @entity2 's @entity44
@entity19 and @entity18 miss out on *knock* - out stages after goalless draw in downpour
