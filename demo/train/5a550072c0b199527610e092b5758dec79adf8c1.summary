-- a movement away from using chimpanzees for research is gaining speed			1
this month , a working group organized by the @entity6 issued a report recommending that most federally supported chimpanzees be retired and taken to sanctuaries			1
" it 's not that the chimpanzee is not itself a valuable animal , " said @entity10 of the @entity11 , who co-chaired the working group			0
but newer technologies , other animals and non-animal systems have been " shown to address questions that we before may have only been able to address for chimpanzees , " he said			2
a 60 - day comment period has begun on this report , and the public is invited to weigh in			1
after that , @entity6 director @entity24 will determine whether he will accept the report in its current form or make changes , @entity10 said			1
the recommendations pertain to the 360 chimpanzees that the @entity6 owns that are currently either " research active " or " research inactive			1
" an additional 91 chimps eligible for research live at the @entity36 in @entity37 ; although the @entity6 financially supports their maintenance , the agency can not itself retire these animals , @entity10 said			1
a separate group of 219 @entity6 - supported chimpanzees has been retired and is living at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , or the @entity46 at the @entity47			1
laboratory chimps get a new lease on life plans to accommodate additional retiring chimpanzees should begin " immediately , " the report said			1
but the report does not call for the elimination of all research on chimpanzees , who share about 99 % of their dna with humans			1
about 50 chimpanzees should be kept for potential research needs , the report said			1
they could all live in the same colony to minimize costs			2
in december 2011 , the @entity67 proposed guidelines ( @entity69 ) for chimpanzee research , stating that there is little anticipated need for these animals in research and that they should live in appropriate environments and social settings			0
at that time , the @entity67 committee highlighted two areas where chimpanzees could still be useful in biomedicine : creating a hepatitis c vaccine and developing therapies for cancerous tumors			0
studies of chimpanzees ' cognition and brain activity may also fit the group 's standards			0
the @entity6 accepted the institute 's report and established a working group to give further advice on how to implement those recommendations			1
to gather information for the new report , @entity10 and colleagues went on field trips to various facilities to discuss with their experts what works and what challenges they encounter			0
" we were not there to inspect facilities ; we were there to learn and to be exposed to how chimpanzees are maintained in a variety of environments , " @entity10 said			0
the report recommends that chimpanzees live in social groupings of at least seven and that no chimpanzee should live alone for extended periods of time without a documented medical reason or social circumstances			1
" pairs , trios , and even small groups of 4 to 6 individuals do not provide the social complexity required to meet the social needs of this cognitively advanced species , " the report said			0
chimpanzees should have a living space of at least 1,000 square feet per animal and should be able to climb at least 20 feet vertically , the report said			2
the @entity130 is happy about the report 's recommendations for chimpanzee retirement and for the standards of living conditions for the animals , although its ultimate goal is to end all animal use in research , said @entity140 , vice president for animal research issues			2
" it finally confirmed that there should be no chimpanzee breeding , which we were also very pleased with , " she said			0
@entity140 said no @entity147 laboratory meets the guidelines for chimpanzee living conditions described in this report			0
but @entity10 could not confirm this , as the working group did not evaluate individual sites based on those standards and did n't visit every single @entity147 laboratory			0
the report included the observation that smaller animal models have helped scientists make strides in highly virulent viruses			0
mice , rats , hamsters and guinea pigs are among the animals that are increasingly used for the research of emerging infectious diseases			0
" the availability of these models will continually raise the scientific bar for justifying the use of chimpanzees , " the report said			2
if the recommendations go into effect , they will have jurisdiction only over @entity6 - supported or owned chimpanzees			1
but there are other chimpanzees that are part of research in the @entity147 that do not fall into these categories			2
the @entity67 report counted more than 930 chimpanzees at @entity147 medical research facilities as of may 2011			2
many are used for hepatitis testing			0
morality : it 's not just for humans			0

the @entity6 owns 360 research - eligible chimpanzees
chimpanzees share about 99 % of their dna with humans
the @entity6 recommends keeping 50 chimps in a colony for potential research
the new report is open to public comment for 60 days
