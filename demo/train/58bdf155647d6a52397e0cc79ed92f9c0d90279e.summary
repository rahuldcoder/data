-- i am a journalist			0
i am a black woman			0
i am a witness to prejudice			0
i 've experienced it firsthand : random strangers have called me " n --- - r " on a busy street in @entity7 and in @entity8 , @entity9			0
so , i know the specter of hate when i see it			0
now it is hovering over @entity13 , @entity14 , where police say @entity16 and @entity17 confessed to shooting five people on april 6 , snuffing out the lives of three and wounding two others			1
the two have pleaded not guilty			0
this is a crime filled with hate , most certainly , but is this a hate crime ? it took seven days for @entity27 prosecutors to answer : yes to charges of first - degree murder , with shooting with intent to kill and with malicious intimidation or harassment -- @entity14 's equivalent of a hate crime			1
for many black people in @entity13 , it was a welcome bookend to what was a very angry week			1
here 's what had been reported : @entity17 is white , and @entity40 has been identified as white and , in some reports , as @entity42			0
all the victims that morning were black , and @entity40 's father , @entity44 , was killed by a black man in a shooting tied to an attempted home invasion in 2010			1
@entity40 's @entity49 postings about his father 's death have fueled much of the speculation			0
@entity40 is reported to have used a racial slur on his @entity49 page , and then wrote , " it 's hard not to go off			0
" the killings took place on @entity60 , and the men quickly were arrested on @entity62			1
but as of midweek , many wondered why officials had n't called the shooting spree a hate crime			1
you know what they say : if it looks like a hate crime and smells like a hate crime ... there is a lot we do n't know about this crime			0
@entity40 is recorded in a video released by his lawyer saying he does not hate blacks and that he counts many black people among his friends			1
some allegations say that @entity40 knew one of the victims			0
if that is true , how random were the shootings ? still , many others say the actions of choosing the people by their race clearly make it a hate crime			1
residents in the mostly black neighborhood in north @entity13 , where the shootings happened , and many officials in @entity14 are convinced the charge is correct			1
in a recent media conference call with several black officials and ministers , state sen. @entity99 , chairwoman of the @entity100 , said she was concerned about crimes against blacks and requested that the federal government get involved in the investigation to send a message			1
" this is a powder keg waiting to explode , " she said			0
@entity110 is executive director of the @entity112 , a group described as fighting for criminal justice reform in @entity14			1
she paraphrased the state 's intimidation statute : " a hate crime occurs when a person targets a person because of his or her ( inclusion ) in a group			0
" she added that the @entity112 talked to @entity13 police officials to express its concern			2
both @entity99 and @entity110 said they are worried that such crimes are increasing , citing the killing of @entity127 in @entity128 and crimes against black people in @entity14 during the past five years -- perhaps the most grisly being the unsolved killing of the rev. @entity132 in @entity133 , whose mutilated body was found in a church			1
@entity99 said these crimes are indicative of " a pattern of attacks on blacks here , not unlike the old @entity140			0
" @entity13 has a tortured history			2
in 1921 , after a black man was accused of molesting a white woman , a mob destroyed @entity13 's famous black business district			1
hundreds died in the riots			0
after years of forgotten history , the @entity149 to study the @entity150 published its findings in 2001 , referring to @entity13 's " emotional and physical scars of this terrible incident in our shared past			2
" so , nearly 100 years after what clearly was a hate crime , religious leaders quickly met with @entity13 's black community to discuss what 's been labeled another one			1
i asked a colleague who lives in @entity13 for her opinion			2
hate crime for sure , she said , but her reason was as eloquent and convincing as any i 've heard : " people are targets just because of who they are , not what they 're doing or involved in			2
therefore , until these suspects were caught , every black person in north @entity13 could logically fear that he or she could be shot			1
" now that the crime is officially labeled hate , people seem to feel justified			2
but another question lingers , as it does in the @entity127 case : what does it matter if it 's officially called hate if the shooters are convicted of murder ? for 48 long hours beginning on @entity60 , @entity13 's citizens felt that pain of bigotry , that sting of prejudice , that ache of fear			1
that 's enough to end the national debate and get on with it			0
bring justice for these five @entity14 families			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2

three black people were killed , two wounded in a shooting spree in @entity13 , @entity14
two men were arrested and charged with murder and with hate crimes
@entity196 : circumstances of shootings show they were clearly hate crimes
@entity209 says black community is relieved that prosecutors made the determination
