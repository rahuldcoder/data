the number of confirmed , probable and suspected cases of @entity2 in the current outbreak has surpassed 16,000 , according to the @entity4 , with nearly 7,000 deaths from those cases			1
the @entity8 ' health agency issued its latest numbers friday , focusing on how @entity2 has affected @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- the three countries where the vast majority of cases have occurred			1
@entity11 has been hit hardest , with the @entity4 reporting 7,244 confirmed and potential cases as well as 4,181 deaths			1
both numbers reported friday are significantly higher than those released earlier in the week			0
the @entity4 and other health agencies have long said the scale of the @entity2 outbreak is likely significantly worse than even the current high numbers indicate , because many people died before they could be diagnosed and many contracted the disease in remote areas without ready access to health care			1
the @entity8 health agency recently noted that the situation in @entity11 has stabilized in the past five weeks , after the rate of new cases declined from mid-september through mid-october			2
the one country where @entity4 has reported a significant uptick -- with 385 new confirmed cases during the week of november 23 and 533 in the previous week -- is @entity12			1
@entity2 and similar contagious diseases are not new to @entity38 , but the latest outbreak has been particularly virulent and deadly			2
about 60 % of those infected have died from the virus , according to @entity4			1
the rapid infection rate fanned concerns that , due to the relative ease of international travel , @entity2 might spread outside the continent			0
in fact , there have been new cases of @entity2 in the @entity50 and @entity51 , though such incidences remain a tiny fraction of the overall outbreak			2
the @entity8 has urged countries worldwide to pitch in , asking in september for nearly $ 1 billion to help @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 in their efforts to control the deadly disease			1
while experimental drugs and treatments have been used to treat @entity2 , there 's no known vaccine that can prevent the disease			0
earlier this week , the @entity62 reported on the first human trial on one vaccine that 's being fast - tracked by that government agency and @entity67 pharmaceutical giant @entity66			0
researchers tested the blood of 20 volunteers -- all healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 50 who got the vaccine -- at two weeks and four weeks after they first got their shots to determine if @entity77 antibodies had been produced			0
all developed such antibodies within four weeks of receiving the vaccine , with levels higher in those who were given the higher - dose vaccine			0
scientists : ' positive ' results in 1st human trial of experimental @entity2 vaccine doctor 's condition worsens a number of the cases of @entity2 outside of @entity38 are of health workers who treated patients			2
in @entity96 , one doctor who contracted @entity2 while treating @entity2 patients in @entity12 has seen his condition deteriorate , according to the @entity98			1
the doctor , whose name has not been revealed , had arrived in @entity101 from @entity12 on tuesday on a special bio-containment military plane			0
his condition was initially stable , but has become worse since friday , the medical institute said , and has been suffering from major gastrointestinal disorders			0
the @entity96 doctor was working for the @entity96 aid organization , @entity106 , and had treated @entity2 patients in @entity12			2
it is not clear how he contracted the virus , the aid organization said .			0
