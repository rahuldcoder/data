-- when @entity0 highlighted some excellent historic restaurants in major cities across the country last month , readers wondered why their small - town and smaller - city favorites did n't make the cut			1
thus , in this follow - up tribute to more laudable veteran restaurants , we 've zeroed in -- thanks to suggestions from our commenters -- on the decades - old , and in certain cases centuries - old , icons that thrive outside of @entity19 's biggest metropolises			1
@entity20 , 1905 the @entity23 / @entity22 family claims the title of @entity26 's oldest restaurant and @entity19 's oldest @entity28 restaurant with their 107 - year - old icon @entity31 in the @entity33 area of @entity34			1
what started as a corner cafe for the cigar workers in town has ballooned into a 1,700 - seat restaurant specializing in @entity41 and @entity28 cuisine			0
live jazz and flamenco shows are offered on most nights , and the gift shop comes complete with cigar rolling demonstrations in the afternoon			0
the restaurant expanded with locations across @entity26 -- including one in @entity51 -- but the locals still stop in here for the famous @entity41 sandwiches , the 1905 salad , tossed tableside and the old - school @entity28 decor			1
@entity59 7th avenue , @entity34 , @entity26 ( 813 ) 248 - 4961 @entity60 , 1895 the supposed originator of the hamburger , @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 , has been serving beef patties on white toast since before buns were even invented			1
legend has it that in 1900 , a customer asked the restaurant 's founder , @entity60 , for a quick meal he could eat on the run			1
he broiled some steak trimmings , put them between two slices of bread , and voila , the burger was born			0
over a hundred years later the lunch wagon has evolved into a squat , @entity80 - looking restaurant , featuring wooden chairs and carved graffiti - ridden tables and a menu offering just four items : burgers , potato chips , potato salad and pie			0
the patties are placed on vertical , antique 1898 cast iron grills that cook the burgers on both sides simultaneously to medium rare			0
and do n't ask for ketchup			0
only three condiments are offered : cheese spread , tomatoes and onions			0
261 - 263 crown street , @entity61 , @entity62 ( 203 ) 562 - 5507 @entity102 , 1893 back in the heyday of logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , companies set up cookhouses to feed their workers			1
these mess halls / community centers offered three hot meals a day ( and cold meals on sundays ) for an affordable price , served family style			0
the @entity115 in @entity102 , @entity116 , began as one such kitchen in 1893 and continues the tradition of serving affordable , family - style meals in a no - frills setting			0
current menu items include @entity124 toast , pancakes and sausage for breakfast , chicken parm and pot roast for lunch , and roast beef , short ribs and ham for dinner			1
those with a strong sense of nostalgia should check out the restaurant 's museum on the second level , which is filled with old photographs along with logging and maritime relics			1
@entity144 , @entity102 , @entity116 ( 707 ) 442 - 1659 smackdown : @entity146 area boasts sandy shores , surrealism @entity149 , 1870 when the @entity149 , the home of famous , affordable and hearty fried chicken dinners , was forced to move locations in 2000 due to a sewage issue , the owners decided to make an exact replica of their former home , one their loyal regulars would recognize			1
the new version , located 40 miles away from @entity149 in @entity158 , @entity159 , includes a rebuilt facade and as many of the old doors and fixtures from the original hotel restaurant , with origins dating back to 1870 , as possible			1
@entity149 stopped welcoming overnight guests decades ago , but the name lives on			0
the chicken dinner , served since the current owners ' great - grandmother originated it in 1915 , includes coleslaw , half a fried chicken , mashed potatoes , creamed corn , biscuits and ice cream , all for $ 15			1
@entity178 , @entity158 , @entity159 ( 785 ) 263 - 2244 @entity179 , 1948 @entity181 , @entity62 , institution @entity179 began back in 1948 as a classic soda fountain and ice cream maker , the offshoot of a dairy farm			1
when the original owners , @entity188 and @entity189 , decided to branch out to lure business in the colder months , they added savory diner staples to their menu -- including a special take on the classic griddle - top cheeseburger featuring a giant crown ( using four slices ) of crispy cheese			1
burgers and homemade ice cream are still served in the old diner today , which was enlarged and renovated over the decades but has kept the same look since 1978			0
@entity202 , @entity181 , @entity62 ( 860 ) 649 - 4245 @entity203 , 1886 @entity203 , founded in 1886 on a site established as a stagecoach stop in the 1860s , is located 20 minutes north of @entity207 , @entity116 , nestled on a mountainside off a winding road			1
its buildings , a group of low log cabins outfitted with fireplaces , taxidermy and animal hides , have been preserved through the decades , making this a local destination , even without much signage or promotion			0
the place is big with bikers , especially on sundays when live music is offered and the @entity222 offers their locally famous tri-tip steak sandwiches			2
5995 @entity224 , @entity207 , @entity116 ( 805 ) 967 - 0066 race for the next presidential birthplace @entity227 and @entity228 , 1728 those looking for an old @entity231 experience should seek out the @entity227 and @entity228 , right in the middle of @entity234 's hunt country			2
founded in 1728 , the inn housed presidents and revolutionary war heroes , was a medical center for the @entity239 during the @entity240 , and has attracted famed guests like @entity242 and @entity243			0
the tavern looks as it might have in the 18th century , with thick stone walls , large fireplaces , beamed low ceilings and long oak tables			0
the menu changes seasonally but features old @entity251 classics like fried chicken , crab cakes and peanut soup			1
2 @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity234 ( 540 ) 687 - 6301 @entity257 , 1925 a guide to old - school @entity19 restaurants would n't be complete without a grand steakhouse , and @entity257 , a @entity263 fixture since 1925 , fits the bill			1
stepping inside the restaurant , located in an unassuming building by the city 's waterfront , is like entering a time warp			2
though @entity272 's began as an outpost selling egg sandwiches to the dock workers nearby , the founders ' son transformed it into a fine - dining chop house with white tablecloths , wood paneled walls and a verbal menu -- servers come around with raw cuts of meat and fish to choose from -- of chops , steaks and seafood			2
it 's not cheap by any stretch , but @entity272 's is a staple in the area and is run by the grandchildren and great - grandchildren of the original immigrant founders			1
1200 north 1st st. , @entity263 , @entity296 ( 314 ) 421 - 6399 chef @entity297 's , 1921 up until the 1980s , when the current owners bought it , chef @entity297 's had no phone number , no signage and survived for 60 years in the basement of an @entity304 row house strictly by word of mouth			2
though it 's a little easier to access now , reservations are still tough to come by , with good reason			2
the setting is unique in that it feels like someone 's home -- until recently diners had to walk through the dishwashing area to get to the bathroom -- and the vibe is that of a large family gathering			2
and then there 's the food : fettuccine in clam sauce , a primal - sized veal parmigiana on the bone , steak charred " @entity330 style , " famed banana cream and caramel ricotta pies , and dozens of others delectables			2
try calling the day of to see if there are any cancellations , and note it 's byob and cash only			2
@entity335 , @entity304 , @entity336 ( 609 ) 345 - 2022 @entity337 closer to home : five @entity19 festivals the @entity340 , 1907 a large contingent of customers have been coming to the @entity340 , a 105 - year - old casual @entity344 / @entity251 restaurant in downtown @entity345 , @entity346 , for decades			1
a large contingent of the restaurant 's workers have been there even longer			2
and its owners , @entity353 and @entity354 , one of whom is there almost every shift , have been keeping the family tradition alive since 1966			0
why all the dedication ? first there 's the fresh seafood , trucked in from the @entity362 daily and served with a @entity344 flair			0
but also , it serves as a community gathering place and hub for @entity345 locals , growing from a 25 - seat cafe to a 330 - seat restaurant over the decades			0
specialties include the seafood gumbo , the @entity344 snapper and the lemon ice box pie			0
304 19th @entity374 , @entity345 , @entity346 ( 205 ) 424 - 9444 where have you had a favorite meal that stands out and brings back fond memories ? ( it does n't have to be fancy			0
