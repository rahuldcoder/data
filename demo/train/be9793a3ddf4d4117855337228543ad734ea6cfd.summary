@entity5 photojournalist @entity11 and @entity13 @entity12 , a " respected teacher " who was to be released on sunday , were fatally shot in the compound by a terrorist as the secret mission unfolded , a @entity5 official said			1
the relief group @entity18 , which was helping secure @entity12 's release , had recently informed his wife that " the waiting is almost over			1
" " three days ago , we told her ' @entity12 will be home for @entity25 , ' " said the group , which identified the @entity13 hostage as @entity12			1
" we certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded			0
" he was an " innocent man , a respected teacher , " @entity12 's wife , @entity30 , said in a video made before his death			1

a video of @entity41 pleading for his life was released earlier this week by @entity44			2
@entity44 gave the @entity5 three days to comply with unspecified demands			0
arrangements for @entity12 's release may have been missed by the @entity49			1
the @entity34 administration assessed that there were two individuals at the location but did not know one was @entity13 or that negotiations were under way for his release , a senior @entity51 official told @entity59			1
@entity12 and his wife were abducted in may of last year , but @entity44 subsequently let his wife go			1
on friday , a team of local leaders was finalizing arrangements to reunite @entity12 with his wife and children , the relief group said in a statement			1
@entity34 's decision the president condemned @entity44 's killing of the two hostages and explained his decision to authorize the rescue attempt			0
" earlier this week , a video released by his terrorist captors announced that @entity11 would be killed within 72 hours , " @entity34 said in a statement			1
" i also authorized the rescue of any other hostages held in the same location as @entity11			1
" secretary of state @entity81 said in a statement that the president had received a recommendation to authorize the operation			0
@entity34 offered his condolences to @entity11 ' family			1

" their despair and sorrow at this time are beyond words			0
" @entity13 's @entity101 expressed its " deepest condolences to the family and friends of mr @entity12 for their loss			1
condolences are also conveyed to the family and loved ones of the deceased @entity5 hostage			2
" ' they lost the element of surprise ' the operation took place friday at 5 p.m. et , a @entity5 official told @entity59			1
on thursday , the @entity1 became aware of enough new intelligence about the location of the hostages to stage a rescue mission , the official said			2
a senior @entity1 official traveling with @entity122 in @entity123 said that the operation was accelerated because there was intelligence that @entity11 would be killed on saturday morning , eastern time			1
@entity34 and @entity122 were briefed the next day			0
two @entity129 aircraft transported a team of about three dozen @entity131 , mainly from @entity132 , and a combat medical team near the captives ' location			0
there were no @entity9 forces with the @entity5 commandos			1
the official traveling with @entity122 said that once the @entity141 landed , the team had to trek about 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) to the compound			2
they were discovered about 100 meters from the location where @entity12 and @entity11 were being held , according to that official			1
the main part of the assault lasted five to 10 minutes			0
" they lost the element of surprise at the last minute as they approached the compound , " the official said			2
it was not clear where the kidnappers were when the firefight started , but the official said that the @entity5 is certain that someone ran back inside the compound and shot @entity12 and @entity11 after the battle broke out			1
the official would not specify how it could be certain of that detail			2
difficult , ' precision ' mission @entity5 forces were on the ground for about 30 minutes , an official told @entity59			1
they stayed for that length of time because the combat medical team was trying to stabilize the two wounded hostages			0
according to another official , the hostages were loaded onto a plane and flown to a nearby @entity5 ship			2
one of the hostages died before reaching the ship			0
drones and fighter jets patrolled overhead during the mission			0
the @entity5 forces that carried out the mission are safe , a @entity5 defense official said			2
both the president and @entity81 praised their valor			0
the hostages were being kept at a location close to one where @entity5 and @entity9 forces had carried out a previous raid			1
this rescue mission was particularly difficult , due in part to @entity9 's sparse population , retired lt. col. @entity196 , global affairs analyst for @entity59 , said saturday			1
@entity196 noted that it would have been difficult for the military to travel a significant distance by air and still maintain the element of surprise in a rescue operation			0
" it has to take precision , " he said			0
" this is like brain surgery			0
" a previous attempt it was the second such attempt by @entity5 forces in two weeks			0
in the first attempt , in november , @entity5 and @entity9 special forces outfitted with night visors embarked on the mission about a few miles from a cave where @entity44 was holding hostages			2
a gunbattle ensued , and the special forces killed all seven abductors and freed eight hostages			0
but the militants had separated @entity41 and four more hostages from the group and moved them to another location two days before the raid			0
this week , @entity44 released a video threatening to kill @entity11 and showing the @entity5 photojournalist pleading for his life			1
a spokesman read a statement saying @entity41 would be killed if @entity230 did not meet the terror group 's demands			0
the spokesman did not name the demands but said the @entity5 government knew what they were			0
pleading for his life @entity41 ' brother and mother posted a response video to @entity240 in which they pleaded with the militants to spare him			0

please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for @entity11 , and we mean no harm to anyone , " @entity243 said			2
@entity249 thanked his captors for taking good care of him , but also asked her son be returned to her alive			0
" please show mercy and give us an opportunity to see our @entity11 again			2
he is all that we have , " she said			0
@entity256 , a former freelance journalist , met @entity11 when they were both in @entity9			1
" of all the people i met in @entity9 , @entity11 is certainly not the person that should have happened to , " @entity256 told @entity59			1
" he was passionate about the country , its people , and he was just a very thoughtful , quirky guy			0
" @entity256 is now a desk assistant for @entity264 , and he wrote about @entity41 on saturday morning on @entity264 's website			0
" i did n't know him particularly well but we did cross paths about a dozen times , " @entity256 said			2
