-- novelist @entity1 walked out of a @entity3 jail thursday , eight years after he was convicted of murdering his wife			1
a jury convicted @entity1 in october 2003 of murder , siding with prosecutors who argued he had bludgeoned @entity8 to death in the stairwell of their @entity12 home			1
but on wednesday , judge @entity13 ruled that @entity1 deserved a new trial and finding that @entity16 agent @entity15 had misled jurors about bloodstain evidence			1
@entity15 was fired by the agency last january			2
@entity1 addressed the press after being released thursday on bond			2
" i have waited over eight years -- 2,988 days as a matter of fact ... for an opportunity to have a retrial , " @entity1 said , while surrounded by family			1
" i want to thank judge @entity13 for giving me that opportunity so that i can vindicate myself and prove my innocence , in a fair trial this time			2
" his son , @entity31 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity32 that he was happy to hear thursday that his father could get out of jail -- in contrast to his feelings after the verdict came down			0

@entity1 is still charged with her murder , and this is still in the hands of the justice system			0
" @entity1 , now 68 , had made a frantic 911 call on december 9 , 2001 , about his wife of five years			1
police initially believed @entity8 died as a result of an accidental fall down a flight of stairs , but the sheer volume of blood at the scene and a coroner 's report that she had several head lacerations changed their minds			0
sixty - five witnesses testified , and more than 800 pieces of evidence were presented , over the course of @entity1 's three - month trial in 2003			1
the jury of five men and seven women deliberated 15 hours over five days before reaching their decision			2
