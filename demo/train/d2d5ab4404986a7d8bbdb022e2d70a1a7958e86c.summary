-- less than a year before it stages the @entity2 , @entity1 is once again in the news for the wrong reasons			1
@entity1 football players protested wednesday and said they could take more action -- possibly " drastic measures " -- if their confederation does n't make changes to the country 's overcrowded calendar			1
they want , among other things , more vacation time , longer preseasons , fewer games and a bigger voice in decision making			1
in some matches , the players crossed their arms before the opening whistle			2
in others they did so after the whistle blew			0
and in some instances , they passed the ball from one end of the field to the other after the referees threatened to give players yellow cards			0
also in a game , players from both sides unfurled a banner in the middle of the pitch while the national anthem played			0
it read : " for a football that is better for everyone			0
" in a statement , @entity42 -- not a club but a movement symbolizing the changes the players want -- said on its @entity47 page : " if there are attempts to prevent players from expressing themselves in a peaceful way , drastic measures will be taken			1
" we expect an official position followed by moves that will benefit @entity1 football			2
" according to @entity1 media , the future measures could include players crossing their arms for a longer period of time , wearing red clown noses or even halting a game			1
there was no official reaction on friday , which is a national holiday in @entity1			0
the protests came two weeks after a former professional football player was found decapitated in @entity68 .			0
