@entity0 -- federal safety investigators said tuesday they fear flaws found in @entity0 's @entity5 subway system after a deadly crash this summer may endanger other transit systems , and they sent out an urgent recommendation asking that other rail operators check for similar problems			1
investigators are shown at the crash scene in @entity0			0
nine people were killed in the june 22 wreck			2
in letters to federal regulators , the @entity15 said " all rail transit operators and railroads should be informed " about system flaws that could cause a track circuit to fail to detect a train			1
it was not clear how many rail systems have similar train detection systems			1
neither the @entity15 nor the @entity26 had a list of systems that use the " audio frequency track circuits " that are the focus of the probe			0
but an @entity26 spokesman said that because it does n't know how many operators use the systems , " we are sending today 's urgent recommendation to all rail transit operators , and will identify the pertinent operators through a later survey			2
" meanwhile , the @entity39 , which regulates @entity40 and more than a dozen commuter rail systems , said it also will follow the @entity15 guidance but believes the number of impacted systems will be " limited			1
" nine people were killed and 52 taken to hospitals june 22 when a southbound @entity47 train struck the rear end of stopped train just north of the @entity51 station			1
investigators say an automatic train protection system did not detect the stopped train , so the moving train did not receive a command to slow or stop			0
the @entity15 said it is continuing its investigation into the precise causes of the crash , but it said the investigation has raised concerns that the track circuit is susceptible to errant signals			2
in its letter to regulators , the @entity15 said it discovered one circumstance in which an unintended signal path could be created , resulting in a track relay remaining energized even though a stopped train was occupying the circuit			0
" after only three months , this complex investigation is far from complete , so we are not ready to determine the probable cause of the [ @entity5 ] accident , " @entity15 chairwoman @entity70 said			1
" however , our findings so far indicate a pressing need to issue these recommendations to immediately address safety glitches we have found that could lead to another tragic accident			0
" the @entity15 sent letters to @entity5 , the @entity26 , the @entity39 and @entity82 , which acquired @entity83 , the manufacturer of some of the equipment .			0

@entity15 , investigating fatal @entity0 train crash , cites flaw in train detection system
@entity15 tells other transit systems to look for flaw
it 's not clear how many rail systems have this type of detection system
causes of june 22 d.c. @entity5 crash still under investigation
