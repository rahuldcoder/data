the decision by the @entity2 administration to intervene militarily in @entity3 to prevent a potential " genocide " against a religious minority , could potentially strain relations with @entity7 , who constitute the overwhelming majority of @entity7 in the @entity10 and wider @entity12 world			1
the @entity13 has stepped in to protect the @entity15 minority , and to stem the mass expulsion of @entity17 from their towns by the @entity20 offshoot , @entity19 -- which is now calling itself the " @entity21 " or " is			1
" most @entity23 and @entity12 - majority nations have expressed their concern about the ascendancy -- and brutality -- of @entity19 in @entity3 , and have designated it as a terrorist organization			1
however , the framing of the @entity13 intervention in " humanitarian " and religious terms is likely to bolster several , related narratives that claim that the @entity13 formulates its foreign policy based on an unwritten commitment to certain religious groups and sects -- especially @entity17 and @entity36 -- and an animus towards other ones ; muslims in general but especially @entity7			1
the more corrosive narratives morph into outlandish conspiracy theories that weaken @entity13 standing in the @entity10 and beyond and further inflame the sectarianism that was ignited by the war in @entity45 and that has spread across the @entity12 world			2
just as importantly , these accounts have been adopted by @entity19 and other militant , @entity49 groups to bolster their recruitment efforts			0
in short , they threaten to undermine @entity13 interests and national security			0
the notion that the @entity13 is at war with @entity57 has its roots in the @entity61 - @entity60 conflict			2
generations of @entity23 -- muslims and otherwise -- have been politically socialized to view the @entity13 as the main patron of @entity61 , which is portrayed as a brutal " @entity67 " state that has subjugated @entity60 and " stolen " their land			1
however , it was the war against @entity69 in 2001 , and subsequent invasion of @entity3 in 2003 that framed the narrative more clearly in the minds of many as a general @entity13 war against @entity7 everywhere			1
as the war in @entity3 became protracted , and a @entity36 - led government came to power , displacing the @entity7 minority that had long dominated @entity3 politics , some mainstream @entity7 , as well as militants , started speaking about a " @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity67 " alliance ( the @entity13 , @entity83 , and @entity61 , respectively ) that was conspiring against @entity7			1
@entity20 's branch in @entity3 succeeded in recruiting militants to fight the @entity13 and @entity89 's government by portraying him as an agent of @entity83 , a @entity36 theocracy committed to the subjugation of @entity7			1
however , it was the civil war in @entity45 , where the @entity94 - led regime of @entity95 , brutally suppressed the @entity7 majority , killing more than 100,000 people and displacing millions of others in the process , that allowed @entity20 to craft a jihadist narrative that has resonated with militants around the world and made @entity45 their favorite destination			0
it is in that fertile ground that @entity19 emerged and subsequently flourished			0
within minutes of president @entity2 's statement explaining his two primary reasons for the intervention in @entity3 -- the other being protecting @entity13 personnel and facilities -- arabic social media sites and discussion forums on the @entity113 were inundated with postings expressing a combination of disappointment , dismay and even anger			1
many lamented the prospect of another @entity13 " invasion " of @entity3			1
more pronounced was the tone of incredulity at the perceived unjust , double standard that the @entity13 was displaying by acting in @entity3 after it had refused to stop the carnage in @entity45			2
in the minds of many , @entity13 military action to protect @entity3 yazidis and @entity17 , revealed @entity13 " compassion " for @entity17			1
many asked rhetorically , " does the suffering of @entity45 not count ? " the timing of the president 's decision was a further complicating factor , coming on the heels of the latest round of violence between the @entity61 government and the @entity49 group @entity139 in @entity140			0
the conflict dominated news cycles since it began on july 8 , with images of dead @entity60 children broadcast on satellite news channels around the clock and shared thousands of times on @entity148 and @entity149			0
a common sentiment was outrage at the perceived " silence " of the world			0
elaborating on his reasons for authorizing the attacks in an interview over the weekend , president @entity2 said " we 're not going to let them create some caliphate through @entity45 and @entity3			0
" while the recent declaration by @entity19 leader @entity162 that the " caliphate " had been reestablished -- and that all @entity7 had to pledge allegiance to him -- fell on deaf ears across the @entity12 world , president @entity2 's seemingly inadvertent use of the word caliphate reminded some of president @entity170 's ill - advised use of the term " crusade " in the wake of the september 11 attacks to describe his " war on terrorism			2
" while the use of such words is seen as unfortunate but largely innocuous in the @entity180 , in the @entity10 and much of the wider @entity12 world , moments like these breathe life into otherwise baseless conspiracies for generations			0
those who are familiar with the dominant narrative in @entity187 understand that when it comes to @entity13 officials , there is no such thing as a " slip up "			0
for its part , @entity19 and its sympathizers created multiple hashtags on @entity148 within minutes of the president 's announcement			0
while some promised that a " calamity will befall " the @entity13 , others stressed that the air strikes were just the latest in a long string of @entity13 crimes against @entity7			0
to avoid perpetuating these destructive narratives , the @entity13 must be careful in how it frames the intervention going forward			2
to avoid alienating over a billion @entity7 around the world -- making some of them easy prey for @entity19 and other militant organizations -- the @entity13 should avoid using religious terminology and deemphasize the religion of both the victims and the aggressors			1
what the @entity13 can realistically do in @entity3 why does the @entity13 intervene militarily in @entity3 but not in @entity45 ?			2

the @entity13 has stepped into @entity3 to protect the @entity15 minority and stem the expulsion of @entity17
@entity217 says most @entity23 and muslim - majority nations are concerned by @entity19 ' rise
but framing the intervention in religious terms bolsters theories of @entity13 bias , he says
@entity227 should deemphasize the religion of the aggressors and the victims , he says
