if the crowds under @entity2 ' @entity1 get you down , try @entity4 in @entity5			0
it may not have the history of the @entity9 construction , but at least the coffee will be cheaper			0
or you could head to @entity12			0
or several other locales with their own " @entity15			1
" the replication of tourist attractions has been gaining traction in recent years			0
most recently , a @entity20 company has been employed to replicate @entity22 's ancient pharaonic tombs			1
opening to the public later this month about half a mile from the original tomb in @entity27 's @entity26 , the replica will be located outside the house of @entity29 , the expedition leader who disinterred the pharaoh almost a century ago			1
the reconstruction is a response to the threat posed by the hundreds of thousands of tourists traipsing through the real relic every year			0
changes in temperature and humidity caused by their presence in the burial chamber have caused the striking plaster - painted murals on the walls to begin crumbling away			1
@entity46 's new tomb the solution was for the @entity49 - based company @entity48 to create replicas of @entity46 's and the other pharaonic tombs , including @entity52 and @entity53 , as a philanthropic exercise granted permission by @entity22 's @entity56 in 2009			1
the firm used minutely detailed , hi - tech techniques honed on reproductions over the past decade , including copies of the pharaoh @entity63 's tomb in 2003 and , more recently , of @entity65 's painting " @entity66 " and @entity69 's " inspiration of @entity68			1
" the replication of @entity46 's and the other royal tombs represents the company 's most ambitious project to date , as well as being the most detailed large - scale facsimile project ever undertaken , @entity48 says			1
more : @entity76 's most beautiful bank buildings special 3d scanning systems were developed for the job , allowing the burial chamber to be measured at 100 million points every square meter			1
the resulting 3d relief of the tomb was then reproduced on casts that were finished by hand			0
" is it exactly the same as viewing the real tomb ? no. but what you can do is exceedingly high , " @entity89 , @entity48 's director , told @entity90			2
" you can ' rematerialize ' the quality of the original at a normal viewing distance , so the experience is visually identical to standing in the tomb			0
" it 's not an exercise in faking but [ partly about ] revealing the condition of the original to allow it to be monitored			2
" it 's estimated that 500,000 visitors a year will visit the replica relics , the resulting funds going in part towards preserving @entity22 's real heritage sites			1
cool copy cats copying an ancient monument has an obvious appeal			1
you get to keep the original version , as well as all the tourists -- and their revenue -- threatening to destroy it			2
that same motivation lay behind making giant copies of the @entity119 and @entity118 in @entity20 and @entity9 , respectively , when exposure to the elements , and awestruck visitors ' breath , threatened to turn the vast galleries of prehistoric paintings they contain into mold			2
the motive for replicating other tourist attractions around the world , however , seems less concerned with their heritage value			0
if you think the @entity1 is intimately associated with @entity2 , for example , you may be surprised to find more or less life - size versions of it in @entity13 , @entity12 , @entity136 , @entity5 ( two , actually -- in @entity137 and @entity4 ) and @entity138 , @entity139			1
more : 14 great literary hotels the @entity141 , one of @entity136 's great tourist sights , is no longer one of just @entity136 's great tourist sights			0
a full - sized replica of the @entity148 emperor @entity147 's monument to his beloved third wife has sat outside the @entity152 capital , @entity153 , since 2008			1
@entity136 has taken revenge , of a sort -- it 's planning an @entity156 for the banks of the @entity158			2
@entity160 's " @entity159 " when it comes to art , anatomically accurate copies of @entity160 's " @entity162 " expose themselves everywhere from the @entity165 to the @entity167 state of @entity168 and @entity169 , @entity170			2
in @entity5 , the @entity172 of replicating countries , you can even take home your own fairly convincing @entity175 or @entity177 from the @entity179 oil painting village , a neighborhood of @entity4 famed for its fakes			0
@entity5 , moreover , has recreated entire foreign locales with tourist appeal , such as @entity184 , in @entity185 , and @entity186 , an " @entity190 " mountain village in that famous yodeling province of @entity189			0
what , you can only ask , is next -- a @entity5 @entity192 or @entity193 ? and would anybody go ? facsimile tourism -- as good as the real thing ? let us know in the comments .			0

minutely detailed replica of @entity22 *boy* king 's burial chamber opens to public in @entity22 this month
hi - tech reproduction technique involved scanning 100 million points per square meter
monument - copying business seems to be going strong but some copies -- *multiple* @entity213 and @entity15 -- are less convincing
