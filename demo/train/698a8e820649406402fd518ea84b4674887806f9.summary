-- should he stay or should he go ? @entity2 insist @entity3 will still be wearing a red shirt next season but the @entity7 winger , courted by @entity8 , has refused to rule out a move to @entity10			1
@entity3 has refused to commit himself to @entity2			1
@entity11 presents five reasons why @entity3 should stay at @entity2 and five reasons why he should move to @entity8			1
let us know what you think below			0
stay : loyalty : @entity2 took a huge risk when they signed @entity3 as an unproven 18 - year - old for what seemed a vast sum of $ 25 million in 2003			1
since then , under the tutelage of @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity3 has developed from a raw talent more famous for his stepovers into the most effective and consistent player on the planet			2
@entity2 also stood by @entity3 when he was widely blamed in @entity29 for getting his club mate @entity30 sent off during the 2006 @entity31			1
at 23 , @entity3 owes his best years to @entity2 , the club that has helped him fulfil that potential			1
he has almost four years left on a contract worth $ 240,000 a week -- making him @entity2 's best paid player -- and he should honor it			2
glory : having dominated the @entity38 for the past two seasons and won last season 's @entity40 , @entity2 are a club in the ascendancy			2
with a young team boasting the attacking talents of @entity3 and @entity30 , outstanding young prospects such as @entity44 and @entity45 and a solid defense built around @entity47 and @entity48 , @entity2 could be the preeminent force in @entity53 football for seasons to come			2
if football is primarily about winning trophies , rather than money or lifestyle , then @entity3 should stay where he is			0
the @entity38 : the @entity38 is the most watched football tournament on the planet and increasingly the stage on which the world 's best players want to showcase their talents			2
it was no coincidence that three of last season 's four @entity40 semifinalists came from the @entity38			0
this week the current world footballer of the year , @entity69 , has been linked with a big money move to @entity71			2
@entity8 may be the @entity72 champions and one of the world 's most famous clubs , but @entity2 are currently the biggest club in the biggest league in the world			1
continuity : leaving a club is always a risk and there is no guarantee that a player will settle successfully into a new set - up in a different country , as @entity87 has discovered at @entity88			0
at @entity89 , @entity3 is the undisputed star with a system built around him and teammates working for him			0
at @entity8 he would be one ego among many			0
@entity8 's @entity94 midfielder @entity93 has already warned that @entity3 's arrival on a massively inflated salary would not be welcomed by other squad members : " it would be bad for the dressing room if he gets a much higher salary than the rest of the squad			1
it 's not important to me but i know other teammates would not like that at all			0
" injury : having been carrying an ankle injury since march , @entity3 finally went under the knife earlier this month and is expected to be sidelined until at least october -- long after the summer transfer window has closed			0
@entity3 should be concentrating on getting back to full fitness as quickly as possible rather than worrying about a possible transfer			0
a move to a new club would also likely put him under more pressure to play before he has made a full recovery			0
go : a fresh challenge : @entity3 has achieved everything he can in @entity29 football after two near perfect seasons at @entity89 , winning back - to - back @entity38 titles and player of the year awards and a @entity40 winner 's medal			2
if the 23 - year - old is to continue developing he needs to find new challenges ; what bigger challenge than joining @entity8 -- the club of the " @entity131 " -- for a world record transfer fee ? @entity24 : the former @entity2 assistant manager was a big influence on @entity3 's career and an important mentor figure			1
with @entity24 departing to coach the @entity7 national side , will @entity89 hold the same appeal for his protege ? @entity3 has said he is prepared to " upset " @entity23 and admits he has not spoken to the @entity2 manager in weeks while apparently taking advice from former national team coach @entity142 -- now managing @entity2 's biggest rivals @entity71			1
money : @entity8 are apparently prepared to make @entity3 the most expensive and best paid player in the world			1
a transfer fee of around $ 140 million would smash the $ 92 million @entity8 paid for @entity149 in 2001			0
on top of that , @entity3 could command wages of up to $ 400,000 a week			0
by comparison , @entity2 have said they are not prepared to renegotiate @entity3 's current deal worth $ 240,000 a week			1
in an industry driven by money , @entity3 should go where he can command the highest wages			0
lifestyle : it 's a long way from the sun - drenched beaches of @entity3 's home island of @entity164 to the dreary gray skies of the northwest of @entity29			0
@entity8 may not have any beaches either but at least the weather and the food are more familar and it 's a lot closer to home			0
as a city , @entity8 is far better suited to @entity3 's southern @entity53 temperament than @entity174			1
@entity8 : @entity2 may be big but @entity8 are in a league all of their own			1
with nine @entity177 and 31 @entity72 titles to their name , @entity8 's achievements are unrivalled			0
having written himself into @entity2 folklore , @entity3 has the opportunity to do the same on the @entity184 pitch once graced by the likes of @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			2
@entity3 may already have done enough to win this year 's world footballer of the year award but a move to @entity8 would likely seal that honor : in recent years @entity192 , @entity149 , @entity193 striker @entity3 and @entity194 have all won the honor while wearing the most famous white shirt in sport .			1

@entity3 linked with big move from @entity2 to @entity8
move would likely make @entity7 forward the world 's most expensive player
@entity2 have urged @entity3 to stay , say moving to @entity10 would be a *mistake*
