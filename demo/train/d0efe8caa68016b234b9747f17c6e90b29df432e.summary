@entity0 won the @entity2 for the best goal of 2014 , but was the @entity5 's strike -- which came in front of thousands at @entity8 's @entity7 , with millions around the world watching on tv -- really the year 's best effort ? @entity0 was gracious enough to say that @entity13 's fabulous volley , which took second place at @entity16 's glitzy ceremony monday , just might have trumped his goal against @entity18 at the @entity19			1
fewer than 100 people were there when @entity22 collected the ball with her back to goal , flicked it over her head and crashed it home while playing for @entity31 against @entity32 in a @entity34 game on a gray afternoon in @entity36			1
nevertheless , her brilliant goal -- filmed by chance -- beat @entity41 's flying header for @entity42 against @entity43 at the @entity19 into third place			1
@entity45 forward @entity0 hailed @entity22 's effort as " a golazo " and told reporters : " the pity is that only one can win			1
" he was n't the only one to voice such sentiments , with @entity52 legend @entity51 describing her as the " moral winner			0
" " she is great , " @entity51 added			0
" she needs to score another one for next year			0
that is what i would say to her			0
" the award , voted for by the public , saw @entity22 take 33 % of the vote , with winner @entity0 on 42 % and @entity63 some way back on 11 %			1
the 25 - year - old @entity66 international striker , currently playing for @entity68 club @entity67 , said she was disappointed not to have scooped the ultimate prize			2
" being a footballer , i wanted to win , " she explained			0
" when you have people telling you it 's such a great goal -- people who know a lot about football -- it gave me the hope that i could win it			2
" but the achievement of getting here is fantastic , and it is something that i will remember forever			0
right now it 's a little bit raw , but @entity0 is a great player and he deserves congratulations			2
