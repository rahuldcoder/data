-- @entity1 is apparently testing a new subscription feature that would allow users to receive alerts any time a specific friend takes certain actions on the social network			1
@entity8 reports that it has noticed the new feature popping up on friends ' profiles			0
@entity1 told the blog , " this feature is being tested with a small percent of users			1
it lets people subscribe to friends and pages to receive notifications whenever the person they 've subscribed to updates their status or posts new content ( photos , videos , links or notes )			2
" in other words , when you click to subscribe to a user , you 'll get a new @entity1 notification in your notifications bar at the top of the site or on the mobile device of your choosing any time that other user posts content			1
@entity0 : old @entity36 crushed new @entity36 in reader vote we 're not sure yet if you can subscribe to someone who 's not a friend , which is much more stalker - like , or if notifications include likes and comments ( right now , it sounds like they wo n't )			0
we at @entity0 are hoping this is an opt - in ( or at least an opt - out ) feature			0
@entity0 : @entity51 introduces 10 - way video calling if @entity1 thinks subscriptions are a useful for the majority of average users , people who might want to get special notifications for family members ' or loved ones ' activities , they 're also potentially damaging if rolled out to jealous " frenemies , " vindictive exes or nosy bosses			0
