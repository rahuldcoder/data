it 's a statistic we 've been hearing far too often -- and for far too long			2
two - thirds of @entity4 adults are either overweight or obese -- and the problem is only getting worse			2
even @entity6 , the world 's largest beverage company , is now calling obesity " the issue of this generation			1
" the world 's most valuable brand took the last seat at a crowded table monday , when it launched an ad campaign aimed at " reinforcing its efforts to work together with @entity4 communities , business and government leaders to find meaningful solutions to the complex challenge of obesity			1
" the first commercial of the campaign , a two - minute video called " coming together , " begins with a voice - over : " for over 125 years , we 've been bringing people together			1
today , we 'd like people to come together on something that concerns all of us : obesity			2
" the spots are scheduled to run on television , including @entity35 , beginning this week			2
@entity6 points out in the video it offers 180 low - and no - calorie beverages out of more than 650 beverage products			1
@entity39 has come under increased fire over the past year as a predominant target of an anti-obesity crusade , led in large part by the @entity44 , also known as the @entity44			1
appearing on @entity35 's " @entity45 " in october , @entity46 , executive director of the @entity44 , conceded that sugar and soda consumption are , in fact , on the decline			1
" but , " he said , " the scientific community has ... reached a consensus that soft drinks are the one food or beverage that 's been demonstrated to cause weight gain and obesity			2
and if we 're going to deal with this obesity epidemic , that 's the place to start			2
" global report : obesity bigger health crisis than hunger the @entity44 came out swinging in october , introducing " @entity65 , " -- " an animated short film that encourages @entity4 to pour out their sodas			1
" it stars " @entity65 , " which resemble the iconic @entity6 polar bears			1
the video was directed by @entity70 , the man behind the anti-tobacco " truth " campaign , and features an original song , " @entity76 , " by @entity75 - winning artist @entity74			2
in response , @entity6 issued a statement that read : " this is irresponsible and the usual grandstanding from @entity44			1
it wo n't help anyone understand energy balance , which is key according to recognized experts who 've studied this issue -- a group that does n't include @entity44			1
" in its new campaign , @entity6 drives home the sentiment that " beating obesity will take action by all of us , based on one simple , common - sense fact : all calories count , no matter where they come from			1
... and if you eat and drink more calories than you burn off , you 'll gain weight			0
" the reason soda and other sugary drinks have found their way to the forefront of the so - called " war on sugar " is the harmful rate at which they are absorbed , said dr. @entity106 , a pediatric endocrinologist at the @entity108 , as well as the author of the new book , " fat chance : beating the @entity76 , @entity112 , and @entity113			0
" " the reason to eat your sugar as whole fruit and not juice ( or soda ) ... is because the fiber helps reduce the rate of absorption from the gut into the bloodstream , " @entity106 says			0
" when you juice it , it 's all going to you and your liver gets overwhelmed and you get sick			0
" opinion : @entity106 : a fast - food , sugar fiasco @entity44 , in a statement monday , said the new @entity39 ad campaign is " just a damage control exercise , and not a meaningful contribution toward addressing obesity			1
" " what the industry is trying to do is forestall sensible policy approaches to reducing sugary drink consumption , including taxes , further exclusion from public facilities , and caps on serving sizes such as the measure proposed by @entity146 ( @entity46 ) @entity145			0
" on september 13 , @entity145 , the @entity148 mayor , won health board approval of a proposal to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity157 after the board 's approval of the ban , @entity145 stressed the importance of portion control			2
" i can tell you -- and i think i speak for almost everybody -- if it 's in front of me , i eat it , " said @entity145			0
" i love @entity168 - its			0
if you put a 2 - pound box of @entity168 - its in front of me , i 'd probably eat them all			0
that 's not very good for you			0
but if you eat ( almost ) anything in moderation , there 's no harm			0
" @entity46 told @entity157 that the occasional soda could , of course , be a part of a healthy diet			0
" we do n't want to wipe out soft drinks , " he said			0
" but we would like to see soft drinks return to the dietary role they played in the ' 50s , which was occasionally , and small portions , ( as a ) special treat			0
now , people are guzzling huge containers of soda every day of their lives , practically			0
" opinion : forget large sodas , how about banning @entity195 fries ? this is something even @entity6 can agree is a bad idea			1
the company is in the middle of a roll - out of smaller , portion - controlled sizes of its most popular drinks , and promises to have them in about 90 % of the country by the end of the year			0
" we 've never been more committed to doing our part to help address the issue of obesity , " @entity6 spokesman @entity206 said in an e-mail , adding that " 2013 is going to be a landmark year in terms of expanding partnerships and efforts to educate consumers about energy balance			1
" but perhaps most important is a move @entity6 has already made : the decision to add the calorie counts to the front of their bottles and cans , to make it even easier for consumers to make informed decisions .			1

in a new ad campaign , @entity6 calls obesity " the issue of this generation "
@entity39 has *previously* been a target in an anti-obesity campaign
the @entity44 says the campaign is " damage control "
