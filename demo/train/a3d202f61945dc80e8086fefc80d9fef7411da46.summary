-- @entity1 and @entity2 remained in a standoff early friday , following the @entity6 nation 's decision to grant @entity8 asylum -- a decision @entity11 authorities are refusing to honor , saying they are committed to extraditing the @entity13 founder to @entity14			1
according to the official @entity17 feed of @entity13 -- a website that 's published hundreds of thousands of once - secret @entity20 government documents -- there were " over 35 police surrounding the @entity2 embassy in @entity23 " soon after 12:30 a.m. friday			1
@entity1 's foreign ministry , though , earlier countered that there was a larger " police presence outside the @entity27 in @entity28 " than at the @entity2 mission in @entity23			1
inside the latter embassy is @entity8 , the @entity31 national wanted in @entity14 to face questioning over claims of rape and sexual molestation , as he 's been since first seeking asylum in june			1
what 's next for @entity8 's extradition battle ? on thursday , he thanked his " courageous , independent " @entity2 hosts for protecting him " from persecution , " after its foreign minister @entity41 announced his nation was giving asylum to @entity8 and urged @entity11 authorities to let him travel freely to @entity6			1
outlining why the asylum request was granted , @entity41 said his nation has a credible fear @entity8 -- who was described as an activist for freedom of the press and freedom of expression -- will be silenced if sent to @entity14 and , perhaps eventually , the @entity20			1
the minister specifically expressed concerns that if @entity8 were extradited to the @entity20 , he might face charges of treason or espionage and , if convicted , be sentenced to death			2
in the @entity20 -- where @entity8 has n't been charged with anything , for now -- there are no guarantees @entity8 would receive a fair trial or that he would n't be subject to a military or secret tribunal , @entity41 said			2
" there are strong indications of retaliation by the country or countries who produced the information divulged by mr. @entity8 , reprisals that could put at risk his security , integrity and even his life , " the @entity2 government concluded			2
timeline : @entity8 's extradition battle @entity78 spokesman @entity77 on thursday offered " no comment on @entity8 or the dispute over his asylum between @entity2 and @entity11 authorities			1
" @entity20 attorney general @entity83 has said that the @entity78 is conducting an " active , ongoing criminal investigation " into the @entity13 disclosure of hundreds of thousands of classified @entity20 documents relating to the conflicts in @entity88 and @entity89 and about 250,000 @entity20 diplomatic cables			0
@entity8 and his supporters claim a @entity20 grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him			0
it is unclear if @entity8 could be charged with treason in the @entity20 or what sentence he 'd face if convicted			0
those convicted of treason in the @entity20 may be sentenced to between five years in prison up to death , according to federal law published on the @entity20 @entity103 ' website			0
but the law only applies to those " owing allegiance to the @entity20			0
" a death sentence also can be imposed on those convicted of espionage by communicating certain sensitive information to a " foreign government " or other such faction " with intent or reason " to harm the @entity20 , according to @entity20 federal law			0
but there are death penalty restrictions for that crime			0
like other left - leaning @entity120 leaders such as @entity122 's @entity121 , @entity124 's @entity123 and @entity126 's @entity125 , @entity2 president @entity118 has railed against the @entity20 as an " imperial power that has to be checked , " said @entity128 , a @entity129 international lawyer who 's worked on high - profile cases involving @entity120 , @entity131 and @entity132			2
@entity118 , an economist who earned two academic degrees in the @entity20 and is up for re-election next february , said in an interview with @entity8 earlier this year on the activist 's tv show : " i love and admire the @entity6 people a great deal ... but i will always call a spade a spade			0
" the @entity2 president also has n't hesitated to poke @entity1 , as he did in calling for sanctions in february against that nation over its long - running dispute with @entity147 over who owns the @entity149			0
that @entity11 - @entity2 dispute is the focal point of the current tension , with both nations appearing firm in their positions			2
@entity8 embassy gamble follows famous precedents @entity1 is disappointed by @entity2 's decision and will continue to " carry out ( its ) obligation " to arrest and extradite @entity8 to @entity14 , with the @entity11 @entity159 saying " the @entity2 government 's decision this afternoon does not change that			1
" @entity11 foreign minister @entity163 added his nation wo n't provide safe passage for @entity8 , and that the @entity11 had " painstakingly " assured the @entity2 that his human rights would be protected			1
" it is important to understand that this is not about mr. @entity8 's activities at @entity13 or the attitude of the @entity20			1
he is wanted in @entity14 to answer allegations of serious sexual offenses , " @entity171 said			0
@entity8 was arrested in @entity1 in 2010 because @entity14 authorities wanted to question him about the allegations			0
two women accused him of sexually assaulting them during an august 2010 visit to @entity14 in connection with a @entity13 release of internal @entity20 military documents			0
@entity8 denies the allegations and argues they are in retribution for his organization 's disclosure of @entity6 secrets			0
@entity41 jabbed @entity11 authorities for sending a written notice to @entity2 that they would " assault " his country 's embassy in @entity23 if @entity2 officials failed to hand over @entity8			1
the @entity11 say one of their laws allow for them to enter the embassy and arrest @entity8			1
@entity41 cited a laundry list of international treaties and conventions that he said make it clear that it is illegal to enter another country 's embassy			1
the @entity11 , in effect , is saying " we are going to savagely hit you depending on how you behave , " @entity41 said			2
why @entity8 needs @entity2 and @entity2 needs @entity8 yet the next confrontation may not be at the embassy , but in court			1
" what the @entity11 must do is apply the diplomatic obligations of the ( @entity221 ) @entity220 and let him leave with a safe conduct pass , " said @entity210 , a former @entity211 judge who said he is working pro bono as coordinator of @entity8 's defense team , by e-mail from @entity216 in the @entity217			1
" if not , we will go to the @entity225			0
" @entity210 is a well - known crusading human rights judge who ordered the arrest of @entity228 dictator @entity227 in @entity23 in 1998			0
@entity211 's judicial authority removed him from the bench last february after his conviction in a case in which his home nation 's @entity233 determined @entity210 had improperly ordered wiretaps while investigating a financial corruption case			0
following @entity2 's announcement , @entity14 said it took umbrage to the implication it does not guarantee the rights of those in its custody , and called the @entity2 ambassador there to a meeting			1
opinion : @entity8 's stubborn grip hurt @entity13 " @entity14 does not extradite individuals who risk facing the death penalty , " a @entity14 @entity250 spokeswoman said , implicitly referring to the possibility @entity8 could be charged with crimes eligible for the death penalty in the @entity20 , with whom it has an extradition agreement			1
the @entity14 ministry said on its official @entity17 account that this was an " unacceptable attempt by @entity2 to stop the @entity14 judicial process and the @entity263 judicial cooperation			2
" @entity8 sought refuge at the embassy five days after the @entity233 in @entity1 dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to @entity14 , his last option in @entity11 courts			2
he is subject to arrest for breaking the terms of his bail , which required that he spend his nights at the home of a supporter outside @entity23 , @entity23 's @entity270 said the day after he entered the embassy			0
publicly silent since last march , he 's set to speak at 2 p.m. sunday -- two months to the day since he sought asylum -- according to @entity13 official @entity17 feed			1
that same day , foreign ministers from member states of the @entity285 will convene in @entity286 , @entity2 , to discuss the situation in @entity23 , @entity282 's foreign ministry announced in a statement late thursday			2
@entity2 requested the meeting , after which representatives from @entity285 member states talked and agreed to meet , the @entity282 ministry said			0
fake @entity293 op - ed a @entity13 hoax @entity0 's @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity299 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity13 says via @entity17 that 35 @entity11 police remain outside @entity2 's embassy
