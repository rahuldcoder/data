-- former formula one world champion @entity1 has told @entity0 that he believes the sport 's decision to switch to @entity6 tires for 2011 will suit his style of racing			1
the @entity10 manufacturer are producing tires that are more bio-degradable than previous years , meaning drivers need to place a greater emphasis on the way they handle their cars -- something that @entity1 feels plays to his strengths			1
with the new @entity20 season about to start in @entity21 , @entity1 told @entity23 's @entity22 : " i am good to my tires , it is something i have worked on for many years			1
will new tires decide the @entity20 title ? " for me it is important to be precise with everything i do , the steering , the throttle , the breaks , " added the @entity28			1
" and with these new tires there will be more stability , which is something i really look for in a car , so hopefully it will really help me			0
" @entity1 is taller than @entity40 teammate @entity39 and the cockpit of the @entity42 has been moulded to his specifications , in sharp contrast to last season when the 2010 @entity40 was built around @entity39 's specifications			1
@entity1 said : " last year was a little bit tricky for me to get into the car			2
it was built for @entity39 , who is shorter than me			2
" this new car is fitted around me so i feel a lot more at home			0
i have got my own steering wheel with buttons fitted exactly where i want them , which is a nice feeling			0
" if you do n't feel at home in a car , you do n't feel part of it -- and you need to feel part of it to drive it well			0
" @entity1 has already won one world title but believes he has the ability to add to that 2009 success and has not lost the desire to become champion again			2
" racing in @entity20 , and trying to win , is the most important thing in my life at the moment and to win the world title again would be a great feeling , " said @entity1			1
" but i really do n't know if that would be enough for me			0
you always want more and , at this moment in time , one more world title would be enough for me			0
" but if i do win the world title this year , i think it would be very difficult for me to walk away from the sport			0

@entity1 tells @entity0 that he is happy with the switch to @entity6 tires for 2011
@entity6 have taken over from @entity83 as the @entity20 tire *supplier*
@entity1 also reveals that the @entity86 has been built to suit his own body shape
the @entity28 *confirms* that last year 's @entity40 was built to suit the smaller @entity39
