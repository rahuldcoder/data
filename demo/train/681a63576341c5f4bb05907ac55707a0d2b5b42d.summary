-- before the october 1 rollout of @entity3 , a key concern was whether the @entity5 system would create a " death spiral " for insurers			2
that crisis could be precipitated by an unenthusiastic response from younger , healthier @entity10			0
these are the people whose high premiums and low demand for services are necessary for the risk pools to assume the costs of covering pre-existing conditions at community - pricing rates , as well as buffering the premiums of older and needier @entity10			2
instead , the emerging " death spiral " crisis is one of the credibility for the @entity24 and the idea that big government - program interventions work better than the private sector those interventions seek to reform			1
the @entity30 had 42 months and $ 400 million to create an operational web portal that connects @entity10 who now are required by law to buy coverage from insurers , while connecting to the @entity36 to qualify people for federal subsidies in the exchanges			1
for the last several months , @entity30 and the @entity24 assured everyone that the system development was on track for an october 1 launch			2
@entity44 fought a pitched battle against @entity46 over the last month to keep the @entity46 from forcing a delay of the rollout			1
now , suddenly , the idea of a delay has moved from the ramblings of " anarchists , " as @entity53 described @entity5 opponents , to mainstream @entity44 thought			1
sen. @entity56 , a @entity57 from deep - blue @entity58 , told a panel on @entity60 on thursday that the mandate needs to be delayed , depending on " how soon these glitches are going to be solved			2
" that will depend , @entity56 said , on " leveling with the @entity10 people			0
" that honesty has been in short supply			0
more than two weeks into the crisis , hhs secretary @entity67 told @entity0 's @entity69 that president @entity70 had no inkling of the failure until he read about it in the papers , which follows a pattern of denials at the @entity24			0
@entity67 also implied that the failure took her by surprise too , even though the @entity5 was her agency 's highest priority over the last 42 months , and the system failed a light - load test days before the launch			1
@entity67 must have also missed the august report from the @entity30 inspector general pointing out major flaws in the system and its testing , even though @entity88 managed to notice it			0
even former @entity24 press secretary @entity90 called the notion that the @entity24 did n't know about the @entity93 problems " unbelievable , " while @entity95 's @entity94 called it " either a lie ... or an unfathomable lack of oversight			1
" it could also be both , which is the possibility that now has @entity44 doing a 180 and suggesting or demanding delays in the rollout			1
constituents fear dealing with @entity36 penalties for failure to buy insurance through a system they ca n't access and @entity30 ca n't fix , or even predict when it will be fixed			0
even those who have managed to buy insurance through the site now have to wonder whether their insurers have their correct data			0
meanwhile , @entity70 and @entity67 now want to reassure @entity10 that they have a grip on the problem ... by bringing in the private sector to fix what the government failed to execute			2
rarely have we seen such a confluence of incompetence , irresponsibility , and prevarication all at the same time			0
the death spiral of @entity24 credibility wo n't just damage democrats in the short run , but it will damage the agenda of advocates of activist government for years			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			0

@entity134 : *obamacare* site launch has hurt administration 's credibility
he says it spent $ 400 million to create working site , failed and is now *obfuscating* about it
he says even @entity44 *skeptical* *officials* did n't know site not ready to be *unveiled*
@entity134 : @entity44 credibility is damaged , idea of government - program interventions is , too
