-- the renewed bloodshed and defiant protests in @entity3 prompts a provocative question : could @entity3 really collapse ? just two years into a revolution that ignited during the @entity6 , @entity3 's defense minister warned this week the raging conflict " may lead to the collapse of the state and threaten the future of our coming generations			1
" on wednesday , analysts described that statement as overreaching , but none dismissed the severity of the country 's problems			1
" his comments were a bit over the top , " said @entity20 , a fellow at the @entity21			1
" it depends on what your definition of what ' collapse ' is , " added @entity26 , senior fellow for @entity28 studies at the @entity29			2
" the economy is certainly in terrible shape			0
" @entity38 , director of global education at @entity40 in @entity41 , said the comment by defense minister gen. @entity43 was " a bit of an overreaction			1
" " but five days of riots and tens of deaths and thousands of demonstrators still in @entity51 two years after the fall of ( @entity47 ) @entity47 , i can understand why he would say it			0
" analysts agreed that the remarks should serve as an alarm			2
" it was a warning to everybody -- the opposition , the @entity61 -- that they 've got to get their act together , " said @entity0 correspondent @entity56 in @entity57			2
he was referring to the @entity61 , the @entity63 party to which president @entity64 belongs			0
the military -- the powerful bulwark for @entity3 secularism that temporarily governed the country after the revolution ousted longtime ruler @entity47 -- is worried about civil war			1
" this is a telegraphed message to everybody that this is getting out of control , " @entity56 said			2
@entity76 secretary of state @entity77 also addressed the defense minister 's warning of a collapse			1
" i hope not , " she told @entity0 tuesday			0
" that would lead to incredible chaos and violence on a scale that would be devastating for @entity3 and the region			1
" @entity64 's government needs to understand that the revolution 's aspirations " have to be taken seriously " and that " the rule of law applied to everyone , " she said			1
" it 's very difficult going from a closed regime -- essentially one - man rule -- to a democracy that is trying to be born and learn to walk , " @entity92 explained			1
" i think the messages and the actions coming from the leadership have to be changed in order to give people confidence that they are on the right path to the kind of future they seek			1
" exacerbating the political crisis is @entity3 's woeful economy , where the lifeblood of tourism is all but dead and the currency is devalued , analysts said			1
recent demonstrations in @entity116 and nearby cities along the @entity118 are symbolic because that region was among the first where the @entity47 regime lost control during the 2011 unrest leading to revolution , analysts said			2
the region has long felt distant from @entity57			0
demonstrators this week ignored the curfew @entity64 imposed on the region following bloodshed on the second anniversary of the revolution last friday			0
protesters fed up with slow change clashed with authorities , leaving seven people dead			2
rage exploded again when a judge sentenced to death 21 residents of @entity116 for their roles in a deadly soccer riot last year			0
at least 38 people were killed in the two days of violence after the verdict			2
the defense minister denied reports that the army used live ammunition on the protesters , state - run media said			1
" what struck me this time was the call for emergency law and emergency measures , and it was just ignored , " @entity26 said			0
" the people in @entity116 were demonstrating and just thumbed their nose at the government			2
" protesters behind the @entity3 revolution now feel betrayed , particularly as the state security agency was changed in name only to homeland security , @entity20 said			1
no one from @entity47 's coercive security apparatus was sentenced for any violence during the revolutionary rallies , he said			0
protesters now just throw rocks at police during most encounters , he added			0
" this all boils down to something very basic , " @entity20 said			0
" the people demanded real change in @entity3 but were lied to and their wishes were postponed and they were told they were n't important			1
" and the generals went around and created this exclusivist coalition ( with @entity64 's government ) , which is what people were protesting against in the first place , " @entity20 said			1
in fact , protesters began calling @entity181 , " a reference to the late @entity184 fascist dictator @entity183 who was @entity185 's ally			0
that nickname arose after @entity64 gave himself sweeping powers in november			0
@entity64 later canceled most of those powers following demonstrations			0
that turn of events hurt @entity64 's image because he was enjoying international attention for playing a constructive role in the recent , bloody conflict in @entity196 between @entity197 and @entity199 forces , analysts said			1
the stakes are high for a country strategically positioned in @entity28 politics and in world trade through the @entity118			0
" i do n't think the international community can afford for ( @entity3 ) to collapse economically ... or politically , " @entity26 said			1
the defense minister 's warning is " very important " because " it shows the military has been in consultation about this			1
that 's why i take it more seriously , " @entity26 added			0
in the coming month , @entity3 will go to the polls to elect a lower house in @entity214			2
the election will be a bellwether on how @entity64 's @entity61 now stands against the opposition coalition @entity218 , analysts said			2
" they are smart people , " @entity20 said of opposition leaders , " but the problem is that they do n't seem like they want to have a real democracy either			0
" for now , the @entity3 military does n't appear to want to intervene and run the @entity3 government again as another president is selected			1
" if the situation deteriorates further , the military might not have a choice and it might find a warm reception , " @entity26 wrote on his blog for the @entity29			0
in a revolution , the first government typically does n't stay in power , as seen in the @entity236 and @entity237 revolutions , @entity38 explained			0
" usually it gets replaced by more radical elements of society , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity241 contributed to this report from @entity116 , @entity3			1

@entity3 's raging conflict " may lead to the collapse of the state , " defense minister says
the remark is a warning that things are getting out of control , analysts say
but *experts* *largely* agree that the remark is " a bit over the top "
@entity3 's government needs to build " confidence " among its people , @entity92 says
