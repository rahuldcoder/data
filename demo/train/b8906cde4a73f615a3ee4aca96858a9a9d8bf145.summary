-- recently it has seemed that every other tweet or @entity3 posted by pop star @entity4 taunts the public with an uncomfortable thought : @entity8 @entity7 , the man who beat her so badly in 2009 that was she was almost unrecognizable , may once again be her lover			1
rumors the two had reconnected began circulating not long after their infamous altercation , which ultimately resulted in @entity7 pleading guilty to felony assault			2
then earlier this year there was the remix to @entity4 's song " @entity19 , " in which @entity7 was the featured guest vocalist offering such coy nuggets as : " girl i wan na --- you right now been a long time i 've been missing your body "			1
ok , maybe " coy " is the wrong word			0
in any case , the couple 's allusions to their reunion -- a @entity30 picture showed her embracing a man who appears to be @entity7 ; another showed a man presumed to be @entity7 face down and shirtless on a bed -- culminated with @entity7 posting a photo of himself and @entity4 , who appears to be in her underwear			1
" what would music today sound like if these kids did n't exist ? " the caption read			0
entertainment : @entity7 ready to start a ' new chapter ' normally i do n't like to get too involved in grown folks ' private business			1
but when you use social media to shove your business down the public 's throat , it 's no longer private			1
@entity4 does n't need to be a spokeswoman for victims of domestic violence , nor does she need to live the rest of her life as a victim			1
but someone needs to send her a copy of " what 's @entity65 got to do with it , " or something , because she 's sending a message that everything is fine and that the man who beat her is " a good man			1
" maybe so , but 77 % of women her age who report domestic violence have been victimized previously by the same man , according to the @entity77			1
this fall , some @entity79 high school students dressed up as @entity4 and @entity7 and reenacted their fight in a school skit for fun			1
when one treats serious matters like this so lightly , does one inadvertently gives permission for others to do the same ? when the world first saw the images of @entity4 's face after her fight with @entity7 , many rushed to blanket the songstress with support			1
the way she is flaunting their relationship now , i do n't anticipate the same amount of sympathy for her if another incident occurs			2
perhaps that 's why she ( preemptively ? ) called her latest cd , " unapologetic			0
" she likely knew she would hear a lot of criticism and i guess she wanted us to know she does n't need our sympathy			2
famed hip - hop author dream hampton recently tweeted that " @entity4 's a dissertation , waiting to be written			2
entertainment : @entity7 renews ' friendship ' with @entity4 at 24 with 12 no. 1 singles and five @entity115 , the singer is already an all - time great in terms of chart performance and sales			1
she 's far more complex away from the mic , often seeming to reveal herself in the 140 characters she uses in her tweets ... with the exception of one song			0
her biggest seller to date , 2010 's " @entity127 , " is a duo with @entity126			0
the song is about a physically abusive , love - hate relationship			0
as @entity126 , who has had his own very public dealings with domestic violence , raps : " you swore you 'd never hit ' em , never do nothing to hurt ' em " @entity4 hauntingly sings : " just gon na stand there and watch me burn well that 's alright because i like the way it hurts ... " after that recording , i thought @entity4 had gotten @entity7 out of her system			1
i guess love , no matter how poisonous it appears on the outside , is a hard drug to recover from			0
since completing a 52 - week domestic violence program , @entity7 has shown about as much control over his temper as @entity148			2
after his 2011 interview with @entity151 on @entity152 -- in which he said his attacking @entity4 is " not really a big deal to me now " -- he reportedly went to his dressing room and trashed the place in anger			2
allegedly , he smashed a window that sent glass falling into the street below , before storming out of the building , shirtless , in 40 - degree weather			0
more than once he 's lost his temper and turned to @entity30 to tell critics to " --- off , " or in the case of comedienne @entity166 , wrote he 'd defecate on her face			0
and then there 's the bar fight with singer - rapper @entity169			0
again , this is a year after anger management			0
oh , i can hear @entity7 fans now -- leave him alone			2
entertainment : @entity7 's creepy new tattoo ' not @entity4 ' listen			1
i grew up with domestic violence all around me -- from close family to friends -- and i tend to believe if a guy hits a woman once , she need n't stick around to see if his apologies are sincere			0
but it 's @entity4 's choice , and apparently she 's not interested in apologizing for the decisions she 's made			1
and if there 's a repeat of 2009 , a lot of us wo n't be interested enough to care			2
after " @entity19 " i 'm not sure if i would care			0
hopefully that incident was a one - time thing and she 'll be alright			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

@entity195 : @entity4 seems reunited with @entity7 , who beat her in 2009
he says pair flaunts their *intimacy* on social media ; @entity4 sending poor message
he says most women who report abuse have been victimized before by same man
@entity209 : it 's her choice , she need n't apologize , but may not be able to count on fans ' sympathy
