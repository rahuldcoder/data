-- @entity1 returned to @entity3 colors after an eight - game ban but the @entity6 striker could n't transform his side 's home fortunes as they were held to a 0 - 0 draw by @entity10 in the @entity11			1
@entity1 's enforced spell on the sidelines came after the @entity14 found him guilty of racially abusing @entity16 's @entity15 , but he could n't break the deadlock in a tense game			2
the point was a blow for both teams as third - placed @entity10 failed to grab a victory that would have seen them close within five points of leaders @entity26 , and three points of @entity16 in second			2
for @entity3 , the draw is their eighth at @entity31 this season -- a run that has hit their chances of qualifying for the @entity36			1
they sit seventh , four points behind @entity39 in fourth			0
after the match @entity3 manager @entity41 suggested @entity1 should n't have been banned in the first place			1
he told @entity44 : " i 'm delighted that he is back			0
he should never have been away but we 've taken the punishment and we 've moved on			0
it would have been unfair to start him , he 's not played since @entity50			0
" heavy fog in @entity3 meant that @entity10 's manager @entity52 was unable to attend the match -- his flight from @entity55 was canceled after he had spent the day in court where he is being tried on a charge of tax evasion			1
the first half offered little in the way of chances , @entity63 's shot that arrowed just wide of @entity10 goalkeeper @entity65 's post the highlight			0
but the game came to life in the second half as @entity65 saved @entity71 's long range shot before @entity1 was introduced on 66 minutes to a standing ovation			0
the striker wasted little time making an impact , but for the wrong reasons , as he was booked for kicking @entity76 in the stomach while attempting a volley			0
@entity1 's strike partner @entity80 wasted a clear chance when he blazed over from 12 yards out after he 'd taken down @entity83 's cross			2
it was @entity10 and @entity86 midfielder @entity85 who had the game 's best chance as he went clean through on goal six minutes from time but he sent his shot straight at @entity92			1
in @entity94 , @entity93 beat @entity95 2 - 1 to climb out of the relegation zone in @entity97			1
@entity99 's opener for @entity93 was canceled out by @entity100 but with nine minutes left @entity101 scored the winner to move the home side into 14th place			2

@entity3 and @entity10 draw 0 - 0 at @entity31 in the @entity11
striker @entity1 returns after eight - match ban for racist *comments*
@entity3 *dominate* but @entity85 squanders a late chance for @entity10
@entity93 beat @entity95 2 - 1 in the @entity97 thanks to @entity101 's goal
