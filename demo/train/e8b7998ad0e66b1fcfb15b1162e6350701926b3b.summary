the @entity1 pipeline represents a big step toward true @entity4 energy independence , reducing our reliance on @entity8 oil and increasing our access to energy from our own nation and our closest ally , @entity13 , along with some oil from @entity15 -- to 75 % of our daily consumption , compared with 70 % now			1
that decades - long goal for our country is finally within reach , but we need to stay focused on the big picture , and we need to act			0
this $ 7 billion , 1,700 - mile , high - tech transcontinental pipeline is a big - time , private - sector job creator , and it will also hold down the gas prices for consumers and reduce our energy dependence on an unstable part of the world			1
finally , it will do so with good environmental stewardship			0
that 's why i , along with 44 of my colleagues from across the nation , introduced new legislation to move the project toward approval and construction after president @entity39 's rejection of the project last month			0
another view : @entity42 on the case against the @entity1 pipeline the @entity46 - @entity45 amendment to the highway funding bill , which we are now working to pass , authorizes @entity49 to construct and operate the @entity1 from @entity50 , @entity13 , to the @entity51 and @entity52 , transporting an additional 830,000 barrels of oil per day to @entity55 refineries			1
this includes 100,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the @entity60 region of @entity61 and @entity62			1
that 's key to my state , because providing pipeline capacity and gathering systems for that much @entity61 crude will take as many as 500 trucks a day off of roads in the oil patch			1
that 's a win - win for producers , state revenues and most importantly , public safety on our @entity77 highways			0
the @entity1 project is good for @entity61 , but it is vital for the nation			2
some 75 % of the pipe for the @entity1 will be made here in @entity4 , 50 % of it in @entity84			1
some 90 % of all other construction materials will come from companies in the @entity55 and @entity13			2
from an environmental perspective , the project has been under review since september 2008 , more than three years , and the @entity91 's environmental review , completed in august 2011 , found " no significant impacts on most resources " providing environmental restrictions are met			1
further , our new legislation includes all federal and state safeguards and sets no time limit on @entity101 's ability to further review the pipeline 's route through the state , the only portion of the route in contention			0
additionally , 80 % of the new @entity13 oil sands development is being developed " in situ , " meaning , it has a similar carbon footprint and emissions as conventional oil wells			2
if the @entity1 pipeline is n't built , @entity13 oil will still be produced -- 700,000 barrels a day of it -- but instead of coming down to our refineries in the @entity55 , instead of creating jobs for @entity4 workers , instead of reducing our dependence on a turbulent part of the world , that oil will be shipped to @entity125			1
it will have to be carried there on large oil tankers , creating more carbon emissions , and it will be processed at facilities with weaker environmental safeguards			2
finally , it 's important to point out that the @entity1 pipeline is nothing new			2
thousands of pipelines crisscross our nation , delivering refined products to fuel our cars , heat our homes and power our industries			0
in fact , the original @entity1 pipeline , which became operational in 2010 , runs from @entity50 through my state of @entity61			2
contrary to claims by critics , the pipeline itself has never leaked			0
the leaks happened at fittings and seals at above - ground pumping stations , which were properly and promptly fixed			0
i have worked toward approval of the @entity1 , first as governor of @entity61 and now as a @entity55 senator , because i believe it helps our nation on so many levels			0
it is just the kind of project that will grow our economy and create jobs in the right way -- through private - sector investment			1
the @entity1 will also help to wean us from our dependency on oil from volatile regions of the world and help us move toward a true energy independent future			1
it will make our nation safer and stronger for the @entity4 people			0
follow @entity171 on @entity172 join the conversation on @entity174			0

@entity1 would take crude oil from @entity13 through @entity51 to @entity52
@entity178 : it will create jobs , help lead to @entity4 energy independence
@entity178 - @entity45 amendment would allow @entity49 to build the pipeline
@entity91 *reports* it will have little environmental impact , @entity178 writes
