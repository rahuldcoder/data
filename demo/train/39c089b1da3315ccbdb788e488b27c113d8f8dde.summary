-- so it looks like president @entity2 got the message			1
in his second debate with @entity5 , the president delivered a comeback performance that will stand as a model for future debaters of how to right a listing ship			1
@entity2 was as good in @entity11 as he was bad in @entity12			2
in fact , this may have been the finest debate of his career and just at the moment when he needed it most			0
@entity0 poll : nearly half say @entity2 won showdown navigating the tricky shoals of the town hall format , the president laid out a persuasive case for re-election , point by point , drawing sharp contrasts with his opponent while avoiding rudeness			1
@entity2 's arguments were not always as succinctly stated as they needed to be , and he too often strayed far from the topic at hand			1
but by the end of the debate , he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of " things i should have done in @entity12			0
" it was @entity2 the community organizer who showed up , a man with a message to sell and an audience to sell it to			2
his interaction with the participants was confident , engaged and energetic , all the qualities he had failed to muster in @entity47			0
he appeared to draw strength from the 82 citizens on the stage , strength that grew as the evening progressed			0
at times @entity5 seemed taken aback by this fresh incarnation of the debater he had bested two weeks ago			2
both substantively and stylistically , @entity5 operated in @entity2 's shadow in this match , second banana to the president 's leading man			1
clearly this was not the role @entity5 intended to play			0
@entity5 's defining moments were too frequently negative			1
his attempts to directly confront the president carried plenty of dramatic charge , but they did n't quite play out the way they must have in rehearsal			0
these maneuvers left an impression more of petulance than leadership			0
' binders full of women ' raises brows the thing that really gets @entity5 exercised in these debates is when he thinks he 's not getting his due , which means he wastes far too much time demanding another minute or the final say or a chance to go back to something from a previous answer			2
@entity5 may believe this assertiveness makes him look strong and in command			0
more likely it reinforces a negative perception that the candidate needs to dispel : that of a plutocrat grabbing every last crumb he thinks he deserves			0
the town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for @entity5 to display this side of himself			2
@entity5 's chief problem was that he did not connect to the audience as effectively as @entity2 did			1
this became apparent every time @entity5 began a response with " i appreciate that " or " that 's an important question , " words that signaled his discomfort with many of the topics the voters wanted to discuss , like equal pay for women , banning assault weapons or immigration			2
@entity2 's big moments were more positive , especially , and unexpectedly , on the topic of @entity112			1
staring daggers at his opponent , the president said it was " offensive " for @entity5 to suggest that the @entity117 had sought political gain from the murder of an @entity121 ambassador and three others			2
when moderator @entity124 backed up @entity2 's version of events over @entity5 's , the president got off one of the few funny lines of the night : " could you say that a little louder ? " opinion : @entity2 bounces back , dominates debate @entity2 also delivered a clever rejoinder in a back - and - forth about the candidates ' personal finances			1
after the president brought up his rival 's overseas investments , @entity5 cited @entity2 's own holdings : " have you looked at your pension ? " " it 's not as big as yours , " came the answer , " so i do n't look at it that often			1
one of @entity5 's lowest points came when a woman in the audience asked him to differentiate between himself and former president @entity147			1
the governor 's response might have been written by the staff of " @entity151 : " " president @entity147 and i are different people and these are different times , " he said			0
" that 's why my five - point plan is so different from what he would have done			0
" not exactly a sound bite for the ages			0
before this debate , i wondered whether @entity2 would acknowledge the elephant in the room : his shoddy performance in @entity47			1
would he make a joke about it , or tell a cute story about what @entity168 had said that night ? turns out he did n't need to			0
@entity2 's performance spoke for itself			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0
