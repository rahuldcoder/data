an @entity1 appeals court convicted former exchange student @entity2 and her ex-boyfriend @entity3 on murder charges thursday night			1
prosecutors said the couple had killed @entity7 in november 2007			0
they were convicted two years later of murder , but those charges were overturned on appeal in 2011			1
a judge said thursday that @entity12 , also convicted of slander , was sentenced in absentia to 28 1/2 years in prison			1
@entity3 's sentence was 25 years			2
@entity12 , who was at home in @entity18 , @entity19 , said her conviction would bring no consolation to the @entity24 family			2
" i am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict , " she said in written remarks			0
" having been found innocent before , i expected better from the @entity1 justice system			2
the evidence and accusatory theory do not justify a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt			0
... there has always been a marked lack of evidence			0
" she called the legal proceedings a travesty			1
" this has gotten out of hand			2
most troubling is that it was entirely preventable , " she said			0
" i beseech those with the knowledge and authority to address and remediate the problems that worked to pervert the course of justice and waste the valuable resources of the system			0
" @entity12 also said that @entity24 's family had suffered greatly			1
" their grief over @entity7 's terrible murder will follow them forever			2
they deserve respect and support			0
" what comes next presiding judge @entity60 has 90 days to write his arguments behind the jury 's ruling			2
once that is out , lawyers have 90 days to appeal			2
@entity12 's attorney , @entity66 , said there will certainly be an appeal and cautioned that extradition should n't yet be a part of the conversation surrounding the case			1
" it 's really not in play right now , because first of all , she has another appeal to the @entity79 of @entity1 , " he told @entity74 's @entity73 360			1
" in @entity1 , under their system , you 're still actually presumed innocent until that third , final stage			2
" @entity66 said that if extradition does become an issue , @entity12 has " very substantial defenses " that can be used			1
" but i think we should n't get ahead of ourselves , " he told @entity74			0
" the bottom line is , there is no evidence			0
there was no evidence , and there never will be any evidence , and that 's why this is such a gross miscarriage of justice			2
" legal analysts debated whether the @entity98 would send @entity12 back to @entity1 if @entity99 requests extradition			1
it is unlikely that @entity12 will return to @entity1 to serve additional prison time because @entity98 law dictates that a person can not be tried twice on the same charge , a legal expert told @entity74			1
" she was once put in jeopardy and later acquitted , " said @entity107 , a former prosecutor who is now a partner at @entity108 in @entity109			0
" under the treaty ( between the two nations ) , extradition should not be granted			0
" @entity74 legal analyst @entity114 said that the @entity98 has to respect the treaty			0
" we have to follow the letter of the law , " he said thursday			0
@entity12 says she wo n't go back @entity24 , 21 , of @entity119 , was found partially nude in a pool of blood in the house she shared with @entity12 in the picturesque town of @entity125 , where both women were exchange students			2
@entity12 has said she is afraid to return to @entity1 , where she spent four years behind bars			1
" i will become ... a fugitive , " she told @entity1 daily @entity129 this month , when asked what she would do if she was found guilty in the second trial			1
@entity1 's @entity79 in march overturned the pair 's acquittals , saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered			1
the case was sent to a retrial in @entity141			0
@entity2 retrial verdict : six things to know ruling unclear the retrial began in september , refocusing international attention on the case that grabbed headlines in @entity1 , @entity119 and the @entity98 -- but neither @entity12 nor @entity3 were present in court			1
both @entity12 and @entity3 have maintained their innocence			2
timeline : kercher murder case ' fugitive ' @entity12 , 26 , and @entity3 , 29 , were convicted in 2009 of killing @entity24 , who was found with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash in her throat			1
speaking on thursday , @entity12 's defense team asked for an acquittal			1
@entity12 has always denied murdering @entity24 and has maintained she is not guilty in a written statement to the @entity141 court			1
" i must repeat to you			0
i did not rape , i did not steal ... i did not kill @entity7 , " @entity12 said in a lengthy e-mail presented by her lawyer to the court in december			1
@entity3 was in the @entity166 at the start of the retrial but returned to @entity1			1
in november , he took to the stand to make a spontaneous declaration , saying the charges against him were " absurd			0
" " for me , it 's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination , " he said of what he 's been through			0
' no one remembers @entity7 ' " they are tired of this long trial and they want justice , " @entity176 , attorney for the @entity24 family , said			0
the @entity24 family welcomed the retrial ruling , @entity176 said in march , adding they believed the ruling that acquitted @entity12 and @entity3 was " superficial and unbalanced			1
" they believe more than one person was in the room when @entity24 was killed , he said			0
" no one remembers @entity7 , while the two defendants write books , speak to the media and earn money , " @entity176 told the court in closing remarks last month			0
