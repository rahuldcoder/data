@entity0 -- @entity3 's victory tuesday over @entity4 capped an unprecedented rise in @entity7 politics			1
@entity3 , addressing supporters after his victory , was an unlikely nominee not that long ago			1
the obscure state legislator with , as he put it , " a funny name " propelled himself onto the national stage at the @entity14 four years ago with a speech so electrifying that commentators declared he would become @entity7 's first black president			0
@entity18 showed that , in this case at least , you can believe the hype			0
but @entity3 did not win the @entity22 on hype , any more than he won it on hope			1
he won it with an organization that even opponents called brilliant			0
he won it with a clear strategy that was stuck to with remarkably little internal drama			0
he won it with unparalleled fundraising and an overwhelming ground game			0
and he won it after facing various challenges and turning them to his advantage			0
turning points winning @entity38 : @entity3 's victory in the @entity38 caucuses knocked almost all of his @entity14 competitors out in the first nominating contest , and it pushed the " inevitable " @entity14 nominee , @entity44 , back on her heels			1
he 'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid january night to debate , harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him			0
tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his @entity38 win and revealed the outline of a general election plan : create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers			0
@entity60 : within weeks of @entity38 , all of @entity3 's @entity14 competitors had dropped out of the race except for @entity63 , who split the races with him in the run - up to @entity66 tuesday			1
it was then that @entity60 , head of the only @entity14 family to outrank the @entity69 , came out for @entity3 , comparing the @entity71 senator to his assassinated brother , president @entity72			1
the move was deeply symbolic , not just for the public but also the party			0
the @entity3 - @entity63 battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of @entity60			1
addressing race : race was always going to be a factor in @entity3 's campaign , even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it			1
clips of the rev. @entity90 , his longtime pastor , making hateful remarks hit the @entity92 and television and put @entity3 on defense			1
he responded with a speech in march hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an @entity7 politician			0
when @entity90 went further , so did @entity3 -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church			2
all this time , black voters were rallying behind @entity3 , switching their allegiance from @entity63 in such large numbers that party elders , such as civil rights icon rep. @entity104 of @entity106 , had to do the same			2
fundraising : flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors , @entity3 announced in june he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976			1
@entity4 hammered @entity3 for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing , but the issue failed to resonate with voters			2
@entity3 kept raising and spending record amounts of money , using it to send staff across the country -- even to dozens of states @entity126 had n't won in years -- and to swamp the airwaves with advertising			1
working with @entity63 : the long and bitter primary battle turned many @entity63 supporters off @entity3			2
a @entity132 poll a month after @entity3 sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of @entity63 's supporters did not plan to vote for @entity3 in november			2
@entity4 tried to exploit the @entity126 ' divisions and attract @entity63 supporters to his side , but the former rivals came together to stop that			0
@entity3 and @entity63 worked behind the scenes to create a show of public unity , epitomized by @entity63 dramatically marching onto the convention floor in @entity144 to call for the party to nominate @entity3 by acclamation			2
the debates : @entity3 won all three debates in the eyes of the public , polling for @entity1 suggested , even if he came up with few , if any , memorable promises or knockout blows			2
the debates showed the classic @entity3 -- thoughtful , deliberate and steady			2
critically , @entity3 made no gaffes , rounding out a campaign that was remarkably free of them			1
@entity3 may have looked an unlikely candidate and an even unlikelier victor only a year ago			1
but his campaign had a different look			0
it started small but with big ideas and worked , inexorably , to make them reality			0
like any candidate , @entity3 faced challenges , but he always seemed to take the path that would make him stronger			0
and , by the end , the campaign and the support was so large , so well organized and so powerful that nothing could prevent @entity3 's march to victory			1
@entity1 's @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 seemed unlikely to be @entity181 nominee a year ago
well - planned and well - executed campaign helped *fortunes* soar
fund - raising , support of @entity187 *important* in his success
