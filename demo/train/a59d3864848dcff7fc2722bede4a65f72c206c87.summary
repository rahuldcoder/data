-- athletes from 97 nations will march in @entity3 tonight at the @entity4 of the @entity5			0
cheer for the sportsmanship and spirit shown at this highest level of competition among the world 's nations			1
a fine example of this sportsmanship happened four years ago , when a ski pole , a race in @entity17 and maple syrup came together			1
it started when @entity22 cross-country ski coach @entity21 performed an extraordinary act			1
on february 14 , 2006 , @entity25 cross-country skier @entity24 began the women 's team sprint competition in @entity28 with something to prove			1
after having placed no higher than eighth in four events at the @entity32 in 2002 , @entity24 was determined to improve her performance in @entity28			0
but in the middle of the final heat , something terrible happened			0
one of her ski poles broke			2
suddenly , all seemed lost			0
four years of intense training for this 17 - minute race were about to amount to nothing			0
then @entity21 saw what happened			2
without giving it a second thought , he handed the @entity25 skier the @entity22 team 's spare pole			1
@entity24 and teammate @entity49 charged forward to finish in second place , earning a silver medal			0
@entity22 ended up fourth -- without a medal			2
an appreciative @entity24 thanked @entity21 with a bottle of wine			2
the @entity25 people , touched by the selflessness of the @entity22 coach , established @entity58 , an organization designed to solicit donations of a @entity25 national treasure			1
in all , 5.2 tons of maple syrup ( 7,400 cans ) were shipped across the @entity63 to @entity64 and then on to @entity22			2
@entity25 also sent thank - you notes and recipes			2
in an instant , @entity64 reminded all those who were fortunate enough to witness his act of sportsmanship that the rings on the @entity75 flag , intended to represent a color of every flag of every nation in the world , are interlocked and interdependent			1
the @entity75 remind the world of the folly in thinking that anyone can stand alone			1
there are times when all people and all nations need a little help , whether that help comes in the form of a charitable donation , a word of encouragement or even a spare ski pole			1
perhaps what is most remarkable about @entity64 's gesture that day was how unremarkable it was to him			0
when asked about his action by @entity99 , @entity21 replied , " it was natural for me to do it , and i think anyone should have done it			0
" @entity64 's act demonstrates why the @entity75 matter : because sometimes -- in spite of skyrocketing salaries for professional athletes , increased illegal drug usage and waning loyalty between fans and their teams -- sometimes sports get it right			1
today , cheer not just for the @entity114 but for the other 96 countries as well			0
cheer because any time so many nations congregate with common goals , under common rules and in peace ought to be cause for celebration			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124 .			0

@entity124 says there are many reasons to cheer @entity75 , which begin today
@entity129 cites sportsmanship shown when @entity22 ski coach helped rival
@entity21 gave ski pole to @entity25 skier whose pole broke
@entity129 : gesture is highest level of sportsmanship in a world grown *cynical* about sports
