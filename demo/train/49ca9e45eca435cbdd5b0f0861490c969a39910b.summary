-- just hours before the first full - scale concert of her current tour , @entity1 stood high above the stage and reflected on the job she 's held for more than four decades			1
" i think it 's as important to enjoy recording and being on the road as much as we do or otherwise i 'd be crazy after 42 years to still be schlepping around in a bus , " she said			1
while @entity1 has performed on and off since 2005 , she put her recording career on hold for seven years to deal with the deaths of her parents and her older brother as well as other issues			1
" the time that i really was off i wanted to literally be off , not thinking of what my next project was going to be , " @entity1 recalled			1
but after a while , the passion @entity1 displays in her music began to fill her again			1
" i got my appetite back for it , and i started going to gigs and really missing it , " she said , later elaborating , " i wanted to take that break so i would miss it enough			1
" as much as @entity1 missed her time off from work , her fans missed her			1
they 've been letting the @entity32 know it , packing concerts and propelling " @entity37 , " her first album in seven years , into @entity36 's top 10			1
as @entity1 's albums typically do , " @entity37 " contains mostly cover songs			1
not that she is averse to original material			0
dating back to her eponymous 1971 debut , @entity1 has written her fair share of music			1
but the woman who @entity46 named as one of the 100 best guitarists and 100 best singers ever is better known as an interpreter of other songwriters ' output			0
@entity1 said when she 's looking for the perfect tunes to record , she relies on a lot of research , hard work and luck			1
" [ @entity58 ] ask my friends -- other musicians i respect -- who they 're listening to that 's kind of under the radar in their town , in their area , " she said			2
" i call people in @entity67 and @entity68 , and go back and listen to my old cds , and vinyl			0
it 's really hunt and peck			2
some of the ones i 've had for a while , and i 'm thinking about waiting for which record will work			0
" the first single off of " @entity37 " is a cover of the late @entity76 's 1978 hit " @entity77			1
" @entity1 attributed that selection to " one of those magical moments			1
" " [ i was ] walking around in a mall or you know , in a restaurant , and that 's how i found the @entity76 song again			2
i remembered how much i loved it , " she said			0
@entity1 said she chose to recast " @entity77 " as " a kind of tougher reggae song			2
" it 's not the first time she 's put a definitive spin on someone else 's hit			2
@entity1 redefined @entity95 's signature hit " runaway , " and some fans have noted that @entity99 's beloved " @entity98 , " which @entity1 still plays during her concerts , seems like it was written for her			1
despite nine @entity102 and several other accolades , @entity1 's remains humble onstage and off			1
before her show , @entity1 joked about her age , noting she needs two pairs of glasses -- one for distance and one for reading			2
she added that when it comes to the latter , she gets cheap ones from the drugstore : " they 're just as good			0
" on stage , she good - naturedly brushed off a marriage proposal from the crowd ( " if you only knew ! thanks for offering " ) , consistently shined the spotlight on her longtime touring band and even played the sideman , letting new keyboardist @entity121 sing a song toward the end of the main set			0
@entity1 protested that she has n't had that many hits ( " that would be daunting if you had like 30 and you had to do most of them all the time			2
it would get kind of old , " ) but she knows certain songs of hers are classics			0
" ' @entity136 , ' ' @entity98 , ' ' @entity137 , ' you know , people who have n't seen me in a long time , they love those songs , and they 're the ones who paid for the tour bus , " she said			0
while in some respects @entity1 is a pragmatist , her dreams for a better and safer world have spawned a passion for political activism			2
last summer , 32 years after @entity1 helped organize a famous " @entity153 " concert , she and her partners in @entity155 ( @entity155 ) -- @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and others -- put together a follow - up benefit to raise awareness about nuclear power concerns			1
" with @entity164 and what 's been going on with the accidents , and the terrorism threats , and the lack of security and solutions for waste storage , the nuclear issue is ... first and foremost on my mind , " she said			0
but that 's far from the only cause on her mind			0
@entity1 's website lists more than 100 nonprofit partners she encourages fans to learn more about , many having to do with music education			1
while she does spread the love for other charities , she is a huge proponent of such education			0
@entity1 noted that learning about music benefits children in several ways			2
" especially girls , but any kids exposed to music programs and arts programs , do much better on their tests			0
they have a better chance of going to college			0
you know , we 're not just automatons learning how to work machines and do engineering and math and science			0
all of that 's great , but you 've got to build a whole person , " she said			0
@entity1 added that she finds it " thrilling " to learn about the roots of music and culture she loves , often with the aid of the @entity210			2
" you get a chance to see field recordings of blues artists that i never even got to meet , and @entity214 as a young man , all these recordings , you can just pretty much get an education without even going to school , even from the middle of -- you know , in the middle of some @entity223 cornfield or in @entity224			0
" to many musicologists , @entity1 is a crucial link in the chain of great blues artists and she 's even in the @entity229			1
she " apprenticed " with @entity230 , @entity232 @entity231 and @entity233 when those storied performers were about the same age she is now			0
@entity1 's said she 's grateful that her elders did n't just teach her about music			1
" they did n't really seem to care whether their fans were 500 people or you know , 50,000 at some festival , " @entity1 recalled			1
" they just seemed pretty cool and copacetic , grateful to be there , had a great sense of humor , and a wry sense of perspective			0
" " i 'm happy to say that at 62 , i think i 've reached that point where stuff does n't bother me as much , and my gratitude level has gone way up , especially having gone through the loss that i 've had , and losing so many of the great artists that i was close to			0
they taught me how to see it with a grain of salt and a lot of humor and perspective			0

@entity1 's " @entity37 " is her first album in seven years
fans are packing concerts and propelling " @entity37 " into @entity36 's @entity266
" i wanted to take that break so i would miss it enough , " @entity1 told @entity0
