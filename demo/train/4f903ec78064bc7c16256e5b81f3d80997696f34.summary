-- what 's worse : racist monkey chants or being one minute late ? the answer appears to be 60 seconds of tardiness , if the fines dished out by @entity6 this week are anything to go by			1
@entity10 football 's governing body caused outrage by fining @entity12 € 30,000 ( $ 40,000 ) for running onto the pitch " less than 60 seconds late " -- which was € 10,000 ( $ 13,000 ) more than @entity16 's punishment for fans ' racist abuse during a match against the @entity21 club			1
now , with just weeks until the @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity26 -- countries with a reputation for neo-nazi groups in the stands -- pressure is mounting on @entity6 to prove it is serious about tackling racism			1
the world will be watching the best teams in @entity34 go head - to - head , but they 'll also be closely monitoring the one million fans expected to fill stadiums across the countries			1
" this fine does nothing to help @entity6 's reputation in relation to how it tackles discrimination in football , " says @entity39 , head of anti-racism group @entity41			2
" we 've seen significant punishments meted out in the past but , as an organization , the line it takes on such matters has lacked consistency			0
" with the @entity24 looming , and the potential flashpoints which may occur during the tournament with right - wing groups in eastern @entity34 , this seems to conflict with the strong anti-racism message @entity6 should be promoting			1
" @entity6 has been accused of double - standards after fining @entity12 50 % more than @entity16 for returning to the field late after the halftime break in a @entity65 match against @entity66 last month			1
the @entity68 club , in comparison , was charged € 20,000 after its fans made monkey chants towards black @entity12 players @entity73 and @entity74 during the previous round at @entity76 do @entity77			1
the decision raises serious questions over @entity6 's commitment to tackling racism in a part of the world still struggling against extremism			2
the ugly cloud of racism hanging over football in @entity25 and @entity26 was highlighted earlier this year in an investigation by campaign group never again			1
its report , called " hateful , " detailed 195 individual incidents of racist and discriminatory behavior in an 18 - month period from september 2009 to march 2011 , a figure that underlines the amount of work that still needs to be done			2
" unfortunately it seems racism is deeply rooted in the culture of soccer , especially in @entity34 , " @entity97 , head of the @entity25 - based organization , told @entity0 last year			2
" of course it 's a broader problem , affecting countries such as @entity105 and @entity106 , but it is a real issue in @entity34			2
" there is goodwill at the top of @entity6 to deal with the issue , but their genuine commitment does not translate to national football federation level and this is where more awareness raising needs to be done , " @entity97 said			2
keeping an eye on the crowd in @entity25 and @entity26 will be members from @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , who 'll be reporting discriminatory behavior back to @entity6			0
@entity118 has called for greater charges for racist fans			0
but executive director @entity123 was also quick to point out the strict rationale behind @entity6 's fines this week -- and the need to better communicate this to the public			0
" @entity6 has a very clear system of sanctions			0
i think the reason for the disparity in fines is this is the fourth time in two seasons that @entity12 have been late to play , " he said			1
" whereas @entity16 have n't been in front of @entity6 in three or four years			1
it 's an important point that has n't come across in the media			0
" @entity0 contacted @entity6 to ask for clarification of the fines , but did not receive an official response			0
the ruling body , however , does have a strong stance against racism , and has worked closely with @entity118 since 2001			0
@entity123 said extremist fans -- known as " ultras " -- are still a major issue in eastern @entity34 and his team will be looking for @entity150 paraphernalia throughout the tournament , which runs from june 8 to july 1			1
however , @entity123 admitted that @entity25 's inclusion in the @entity153 in 2004 had significantly helped it reduce extremism			0
" this is new territory for a major competition to go to a place like @entity25 or @entity26			0
it 's fantastic it 's going to a new place , but it also means there are bigger challenges we face , " he said			0
" our ongoing challenge is to get the message out to countries where @entity170 players , who are n't common , are being abused			0
