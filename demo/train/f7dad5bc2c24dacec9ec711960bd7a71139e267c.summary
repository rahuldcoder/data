-- black voters allowed themselves to be used by sen. @entity2 to win the @entity4 primary runoff for @entity7 's @entity6 seat			1
@entity2 beat state sen. @entity8 by targeting black @entity9 and getting them to vote for him in a tight race			1
it was a brilliant political strategy in a state that allows open primaries , where voters can cross party lines to vote			0
it also showed blacks -- and the @entity4 that ignores them -- that black voters can wield political influence			1
@entity2 won the runoff by a little over 6,000 votes			0
the runoff was triggered because no candidate garnered 50 % of the vote in the first primary , which @entity2 lost to @entity8 by some 1,000 votes			2
but make no mistake , @entity2 appealed to black @entity9 voters out of desperation			1
when was the last time we heard @entity2 reaching out to ask for the black vote in the last six terms he 's served as senator ? @entity2 's campaign suggested @entity8 was a tea party radical			1
the tea party has become code for " racist " among many black @entity39 , who overwhelmingly vote @entity9			0
black @entity9 voters allowed themselves to be exploited by @entity2 's boogeyman -- the @entity37 nonsense -- without looking into the policies and records of each candidate			1
@entity8 was a conservative candidate opposed to illegal immigration , which harms black americans			0
the black unemployment rate has been higher than the national average for the past five years and blacks often compete for the same jobs as undocumented workers			0
refusing to concede the election , @entity8 and other conservatives said @entity2 played dirty politics by reaching out to black @entity9 to win			1
it 's true these same voters will likely vote for the @entity9 nominee in the fall			2
but i suspect @entity8 is just angry he did n't think of the idea first			0
it was distasteful to see conservatives like @entity63 accuse @entity2 of race - baiting because he decided to ask black @entity9 to vote for him			1
how is asking blacks to cast a vote for you race - baiting ? while i do n't agree with how @entity2 won and wish blacks were more informed about their vote , @entity2 bothered to ask blacks to vote for him , something that apparently makes some @entity4 cringe			1
even the @entity73 - dominated @entity72 has now applauded his use of blacks to win			1
many blacks would say the @entity4 only works in earnest for the white vote			0
presidential nominee @entity79 did a good job of winning the majority of the white vote ( 60 % ) in 2012 , but he lost the election because he ignored the minority and woman voters -- that is , he hardly bothered to ask for their votes			0
this @entity7 primary race is a harbinger of what can happen to the @entity4 in future national elections if @entity4 continue to ignore the black vote			2
instead of allowing themselves to vote solely based on misleading headlines and misinformation , blacks need to be voting based upon candidates ' positions on issues and how they affect them			0
come november , i doubt @entity2 will really care about earning the black vote and taking the @entity4 message of equal opportunity and economic empowerment to blacks			2
@entity106 just believed the hype about @entity8 being a racist and did n't dig any deeper			0
@entity2 will run in the general election ignoring black voters , just as the @entity4 has done for the past 40 years			1
this is n't a watershed moment			2
it 's another example of blacks throwing away their political influence -- as they have on the @entity9 since 1964 -- and getting nothing in return			2
@entity2 demonstrates what many black conservatives already know : @entity4 candidates will only reach out to black voters , kicking and screaming , as a last resort to win			1
this is n't the path to future @entity4 victories in truly competitive national races in a country where census data show the white population declining while minorities are growing			0
the big takeaway from the @entity2 win is that @entity4 had better get serious			0
join us on @entity135 / @entity134 .			0
