@entity0 -- a heavy security presence permeated lower @entity3 on sunday , the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , as authorities continued their search for possible plotters of another terrorist strike			1
information considered credible but unconfirmed indicated up to three attackers could be trying to use an explosives - laden vehicle for an attack in @entity0 or @entity15 , according to various sources			1
authorities stressed that while they were taking information of a possible attack plot seriously , there was no evidence so far that an actual terrorist operation was underway			1
" we 're looking into a number of leads , " said @entity23 , the assistant to the @entity25 president for homeland security and counterterrorism , on the @entity29 program " @entity30			2
" " again , it 's not confirmed yet , but we 're not relaxing at all			2
" @entity23 said a security meeting took place sunday morning at the @entity36 to go over all the intelligence			1
a @entity36 spokesman told reporters that no new information came out of the sunday meeting			1
with president @entity42 , former president @entity43 and other dignitaries attending a ceremony at the former @entity47 site , heavily armed police officers and federal security agents -- some wearing body armor -- deployed in the area			1
roads were blocked and police checkpoints for both vehicles and pedestrians surrounded the memorial , with backpacks checked by bomb - sniffing dogs and put through x-ray machines			1
at the ceremony , @entity42 and the first lady stood behind bulletproof protection			2
two of the three individuals believed to be involved in the potential plot on the 9/11 anniversary are @entity25 of @entity68 descent who traveled to the @entity25 last week , according to a @entity25 government official who spoke on condition of not being identified by name			1
authorities have been piecing together clues gleaned from flight logs and manifests , among other sources , to try to trace the whereabouts of the two , said the @entity25 government official			1
a third person is believed to have been traveling through @entity81 , though it is not clear whether that person has arrived in the @entity25 , the government official said			2
however , another law enforcement official said there is no evidence so far that any of the three individuals came to the @entity25 or are here now			1
it is still not apparent whether a plot is under way , officials say , maintaining the same stance they have taken since news of the possible plans for an attack first became public on thursday			1
" it 's still ongoing , " @entity0 police commissioner @entity95 said saturday			1
" nothing significant has changed			2
the threat has been identified as being credible and specific and uncorroborated			2
" @entity25 spy networks had intercepted communications of a potential attack from an @entity104 operative in @entity105 , derived from a source who has provided accurate information in the past , officials say			1
no other corroborating evidence of an attack has been uncovered , but it has prompted intelligence officials to sift through communications from other @entity104 cells			1
@entity25 officials rarely speak on the record about intelligence intercepts			2
in the days following the raid on @entity120 's compound , officials indicated @entity104 had gone to great lengths to avoid having its communications intercepted by the @entity25			2
authorities also say they have picked up " chatter , " or widely divergent communications , from extremists that suggest the newly tapped @entity104 head , @entity128 , is in some way involved in the current plot			1
three stolen trucks were added to a @entity133 database because of the threat , said deputy police commissioner @entity135			1
the database is connected to the @entity133 's digital license plate readers			0
" we 're adding them in the interest of being prudent , " @entity137 told @entity1 , emphasizing there is no known link to the terror threat			0
two of the trucks were owned by a construction company that operates at the @entity147			0
they were reported stolen over a week ago and had about $ 70,000 worth of tools on them , @entity95 noted			0
both vehicles were subsequently recovered , the @entity133 said sunday			1
one was discovered empty , unoccupied and unlocked in a residential area saturday night by uniformed police on routine patrol			1
police said they believe there is no connection between the stolen vehicle and any possible terror plot			1
the second vehicle , a van , was found in @entity161 , said @entity133 lt. @entity162			1
it was unoccupied , he said			0
a budget rental van also was stolen in a separate incident from a @entity167 , @entity168 , storage facility earlier this week , @entity95 told @entity1			0
he said none of the thefts had been tied to any terrorism plot at this point but were being investigated out of an abundance of caution			1
@entity137 said that whoever took the trucks " went to great lengths to cover their tracks -- they cut lines to phones and surveillance cameras			0
" @entity137 also said the city has experienced " a three-fold increase in suspicious package calls , " while suspicious vehicle calls have doubled			1
@entity0 law enforcement officers , meanwhile , have been put on 12 - hour shifts			0
in @entity15 , police chief @entity189 reported that " suspicious activity and suspicious vehicle reporting skyrocketed " over the weekend			1
" i can tell people in this community ( are ) really on it , " said @entity192 , adding that her force had beefed up staffing			0
in neighboring @entity199 , @entity200 , officials located one of two missing u-haul vans , though a police spokesman said authorities " are not viewing this as terrorism - related			1
" cpl. @entity208 said the vans were reported stolen saturday			0
the security posture was evident elsewhere , too			0
a suspicious bag caused the shutdown of a security checkpoint sunday morning at @entity215			0
four hours later , some gates on @entity217 remained closed but flights were operating from other gates , according to airport information officer @entity220			1
he said the incident began when a security guard at a checkpoint grew concerned about something in a man 's carry - on bag			0
the guard asked the man to allow him to search his bag , at which point the man became uncooperative and was detained , @entity227 said			0
because the man had already checked bags , @entity217 was evacuated and closed			0
a bomb squad and other officials located the man 's bags , all of which were opened and inspected			0
no explosives were found , according to @entity242 with the @entity243 in @entity215			0
she declined to provide any details on the man , who is being questioned			0
a @entity248 statement said the security steps were taken " out of an abundance of caution			0
" on saturday , @entity42 met for a second straight day with his senior national security team , according to a @entity36 statement			1
@entity25 vice president @entity254 said friday that information gleaned in part from the may raid against @entity120 in @entity258 , @entity105 , helped reveal the possible new plot			1
it is not clear how the @entity120 raid helped authorities connect the dots to the prospect of an anniversary attack , but @entity254 downplayed the threat of a widely sophisticated plot involving multiple conspirators			1
he told @entity279 's " today " show that the administration 's main concern is a plot from a " lone actor , not some extremely complicated plan like it took to take down the world trade ( center ) towers or the plane in @entity276 ( @entity277 ) or the @entity278			2
" in @entity0 , police officers stopped and searched box trucks , as they approached the @entity282 , which links @entity168 with @entity0 as well as the @entity283 , the @entity284 and the @entity285 , connecting the boroughs of @entity287 and @entity288			2
police also were sweeping parking garages for explosives and using digital license plate readers to check for stolen vehicles , officials said			2
authorities say they are questioning individuals who have previously raised security concerns			2
" we already had a great security plan in place , and in an abundance of caution , we 're deploying more resources , " @entity0 gov. @entity298 told reporters			0
" we should n't allow this threat to diminish the importance of the 9/11 anniversary , because that would be doing just what the terrorists want us to do			0
" in @entity15 , local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since september 1			0
federal officials said they are taking the threat seriously , while trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace in connection with key dates			0
" the @entity243 has been in a planning mode for months with the local and state police officers , as well as the other intelligence agencies , to prepare for this weekend , " said @entity322 , assistant director in charge of the @entity243 's @entity15 field office			2
" what we have here is a little bit more of a public display than we normally have			0
" @entity25 officials believe that the plot could involve operatives who came out of the tribal @entity105 - @entity336 border region -- a volatile semi-lawless area that is home to extremist groups -- and that they are part of @entity104 " central			2
" one official also noted a possibility that @entity105 - based groups such as @entity343 or @entity344 could be involved			0
@entity104 " likely maintained an interest since at least february 2010 in conducting large attacks in the homeland timed to coincide with symbolic dates , to include the 10 - year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , " according to an intelligence bulletin issued thursday			0
@entity120 's death and the " removal " of senior @entity104 figures since then could add to the organization 's desire to stage an attack on a symbolic date such as september 11 , the bulletin said			0
@entity1 's @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 and @entity378 contributed to this report .			0
