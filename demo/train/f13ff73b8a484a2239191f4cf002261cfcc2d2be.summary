-- many have matched his size , some his speed , but no - one ever combined the two to such devastating effect on a rugby field as @entity6			1
the former @entity8 winger became the sport 's first global superstar when he burst onto the international scene at the @entity12 and now , almost two decades on , his appeal shows no sign of slowing down			1
in his capacity as ambassador for the recent @entity18 tournament in @entity19 , @entity6 was given a hero 's welcome at the @entity8 capital 's @entity21			1
it 's a reception he 's got used to wherever he goes , but the cries are particularly heartfelt at a ground where he represented both the provincial side @entity19 and the @entity28 in @entity29 from 2000 - 2003			1
" the greatest thing i love about sevens is the camaraderie that the players have among all the nations			0
but at the same time the fans make what sevens is all about , " @entity6 tells @entity0 's @entity37 show			1
" it 's exactly how the game should be played -- fair play but at the same time speed , skill , pace : everything that needs to be done , " he adds			1
" you see it in the crowd as well -- they need a bit of stamina ( too ) because it 's two days of partying hard			1
there 's a lot of celebrating going on but it 's absolutely beautiful to be a player on the pitch or a former player in the stands watching your favorite team			2
" @entity6 's international career began at the @entity62 in 1994 before gaining his first full cap against @entity64 later that year to become the youngest player ( 19 years , 45 days ) to wear the prestigious @entity8 jersey since the start of that century			1
" when i chucked on my @entity8 shirt , for me , it was like armor , getting ready to go into battle , " he says			1
" when you get the opportunity to pull it on it is absolutely something special			0
" the following year his enormous frame -- 1.96 meters ( 6 foot 5 inches ) tall , weighing 260 pounds ( 117 kg ) -- made a global impact at the @entity78 in @entity79			2
@entity6 famously trampled all over @entity81 's pride ( and @entity83 's body ) in the semifinals , running in four tries -- inducing insult then praise from @entity87 after the game			2
" he 's a freak and the sooner he goes away the better , " the shell - shocked @entity81 captain said following his team 's 45 - 29 defeat			1
" he 's very balanced , has that incredible power and anyone coming on to the ball like he did is almost impossible to stop			2
he 's an amazing athlete			2
" @entity37 's current fastest player , @entity98 @entity97 , who reportedly runs the 100 meters in 10.13 seconds , says speeding down the wing feels like flying			1
but from @entity6 -- who has a best of 10.80 seconds over the same distance -- comes a more earthy assessment			0
" i do n't know what other people are thinking of when they 're running down the sidelines , but all i think about is there is one destination that i need to get to and that 's the try line , " @entity6 says			2
" whoever or whatever is in front of me , i either go around it or over it , or if not create something for my teammates			0
" from 1994 - 2002 , @entity6 ran in a total of 37 tries in 63 appearances for @entity8 in an international career interrupted and eventually prematurely curtailed by a life - threatening kidney condition			1
the 38 - year - old has suffered from nephrotic syndrome , a rare kidney disorder , since 1995			1
he nearly died in 2011 when a transplanted organ received in 2004 started to fail			0
" my bloodstream was septic and the doctors were starting to think the worst : that my kidney had failed and my body was in total meltdown , " @entity6 , who on the waiting list for a new transplant , revealed last year			1
he has been able to deal with his health problems by drawing on his experiences on the rugby field			2
" the reason why i think i can cope with my medical condition ( is because of ) the things that i 've learned through rugby -- the desires and beliefs that i was given through playing the game , " @entity6 says			2
" it 's helped me get through all the adversity that i 've gone through and at the same time prepared me for life			0
that 's the one thing that rugby has -- it gives you opportunities but at the same time gives you the belief that you can get through anything			1
" @entity6 still requires regular dialysis but is n't one to complain , preferring to focus on the positives			0
" medically , i 'm as good as i can be			0
traveling around the world is always difficult because of the medical treatment that i need , but i 've got a great wife ( @entity156 ) who organizes it all			0
the family that i have gives me the will to get up in the morning ... especially my two boys ( @entity162 and @entity163 ) -- that 's always a reason to get up			0
" another incentive has been promoting sevens in @entity19 and around the world as the the abbreviated version of rugby union gears up for its @entity171 debut at @entity172 in 2016			1
" when you 're talking about the changing dimensions of the game , sevens is where it 's at , " he says			0
" the nations that could n't match the bigger nations at the 15 - man game , they can definitely do this and get in there and compete with the best nations ... or even knock them over , as the @entity185 team has shown us			0
" @entity185 -- a relative rugby backwater -- shocked the rugby world by beating @entity8 in the semifinals at last year 's @entity190			1
this time around , the east @entity196 did n't fair so well , but still managed a notable win over @entity198 , the sport 's inventors back in 1883 , in the final of the @entity195 competition last month			0
" the biggest thing for sevens is making sure it grows in the way it should grow and people keep enjoying it , " @entity6 says			0
" but the beauty is that it can only get better			0
" when you 've got 142 countries playing the game , that 's awesome to see			0
and this is the next level			0
