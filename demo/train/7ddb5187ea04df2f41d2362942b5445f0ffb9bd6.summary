-- just 24 months before the showdown in the @entity3 , @entity0 's @entity1 reported this week that possible presidential hopeful @entity4 may have an @entity6 problem -- and may again have difficulties winning the state in the 2016 caucuses -- because of weaknesses among the state 's most progressive voters			1
but that analysis fails to understand and appreciate the country 's changing demographics and where @entity17 politics is heading			1
@entity18 has n't announced whether she 'll run for president again			1
but whether or not she has an @entity6 problem , @entity6 is largely unrepresentative of @entity17 's changing composition			1
it 's 91 % white in a country that 's 64 % white , and it will have a shrinking role in choosing future @entity17 presidents			0
and , even if @entity18 does have an @entity6 problem , she will probably have a @entity30 solution			1
the composition of the @entity32 and @entity33 has now changed to the point where @entity35 have a real chance of winning statewide elections for seats long held by @entity39			1
here are the facts : nine out 10 of @entity6 's 3 million residents are white			1
the state has six electoral votes and 65 delegates			0
in contrast , 63 % of @entity30 's 10 million residents are white			2
they have 16 electoral votes and 124 delegates			0
in 2012 , president @entity50 lost @entity30 by 300,000 votes in a state that has 600,000 eligible , non-voting african - americans			2
and the @entity30 solution begins with @entity55			2
the 47 - year - old daughter of respected of @entity30 sen. @entity57 -- who served for 24 years as one of the state 's leading @entity35 -- is running for @entity60 and is poised to prove that a @entity61 ( and a woman ) can win the @entity30 seat held by a @entity39 for the past decade			1
@entity57 is tied in the polls and has proven to be a formidable fundraiser			0
her campaign paves the way for a @entity18 win in @entity30 because the ground operations and campaign infrastructure she 's built will probably assist @entity18 's efforts in the state			1
as the first woman to hold a @entity60 seat from the @entity30 , she readies the electorate to vote for a female president			2
in a similar way , @entity80 ' gubernatorial bid in @entity81 helps a potential @entity18 campaign			1
@entity81 is another battleground state with significant numbers of voters of color -- who could one day help turn that state from red to purple -- and @entity93 ' statewide win may pave the way to a @entity18 victory in @entity81			1
( pac + has publicly endorsed the candidacies of both @entity57 and @entity93			0
) there is a new majority emerging in @entity17 , and it 's not about @entity6			2
it 's about @entity30 , @entity81 and other states where people of color will make the difference			1
these are states where rapid population growth over the past 10 years has resulted in increased electoral votes			0
@entity109 's population increased nearly 25 % , and it now has 11 electoral college votes -- one more than they had last time around			0
@entity112 's population increased 17 % , and it has nine votes			0
@entity114 gained two electoral votes for a total of 29 , based on a nearly 18 % population increase			0
@entity118 gained one electoral vote , bringing its total to six to reflect a whopping 35 % population increase in 10 years			0
it 's a trend that experts expect to continue , and these are all states with large and growing populations of people of color			0
in @entity30 -- whose primary has usually been held well after @entity6 's caucuses -- a changing political landscape is not the exception , it 's the rule			1
democrats must look forward and invest in the coalition of the future			0
they must meaningfully connect with communities of color and progressive whites and champion policies that address inequality and immigration and education			0
that way , as the @entity6 caucuses continue to recede in significance , the democrats still can win for years to come			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			0

@entity149 : questions about @entity4 in @entity6 are n't as *bad* as they sound
she argues that changing demographics in @entity30 and @entity81 may help @entity18
@entity149 says two women running for top offices in the @entity32 could help @entity18
