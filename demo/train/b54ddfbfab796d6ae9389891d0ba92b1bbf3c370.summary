@entity18 's goal that never was as @entity19 trailed 2 - 1 just before halftime in their last 16 match against @entity22 , prompted widespread calls for the introduction of goal - line technology after his shot clearly crossed the line			1

" the only principle we are going to bring back for discussion is goal - line technology , " he said time for football to embrace technology ? " football is a game that never stops and the moment there was a discussion if the ball was in or out , or there was a goal - scoring opportunity , do we give a possibility to a team to call for replays once or twice like in tennis ? " for situations like the @entity32 game you do n't need technology			1
