a backlash from @entity1 over add - ons to a massive government spending bill is throwing passage of the measure into doubt and once again raising concerns about a government shutdown			1
the @entity10 is slated to vote on the legislation thursday , just hours before agencies run out of money			1
but on the morning of the scheduled vote , rep. @entity13 , a member of @entity15 leadership , said the riders in bill have become a " poison pill " against @entity15 support that the @entity22 majority needs for the measure to pass			1
" at this point i do n't see many @entity15 votes at all for a bill that is so antithetical to the middle class , " @entity23 told @entity24 following a meeting with other @entity15 leaders			2
the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill authorizes funding for virtually all agencies through september , but some @entity1 on @entity34 are vowing to oppose the legislation , arguing that the addition of some key policy changes amount to a giveaway for big special interests			1
@entity41 must pass some type of legislation by thursday at midnight to avert a shutdown			1
the top concerns from @entity1 center on a proposal to ease banking regulations in the @entity50 law and a measure that would allow wealthy donors to give considerably more money to the political parties			0
@entity10 minority leader @entity55 said the provisions were " destructive to middle class families and to the practice to our democracy " and demanded they be stripped out of the bill			2
@entity55 's position is critical because @entity10 @entity22 need @entity15 support for the measure to pass			2
though @entity22 hold a significant majority in the @entity10 , speaker @entity64 is expected to lose anywhere from 40 to 60 conservatives in his party who oppose the bill because it does n't block the president 's immigration executive action			2
democrats will need to provide votes to offset those losses , setting up the sort of political brinksmanship that has become typical in @entity77			0
a shutdown remains unlikely because lawmakers could agree at the last minute to approve a bill that would keep the government running for a few months -- when @entity22 will have full control of @entity41			1
@entity10 @entity22 aides say they are surprised @entity55 and others are lobbying for changes , since @entity1 signed off on the bill before its release			2
@entity10 majority leader @entity88 , asked by @entity24 if he was concerned about the bill 's prospects , said no , replying with a smile , " do i look worried ? " @entity1 are also blasting the deal			1
sen. @entity93 of @entity94 , the second ranking @entity1 who is in charge of counting votes , said he did n't know if he would support the compromise or how many @entity1 would			0
he called the @entity50 provisions " awful			0
" " it is just an invitation for another financial disaster and the @entity22 are hell - bent on getting that included , " @entity93 told reporters in the @entity34			0
" their appetite is whetted by the nov. 4th election to undo @entity50			0
that has been one of their passions , second only to repealing the @entity111 , and it means that the @entity114 interests -- the big banks , you know -- they 're back on top as far as the @entity10 @entity22 are concerned , " he said			0
sen. @entity118 , the @entity119 from @entity120 who is heavily involved in banking regulations , lashed out at the changes to the banking rules			0
" @entity10 is about to vote on a budget deal -- a deal negotiated behind closed doors that slips in a provision that would let derivatives traders on @entity114 gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system , " she said in a passionate floor speech			1
" these are the same banks that nearly broke the economy in 2008 and destroyed millions of jobs			0
" she urged @entity1 to oppose the spending bill until " this risky giveaway is removed from the legislation			1
" on the campaign finance matter , house speaker @entity64 said larger individual donations to the parties are needed because @entity41 had recently eliminated taxpayer funds for political conventions			1
" the @entity41 is very concerned about taxpayer funding of political activities , " @entity64 said			1
" this provision was worked out in a bipartisan way to allow those who are organizing conventions the opportunity to raise the money from private sources as opposed to using taxpayer funds			0
" @entity22 aides familiar with the negotiations say that both the chairs of the @entity159 and @entity160 supported the change on contributions limits to boost their own coffers			0
but @entity160 chair @entity164 told @entity24 it was " absolutely not " true that she knew anything about the change to campaign finance laws being added to the spending bill			1
she said there was a joint effort with the @entity159 to appeal to the @entity171 to raise the cap for donors for conventions , but she did not support putting this provision in the funding bill			2
@entity15 aides say it 's still early to gauge how many members will vote no on thursday , but acknowledge that the deal was brokered by @entity1 and @entity22 over several weeks			1
@entity1 who negotiated the deal defended the end result , saying republicans had pressed for six different changes to @entity50 but @entity1 were able to whittle it down to one			0
@entity1 also said they successfully removed more than two dozen environmental items and a handful of gun - related policy provisions sought by @entity22			0
@entity191 rep. @entity190 , a top @entity55 deputy , said he 's voting no , and described the opposition as " running deep and getting deeper " as more democrats review the details			0
the number three @entity10 @entity119 , @entity197 rep. @entity196 , told reporters he was undecided , but was hearing " lots of concerns " about the banking provision , and said " a lot of civil rights groups have been burning up the airwaves with problems about this			0
" a similar measure removing this same financial regulation was passed by the @entity10 last october , with 70 democrats voting for it , a point @entity88 noted on wednesday when pressed about the latest criticism from democrats " do they want to shut down the government ? " @entity88 said about those democrats vowing to oppose the spending measure			1
@entity64 's spokesman said the controversial provisions will remain in the bill			0
" if rep. @entity55 does n't think her negotiators did a good job , she should discuss it with them - but sour grapes does n't mean she gets to rewrite the deal after the fact , " @entity219 said in a statement to @entity24			2
still @entity22 insist that there wo n't be a shutdown over this issue , and indicated they would consider a short - term funding bill through early next year -- when they will have full control of @entity41 -- if this bill fails .			1
