the opening was so small that @entity2 's @entity1 -- no physical giant -- had to bend down to climb inside one of 30 or so @entity6 tunnels from @entity7 to southern @entity8			1
" i guess the tunnel was built for relatively short people , because if you stand up you 're going to hit your head , " @entity1 said of the almost two - mile concrete corridor about 45 feet underground where he reported from monday			2
his visit , accompanied by the @entity8 military , revealed conditions in the network of tunnels below @entity7 that are a key issue in the current violent spasm between @entity22 militants in @entity7 and @entity8			1
originally built to avoid @entity8 and @entity25 checkpoints into @entity7 , the tunnels have been vital supply lines for @entity6 in @entity7			1
now the snaking underground routes increasingly get used for attacks in @entity8			0
@entity8 prime minister @entity29 launched a ground assault on @entity7 this month intended to destroy the tunnel network , and @entity1 went into one of them so see what it was like			1
cooler than the surface so far down , the tunnel was surprisingly cool inside compared to the hot conditions on the surface , @entity1 noted			0
stooped over , he walked along the concrete - encased pathway with wiring visible in some parts			0
the concrete came from @entity8 , as did the electric power @entity6 send down for lights in some parts , said lt. col. @entity46 , deputy commander of @entity8 's @entity47			2
it took two years or more , progressing a meter or two a day , to extend the tunnel into @entity8 , according to @entity46			0
" it 's pretty secure , this concrete , " @entity1 said			0
" they spent a lot of effort building this tunnel			0
" the tunnel ended near a kibbutz in @entity8 , @entity46 said , adding its purpose was to attack people on the collective agriculture community			0
used for attacks later monday , the @entity6 representative to the @entity62 told @entity1 the tunnels originated to get around the blockade of @entity7 , but take on another role in conflict			1
" factions in @entity7 are utilizing them to target the @entity8 military , especially at times of conflict , " @entity67 said , adding : " they want to be creative about how to respond to any attacks			2
and probably also take initiative			0
" a series of @entity22 attacks via tunnels on @entity8 soil escalated @entity8 's response in the current violence			1
the method of attack , in which militants spring out unexpectedly from underground , has raised fears among @entity8 living near @entity7			2
" they are a strategic danger , " @entity8 government spokesman @entity88 said of the tunnels later monday , telling @entity1 it was " unacceptable " to have @entity22 attackers " just pop out of the ground on our side of the frontier to murder and kidnap			1
" however , @entity6 parliament member @entity96 called the tunnels a defensive tactic against repeated @entity8 invasions in recent years			1
" these tunnels are nothing but a primitive way of trying to defend themselves , " he told blitzer			0
' @entity7 ' @entity8 military officials refer to the tunnels as " @entity7			2
" they are n't new			0
@entity22 used one in 2006 to capture @entity8 soldier @entity108 and take him into @entity7			1
he was held captive for five years until a deal was struck for his release in exchange for more than 1,000 @entity6 prisoners			0
during its incursion into @entity7 , @entity8 's military has so far found scores of different access shafts leading to about 30 tunnels			1
it says it destroyed about half , but expects to find more			0
@entity1 said @entity8 wants to remove the tunnels from the equation before agreeing to a cease - fire with @entity22 .			1

tunnels unacceptable to @entity8 ; a defense tactic to @entity6
