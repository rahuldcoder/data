-- " i did n't become a nurse to risk dying -- by getting infected from a patient -- and then going home and infecting my children , too ! " the nurse told me			2
she was angry and afraid			0
a new infectious disease was rapidly spreading with no treatment and no end in sight , terrifying doctors , nurses and the public at large			0
as a medical student , i remember being afraid to touch patients with this deadly disease , anxious i might catch it			0
my instructors told me just to swipe my hands and stethoscope with a tiny alcohol wipe and not stick myself with a needle after drawing blood			0
many doctors announced that they would not work in certain hospitals where they felt the disease was more likely			0
the year was 1984 , and the disease was @entity26			1
survey showed that half of medical interns and residents would not continue to treat patients with this disease , if given a choice			0
over the past few weeks , i have thought back to that era , as fears of @entity36 grip the nation			1
for about 15 years -- from its first identification in 1981 until demonstration of its effective treatment , using the so - called " cocktail " in 1997 -- fears of @entity26 swept the world			1
@entity36 and @entity26 are both transmitted through bodily fluids , and potentially fatal			1
@entity36 is far more contagious to caregivers -- mere exposure to bodily fluids such as saliva can spread it			1
our responses to the epidemic of @entity26 have several lessons to teach us			2
with @entity36 , we have not yet seen large numbers of health care professionals announcing that they do not want to come to work because of the possible risks to themselves			1
certainly , some may not want to report to duty to the @entity61 hospital where exposures have occurred , but the vast majority of health care professionals continue to be prepared to treat patients in emergency rooms and elsewhere across the country			1
several doctors and nurses are now getting infected as well -- most recently dr. @entity69 from my institution -- @entity72			0
it is a scary time to be a doctor or nurse			1
medicine has always depended on providers putting themselves at some risk			0
we aim to minimize these dangers , but they often persist			0
until recently , a clear social contract existed concerning medical professionals			2
doctors and nurses agreed to put themselves at danger to help their patients because they operated not just from an economic model of a job description , but from a more profound moral sense of commitment to beneficence -- to the health and well - being of their patients			2
they accepted that sometimes they would have to put their patients ' needs ahead of their own			0
such commitment aids patients and society and instills trust			0
but that professionalism is diminishing as caring for patients evolves from a " calling " to merely a " job			0
" in the end , countless health professionals and i overcame our fear and treated patients with @entity26			1
one surgeon announced , " any staff member who does not want to treat these patients should simply plan to no longer come to work " -- i.e. , to quit			0
yet in all the attention given to the current @entity36 crisis , little has been said about the extraordinary heroism of @entity121 -- an organization better known by its @entity124 name , @entity121 -- and other health care professionals putting themselves on the front lines			1
this organization in particular has emerged as for its inspiring heroism			1
in march , @entity121 started responding to this @entity36 outbreak , and by june it declared the epidemic was " out of control " and that the organization had reached the limit of what it can do alone , calling on the world to provide more aid			1
only in august did the @entity137 issue its first news release about this outbreak			0
still , @entity121 continued to work hard on the front lines in @entity140 , instituting and following procedures for protecting providers that far exceeded those of the vastly better - resourced @entity144 and have only belatedly become the gold standard			1
why ? because they worked hard to uphold their professional ideals			2
their moral commitment has motivated them to respond to crises and develop expertise in delivering on - the - ground care in emergencies			2
@entity121 understands that adequate resources must be marshaled to deal with potential outbreaks			2
but in the @entity144 , we have underfunded governmental health care agencies involved in disease prevention and disaster preparedness at all levels			1
many legislators have argued for less government involvement in our lives and less public health infrastructure			2
but in a crisis , our nation demands that the @entity137 and state and local @entity169 protect us while struggling with increasingly limited budgets			2
the @entity36 crisis has revealed serious gaps in our health care system , and we need to think broadly how to deal more effectively with future epidemics			1
we should also acknowledge the need to support professionals on the front lines of health care delivery			1
their courage in facing this disease should inspire us , since in recent years , notions of medical professionalism have been under siege as profit motives and economic bottom lines drive our health care system			1
insurance companies , health systems and others pressure physicians and nurses to see themselves as employees who punch time clocks and service clients rather than as professionals who care for patients			1
consequently , health providers demonstrate more burnout , as they have had their ideals eroded			0
those who are fully committed -- and there are still many -- have our appreciation			0
historically , doctors and nurses have rallied to care for our sickest patients , sometimes placing themselves at significant risk			0
in the upcoming months , these professionals will be among our greatest weapons against this modern plague .			0

@entity211 : as fear of @entity36 grips the nation , i think back on how @entity26 scared the world
@entity211 : it is a scary time to be a doctor or nurse ; health professional are at the front lines
he says @entity121 , in particular , has emerged for its inspiring heroism
@entity211 : despite eroding morals in health care , we still have many dedicated professionals
