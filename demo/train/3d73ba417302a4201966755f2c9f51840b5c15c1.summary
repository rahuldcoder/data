-- many of @entity3 's leading tech entrepreneurs are meeting at the annual @entity5 conference in @entity6 this week to celebrate the future - an " internet of things " governed by intelligent devices			0
but , rather than @entity6 , the most consequential @entity3 meeting about the future of the @entity7 this week may have taken place in @entity12 on monday			1
in contrast with the radically transparent networking culture that characterizes @entity5 , the @entity12 event was a meeting between two powerful bureaucrats that took place , like all meetings between powerful bureaucrats , behind closed doors			2
@entity22 , the chairman of the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) met with @entity24 , the vice-president of the @entity25 to discuss @entity26 - the dominant company on today 's @entity7			1
specifically , they were meeting to discuss potential @entity23 and @entity29 anti-trust lawsuits against the tech giant , in an attempt to resolve the @entity26 problem			1
it 's a very simple problem			0
the future may , indeed , have arrived on the @entity7			0
but rather than being run by intelligent devices , it 's unfortunately being run more and more by a single company -- @entity26 , which controls over 90 % of the search market in several @entity3 countries			1
and the problem , as both the @entity23 and the commission recognize , is that this dominance may , in part , be illegal			1
@entity26 has been accused in both @entity3 and the @entity44 of using its dominant position in search to unfairly promote its own products and services -- from travel and shopping comparison engines to advertising and mapping			1
these accusations have been well documented and extend from successful @entity44 internet companies such as @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 to @entity3 start - ups like @entity59 and @entity60			2
at a press conference in @entity12 on wednesday , @entity24 confirmed that the commission was working " intensively " on its probe of @entity26			1
meanwhile , @entity26 's executive chairman @entity65 , in a characteristically pugnacious message to @entity24 and @entity22 , told the @entity66 that " it 's time for them to sort of move to one resolution or another			2
it 's not like they do n't have a million documents and so forth			0
given the speed of technological change , it 's time for both the commission and the @entity23 to decide whether or not to bring their anti-trust lawsuits against @entity26			1
the longer both @entity24 and @entity22 wait , the more powerful @entity26 becomes , and the more indecisive and laggardly the regulators appear			2
time is , indeed , of the essence			0
as the future arrives on all our devices and " the internet of things " becomes a reality , it is essential that this @entity26 problem , which is undermining entrepreneurial innovation , is resolved			1
an internet of things must be a place of all of our things , not just @entity26 's things			0
and as @entity26 products such as its self - driving cars and data goggles pioneer this brave new world of intelligent devices , it is essential that the @entity23 and the commission guarantee that the ubiquitous @entity26 search engine does n't degenerate into a platform for this increasingly powerful company to hawk its own intelligent products and services			2
@entity26 's @entity65 spoke at @entity107 last year			0
" this particular conference is one of the best venues for new entrepreneurs in @entity3 , " he said , rightly , of @entity3 's largest internet event			0
but for future entrepreneurs really to be able to innovate , we need fair search which does n't prioritize the products and services of @entity26 itself			2
we are thus relying on @entity22 and @entity24			0
let 's hope they can make a decision on whether to move ahead with their anti-trust cases by the end of the year			0
let 's hope they can solve the @entity26 problem			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity129 .			0

@entity44 and @entity29 regulators met in @entity12 this week to discuss " the @entity26 problem "
they were considering whether its dominance of the search market may be illegal
@entity129 says they need to decide soon whether to *pursue* anti-trust lawsuits
he says it is *important* to ensure entrepreneurial innovation is allowed to *flourish*
