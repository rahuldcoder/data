good or bad , @entity0 usually thrives on reviews -- but when antitrust officials in @entity4 gave their damning opinion of the travel website , it was n't quite so happy			1
slapped with a 500,000 euro fine ( $ 611,000 ) for unfair trade activity and " misleading consumers , " @entity0 has hit back , accusing the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) of being out of touch			1
" we think the ruling is unreasonable , strongly disagree with its findings and will file an appeal , " it said in a statement			0
" we firmly believe that @entity0 is a force for good -- both for consumers and the hospitality industry			0
" the regulator complained that people reading @entity23 were unable to distinguish between genuine and fake reviews posted on the site			1

" demanding payment of the fine within 30 days , the @entity9 also accused the travel company of failing to provide proper checks to weed out bogus postings			2
it said @entity23 had fallen foul of three articles of the @entity4 consumer code , " making it likely to mislead a wide audience of consumers			1
" ' zero tolerance ' in its response , @entity0 said it took aggressive action to fight fraud and had adequate systems in place to prevent it			0
it complained that the @entity4 watchdog 's " zero tolerance " rules meant it would be liable to the same punishment even if just one review out of millions was deemed questionable			2
" from our initial review we believe that the @entity9 's recommendations are unwarranted and out of touch with commercial realities , not just of a user - generated content business , but of any company in any sector , " it said			1
