-- @entity1 says she will keep fighting to win a place on the @entity5 grid -- but she wo n't rely on her sexuality to get there			1
@entity1 took a big step forward as she spent a full day testing a @entity10 car at @entity11			1
it was the first meaningful running by a female driver in 20 years			1
" some say i seem very reluctant to play the female card but ultimately a race team is only going to put the best driver they can in a race car , " said @entity1			1
" it was important to show that i have the performance			0
" i 'm not going to say ' give me the [ seat ] right now because i 'm a girl and i was fast enough			0
' i 've got to keep fighting hard			0
" the 30 - year - old @entity22 , who started karting at the age of eight , completed 89 laps of the challenging @entity26 @entity25			1
@entity1 was the ninth fastest of 16 drivers running at @entity11 friday			2
her best lap of one minute 35.093 seconds was 2.199 seconds slower than the fastest time set over the three - day test by @entity31 's world champion @entity30			1
it is difficult to read into testing but to put @entity1 's time into context the leading @entity10 car was also just over two seconds slower than @entity30 during qualifying at the last race in @entity38			1
@entity1 was watched late on in the test by her husband @entity40 , who is a minority shareholder in the @entity10 team and director of the @entity45 team			1
experienced @entity47 driver @entity46 , who was on track at the same time as @entity1 , praised her impressive full track debut			2
" she was pretty quick , " said the @entity50			0
" i was very happy for her when i saw her lap times			0
" it would be good for a team to push @entity1 in driving at the races and it would be very interesting for everybody to have her in @entity5			2
" @entity1 , who ended her career in the @entity38 @entity59 [ @entity60 ) to join the @entity10 team as a development driver in 2012 , said her main aim was to earn the right to drive again for the team , not to earn acceptance in the male - dominated sport			1
" for me it 's not about getting praise , it 's not about caring what the other drivers think , " she said			0
" it 's most important that the team are happy because if they 're happy i 'm going to get more chances			2
" many people said they were crazy and why would they waste a day on me but they took that chance and i was happy that i could do a good job			0
" i would n't be doing this if i did n't think this was possible and i believe in myself			0
" after a tough end to my @entity60 career many people assumed i was always at the back and just was n't quick enough but i have showed that was possibly an unfair judgment			0
" @entity5 experts at @entity11 were impressed with @entity1 's debut and were pleased to see a positive performance by a female racer			1
@entity91 @entity90 , who was signed as a development driver by the @entity94 team in 2012 , lost her right eye in an accident on her first run in the team 's race car			2
of the five women to join @entity5 before @entity1 and @entity102 , only two have ever qualified to start a race			2
the most prolific of these was @entity105 @entity104 , who started 12 grands prix in the 1970s			0
@entity104 made history while driving with march at the @entity108 , becoming the only woman to register a point - scoring finish in a grand prix			0
tire test the @entity11 test doubled up as an opportunity to evaluate new drivers and for many of the regular race drivers to trial the new @entity120 tires which will be introduced at the next grand prix in @entity122			1
@entity10 's sole tire supplier had been under pressure to find a safer solution after a series of tire blowouts wreaked havoc during june 's @entity26 round of the world championship			2
the new tires blend 2012 's more solid construction with this season 's softer compounds and , after three days of testing , both @entity120 and the drivers believe a safe compromise has been found			1
" the consistency and safety of the tires is better , " said @entity46			0
" nothing has happened here in terms of the punctures that we have seen and that is the most important thing			0
" @entity30 added : " we have had three days with different drivers in different cars and no failures			0
" pirelli expect the new tires will provide an " interesting mix of race strategies " although many of the drivers at the @entity11 test are predicting the new rubber will mean fewer pit - stops are made during the race .			1

@entity1 makes full @entity5 debut for @entity10 team at @entity11 test
the 30 - year - old is the first female to take part in a meaningful run in an @entity10 car in more than 20 years
@entity1 was three seconds off the pace of @entity30 's leading lap time for @entity31
drivers happy new @entity120 tires tested at @entity11 are safe
