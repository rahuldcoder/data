-- no , there may not be an @entity2 season this year			1
but there is another installment of " @entity5 , " the top - rated basketball video game for 11 years running			1
this year 's version , " @entity7 , " will let you end the debate about what historical team is the greatest by offering 15 classic teams and players to battle on the court			2
the enhancements to the @entity19 , which allows you to create your own player and guide his career through the @entity2 draft , his rookie season and beyond , are what really make this an engaging game			1
like in previous versions of the game , you start off by creating your player 's physical attributes ( height , weight , age , etc. )			1
the game then assigns your abilities based off what type of player you want to be ( perimeter shooter , post player , etc. )			1
in theory , you could create a 7 - foot point guard with zero post abilities , but i 'm guessing the high dribble would make you susceptible to steals			1
after finalizing your player , you immediately play in a rookie showcase game that helps determine where you are selected in the " @entity46			1
this game shows off " @entity7 's " improvements over previous versions in replicating players ' movements and facial features			2
the game 's announcers also do a good job of mixing your player 's performance into their play - by - play chatter			1
in the game , you try to play flawlessly while improving your teammate grade by making good passes , playing transition defense and demonstrating other skills that lead to victory			2
meeting these goals help increase your skill point totals , which translate into improved attributes			0
i created a 6 - foot - 6 shooting guard from @entity70 ( my alma mater ) and picked up 18 points and a b - minus on my teammate grade in the rookie game			2
after the game , your player has to answer two questions from teams that will be interested in drafting him			2
how you answer is taken into consideration prior to the draft			2
the @entity82 ( no. 9 pick ) , @entity84 ( no. 11 ) and @entity85 ( no. 12 ) were interested in my shooting guard			0
i answered the questions in a way that i hoped would get me selected by each team , but there was an answer choice , " i do not want to play for your team , " that would have automatically dropped me off that team 's list			0
then it 's time for the draft			2
just like in real life , the draft starts off with @entity2 commissioner @entity98 ( yes , it was really his voice ) announcing the first pick and continuing on until your player gets selected			1
if you do n't get picked early , this can be a rather drawn - out process since there is no way to skip to your selection			0
( developers say the highest any created player can be selected is no. 3 ( @entity85 ) , so do n't set your sights on being the top pick			1
) after walking to the podium and signing your rookie contract , your team 's public relations department contacts you and shows you a new billboard touting you as the future of the franchise			0
having been selected by the @entity82 , it was pretty cool to see my player on some outdoor advertising in @entity82			0
now it 's time to earn that contract			0
your player 's skills can be improved through buying skill points with your contract money or by doing individual and team drills -- most of which are new to this game			1
my shooting guard took advantage of the new arsenal of moves in " @entity135 " to put up 33 points in 16 minutes in his first game			1
( oh , you did n't think your rookie was going to be in the starting lineup , did you ? ) after every game , there is a press conference where you are asked about the game action			0
your answers impact what your teammates think of you , your league - wide reputation and how you are perceived by your hometown fans			0
the answers were tough to interpret , and i came off as a jerk sometimes when i was trying to praise my teammates			0
one flaw with this game : my player still looked awkward when he was speaking			2
his bottom lip did n't seem to move , making him appear frightening when he addressed the media			0
as your season progresses , you can earn more playing time and more endorsements depending on your skills and reputation			0
( those press conference answers are important			0
) later in your career , you can request trades , negotiate contracts and guide your player to the @entity167			1
how long that takes depends on how fast your avatar becomes one of the best players in the league			0
thanks to this @entity19 , " @entity135 " has the depth and versatility to challenge even the best gamer to achieve basketball immortality			1
this improved feature personalizes pro hoops in a way that will have you cheering your player on -- maybe even to greatness .			0
