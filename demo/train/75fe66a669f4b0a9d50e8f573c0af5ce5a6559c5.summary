-- @entity1 is poor , corrupt and rural			1
a team of young documentary makers is hoping to burst the myth of @entity1 as a dangerous backwater by shining a light on some inspiring projects taking place on the continent			1
when filmmaker @entity10 hit the streets of @entity12 to ask passersby : " what do you know about @entity1 ? " the overwhelming response was " not a lot			1
" " it 's very big , very hot			2
most of @entity1 's impoverished			1
i 'm pretty ignorant to @entity1 , " admitted one man			1
" i know about some human rights violations , some wars and genocides , " was the bleak answer from another woman			2
it was a dismal reflection of many @entity28 stereotypes surrounding @entity1 -- one that @entity29 is determined to change			1
watch : fighting @entity31 stereotypes my @entity1 is : hopeful the 27 - year - old hopes to launch an eight - part documentary series ' my @entity1 is ' -- showcasing the continent through the eyes of its insiders			1
" the four things that come to mind when people think of @entity1 are population , problems , poverty , and promise unfulfilled -- headline media reports on the continent			1
but that 's not the whole story , " @entity29 , originally from @entity47 and now living in @entity48 , said			1
the ambitious project would cover 13 cities across @entity1			1
organizers are trying to crowdsource funds through the @entity56 website and hope to start filming in october if they reach their target			0
" between the 1980s and now the image of famine and wars has been ingrained in people 's minds			1
that 's a narrative that 's going to be hard to shift , " @entity63 said			2
" that 's not to discount the fact that this stuff does happen			2
but what i was n't seeing was the solutions			0

this is @entity1 's most populous country and its leading oil producer			1
yet few in the country have benefited from the oil boom with more than half the population still living in poverty			0

put simply , when it comes to @entity47 , the headlines are n't great			2
getting on the @entity104 but according to @entity106 , that 's only half the story			1
" @entity47 is going through a turbulent time , " she admitted			2
" but there 's a rising youth who are trying to educate each other			0
" indeed the trailer for the first @entity115 is show , the focus is on @entity104 -- a @entity47 photography collective " on a mission to show the giant of @entity1 through the lens			1
" launched in 2009 , their powerful images paint a very different image of @entity1			2
it 's a well - rounded collection that captures the frivolity of everyday life , such as market scenes and football matches			0
but does n't shy away from some of the more familiar and gruesome notions of @entity47 such as terrorist attacks and military clampdowns			2
the ' other ' @entity47 @entity104 co-founder @entity133 says her mission is to " conquer sports photography as a northern @entity47 female " -- a bold statement for a " very conservative " country			1
but the gung - ho 33 - year - old appears undeterred as she takes ' @entity140 ' to a @entity47 vs @entity142 football match in the capital @entity76			2
traditional dancers and hip - hop singers entertain the crowds during half - time , while ecstatic fans hug each other with each goal			0
it 's an image of @entity47 that could n't be further from the grim headlines			1
@entity133 admitted that if you believed the @entity28 media , you would n't step foot inside @entity1			2
" they see us as a continent without hope , " the mother - of - three said			0
" for @entity160 , we see hope on the street everyday			0
but on the news you do n't see that			0
it 's always about the negative stuff			0
" instead , what we see is a lot of poor children dying from malaria or polio			0
if you listened to the news everyday you 'd have no hope from the bombings or corruption			0
do n't get me wrong , it is happening			0
but it 's not a constant			0
it 's not the @entity47 we in @entity182 or @entity76 are living in			1
" see also : @entity72 's underground youth culture the 33 - year - old said the country had come a long way since she was growing up under a military regime in the northern state of @entity189			0
@entity133 remained optimistic about democratic change in the west @entity72 country , particularly for women , but was also realistic about its pace			0
" there 's a lot of opportunity and hope as to where we can be , " she said			0
