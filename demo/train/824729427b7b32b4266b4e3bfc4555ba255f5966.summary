-- children should not die in schools			2
children should not die from eating common foods			0
a minuscule speck of a peanut , not even visible , should not take a young child 's life in minutes			1
and yet this has happened in the past two years -- to 13 - year - old @entity10 in @entity11 and to 7 - year - old @entity12 in @entity13			2
as the holidays approach and celebratory treats are brought into schools from home , we must ensure children with food allergies are safe			1
@entity21 can contribute to that by rapidly passing the @entity23 to @entity24			0
this bill would provide states with incentives to require elementary schools and secondary schools to maintain , and permit school personnel to administer , epinephrine -- a form of adrenaline that eases hives and breathing difficulties and when injected , prevents rapid death			1
quite reasonably , many people are a bit suspicious of the new hypersensitivity about foods , wondering if a little hysteria surrounds the issue			0
most adults -- including me -- grew up in a world where @entity46 was a staple			0
i do n't remember having a single friend whose food was restricted for fear of a reaction that could take his or her life			2
unfortunately , and for reasons no one fully understands , food allergies have indeed become more common and more severe			2
in 2010 , i was part of a group of researchers at @entity59 who surveyed a demographically representative sample of 40,000 @entity62 families			0
in a peer - reviewed study published in @entity65 in june 2011 , we revealed our findings : one in 13 children in the @entity62 has a food allergy , and 40 % of those have had a potentially life - threatening reaction such as difficulty breathing and throat constriction			1
to put that in perspective , that means two children in every school classroom , or almost 6 million @entity62 kids , have a food allergy that could potentially endanger their lives			1
and yet food is a part of almost everything children do			0
in school , they eat breakfast , lunch , snacks , treats			1
they eat special items for birthdays , holidays , and random celebrations			0
even if every mother and father tries to be especially careful about what they send to school , no one can predict when a child with a food allergy will accidentally have a reaction to something			1
fortunately , a simple and affordable solution can save lives and relieve at least some of the stress and anxiety about children 's well - being			2
in 2011 , the @entity110 put into place the @entity112 to @entity24			0
all 681 @entity11 public schools , collectively educating more than 400,000 children , have an epinephrine auto - injector to quickly administer the medicine needed to help save a child 's life in a severe allergy attack			1
school nurses and staff know exactly how to respond in a food allergy emergency			1
@entity21 has an opportunity to pass a similar bill before it ends its session			0
sen. @entity126 introduced the @entity23 to @entity24 on november 17 , 2011			0
it can and should be passed			0
why should the nation invest in preventing allergic reactions to foods in particular ? many other equally urgent health issues -- asthma and obesity -- afflict schoolchildren			2
and , quite rightly , public health experts and school nurses are working on those health problems as well			0
but no one wants a child to die in minutes simply because she ate a cupcake at her friend 's school birthday party that was supposedly nut - free -- but had been packaged or made on a counter where nuts had been used			1
this bill will help schools have epinephrine auto - injectors on hand and trained staff for those emergencies			1
that could save the lives of those two children in each @entity62 classroom who are at risk			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			1

@entity157 : exposure to a peanut speck can kill an allergic schoolchild in minutes
this time of year , holiday snacks brought in from home carry allergy risks , she says
@entity157 : easy to save a life if schools have epinephrine on hand and can administer it
school access to @entity175 *crucial* , she says , as allergies *increase*
