the album 's distribution " devalued their music completely , " @entity1 told the @entity15			1
it " sends a huge mixed message to bands ... that are just struggling to get by			2
i think that they were thinking it 's super generous of them to do something like that			2
" the @entity4 album was automatically downloaded into more than 500 million @entity14 folders upon release september 9 -- pleasing some fans but angering others who did n't want the album in the first place			1
@entity37 later apologized for the inconvenience			0
" i 'm sorry about that , " @entity37 said in a question - and - answer video posted this week on the band 's facebook page			0
" i had this beautiful idea , but ( we ) got carried away with ourselves			0
artists are prone to that kind of thing			0
a drop of megalomania , a touch of generosity , a dash of self - promotion and deep fear that these songs , that we poured our life into over the last few years , might n't be heard			0
" @entity37 apologizes for free @entity14 album @entity59 observed that the album had been fully downloaded 26 million times and that 81 million people had listened to at least one song			1
@entity1 also defended the @entity65 ' choice not to put their last two albums on @entity67			1

( @entity70 's @entity69 has made the same point about @entity72			0
) " my whole thing about music is : if somebody 's making money then the artist should be getting a fair cut of it , " @entity1 said			1
presumably referring to @entity67 co-founder @entity80 , he added , " the owner of @entity67 is worth something like 3 billion dollars ... he 's richer than @entity83 and he 's 30 and he 's never written a song			2
" @entity0 's @entity85 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 is *unhappy* that @entity4 gave away " @entity12 " for free
