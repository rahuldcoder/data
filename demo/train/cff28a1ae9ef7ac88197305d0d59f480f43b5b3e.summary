-- pretty soon you 'll be able to print your @entity3 projects at the local @entity4			1
a new service called " @entity6 " will allow customers to upload their designs to @entity4 ' website , then pick up the printed objects at their local office supply megastore , or have them shipped to their home or business â € ” not unlike the photo - and document - printing service the company already offers			1
the project was announced today at @entity18 by @entity3 printer manufacturer @entity19 , who is partnering with @entity4 to provide its new @entity22 printers for the service			2
the @entity22 printers employ an innovative method to generate objects , using reams of paper that are cut and printed while being stacked and glued together			1
this technique allows for a high - resolution layer thickness of 100 microns , similar to that of the @entity31 2 , but not quite as fine as the 25 - micron capability of the form 1			0
the new printers also incorporate the ability to add photorealistic coloring â € ” something that more common plastic printers ca n't yet achieve			0
but while the glued paper is said to have a wood - like hardness , the arrangement of the layered paper grain will require special consideration for certain design layouts ( this can affect other types of 3 - d printers as well )			1
and while the company says it is able to be drilled , tapped or screwed , its material properties are unknown compared to traditional materials like real wood or steel			0
still , the move by an established corporation to offer 3 - d printing further legitimizes the adoption of the rapidly growing field by the mass market			2
similar services currently exist , being offered by companies like @entity61 and @entity62 , but this is the first to be made available from a chain retailer			0
@entity6 will launch in the @entity65 and @entity66 in the first quarter of 2013 , and will be rolled out to other countries shortly afterword			1
no word yet on pricing or when it will reach the @entity72			0
