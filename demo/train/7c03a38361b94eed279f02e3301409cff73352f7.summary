@entity0 -- getting divorced is never an easy thing , but a city district in northwestern @entity4 wants to make it just a bit harder			1
since march 2012 , the civil affairs bureau in @entity7 of @entity8 -- an urban area with more than 1 million residents -- has limited the number of divorce filings to no more than 15 a day			1
couples eager to part ways but arriving too late are told to return together the next day			2
this little - known local rule became a hot topic nationwide last week after a divorcing couple failed to obtain a slot and complained to state media			1
amid a barrage of criticisms of a wrongheaded government agency interfering with civil liberties , officials defended their " well - intentioned " system			2
" it 's aimed at saving families from impulsive divorces , " @entity25 , head of marriage registration at the @entity28 civil affairs bureau , told state media			1
" some couples , even after getting a slot , eventually decided not to file for divorce after having some time to calm down and think it through			0
" @entity28 is n't the only local government facing accusations of being overzealous in its effort to save marriages			0
in february , civil affairs officials in @entity42 -- a city of 9 million people in eastern @entity4 -- stirred heated debate for deciding not to accept any divorce filings on @entity46			1
still , government statistics show divorce rates in @entity4 have soared in recent years			1
last year , @entity8 -- where @entity7 is located -- saw 17,670 couples go their separate ways amicably , while the number of divorces nationwide shot up to 3.5 million			2
both figures represented an increase of more than 10 % over 2012			0
experts seem divided on the root causes			0
some have pointed to a government report that says a quarter of married @entity4 women have suffered various forms of domestic violence			2
others have even referred to numerous news articles on couples " fake - divorcing " to skirt restrictions on the number of houses a family can legally buy in major cities			0
since its 15 - slots - per - day rule went into effect , @entity28 has bucked the trend and witnessed a decline in the number of divorce filings two years in a row			1
while admitting the measure 's limited impact in wider society , officials remain unapologetic for trying to preserve the sanctity of marriage			0
" every family we save counts for something , " @entity25 , the marriage registration chief in @entity28 , was quoted by state media as saying			0
