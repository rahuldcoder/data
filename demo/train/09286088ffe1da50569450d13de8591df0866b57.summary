-- on friday night , @entity2 technology journalist @entity1 was brutally hacked			0
in a chain of events that @entity1 would unravel in the following days , hackers took advantage of security holes at @entity8 and @entity9 to gain access to his @entity12 account			1
they then took over his @entity15 account , remotely wiped all data from his @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , and took over his @entity21 account as well as the @entity21 account of his former employer , @entity24			2
the incident might seem small on its surface -- just one person 's information , not a huge data breach of credit card numbers			1
but this one very public incident , thoroughly documented by @entity1 in a @entity2 article , could be a wake - up call to many who store their information with cloud - based services , including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity37			1
" my experience leads me to believe that cloud - based systems need fundamentally different security measures , " said @entity1			0
" password - based security mechanisms â € ” which can be cracked , reset and socially engineered â € ” no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing			0
" the hackers used fairly basic techniques to accomplish the hack			1
they found @entity1 's home address and e-mail address online , and after some back and forth with @entity8 tech support , used it to get the last four digits of @entity1 's credit card number			1
they called @entity9 customer support pretending to be @entity1 and used those four numbers along with same billing address to verify his identity , gaining access to @entity1 's @entity12 account and the associated			1
me account was @entity1 's backup e-mail for his @entity15 account			0
once they were in his @entity15 , the hackers could reset passwords for all the key accounts that used @entity15 , including @entity21 accounts			0
once in , the hacker spammed @entity1 's @entity21 followers and deleted all the data from his various devices			2
the remote wipe option is a security service offered by @entity9 as part of its @entity77 / @entity18 / @entity19 feature			1
if devices associated with the @entity80 are stolen , the owner can execute a remote wipe to prevent their data from falling into the wrong hands			0
the motivation for the crime seems to be rather banal			0
in conversations with @entity1 , one of the hackers responsible revealed he just wanted @entity1 's three - letter @entity21 handle , @ mat. " i honestly did n't have any heat towards you before this			2
i just liked your username like i said before , " he wrote @entity92			0
remotely wiping @entity1 's computers and mobile devices , permanently erasing data including a year - and - a - half of photos of his young daughter , was also done without any real reason			2
" yea i really am a nice guy idk why i do some of the things i do , " the hacker wrote			0
@entity9 responded with an official statement on monday night , saying , " @entity9 takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an @entity9 @entity80 password			2
in this particular case , the customer 's data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer			1
in addition , we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely			1
we are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers ' data is protected			0
" however , while investigating the breach over the weekend , @entity1 said he confirmed twice with @entity9 tech support that only two pieces of information are required to get access to an @entity12 account : a billing address and the last four digits of the credit card associated with the account			1
@entity2 reporters say they tested the hacker 's approach by successfully trying it on another account themselves			0
@entity8 has not yet commented on the report .			2

hackers use possible @entity8 and @entity9 security holes to delete tech *writer* 's data
hackers use fairly basic techniques to accomplish the hack
@entity9 : " we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely "
