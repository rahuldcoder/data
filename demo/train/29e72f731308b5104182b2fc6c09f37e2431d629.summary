the time is nearing for a potentially definitive @entity3 response to alleged @entity5 government atrocities and an increasingly violent military crackdown in @entity7 , president @entity0 said in an exclusive interview broadcast friday on @entity10 's " @entity9			1
" the @entity3 remains " one indispensable nation " in the volatile @entity11 and elsewhere , @entity0 told " @entity9 " anchor @entity13			1
" we have to think through strategically what 's going to be in our long term national interests			0
" asked by @entity13 whether the @entity3 government is now facing a " more abbreviated time frame " on key decisions in @entity7 and @entity5 , @entity0 repeatedly gave a one - word response : yes			1
the president sat down with @entity13 on thursday evening -- after having delivered a speech in @entity24 , @entity25 -- to discuss a wide range of critical domestic and international issues			2
these included upheavals abroad , soaring college tuition at home , a possible government shutdown this fall , and politically sensitive revelations of illegal surveillance by the @entity35			0
@entity0 plans to embrace a hero at the @entity37 read the interview transcript asked about claims by anti-regime activists in @entity5 that @entity42 's government used chemical weapons in an attack that was said to have killed more than 1,300 people , @entity0 responded that officials are " right now gathering information " and that " what we 've seen indicates that this is clearly a big event of grave concern			1
" " it is very troublesome , " the president stressed			0
@entity0 said @entity3 officials are pushing " to prompt better action " from the @entity60 , and are calling on the @entity5 government to allow an investigation of the site of the alleged attack outside @entity58			1
" we do n't expect cooperation ( from the @entity5 government ) , given their past history , " @entity0 conceded			1
he quickly followed up with a warning , however , that " core national interests " of the @entity3 are now involved in @entity5 's civil war , " both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating , as well as needing to protect our allies , our bases in the region			1
" a new push on college affordability @entity0 spoke to @entity10 on the first day of a bus tour selling his new higher education affordability proposal , which includes a plan to create a college ratings system designed to better inform parents and students while pressuring colleges and universities to lower skyrocketing tuition costs			1
the president told @entity13 that the rapidly rising cost of a college education has been fueled both by liberals who have n't demanded that colleges control costs , and conservatives who downplay the burden placed on students			2
@entity0 : conservatives , liberals share blame on college cost spike " the problem we 've got right now is that when it comes to liberals , they 've tended to say , ' let 's just give more money to the system and increase student loans and grants and aid , ' " @entity0 argued			2
" and then , you know , you 've got some on the right who 've said , ' money does n't matter , and young people should be able to figure it out on their own			0
' " in 2011 , students owed an average of nearly $ 27,000 in loans , making it second only to mortgages in consumer debt			0
lawmakers on @entity124 recently struck a deal maintaining current low interest rates on loans			0
higher education loan rates are now tied to the market rates , however , which means they will rise in the future			0
@entity0 called the congressional compromise a " stop - gap measure " that does n't deal with the underlying problems of rising costs of higher education			1
pressure for tougher action on @entity5 @entity13 asked @entity0 to respond to harsh criticism from his 2008 presidential rival , @entity143 sen. @entity142 , who recently argued on " @entity9 " that @entity3 's credibility in the region has been damaged by a slow administration response in both @entity5 and @entity7			1
" i am sympathetic to senator @entity142 's passion for helping people work through what is an extraordinarily difficult and heartbreaking situation , both in @entity5 and in @entity7 , " @entity0 replied			1
" but what i think the @entity3 people also expect me to do as president is to think through what we do from the perspective of what is in our long term national interests			2
" @entity0 warned against getting " mired in very difficult situations ... ( and ) being drawn into very expensive , difficult , costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region			2
" @entity0 : @entity5 will ' require @entity3 's attention ' @entity13 noted it has now been a year since @entity0 first said the use of chemical weapons in @entity5 would cross a " red line " and force a tough @entity3 response			1
administration officials confirmed in june that chemical agents were used in april , resulting in an uptick of military aid to rebels that did little to assuage @entity37 critics			0
" if the @entity3 goes in and attacks another country without a @entity60 mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented , then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it , " @entity0 told @entity13			1
" do we have the coalition to make it work ? " he asked			0
" you know , those are considerations that we have to take into account			0
" the costs of military action " have to take those into account as we try to work within an international framework to do everything we can to see @entity42 ousted , " @entity0 concluded			2
@entity5 under pressure to allow probe of chemical weapons claim the crisis in @entity7 @entity13 also asked @entity0 about a growing congressional push to cut off over $ 1.2 billion in @entity3 aid to the military - backed government in @entity7 , where a military crackdown on supporters of deposed president @entity205 has resulted in the killing of roughly 900 people			1
@entity0 : aid to @entity7 no longer business as usual so far , the @entity210 has canceled upcoming military exercises and delayed the delivery of fighter jets , and is reviewing all other aspects of assistance , including military and economic help			1
" my sense ... with @entity7 is that the aid itself may not reverse what the interim government does , " @entity0 said			1
" but i think what most @entity3 would say is that we have to be very careful about being seen as aiding and abetting actions that we think run contrary to our values and our ideals			2
" the president said the administration is currently " doing a full evaluation of the @entity3 - @entity7 relationship , " and that there is " no doubt that we ca n't return to business as usual , given what 's happened			1
" " there was a space right after mr. @entity205 was removed in which we did a lot of heavy lifting and a lot of diplomatic work to try to encourage the military to move in a path of reconciliation , " the president added			0
but " they did not take that opportunity			0
" a looming fight with congressional republicans @entity0 was slightly less diplomatic in his discussion of politics back in @entity253 , where a number of @entity143 congressional critics are spoiling for a fight this fall over the possibility of a partial government shutdown after september 30 and the need to raise the federal debt limit			2
@entity0 : republicans privately ' agree ' with me specifically , conservatives in the @entity143 - controlled @entity264 are debating using both issues as leverage to force new budget cuts and defund @entity268 , the president 's signature health care reform law			1
" there is nobody out there who thinks that us not paying bills we 've already racked up is good for the economy ( or ) is appropriate , " @entity0 argued			2
so why are we even talking about ? " as for shutting down the government , that 's " bad for not just people who work for the government , but all the contractors ... and the defense folks and everybody who is impacted by the services that they receive from the federal government , " @entity0 said			2
but " republicans , after having taken 40 votes to try to get rid of @entity268 , see this as their last gasp			0
" the @entity35 and privacy concerns asked about the latest revelation that the @entity35 inadvertently pulled some @entity3 ' e-mails , @entity0 argued that the news shows " all these safeguards , checks , audits , ( and ) oversight worked			1
" @entity0 said he is confident no one at the @entity35 is " trying to abuse this program or listen in on people 's e-mail			2
" but he said there are " legitimate concerns that people have " regarding rapidly changing surveillance technology			0
" there 's no doubt that , for all the work that 's been done to protect the @entity3 people 's privacy , the capabilities of the @entity35 are scary to people , " @entity0 said			1
" what i recognize is that we 're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards			0
and as technology moves forward , that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance , " he added @entity0 : @entity35 revelations show oversight worked the @entity325 reported last week that an internal audit of the @entity35 found the agency had broken privacy rules " thousands of times each year " since 2008			0
the 2012 audit , the @entity325 reported , found 2,776 incidents of " unauthorized collection , storage , access to or distribution of legally protected communications " in the preceding 12 months			0
the newspaper received the internal audit from @entity35 leaker @entity339 , who sparked the controversy over domestic surveillance when he first stepped forward in june			0
an empty nest and a new dog asked about life at home at @entity37 , @entity0 said he 's starting to brace himself for the day when his daughters , @entity348 and @entity349 , head off to college			1
" what i 'm discovering is that each year , i get more excited about spending time with them , " the president said			0
but " they get a little less excited " about spending time with their parents			0
the first couple is dealing with the change in part with the help of a new dog -- a @entity363 water dog named @entity364			0
" i think there is an element from @entity368 and me , we see what 's coming , and we need to make sure that we have somebody who greets us at the door when we get home , " @entity0 noted			1
the @entity349 also have another @entity363 water dog , @entity374 , who was brought by the first family to the @entity37 in 2009			0
preparing to be ' empty nesters , ' the @entity349 turn to @entity364			0
