-- @entity1 and @entity2 are hiv discordant			1
he has hiv ; she does not			2
they always have protected sex , which was never an issue , until they wanted to start a family			1
the @entity9 recommends that people like @entity2 , who are in a discordant relationship , take pre-exposure prophylaxis , or @entity13 , to protect against personal @entity3 exposure			1
but there is little research on how the medications affect a fetus			0
meanwhile , adoption can be complicated when one parent is @entity3 positive			1
assisted reproduction using ivf and techniques such as sperm washing ( ridding the sperm of the virus before creating an embryo with an egg ) , are costly and illegal in some states , like @entity30 in 2007 , when the @entity31 were living there			1
so what 's the best way for @entity3 discordant couples , like the @entity31 , to have children ? it 's a question being asked more often as people with @entity3 are living somewhat normal lives with the disease and perhaps getting married and wanting to start a family			1
it is something at the top of mind on this @entity43 , which this year is focused on achieving an @entity45 - free generation			0
the @entity9 estimates there are 140,000 mixed - status heterosexual couples , but that number is based on a 1996 study ; experts say the number is much higher today			0
the @entity31 are open about their journey to parenthood because they hope others will benefit from their experience			1
@entity56 was diagnosed with @entity3 when he was 12 , infected by contaminated blood products he received as treatment for hemophilia , a rare genetic blood disorder			1
" it was scary , " @entity1 remembers			1
" there was definitely a time period ... toward the end of high school , college , you know , i was n't sure i would be here now			0
" it was the ' 80s , and @entity45 was all over the news			0
so was the story of an hiv - positive teen named @entity72 , who was expelled from his high school in @entity74 , @entity75 , after revealing he had the disease			1
in @entity79 , @entity80 , ninth grader @entity56 was telling his school he , too , was @entity3 positive			1
@entity82 was in the gym when @entity2 and his father , a physician , spoke to the school			1
" it 's ok to touch him			0
it 's ok to share your pencil with him			0
it 's ok to drink from the water fountain			0
you can use the same lavatory , " she remembers being told			0
the discussion laid the groundwork for her connection to the @entity3 community			1
@entity2 and @entity1 went to prom together and then lost touch			1
six years passed before @entity1 called @entity103			1
that phone call lasted two hours and sparked a bicoastal relationship			0
eventually @entity1 relocated from @entity106 , @entity107 , to @entity108 to be with @entity2			1
they bought a house and got married			0
@entity2 dreamed of having children			2
but how ? " i was 26 and it was n't immediately needed , so i just knew that we would start asking questions and do the research and figure out what we were going to do , " @entity2 says			1
@entity2 read everything she could find about how a heterosexual married couple with one @entity3 partner could make a family but could n't find answers			1
not in research and not from their own health care providers			0
" i do n't think that doctors did n't want to share it , i just think they did n't have it , " @entity2 says			2
" we 're just not the usual clientele			0
" in march 2007 , the couple testified at a @entity30 @entity132 hearing to repeal a law banning assisted reproduction techniques using @entity3 - infected sperm			1
the law was repealed and through the process they met experts who had the answers they were seeking			0
over dinner one night , one such expert made a suggestion the @entity31 describe as shocking : having unprotected sex			1
because @entity1 had an undetectable viral load and they were in a monogamous relationship , the physician explained , the risk of @entity2 becoming infected with @entity3 from unprotected sex with her husband was low			1
@entity2 says it was somewhere between a 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 4,000 chance every time			2
it would n't mean throwing away the condoms			0
this was timed according to @entity2 's ovulation ; on her most fertile days they 'd try			2
they decided to try this approach for a few months			0
if either one of them changed their mind at any point they would stop			0
" you check in and you 're like , ' i 'm feeling really nervous about this today , are you still ok with this ? ' and vice versa , " @entity1 says			2
some days , he woke up reminding himself that @entity2 was more likely to get struck by lightning than to become infected this way			2
other days , he 'd wake up wondering what on earth they were doing			0
after five tries in two months , @entity2 was pregnant			2
the excitement was building , but it was too early to breathe a sigh of relief			0
they still did n't know if @entity2 was infected with @entity3			1
at three months , @entity2 's test results came back negative , which tempered concerns as they shared the news of @entity2 's pregnancy with family and friends			1
subsequent tests at six and nine months were also negative			0
at that point , they knew their daughter would be ok			0
now 4 , @entity72 is healthy and happy , just like her mom			0
she loves @entity191 , swimming and even likes green vegetables			0
she does n't know that her parents might be considered pioneers by some -- that they 've paved the way for other @entity3 discordant couples			2
she knows her dad has hemophilia and takes medicine			0
they 'll explain the rest later , @entity2 and @entity1 say			1
@entity2 insists it was n't about luck ; she says their decision was supported by science			2
" it 's sort of like getting in the car			0
we wore our seat belts			0
it would have been more shocking for @entity2 to have gotten @entity3 than to have not , " he says			1
@entity2 does n't think about @entity3 every day			1
she says it 's like a third , silent partner in their marriage			0
the @entity31 may decide to expand their family , and if they do , they will see what science says at the time			1
they say they may decide to take the same approach			0
or , @entity1 says , when the time comes , they may try assisted reproduction			2
for now , @entity1 is living the life he once thought he 'd never live to see			2
he 'll get to die of a heart attack in his 70s , @entity2 jokes , just like everyone else .			2

@entity1 and @entity2 wanted to start a family , but @entity1 is hiv - positive
they sought out *technology* and medical *guidance* about what to do
the answer *surprised* them : try having unprotected sex
the @entity31 now have a healthy daughter , and @entity2 does not have @entity3
