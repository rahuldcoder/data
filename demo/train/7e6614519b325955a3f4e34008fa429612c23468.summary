-- @entity2 's latest novel on @entity3 is n't even out yet and it 's already reportedly a shocker			1
this weekend , @entity4 published excerpts from @entity7 's upcoming book , " @entity3 : @entity8 , " that reveal a crucial character , mr. @entity3 , has been killed off			1
cue the collective gasps of horror from around the world			0
fielding first introduced heroine @entity3 in 1996 with her best - selling " @entity14 , " a cheeky look at a 30 - something single woman 's adventures with life and love in @entity20			1
during that initial installment , @entity3 gets to know the prickly but sweet @entity3 , and in the follow - up , 1999 's " @entity3 : the @entity23 , " he proposes			2
but by the time we get to " @entity8 , " @entity3 is dead and @entity3 is a 51 - year - old widowed mother of two			1
( at least they got to have kids before he kicked the bucket -- the reason behind which is still unknown			0
) @entity7 said when the new novel was announced that @entity3 would be in a different place with " @entity8			1
" " my life has moved on and @entity3 's will move on , too , " the author said in february			1
" i hope people will have as much fun reading it , as i am writing it			0
" that 's questionable , considering some of the intense reactions fans have had to the news of @entity3 's death			1
" just found out @entity3 , from the # @entity43 sequel , was killed off ! ! ! ! i ca n't handle this ! " said one fan			2

posted another : " if @entity3 is really dead i have no reason to live anymore			2
# overlydramatic # bridgetjones # whywouldshedothis " yet another clung to some " @entity61 " - inspired hope : " could it be that @entity3 fakes his own death & ends up as a lumberjack in the @entity65 ? " the user queried			0
either way , it is apparent that @entity3 has moved on			0
in the @entity4 excerpt , she describes her indecision between attending pal @entity71 's 60th birthday party , and spending time with her " toy boy , " a nearly - 30 - year - old named @entity74			0
both " @entity14 " and " @entity80 " were adapted into movies starring @entity76 as @entity3 and @entity77 as @entity3 , and a third movie is expected to be on the way			0
