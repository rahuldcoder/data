" @entity4 and @entity5 and their wives have been disappeared ; they are being held incommunicado in an unknown location , a severe breach of @entity2 and international law , " @entity26 , a spokesman for the campaign , said in a statement			1
" given the lynch mob - like calls for their execution by numerous @entity2 politicians and clerics , there is reason to be deeply concerned for their safety and well - being , " @entity26 said			2
state - run @entity44 aired video of @entity2 lawmakers earlier this month chanting , " @entity48 ... execute them			2
" the human rights organization also pointed out that " a ' safe house ' is considered a place for the secret detention of high security - value detainees , which is not under the control of the judiciary or any other monitoring mechanisms			1
the @entity58 and @entity2 intelligence agencies are well - known for using safe houses for all methods and techniques to get confessions from detainees without scrutiny or pressure from other legal bodies			1
" " given the use of so - called safe houses to mistreat opponents of the government in the past , the campaign finds it deeply disturbing that @entity4 and @entity5 have reportedly been removed to such a facility , " the statement said			0
@entity2 authorities began rounding up many government opponents this month amid calls for protests like those that have swept across @entity82 and the @entity83			2

despite the security crackdown , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in @entity90			0

one person was shot and killed during the protests , according to @entity2 's semiofficial @entity110 news agency			0
several others were injured and listed in serious condition as a result of the shooting , which the @entity2 government blamed on " agitators and seditionists			1
" the @entity2 government source claimed saturday that @entity2 are disturbed by the opposition 's demonstrations			1

the people believe their peace is being disrupted and they want these protests to stop , " the source said			0
@entity129 secretary of state @entity128 on wednesday accused @entity2 of a repressive crackdown on protesters and political opponents in the past 10 days , including the killing of peaceful demonstrators by security forces			0
international journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in @entity2 , where the government has cracked down on the media and maintains tight control of state - run news organizations			1
