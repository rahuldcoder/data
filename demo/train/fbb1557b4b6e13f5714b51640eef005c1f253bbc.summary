@entity0 , @entity1 -- even though @entity7 @entity6 are now wisely folding their tents , their disarray this week over extending a payroll tax cut has left a sour taste at year 's end in @entity11 , contributing in no small part to an even bigger political story : the resurrection of president @entity15 and his fellow @entity16 heading toward the 2012 elections			1
after the debt ceiling debacle of last summer , the conventional wisdom among many political analysts was that @entity15 would go the way of president @entity22 , that @entity6 would lose a few seats in the @entity7 but retain control , and that the @entity6 would surge into power in the @entity26			1
in short , republicans were looking for a clean sweep			0
who believes that now ? @entity15 is still highly vulnerable and could lose , but the @entity2 poll coming out of the field this week reveals a remarkable turnaround , especially in the past month			1
in a mid-november survey , when asked which candidate they were more likely to support , registered voters gave @entity36 a lead of 4 percentage points over @entity15 , 51 % to 47 %			1
the mid-december survey found an 11 - point switch ; @entity15 now has a 52 % -45 % edge over @entity36			1
against @entity42 , @entity15 has a 16 - point lead , 56 % -40 %			2
( ironically , the one @entity6 candidate who does as well against @entity15 as @entity36 is rep @entity45 , trailing by the same 52 % -45 % margin			1
) it is too early to tell how much @entity16 prospects for the @entity26 and @entity7 have improved , but senior republicans are worried			2
@entity51 pointed out one straw in the wind wednesday night on @entity2 's " @entity54			2
" : the @entity26 race , where a poll has shown @entity16 populist @entity57 grabbing an unexpected lead over @entity6 populist @entity59			1
only a few months ago , the @entity59 forces were supremely confident			0
@entity59 has seen how much danger the payroll tax mess can pose for his re-election and was one of the first to condemn @entity65 for rejecting a @entity26 compromise that had overwhelming , bipartisan support			1
for @entity59 and other @entity6 candidates in blue and purple states , the hard - liners in the @entity7 are playing directly into a narrative that @entity16 have been promoting for months : that @entity11 is broken because the @entity6 has become hostage to the tea party			1
with sentiment toward the tea party now running 49 % -33 % unfavorable in @entity2 polling , that is potent stuff			2
the truth about the breakdown in @entity11 is much more complicated ( @entity16 deserve ample blame , too ) , but @entity6 congressional leaders have so mishandled the payroll tax issue that they have made it easy for the charge to stick			1
as @entity86 said in its scathing editorial , the @entity6 has also strengthened @entity15 's arguments that he is more on the side of middle - class taxpayers than @entity6 are			1
no wonder the @entity7 is quietly chortling and senior republicans like @entity6 leader @entity93 pressed hard for @entity65 to cave on the payroll tax cut			1
there are two other major forces at work that have been lifting @entity16 hopes			2
one is the quality of the @entity6 presidential race			1
with less than two weeks left before the @entity104 caucuses , as the @entity105 reports thursday , it is apparent that no one has captured the imagination of @entity6 voters			2
we are back to where we started : a sense the field is weak and people wondering whether a @entity114 or a @entity115 will get off the sidelines			2
all primary campaigns draw candidates toward the extreme end of their parties , but this year , with so many debates , there has been a danger all along for @entity6 that moderates and independents would also be driven off			2
( in the @entity2 poll , moderates now give @entity15 a sizable lead against every @entity6 candidate			1
) the other force driving the change in outlook is @entity15 himself			0
what he does best , as we have learned , is campaign			0
in domestic affairs , he has been far better at that than governing			0
he and his team apparently made a decision after the debt ceiling fight that he should be much less involved in leading @entity11 and instead hit the campaign trail			0
from my perspective , that 's not good for the country -- witness how appallingly little has been accomplished this fall on jobs and the deficits -- but it seems to be working for his re-election			0
none of this is to say that @entity15 and @entity16 have become clear favorites for next fall			1
the fluidity we have seen among @entity6 primary voters may well show up in the general electorate			0
as @entity36 has been arguing , the @entity6 is likely to close its ranks more fully once a nominee has been crowned			0
the improving tone of the economy -- also a factor for @entity15 -- could well be short - lived : as the @entity163 reported thursday , economists tend to think that growth could slow again next year			0
and that dark cloud called the euro zone is still hovering			0
even so , we are witnessing an important change in the political landscape -- and it could be lasting			0
republicans well remember the mid- 1990s when they seized power in @entity172 and speaker @entity42 went mano - a - mano with president @entity173			0
for a while , @entity174 had the upper hand , but @entity173 then outmaneuvered him on two governmental shutdowns -- and when the momentum turned in @entity173 's favor , he rode it to an easy re-election			0
no one should doubt that could happen again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0
