editor 's note : @entity4 @entity2 is a professor of @entity5 at @entity6 in @entity7			1
she has served in the @entity8 and the @entity9 , and worked for the @entity10 as a special consultant			0
from 1997 through 2001 , she was a member of a research team , sponsored by the @entity13 , studying police integrity in three major police departments in the @entity16			1
she is the author of " @entity17 in @entity18 " ( 2002 ) and co-author of " @entity20 " ( 2006 )			0
@entity2 says police officers make decisions based on their awareness of potential danger			1
@entity7 ( @entity25 ) -- we teach our children to think about what others feel before they act , but as grown - ups we frequently assume we understand what others do without ever having walked in their shoes			1
president @entity34 expressed his opinion about a police officer 's interaction with @entity39 professor @entity38			1
" the @entity42 police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home , " the president said			1
was it stupid behavior or was it an understandable result of police procedure -- the culture , or rather sub-culture , of this profession			1
people depend on police in a time of trouble but are quicker than lightning to judge harshly when things go wrong			1
but the most important question in this case is : did they go wrong ? one needs to understand that the interaction between a police officer and a suspect is just part of a larger context			2
when a neighbor calls the police to report a burglary in progress and a police officer is dispatched to respond , a decision - making process begins for the officer			2
police work is about sub-cultural contexts , about war stories , about suspicion , about unpredictability , about danger and fear for one 's life			1
police officers make their decisions based not just on a given situation but also based on their prior experience , the experience of those they have worked with and the stories they have heard about incidents that happened in the past			1
a call to respond to a burglary in progress generates a series of images that prepare a police officer for an encounter -- a dangerous encounter that can possibly end with a loss of life			2
not long ago one of my students , an officer in the @entity103 , was killed trying to stop a robbery in progress			0
police officers hear about these stories and unlike the members of the public who forget a story , no matter how sensational within a day or two , police officers carry these stories as their secret weapons			1
this is part of their armor			0
an officer responding to a burglary in progress arrives at a scene with a heightened sense of danger , anxious and ready to go into fighting mode			1
yes , the professor identified himself as a legitimate occupant of the premises			2
however , he was not arrested for trespassing			0
he was arrested for disorderly conduct			0
police officers arriving at the scene of a suspected burglary in progress do not put down their armor of suspicion just because somebody proved to them that they are the legitimate occupants of the dwelling			1
police encounters can become deadly when officers assume that , on the surface , everything appears to be in order			1
it is their sixth sense of suspicion that helps them assess the situation in a way that members of the public would not consider reasonable			2
it is this precise quality of suspicion that goes beyond a reasonable doubt that sets them apart from the larger public and can be understood only by the members of the force			0
a person usually does not break into his own house -- it is true that it can happen , and it apparently did in this case -- but this is not a standard behavior that , once explained to the officer , should mandate an automatic approach to put down your guard			0
the officers look at the scene of the event they were called to as their domain , their turf , their territory , where some order has been disturbed and they were called to restore it			2
a famous police scholar , @entity173 , once wrote that we call the police when " something ought not to be happening about which something ought to be done right now ! " the professor may have raised his voice , and this would appear now as justifiable under the circumstances			1
but , when somebody challenges the authority or the domain of a police officer who was just called to restore order , the discretionary process of the officer is not the same as that of a bystander			2
the professor seemingly lost his temper			2
one might say that this is fine , given the circumstances			0
the police officer did not lose his temper , he just made a decision that might have been an outcome of an error of judgment , or which one might say could have been justified given the totality of the circumstances			0
ireport.com : " shame " on @entity38 there are over 19,000 different law enforcement agencies across the @entity16			0
each agency has its own standard operating procedures and rules and regulations , including the ones that would appear relevant to this case			0
however , there are no national standards that can be applied when officers respond to a call for a burglary in progress			0
only very general standards could be applied and even then the evolving situation would dictate how officers would proceed after confronting the suspicious person			0
when an individual under suspicion becomes agitated , insults the officer and becomes aggressive , the majority of police departments would allow the officer to make an arrest			0
neither was the president nor all the others who are quick to pass judgment			0
what went on in the officer 's head is something that i can only guess but , based on over 30 years of experience in the doing , teaching and studying of the police profession , i would venture to say that race had nothing to do with the behavior displayed and that the sub-culture of police work dictated the action , more than any possible bias or prejudice			0
i do believe that racial profiling exists in the minds of many -- not just police officers but also regular citizens			1
but police departments around the country are working very hard to fight these ill - conceived notions and , in recent years their diversity recruitment and selection processes , paired with modules in sensitivity and multicultural training , have had an impact			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : president @entity34 said police acted stupidly in arresting professor
she says act could be viewed as result of officers ' awareness of potential danger
she says officers arrive at such scenes with heightened sense of danger
