@entity7 , @entity8 -- " let it be known from this day forth , the @entity1 movement has seen the creation of the first ' @entity3 , and @entity4 will be remembered for all time as the venue of its birth			1
" an affirmation that was not so much spoken by opening ceremony supremo @entity12 - film director and @entity14 winner of " @entity16 " fame - but implied with so much of his vision for the 30th @entity1 curtain raiser			1
music was the heartbeat of the $ 42.3 million spectacular , an aural backdrop arguably worthy of the " @entity23 " hype , creating an almost tangible cultural dna of what the organizers feel is to be @entity28			1
from the androgynous swagger of @entity30 ( his hit " heroes " introduced @entity33 to the stadium ) , to the drugged - out funk of the @entity36 ; the rolling grooves of @entity54 " to the punky - punch of @entity57 's " firestarter " ; the petulance of the @entity40 ' " satisfaction " to the raw , rebellious sound of the @entity43 ; and form the staccato rap of @entity45 ( born a stone 's - throw from the @entity7 ) to euphoria of @entity49 's bespoke - written tracks a montage of era - defining tunes were melded together to provide a snapshot of distinctly @entity28 sounds			1
and if all of that was n't enough , music was also used to answer the biggest question that had hung over the event like a judge 's gavel : how do you top @entity66 ? easy , by getting a @entity67 to end the show ! @entity1 opening ceremonies are often a anomalous mix of political grandstanding , national branding and artistic re-visioning of the global gathering that the @entity75 represents			1
the response of @entity4 organizers to the grandiose opening ceremony of the @entity79 , such was the scope and spectacular nature of the @entity83 curtain - raiser , was always going to pique curiosity			1
it seemed apt to end the evening with the voice of one of the @entity67 , who had directly influenced many of the other acts who had performed earlier in the night			1
in fact , the @entity92 even sang @entity94 's " come together " as part of their set			0
the @entity67 may well be a band form another century but the 28 million people who follow the now defunct band 's official @entity101 page suggests they are loved the world over as much as ever			1
@entity66 may have had an athlete running around the roof of the arena but @entity8 had @entity107 play out with " @entity108 " leaving television viewers from around the world no doubt humming a chorus that even language proves no barrier to : " nah , na , na , nananna nah , nananna nah ... " etc. put simply , it rocked : a spell - binding moment that touched the soul in the way the splendor of the @entity66 opener failed to with such force			1
the vision had always been clear even back in the @entity122 -- when @entity124 's legendary axeman @entity123 and stunning soul singer @entity125 belted out " @entity131 " from the top of a double - decker bus to provide soundtrack to the handing over of hosting duties from @entity83			2
it may have been seen as a risk by many , but for some the tone and topic matter captured @entity28 idiosyncrasies well			2
@entity139 - features editor for the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , @entity28 's pre-eminent weekly music magazine , told @entity9 : " what 's really interesting is the set included bands like @entity144 and @entity36 , organizers tipping their hat towards the cult element of @entity148 , which is very different to what you see at an event like the @entity152			1
" i think @entity28 likes to see itself as having a bit of edge			0
the @entity43 were only recording for a couple of years , but people bought into their rebellious nature the world over			0
it 's funny how this anti-establishment band is now seen as one of the nation 's great musical acts			0
there 's also an element of embracing the outsider in @entity28			1
@entity144 were the ultimate cult band , coming from @entity167 , a small independent record label , and being from @entity169			0
i would imagine most @entity170 are n't familiar with bands like @entity144 , so it 's great to showcase them			0
" the @entity1 is a cultural event and the @entity75 is about hammering home the sense of location as much as anything , it 's natural for music to be a big part of that especially because it 's so integral to our identity in @entity28			1
" as for @entity67 , they are the biggest band of all time			0
their template is the one that was followed through the generations , and i think if you ask any visitor to @entity28 to name a few of the favorite things about this country , i 'm sure the @entity67 would still be one of them			1
" statistics would also suggest that @entity12 had been correct to assume that many around the world see @entity28 identity closely entwined with that of its musical exports			0
sales of @entity28 music abroad reached $ 2.9 billion in retail value in 2011 with @entity28 artists accounting for almost 13 % of global sales of recorded music , according to @entity206 ( the representative body of the @entity209 ) figures			1
compared to @entity28 's share of world trade in goods ( 2.7 % ) , the trade of recorded music is four times the nation 's average share of trade in services , accounting for 12.6 % of the global market , according to figures from the @entity220			1
in 2011 for example , @entity221 became the fourth @entity28 artist in five years to claim the best - selling artist album in the world , following in the footsteps of @entity227 , @entity228 , and @entity229			2
the @entity8 's second album , 21 , sold 18 million copies , accounting for 1.6 % of all albums sold in the global music market that year			0
thanks to the success of new faces on the scene , such as @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 , the @entity206 states that one in every eight albums sold this century in @entity170 alone were produced by a @entity28 act			0
in @entity246 , @entity28 acts accounted for 52.7 % of all sales			0
@entity248 , the chief executive of @entity206 -- a body that represents independent and major record labels in the @entity28 -- told @entity9 in a statement : " i think @entity28 people are more obsessed by music than any other people in the world , they buy more cd albums per capita than any other nation , it 's fundamental to our life			2
" 180 million singles were sold in the @entity28 last year			2
we ran a survey last year to ask whether the @entity28 population thought that we 'd made an important contribution to world music			2
eight out of 10 thought we did , and the same number said they were proud of the music @entity28 produces			2
" @entity67 were particularly important in paving the way internationally			0
their invasion of the @entity170 really raised the profile of the quality that is produced here in the @entity28			0
whether it 's punk or dub step , we have a great tradition of being innovative			0
we 're a nation which , given the size of our economy and population , punch way above our weight in music			0
" without doubt we are a musical superpower , alongside the @entity170 , and if anything the cultural influence of @entity28 's music is increasing as our communications are increasingly digital			2
" ultimately , the success of the opening ceremony to the @entity4 can probably only be judged properly with the perspective of hindsight and when measured against the others that have gone before it			1
but , arguably , by putting popular music at the center of the showpiece @entity12 , and the local organizers , focused on an area where @entity28 can still boast of superpower status			2
maybe @entity66 and @entity8 were n't so different in their approach after all			0
now , back to the " @entity305			0

music was the heartbeat of the $ 42.3 million @entity1 opening ceremony spectacular
former @entity67 , @entity107 ended the night by playing " @entity108 "
@entity140 : " they 're tipping their hat towards the cult element of @entity148 "
