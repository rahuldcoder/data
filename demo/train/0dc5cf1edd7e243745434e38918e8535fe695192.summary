-- @entity1 and @entity2 have both played down suggestions that saturday 's " @entity5 " showdown will decide the @entity7 league title			1
with eight matches left in the season , the two bitter rivals are locked on 77 points at the top of the table with @entity2 ahead by just one goal on " for - and - against " differential			1
@entity1 coach @entity16 said his team would treat the match -- traditionally the biggest fixtures in the @entity21 schedule -- as " a final " but insisted that defeat would not be terminal for either team 's title hopes			1
" if there were only three or four games to go i would say it is an almost decisive match , but when there are seven left afterwards it 's not so much -- but it is very important , " he told reporters on friday			2
" it 's not a final , but we need to play as if it was one			0
it 's a game where the winner will strike a blow to the other			0
" @entity1 triumphed 6 - 2 in the @entity7 capital last season to move seven points clear with four games to play , and cruised to the title			1
since then , @entity2 replaced interim coach @entity46 with @entity47 and new club president @entity48 underwrote a huge spending spree to sign stellar stars such as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			2
" the 6 - 2 is unrepeatable			2
these things happen once in a lifetime , no more , " @entity16 said			0
@entity1 won the corresponding home fixture 1 - 0 in november with a goal from striker @entity59 , so a draw would give the @entity61 the advantage on head - to - head record if both teams end the season still level on points			1
@entity47 , with his future in the balance , knows that @entity2 need to win			2
" we will go out for the victory , " the @entity71 told reporters on friday			2
" a draw is always a bad result for my team , we 've never gone out looking for a draw			0
we 've picked up a lot of victories away from home , and more at the @entity83 , and this game is not going to be an exception			0
" we have to show why we are leaders			0
we 've always gone out to take the game to our opponents from the start and it will be no different on this occasion			0
" the league does not end tomorrow			0
there will still be 21 points in play and matches against difficult opponents			0
this is an important match , but whoever wins will make a big mistake if they think they have won @entity21 , and the same goes for whoever loses because there will be seven more matches to play			1
" @entity1 will again be without @entity59 , who injured a calf in the warmup to last weekend 's 4 - 1 win over @entity107 and then missed the @entity109 crushing of @entity110 in which @entity111 scored all four goals			1
@entity114 fullback @entity113 also misses out , having suffered a thigh injury on tuesday , but central defender @entity116 returns after his @entity118 ban despite receiving a similar knock against @entity107			0
@entity2 will again be without injured @entity120 playmaker @entity52 , who has not featured since the @entity109 last - 16 tie with @entity122 on march 10			1
midfielder @entity54 and defender @entity124 return from suspension after missing sunday 's 2 - 0 win at @entity127 , but @entity128 and @entity129 are still sidelined			1
@entity2 have won 50 of the 79 encounters between the two teams since 1929 , losing just 15 times .			1

@entity2 and @entity1 locked on 77 points at the top of the @entity7 league table
real have slight edge by just one goal on " for - and - against " differential with eight games left
both teams ' coaches insist that victory will not decide the @entity21 crown
