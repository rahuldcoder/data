in @entity1 , bicycles are grown from the ground			1
making the most of the southern @entity6 country 's bamboo plants , two @entity7 and two @entity1 have set up a company that is crafting high - end , lightweight bicycles with frames made out of the locally - grown wooden weed			1
dubbed @entity13 , the company is putting its custom - built @entity1 bikes on roads around the world , offering pedal enthusiasts a unique ride while helping to empower local communities back home			1
" it 's a plus to have a product that is grown in @entity6 , made in @entity6 and exported to everywhere else in the world , " says @entity13 co-founder @entity21			2
" it 's rare that we have such incentives coming through -- mostly we are importing stuff from the rest of the world			0
" eye - catching , super light and extremely durable , bamboo bicycles have gained traction in recent years , becoming a popular alternative to traditional steel or aluminium bikes			1
the material , one of nature 's fastest growing resources , has great shock absorbing abilities that contribute to a smooth and eco-friendly ride			0

" we produce it in a manner that is pollution - free and is n't by any chance devastating to the global warming issues			0
" read more : rise of the ' repats ' the idea for @entity13 first surfaced in 2004 when two young @entity7 , @entity58 and @entity59 , visited @entity1 on a six - week university field trip			1
the two college friends were impressed by the hospitality of @entity1 but also witnessed first - hand the economic hardship that many of the country 's people were suffering			1
" we noticed that unemployment was well over 60 % , " says 27 - year - old @entity58			0
" everybody we talked to did n't have jobs or could n't find jobs and when we looked around nobody had decent bicycles			2
" @entity58 and @entity74 decided to return to @entity1 straight after their graduation			2
they teamed up with @entity21 and fellow @entity1 @entity78 and together they set the @entity13 operation in motion in july 2007			1
so far , the company , which employs some 40 people , has produced about 500 hand - made bamboo frames , but this year alone it expects to crank out another 450			1

but from planting the bamboo in the @entity1 forests to shipping the bicycles to the concrete urban jungles across the world , the process of manufacturing the bikes is far from an easy task			1
@entity58 says the bamboo is chosen carefully for its quality and thickness			0
it is then cut and treated before being dried and placed in a jig			0
the frame is then joined with glue and wrapped in natural fibers and affixed to its conventional metal components			0
" it is quite labor intensive -- each frame takes between 40 and 60 man hours to make , " says @entity58			0
" every piece of bamboo is having different colors , different bend , so every frame is unique			0

" in rural areas where there 's no roads , no fuel , nothing , these bicycle ambulances that are very low maintenance allow these people to be ferried to the clinic , " says @entity58 , noting that the company has so far , distributed over 900 " zambulances			1
" running such a business in @entity1 , however , is not without challenges			2
notwithstanding difficulties such as huge transportation costs , high import rates , currency fluctuations and bureaucracy , @entity13 ' founders say that attracting capable staff has been hard at times			2
" finding good workforce has been challenging , " admits @entity58 , " but that 's one of the reasons that we came in @entity1 , " he adds			0
" we saw a need and we saw people that needed opportunities , so on one hand this is a challenge but on the other hand we are happy to help			0
