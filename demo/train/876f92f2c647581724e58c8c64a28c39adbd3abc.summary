-- @entity1 has been following @entity3 football for more than 20 years but reasons to celebrate have been few and far between			1
" it 's like the @entity3 saying ; ' you always think your children are the most beautiful no matter how ugly they are , ' " the 30 - year - old education specialist told @entity0 in @entity6			1
dogged by poor performances on the pitch and corruption scandals off it , the @entity3 game has been far from beautiful			1
but die - hard soccer fans like @entity1 finally have something to cheer about			0
@entity18 , a soccer team based in the southern city of @entity20 , became @entity22 champions on saturday , beating @entity24 's @entity23 to claim @entity3 's first continental title in 23 years in a stadium packed to capacity with fans wearing the team 's blood - red colors			1
" they are persistent and never surrender , " said @entity1 , who watched the match on television at home			0
@entity18 will now play in the @entity35 in december , pitting the team against the likes of @entity39 giants and reigning @entity41 champions @entity40			1
previous winners of the tournament include @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			0
@entity3 last tasted international success at club level in 1990 when @entity49 lifted the trophy of the now expired @entity51			2
its national team has also punched below the country 's weight			0
despite being one of the country 's most popular sports -- president @entity58 is said to be a big fan -- @entity3 failed to qualify for the @entity60 and did not enter the running for the 2018 tournament			2
@entity18 's rise to the top of @entity22 football has been fast and furious and some say it could be @entity22 's first " superclub			1
" in early 2010 , the team was bought by @entity69 , the boss of property developer @entity70 and @entity3 's 13th richest man , according to @entity73			2
he paid 100 million yuan ( $ 16.4 million ) for the club , shocking many as the team had recently been relegated to the second division of @entity3 's league			2
in 2011 , they won the @entity80 and claimed the league title for the third time this year			0
@entity83 , an editor at the @entity3 - language @entity84 , credits @entity69 's deep pockets as the main reason for the team 's success			1
the club has spent at least 1.5 billion yuan ( $ 250 million ) in the past three years , according to the @entity90 , recruiting domestic stars and foreign players like @entity94 striker @entity93			0
the team is led by @entity96 , who coached the @entity98 team that won the 2006 @entity35			2
" the @entity18 model is similar to @entity44 and @entity100 , where they win simply because they invest , " @entity83 told @entity0			2
" they have a strong team and a large number of foreign players			0
they are good because they dare to throw in their money			0
" but he said @entity18 's success does n't represent the big picture			0
a bribery investigation that led to several players , referees and managers serving jail terms has left many fans disillusioned with the @entity3 game			1
@entity118 , the author of " @entity119 : one man 's quest to teach the @entity3 to love football " , says corruption reaches down to the sport 's grassroots , which suffer from a lack of investment			2
" parents will bribe the coach to get ( their child ) into the team , teams will bribe the referee to win the game , " said @entity118 , who has lived and played football in @entity3 for more than 20 years			1
hopes are high that @entity18 's arrival on the international soccer stage will give a much - needed boost to the country 's football system			1
the president of the @entity143 , which runs the region 's premier tournament , said that @entity18 's win would infuse new life into @entity3 football and spread the game to a wider audience			1
" i am confident that this will benefit not only the @entity80 but also the national team in a big way , " said @entity150			0
but they will have a hard time convincing fans like @entity157 , an engineer , who spends his spare time glued to the @entity159 , @entity161 's @entity160 and @entity163 's @entity162			0
he says he wo n't make the effort to watch @entity18 's @entity35 match against @entity167 side @entity166 in december			1
" the time difference is a challenge , but i still choose foreign matches because they are much more professional , " he told @entity0			0
@entity0 's @entity172 reported from @entity6 , @entity171 wrote and reported from @entity173			0

@entity3 team @entity18 have become @entity22 champions
hopes high that *victory* will give @entity3 football a much - needed boost
@entity3 game has been dogged by scandals and poor performance
they will now *compete* in @entity35 in december
