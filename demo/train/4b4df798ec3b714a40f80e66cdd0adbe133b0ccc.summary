this week , three more women came forward to accuse @entity2 of drugging and assaulting them			1
that brings the total up to more than 30 women who have accused the comedian and actor of sexual assault in events going back decades			1
all of the allegations have passed statutes of limitations , which means rape charges can not be filed			1
the women 's reasons for not coming forward earlier amount to : fear of retaliation , and fear no one would believe them			1
a few days ago , it appeared that former " @entity22 " cast mate @entity21 was condemning the women making the allegations			1
" forget these women , " @entity25 had quoted @entity26 as saying			2
" what you 're seeing is the destruction of a legacy			2
and i think it 's orchestrated			2
" she was subsequently blasted throughout the media for what many took to be a dismissal of rape victims and a defense of @entity2			1
on wednesday , in an interview with @entity41 , @entity26 said she was misquoted and attempted to clarify those comments			2
what she 'd meant to say was that , " this is not about the women			2
this is about something else			2
this is about the obliteration of legacy , " she said			2
she blamed the media for declaring " guilt without proof " and described @entity2 as " a genius			1
" over the past several months , allegations have painted @entity2 as a sexual predator , a serial rapist , a man who , over many decades , allegedly drugged and assaulted women , many of whom had viewed him as a mentor and guide			1
still , no charges have been filed			0
he has not stood trial			0
he has not been convicted			0
( his attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations			0
) which raises the question : could a man accused of such things by so many ever deserve defense ? what if the man is someone you call a friend ? it 's fairly easy for most of us to condemn @entity2 , because he is not a person we actually know			1
for @entity26 , the matter becomes more complicated			0
cutting out a stranger is one thing ; cutting out a friend is another			0
and yet that 's what @entity26 has to do -- that 's what we all have to do			0
we all have friends who have acted badly in one way or another			0
maybe -- and i mean maybe -- you can continue a friendship with someone who has been accused , once , of rape , if you have asked the right questions and satisfied yourself that the one allegation is not true			1
but you can not say , " it 's none of my business , " or " we do n't know the story			0
" the simple fact is you can not be friends with a man whose accusers are in the double digits , even if this man is still walking free -- perhaps especially if this man is still walking free			0
not if you want the rape of women to stop happening			1
that @entity2 likely wo n't be charged for any of the alleged crimes he is accused of is a scenario not at all unique to him			1
every year , literally countless men who engage in sexual violence against women do not face charges , for reasons as varied and familiar as those given by the women in the @entity2 scandal			1
the law is not perfect , and has limitations			0
that 's where the rest of us come in			0
boycotting these men , excluding them from our lives , not being their friends , their defenders , their devil 's advocates			0
this is where and how we take a stand .			0
