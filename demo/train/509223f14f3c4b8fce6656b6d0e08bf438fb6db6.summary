-- @entity1 and @entity2 have reached an agreement that will return a massive collection of @entity6 artifacts to the @entity8 country -- a settlement that could end a lengthy dispute over relics excavated nearly a century ago			1
a high - level university representative pledged in a 90 - minute meeting friday to return the artifacts excavated from the ancient @entity6 ruins of @entity17 , @entity1 president @entity12 said			1
" the @entity1 government is grateful for this decision and recognizes that @entity2 conserved these parts and pieces that otherwise would have been dispersed in private collections throughout the world , and perhaps would have disappeared , " @entity12 said in a statement			1
@entity2 also expressed its satisfaction that the disagreement may be over			0
" @entity2 is very pleased with the positive developments in the discussions about the return of @entity17 artifacts to @entity1 , " the university said in a statement saturday			1
" it has always been @entity2 's desire to reach an agreement that honors @entity1 's rich history and cultural heritage and recognizes the world 's interest in ongoing public and scholarly access to that heritage			1
" the controversy had taken on added heat recently , with @entity12 asking @entity46 president @entity45 in june to help @entity1 regain custody of the artifacts			1
thousands of @entity1 also demonstrated in several cities in june demanding the return of the collection			1
@entity52 had remained high in @entity1 , with foreign minister @entity53 telling @entity0 two weeks ago that an agreement was expected soon			1
the pieces would be returned at the beginning of 2011 -- in time for the country 's celebration of the 100th anniversary of @entity17 's rediscovery , @entity12 said			2
the artifacts were excavated from the site by historian @entity63 in 1912 during the first of several expeditions he led to @entity1			1
@entity63 was an adjunct professor of @entity67 at @entity2 between 1907 and 1915			0
his collection of archaeological pieces , documents and photographs are housed at the university 's @entity72			1
after they are returned to @entity1 , the relics would be handed over to @entity76 del @entity75 , where investigators will continue studying them , @entity12 said			1
@entity1 officials have demanded their return for at least seven years and filed a civil lawsuit against the university in april 2009 in the @entity82			1
@entity12 said he hashed out the deal friday with former @entity85 president @entity84 , who directs the @entity86			2
there are between 4,000 to 40,000 pieces , depending on how they are catalogued , said @entity2 spokesman @entity90			2
but only about 350 are museum quality pieces , he told @entity0			2
@entity92 , an anthropologist from @entity93 , studied the skeletons in the @entity2 collection in 2000			0
much of the @entity2 collection , he said , consists of shards and fragments , not complete objects that can easily be shown in a museum			0
" the collection , " he said , " is one of the most valuable @entity6 collections there is			0
in terms of beauty , though , the collection there is pretty junky			0
it 's not museum quality			0
" the controversy over who has rights to the collection stems from @entity63 's expeditions			0
" there 's some difference of opinion whether @entity63 had a legitimate permit to export , " @entity92 said			0
@entity1 foreign minister @entity53 pointed out that a november 1916 letter from @entity63 to the @entity121 , which funded the @entity1 expeditions , stated that the artifacts were on loan			1
" now they do not belong to us , but to the @entity1 government , who allowed us to take them out of the country on condition that they be returned in 18 months , " @entity63 wrote about skeletal remains to @entity128 of the @entity121			1
" the whole matter has assumed a very large importance in the eyes of the @entity1 , who feel that we are trying to rob their country of its treasures , " @entity63 wrote in the letter , which @entity0 obtained from the @entity1 government			1
but @entity2 's stewardship of the artifacts has often been lost in the argument , @entity92 noted			0
" unfortunately in issues of bureaucracy , the injured party -- in this case @entity1 -- gets swept up in nationalism and human rights , " the anthropologist said			1
@entity17 , the 15thcentury @entity6 citadel where the relics were found , is a national treasure in @entity1			2
the government declared the site a @entity156 in 1981 , and the ruins were designated a @entity158 in 1983			0
that makes the relics even more significant to many @entity1			2
" @entity17 is @entity1 's premiere self - identity and tourism site , " @entity92 said , pointing out that the ruin gets 1 million visitors annually and @entity1 earns $ 100 million in ticket and permit sales			2
on the flip side , there 's the issue of @entity2 's investment			0
" @entity2 spent a lot of infrastructure money conserving the objects and preserving them , " @entity92 said			0
@entity2 could argue , he said , that @entity1 does not have the facilities to properly store the artifacts			2
" it 's true that the infrastructure quality in @entity1 is very poor , " @entity92 said			2
" there are objects rotting there			0
" @entity12 , @entity1 's president , acknowledged those difficulties in his statement friday			1
" with all these goods in @entity1 , " he said , " we need a place where the @entity187 can exhibit them and we will request a supplemental credit to parliament , a budget enabling of the millions required to enable a house , a building where these artifacts can be exhibited , where archaeologists from @entity196 , @entity1 , @entity2 and around the world can continue its studies			2
" @entity2 also may have been reluctant to return the artifacts because it did not want to set a precedent			0
" once a museum returns something , " @entity92 said , " other countries would jump in and want something back			0
" not to mention , he said , that " every museum hates to give all their stuff away			0
" @entity92 , who has spent every summer for the past 26 years digging through the ruins of north and central @entity1 , understands each side 's argument			1
" i have sympathy for both sides , " he said			0
" in this case , there have been missteps and there should have been more diplomacy on both sides			0
