-- nearly two years after falling in love , " @entity3 " alumni @entity1 and @entity4 are opening up about their relationship			1
season 5 heartthrob @entity1 , 31 , and season 3 's runner - up @entity7 , 24 , met in the spring of 2010 when both signed on to costar in the @entity12 revival of the musical " hair			1
" " we became best friends through ' hair , ' ironically not through ' @entity3 , ' " says @entity4 , who now plays as a @entity16 mob boss 's daughter on the @entity18 soap " @entity19			1
" " it just blossomed into a beautiful relationship			2
" the attraction was immediate for @entity1 , who , along with @entity7 , had to get naked onstage for each performance of " hair			1
" " she said , ' you 're not looking , right ? ' " @entity1 says of the first time they disrobed in rehearsals			1
" and i was like , ' oh no , not at all			0
' but i was looking , and i was like -- sold ! " but @entity1 had his eye on @entity7 before that moment			1
" i was already interested in her as a person before i got to see her with no clothes on , " he said			0
" but [ that ] sealed the deal			0
" after the musical closed in june 2010 , @entity1 , 31 , returned to @entity42 while @entity7 , 24 , went on tour with the musical " 9 to 5			1
" the time apart was difficult , @entity1 says : " if you love somebody , whenever they 're not around , it sucks			2
" so when @entity4 's tour ended last summer , @entity1 found a way to keep her close			1
" she came to @entity52 and kept saying , ' i 'm looking [ at ] apartments , ' " he recalls			0
" and i was like , ' why do n't you just stay with me ? ' the moment she got here , she realized i was n't going to let her get an apartment			0
it was like , either we 're doing this or we 're not			0
and , thankfully , she was all in			0
" adds @entity7 : " i crashed on the couch -- more like , i crashed in his bed -- and just did n't leave			0
" these days , the couple 's not only living under the same roof , but working together			2
they recently formed a music group with two friends called @entity69 , and @entity1 , who earned a @entity71 nomination for co-writing " idol " pal @entity72 's hit " it 's not over , " is also producing country songs for @entity7			1
" she 's my best friend , " he says			2
