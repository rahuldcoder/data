-- it 's grown from selling clothes to a handful of friends inside a small dorm room to a popular fashion website featuring more than 1,000 stylish items			2
admittedly , it 's been quite a journey for @entity10 , the co-founder of @entity11 , an online marketplace that links buyers of clothes and accessories to sellers across @entity17			1
launched just over a year ago , the growing website features a mix of new and used fashion items -- from custom - made pieces by young designers and boutique stores to well - preserved clothes from women looking to de-clutter their closets			2
" we simply merged the idea to sell affordable fashion to people who just did n't want to pay too much , " says @entity10			2
" and also give people an opportunity to sell off clothes they do n't want anymore in their closet but are still in good condition -- and you can be able to get extra cash , " she adds			1

" they would tell me , ' well , where did you get this dress from ? ' " she recalls			0
" i said , ' if i see something that you like then i will get it for you			0
' and then it suddenly became a bi-weekly thing , where they would stop by my room and select what they liked -- so that really kick - started it off			0
" after graduating with a marketing degree , @entity10 then decided to expand her small venture , going into business with her high school friend @entity57			0
using @entity10 's living room as their base , the two business partners called their shop @entity11			1
" when we met the first time to try to exchange clothes and buy from each other as friends , we had , like , 49 items so we picked 49 , " says @entity10			2
while the two entrepreneurs still use @entity10 's living room as a physical store twice a week , they see the biggest opportunities for growth online , where buyers can connect to sellers 24 hours a day , seven days a week			1
@entity10 says they started with about 10 customers a month and they 're now getting about 100 , while last year there were some 2,500 fashion items sold through the website			0
" there is huge potential in this market , " says @entity10			0

indeed , the widespread adoption of mobile money platforms like @entity107 has turned @entity17 into " a global leader in mobile money transfer service , " according to @entity110 , a @entity111 - based think tank			1
but while websites such as @entity11 connect users and buyers within @entity17 , other online marketplaces such as @entity116 enable small - scale artisans and producers sell their handcrafted creations not only locally but also across the world			1
@entity116 , which means marketplace in @entity122 , allows jewelry makers and craftspeople to participate in the international trade			0
it helps them link directly with buyers from around the world , even if they do n't have access to a computer or a bank account			2

consumers then can buy directly from the designers , with @entity137 facilitating shipment and payment to the vendor			1
@entity143 , the @entity17 co-founder of @entity116 , says the site receives tens of thousands of hits per month and has helped artisans to sell thousands of products to consumers from places such as the @entity111 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			1
