-- many are speculating whether an all - woman jury is a benefit or detriment to @entity5 , who stands accused in a @entity7 court for murdering @entity8			1
women jurors are a recent phenomenon in @entity12 history			0
in the 1960s , numerous states still prohibited women jurors			0
the thinking was that women 's place was in the home , not in the jury box			2
women 's jury service was n't placed on equal footing with men 's until a 1975 @entity12 @entity24 decision ( @entity23 )			2
an earlier @entity7 case vividly illustrates this history			1
in the late 1950s , @entity28 stood trial for murdering her husband with a baseball bat			0
@entity33 's guilt was determined by an all - male jury because at the time women in @entity7 had to volunteer for jury duty , while men were required to serve			1
few questioned whether a female defendant tried by a jury of men confronted a " jury of her peers			1
" @entity33 and her attorneys , however , did pose the question and appealed the guilty verdict all the way to the @entity12 @entity24 on the grounds that the all - male jury denied her due process			1
one of @entity33 's attorneys noted that when she asked her male acquaintances whether a man tried by an all - female jury would receive a fair trial , they answered with a resounding " no ! " the 1961 @entity24 ruling in the @entity33 case upheld a state 's right to define women 's jury service differently than men 's			1
the court ruled that " woman is still regarded as the center of home and family " and for this reason a woman can " be relieved from the civic duty of jury service			2
" times certainly do change			0
the 1975 @entity77 decision overturned @entity33 , and women were able to participate equally in the democratic act of deciding community justice			0
in 1994 , the @entity24 ruled that peremptory challenges could no longer be based on a prospective juror 's sex			0
that is , lawyers could no longer dismiss women ( or men ) from a jury panel because of their sex			0
women have clearly broken the glass ceiling in the courtroom			0
but the public 's attention to the all - female jury in the @entity5 case shows that we are not yet gender blind when it comes to the justice system			1
many people ask right away -- how will these women weigh the evidence , deliberate and affect the outcome of the trial ? the answer is likely to be that the all - female jury will have little or no effect on the ultimate decision in this case			1
research shows that no one juror trait , including gender , is an accurate indicator of how a juror will vote			1
rather -- and savvy trial lawyers know this -- the best predictor of whether a juror will side with the prosecution or defense is a mix of gender , race , ethnicity , religion , political ideology , personality , attitudes , and so on			1
jury selection experts understand as well how the complex mix is closely tied to the specific issues at stake in a particular trial			0
jury composition alone rarely shapes the verdict in a trial			2
for example , a 2007 review of the scholarship on jury selection reported that the backgrounds and attitudes of jurors predict less than 15 % of verdicts			0
women are now full citizens when it comes to jury service			0
if a man is being tried by an all - woman jury , he is likely being tried by a jury of his peers			2
the gender makeup of the jury is not likely to be pivotal in determining the verdict in the @entity5 trial			1
the evidence is what matters in the outcome			0
but our public attention to the fact of an all - female jury shows that we are still conditioned to think in gendered ways			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

an all - female jury will hear the @entity5 case in @entity7
@entity166 : the gender composition of a jury will not affect the outcome
she says research shows that no one juror trait , including gender , can determine the vote
@entity166 : public attention to an all - female jury indicates we still think in gendered ways
