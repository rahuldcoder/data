-- few games seem so well suited to the mores of the modern sports fan as rugby sevens			1
with quick - fire matches , end - to - end action and points galore , the speeded - up , pared - down version of rugby union satisfies a 21st - century urge for smaller , faster , flashier fare			2
a newcomer to the sport might reasonably conclude that the game -- seven - a - side , seven minutes each half -- was the result of a recent refashioning of the 15 - man sport , but it traces its roots back to the late 19th century			0
@entity22 public schoolboy @entity21 is famously credited with inventing the game of rugby itself in 1823 , but the abbreviated version was the brainchild of a butcher from @entity28 called @entity29			1
when his local rugby club in the town of @entity32 was casting around for ideas to improve its ailing finances , @entity29 , together with his boss at the butchery , @entity37 , came up with an idea that would change rugby forever			1
recalling the moment some years later , @entity29 said : " want of money made us rack our brains as to what was to be done to keep the club from going to the wall , and the idea struck me that a football tournament might prove attractive , but as it was hopeless to think of having several games in one afternoon with 15 players on each side , the teams were reduced to seven men			1
" sevens rugby kicks off on april 28 , 1883 , @entity55 hosted the world 's first sevens tournament at its @entity59 ground			1
hundreds of spectators turned up to cheer on the home side as they did battle with six teams from neighboring @entity65 towns			1
fittingly , it was the @entity32 team , which included @entity29 , who went on to win and receive a silver cup donated by local ladies			1
barring two interruptions for war , the " @entity75 " has been presented to the winning team every year since , keeping up a proud tradition and ensuring a place on the world sporting map			0
" @entity79 is very much part of the community , " @entity77 marketing director @entity76 told @entity0 's @entity79 show			2
" it 's very much an integral part and is the social hub of the town			1
i think if you mention the name @entity32 anyone , certainly in the western world , will have heard of it and it 's primarily down to the fact that rugby sevens were founded here			1
" @entity29 died in 1939 , aged 80 , long before the game really took off			1
its success would have confounded him , @entity76 thinks , as it does the town 's 1,600 inhabitants			2
" in fact , we have to pinch ourselves , " he says			0
" you have to bear in mind that we do n't own the game of rugby sevens , we are merely its custodians to pass down to future generations so they can enjoy it as much as we have			1
" it was n't so much a passing down as a spreading of the message in the years following the first sevens tournament			2
twelve months later , neighboring @entity112 organized its own event and soon sevens tournaments were a being held all over the @entity65 and further north in @entity115			1
@entity22 audiences got their first taste of the game in 1926 when @entity121 - based @entity120 dr. @entity119 organized the first @entity122 at @entity123			0
sevens goes global with the " auld enemy " persuaded , the task now was to convince rest of the world			2
@entity79 - playing @entity130 nations -- @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 -- were early adopters as the game spread steadily in the decades following @entity135			2
but it was n't until 1973 that the first international sevens tournament took place as part of the @entity141 's centenary celebrations			2
seven countries and a president 's vii took part , with @entity146 beating @entity147 22 - 18 in the final at @entity149 in @entity115			0
two decades later at the same venue , 24 nations contested the inaugural @entity152 -- and an unfancied @entity146 team won again , beating @entity132 21 - 17 in final to lift the @entity154			1
@entity155 , led by sevens legend @entity156 , took the title four years later as the tournament moved to @entity159			1
the @entity160 repeated the feat in 2005 to become the first team to win the trophy twice -- a mark matched by 2001 winners @entity131 in @entity167 's @entity166 earlier this year			2
while the 2013 event did n't attract the spectator numbers that organizers had hoped for , the general trend is of a steady growth in ticket sales			0
" what we have noticed is the change gradually over the years , " says @entity76			0
" @entity177 was purely for rugby aficionados a few years ago , but that has now changed to a degree and it is perhaps getting to be as much of a social event as it is a sporting event			0
" perhaps the best example of this is the @entity185 -- a three - day jamboree held every year since 1976 where a mix of beer , body paint and fancy dress costumes provide a noisy and colorful backdrop to action on the pitch			0
@entity195 dreams away from the alcoholic haze engulfing the @entity198 , @entity196 offers a sober assessment of the game 's ongoing appeal			0
" rugby sevens now is a sport played by athletes , " he says			1
" they are much fitter , much stronger -- it is a faster , more entertaining game			0
someone who perhaps is not a rugby follower can come along to a sevens tournament and enjoy it			2
" participation continues to grow , notably so in the @entity213 where rugby union is currently the fastest growing sport			0
more than one million people ( a third of them women ) play rugby at some level , according to the @entity221			0
turnstiles are also ticking over nicely in the @entity213 with last year 's @entity224 event in @entity225 attracting 64,000 spectators , the country 's record rugby crowd			0
but it is an invitation to the world 's biggest sporting occasion in @entity233 in 2016 that has got everyone in rugby excited			1
the announcement by the @entity236 in october 2009 that rugby sevens , along with golf , would be included in both the 2016 and 2020 @entity239 has provided the sport with a priceless boost			1
the 15 - man game was actually played in the early editions of the modern @entity239 -- founder @entity244 was a fan of the sport 's spirit and ethics			0
so , it seems are today 's @entity236 members			0
" it 's mind - blowing , " says @entity76			0
" considering where it started from , to now look at it as a worldwide @entity195 sport is quite unbelievable			0
" from a butcher 's shop in @entity28 to the top table of international competition , rugby sevens looks like it will be serving up many sporting feasts for decades to come .			1

rugby sevens started in the @entity65 town of @entity32 in 1883
a butcher called @entity29 came up with idea to raise money for his local club
@entity155 and @entity131 have both won the @entity152 twice
sevens will be a part of the @entity276 in @entity233
