@entity0 -- @entity2 is a deeply meaningful annual ritual for @entity3			1
it is singled out as the day to recall a gathering nearly 400 years ago when two clashing cultures -- the @entity7 and native americans -- came together in feast and prayer			2
that 's the history every @entity13 kindergartener making a construction - paper turkey is taught ; that 's the history of cultural cooperation , acceptance and gratitude we celebrate each november			1
today , two distinct cultures , @entity21 and @entity22 , are on the brink of profound and irrevocable change in @entity13 , with immigration a perennially and increasingly thorny political issue			1
there is president @entity30 's promise of comprehensive immigration reform in the first year of his administration , " a priority i will pursue from my very first day , " which has not come to pass			2
instead , he has deported 1.2 million latinos , including 46,000 parents of @entity13 citizens			1
his draconian actions have left tens of thousands of frightened children , whose moms and dads suddenly vanished , living in foster care or as wards of the state			0
then there 's the inflammatory rhetoric from @entity47 presidential candidates , topped by @entity49 's suggestion to build an electrified fence on the border and deploy troops to attack those who try to enter the country illegally			0
what we are witnessing is a clash of cultures in @entity13 that is as excessive as it is pointless			1
the late @entity60 , a renowned @entity61 political scientist , illustrated it in a 2004 essay for @entity64 titled the " @entity65 , " in which he wrote : " @entity67 cultural differences clearly separate @entity68 and @entity3 , and the high level of immigration from @entity71 sustains and reinforces the prevalence of @entity74 values among @entity74			2
continuation of this large immigration ( without improved assimilation ) could divide the @entity78 into a country of two languages and two cultures			0
" @entity60 concluded his essay by discounting @entity84 author @entity83 , author of " @entity85 , " who wrote that the @entity91 dream " exists , it is realistic , and it is there for all of us to share			0
" @entity60 declares , " there is no @entity91 dream			0
there is only the @entity90 created by an @entity21 society			1
@entity74 @entity3 will share in that dream and in that society only if they dream in @entity97			0
" who are the @entity99 ? we are the 50 million @entity78 citizens of all skin colors , nationalities and religions who descend from a rich @entity106 culture -- a culture that @entity108 academics like @entity109 have erased from our history books			1
i observed this firsthand while serving on @entity115 's @entity114 , overseeing the approval of statewide textbooks			2
@entity13 history books typically ignore the epic northward advance by @entity106 pioneers into the southern tier of the @entity78 and fail to discuss the far - reaching contributions of @entity124 from our country 's inception to its present day			1
for example : -- forty - two years before the @entity97 colony at @entity131 , explorer @entity128 founded @entity132 as our first @entity13 city in 1565 , granting @entity115 the longest recorded history of any state			1
the @entity106 flag flew over @entity132 for nearly 200 years			2
-- when the @entity139 was nearly bankrupt , they sent a representative to seek funds in @entity142 , and the money they needed was collected from the public treasury and from private @entity91 citizens to finance the @entity147 , the decisive battle of the @entity148			0
-- the patriotism of @entity124 can not be questioned			0
@entity91 soldiers have served in the @entity151 dating back from the @entity152 to the war in @entity154 with 44 @entity156 recipients			0
about half a million @entity157 fought the @entity158 during @entity160 cpl. @entity159 was the first person to die in the @entity162 , and more than 25 % of the 58,195 names on the @entity164 are @entity124			1
-- @entity106 , not @entity97 , was the first @entity166 language spoken in @entity13			1
there are more than 1,000 @entity78 cities with @entity106 names , as well as the states of @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity71 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity115			1
the @entity78 is the second - largest @entity106 - speaking country in the world			2
most americanos are bilingual , which is a plus since our exports to @entity182 are nearly three times larger than our exports to @entity185			0
@entity91 language skills and cultural affinity give our country a competitive advantage in doing business with a rapidly growing $ 6.4 trillion market of 579 million people in 21 countries plus @entity194			0
oh , and about that first @entity2 ? here are a couple of other things our children 's history books fail to mention : -- in @entity132 on september 8 , 1565 , the @entity106 and the native @entity199 celebrated what could arguably be called the first feast of @entity2			1
that was 56 years before @entity203			0
-- near @entity205 on april 20 , 1598 , some 500 colonists led by @entity206 ate celebrated the end of a grueling expedition across @entity71 's @entity209			0
that was 23 years before @entity203			0
their @entity2 celebration with @entity3 is recognized in resolutions by the @entity215 legislature			2
perhaps if the four million children in @entity78 kindergartens this year -- 25 % of whom are @entity124 -- were taught the truth , not only about the rich history of @entity99 in helping make this country so great , but also about @entity2 , this most @entity13 of holidays , then maybe we would have a healthier attitude on immigration reform and @entity124 in general			1
surely that 's something for which we can all be thankful			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			2

@entity230 : immigration issue has created pointless @entity234 - @entity22 culture clash
he says @entity157 are 50 million @entity13 citizens descended from @entity106 culture
he says they have valid claim to @entity90 and may have had first @entity2
@entity230 : in 1565 , @entity106 settlers in @entity115 and the native @entity199 *sat* down to a feast together
