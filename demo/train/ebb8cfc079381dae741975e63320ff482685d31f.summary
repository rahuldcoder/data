-- last wednesday , a @entity2 fight erupted between technology experts @entity4 , founder and former editor of @entity7 , and @entity8 , a technology researcher and writer , after a screening of @entity0 's documentary , " the new promised land : @entity14			1
" @entity4 said a few very clear things about his view of the state of diversity in @entity14			1
among them : there may be very few african - americans in @entity14 , but despite this @entity14 is a pure meritocracy , and one becomes successful because he or she has a " big brain			1
as an @entity28 - @entity27 entrepreneur , he said he sees significant bias in @entity14 , and even recounted a specific instance where he was told , " you people do n't make good @entity33			1
" first , let me say , i think @entity4 truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy			1
lots of people believe it			2
i would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy			1
there are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people , and do this without seeking any additional capital			1
no matter how talented you are , if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory , you need lots of money before you start			2
not necessarily so with software			0
consumers and businesses , for the most part , do n't care about the ethnicity of their software or internet service vendor			0
so if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply , he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else			0
even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital , explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers			1
but the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded			0
the market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight , mentoring , capital and relationships			1
this part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world			1
and it is much harder for even the most talented african - americans in the tech world to gain access to influential , insightful , connected mentors , let alone investors			1
why is this ? for the most part , people want to work with people who are " like them " or who fit a pattern that appeals to them			0
there is an actual term for this among tech investors called " pattern matching			1
" it 's the idea that , without objective facts , one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria			2
in other words , when they see a particular pattern of " personhood , " they are excited			0
watch trailer for @entity0 documentary " the new promised land : @entity14 " these patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age			1
since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are " better , " it is done all the time			0
the best example of this might be @entity126 from @entity127 , perhaps the most influential of all venture funds , admitting in a @entity130 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs			2
but if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching , i wan na smoke some of what you 've got			2
to be clear , i am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting , " you know i really like this company 's product , but did you notice he 's a @entity143 ? " never happens			1
but i firmly believe , based on my 25 years in this industry , that market makers , both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them , seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective , visceral level , who feel " comfortable " to them			0
they do n't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles			0
they just focus on what does appeal to them			0
@entity161 : @entity4 is right ( about one thing ) they focus on the " patterns " they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of many investors ' ideal pattern , but so are perhaps unacknowledged criteria like race , gender , cultural affinity , etc. on some level this should not be shocking , as it reflects socialization that all of us must work hard and consciously not to act on			0
is this racist / sexist / ageist ? well , in this context , using incendiary labels is only likely to make people more defensive			0
the bigger question is , is it a problem ? absolutely			0
it 's not just a personal impression			2
in a recent study , industry analyst @entity185 found that less than 1 % of all venture capital money went to digital start - ups with @entity27 founders in 2010			1
is it possible to overcome these barriers ? i have			0
i have developed successful , best - selling , award - winning products and i have raised tens of millions of dollars			2
but it is only by a sheer persistence and focus that few other people -- white , black , or otherwise -- have			0
i would never suggest that i am smarter than anyone else , but my @entity199 - in - " @entity201 " - like determination has made my successes possible			2
yes , i have definitely had help and support , but compared to some , not so much			0
in fact , some people get far more support than others			0
for example , when a top tier venture capitalist writes a $ 5 million check to a 19 - year - old with a barely beyond napkin stage idea , no customers and a fragile technology because they " present well , " then clearly something else is at work beyond merit			1
this exact scenario may not be common , but it does happen			0
but it does not happen for african - american , or for that matter , @entity224 or female entrepreneurs			2
so the bottom line is , if the level of determination that i have was required from everyone , no matter their race , on some kind of moderately equal basis , it would indeed be a level playing field -- a meritocracy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

@entity240 : @entity7 founder recently called @entity14 a meritocracy
this started @entity2 spat with @entity28 - @entity27 entrepeneur , who says it 's not so
@entity240 : for minorities trying to connect with mentors in tech field , playing field *uneven*
@entity240 : less than 1 % of venture capital went to digital startups of blacks in 2010
