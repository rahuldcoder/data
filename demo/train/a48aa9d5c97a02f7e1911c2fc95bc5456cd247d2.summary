-- it was supposed to provide the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , but the latest effort to fight homophobia in football is in danger of fading into monochrome			1
@entity10 , a @entity12 - based gay , lesbian and bisexual charity , has teamed up with @entity17 bookmaker @entity15 to promote a campaign which is asking football players across the country to wear rainbow colored laces			1
the organization has sent laces to all 92 professional clubs in @entity25 and the 42 in @entity26 with the hope they will be worn this weekend			2
while some stars such as @entity31 and former @entity25 midfielder @entity32 have been outspoken in their support , others are far from convinced			0
several top clubs have objected to the way the campaign has been handled with reservations over the role of @entity15 -- a betting firm which is notorious for its risque marketing techniques			0
@entity41 was just one club which objected to the bookmaker 's involvement			1
a club spokesman said : " it 's important to say everyone at @entity41 is fully committed to tackling all forms of discrimination			1
we have fully endorsed the principles behind the campaign			0
we have a number is issues with it ... the tone of it , the lack of communication and the commercial part			0
" the @entity61 was also unhappy with the way the campaign had been sprung on its clubs , claiming it would have done its utmost to aid @entity10 if it had been notified earlier			1
" the underlying message behind this campaign is a good one -- indeed we and our clubs have worked hard with government and other stakeholders to ensure the whole equalities agenda is something we are fully aware of and engaged in , " a @entity61 spokesman said			0
" however , we were not consulted about this particular campaign			0
had we been involved earlier in the process we could have worked with @entity10 to consider things like boot deals , the use of particular betting partners , and other issues			2
" it is up to individual clubs and players to decide whether they support this campaign			2
we have let @entity10 know that we would be happy to talk to them in the future to discuss ways in which we could work together			2
" while several top clubs such as @entity87 and @entity88 have also refused to take part in wearing the rainbow laces , @entity10 is adamant the campaign has been hugely successful in drawing attention to homophobia in football			1
@entity95 manager @entity94 has given his players the opportunity to make up their own mind , while @entity99 has said its players will wear the laces for the game against @entity103			1
" it has been a fantastic success , " said @entity104 of @entity10 told @entity0			1
" if you look at the response from clubs and individuals , we 've had huge support			0
" the whole crux of the campaign was to call on people who wanted to wear the laces was to do so			1
it 's not for clubs to force individuals to do so			0
" we want to give as many people who want to show their support the opportunity to do so			0
" while @entity10 has been hugely encouraged by the attention garnered by the campaign , it also acknowledges that it has received criticism for teaming up with a gambling firm			1
@entity15 has courted controversy in the past with its advertising , with one commercial being pulled after it invited viewers to pick out transvestites and asked @entity133 racing fans to " spot the stallions from the mares			0
" " whenever you launch any kind of campaign there is always criticism , " argued @entity104 when pressed on the organization 's decision to team up with the betting firm			0
" working with @entity15 opens up a whole new market and reaches people which @entity10 does n't traditionally deal with			2
" the support the campaign has gathered has blown us away			0
" @entity15 also insisted the campaign has been a success , due to the debate it has stimulated			2
" six days ago this issue was not on the news agenda			0
now everyone is talking about it , which has to be a good thing , " a spokesperson told @entity0			2
" the hashtag @entity157 has been trending worldwide , the majority of feedback is hugely positive and we have had more requests for laces from the general public than we 're currently able to cater for -- so we 've ordered 10,000 more			0
" one of the groups which has been particularly critical of the campaign is @entity163 , which has taken umbrage with some of the language used to promote the laces project			1
it is particularly concerned by the innuendo used and believes the campaign 's tag line " right behind @entity171 " is unhelpful in the battle against homophobia			2
a statement read : " our discomfort is with the reliance on sexual innuendo and stereotypes about gay men and anal sex , as exemplified by the tag line ' right behind @entity171 '			0
" as an initiative with a strong focus on education , we feel it is incongruous to run a campaign aiming to change football culture whilst using language which reinforces the very stereotypes and caricatures that , in the long term , ensure that homophobia persists			1
" ' @entity192 ' may have an important short term advantage of drawing attention to the issue of homophobia in football , but this needs to be followed in the long term with an informed and sensitive discussion around the contested nature of what constitutes discriminatory , offensive language as opposed to acceptable banter			1
" however , @entity15 said it had taken advice from @entity10 " to ensure the tone of this campaign is right			1
" " we 've had a lot of positive support this week from the public in general and other bodies like the @entity212 , " its spokesperson said			0
" we sent the laces out to clubs three days before the campaign went live to give them the opportunity to discuss this internally			2
the laces were accompanied by a full explanatory letter and invitation to get in contact with us if they had any questions			0
" it 's pretty sad that some of the powers - that - be deem this not enough notice when it 's a simple case of players choosing whether or not they 'd like to wear a pair of rainbow laces			1
" @entity15 also brushed off criticism that its involvement had hindered the campaign			0
" the rainbow laces we 've provided are simply rainbow - colored and not branded , so they do not breach any @entity236 rules or clash with any commercial deals , " it said			1
" it 's a real shame that some in the game are using our involvement as a pretty weak excuse to prevent players from making a choice on whether they want to lace up to show their support			0
" however , the opposition has not put off other sports stars supporting the campaign , with @entity251 rugby players also getting in on the act			1
@entity253 , an @entity25 international who plays for club side @entity256 , plans to wear the laces this weekend while former football player turned television presenter , @entity259 , has also spoken of how he will boast the rainbow colors .			1
