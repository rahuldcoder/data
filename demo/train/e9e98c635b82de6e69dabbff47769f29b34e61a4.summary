-- the governor of @entity2 has until friday to decide whether to pardon one of the @entity5 's most infamous outlaws in the killing of a law enforcement officer			1
gov. @entity8 received 809 responses on a special website dedicated to answering a generations - old question : should @entity13 get a pardon in the killing of a sheriff ? @entity8 , a @entity13 buff , is looking at an old promise by another governor , and not the @entity22 's cold - blooded reputation , in deciding whether to issue a posthumous pardon , officials said			1
" i think he will take the responses into account , particularly the learned responses , " said @entity8 's deputy chief of staff , @entity24			1
some 430 people were in favor of the pardon while 379 were against it , @entity24 said wednesday			0
the governor must make his decision by late friday , when his term ends			2
@entity13 , who was born @entity13 but was also known as @entity13 and @entity13 , died at the hands of another sheriff , @entity37 , when he was only 21			1
some members of the @entity37 family , including grandson @entity40 , oppose the pardon			0
besides arguing that @entity13 was an incorrigible killer , they want to make sure @entity37 is absolved of any wrongdoing related to the killing and a @entity13 jail escape			1
but @entity24 said the governor will not do anything that casts a cloud on @entity37			2
" we consider @entity37 a true hero of the @entity5			0
" some residents , including gov. - elect @entity51 , said there are more pressing issues facing the state , but @entity24 said wednesday that the pardon consideration " has n't take away from our attention to them			0
" @entity59 defense attorney @entity58 , who volunteered to handle the case for free , filed the petition for the pardon			0
" a promise is a promise and should be enforced , " she wrote			0
@entity37 killed @entity13 on july 14 , 1881 , in @entity64 weeks after @entity13 escaped from a jail			1
the sheriff , legend has it , was hiding in the dark and shot the kid when he entered a room			0
@entity37 was gunned down in 1908 at age 57			0
@entity8 will be deciding only the matter of a promise to @entity13 made by territorial gov. @entity75 , @entity24 said			1
" we 're not offering a blanket pardon for everything he did			0
" @entity75 -- who had also been a @entity80 general in the @entity81 and wrote the novel " @entity82 " -- had promised to grant @entity13 amnesty for the fatal shooting of @entity86 sheriff @entity85 and other " misdeeds " if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder			1
@entity13 cooperated , but the pardon did n't happen			1
according to @entity91 and other historians , @entity13 at one point wrote to @entity75 , asking him to honor the deal			2
the @entity95 argue @entity13 decided to flee house arrest , making the pardon moot			2
he eventually was convicted in @entity85 's death and was sentenced to death , the petition states			1
but he escaped from jail on april 28 , 1881 , killing two deputies			0
" still , regardless of @entity13 's crimes , the motives of @entity8 or the hollowness of posthumous justice , it all comes back to @entity75 's promise			1
a deal is a deal , and 129 years does n't change that			0
@entity13 is owed a pardon , " @entity91 wrote earlier this year in the @entity111			1
the @entity95 do n't buy that argument			0
" if @entity13 was living amongst us now , would you issue a pardon for someone who made his living as a thief and , more egregiously , who killed four law enforcement officers and numerous others ? " the @entity37 family wrote @entity8 last fall			1
@entity123 said there is no written proof that @entity75 made the promise and noted that the charges were federal , which did not give the governor the right to make the offer			1
but @entity131 said a written promise is not necessary and there is ample evidence and letters indicating it was made			2
and , she said , @entity13 was convicted of state charges after federal ones were dismissed			2
@entity75 's great - grandson , @entity139 , also opposes the pardon for some of the same reasons			0
like @entity37 , @entity75 said a pardon would possibly dishonor his ancestor			0
@entity24 says that @entity8 does not challenge @entity75 's integrity			1
" we are strictly concerned with the application of executive power , with any commitments made on behalf of the then - territory and now state of @entity2 , and with the equal application of the law , " @entity24 told @entity0			0
popular history has @entity13 gunning down 21 men , but many historians say the number was closer to nine			2
according to other legends , @entity13 did not die at @entity37 's hands and is not buried in @entity64 , @entity2			1
he went to @entity161 and became known as " @entity162 , they say			0
poppycock , the @entity95 argue			0
they asked @entity8 to sign a petition signed by 100 people that reads , " whereas we the undersigned accept and agree the traditional history of sheriff @entity37 and @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , and believe that @entity13 died at @entity37 's hand ; therefore we oppose a postphumous ( sic ) pardon for @entity13 as @entity168			1
" but @entity131 said @entity13 kept his bargain by testifying and should receive the pardon			2
the attorney said at least two killings attributed to @entity13 were self - defense and five others could have been done by others			2
evidence shows that " it 's ambiguous here who were the bad guys and who were the good guys			0
" " governor @entity75 did not keep his end of the deal , which was to pardon mr. @entity13 for all outstanding charges , including the pending indictment related to the death of sheriff @entity85 , " @entity131 wrote last week			1
" this injustice should be corrected			0
" " why would he ( @entity13 ) surrender himself ... unless there was something in it for him ? " @entity131 asked .			2
