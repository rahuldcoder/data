@entity1 's @entity0 has written a letter in @entity4 asking @entity6 youths not to judge @entity7 based on the @entity9 terror attacks , in a message published on the cleric 's website and @entity14 account			1
in the post , titled " to the @entity28 in @entity29 and @entity30 , " ayatollah @entity16 calls on young people to seek out their own understanding of @entity7 , and he criticizes the media 's portrayal of @entity21 following the massacre of 16 people at the @entity25 satirical magazine and at a kosher supermarket in @entity27 this month			1
" the recent events in @entity25 and similar ones in some other @entity6 countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them , " @entity16 's letter reads			1
" i am addressing you , [ the youth ] , not because i overlook your parents , rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands ; and also i find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts			0
" the @entity27 attacks , which have provoked a wave of anti-islam protests in the @entity52 , were retribution for @entity9 's lampooning of @entity7 over the years			1
the magazine 's first issue after the attack , which features a caricature of the @entity59 on its cover , has sparked demonstrations across the @entity7 world			2
but the leader of @entity1 , where chants of " @entity65 " have been a familiar refrain at friday prayers and parliamentary sessions since the @entity70 's founding in 1979 , strikes a more conciliatory tone in his message to young people in the @entity52			2
" i do n't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of @entity7 , " his letter reads			0
" what i want to say is : do n't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today 's world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices			0
do n't allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of @entity7			0
" @entity16 also riffs on @entity6 history , explaining that the @entity88 and @entity29 have a long tradition of oppressing people of " color and non-christians			2
" he describes his admiration for chastened @entity6 historians who are , in his words , " deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the @entity99 and @entity100 or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the @entity104			0
" @entity16 calls on readers to ignore media portrayals of @entity7 : " receive knowledge of @entity7 from its primary and original sources			1
gain information about @entity7 through the qur'an and the life of its great prophet , " he writes			0
" why does the power structure in the world want @entity7 thought to be marginalized and remain latent ? " @entity16 asks readers to ask themselves , then : " i would like you not to allow the derogatory and offensive image - buildings to create an emotional gulf between you and the reality			1
" the @entity0 finishes with a hopeful message that " future generations would write the history of this current interaction between @entity7 and the @entity52 with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment			2
" @entity16 's letter comes at a time of thawing relations between @entity1 and the @entity88 , as the two longtime adversaries try to hammer out a deal on the future of @entity1 's nuclear program			1
@entity135 even sent a letter to @entity16 in october , pointing out that they share a common enemy in @entity139 , the @entity140 terror group that has seized huge chunks of @entity142 and @entity143			0
but diplomatic progress has not stopped the @entity16 from bashing the @entity52 on social media in recent months			2
he called the @entity88 the " enemy " on @entity14 two weeks ago in a tweet about nuclear talks , and in august he blasted the treatment of african - americans in a tweet about the protests after the police killing of an unarmed black teen in @entity155 , @entity156			0
and in november , @entity16 tweeted a nine - point explanation of why @entity158 should be " annihilated " -- a comment that infuriated @entity158 prime minister @entity160 , who urged @entity6 powers to pull out of nuclear negotiations with @entity1			1
