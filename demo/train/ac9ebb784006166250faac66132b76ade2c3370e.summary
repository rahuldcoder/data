a teenager with cancer who touched the hearts of many in the @entity7 with his tireless fundraising efforts died wednesday at age 19 , his mother said via @entity10			1
it is news that will sadden many supporters won over by @entity15 's mix of determination , generosity and good humor in the face of his terminal illness			1
while he lost the battle to stay alive , he achieved a remarkable feat : having set himself the challenge of raising some $ 17,000 for a teenage cancer charity , he ultimately inspired over $ 5.4 million in donations			1
on his website , @entity28 , he tells how he was first diagnosed with cancer in 2010 , at age 15			1
" in a weird way , i see my first cancer diagnosis as a good thing			2
it was a huge kick up the backside			2
it gave me a lot of motivation for life			0
" he created a " bucket list " on @entity10 of 46 things he wanted to do before he ran out of time			1
" some things on my bucket list include sky diving			1
crowd surfing in a rubber dinghy			0
playing drums in front of a huge crowd			2
i ended up doing it live at @entity54			2
hug an animal bigger than me			0
" but , he says , as he checked off each item , something else happened			0
" since starting the bucket list , i 've had people come up to me and offer to raise funds for me			1
to go on holiday or tick off a new item on my bucket list			1
but i 've actually refused			0
and decided to give the money to charity instead			0
" that decision led to a stupendous fundraising effort that won him the backing of celebrities and the general public , despite doctors telling him in november 2012 that his illness was terminal			2
on the @entity10 page he set up to run that effort , @entity79 , he describes himself as a " teenager with incurable cancer just trying to enjoy life as much as possible , while raising funds for charity to help others			1
" and when his condition took a turn for the worse this spring , the news made national headlines			0
after rallying briefly , he was readmitted to a hospital sunday with breathing difficulties			0
with typical fortitude , the last post he wrote said , " fingers crossed the issue will be resolved and that i 'll be out of hospital soon , i 'll keep you all updated with how i 'm getting on			0
" on tuesday , a message on his @entity10 page from his family said that his breathing trouble was caused by the regrowth of tumors blocking his airways and that he was no longer able to communicate			0
a day later , his mother posted : " my heart is bursting with pride but breaking with pain for my courageous , selfless , inspirational son who passed away peacefully in his sleep in the early hours of this morning , wednesday 14th may			1
" the ongoing support and outpouring of love for @entity15 will help greatly at this difficult time , in the same way as it helped @entity15 throughout his journey			2
we all know he will never be forgotten , his spirit will live on , in all that he achieved and shared with so many			0
" since his death was announced , donations have poured in			0
the money @entity15 raised went to the @entity122 , the charity that helped him through each surgery and each round of radiation and chemotherapy he underwent during nearly four years battling the disease .			1
