-- a locally - produced slapstick comedy was the runaway box office hit last year in @entity3 , but international films swept the top 10 highest - grossing films in the country			1
industry insiders say international influence is only set to grow , as @entity3 censors loosen restrictions on foreign films and more fans make a habit of seeking out the latest blockbusters			1
last year , the country 's box office receipts increased 30 % to over rmb 17 billion ( $ 2.7 billion ) , making @entity3 the world 's second - largest box office on the fifth episode of @entity0 's monthly show " on @entity3 , " host @entity19 traveled to @entity23 to discover what strikes a chord with @entity3 viewers			1
there , she asked @entity28 , ceo of @entity30 , and acclaimed film directors @entity32 ( @entity33 ) and @entity34 what @entity3 filmgoers want to see			1
on the surface , the script for success is not dissimilar to what works in the @entity40 , they said			0
@entity40 films , including " @entity42 " and " mission : impossible -- @entity48 " comprised seven of the top 10 highest - grossing films in 2012 , according to the @entity47			1
while foreign films accounted for only a quarter of the 303 movies screened in @entity3 theatres last year , they took in over half of overall ticket sales ( 52.4 % )			1
@entity3 moviegoers seek escapism , according to @entity32 , @entity3 's first female director to exceed rmb 100 million ( $ 16 million ) at the box office			1
she struck gold with her 2009 romantic comedy , " @entity60 , " which featured international @entity3 star @entity59			2
previously , @entity3 romantic comedies were primarily low - budget efforts that failed to capture audiences , she said			2
indeed , the highest - grossing film in @entity3 last year ( rmb 1 billion or $ 161 million ) was " lost in @entity66 , " a locally - produced lowbrow , slapstick comedy featuring two rival colleagues battling snakes and gangsters to win the favor of their boss			1
in contrast , @entity34 's " @entity75 , " a dark historical film dramatizing the transition between the @entity79 and @entity80 dynasties , felt flat when it was released in late november			0
" people struggle for [ the ] whole year , they want some entertainment , " he said			0
it is not to say that @entity3 audiences only welcome comedic fare			1
while it did not crack the top ten , " @entity87 , " a futuristic sci - fi movie by @entity40 writer - director @entity89 and starring @entity90 , was still a big hit both internationally and in @entity3 last year			1
its scenes in @entity95 aside , @entity87 's projections of the future mirrored the ongoing question of @entity3 's trajectory , said @entity28 , whose company co-produced the movie			0
" there 's never really been a film that has talked about mainland @entity3 in the future , and that i think is very , very specific to what @entity87 was , " @entity28 said			2
" it 's obviously a powerhouse ... but where is it going to be in the future ? " easy access to theaters is also driving mainland viewers to the silver screen			0
@entity3 has over 12,000 movie screens and it is adding more at a rate of eight to 10 each day , @entity28 said			2
cinemas in major cities like @entity116 and @entity95 are comparable to those in the @entity40 , @entity34 added			0
but the guests said the overriding factor in increasing box office sales is a growing predilection for young @entity3 to visit the cinema every week			1
" i know some young people , they go into movie theatres every week and sometimes if they like [ the movie ] , they watch [ it ] three times , " said @entity32			0
@entity3 's film boom is not without its obstaclesâ € ” particularly in navigating government censors			2
@entity34 described the process as opaque and protracted			0
for his critically - acclaimed film " @entity133 " about the controversial rape of @entity135 , he said censors took nearly a year to approve the script and half a year to approve the film			0
while censorship restrictions are all - encompassing on the surface , @entity28 said the rules are subject to interpretation for each film , describing the system as a @entity3 way of saying , " let me say what you ca n't do and we 'll work our way backwards			1
" " there 's a rule that says you ca n't do this and there 's a rule that says you ca n't do that , " he said , adding , " if we live by those rules , we would n't be anywhere , we would n't be in this business			0
" case in point : @entity87 managed to bypass the rule against featuring time travel by making other concessions			0
restrictions are slowly easing , @entity28 said , and " each new precedent will then lay the ground for the next one			1
" while @entity3 cinemas have a strict annual quota of screening 20 foreign films , the government allowed 14 extra films to be shown last year , as long as they were 3d or @entity177 versions			2
the share of revenue for foreign film companies was also increased to 25 %			0
filmmakers point out that opening up the mainland film industry is not only essential for foreign films to do well in @entity3 , but also for @entity3 films to break into international markets			1
there is clearly a mutual appetite between the @entity3 and @entity40 film industries			2
@entity191 chief @entity190 stopped by @entity192 on a @entity40 visit last year			0
@entity194 and @entity3 media groups are set to open a joint venture animation studio in @entity95 , as part of a new entertainment district billed as rivaling @entity199 in @entity200			0
" this is definitely the best time for the @entity3 filmmakers because there are so many investors with hot money ... we have so many opportunities , " said @entity32 .			0
