-- the number of women dying of pregnancy and childbirth - related complications has been cut nearly in half over the past two decades , reflecting important and hard - won gains in improving access to family planning and maternal health across the world			1
the annual number of maternal deaths worldwide dropped from more than 543,000 to 287,000 , according to a report , " trends in maternal mortality : 1990 - 2010 , " released last month by the @entity14 , the @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17			1
this is good news to celebrate wednesday , which is @entity22			0
from these latest estimates , we can see that investments in improving access to reproductive health are bearing fruit			0
although things are moving in the right direction , there is an urgent need to do more			0
every day , some 800 women die in pregnancy or childbirth from complications that are very often preventable , such as severe bleeding , infections , high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortion			1
for every woman who dies , a further 20 women suffer debilitating childbirth injuries , such as obstetric fistulas			2
as the lead @entity15 agency for sexual and reproductive health , we at @entity15 are working closely with the @entity15 secretary - general 's @entity48 and the @entity50 , every child initiative , which involves sister @entity15 agencies , governments , businesses and foundations in working toward saving the lives of 16 million women and children by 2015			2
we have the tools for preventing these tragedies			0
measures such as expanding access to voluntary family planning , investing in health workers with midwifery skills and ensuring access to emergency obstetric care when complications arise have been shown time and again to work			1
these interventions not only help save lives , but also support the healthy development of families , communities and nations			0
ninety - nine percent of maternal deaths happen in the developing world , where millions of women are still denied even the most basic levels of care during pregnancy			1
thirty - six of the 40 countries with the highest maternal death rates are in @entity85			1
in that region , the lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 39			0
in the @entity90 , it is 1 in 2,400			0
in @entity92 , it is 1 in 14,100			0
yet many countries have shown remarkable commitments to reversing these trends and ensuring that women have access to skilled health care during pregnancy and childbirth , regardless of where they live			1
ten countries so far , including @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , have already met the @entity108 target of reducing maternal deaths from 1990 levels by 75 % by 2015			1
another nine countries , including @entity112 and @entity113 , are on track for meeting their targets			0
in other regions , we already know what needs to be done			0
fortunately , the new data also show us where to target our efforts			0
two countries account for a full third of all maternal deaths : @entity125 with 56,000 deaths and @entity127 with 40,000 deaths			1
just 10 countries account for 60 % of all maternal deaths			1
expanding access to modern contraception for women across the developing world is another highly cost - effective measure that has proven results , and which could in itself reduce the numbers of maternal deaths by a third			1
in @entity85 , just 22 % of the women have access to modern contraception			1
in addition , there is a particular need for investment in health and education for the roughly 500 million adolescent girls who live in the developing world			1
many of them never have a chance to fulfill their potential , because they marry too young and become pregnant too early			0
all too often , they lack access to adequate health care during pregnancy and at the time of birth			2
as a result , 70,000 teenage girls die in pregnancy or childbirth each year , making maternal death the most common cause of death for girls between 15 and 19 years old			1
often , a high prevalence of maternal death reflects the low status of women in a society			2
with greater access to health and education , however , new generations of girls will be empowered to delay pregnancy , advance gender equality and contribute to the economic development of society			2
as educated mothers , they will be more likely to invest in the health and education of their children , thus empowering future generations as well			0
empowered young people , women and others can beat the poverty trap , propel national development and ensure a more sustainable future for the world			2
