for mobile users who text with friends via @entity4 , it 's almost time to download the social - media giant 's dedicated app for doing so , or lose the ability			1
@entity4 says that , for the next few days , it will be notifying people that if they want to continue sending mobile message , they 'll need to download the @entity11 app. " as we 've said , our goal is to focus development efforts on making @entity11 the best mobile messaging experience possible and avoid the confusion of having separate @entity4 mobile messaging experiences , " a @entity4 spokeswoman said tuesday in a written statement			1
" messenger is used by more than 200 million people every month , and we 'll keep working to make it an even more engaging way to connect with people			0
" in april , @entity4 announced the change was coming			2
it has been rolled out to @entity26 and @entity27 users in parts of @entity29 and elsewhere since then , and is now coming to the @entity30			0
in november , after @entity4 launched @entity32 , the company discontinued messaging in the core @entity4 app for people who already had @entity11			1
the good news for people still using just the @entity4 app is that they 'll be able to message friends in much the same way they do now			2
once both apps are installed , tapping the " message " icon on the @entity4 app will simply send the user to @entity11			1
they 'll be able to return via a " return to @entity4 " icon			0
the popularity of apps like @entity11 and @entity49 , which @entity4 purchased in february , are helping change the rules for texting			2
wireless plans that charge for texting are becoming a thing of the past in the @entity30 , though they remain the norm in places like @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , where @entity49 has become a popular , nearly free alternative			0
what to know about @entity4 opinion : did @entity4 's experiment violate ethics ? @entity4 is cutting back on spammy auto - posts			0
