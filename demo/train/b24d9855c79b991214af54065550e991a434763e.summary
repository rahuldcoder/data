the core of @entity2 's story has been told again and again in recent days -- about how the 17 - year - old went out to a @entity4 , @entity5 , convenience store , only to be killed on his way back to his father 's fiance 's home			1
yet one month later , questions persist as to exactly how and why that happened			0
the man who admitted shooting the teen has not been charged in connection to the case , much to the dismay of @entity2 's parents and thousands of strangers nationwide who 've rallied behind them			1
on monday , the story continued to gain both complexity , and clarity , thanks to details of the account that @entity2 's shooter gave to police after the shooting			1
@entity31 's description is outlined in an @entity33 article that cited " authorities " as the source of its information			2
the @entity37 subsequently released a statement that , while condemning what it called " unauthorized leaks , " confirmed the newspaper account " is consistent with the information provided to the state attorney 's office by the police department			2
" events held around country in response to case @entity31 , a 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer , told police he was on his way to the grocery store when he saw @entity2 , a black male , walking through his gated community , according to the @entity33 report			1
" something 's wrong with him , " he told a 911 dispatcher , according to the contents of a call released last week			2
he 's coming to check me out			0
he 's got something in his hands			0
" the teen started to run , @entity31 said			2
when he said he was following the boy , the dispatcher told him , " we do n't need you to do that			0
" shortly afterward , neighbors began calling 911 to report an apparent altercation , then a gunshot			0
the @entity33 report fills in some blanks , purportedly from @entity31 's perspective , of what transpired in the meantime			1
@entity31 , according to the @entity33 report , later told police that he lost sight of @entity2 and was returning to his suv when the teen approached him			1
the two exchanged words , according to @entity31 , who said @entity2 then punched him in the nose			1
on the ground , @entity31 said he was repeatedly punched and had his head slammed into the sidewalk , according to the @entity33 report			2
he began yelling , he told police			1
previously released tapes of 911 calls included neighbors saying they had heard hearing screams -- though it was n't clear whether they came from @entity31 or @entity2			1
@entity93 told @entity94 on monday that she and @entity95 were in a kitchen nearby when they " heard a whining , someone in distress , and then the gunshot			0
" they ran outside and , " within seconds , " were about 10 feet away from @entity2 's body , @entity95 said			1
" ( @entity31 ) was standing over the body , basically straddling the body with his hand on @entity2 's back , " said @entity93 , adding that they called three times to him before he finally asked them to call police			1
" it did n't seem to me that he was trying to help him in any way			0
" and @entity2 's girlfriend was on the phone with him prior to the shooting , according to a lawyer for the shooting victim 's family			1
@entity123 said last week that the girl " completely blows @entity31 's absurd self - defense claim out of the water			1
" what is evident is that , minutes after that @entity31 's first 911 call , police arrived at the scene			1
they found @entity2 " laying face down in the grass , " according to a police report			1
a short time later , @entity2 was pronounced dead			2
as to @entity31 , " his back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass ( and he ) was also bleeding , from the nose and back of his head , " according to the same report			2
@entity31 was questioned , but has not been charged in the case			2
this fact has triggered widespread uproar , with nearly three - fourths of @entity143 -- including 67 percent of whites and 86 percent of non-whites -- believing he should be arrested , according to a @entity94 / @entity147 poll released monday			0
majority in poll call for shooter 's arrest those attitudes were on display in more than dozen cities monday			0
many demonstrators wore hooded sweatshirts and carried @entity157 candy -- just like @entity2 had , on the night he was killed -- from @entity158 to @entity159 in many communities , big and small , in between to show support for the victim 's family and denounce racism , profiling and laws that permit use of force in self - defense			1
in the central @entity5 city of @entity4 , a regularly scheduled city commission meeting turned into a forum focused on the @entity2 case			2
near its start , rev. @entity174 presented a petition that he said had been signed by 2 million people calling for @entity31 's arrest			2
he was one of several speakers who called for answers and accountability for police officers who they felt bungled the case by not testing @entity31 for alcohol and drug levels and not doing a background check on him -- even though they did both for the victim			2
" the @entity4 police department needs to be held accountable , " said an emotional @entity190 , @entity2 's father			1
@entity2 's family and supporters have said that they believe race played a role in the shooting			1
@entity31 is a white @entity197			2
his family says he has been mistakenly portrayed as racist			0
on monday , @entity2 's supporters continued to insist that @entity31 should be held responsible for @entity2 's death -- saying the teen would be alive today if @entity31 had simply followed the 911 dispatcher 's instructions , to stay away			1
" we 're dealing with a self - appointed watchdog who disobeyed the dispatcher 's instructions that he agreed to , " said @entity174 , during a press conference earlier monday with @entity2 's parents in @entity4			1
" all else is irrelevant			0
" that includes , he added , reports that first surfaced monday in media accounts and later confirmed by a family spokesman that @entity2 had been suspended after a search of his book bag turned up an empty plastic bag with marijuana residue			2
@entity2 , who lived in @entity218 , was visiting @entity4 after receiving a 10 - day suspension from school , according to a family spokesman			1

" the only comment that i have right now is that they 've killed my son and now they 're trying to kill his reputation , " @entity2 's mother , @entity225 , said at a news conference			1

an attorney for the @entity2 family said monday that any jury that sees the evidence in the case -- much of which she said was collected by investigators working on the @entity2 family 's behalf -- would convict @entity31			1
