-- @entity1 appears to be dead			1
but the battle over internet piracy is not			2
in the wake of the debate over the @entity1 , supporters of that now - abandoned bill are looking to internet service providers for help ; they 're also taking other tacks that web - freedom advocates say could have much the same effect as @entity1 would have had			1
that bill , which came before the @entity13 earlier this year , would have made it easier to shut down websites that illegally share music , movies and other content			0
opponents of @entity1 , which included tech heavyweights such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , argued it was too broad and could effectively stifle expression online			1
remember the @entity23 blackout ? it was in protest of @entity1			1
but the entire time , internet service providers , at the behest of trade groups representing the entertainment industry , have been preparing to police such illegal sharing voluntarily and , potentially , shut down sites they think are n't playing by the rules			1
those actions could have the same effect that @entity1 would have			2
according to a leading recording industry spokesman , service providers such as @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 are expected to begin enforcing ramped - up anti-piracy policies in the next few months			1
( @entity44 , @entity0 's parent company , supported the legislation			0
@entity44 is no longer affiliated with the company			0
) " each @entity53 has to develop their infrastructure for automating the system , " @entity49 , ceo of the @entity50 , said this week at a publishers conference in @entity52			0
" every @entity53 has to do it differently , depending on the architecture of its particular network			0
some are nearing completion , and others are a little further from completion			0
" the @entity64 , which the recording industry 's trade group first announced in july , has alternately been called a " gradual elevation " approach or the " six strikes " plan because of the warnings that providers would give before curbing a user 's internet access			1
unlike @entity1 , it targets individual web users , not websites			2
after five or six alerts that their account appears to have been used to download content illegally , the @entity53 could take measures including temporarily throttling ( i.e. dramatically slowing down ) internet speed , redirecting users to a web page asking them to contact their provider or other measures			2
supporters said they expect most web users will stop downloading copyrighted material once they realize it 's not legal			0
" we hope that effort -- designed to notify and educate customers , not to penalize them -- will set a reasonable standard for both copyright owners and @entity53 to follow , while informing customers about copyright laws and encouraging them to get content from the many legal sources that exist , " @entity90 , executive vice president of @entity41 , said in a statement when the plan was made public last year			0
web - freedom advocates acknowledge the plan would n't go as far as @entity1 , which called for offending websites to be shut down in some cases			1
but they still have concerns			0
@entity105 , an attorney with the @entity106 , said it 's unclear how severe penalties could be for users who are repeatedly warned under the system			0
the announcement listed examples but made it clear that other means could be used			0
most dangerously , he said , the system calls on service providers to act based on accusations or appearances , not proven facts			1
" a court has n't spoken , " he said			0
" it sort of puts the @entity53 in the position of being a judge			0
" no bill is ever truly dead in @entity13 , but there have n't been any visible efforts to push similar legislation since a public outcry over @entity1 led sponsors to shelve the effort in january			2
" it is a lot more quiet , and i would guess it 's because it 's an election year , " @entity105 said			0
" i think they realize this sort of thing can be an election liability now			0
" but that has n't stopped anti-piracy proponents from heading to other fronts , including overseas , to continue the fight			2
@entity145 chairman @entity144 , a former @entity146 senator , spoke last week in @entity147 , where the movie business is huge and is expected to become a $ 5 billion - a - year industry in the near future			1
" content theft is a global problem , and we must have a global commitment to solving it , " @entity144 said during a film - industry conference in @entity152			0
" this is an important opportunity for the @entity147 government to move forward with strong protections against online theft			2
we encourage the @entity147 film industry to reject as we have , the false argument that you can not be pro-technology and pro-copyright at the same time			1
" @entity144 's speech came at nearly the same time that an @entity147 court was ordering all internet service providers in the country to block 104 websites it said offered illegal music downloads			1
according to @entity171 , a blog specializing in news about file - sharing sites and the legal issues they face , @entity147 already has @entity1 - style legislation in place that allows judges to make such orders			1
all the while , the @entity179 , a treaty designed to define intellectual property rights and enforcement internationally , is moving along , gaining support from many of the world 's wealthiest and most influential nations			1
the @entity146 , the @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and others have already endorsed the deal			2
" few people have heard of @entity179 , or the @entity179 , but the provisions in the agreement appear quite similar to -- and more expansive than -- anything we saw in @entity1 , " blogger @entity198 , who is critical of the plan , wrote for @entity200			1
" worse , the agreement spans virtually all of the countries in the developed world , including all of the @entity188 , the @entity146 , @entity205 and @entity189			1
" opponents said it 's not clear how the agreement would affect laws in the @entity146 and elsewhere , while backers said its intent is merely to codify and reinforce existing laws , making them easier to enforce			1
the treaty is open to all @entity214 to sign until may 2013			0
it would then need to be ratified by legislative bodies in at least six of the participating nations .			0

with @entity1 *stalled* in @entity146 , anti-piracy advocates have taken the fight elsewhere
internet service providers are planning to enforce " six strikes " rule on illegal downloads
the motion picture industry is urging other nations , such as @entity147 , to act
meanwhile , @entity179 , an international treaty , is moving along in major countries
