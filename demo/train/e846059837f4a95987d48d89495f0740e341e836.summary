with all of the fake sharks flying around tv lately , some viewers wish the @entity3 would stick just to the facts			1
on sunday , the network kicked off its popular predator - infested extravaganza , @entity8 , with the premiere of a dramatized special that explores the existence of prehistoric sharks called megalodons			1
@entity3 billed the special , " @entity14 : @entity15 , " as taking viewers " on a search for a massive killer great white shark responsible for a rash of fatalities off the coast of @entity23			1
" viewers were expecting to watch shark experts and scientists examine evidence that the massive creatures could still be swimming around somewhere			1
the only problem is that , as @entity31 notes , the megalodon has been extinct for millions of years , and viewers have complained they were n't presented with any evidence to the contrary			2
" dear discovery channel , your fake documentary that you are trying to pass off as reality is upsetting , " tweeted one viewer			0
" the director of blair witch just tweeted that the # megalodon show is the worst thing he has seen since the blair witch project , " said another			2
@entity46 , a doctoral student studying shark ecology and conservation at the @entity50 's @entity49 , told @entity31 that he would n't expect this kind of programming from @entity3			1
" if this megalodon special had aired on the @entity54 , i probably would have loved it , " he said			2
" but @entity3 bills itself as the premier science education television station in the world , and they 're perpetuating this utter nonsense			0
" the executive producer of @entity8 , @entity61 , points out that @entity3 aired three disclaimers for " @entity14 , " including that " none of the institutions or agencies that appear in the film are affiliated with it in any way , nor have approved its contents			0
" additionally , the network warned that " certain events and characters in this film have been dramatized , " and that " legends of giant sharks persist all over the world ; there is still debate about what they may be			0
" it seems the point of " @entity14 " was to raise questions more than present answers			0
" with a whole week of @entity8 programming ahead of us , we wanted to explore the possibilities of @entity14 , " @entity61 said			0
" it 's one of the most debated shark discussions of all time , ' can @entity14 exist today ? ' it 's ( the ) ultimate @entity8 fantasy			1
the stories have been out there for years and with 95 percent of the ocean unexplored , who really knows ? " it 's clear that tv audiences are interested in finding out			0
the " @entity14 " show brought in record ratings for @entity3 , with 4.8 million viewers tuning in			1
in the 26 - year history of @entity8 , " @entity14 " is the highest - rated and most - watched @entity8 episode to date .			0

the @entity3 is facing *criticism* for a shark week special
it explored whether the prehistoric megalodon could still exist today
*disgruntled* viewers poked *fun* at the show online
however , the special also brought in record ratings
