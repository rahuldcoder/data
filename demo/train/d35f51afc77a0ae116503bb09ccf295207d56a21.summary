another @entity1 storm is expected to pound the @entity2 this weekend and could unleash flash flooding , mudslides and debris flows , just a week after similar rains left widespread devastation			1
flood watches and winter weather advisories now exist throughout @entity11 and @entity10 , and a coastal flood advisory will continue through monday for the @entity13 , the @entity14 said saturday			1
in all , a moisture plume from the @entity16 across the @entity1 could drop between 4 and 6 inches of rain on the coast and as much as 8 inches in @entity11			1
the @entity19 could receive 6 to 10 inches of new snow , and northern @entity21 could experience 3 inches of rain " these disturbances , along with their surface cold fronts , are forecast to bring heavy rain for the coastal areas of the @entity27 , with some amounts in excess of 4 inches possible by @entity30 , " the @entity14 said			1
" very heavy snow in the higher mountain ranges could reach 1 to 3 feet with copious moisture being forced up the topography			0
" as the @entity2 front energizes climates across the country , rain and cold could create delays in holiday travel from tuesday through wednesday in the @entity44 , the @entity45 and the @entity48 's @entity47 corridor , @entity36 forecasters said			1
a @entity50 storm could strike the @entity52 basin from @entity53 to @entity54 to @entity55 , delivering snow showers and freezing temperatures			0
the storm would taper off by @entity59 , said @entity36 meteorologist @entity60			0
landslide anxieties more than a week ago , storms pummeled the @entity63 , killing two people in @entity11 when trees fell , knocking homes into the sea in @entity10 , burying houses in a @entity21 rockslide and even spawning a rare tornado in @entity71			2
power outages struck hundreds of thousands of customers			0
the weekend warnings of debris flows conjure up a tragedy in march , when a landslide killed more than 40 people in @entity79 , @entity10 , about 60 miles northeast of @entity80			0
@entity11 geologists also expressed concern , especially in areas hit earlier by this year 's wildfires			2
" landslides will be a reality in future major flood events , " @entity85 , engineering geologist with the @entity86 , told @entity36 affiliate @entity87			0
" and because @entity11 's population is growing , more people , places and property may be at risk			1
" holiday travel the forecast promised a rocky start to next week 's @entity50 holiday and was immediately posing problems for early holiday travel			1
" there 's such a headwind that i 'm getting terrible gas mileage today , " @entity103 told @entity36 affiliate @entity104			0
she drove from @entity108 , @entity21 , on friday to visit her son in @entity110			0
one upside for travel , though , has been low gasoline prices			1
the national average on saturday was $ 2.43 a gallon , the lowest level in five years and 70 cents lower than last year , @entity114 said			2
that price could fall as low as $ 2.25 by @entity119 , @entity114 said			2
at those prices , @entity114 is projecting 98.6 million @entity121 will travel 50 miles or more from home during the year - end holidays , an increase of 4 % over last year			1
" lower gas prices are filling stockings with a little more cash to spend on travel this year as travelers are expected to pay the lowest prices since 2009 , " said @entity125 , @entity114 president and chief operating officer			1
@entity133 told @entity104 that such prices were one reason he chose to drive rather than fly his family from @entity137 , @entity11 , to @entity138 , @entity21			2
" i found the tickets			0
but it was like $ 1,500 for four people			0
so i said , ' eh , i can go back and forth with the gas in my car , ' " @entity133 said .			0
