-- for nearly 30 years , one man has dominated @entity2			2
@entity3 , 82 , has survived would - be assassins and ill health , crushed a rising @entity7 radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring @entity9 that got his predecessor killed			1
his government 's continued observance of the @entity14 accords with @entity9 is the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades - long @entity19 - @entity9 conflict			1
following the revolt that toppled @entity22 's longtime strongman , demonstrators in the streets of @entity25 are standing up to riot police and chanting , " @entity3 , @entity27 is waiting for you			1
" experienced observers say it 's the most most significant challenge to his rule yet			1
it 's far from clear , however , that the demonstrators have the support or the coordination to bring down the man critics have called @entity2 's last pharaoh			2
" he 's been in power a very long time , and he is very wily , " said @entity39 , a @entity40 historian at the @entity41			1
" he 's developed all kinds of techiniques for dealing with opponents that have proven relatively successful			2
" but longtime observers of the region say the stability @entity3 has purchased has come at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the @entity19 world 's most populous nation			1
" @entity2 is a broken country , " @entity56 , a professor of @entity40 relations at the @entity58 , told @entity0			0
" it used to be the jewel of the @entity40			0
it 's the capital of its cultural production			2
" but now , @entity56 said , " @entity2 have no outlets			0
they do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future			0
" @entity3 was a @entity68 - trained pilot who was chief of staff of @entity2 's air force during the 1973 @entity40 war			1
the early success of @entity2 pilots against @entity9 made him a national hero , and then - president @entity75 made him vice president in 1975			2
six years later , @entity75 died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade , killed by @entity81 militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with @entity9			2
upon assuming office , one of @entity3 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that allowed barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely			1
he has made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades			0
the @entity2 army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986 , and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists			0
" he pretty much wiped them out , " @entity39 said			0
" it 's not an accident that they were in @entity109 instead of @entity2			2
" and the government has also penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that " if five people sit down to plot something , the fifth person writes a report to @entity3 about it , " he said			1
the result is " a regime that has very little legitimacy , but presents itself as something there 's no point in trying to change , " said @entity122 , a professor of @entity40 politics at @entity124 in @entity125			2
but @entity122 said the january 14 overthrow of @entity22 president @entity128 @entity127 , who fled to @entity27 after 23 years in power , has changed the thinking of many in the region			1
" i think what the events in @entity22 did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it , " he said			1
@entity3 has headed off a similar movement before , in 2005 , when @entity2 mounted large - scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform			1
he intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated @entity142 , harassed middle - class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests , @entity122 said			2
but the current movement " has no real leadership , so it ca n't be decapitated the same way , " he said			0
" if @entity3 decided tomorrow , ' i 'll sit down and engage with you , ' it 's not clear who that ' you ' is			1
" @entity3 won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities			1
his fifth , in 2005 , was @entity2 's first multi-party presidential vote , but it was widely criticized as a " sham , " @entity39 said			2
meanwhile , the country 's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule			1
development has picked up in the past decade , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but its gains have been " very unevenly distributed			2
" about 40 percent of @entity2 currently live in poverty , @entity56 said			0
the aging autocrat has escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in 1995 when @entity81 militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-african conference in @entity174			0
and in recent years , he has had several bouts of illness but has never picked a vice president			0
he is widely believed to have anointed his son @entity178 as his successor , but no formal announcement has been made			0
in 2003 , he collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the @entity2 parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu			0
he had back surgery in @entity186 in 2004 , returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed			0
he has largely withdrawn from public view in recent years and has not addressed his country during the current crisis , @entity122 said			0
his situation is being closely watched overseas , particularly in the @entity192			0
in the past decade , @entity2 has been major player in @entity9 - @entity195 peace talks , and it contributed troops to the @entity192 - led coalition that drove @entity198 out of @entity199 in 1991			0
it gets about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from @entity125 every year , second only to @entity9 , and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to @entity203 figures			1
but it opposed the @entity192 invasion of @entity198 in 2003 -- and while sticking with @entity14 , @entity2 's ties with @entity9 amount to a " cold peace , " @entity39 said			0
president @entity207 noted thursday that @entity3 has been " very helpful on a range of tough issues , " but he said he has pushed the @entity2 leader to take steps toward reform			1
" you can see these pent - up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets , " @entity207 said			0
he urged the @entity2 government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the demonstrations , adding , " i think it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances			1
" @entity122 said @entity3 probably has to endorse some political form to survive			1
but he will have to do it " extremely carefully , so it 's not seen as a desperate measure of last resort			0
" @entity39 said @entity3 could bow to one of the protesters ' demands and lift the state of emergency			1
" @entity2 does have a fairly liberal constitution and it does enshrine a lot of rights in it , " he said			0
" but it 's just a piece of paper			0
it 's sidestepped by the emergency			1
" if lifted , " the judges and the courts in @entity2 are very feisty , and they will take on the government			0
" he could also hold a free and fair presidential election this year , " but it 's asking a lot , " @entity39 said			1
but @entity56 said the @entity40 has seen " the barrier of fear " removed since the events in @entity22			1
" arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus , regardless of whether @entity3 remains or goes , " he said			2
" we 're going to have a new era of politics			0

@entity3 has held power since 1981
a 30 - year state of emergency has aided his rule
he now faces widespread demonstrations after @entity22 's revolt
the uprising removed the " barrier of fear , " one *analyst* says
