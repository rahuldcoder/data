-- " oh , look at all the swans , " she said			2
i was driving my daughter to her boyfriend 's house			2
about 20 mute swans were floating in the shallows near the shore of @entity10 in the @entity11			1
i wondered whether , in all good conscience , i should ruin my daughter 's swan swoon			2
" take a good look at them , " i said , " because the state plans to exterminate them			1
" " what ? " she looked stricken			0
" all the swans in the whole bay ? " " all the mute swans in the whole state , " i said			1
" why ? " she demanded			0
" they 're my favorite bird			2
" " the reason is , they 're not native			1
and they eat a lot of vegetation			0
and they 're territorial , so they give some native ducks and geese a hard time			1
also , during breeding season , they hiss and bluff , and that scares some people			0
" " those are stupid reasons , " she said , demanding to know who is planning to kill them			0
i told her it 's the @entity48			2
" you ca n't be serious			0
the department of conservation is going to kill all of my favorite birds ? " she was silent for a moment and then brightened and asked , " are you fooling me ? " " not fooling			0
why are they your favorite ? " " well , because , i mean , they 're monogamous -- " lots of birds , actually , are monogamous			2
and lots of monogamous birds color outside the lines			0
i kept silent , like the mute swans , on this point			1
we were , after all , going to her boyfriend 's house , and monogamy is something i support			2
" -- and they 're , y'know , i mean look at how graceful they look out there			2
and , like , they start out ugly and then grow up to be so beautiful			2
it 's the whole ugly duckling thing			2
i mean , i do n't have any substantial reasons ; they 're just my favorite			0
" i have favorite birds too , and i do n't have any better reasons for why my favorites are my favorites			0
@entity82 kept staring at the swans			0
" you should write something about this , " she said			0
" i should do a lot of things , " i reminded both of us			0
i kind of agree with the department 's main reason for exterminating @entity94 's resident mute swans ( by the way , that 's the species ' name , because they 're usually silent )			1
non-native species often pose problems			0
i just have two problems with the plan			0
@entity102 , i do n't think mute swans are really too much of a threat to anything or anyone in @entity94			1
they live mainly on @entity11 and the lower @entity108 , with a few on the @entity110			0
they number just around 2,200 birds , total , in the whole state			0
the state says that mute swans are a problem for native waterfowl			1
i see native waterfowl , and their ducklings and goslings , on many of the same ponds where i see swans			1
native waterfowl , by the way , that the state permits hunters to kill			1
here 's what hunters in @entity94 are allowed : " the daily limit of 6 ducks includes all species of mergansers , and may include 4 mallards ( no more than 2 of which may be hens ) , 1 black duck , 3 wood ducks , 2 pintail , 2 redheads , 2 scaup , 2 canvasback , 4 scoters or 2 hooded mergansers			1
" i 'd like to know whether any mute swans kill six ducks per day or even per year			1
@entity147 swans have no direct interactions with most sea ducks -- i do n't even think they compete for food -- but hunters have a " daily limit of 7 sea ducks ( scoters , eiders and long - tailed ducks ) in addition to the regular duck bag in coastal waters of the @entity161 only			1
" note italics in the state regulations : hunters may kill extra sea ducks only if they happen to be hunting in the part of the state where the sea is			1
so who and what is the greater problem ? and is there really a problem ? @entity147 swans are territorial , and as near as i can tell , their own territoriality seems , in my casual observations , self - limiting			1
on the ponds i know , there 's usually just one nesting pair			0
i think they themselves keep it that way by preventing other swans from nesting			0
the state claims that their numbers are increasing			0
assuming that 's true , and assuming that 's a problem , why not reduce their numbers by letting hunters shoot the swans that are purportedly causing the problem for native ducks , instead of shooting native ducks ? i know , of course , that such logic is dead on arrival , but i 'm just sayin '			1
so around @entity11 where mute swans are such a problem for ducks , the lucky hunter can kill a baker 's dozen of ducks daily			1
i am getting a mental image of a lineup of people who 've killed too many ducks , with a mute swan standing among them			1
hmm ; who 's the culprit ? by the way , sea ducks taste terrible to most people , and i 've seen hunters kill them , collect them and throw them in the bushes			1
often , they just shoot them and let them drift away on the tide			0
but to hear the state 's explanation , you 'd think that the problem for ducks is : mute swans			1
the only other problem i have with the plan to exterminate the swans is , that is a very stupid idea			1
i mean that in the most supportive sense of the word , " stupid			0
" for a public agency that needs public trust and support to attack birds with which people feel a symbolic bond is unwise			2
here 's what i learned a long time ago by watching a venerable old conservation organization tear itself in half over an attempt to replace its much - loved generations - old logo : never attack symbols unless you 're sure you are right , you know you can win and you do n't care about creating permanent enmity and resentment and alienating a lot of people			1
the reason mute swans were brought here from @entity30 is , people really like them			1
people like them because they look beautiful , and they look beautiful because people can actually see them			0
we are surrounded by literally hundreds of species of native birds , many of them absolutely stunning , that people ca n't see because they are too hidden , too small , you need binoculars , they 're in the treetops or you have to get out of your car			2
" to speak truly , " @entity265 wrote , " few adult persons can see nature			0
most persons do not see the sun. " for them , there 's mute swans			1
non-native animals are often a terrible problem for native wildlife			2
but not always ( honey bees come to mind )			0
there 's little that can be done about zebra mussels , starlings , @entity282 barberry and most invasive aliens			0
yet before we exterminate the ones we can truly bully , let 's be sure they 're really a problem			1
and let 's be sure that utter extermination is really the best goal			0
or else , like the mute swan itself , let us hold our peace			0

@entity94 's state *environmental* agency drafted a plan to exterminate mute swans
@entity306 : if swans are problem for native ducks , let hunters shoot them
he says mute swans are not a serious threat ; they 're symbolic , beautiful and well - liked
@entity306 : exterminating the swans is a dumb idea ; you can voice your opinion to the state
