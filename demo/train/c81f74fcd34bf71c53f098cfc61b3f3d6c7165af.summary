-- the investigative journalist facing trial after embarrassing @entity4 's political and business elite by publishing the names of 2,000 @entity4 with @entity7 bank accounts on monday stuck to his guns saying his list showed " how sick the system is "			1
speaking from his office in a run - down shopping mall in central @entity14 , @entity11 claimed the list of accounts held by @entity4 at an @entity18 branch in @entity19 encapsulated @entity4 's deeply corrupt political culture			1
" it is a closed system with politicians , businessmen and their hangers - on controlling what happens , " he told the @entity0 as the lights flickered on and off			2
" we acted in the public interest ... we know the list is accurate			2
it refers both to legitimate accounts held by businesspeople and individuals and to others that we believe were used for channeling funds for purposes of tax evasion			2
" an @entity14 court postponed until thursday @entity11 's trial for allegedly violating the country 's data protection laws			1
the journalist 's lawyers requested the delay at a preliminary hearing on monday so that he could prepare his defence			2
scores of friends and colleagues gathered outside the court to show support for @entity11 , editor of the biweekly @entity53 magazine			1
if convicted , he faces up to five years ' imprisonment			0
" we will argue that there was no violation of privacy under @entity4 law as we did n't publish the amounts held in each account , only the names and professions of the account - holders , " @entity11 said			1
@entity11 said that more than â ‚ ¬ 13bn had moved through the accounts on the list between 1998 and 2007 : " our view is that some account - holders moved large amounts of black money through their @entity18 account in @entity19 to invest in foreign funds or deposit in safe havens elsewhere			1
" the conservative - led coalition government has not commented on the case			0
one government official said on monday it was " being handled by the @entity4 justice system , and it has to be cleared up "			0
shipowners , industrialists , artists and a handful of politicians and their relatives are among those named in the so - called " @entity88 " published last week by @entity89 of last week 's issue quadrupled to 100,000 , highlighting @entity4 anger over the failure of successive governments to crack down on tax evasion by the country 's elite			1
the full list was also published as a special insert in monday 's edition of @entity100 , @entity4 's biggest selling daily newspaper			1
@entity53 's publication of the list provided in 2010 by @entity103 , then @entity104 finance minister , to her @entity4 counterpart for investigation of possible tax evasion , has sent shockwaves through the country 's political and business elite			1
although members of the @entity4 establishment have long been known to transfer funds abroad , often in the names of their wives and other family members , it is the first time that large numbers of such account - holders have been publicly identified			0
the list was officially revealed last month though unofficial versions had circulated for more than two years			2
" our understanding is that politicians , media barons and some journalists were able to exploit the list for blackmail and extortion because the government held off from launching a proper investigation , " @entity11 said , as a power outage briefly plunged his office into darkness			1
several political figures whose names appeared on the list have issued formal denials			2
@entity138 , a former public order minister , called it a fake , saying he and his family did not have any bank accounts outside @entity4			0
@entity143 , brother of former premier @entity144 , said there were plenty of other @entity4 with the same name			0
former finance minister @entity148 said the appearance of his wife 's name on the list did not correspond with reality			1
the @entity104 government obtained the list from @entity156 , a former @entity18 employee who had illegally copied detail of 20,000 account - holders , including @entity104 , @entity159 and @entity160 as well as @entity4 citizens			0
former finance minister @entity162 , who requested the list from mrs @entity103 , and his successor @entity164 face criticism for failing to ensure the financial police fully investigated the case			0
both politicians told parliament last week that the cd containing the names and a copy made on a usb stick had been mislaid			0
mr @entity164 later turned over a copy on a usb stick to the finance ministry , but @entity4 has since requested an official copy of the list from the @entity104 government because of doubts about its authenticity			0
@entity182 head of the financial police in 2010 told a public prosecutor he never received specific instructions to carry out a full investigation			0
@entity187 , his successor and a former public prosecutor , argued there were legal obstacles to pursuing the case			0
mr @entity162 said the records dated from 2007 and the total amount held by account - holders at that time stood at â ‚ ¬ 1.5bn			1
