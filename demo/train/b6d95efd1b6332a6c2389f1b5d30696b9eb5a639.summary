-- a leading figure in @entity4 president @entity3 's party , the @entity2 , has dismissed any suggestion that @entity7 chief @entity6 was set up when he was arrested on charges of sexual assault in @entity10 in may			1
" to imagine that what would have happened to mr. @entity6 would be the object of some sort of complicity from the @entity2 , it seems too hard to believe , " said @entity11 , secretary - general of the @entity2 party			1
charges against @entity6 were dropped in august after questions were raised over the credibility of his accuser , hotel maid @entity21			1
however , the scandal ended both his career at the @entity7 and any hope of the leading @entity26 politician challenging @entity3 in next year 's presidential election			1
now an article in the @entity29 says @entity6 suspected a cellphone that disappeared just before his arrest had earlier been hacked			1
it also describes @entity34 footage showing employees of the @entity37 hotel appearing to celebrate after the maid reported the alleged attack			0
a female friend of @entity6 allegedly warned him that an email he had sent had been read at @entity2 offices in @entity43			2
if this was the case it meant , according to the @entity29 , " he had reason to suspect he might be under electronic surveillance in @entity10			2
he had already been warned by a friend in the @entity4 diplomatic corps that an effort would be made to embarrass him with a scandal			1
the warning that his @entity53 might have been hacked was therefore all the more alarming			0
" the author of the @entity29 story , @entity56 , told @entity57 : " i did n't say it was a political conspiracy but i would say that people wanted to find evidence of an indiscretion of his that could derail either his ( @entity4 presidential ) candidacy or even ( his work at ) the @entity7			1
" one of @entity6 's lawyers , @entity68 , also told the news agency his client was possibly " the target of a deliberate effort to destroy him as a political force			1
" however , @entity68 did not say exactly who might be to blame			0
in @entity4 , right - wing politicians described the entire story as pure fantasy			2
" for me , if there are facts , if there is clear evidence , of course , it goes without saying that conclusions will have to be drawn , " said the @entity2 's @entity11			0
" as long as they are only rumors , gossip , allegations on the basis of anonymous testimony , which we know absolutely nothing about , you can understand that we remain a little more reserved and certainly not fooled			0
" in a television interview following his return to @entity43 , @entity6 confessed to a " moral weakness " and an " inappropriate relationship " with @entity21 , but denied any violence or aggression			2
@entity6 still faces a civil suit from @entity21 in @entity10 , but he has asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit , arguing his job gave him immunity from civil cases			1
the @entity10 hotel where the alleged incident was reported also dismissed the story as " inaccurate and speculative			0
" the @entity37 hotel chain released a statement saying : " the article states that two @entity37 employees were seen ' celebrating ' on tape for three minutes			0
in fact , the incident in question lasted only eight seconds and both employees categorically deny this exchange had anything to do with mr. @entity6			0
" @entity119 has cooperated with law enforcement authorities for the entirety of this case as was its civic and legal obligation			0
as the civil trial remains pending in the @entity125 , it would not be appropriate to comment on the facts of the case			0

*ex-imf* chief arrested on charges of sexual assault in @entity10 ; charges dropped
scandal ended his career at @entity7 and political *ambitions* in @entity4
@entity6 's lawyer says his client possibly " target of a deliberate effort to destroy him "
