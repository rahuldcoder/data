gov. - elect @entity14 , a @entity15 who takes office january 19 , has said he opposes the bill			1

to qualify under the bill , @entity3 high school graduates who are illegal immigrants must be enrolled at a public university or college and file an affidavit with the institution stating that they have applied for legal immigration status or will do so when eligible			1
if signed into law , the bill would be the 11th of its kind			0
there are similar laws in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			0
in 2008 , @entity42 ended its support for in - state tuition for students who are in the @entity49 illegally			1
@entity3 assemblyman @entity50 , a @entity15 , said the bill discriminates against @entity49 citizens who attend @entity3 colleges and universities but do n't live in the state			1
@entity50 believes illegal immigrants do not have the right to a reduced tuition			1
" you can call it undocumented , you can call it whatever you want			0
but you are not legal and you are not entitled , " @entity50 said			2
assemblywoman @entity61 , a @entity62 , expressed frustration with misconceptions of the bill that label it as a " free ride " or " state - funded " education			0
" these students have been here for decades , have gone through the school system here and should pay the same as their counterparts who have gone through school with them , " she said			1

" the undocumented kids have a tough time anyway			0
they 're really good about going to class , " @entity76 said			0
" then they stop because they ca n't afford to go to a four - year institution			0
" the @entity3 @entity86 said the bill would not affect state revenue because the state does not collect revenue from public colleges and universities			0
it is estimated that the bill 's provisions would increase the number of illegal immigrants applying for admission			2
assemblyman @entity99 , a @entity15 , questioned the validity of a bill that improves illegal immigrants ' access to education when their illegal status prohibits them from giving back to the state in a meaningful way			1
however , proponents of the bill believe that the young students will be resources for the state			2
@entity5 say that the backlog in applications for citizenship is the real culprit and that the controversy highlights the need for immigration reform on a national level			1

" @entity3 could be the tipping point in terms of energizing @entity126 to put immigration reform higher on the agenda , " he said			0
@entity120 cited a lack of legislative activity regarding in - state tuition for illegal immigrants in the past few years and applauded the @entity3 legislature			2
the legislation is the path to a more rational policy on education and immigration on a federal level , he said			0
" these men and women are not going back to their native homeland by and large ; they will be staying in @entity3 and the @entity49 the question is : do we want to facilitate their education and professional aspirations so they can contribute civically and economically , or do we want to prevent that ? " @entity120 said			1
" they may very well become a liability			0
" @entity50 had blunt words for immigrants whose illegal status he felt nullified their right to education , " go back home , apply , come legally , and i 'll welcome you with open arms			1
" however , students who have lived illegally with their families in the @entity49 see the opportunities the bill would give them			1
one such student -- @entity164 , who would only give her first name -- has been praised by teachers for her high grades			0
" this bill would just make our school dream possible			0
they 're not giving it to us for free , " said @entity164 , who is now a @entity49 citizen			1
" if they open up this channel for us , we 'll do the rest			2

@entity5 backer : students " should pay the same as their counterparts "
@entity15 critic : @entity183 discriminates against some @entity49 citizens
