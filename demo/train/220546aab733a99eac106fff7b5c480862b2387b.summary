-- embattled mayor @entity1 vowed " outright war " after @entity3 's @entity2 voted to strip him of most of his powers monday in a tumultuous meeting during which a charging @entity6 knocked down one of its members			1
nearly two weeks after @entity1 admitted to smoking crack cocaine in a " drunken stupor " -- an admission forced by a drug probe that resulted in extortion charges against a friend -- the mayor said he was done apologizing			1
he called monday 's vote " a coup d'etat " and compared it to @entity19 's invasion of @entity20 in 1990 , warning council members , " what goes around , comes around , friends			2
" " if you think @entity31 - style politics is nasty , you guys have just attacked @entity20 , " he said to groans and laughter in the council chambers			2
" and you will never see something -- mark my words , my friends , this is going to be outright war in the next election , and i am going to do everything in my power to beat you guys			1
" @entity41 , the council voted 36 - 5 to slash the budget of the mayor 's office and transfer most of his duties to the deputy mayor			1
@entity2 @entity47 said @entity1 " does n't understand the issues he 's facing , " and monday 's votes reduce him to " a figurehead			2
" " we are a great city , and the reality is mayor @entity1 does not represent the face of the city , " @entity47 said			2
" we are taking the steps we 're taking to give the deputy mayor the powers and the responsibility and the staff to exercise the functions that the mayor no longer can			1
" the council already has called on @entity6 to take a leave of absence and voted to strip him of his emergency powers last week			1
in monday 's session , @entity6 and his brother , @entity2 @entity69 , sparred with hecklers in the council gallery who chanted " @entity76 , " during a recess			1
during that break , @entity1 stomped over to his brother , knocking down @entity79 in the process -- an apparently accidental act for which the mayor had to issue another apology			1
@entity79 suffered a fat lip , her colleague , @entity86 , told @entity6			1
@entity86 demanded an apology from the mayor , who said the collision happened when he " rushed to my brother 's defense			1
" " i apologize to anybody that i accidentally hit when my brother was in an altercation over there , " @entity1 said			2
" i 'm asking you to apologize to @entity98 , " @entity86 replied			0
" absolutely , " @entity1 replied			0
" it was a complete accident , and i do sincerely apologize to you , @entity98			0
" apologies have become a matter of routine for @entity6 since his november 5 admission that he once used crack			1
he 's now battling other allegations of excessive drinking and abusing staffers that have emerged during the drug probe , which has not resulted in charges against the mayor so far			2
@entity1 has admitted to drinking too much and has pledged to restrain his consumption of alcohol			0
but he 's denied other accounts of public intoxication and the physical and verbal abuse of staffers			0
thursday , he answered a female aide 's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own , stunning the reporters who surrounded him and prompting another apologetic news conference			0
@entity1 says he did n't lie about crack use and he has refused to step down , insisting he would let voters of @entity128 's largest city decide on whether to keep him next year			0
he still appears to have intense support in his home turf in the blue - collar northwestern precincts of @entity3 , where supporters cheered him on over the weekend			1
monday 's vote came hours before the debut of " @entity135 , " a show he and his brother now host on @entity128 's @entity139 news network			1
on the show , @entity1 said he had n't had a drink in three weeks and was working on losing as much as 40 pounds			0
" if council wants to strip all my powers , do whatever they want to do , " he said			2
" i disagree with it , but you know what ? they have their rights			0
i think it 's wrong			0
i think it 's illegal			0
but people are going to have their say on october 27			1
" " i 'm feeling great , ' cause again , i know what i 'm doing is right for the taxpayers , " he added			0
in an attempt to head off monday 's vote , @entity69 introduced a separate measure calling for early elections instead			0
it was ruled out of order			0
" there are 383,000 people who voted for the mayor , and a lot of those people voted for each one for you , too , " he said			1
" they would n't want the mayor to take that right off each one of you , and it 's the same for the mayor			2
" but councilor @entity172 said @entity1 -- who has touted his expansion of @entity3 's subway system and vowed to derail what he calls the " gravy train " of city government -- was running both a " gravy train " and a " crazy train			1
" opinion : is that an addict standing next to you ? " he needs help , and i said that many times , but he did n't accept it , " @entity172 said			0
" this is the only route that i have to choose , and i leave up to the individual councilors their decision and i hope we made the right decision			0
" deputy mayor @entity193 , who inherits much of @entity6 's authority now , said he had n't spoken to the mayor monday evening -- " and given the bellicosity of his concluding remarks , i think it is wise to wait for some time			1
" @entity6 is a man of contrasts " we played football			1
and hopefully , using football as a metaphor , we can talk about strategies and tactics on a go - forward basis , " @entity193 said			0
" but the key right now i think is to let him settle down , seek advice from others -- at least others that he listens to			2
because he has n't listened to us that well over the past few weeks			0
and then talk together , privately , and see where it goes from there			0
" but @entity193 said that if @entity6 continues " to get in the way of good government , " the city could ask @entity219 's provincial government to remove him completely			1
@entity0 's @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
