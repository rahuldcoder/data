@entity0 , @entity1 -- organizers of the @entity4 hoped the soccer tournament could provide a catalyst for a " re-branding " of @entity1 , and arguably there is no group within the @entity10 that needs this makeover more than the @entity13 community			1
the @entity13 -- who count @entity16 - winning actress @entity15 and former athlete @entity17 among their number -- are descendants of @entity20 , mainly @entity22 settlers , who moved to the southern tip of @entity1 in the 17th century			1
making up just under six percent of the population -- numbering around three million from an overall population of nearly 50 million according to the 2007 @entity26 -- it is the white @entity13 people that were most closely associated with the ruling elite of the racist and oppressive apartheid regime that existed from 1948 to 1994			1
" there was a long time that @entity13 were perceived to be the polecats of the world , it is something we have to live with , " @entity33 , editor of @entity35 newspaper @entity34 told @entity2			1
" but people [ who come to the @entity42 ] will realize the @entity13 are very indigenous to @entity1			1
there 's a brand new generation coming through who have traveled all over the world			2
they are not seen as racist @entity13 they are seen a people of @entity1 , " he added			1
the @entity35 language , which is the third most spoken in @entity1 , like much of the group 's culture is entwined with the country 's recent divisive past ; the plan to enforce the teaching of @entity35 in black schools sparked the violence of the @entity60 uprising of 1976 in which 23 students died after police opened fire			1
it was the tradition of @entity66 conservatism and social conformity as well as the shackles of a problematic past , which drove musicians @entity70 and @entity72 to show a new face of their community through music			1
as part of punk outfit @entity78 -- which is an expletive - laden @entity35 ' phrase for " go away police car " -- the @entity82 - based band has expressed their situation by singing in @entity35 since 2003			1
" i think with [ our ] music we were saying we 're not part of that whole @entity13 mentality , our first album was an outlet for that and the songs were quite angry			2
things need to change , " lead singer and guitarist @entity93 told @entity2			0
the name , though offensive , was significant for the band members			0
" if you grow up as an @entity13 you have those images of cop cars driving around telling you what to do and how to behave , so the name was a way ... of leaving those mental bondages , of growing up in that community , behind , " bass player @entity72 said			1
" the @entity13 has always been told exactly what to do ... we rebelled against that and tried to forge a new direction , " @entity93 added			2
the controversial band 's socio - political songs and questioning of the @entity66 faith have seen them become pariahs in their own community , but as one of @entity1 's most popular groups -- who have toured with the @entity117 and @entity118 -- they are helping to redefine the @entity13			1
" there 's a lot of talk about our language dying out , there is fear and anxiety that our identity will be lost			2
my point of view : we 've never been pro-afrikaner or pro the @entity35 language -- we just are who we are , like or not			0
the most important thing is for people to give it space to breath , to grow , to allow change			0
" @entity139 is good , [ the @entity13 community ] should take on a new face			1
trying to hold onto what went before , to keep it the same is never going to work			0
there are a lot of people who are proud of being @entity35 , and i get a lot of emails saying that because of our music they 're proud of being @entity13 again or that they think @entity35 is cool , " @entity72 added			2
while sound - checking for a gig in the bohemian , @entity154 suburb of @entity0 , the musicians told @entity2 the @entity42 had helped to alleviate some of the racial tensions that had risen as a result of the murder of right - wing extremist @entity160			0
two black farm workers were formally charged in april			0
" before the @entity42 it felt like the country had gone back 15 years , the way things were going			2
but i think the greater majority of @entity1 want a unified country , " @entity93 said			1
and for a community that is almost defined by an all - consuming passion for the " @entity173 " national rugby union team , the irony that a new national image and that unity could be forged via a soccer event , traditionally a black sport , was not lost on skeptical @entity13			1
" prior to the @entity42 our readers were indifferent to the event			0
our sport coverage was rugby , rugby , and rugby ; even in the off - season			0
but now i hear stories all the time of @entity35 people who were not interested in soccer , glued to their televisions watching the @entity42			0
currently we have saturation coverage , and the readers like it			0
" @entity33 added the hosting of a big event had resonated with many @entity13 : " they feel a bit alienated , because it 's been a very black dominated @entity42 ... and no white footballer played a game for @entity199 , but they feel good that we 're showing well on a global stage			1
" afrikaners are fiercely patriotic , they love their country and they want to show their best side to all of the foreign visitors			2
" @entity206 , the 47 - year - old chairman of the @entity207 , is maybe an example of what @entity33 has noticed from the feedback of his readership			0
the six - foot - five , predominantly @entity35 speaking custodian was a former rugby union professional , playing flanker along side @entity173 - greats such as @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 in the 1990s			0
from the clubhouse based in the @entity13 capital of @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity206 told @entity2 he had been bitten by the soccer bug : " i had never watched football before the @entity42			2
now i go home and watch soccer , all the white guys talk football now			0
" @entity206 's rugby club -- which has seen 29 of its players go on to play for the national side -- has benefited from booming business over the last month thanks to its fortunate position a short walk from the @entity237 , a venue of six @entity42 matches			0
playing host to the throngs of foreign fans who flock to taste the specialty braai'ed ( barbequed ) meat on offer from the kitchen , has allowed @entity206 to contribute to what he told @entity2 was his hope for the most important legacy of the @entity42			0
" i would just like all the people who visited our country to go home and say , you know @entity1 , it 's not so bad			1
there is a bunch of good guys who are also there			0

@entity13 make up just under six percent of @entity1 's population
are descendants of mainly @entity22 settlers , who moved there in 17th century
the group 's culture is entwined with the country 's recent divisive past
