-- the man credited with making @entity4 's @entity3 commuter train line one of the best in the country is an apparent suicide , killed friday by the train he himself rode five days a week for more than two decades			1
shortly before 8 a.m. , @entity12 drove to a parking lot about two miles from his home in unincorporated @entity15 in suburban @entity4 , walked onto a track where someone had committed suicide three years ago and stepped in front of an oncoming @entity3 train , @entity11 sheriff @entity10 told reporters			1
the train 's lone engineer " saw a man standing on the tracks turning and looking at the train , " @entity10 said			1
" there was eye contact , he felt , between himself and the victim			0
" @entity12 , @entity3 's executive director , made no attempt to step off the tracks , and the train , which was traveling between 45 mph and 55 mph , could not stop in time , @entity10 said			1
none of the 27 people on the train was hurt			2
they included 24 passengers , two @entity3 employees , and the engineer , a @entity40 employee			2
the passengers completed their trips in taxis ; no other trains were delayed as a result of this incident , @entity10 said			0
" we have secured evidence at the scene and at the victim 's residence that would indicate that this was an intentional act on his part , " he said			0
a deputy on routine patrol came across the body within a minute of the incident , @entity10 said			0
he described the scene as " very gruesome			0
" @entity12 's death came a week after @entity3 announced it was investigating whether the 60 - year - old married father of two daughters got an unauthorized vacation payout last year of $ 56,000 , said @entity3 spokeswoman @entity63			1
it also came two hours before the @entity3 board was to have met to hear from an independent investigator about the allegation against @entity12 , who was on paid administrative leave from his $ 269,000 - per - year job			1
the meeting was delayed , @entity63 said			0
she said the apparent suicide was out of character for a man who cared deeply for his job and his co-workers -- so much that he made sure train personnel received counseling after witnessing similar incidents			2
she credited her former boss with having transformed the @entity4 rail system from one that in the 1980s was " dilapidated and rundown " to one that is now " the top among commuter railroads			1
" " this is a man who had an absolutely impeccable record and , honestly , was viewed as probably the premiere leader of commuter rail in the country			2
" @entity3 , for which @entity12 had worked since its formation in 1984 , moves 300,000 passengers per day along 11 lines over 550 miles of track serving six suburban communities in an area the size of @entity97 , she said			1
before that , he held several positions at the @entity100 in @entity101			0
on - time performance , according to @entity63 , is routinely at or above 97 percent , the best of any major city in the country and a record that area residents have grown to count on			0
" we literally get e-mails from people who say , ' my train was four minutes late twice this week , and i find that unacceptable , ' " @entity63 said			0
" he 's had a fabulous and unprecedented career and that makes it even more tragic			1
" " @entity12 served this agency with distinction for many years , " @entity3 said in a written statement			1
" today , we shall remember the good work he achieved with our board of directors and the men and women of @entity3			2
he was dedicated to our passengers and he always considered the men and women of @entity3 his family and there is a tremendous sense of loss within the agency			2
" deputy executive director @entity133 was named appointed acting executive director of @entity3 , which after @entity135 is the nation 's second - largest commuter rail system , said @entity138 , another @entity3 spokeswoman			1
the investigation was initiated after @entity3 officials received a tip from @entity142 , a reporter for @entity144 's @entity143 , about the claim , @entity63 said			1
" @entity12 surely did n't go to work for @entity3 to grab money he was n't entitled to , " @entity146 wrote friday on his blog			1
" nor do reporters get into the news business to provoke suicides			0
" he added , " i and others i 've talked to who were involved in the matter are , frankly , rattled			0
writing about this is part of my job , and the job needs to be done			0
but that does n't mean you do n't feel bad			0
i am sorry it had to end this way			0
