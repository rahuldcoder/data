the former imperial capital of @entity1 sits just below what was once the demilitarized zone between @entity5 and was , near the end of the war , the site of some of its fiercest fighting			1
you 've seen it in newsreel footage -- and recreated ( in @entity14 ) in @entity16 's " @entity15			1
" it 's one of the few areas of @entity5 i 've never been			1
@entity1 is , in many ways , a city of ghosts , of memories and spirits -- and we play on that in sunday 's episode			1
it begins with a camera movement inside a " @entity30 " -- the dollhouse - sized shrines that many believers keep outside their homes and businesses			2
the @entity36 are largely ancestor worshippers			0
helping your deceased relatives into the next life -- and making sure they are happy while there -- is important			0
on special days and holidays , families visit temples and pagodas and leave offerings , often food , sometimes replicas of money or appliances or luxuries for the departed			1
things they liked in life that might make the afterlife more comfortable			0
spirit houses , as i understand them , are designed to deal with the problem of hungry , dissatisfied spirits who may not be settled , who have , for one reason or another , unfinished business left behind			2
they sit out front , or near the house or store , usually filled with incense and offerings , in the hope of distracting the spirits away from the main destination			2
in the weeks following the initial @entity36 taking of the city of @entity1 , many hundreds -- if not thousands -- of citizens , deemed dangerous or counterrevolutionary or otherwise undesirable , were summarily executed and buried in unmarked mass graves by the communist forces			1
when the @entity83 and army of @entity5 retook the city , it was only at the end of brutal , house - to - house fighting and finally , airstrikes , that @entity1 was retaken -- flattening much of the city in the process			1
many , many people were lost , their bodies never identified or recovered			0
this , the inability to find the physical remains of a relative , is a particular agony to @entity96			0
for this reason , this episode is haunted by ghosts			1
we had n't intended it to be so			0
but that definitely emerged as a theme			0
you feel it as you drive the streets and early morning rice paddies on a scooter , walk the parapets of the ancient citadel , look at the flag hanging in the mist across the @entity113			0
at one point , a young woman i 'm having dinner with casually mentions that her mother does n't like her to go out after dark			0
i do n't want you to think that this episode of " @entity122 " is some kind of a bummer -- a depressing discussion of a war about which there are still strong feelings and disagreements here			2
one of the crazily awesome , incongruous things about @entity5 that i 've found from the first time i visited is how friendly , welcoming , quick to move beyond the past the @entity96 are			1
it is an incredibly beautiful country			2
one filled with passionate , proud cooks , and opinionated , enthusiastic eaters			0
you will see me with some old friends -- and you will , as always in @entity5 , see me eating some amazing food			1
and if you thought pho was the best thing ever ? wait ' til you see @entity142 .			0

@entity144 returns to a country he 's loved since his first visit
the city of @entity1 , @entity5 , is a city of spirits and ghosts
the episode deals with the past , but also with the *vibrant* present
