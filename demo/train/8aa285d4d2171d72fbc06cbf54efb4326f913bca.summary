a big asteroid will fly by @entity2 on monday , but @entity3 says do n't worry -- we 'll be safe			1
the asteroid is called 2004 @entity6			2
it 'll come about 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) from @entity2 , or about three times as far away as the moon at 11:19 a.m. et , according to @entity3			1
you 're wondering , does n't this happen all the time ? yes and no. there are lots of asteroids that pose a threat to @entity2 -- about 550 as of january 22			1
none are predicted to hit anytime soon			0
but asteroid 2004 @entity6 ( yes , we also wish it had a catchier name ) is big -- about a third of a mile ( a half - kilometer ) in size			2
it will be the closest known asteroid this large to pass near @entity2 until 2027 , that 's when an asteroid called 1999 an10 flies by us			1
" while it poses no threat to @entity2 for the foreseeable future , it 's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid , so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more , " @entity24 , the recently retired manager of @entity3 's @entity25 at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , said in a @entity3 press release			1
this asteroid is also interesting because you might be able to see it with strong binoculars or backyard telescopes			1

" asteroids are something special			0
not only did asteroids provide @entity2 with the building blocks of life and much of its water , but in the future , they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources			1
they will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system			0
there is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up			0
" @entity3 scientists will snap radar - generated images using the @entity67 antenna at @entity68 , @entity28 , and the @entity69 in @entity70			2

@entity72 has been designated as the new manager			1
" we should be getting some great radar images of this asteroid , " @entity72 told @entity1			1
" @entity77 would be the key to study the asteroid 's surface , give an idea of its shape , whether it has rocks and that kind of stuff on it			0
it 'll be really exciting			0
" if you do n't have binoculars or a scope , you can watch from the comfort of your computer on the @entity94			0
