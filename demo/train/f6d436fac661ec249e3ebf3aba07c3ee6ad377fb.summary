@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 was led through the back entrance of a @entity6 on the first day of april last year , he had no idea that he was about to be at the center of one of the most significant events in the history of telecommunications in @entity1			2
@entity4 , aka , ' the @entity13 ' shows off his 3g phone			0
will millions of other @entity1 follow his lead ? and he also had no idea that he had just become the victim of the ultimate @entity19 's joke			2
one of his friends had called the day before , told him there was an important meeting he should attend and to be sure to dress up			0
it turned out that @entity4 had been chosen to be the very first person to have the very first subscription ever given out in @entity1 for third - generation ( @entity26 ) mobile phone service			1
his face appeared in newspapers and on television programs for weeks			0
even today he 's still known by many as simply " the @entity13			0
" " it was like i was like president @entity33 , " @entity4 said jokingly			0
@entity4 , a trendy , 31 - year - old who works in advertising and can often be spotted wearing his favorite pair of black cowboy boots while smoking gold - tipped cigarettes , is exactly the type of customer @entity1 's mobile phone operators are hoping will be among the first to subscribe for 3g services			1
first introduced in @entity46 a decade ago , @entity26 wireless networks give subscribers faster internet connections , which means music , movies and games can be downloaded with greater ease , e-mail can be accessed much more quickly and other multimedia applications such as instant messaging and video - conferencing are possible on a mobile phone			1
after a slow start , @entity26 is now widely used in @entity46 and @entity58 , yet has had less than stellar adoption rates across @entity60 and in the @entity61 , where uptake has been stymied because of expensive handsets and pricing plans , poor network coverage and lack of consumer interest			1
for years , @entity68 has delayed the rollout of next - generation networks largely to complete technology for its homegrown 3g standard called @entity73 , which many experts say was developed to reduce @entity1 's dependence on foreign technology and spur the growth of its domestic telecom industry			2
last spring , the government began testing the new standard among select customers -- @entity4 was the first -- in a handful of cities and last month announced it would issue 3g licenses to the country 's three state - owned mobile phone carriers			1
@entity6 , the dominant provider by far , received the license for @entity73 , while @entity89 and @entity90 were given licenses for international standards used in @entity60 and the @entity61			1
the carriers have announced they will collectively spend almost $ 60 billion over the next several years to build their respective 3g networks while the government has set targets for tens of millions of subscribers by 2011			0
the billion - dollar question now that the guessing game surrounding when @entity1 would finally issue @entity26 licenses has ended , many experts are wondering exactly what , if any , impact next - generation networks will have in the biggest mobile phone market in the world			1
" that is a million - dollar question , " said @entity107 , founder of the @entity68 - based mobile and internet consulting firm @entity108			2
" essentially if you want to know how a market with 10 years experience is doing , the simplest thing to do is to look at @entity46			2
" while some say the success of @entity26 in @entity46 is mostly hype , the country , which has over 80 percent adoption rates , has become home to a " thriving mobile ecosystem , " said @entity107 , noting that second - generation ( @entity123 ) handsets are no longer sold there			1
two of the richest mobile social networking companies in the world are based in @entity46 , along with a number of other highly profitable firms that have developed cool content and even cooler applications , such as mobile commerce and mobile auctions , for 3g phones			1
similar businesses have begun to emerge in @entity1 and are creating mobile platforms aimed at the country 's technologically savvy youth , hungry for entertainment on - the - go and turned on by flashy 3g phones			1
" it is very good for us , " said @entity141 , whose @entity0 - based mobile search and ad provider @entity144 is positioned to directly benefit from @entity26 's higher data speeds			1
" [ @entity148 ] will use more mobile internet and more mobile data services , leading to more ad inventory , " he said			0
according to @entity155 's senior industry analyst @entity154 , even without 3g networks @entity1 telecoms already earn over 20 percent of their revenues from non-voice data usage , like text messages and ringtone downloads , which is on par with carriers in the @entity61 where high - speed networks have been in place for years			1
" i think this bodes well for future uptake in the market , " said @entity154			0
" @entity1 is leaps and bounds ahead of most other emerging markets , notably @entity169 where the figure is more like 10 percent			0
" however unlike @entity26 users in other markets , those in @entity1 have considerably less cash , which means its widespread adoption may boil down to one thing : cost			1
in a country where the average per capita income is only a few thousand dollars a year , next - generation wireless service may be prohibitive for a while			0
" in terms of immediate impact on the market , it is going to be very limited just like it was in any other country that launched @entity26 -- in the first two years , nothing happened , " said @entity107			2
" there wo n't be miracles			0
" power of the @entity1 consumer but if prices are affordable , especially on the handset side , some believe the demand for @entity26 may be driven by consumers in second - and third - tier cities which simply want to log onto the web			1
" pure internet usage will be a strong driver , " @entity200 spokesman @entity199 told @entity2			1
" today there is already a very high number of @entity206 users and the first time they enter the @entity206 is through their mobile phones			0
" and also for the first time , consumers may have more power than ever to shape the state - controlled telecommunications industry , which was restructured last year to pave the way for @entity26 and introduce more competition			1
faced with @entity6 's unproved td - scdma network that works mainly with less - than - fashionable handsets from domestic companies , many @entity1 may choose to switch the other carriers that have tried - and - tested 3g standards and are compatible with brand name handsets from foreign manufacturers			2
" i think consumers will ultimately be smart , and that is a challenge for @entity6 , " @entity221 , chairman of consulting firm @entity222 , told @entity2			0
" there is a good market in @entity1 , " added @entity221			2
" @entity1 like to adopt technologies and show them off			0
" @entity4 , who switches mobile phones at least twice a year , says he already is on the lookout for the next cool handset to flash around in front of his friends			0
yet when it comes to talking about being the first - ever 3g subscriber in @entity1 , he is slightly less exuberant			2
" it is not a very important thing in my life , " he said while smoking one of his golden cigarettes and sipping tea			0
" it was just a joke			0

@entity1 has restructured mobile market to make way for @entity26 and phones
@entity26 slow to be adopted in @entity60 and @entity61 but big in @entity46
internet usage will be strong driving factor for adoption of @entity26 in @entity1
@entity1 consumers will decide which state - owned mobile network succeeds
