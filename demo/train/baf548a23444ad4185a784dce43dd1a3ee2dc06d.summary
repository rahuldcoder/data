-- " a 13 - year - old girl called me an ape			1
" @entity4 was not impressed			1
one of the most successful proponents of a sport that is more @entity10 than any other , a hero in a country where its stars are gods , he was not going to take such an insult lightly			1
" i stopped , i called her out , got her escorted out of the ground , and from that point the awareness and the conversations that have been had around racism in this country have just skyrocketed , " he tells @entity0 's @entity13 series			2
@entity4 is a star of @entity21 , best described as an often - confusing mix of the two rugby codes , basketball , and its close gaelic football cousin			1
" @entity21 , " also known as @entity30 , reflects the nation 's continuing battle with the aftermath of its colonial past			1
on one hand it sometimes highlights appalling attitudes towards indigenous peoples -- after the incident with the girl , the president of the host team 's club joked on radio that @entity41 should be used to promote a stage production of @entity43 , effectively ending their friendship			2
on the other , it has made great efforts to welcome indigenous players ; there are 68 registered at the 18 @entity51 teams this year , and their 9 % total of the sport 's overall list is greater proportionally than the 2.5 % they make up of the country 's total population			1
so it was all the harder for @entity4 to accept being abused during a game that was part of the @entity30 's 2013 " @entity60 " -- and played at arguably the country 's most iconic sporting venue , the 100,000 - capacity @entity63			1
" i hope i 'm a person people look up to and say , ' i remember the day @entity4 did that at the @entity63			1
today is the day i 'm going to stand up for myself or stand up for somebody else who might not have a voice for themselves , ' " he says			0
" since last year , a lot more cases have come through , and i think that 's what needs to happen for it to improve			2
a lot more people need to call it out , need to say no to racism ... and we 're going to improve as a community from there			2
" in recognition of his work helping @entity86 youth and battling racism , @entity4 was named " @entity88 " in january , the same month he turned 34			1
" it 's a very humbling experience , " he says			0
" it 's been an amazing platform for me this year to talk about things i 'm passionate about -- like eliminating domestic violence and trying to get recognition in the constitution for @entity86 people			2
" it was quite dumbfounding for me to find out that we were n't part of ( @entity101 's ) constitution -- this is a document that 's over 112 years old that does n't recognize its first people			0
" when @entity108 settlers came to @entity101 in the 1800s , they took land from the indigenous people and forced the nomadic tribes to accept new ways of living , often splitting up families under a government policy of " assimilation " -- as highlighted in the acclaimed 2002 film " @entity119			2
" @entity10 politicians have since apologized for the past mistreatment , but @entity122 remain disadvantaged socially and economically compared with the overall population			1
@entity4 , like many modern @entity122 , is from a mixed - race family , with a father of @entity127 descent			1
born in @entity101 , his tribal name is @entity129 -- the people who live in the @entity131 , the largest in @entity101			0
his place of birth ( @entity134 , on the @entity135 near @entity136 , first settled by @entity108 in 1836 ) means he is also @entity137			0
" growing up , i did n't know what it meant to be @entity86 , " @entity4 recalls			2
" my mum was taken away from her family when she was five years old and we were n't really taught anything about what it meant to be @entity86 -- no language , no culture , no ceremonies , no nothing			0
" what we did know was where we came from , and that was @entity129 and @entity153 , so i 've had to do a lot of that journey , to find out information about that , in the last 10 years			0
" so for us , growing up , we just thought we were just like any other normal family			0
we did n't really see ourselves as mixed race			0
i copped stuff from people at school because of the different color and whatnot , but i had good support that helped me get through those tough times			2
" his parents separated when he was young , and he moved state to @entity169 with his mother in his early teens , and they settled in another small country town			0
up until that stage , @entity4 was a big fan of basketball star @entity174 , while his own talents were in soccer			2
however , there were no teams in his new hometown -- so his mum suggested having a go at @entity30			2
" i was very athletic , so the running part of it was good , " he says			0
" grabbing the ball was quite difficult because it could bounce everywhere , but i was able to pick that up pretty easily			0
" the main premise of @entity30 is simple : kick the oval - shaped ball between the two central posts to score maximum points ; if it goes through the two outside posts , the score is lower			1
it results in basketball - size scorelines , and with 18 players on each team -- wearing sleeveless tops known as " guernseys " and notoriously short shorts -- all kicking , passing , running , jumping and jostling at high intensity for two hours , it can be a confusing spectacle , as @entity4 admits			1
" you might come and watch a game and not know what 's going on			0
that 's because the players , the coaches , the supporters and even sometimes the umpires do n't know what 's going on either , " he says			0
" i still think that i 'm learning things and improving because it is a game that you can never truly master			0
" while it was started by @entity108 settlers in the 1850s , the game has strong links to an ancient @entity86 sport known as @entity218			0
" we used to play a game where we 'd have a possum skin filled with charcoal and they 'd kick it around , hand - pass it around , 50 - a - side , up and down these massive bits of land , and they would play for days , " @entity4 says			1
he has won two @entity30 titles , once as captain , and twice been awarded the game 's highest individual honor , the @entity234			1
his biggest challenge becoming an @entity30 player , he says , was not being an @entity86 in a white man 's world , but having to uproot from his family at the age of 17 and chase his sporting dream in @entity242 , where he had been drafted by the city 's @entity30 club the @entity242			1
" in the first year , i did n't look even close to playing in the senior side , i played reserves all year , " @entity4 says			1
" it was really a tough year for me and it was n't until the next year that i actually really committed and decided , ' this is what i want to do , this is what i wanted to be			0
' i started to make those real sacrifices and really working hard , making all the right choices to be a professional athlete			0
" he was inspired by @entity86 teammate @entity254 , nearly three years his senior			0
" the way our kinship system works , he 's actually my nephew -- something i only just found out recently , " @entity4 says			2
@entity254 was the first @entity242 player to pass 300 games , and @entity4 broke his club record in 2012 when he made his 304th appearance			1
he is now the most - capped indigenous player , having beaten @entity264 's record of 340 games for @entity266 this year -- the most by any player is 426			1
" to have him there to help mentor me , and show me the way , has just been an ideal situation for me and that 's what i would want for my brothers and any other people when they go to a football club , " he says of @entity254 , who retired in 2009			0
having had a long spell on the sidelines with injury last year , missing the club 's run to the preliminary final , @entity4 says he is determined to extend his career for as long as possible			1
" i know i can still improve and i think that is what drives me , " he says ahead of this weekend 's opening playoffs , where @entity242 will take on @entity286 after finishing the regular season as the top team			1
" a lot of people would say i 'm past it , but i still believe i have a lot to offer			0
" when he finally hangs up his boots , @entity4 aims to focus on the foundation he set up with @entity254 , which provides school scholarships for @entity86 children in @entity242			1
" i 've committed a lot of my time to my sport and there 's going to be a big void for me to fill , " he says			0
" it 'll be nice to have a bit more spare time for me			0
