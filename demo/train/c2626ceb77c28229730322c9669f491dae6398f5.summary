@entity0 , @entity1 -- when health care reform passed @entity5 more than two years ago , @entity3 yelled for her husband to come into the living room where she was watching the vote live on television			1
" i was so happy , " @entity3 remembers			0
" i yelled for @entity10 i said , ' do you know what this means ? do you know what this means ? ' " the historic vote meant their 18 - month - old daughter , @entity17 , would be able to keep her health insurance			1
without health care reform , she would have gotten kicked off her parents ' insurance , perhaps as early as her 5th birthday , because her care is so expensive			1
" i was like , @entity17 's covered now ! " @entity3 remembers			2
" but now @entity17 's parents are worried they wo n't be able to breathe easily again			2
this week , the @entity27 is hearing a debate on health care reform			1
the court could keep the reform intact , repeal parts of it , or get rid of the law altogether			2
" i 'm really scared , " @entity3 says			0
" like , i - ca n't - sleep scared			0
" ' completely blue in her crib ' @entity17 was born healthy , but when she was 11 months old her parents woke up in the middle of the night in their @entity0 , @entity1 , home to find her having a seizure			2
" she was completely blue in her crib and shaking , " @entity3 remembers			0
it was to be the first of hundreds of seizures -- sometimes thirty in one day			0
@entity17 has been hospitalized about six times and each hospitalization cost more than $ 50,000			2
she 's now on two drugs to control the seizures and carries oxygen with her wherever she goes because she stops breathing when she has her seizures			0
she needs speech therapy and frequent doctor 's visits			0
see more about @entity17 and her family @entity56 , @entity17 's father , gets health insurance through his work as a video game designer			2
before health care reform , there was a $ 5 million lifetime limit on @entity17 's insurance policy			1
@entity17 is now 3 and her parents calculate she could hit that cap by her 5th birthday , and almost certainly by her 10th			2
see a quick breakdown of key health care reform issues health care reform made lifetime limits illegal -- which is why @entity17 's family breathed easier when it passed -- but now her parents are worried the @entity27 could restore the limits and @entity17 would lose her insurance			1
@entity3 has been so passionate about health care reform she contacted the office of sen. @entity75 ( @entity1 ) and @entity76 to advocate for the law			1
if @entity17 does lose her current insurance , her parents know there 's no way another insurance company will want to insure her because her care is so expensive			1
" they 'd be crazy to want to insure her , " @entity3 says			0
" i mean , i would n't want to insure her if i was an insurance company			0
" watching the @entity27 case closely several provisions of health care reform have already gone into effect , so millions of other people , like @entity17 , stand to lose a lot if all or part of it is reversed			1
for example , 2.5 million young americans get to stay on their parents ' insurance until their 26th birthday because of health care reform , according to the @entity97 administration			1
seniors and people with disabilities have saved $ 3.2 billion on prescription drugs because of health care reform and insurance companies and 45 million women have received free mammograms and pap smears because of health care reform			1
there are ripple effects , too			0
after health care reform passed , @entity3 and @entity17 felt more secure about @entity17 's future and decided to have another child			1
@entity17 's little brother , @entity111 , was born two weeks ago			0
@entity112 : should health insurance be mandatory ? @entity17 's parents know not everyone shares their enthusiasm about health care reform			1
some people even traveled to @entity119 to protest in front of the @entity27 this week			2
in particular , they object to the " individual mandate , " which requires nearly all @entity122 to purchase insurance or pay a fine			0
the protesters object to being forced to pay for something they do n't want , but @entity3 and @entity17 see it differently			0
at any point in time they say someone could find themselves in a difficult situation like they 're in now and would want a system that insures you no matter how sick you are			0
as @entity17 puts it , " i think people just sort of need to change their mindset about health care			1
" @entity2 's @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
