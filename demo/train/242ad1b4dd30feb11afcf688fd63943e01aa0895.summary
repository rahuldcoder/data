in a country where the image of @entity5 is still revered and taxi drivers hang @entity5 medallions from their rear - view mirrors almost like lucky talismans , @entity1 's " red culture " revival was always going to have traction			1
in the sprawling riverside megalopolis of @entity12 , the charismatic and urbane politician @entity1 launched a " smash black , sing red " campaign that promoted @entity15 communist culture as zealously as it cracked down on organized crime			1
from june 2009 , @entity1 led a law and order drive that resulted in the arrest of thousands of suspected gangsters , but critics claim it also targeted his political adversaries			2
the crackdown may have thrilled many in @entity12 's massive municipality of 32.8 million people -- almost four million of whom are rural migrant workers seeking work in the urban center -- but @entity1 's law - and - order campaign touched on one of @entity15 's growing social and political fault lines			1
while many are becoming fabulously wealthy in the new @entity15 , millions more feel they are missing out on the country 's economic transformation			2
@entity1 's red - tinged economic policies -- which have included millions spent on social housing -- may have garnered him a rock star status in @entity12 , but almost 1,000 miles from the @entity41 city in @entity42 , some party chiefs were taking a different view			1
his populist policies and high - profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform - oriented faction within the @entity48 ( @entity48 )			1
the division emerged in the famous " cake theory " spat between @entity1 and @entity52 party chief @entity51 in 2011			2
@entity51 at the time stated that @entity15 needed to pursue economic growth before it could worry about how to divide the wealth , saying that " one must bake a bigger cake first before dividing it			2
" @entity1 was said to have responded : " some people think [ ... ] that one must bake a large cake before dividing it ; but this is wrong in practice			0
if the distribution of the cake is unfair , those who make the cake wo n't feel motivated to bake it			0
" political analysts say the spat , which was widely aired on @entity15 media last year , drives to the heart of the factional problems besetting the @entity48			0
the political divisions came to a boil in march 2012 , when @entity15 's national legislature convened its annual meeting in @entity42			2
speaking to reporters on march 9 on the sidelines of a panel discussion of @entity12 delegates , @entity1 defended his policies			2
" ask any citizen on the street if they support fighting corruption and they 'll say ' yes ' , " he boomed			0
addressing the rich - poor divide , he said : '' if only a few people are rich then we are capitalists , we 've failed			0
" that may have been @entity1 's last stand			1
timeline : @entity1 's fall from grace a few weeks earlier , @entity95 , his handpicked former police chief , had tried to defect to the @entity97 consulate in the neighboring @entity99 city of @entity100 , triggering a political crisis that rocked the leadership in @entity42			1
on march 14 , the prime minister @entity103 obliquely reprimanded @entity12 's leadership over the @entity51 incident during the premier 's annual press conference			0
@entity103 also refered to the damage wrought by the @entity109 - a reference that alluded to @entity1 's red revival in @entity12 - and said that the city 's stellar double - digit economic performance had been the fruits of several administrations and not just @entity1 's work alone			1
on march 15 , the state - run @entity117 news service announced that @entity1 had been dismissed as @entity12 party chief and , almost a month later , he was suspended from the @entity48 's @entity120 and its @entity121 -- the second - highest decision - making body in @entity15 -- ahead of investigations for " serious disciplinary violations			1
" @entity1 's dismissal is the most sensational political scandal to hit the @entity48 in recent years			1
as a " princeling " - a son of a revolutionary veteran -- @entity1 was considered a strong contender for promotion into the @entity132 of the party 's @entity121 , whose nine members decide how to run @entity15			1
but then , things were always likely to be different for the maverick cadre			0
his father @entity137 , who had a similar relaxed and open style , was imprisoned and tortured during the @entity109 as a " capitalist roader			0
" his credentials as an economic reformer were cemented during the 1980s when he famously visited the @entity143 factory in the @entity97			0
seeing just two planes on the tarmac , @entity144 asked if they were the only planes the factory planned to produce			0
when he was told that @entity143 only made the planes that were on its order books , he immediately saw the problems of @entity15 's planned economy which produced goods regardless of whether there was a market or not			2
@entity1 himself spent five years in jail during the @entity109 and was said to have denounced his father during the tumultuous political upheaval -- an action that some argue may have cost him political allies in a culture that strongly values family ties			1
after his release , @entity1 entered @entity166 's history department in 1977 and two years later , after gaining a degree , @entity1 got into the master 's degree program in journalism , the first ever , at the @entity170			2
" his top ambition then was to be a @entity15 journalist posted overseas , " recalls a classmate and close friend of @entity1			1
after graduation , however , @entity1 did not pursue his ambition to become a foreign correspondent			0
instead , he worked his way up as a local party and government official			0
he spent 17 years in @entity182 , a charming but gritty coastal city in northeastern @entity15			0
he became @entity182 mayor in 1993 and transformed it into a popular investment and tourism destination			0
as early as 1999 , @entity1 was expected to move to @entity42 for a ministerial post but his promotion was aborted when he failed to get elected into the @entity120 , the @entity48 's ruling elite			2
@entity1 served as the governor and later party chief of @entity191 , a rust - belt region in northeast @entity15 which then boasted of large but mostly money - losing state - owned enterprises			1
in @entity191 , @entity1 dealt with high unemployment and endemic corruption			0
in 2004 , when @entity1 finally got elected into the elite @entity120 , he moved to @entity42 as minister of trade and commerce			0
" he was a tough and effective negotiator in terms of defending @entity15 's global trade policies and interests , " said @entity197 , a professor at the @entity198 and @entity1 's former classmate at @entity166			1
for decades , @entity197 recalled that @entity1 stood out as one of @entity15 's most dynamic and maverick politicians			1
instead of reading prepared speeches , for example , he often spoke extemporaneously			0
" he would have had a chance to become @entity15 's top leader , if @entity15 had direct elections			2
but he shows too much personality and charisma in the @entity216 political culture that emphasizes collective leadership , " said @entity211 , a political science professor at the @entity212			0
during @entity1 's anti-corruption crackdown , @entity1 relied mainly on @entity95 , a tough and decorated policeman who served as @entity12 's police chief from 2009 to 2011			1
the campaign led to thousands of arrests and several executions			0
@entity51 was promoted to vice mayor as a reward			0
ironically , it was also @entity51 who torpedoed @entity1 's career			1
on february 8 , 2012 , @entity51 was unexpectedly reported to be " on leave " for health reasons			0
days later , @entity51 mysteriously fled into the @entity97 consulate in @entity100 , six hours ' drive away from @entity12			0
the next day , @entity51 left the consulate " of his own volition , " @entity97 officials said , and was taken into custody by security officials			0
his revelations led to a murder investigation involving @entity1 's family			1
in april of the same year , @entity1 's wife @entity241 and a family aide , @entity242 , were detained on suspicion of having murdered @entity244 businessman @entity243			1
during her one - day trial that august , @entity241 issued a statement saying she did n't deny the accusations levied against her , but " accepted all the facts written in the indictment " -- including poisoning @entity243 at a time when she thought her son 's life was in danger , according to the state - run @entity117 news agency			1
@entity241 received a suspended death sentence , which is expected to be commuted to life in prison after two years			0
@entity242 was sentenced to nine years in prison			0
finally in august this year , the 64 - year old stood trial at the @entity263 in eastern @entity264 on charges of bribe - taking , embezzlement and abuse of power			1
during the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place over several days and featured testimony from both his wife and @entity51 , @entity1 denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution 's case against him , according to court accounts			1
days before the court announced the date for delivering the verdict , @entity1 reiterated his innocence but said he anticipated a lengthy imprisonment in a letter written to his family			2
read more : @entity1 jailed for life but then on sunday , september 23 @entity1 learned his fate : guilty of all charges and a life term in prison			1
the fall from grace of this one - time rising star was complete , leaving @entity15 watchers to ponder whether this was a statement of intent from president @entity295 as he continues with his anti-corruption drive .			2

@entity298 politician @entity1 promoted @entity15 communist culture
his populist policies were seen to challenge a faction of the party
@entity1 jailed for life for bribe - taking , embezzlement and abuse of power
