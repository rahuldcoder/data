@entity0 -- time after time wednesday , @entity3 director @entity2 insisted last month 's prostitution scandal in @entity6 was an aberration -- just poor choices by a dozen agents under the influence of alcohol			1
" this is not a cultural issue , this is not a systemic issue , " @entity2 told the @entity12 , arguing that similar misconduct has n't occurred on thousands of other overseas trips by @entity3 agents			1
" on this particular trip , we had individuals who made very bad decisions			0
" he maintained that view when sen. @entity24 , @entity25 , noted the agents used their own names when signing in prostitutes as overnight guests in their hotel rooms			0
does n't that show the agents lacked any fear of disclosure or discipline , @entity31 asked			0
@entity2 responded that " between the alcohol and i do n't know , the environment , these individuals did some dumb things , " adding that he did not believe they acted because they thought their behavior would be tolerated			2
in his own @entity3 career spanning decades , @entity2 noted , he never witnessed such behavior			1
to @entity31 and other senators on the panel investigating the night of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes in @entity51 , @entity2 's personal dedication and loyalty to the agency he heads might be preventing him from accepting what seems obvious to them			1
" i continue to believe that the problem is broader than you believe it to be , " @entity31 said to @entity2 at the end of wednesday 's hearing			1
she later told reporters : " i think he has a difficult time coming to grips with the fact that he has a broader problem than just this one " episode			0
photos : a decade with the @entity3 the hearing was the first by a congressional committee on the april incident that embarrassed the nearly 150 - year - old agency and raised security concerns			1
in @entity6 as part of the advance details before president @entity81 arrival to attend the @entity82 , a dozen agents hit the clubs of @entity51 for a night of drinking that ended with them bringing women back to their hotel rooms			1
a morning - after dispute between one agent and a woman over payment led to a dozen @entity3 members being sent home and the resulting media coverage and investigations			2
@entity31 and committee chairman sen. @entity96 , an independent from @entity98 who caucuses with the @entity100 , called an announcement at the hearing that the @entity104 's acting inspector general will launch an independent investigation of the @entity6 incident " a big change " and " significant			2
" previously , the acting inspector general , @entity108 , was going to review the internal investigation by the @entity3			2
in addition , at least two other congressional panels are looking into the scandal , and the military is investigating 12 members also allegedly involved			2
in his opening statement wednesday , @entity96 said it was hard to believe that on one night , the agents involved " suddenly and spontaneously did something they and other agents never had done before			1
" @entity122 chairmen praise @entity3 response to prostitution scandal @entity96 and @entity31 provided new details of the incident , describing how the @entity3 agents went out on the town in groups of two or three to four different strip clubs and night clubs and returned to their hotel with foreign women who were signed in as overnight guests			1
@entity31 said the circumstances suggested that " different rules apply on the road			0
" @entity2 , however , repeatedly argued the incident reflected misconduct by a few bad actors in an otherwise professional and exemplary agency			2
he apologized for what happened and declared himself " dumbfounded " when word of what happened first reached him the next day			0
" when many of these people were interviewed , i do n't think they could explain why they exhibited the behavior they did , " he said , adding that " there is no excuse for that type of behavior from a conduct perspective and a national security perspective			0
that type of behavior was reckless			0
" @entity2 also revealed that two of the @entity3 agents who initially said they would resign over the scandal now are seeking to challenge their ouster			1
he said the agency will seek to revoke the security clearances of the two , which would effectively prevent them from continuing to work for the @entity3			2
under respectful but persistent questioning by the panel members , @entity2 said the misconduct never compromised the security plan for the @entity81 trip			1
3 @entity3 agents refuse prostitution scandal polygraph the incident involved roughly 20 alleged prostitutes and has resulted in the dismissal of nine @entity3 members			1
three others were cleared of serious misconduct			0
the military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 service members , but has yet to announce any results			0
@entity31 noted that " it is basic ' counterintelligence 101 ' that @entity3 personnel and others holding sensitive positions of trust in the @entity188 government should avoid any situation that could provide a foreign intelligence or security service or criminal gangs with the means of exerting coercion or blackmail			2
yet two of the primary means of entrapment -- sexual lures and alcohol -- were both present here in abundance			0
" while preliminary findings are that no weapons or classified material was in the agents ' rooms , those involved " could easily have been drugged or kidnapped , or had their liaisons with these foreign national used to blackmail them , " she said			2
" they willingly made themselves potential targets not only for intelligence or security services , but also for groups like " drug cartels			0
@entity122 defends @entity3 amid prostitution investigation @entity2 said in his opening statement that " at the time the misconduct occurred , none of the individuals involved in misconduct had received any specific protective information , sensitive security documents , firearms , radios or other security related equipment in their hotel rooms			1
" in addition , @entity2 noted that allegations of similar misconduct by @entity3 personnel in @entity236 in march 2011 appeared to be untrue			1
" after several days in @entity239 and conducting 28 interviews with hotel managers and employees , individuals from the @entity188 @entity244 , other government agencies and contract employees assigned to assist the @entity3 ... no evidence was found to substantiate the allegations , " he said			0
the alleged incident was reported by @entity1 affiliate @entity248 in @entity249			0
the station cited an unnamed @entity188 government contractor who worked extensively with the @entity3 advance team in @entity239 before an @entity81 visit			1
the source said he was with about a dozen @entity3 agents and a few @entity188 military specialists at a strip club in the city a few days before @entity81 arrived			1
the men drank heavily at the club , the source said , and most of them paid extra for access to a vip section where they were provided sexual favors in return for cash			0
@entity2 said wednesday that the owner of the business was interviewed and provided a sworn written statement saying " he had no knowledge or any other information that any @entity3 personnel had been to his business or information about misconduct by @entity3 personnel			1
" he outlined previously reported steps being taken to prevent future instances , including enhanced supervision on such assignments and a reinforced code of conduct			0
@entity2 also encouraged agents to blow the whistle on any misconduct by peers that they encounter			2
" i do n't think that our men and women need these guidelines because we have men and women of character , we have men and women of integrity , " he said			0
@entity31 remained unpersuaded , telling reporters after the hearing she was disturbed by @entity2 's repeated insistence that the @entity6 scandal was an isolated incident			1
meanwhile , three @entity308 agents are under investigation for allegedly soliciting sex in @entity51			0
one of them had a long - term relationship with a prostitute , two government sources familiar with the investigation said			0
investigations focus on agents ' activities , relationships in @entity6 the @entity308 agents were not involved in security for the president 's trip , the government sources said			1
the @entity308 agent 's relationship with the prostitute came to light after a @entity3 agent voluntarily reported to his superiors that he was at a party at the agents ' @entity51 apartment on april 13 where the three agents and several women were present , the government sources said			2
the @entity3 agent is the 13th employee to be caught up in the @entity6 scandal			1
he is on administrative leave , according to several sources , but is not expected to lose his job because he came forward on his own to report the incident			0
@entity1 's @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 contributed to this report .			0
