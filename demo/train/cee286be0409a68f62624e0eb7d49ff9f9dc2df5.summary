-- she 's been a comedian , talk - show host and feared red carpet fashion critic			0
now you can add winner of " @entity7 " to @entity9 ' lengthy resume			1
@entity10 and @entity9 attend " @entity7 " season finale sunday in @entity12			1
after weeks of competition , the 75 - year - old dynamo beat out 15 other contestants , including @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , to take the top spot in this season 's edition of the reality show hosted by @entity10			1
rivers went up against poker champion @entity24 in sunday night 's finale in which both women were charged with planning a @entity28 party and silent auction for the last and deciding task			1
" they 're both tough , they 're both smart and they both hate each other , " @entity10 observed at the beginning of the show			0
the apparent tension between @entity23 and @entity37 continued in the final boardroom , part of which played out in front of a live audience , with both finalists bickering and interrupting each other repeatedly as @entity10 looked on			1
in the end , @entity37 raised far more money at her event , but @entity23 was able to attract more celebrities and provide a better overall experience for the guests at her party , and @entity10 declared her the winner of the competition			1
" your level of energy has been amazing , " he told @entity23			2
the victory means $ 250,000 for @entity23 ' charity : @entity64 's love we deliver			1
if the series thrives on conflict , it got plenty of mileage out of @entity23			2
she blew up at country singer @entity71 , referred to another contestant as a " stupid blonde " and smashed a champagne glass out of frustration at one point			0
but @entity23 seemed to be especially infuriated by @entity37 , calling her a " despicable human being " -- the tamest of the insults she hurled in @entity37 's direction over the course of the series			1
rivers even walked out in a huff after her daughter , and fellow contestant , @entity88 was fired from the show			0
the exit , complete with bleeped obscenities , was turned into a cliffhanger of sorts when it seemed like @entity23 might not come back , but she returned to the show for the next task			2
you might think a show that 's best known for the phrase " you 're fired " might not do so well in a bad economy when thousands of people have heard similar words for real at their workplaces , but the series averaged more than 8 million viewers a week , according to @entity108			0
@entity108 : did the right one win ? revived formula " @entity114 " made a splash when it debuted in 2004 , making a reality television star out of @entity10 and contestants such as @entity113			0
for several seasons , the series took ambitious young mogul wannabes , divided them into teams and had them compete in tasks that ranged from selling lemonade to creating advertising campaigns for major corporations			0
the contestants vied for the chance to run one of @entity10 's companies for a year , and @entity10 fired someone from the losing team each week until he selected an apprentice			2
over the years , ratings for the show gradually declined , but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of " @entity7			0
" the tasks , pressure - cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same , but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity			2
the first " @entity7 " top spot went to @entity145 , the prickly judge on " @entity147 's @entity146 " who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation @entity150 to dinner after her memorable performance on the show			0
@entity145 also made several appearances on this season 's " @entity7 , " sitting in as @entity10 's " eyes and ears " during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another			1
@entity145 's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities , especially @entity161 , who glared icily at @entity145 when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife , @entity162 , for help in raising money during the various tasks			1
perhaps @entity162 might be tempted to try competing on the show herself			0
@entity167 announced last month it is bringing back " @entity7 " for another installment in the spring of 2010 , @entity108 reported .			0
