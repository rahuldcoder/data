it was one of a thousand little conversations that fill each day in a third - grade classroom			0
as teacher @entity5 read a book featuring a @entity8 character , a student brought her fingers to her eyes and tugged on the edges , stretching them into narrow slits			0
" i 'm @entity15 , " she told the child , " and when you do that , it hurts my feelings			0
" the student snapped to attention			0
" oh ! i 'm sorry ! " she told her teacher , and they went back to their book			0
it was a quick back - and - forth with a big lesson , but it came from a trained teacher who had rehearsed what to say			0
just as @entity5 learned to teach math and reading , she has practiced how to squelch unwitting bias and stereotyping before it has a chance to grow into bullying or racism			1
little insults and acts of disrespect once shrugged off or ignored -- just kids being kids -- are now treated in some schools as important chances to learn			0
lessons have long been built around @entity51 , @entity49 remembrance week , @entity46 and countless others holidays and awareness weeks			1
but at schools around the country , learning about bias related to race , gender and sexuality is part of everyday teaching			1
@entity5 , who teaches at @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , began anti-bias training with the @entity67 's @entity66 program two years ago and immediately began to share those lessons with her colleagues			0
the program is active in 25 states and offers training and lesson plans around family diversity , gender stereotyping and ending bullying			1
@entity5 did n't need help spotting right and wrong around racial diversity and gender bias , but training helped her find the words and tone to explain it to young children , especially when it came to matters of sexuality			1
young students sometimes do n't realize what they 're saying or how painful a comment on the playground can be			1
" she had no idea that kind of thing was hurtful -- they do n't want to hurt anyone 's feelings , " @entity5 said of the third - grader who tugged at her eyes			1
" a lot ( of teachers ) are scared to say anything because they 're scared they 're going to say the wrong thing			1
" it 's not easy for parents , either			1
so how can adults manage conversations about complicated issues with the youngest of kids ? here 's some guidance from educators doing it ever day : holidays , awareness weeks and celebratory months are a great way to start a conversation with young people			1
last week , the media literacy program @entity119 released a video of an 11 - year - old analyzing @entity122 's " @entity123 " speech			0
in powerful , unscripted responses , they explained how words spoken decades ago affected them and identified work that still needs to be done			0
but educators caution that cultural days or awareness weeks might touch only on clothing , holidays or food -- and serve up only information that suggests how people are different			1
on @entity51 , schools might examine only @entity139 history but ignore modern civil rights issues or @entity122 's messages about poverty and peace , said @entity144 , the director of @entity66			1
" it can be approached in ways that students do n't feel that it 's relevant			1
it 's something their parents took care of , " @entity144 said			1
" it 's really important to extend dr. @entity122 's message ... taking an intersectional approach , talking about gender stereotypes , class disparities			0
" some of the most powerful learning comes from answering kids ' questions about what 's going on in the world or what they see in the hallways of their school			0
and sometimes , the best way to explain an issue to kids is to find a story that 's designed for them , educators said			2
when her students are facing a conflict , @entity5 , the @entity63 teacher , is likely to call upon a long list of children 's books to help them work through it			2
just as students remember a one - on - one conversation with teachers , they see themselves in stories and characters and look to the lessons in books to model their own responses			1
" if i 'm having trouble with name - calling in my classroom , i 'm going to pull a read - aloud , " @entity5 said			0
" it 's tempting to believe young children are innocent and unaware of the world around them , but they are listening and repeating what they hear on tv or from older kids and adults around them			1
@entity5 has caught even young children saying something is " so gay			1
" sometimes they do n't know what it means , but they 've heard it used elsewhere			2
often , @entity5 said , they understand that " gay " means something like " a man and a man love each other			0
" they even know they 're using the word " gay " to say something is bad			0
they just do n't make the connection that their comment is disrespectful to people who are gay , @entity5 said			2
" ' we do n't use somebody 's identity as an insult , ' " she tells students			2
@entity144 said they heard a lot of questions from educators after the shooting death of @entity230 by a police officer in @entity232 , @entity233 , and during protests that followed			2
teachers knew their students were talking about it , but few knew how to explain it to young people			1
" students are having these conversations without us , and we know it 's really important for adults to be part of the conversation and model effective , respectful ways to have them , " @entity144 said			2
welcoming schools and other anti-bullying programs are ultimately meant to teach children and improve school climates , but the training demands adults examine their own biases and how they talk to children at school and home			1
it can be uncomfortable for adults to consider and challenge their own beliefs			0
" it 's a predictable part of this process [ that ] there 's some resistance , " @entity144 said			0
" there 's going to be someone who is not happy			0
" the @entity66 curriculum is transparent , she said -- it includes family nights and offers guidance to administrators and teachers on how to deal with those who might disagree with how they handle lessons about sexuality , gender and other topics			2
but even among educators committed to creating a healthy school climate , it can be tough			2
@entity5 recalls exercises such as asking teachers to write which identities apply to them -- race , ethnicity , gender , for example -- then asking them to examine which ones opened doors for them and which ones made life harder			2
conversations can be intense and revealing			0
there are reminders , too , that adults can learn from children , too			0
after all , young students do n't like to hurt each other 's feelings , @entity5 said			1
" we need to take advantage of that default to compassion , " she said , " and harness it			0

teachers and parents do n't always know how to talk to young children about bias and bullying
educators say it ca n't just be a conversation around @entity51 or other awareness holidays
