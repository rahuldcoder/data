-- moviegoers have grown increasingly intense about avoiding '' spoilers '' ( probably because of all the information that spills out of the @entity4			0
) in that light , " @entity13 , " a benignly inspirational @entity6 sports drama about the legendary racehorse who won the @entity9 in 1973 , offers a fascinating test case for how much spoilers sometimes do n't matter			1
going into the movie , we absolutely know that @entity13 , the chestnut @entity17 who galloped to triumph through a rare combination of total speed and maximum stamina , will win his three big races ( the first time a horse had done so in 25 years			1
) yet there he is , in his famous blue - and - white blinker hood , pounding the track at the @entity28 , starting way in the back ( as was his style ) , then overtaking one horse after another , the camera following right on his hooves			2
and damned if , at that moment , we are n't as excited as children , our hearts in our throats as he thunders to victory , almost as if we had no idea what was coming			0
when @entity13 is running his races , the movie has a hokey , old - fashioned appeal			1
it uses a fantastic gospel anthem to stoke our feelings , the @entity49 ' 1969 rendition of '' @entity50			0
'' and that song , with its funky - sublime syncopation , its waves of lordly joy , makes us feel that , yes , @entity13 really was a miracle horse , a competitor graced by @entity57			1
off the racetrack , however , " secretariat " is a sketchy and rather innocuously upbeat movie			1
the director , @entity61 ( " @entity62 , " ) often seems to be aiming for the same @entity64 demographic that helped make a hit out of " @entity66			1
" i personally have no objection to a horse film that views a creature as magnificent as @entity13 with religious awe , but in this case the uplift has a downside			1
the film is so insistently square it undercuts the very drama it 's out to capture			2
the central figure , @entity77 ( @entity78 ) , is a housewife who knew nothing about running a horse farm when she took over the management of her ailing father 's @entity84 in @entity86			2
@entity77 wins @entity13 in a coin toss ( though the film suggests it 's her womanly vantage that leads her to foresee how the horse 's bloodlines will give him racing strength			1
) it 's a pleasure to see her take charge , fighting her way up in a racehorse world thick with the corruptions of men			2
@entity102 , wearing @entity101 's hair , makes @entity77 devoutly traditional but never prim ; it does n't scare her that she 's in over her head			0
she recruits the eccentric trainer @entity104 , played by @entity105 , and the actor , wearing crazy hats and spouting @entity108 whenever he gets angry , makes us feel his horse fervor			0
@entity77 , in her devotion to @entity13 's racing career , tears her family life apart			1
yet this central conflict comes to very little			0
( @entity116 plays her husband with just enough mild testiness to make you wish he 'd shown more			0
) @entity77 's obsession remains flawless , noble , benevolent			0
the only real drama is that ( spoiler ! ) @entity13 occasionally loses			1
as long as he 's winning , though , this pleasantly rote movie will rouse you			2
