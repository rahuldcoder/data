-- to an outsider , @entity1 has all the makings for the stereotypical " eighth - graders start making scrappy recordings in their home and become overnight sensations " " @entity8 " special			1
only nothing about the band 's success -- which includes six albums , performances on " @entity14 " and " @entity15 , " among others , and touring as an opening act for @entity18 -- has come overnight			1
" we 've been doing it for a long time , " said @entity19 , one of the band 's founding members and lead vocalists			1
co-founder @entity24 , the band 's bass player who shares lead vocal responsibilities with @entity19 , agrees			1
" i feel like everything we 've done has been this slow burn , " @entity24 said			1
true , despite the guys knowing each other for 20 years , @entity1 is n't exactly living the large , rock - star life that fans might think			2
" it 's kind of disappointing , " @entity19 said with a laugh , " twenty years and this is it ? " if i was not me and i saw me -- i would assume , ' this guy 's got like a million bucks			2
he 's been on " @entity38			0
" his life is insane			0
' but ( that life ) has nothing to do with mine , " he said			0
in almost two decades of existence , @entity1 has been able to make a living with its music , currently headlining a tour to promote the album " @entity47			2
" " we worked hard for it , " @entity19 said of the band 's accomplishments			1
@entity19 and @entity24 met in suburban @entity52 in the 1990s when they were in the eighth grade , and the duo began a creative relationship that involved writing and recording songs onto tapes			1
unlike bands that develop a following on the road , @entity1 evolved in the opposite direction			2
they made an impression on fans in the @entity52 area and enjoyed creating songs at their home studio			0
not until @entity72 's then - girlfriend slipped a copy of an album to @entity18 frontman @entity75 did the possibility of @entity1 becoming a touring band ever come up			1
liking what he heard on the album , @entity75 sent the members of @entity1 a " really nice letter , " @entity19 recalled , asking if they 'd like to come on tour			1
the letter also asked a lot of questions and sought details about @entity1 to which @entity19 did n't have the answers			1
he finally had to say to @entity75 , " this band is just some dudes in a basement			0
" joining @entity18 on tour proved to be a valuable experience , and group members credit that band with giving them their " first step into working " as a touring act			0
but both @entity19 and @entity24 remain the most passionate about writing and recording a song			1
@entity24 said , " the process is the important part			2
... it 's the only thing with real meaning			0
" there is a vulnerability involved in writing a song and bringing to the band to play for the first time , he said			2
the results can be and have been " devastating , " he said			0
but for the most part , " ( the song ) becomes everybody 's and that 's my favorite part , " he said			0
" sometimes it 's terrifying , " he said of the band connecting to a song and playing it together for the first time			0
" as soon as you realize you have something , you are aware that it can fall apart			0
" that same feeling of fragility does n't apply to the band , @entity19 said			1
during a long career , @entity1 has signed with different labels , seen members come and go and brought new ones aboard			2
and yet the band has remained true to the process , allowing members a level of success with " more opportunities and more time to play with , " @entity19 said			1
and if the ability to make a living touring and selling records went away , he said he 'd be just fine			0
" we did this to no reward for so long and were completely unconscious of that fact for so long			0
and we still got so much out of it , " he said .			0

@entity1 has recorded six albums and performed on " @entity14 " and " @entity15 "
" i feel like everything we 've done has been this slow burn , " says founding member @entity24
" we 've been doing it for a long time , " band co-founder @entity19 says
