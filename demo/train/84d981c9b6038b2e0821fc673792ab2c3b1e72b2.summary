-- there was a plane ticket from @entity3 , @entity4 , to @entity5 , @entity6 , with @entity8 's name on it			1
her parents bought it in the hope that @entity13 would be home for @entity15			0
they bought it as a leap of faith , hoping she would be legally vindicated of the allegation that she killed her roommate @entity21			1
they were tired of seeing their daughter 's name plastered across newspapers around the world with the word murderer alongside it			0
but the ticket was never used			0
in december 2009 , that ticket got shredded along with some of the hope her family was clinging to as she was hauled away as a convicted murderer from an @entity4 court			1
now , as closing arguments in @entity8 's appeal come to an end , one thing remains the same for the @entity13 parents : a plane ticket home			1
they just hope they 'll be able to use it this time			0
a fight to clear @entity8 's name in 2009 , @entity13 and @entity49 ( they divorced in 1989 ) boarded a plane to @entity4 for the verdict in their daughter 's murder trial			1
@entity56 pumped through their veins : a hope that an @entity4 court would see that their daughter was not a murderer			1
they were fighting a legal battle in which the odds were stacked unfairly against their daughter , according to many in @entity13 's camp			0
they were also fighting to preserve their daughter 's image by countering what they felt was an unfair media caricature of their daughter as " @entity8			1
" the nickname , her parents said , was given to her in school because of her soccer skills , but during the murder trial it became a nickname to portray her as a careless , sex - crazed party girl			1
her family told the story of an entirely different @entity8 : one who was " nonviolent " and " almost a passive person			1
" @entity8 : from @entity5 to @entity4 prosecutors alleged at trial that on the night of november 1 , 2007 , at a small house in the college town of @entity3 , @entity13 directed her then - boyfriend @entity90 and a third defendant @entity21 , to hold @entity92 down as @entity13 played with a knife before slashing @entity92 's throat			1
they said the trio left her in a pool of blood and covered her with her own blanket			0
@entity13 's parents , like her defense attorneys , said their daughter was not involved in the murder and that evidence presented at trial was thin and clouded by shoddy police work			1
but at the trial , those arguments fell on deaf ears			0
@entity13 was convicted along with @entity90 in the murder of @entity92 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively			1
@entity109 was convicted in a separate fast - track trial and is serving 16 years in prison			1
now , two years after @entity13 's conviction , @entity13 's parents are fighting a similar battle during her appeal			2
finding ' the truth ' of what happened in @entity3 inside the same @entity4 courtroom where @entity13 and @entity90 were convicted and sentenced , they now fight to try and prove the court got it all wrong			1
the dispute over forensic evidence has prompted many @entity13 supporters to question how the @entity4 court arrived at a conviction			1
gallery : a look at the evidence " from what we have heard ( about ) first trials here in @entity4 , a lot of it is related to emotion , " @entity13 told @entity0 earlier this month			1
and he , like many in the @entity13 camp , wonders why more was n't done to clarify facts about the evidence at trial in order to avoid his daughter being convicted and imprisoned for two years and 24 more to go			2
" when you look at the actual forensic evidence ( from the murder trial ) -- when you take a look at what the police were saying , which is literally 180 degrees different than what the defense was saying about the forensic evidence , and not have an independent review during the first trial , you can see how the result came out as is , " he said			2
disputed evidence at the heart of appeal attorneys for @entity13 and @entity90 , are appealing their convictions together since they were tried and convicted together			1
timeline of the @entity13 case an independent forensic investigation they fought for at trial could help overturn the convictions in the appeal , the attorneys said			2
during the murder trial , defense attorneys challenged key dna evidence found on the alleged murder weapon , a knife , and on @entity92 's bra clasp , arguing it had been contaminated after being left for weeks at the crime scene			1
. they asked for an independent examination of the evidence , but it was denied			2
during the appeals process the independent examination was allowed and has become the central issue of the appeal			2
at trial in 2009 prosecutors said there were traces of @entity13 's genetic material on the knife handle and traces of @entity92 's in a tiny groove on the blade			0
that dna was used to tie @entity13 to the crime scene during the murder trial , though defense attorneys argued there was barely enough dna to get an accurate reading			2
during the appeal , one of the independent forensic experts who studied the original evidence told the court that the dna alleged to be @entity92 's that was on the knife could not have been from blood			1
that key statement has led to a defense argument that there is now truly no official evidence that links @entity13 to the scene			0
the next battle in the appeal was to dismiss evidence that prosecutors said ties @entity90 to the murder scene			1
at trial , the prosecution said a bra clasp found on the bloodied crime scene floor had @entity90 's dna on it and proved he was in @entity92 's room when the murder occurred			2
defense attorneys argued the bra clasp had been left on the floor for nearly six weeks before it was collected and was likely contaminated			0
in the appeal , two independent forensic experts argued @entity226 allegedly found on the bra clasp should be " inadmissible " because the clasp had not been properly handled			0
prosecutors dismissed the theory again during the appeal , specifying it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene			0
they said documents showed that proper checks were carried out before and after their dna tests to verify the quality of the work			0
but the appeals judge could n't find the documents in court records and ruled they would not be admissible			0
the appeals judge denied prosecution efforts to introduce newly found records about the original testing and to hear a new witness -- all victories for @entity13 's defense , which opposed the motions			0
@entity13 said he feels there is " no case left " against his daughter			0
and that 's something he said his daughter is clinging to			0
will @entity13 return to prison -- or back home to @entity5 ? the dna evidence is the primary subject of closing arguments on both sides of the appeal			1
prosecutor @entity261 refuted the testimony from independent forensics experts that cast doubt on the reliability of the evidence , insisting police forensic officers had handled the dna material properly			2
she cast doubt on one of the expert who was a professor , rather than a professional in the field and said police had better experience when it came to processing the crime scene than an independent expert			0
the review had been " embarrassing , inappropriate , and presented in a hostile way " and was not based on science , she said			0
before asking the jurors to uphold the conviction she told them that the original court had concluded " beyond any reasonable doubt " that blood from both @entity13 and @entity92 found in the bathroom sink had been left there when @entity13 washed herself after the killing			2
prosecutor @entity292 , who investigated the original murder and defended the prosecution 's case in the appeal , urged the jurors to make their decision on the basis of what they had heard in court , not in the overwhelming media coverage			1
but @entity13 and @entity90 's defense teams are arguing the whole trial was based on dna evidence " on which mistakes were made , " and urged the jury to " abandon imagined fantasies " and acquit the pair			1
@entity90 's defense lawyer @entity311 also said during closing arguments to remember that the true evidence points to who they believe is the sole killer : @entity21			1
@entity109 , who was convicted earlier of the crime , has admitted being in the villa where @entity92 was killed , but has said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room during his trial			0
he later implicated @entity13 and @entity90			0
during his trial prosecutors introduced evidence that showed @entity109 's handprint in @entity92 's blood was found in the room along with his dna inside her body as well as on her clothing and on her purse			2
" the room speaks only of @entity333 , " @entity311 said during closing arguments			0
@entity311 also attacked the media portrayal of @entity13 as a " femme fatale , " which he said swayed the outcome of the trial			0
@entity13 's lawyer , @entity339 , said the court had already seen " there is not trace of @entity8 in the room where murder took place			1
" he told the jury based on the evidence " that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving @entity8			1
" speculation is rampant as to whether defense attorneys have cast doubt on the evidence that sent @entity90 and @entity13 to prison for murder			2
even the prosecutor 's office told @entity0 that its attorneys are less certain of the outcome this time			0
the prosecution is still confident that the verdict will be upheld , but is aware that it could go either way , the office said			0
" it really appears to me that they want to find the truth , " he said during the appeal			0
" i 'm very hopeful that by the end of the month , we 'll be able to bring @entity8 and @entity90 home			2

in 2009 , @entity8 and her then - boyfriend were convicted of the 2007 murder of @entity21
they are now appealing the conviction in the same @entity4 court
dna evidence is at the heart of the appeal
