-- @entity1 took time out from his off - season training regimen to answer questions on @entity4 from his legions of fans			1
among the things they learned earlier this month was that @entity1 's favorite fruits were strawberry , apple and mango and that he has visited 55 countries			2
when asked what he planned to get wife @entity15 , the funnier side of the 17 - time grand slam champion emerged : a " hashtag , " he replied			0
he added that he was " working overtime " to win the @entity21 in january -- which leads us to the first of five burning questions looking ahead to the 2014 tennis season			2
can @entity1 win another grand slam ? the numbers , so often in favor of history maker @entity1 , were less kind to the @entity31 in 2013			1
he failed to reach a grand slam final for the first time since 2002 , his grand slam quarterfinal streak ended at 36 and his year - end ranking of no. 6 was his lowest in 11 years			1
@entity1 only won one tournament , on grass in @entity38 , @entity39 -- though he was bounced from @entity40 a few weeks later in the second round after claiming the title at the @entity43 a record seven times			2
@entity46 coach @entity45 was axed months later			0
his back problems returned , with @entity1 saying it was a mistake to keep playing at the @entity49 in march when the back flared up			1
it was indeed a slump -- well , for @entity1			2
but @entity1 says he is now fit , which helped the 32 - year - old finish the season on a high			1
" my self - confidence has also returned , " he told the website of one of his sponsors , @entity58 , in late november			0
" by the end , everyone around me was talking positively again			0
the mood was much better than in the summer			0
" that boosts my morale for the coming year , and it 's a big relief			0
the fun has definitely returned			0
" @entity1 said he would like to win " about " five tournaments in 2014 and play in " great finals			1
" the majors are what matter to @entity1 most , and if he was to claim the @entity21 he would become the second oldest man -- behind @entity71 -- to bag a singles grand slam in the last 40 years			2
@entity1 probably needs to beat two of @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 to collect an 18th major but his recent record against the trio is underwhelming			1
he has lost four straight to @entity74 , three straight to @entity75 and fell to @entity76 in an absorbing @entity21 semifinal last january			2
no matter what happens to @entity1 in 2014 , though , he 'll still be a major talking point			1
can anyone stop @entity74 at the @entity83 ? statistically , @entity74 became the best player ever at the @entity83 when he won an unprecedented eighth title on the red clay at @entity83			0
only once has he failed to win in @entity87 in the spring , when @entity88 , @entity74 's wonky knees and the then split of the @entity91 's parents made for a combination too powerful to overcome in 2009			0
since then he has captured four in succession			0
but @entity74 came within an inch of likely losing at the @entity83 this year to @entity75			0
the @entity95 led by a break 4 - 3 in the fifth set of their semifinal when he touched the net before a point ended at deuce			0
it was an easy put away that @entity74 had no chance of reaching			0
@entity75 lost the point , @entity74 broke back and he won 9 - 7 in the fifth			2
only two months prior , @entity75 snapped @entity74 's 46 - match winning streak , dating back to 2005 , at the clay - court @entity108			2
if anyone is to get the better of @entity74 at the @entity83 next year -- assuming he is healthy -- @entity75 , who has appointed @entity110 as the head of his coaching team , is the lone serious candidate			0
who can derail @entity114 ? @entity114 compiled a 78 - 4 record in 2013 for the best winning percentage on the women 's tour since 1990 and she took home nearly $ 12.4 million in prize money -- the most ever for a female tennis player in a season			1
@entity114 was stunned by @entity123 at @entity40 in one of those four losses but weeks earlier lifted the @entity83 trophy for the first time since 2002			1
when she triumphed at the @entity129 in september , the @entity128 climbed to 17 majors to approach @entity131 -- once her critic -- and @entity133			1
unlike her fellow 32 - year - old @entity1 , @entity114 does n't have as many roadblocks in front of her so she could keep on collecting grand slam titles in bunches			1
world no. 2 @entity138 has yet to win a grand slam outside @entity141 and @entity142 is returning from another serious shoulder injury			2
they 're @entity114 ' two main rivals			2
@entity114 ' first order of business is to end @entity138 's two - tournament reign in @entity148 after injuries hampered her @entity150 in 2012 and this year			1
how will @entity76 recover from his back injury ? @entity76 missed the last two months of the season following back surgery and all eyes are on the @entity155 to see how he 'll rebound in 2014			1
as the likes of @entity1 , @entity71 and @entity76 's coach , @entity158 , can attest , back problems are difficult to shake			1
he is due to return to action at an exhibition tournament in @entity161 on @entity162 against @entity163 and might also face @entity75 and @entity74			0
" it 's exactly the test i need to see where my game is at , " @entity76 was quoted as saying by @entity164 online			0
thankfully for @entity76 he was able to end @entity169 's 77 - year wait for a men 's singles champion at @entity40 -- before the back forced him off tour -- when he toppled @entity75 in july			1
prior to @entity74 re-emerging on the circuit in february , @entity75 and @entity76 contested two straight grand slam finals			1
@entity76 wants to make more history , said mom @entity176			0
" @entity76 's goal is to win more grand slams and try to achieve that end - of - year world no. 1 ranking , " she was quoted as saying by the @entity178 newspaper this week			1
can anyone new win a major ? with the men 's @entity187 around , unearthing a new grand slam champion in 2014 figures to be difficult			1
since the spring of 2005 , only one man not named @entity1 , @entity74 , @entity75 or @entity76 has won a grand slam -- @entity191 at the @entity192			1
recent years , however , tell us it could happen on the women 's tour			0
for four straight seasons a debutante has come through at a major , @entity199 being the most recent at @entity40			0
@entity199 was the first to admit she benefited from a nice draw , with @entity114 , @entity142 and @entity138 all exiting before the quarterfinals .			0

@entity1 hopes to win " about five " tournaments in 2014 and play in " great " finals
the @entity31 ends 2013 at no. 6 , his lowest year - end ranking since 2002
@entity114 is one major short of tying @entity133 and @entity131
@entity76 returns to the pro circuit in 2014 after *undergoing* back surgery in september
