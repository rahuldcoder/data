-- @entity2 candidates who run from president @entity3 in red states where he is unpopular are making a big mistake			1
their holding @entity3 at arm 's length deprives voters of a clear choice at the ballot box			1
@entity12 secretary of state @entity13 is a great candidate for the @entity15 and is running a solid campaign			1
but she made a mistake when she refused to answer the question from the @entity20 about which presidential candidate she voted for in 2012			1
@entity13 should have said she voted for president @entity3 and then gone on to explain her policy differences with him			1
by ducking the question , all she did was make news out of her refusal to give a routine answer to a routine question			0
if @entity13 does n't care for @entity3 or what he stands for or has accomplished , just say so			1
like most democrats running this fall , @entity13 can not win the election without the support of the @entity2 base , and the @entity2 base expects her to vote for a @entity2 president against his @entity37 opponent			1
having forthrightly identified herself as a @entity39 , @entity13 can go on to explain what kind of @entity39 she is -- a @entity41 @entity39 , a moderate @entity39 , a @entity12 @entity39 , a @entity42 , or simply a woman who has shown voters that she is wise and if elected , will work hard to put their interest first -- not simply try to score partisan points			1
@entity13 is more than a match for incumbent sen. @entity48			0
she is every bit as tough as him , without his baggage of government shutdowns , his focus on making @entity3 a one - term president ( and failing at it ) , and his love of extreme partisan politics			2
she hit hard in the only debate of the race			0
" sen. @entity62 's 30 - year recordâ € ” it 's gridlock , it 's obstruction , it 's extreme partisanship that 's cost this nation a 16 - day government shutdown			0
we ca n't afford to go in that direction			0
my record speaks for itself			0
i 'm an independent thinker who does what 's right for the people of @entity12 , not partisan politics			2
" the best @entity62 seemed to be able to do was to mock her criticism of fabulous wealth : " let me tell you : her family has made more off the government in the last 10 years than i 've been paid in a salary in all my time in the @entity15 , " he said			2
ok , they are both wealthy , but what about the voters in @entity12			1
who 's looking out for them ? @entity62 , who is the self - acknowledged " @entity87 of @entity88 , " tried to make his gun - to - the - head negotiating ( my way , or i shove the @entity94 over the fiscal cliff ) appear as compromising			0
it did n't work , and that 's largely why he 's in trouble now			0
voters truly want to believe that candidates will attempt to find common ground			2
@entity13 , by contrast , forthrightly supported @entity104 and @entity12 's governor , calling him " heroic " for taking on @entity62 so @entity106 can have the financial security and health care they need			2
if there is one rule for @entity2 this year it is , " do n't demoralize and demobilize the @entity2 base			1
" she may , in fact , never tell anyone her ballot vote			0
but , @entity13 does herself , and her party , no good by sidestepping her party 's leader			0
by electing the libertarian @entity120 to the @entity15 and a @entity2 governor , @entity121 , who has implemented health care reform on the state level , @entity12 voters have proven that they are willing to elect politicians with a wide array of views			1
prior to the debate and @entity13 ' refusal to answer the question about who she voted for in the last presidential election , the polls have seesawed between @entity62 and @entity13 , but @entity62 never breaks 50 %			0
for an incumbent to be stuck below 50 % is a danger sign , and @entity48 is the ultimate incumbent -- a figure of @entity136 , not @entity12			2
if she is to survive the final weeks of campaigning , @entity13 must pivot back to the issues and perhaps even make some real news by saying what she will do for six years if elected versus trying to compete with @entity62 on what to do to stop president @entity3 from doing his job for two more years			0
@entity13 is 35 with a long career ahead of her			0
if she does n't win this time , does she want the @entity2 base to boycott her for decades to come ? @entity41 started in @entity146 as a supporter of @entity148 , proving that a progressive @entity39 can win in a conservative border state			1
she is a fiercely independent , tough candidate and is capable of providing a positive case for how she will lead			0
but it 's past time for @entity2 running in these so - called red states to positively make a case for voters to elect them based on their agenda and priorities -- and not get caught up in trying to play these distancing games that could alienate the base voters they need to turn out on @entity160 .			1

@entity2 candidate for @entity15 from @entity12 refused to say if she voted for @entity3
@entity164 : democrats who run from @entity3 may be taking a big risk
she says the @entity2 base voters are n't going to look kindly on *abandoning* @entity3
@entity164 : voters in @entity174 states will support candidates with progressive views
