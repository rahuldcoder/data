@entity0 , @entity1 -- ten days after four @entity4 were killed in their @entity1 city , hundreds marched in @entity0 and took over the headquarters of a radical @entity8 group tied to the attack			1
thousands of protesters had taken to the street earlier friday , loudly declaring that they -- and not those behind last week 's deadly attack -- represent the real sentiments of the @entity1 people			1
" i am sorry , @entity4 , " one man said			0
" this is the real @entity1			1
" in the evening , an offshoot of several hundred people then headed toward the headquarters for @entity20 , a loosely connected radical @entity8 group			1
as militia members fled , the protesters torched a vehicle and took over the group 's building without firing a single shot			1
some of those involved claimed to have freed at least 20 captives held inside , and expressed their intent to assume control over other @entity20 buildings			0
army general @entity32 said the citizens , whom he referred to as " revolutionaries of the february 17 uprising , " later asked that the @entity20 headquarters be handed over to the @entity1 army			1
" indeed , we rushed here and we will now take it over , " said the general			0
" there are also other places that we intend to take over ( which belong to armed groups ) if the revolutionaries and the people allow us to do so			0
" but some of the protesters gathered at locations that house forces loyal to the national authority , he said , including the headquarters of the @entity53 battalion			0
gunfire could be heard at the headquarters , but it was not initially clear who was responsible			0
@entity58 , president of @entity1 's @entity59 , thanked the protesters for helping evict " armed groups			1
he also said the @entity53 brigade was actually " under the command of -- and committed to -- the national authority , " the case appeared to be one of mistaken identity			0
@entity58 asked demonstrators to stop their activities and go home			0
there was widespread speculation that anti-national authority groups capitalized on the euphoria after the takeover of the @entity20 headquarters and pushed protesters to move toward locations under the control of the army and the police force			2
on the night of september 11 , @entity4 ambassador @entity82 was one of four @entity4 slain after a group assaulted the @entity4 @entity84 in the eastern @entity1 city			1
seen as the birthplace of the revolution that led to the death of longtime @entity1 leader @entity89 , @entity0 has in recent months been beset by security issues			2
initial reports indicated that , ahead of the consular attack , @entity20 had organized a protest to decry an inflammatory film that mocks the @entity95 and also protest the @entity4 , where the film was privately produced			2
on thursday , @entity1 prime minister @entity97 said eight detained in connection with that assault include members of @entity20 , though he added that not all the attackers came from one specific group			2
responding to the report from @entity0 , @entity4 sen. @entity103 applauded the citizens ' efforts friday and said it represented the true , freedom - loving @entity1 that he and other @entity4 officials involved in the country knew			1
" somewhere @entity82 is smiling , " the @entity111 @entity110 said			0
" this is what we knew ... about @entity1			0
