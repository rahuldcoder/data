@entity1 , @entity0 -- in 1968 the @entity4 team broke new ground			1
rather than racing in a livery related to national flags or emblems , the team took to the circuit with cars in the color - scheme -- and wearing the logo of -- @entity16 's @entity15 brand			0
@entity18 's helmet bears the " @entity19 " , symbol of @entity19 for nearly 100 years since then @entity4 and sponsorship have walked hand - in - hand , sponsorship money being a significant -- and in many case major -- source of revenue			1
but what do sponsors get out of @entity4 ? @entity19 , a scotch whisky brand of @entity30 , is in its third season of sponsoring the @entity33 team			1
@entity34 is @entity19 's @entity35 : " specifically for us we 're looking at doing two things			1
at a brand level we 're trying continually to develop the equity in our brand image			0
and that 's by getting involved with international , stylish events like @entity4			1
" and secondly it 's a fantastic vehicle for us to get our responsible drinking message across			0
when we went into @entity4 it was on those two bases			1
" @entity19 is the world 's best - selling @entity46 ( and the world 's second - best selling whisky after the @entity51 whiskey , @entity52 )			1
sold in 180 countries and consumed at a rate of 154 glasses per second ( or five bottles per second ; nearly 160 million bottles per annum ) , it is a truly global proposition			2
" you can imagine that when we wanted to get into a sponsorship property we needed something that gave us the global scale and global reach and @entity4 was really the only possible sporting event that we could get this reach , " continues @entity34 " it 's a huge annual event			1
" with such a global presence , @entity19 does n't need @entity4 to grab brand awareness			1
rather it piggybacks on @entity71 's appeal -- and the brand appeal of @entity33 in particular -- to position itself as a youthful and dynamic proposition			2
" in terms of which team you go for we analyzed the teams and there was really only one potentially for us to get involved with and that was @entity33 , " says @entity34 , " because we share so many similar characteristics			0
both our teams are successful			0
since they entered @entity4 1 , 41 years ago , no team has won more races than @entity33			1
" we 're the best and biggest global @entity46 player , we 've won more awards than any other scotch whisky			2
so there 's a similarity there			0
that fit of values -- these brands have a kind of status -- @entity33 , @entity33 , @entity19			1
" but it 's not just about presenting the brand			0
@entity4 offers @entity19 a chance to entertain its clients in a unique way			1
" @entity101 says that @entity4 is one of the last gladiatorial sports -- like chariot racing , " says @entity34 , " it 's exciting , it 's something you can get close to and experience in a really authentic way			1
and we found that it 's a great asset to our corporate entertaining calendar			0
" we tend to take customers from specific markets to specific races , both in seeing what the brand looks like at its best in a contemporary , fashionable , international setting such as @entity4 races are			1
be they in @entity122 , @entity123 or @entity124 , having deeper relationships with our customers is one of the benefits we get out of it			0
" @entity4 is n't @entity19 's only sporting sponsorship			1
it also sponsors golf -- a sport that -- @entity133 aside -- is rarely associated with youth and dynamism			0
but while its perception in @entity137 is one of " a walk in the country ruined " , in the @entity142 market it has the associated glamour and spirit of @entity4			1
the @entity19 classic has run in @entity142 for 17 years now and @entity19 also sponsors the championship at @entity147 in @entity148 ( @entity147 is also a @entity30 property )			2
@entity34 relates a piece of @entity147 trivia : its golf course was designed by a descendant of @entity19			2
key to the brand message that @entity19 -- and @entity30 -- is trying to get across is responsible drinking			2
@entity30 runs worldwide campaigns on this message , including the " @entity162 " campaign in the @entity159 and " @entity163 " campaign in @entity161			0
but are n't motor sports and drink strange bedfellows ? " responsible drinking and @entity4 : a lot of people say , can you explain that to me for a second ? " says @entity34 , " i 'm always delighted to answer that particular question because responsible drinking is a critical part of @entity30 's message			2
" the message has been reinforced by having formula @entity33 world champion , @entity176 , work as a taxi driver at various @entity179			0
" recently i happened to be in @entity122 with [ @entity176 ]			0
' why are you driving a taxi promoting responsible drinking ? ' people ask			0
the very fact that you 're putting that question into people 's minds is unbelievably powerful			0
" and then when you explain that a @entity4 driver is a great athlete who is in control , but that you can not be in control if you 're drinking and driving			2
it 's a powerful message that really resonates with consumers			0
" if governments do responsible drinking messages , it 's probably ignored to be honest , if companies do it , it 's less impactful			0
but @entity176 is still a hero amongst many young people it really does resonate with them and it changes their behavior and their attitude to something which is critical to @entity19 , to @entity30 and to me			1

@entity4 seen as a young and dynamic sponsorship opportunity
global reach of the sport is seen as an *advantage*
corporate *hospitality* helps @entity19 get closer to its customers
