-- automotive expert @entity1 answers a question about how to diagnose an exhaust problem and what to do about it			0
dear @entity1 , @entity6 is coming out of the tailpipe of my 2002 @entity8 with 90,000 miles			2
is this a big problem ? i have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine			2
what should i do ? -- @entity15 , @entity16 @entity15 , generally , engines burn oil due to a few reasons : bad valve seals , worn valve guides , pressurized crankcase ( oil pan ) due to a clogged @entity25 valve or breather system , and blow - by from worn piston rings			1
bad valve seals : the valves are located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber			1
oil is pumped at 40 to 80 @entity33 ( pounds / square inch ) of pressure into the top of the head , lubricating the valve - train			1
the valves have seals to stop the flow of oil down into the engine when the valve is open			1
if the seals fail then oil is allowed to flow down into the combustion chamber and is burned			1
worn valve guides : a small cylindrical chamber called a valve guide does just what its name says ... it guides the valves			1
these guides wear out over time causing eccentricity ( slop )			0
the excess gap that forms allows oil to flow down the valve stem into the combustion chamber to be burned			1
normally the valve seal stops this flow			0
however , in this case the gap is too great for the seal to work			0
@entity64 autos : should you use synthetic motor oil ? pressurized crankcase due to clogged pcv or breather system : your car 's engine is a giant air pump , consequently it must breathe			1
the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) system allows the engine to exhaust the excess pressure buildup ( which is a natural phenomenon of the internal combustion engine )			1
carbon is a by - product of an engine and can build up in the @entity25 system , clogging the breathing passages			1
this in turn pressurizes the oil pan and pushes oil up into the fuel delivery system where it is fed into the engine and burned			1
@entity64 autos : do i need to replace my air filter ? blow - by from worn piston rings : the pistons in your car 's engine have seals around them in the form of rings			1
these rings have two functions : ( 1 ) they seal the combustion chamber so that the power developed from the firing of the cylinder is not lost			1
( 2 ) they provide vital lubrication to the cylinder walls			0
when the rings wear out , the pressure from combustion reverses down into the oil pan , pressurizing it , and forcing oil into the valve covers			1
from there it goes through the breather system , back into the fuel delivery system , and into the engine to be burned			2
i have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine			2
is this a big problem ? it 's hard to say without performing some diagnostics on the engine			2
a quart of oil a week is excessive			0
it could be due to a plugged pcv or excessive internal engine wear			0
take the car into the shop for engine diagnostics			2
my guess is that the tech will perform a compression test along with a cylinder leak down test after he / she determines if the @entity25 system is open			2
during these tests the tech tries to determine if there is loss of engine compression , blow - by , or excessive oil consumption due to ring wear			1
if excessive ring wear is discovered then further engine teardown will be necessary to determine if the engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced			0
@entity64 autos : how often should you change your oil what is the difference between blue and white smoke ? the engine can emit different colors of smoke : blue smoke : @entity164 typically means that engine oil is being burned in the combustion chamber			1
in rare cases , when a vehicle is equipped with a transmission that uses a device called a vacuum modulator valve ( to soften shifts between gears according to engine vacuum ) the diaphragm can break inside the valve and cause transmission fluid to be sucked into the engine via the vacuum line feeding the valve and burn			0
@entity64 autos : fluid leaks : unsafe and expensive white smoke : @entity184 can mean one of two things			1
( 1 ) water condensation from a blown and leaking head gasket : this gasket is the seal between the cylinder head and engine block			1
water runs through channels called water jackets that line the cylinder walls and thus carry away heat			0
when the head gasket blows , the seal between the cylinder head and engine block breaks and water is allowed to enter the combustion chamber			1
this water is emitted from the engine in the form of water vapor or steam and it is white in color			2
( 2 ) excessive gas : fuel delivery systems sometimes falter and dump excessive amounts of raw fuel into the intake plenum			0
when this happens , the amount of fuel is too much for the engine to process			0
hence , it exits the engine and tailpipe in the form of pure white fuel vapor			2
it stinks like raw gas and can be dangerous if it ignites in the hot muffler and catalytic converter			0
i have witnessed exhaust systems literally blown off the vehicle from the explosion that ensued from ignition of a gas - filled catalytic converter			2
this condition must be fixed immediately to prevent internal engine damage or worse yet , a serious fire			0
can i add oil or coolant and keep driving the vehicle until i can afford to fix it ? yes			0
however , be advised that such maladies never get better by themselves ; and they always get worse with time			0
there is a real possibility that you will get caught on the road driving at highway speeds ( thinking you added enough oil , transmission fluid or engine coolant ) and the oil runs out , causing a catastrophic failure			0
in general , when it comes to a need for auto repair , conditions never improve on their own			0
you must maintain your vehicle if you want to get the maximum life out of it and , in the long run , spend the least amount of money			0
@entity64 autos : how to avoid common car problems			0

an oil - *thirsty* engine and smoke coming from car 's tailpipe are signs of trouble
bad valve seals or worn guides , clogged @entity25 valve , worn piston rings among causes
white smoke : water condensation from blown head gasket , too much gas
blue smoke : engine oil is being burned in the combustion chamber
