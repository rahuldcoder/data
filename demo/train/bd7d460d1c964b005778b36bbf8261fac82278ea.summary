-- as @entity3 openers go , this was about as bad as it gets for @entity5			2
thumped 4 - 0 by @entity7 , one key defender sent off , another possibly out of the tournament with injury and its @entity10 looking decidedly unfit			1
@entity12 star @entity11 was n't lacking in effort but was as powerless as those around him to prevent @entity5 being steamrollered by @entity15 in @entity16			1
it started badly for @entity19 's men and got steadily worse as @entity7 maintained its record of scoring at least four goals in every opening @entity3 match since 2002			1
latest @entity3 scores they were 1 - 0 down after 10 minutes when @entity25 was adjudged to have hauled down @entity26			1
fellow @entity28 star @entity27 confidently slotted home the penalty			2
it was 2 - 0 when @entity32 thumped a header into the net from @entity36 ' corner			1
just five minutes later , @entity12 defender @entity37 tangled with @entity27 , who sank theatrically to the turf claiming a hand to the face			1
@entity37 then stood over his opponent and pushed his head towards @entity27 's , the referee producing a straight red card			1
@entity27 then struck just before the interval to put the game well beyond @entity5 , pouncing on a loose ball inside the area to fire past @entity48			1
@entity5 made a change at the break , as @entity51 replaced @entity52 , but it made little difference as @entity7 continued to press home their advantage			2
@entity57 , who plays for @entity58 , should have found the net when played through on goal but he hit his shot straight at @entity48			0
with @entity37 already off the field , another @entity63 defender joined him -- this time through injury rather than red card -- when @entity67 pulled up with what looked like a hamstring injury and departed on a stretcher			1
@entity7 squandered several counter attacking opportunities before @entity27 completed a memorable hat - trick on 78 minutes , stabbing a shot into the net after @entity77 's cross had been parried by the goalkeeper			1
the 24 - year - old was top scorer at the last @entity3 in @entity81 , netting five goals in six games			0
he now has 20 goals in 50 internationals for @entity7			2
@entity11 nearly opened his @entity3 account in stoppage time but @entity88 saved brilliantly from his fierce free kick			0
" @entity93 was our only option and the team went out there with that in mind , " @entity7 coach @entity90 was quoted as saying by @entity92 's official website			0
" @entity27 ( @entity27 ) did really well in attack and created a lot of space for us			0
" @entity104 0 - 0 @entity103 meanwhile in @entity105 , @entity104 and @entity103 shared the first draw of the competition in @entity108			2
it was the 13th match of @entity110 2014 and it proved unlucky for football fans as it finished in a stalemate			0
both teams struggled to create goalscoring opportunities in a drab contest , although @entity104 missed a golden chance in the first half			0
@entity104 's first corner gave striker @entity119 the chance to open the scoring , but @entity103 goalkeeper @entity121 stretched to save his near - post header			0
@entity103 , crowned @entity124 champions in 2013 , were expected to win the game comfortably but the " @entity103 " failed to seriously threaten the @entity104 goal			0
the result leaves @entity129 top of the group after a 2 - 1 win over @entity132 on sunday			0
@entity104 faces @entity129 on saturday in @entity133 , while @entity103 travels to @entity134 to play @entity132 .			0

@entity7 thump 10 - *man* @entity5 4 - 0 in its opening match in @entity138
a hat - trick from @entity141 and another from @entity32 settle matters
@entity5 and @entity12 defender @entity37 sent off after clash with @entity27
@entity67 pulls up with an injury that could rule him out of tournament
