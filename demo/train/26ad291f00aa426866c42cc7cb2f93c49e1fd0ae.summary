-- @entity1 , the @entity2 for the @entity4 vice presidentâ € ” and lightning rod in the group 's public relations storm over @entity9 funding -- stepped down from her position tuesday			1
for many it was almost a satisfying ending to an eye - opening incident			0
none of it should have come as a shock			0
when the @entity2 foundation last week bowed to pressure from anti-abortion activists to stop most of its funding of @entity9 , the furor was swift and forceful			1
@entity2 's decision was frequently described in the media and in the online outcry as a " betrayal " â € ” of its mission , of the millions of @entity27 who run in its @entity2 every year , and of the women whom @entity2 and @entity9 serve			1
but to people familiar with the foundation , the decision was hardly a surprise			2
under the perky pink ribbon at the center of @entity2 's brand lies a distinctly conservative orientation shaped over three decades by the foundation 's political and corporate alliances			1
despite its carefully cultivated nonpartisan image , the foundation 's connections to the @entity43 are deep and longstanding			0
@entity45 , @entity2 's founder , has raised thousands of dollars for the @entity43 over the years and was rewarded when president @entity46 named her ambassador to @entity48 in 2001			1
last year 's hiring of @entity50 , an anti-abortion @entity43 , to head @entity2 's public policy efforts was not a sudden swing to the right , as some commentators have implied			1
beyond this , even a cursory glance at the group 's corporate partners could help explain why so much of its funding goes to detection and treatment			1
in interviews , @entity2 executives have denied that their corporate funders exert any influence over their policy decisions			1
but an organization that takes money from the chemical and energy industries , fast food companies , and cosmetics manufacturers is unlikely to fund research on environmental toxins or pursue other prevention - oriented concerns			1
and , for the most part , @entity2 does n't			1
instead , the foundation focuses on early detection through mammography -- an imperfect tool -- and fundraising for treatment - oriented research , which has produced little in the way of concrete results			0
people with breast cancer have essentially the same options as they did half a century ago : surgery , chemotherapy and radiation			0
while their chances of dying from the disease have improved very slightly in recent years , breast cancer incidence rose steeply over the course of the 20th century to one in eight today			0
@entity2 is hardly the only case of a foundation held sway by political and corporate interests			1
philanthropy is political ; it always has been			0
like public funds raised through taxation , decisions about how to spend money generated through charitable giving are controversial and subject to partisanship			0
we might prefer to think of charity rising above the political fray , but in reality it is an extension of it			0
nor does charity escape the pressures of the market			0
it is common practice for large foundations to enter into partnerships with corporations , to spend large sums on marketing and public relations , and to tailor their brands to what consumers want rather than their official missions			0
@entity2 has been incredibly successful in promoting its brand of breast - cancer awareness , but not without setbacks			1
it has had a rough two years in this respect			0
its 2010 " @entity136 for the @entity4 " partnership with @entity138 raised concern among nutritionists and other health advocates about promoting junk food in the name of breast health			0
a year later , a @entity140 article reported that @entity2 devotes considerable time and money to suing small charities who use " for the cure " -- a @entity2 trademark -- in their fundraising			2
the small media storm had barely faded when critics began raising concerns about @entity2 's @entity152 perfume , which was produced in partnership with a @entity155 company that makes a sizable donation to the foundation			2
the breast cancer activist group @entity159 , said a chemical study it conducted revealed that the perfume contained toxic and hazardous ingredients			2
the @entity2 foundation said it is reformulating the perfume			2
then came the news about @entity9			0
last week , many of @entity2 's most faithful supporters took the lessons they had learned from the foundation about self - empowerment and put them to work			1
the groundswell of concern about @entity2 's funding policies is testament not only to the strength of pro-choice sentiment but to the success of the foundation in building a movement of women who are prepared to advocate for their own and others ' health			1
herein lies the promise of this moment			0
by harnessing the considerable financial and social loyalty it has built over the years , the @entity2 has an opportunity to do much more than reverse one small , but significant funding decision ; they could take the lead in constructing a radically different approach to the breast cancer epidemic			1
this new approach would prioritize not political interests or corporate sponsors , but women 's health			0
along the way , it might also bring us closer to realizing the @entity2 's vision of a " world without breast cancer			2
" follow @entity200 on @entity201 join the conversation on @entity203 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 says tumult over @entity2 funding not a surprise : foundations are political
she says @entity2 has long been *rightward* leaning , focused on treatment , not causes
she asks : group takes funds from chemical companies ; does that *discourage* focus on toxins ?
@entity206 : @entity2 should use loyalty shown in supporters ' dismay over funding to *redirect* priorities
