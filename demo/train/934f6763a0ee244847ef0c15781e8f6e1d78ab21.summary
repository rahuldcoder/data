-- it was a joyous day for @entity2 when she received her acceptance letter from @entity4			2
like most prospective students , she wanted to know exactly what she was getting into before she made her decision between schools			0
the shiny pamphlets were all fine , but @entity2 really needed to hear more about the school from the students			0
so she went to the @entity12 to get her answers			0
there she came across student - produced videos and blog entries , along with posts in a @entity20 group for accepted students			1
" there were all these kids that were so passionate about sharing their experience , " @entity2 said			0
" it was then that going off to @entity4 became a no - brainer , because i had already fallen in love with the school			0
" @entity2 , who is now a sophomore , was so impressed by the originality of the student content online that she eventually became a contributor to a student - run social media site , @entity35			1
the site features regularly updated blogs , videos and @entity39 feeds , all produced by current students for prospective and admitted students			1
@entity43 , the associate director of admissions and one of the people behind @entity35 , believes that it provides an uncensored look at the school			0
" you definitely take a leap of faith when you put this much control of your message in the students ' hands , " he said			0
" but the students feel a sense of pride that they are part of this process			0
" for universities competing to attract top students , it 's no longer enough to have a glossy brochure and a sleek website			2
schools like @entity4 are reaching out to engage with applicants on @entity20 and @entity39			1
they 're also finding that a robust social media campaign , along with such creative features as student - run blogs , can lure prospective students while a stale online presence can turn them off			1
college admissions officers are indeed learning to interact with students where they hang out : online			0
according to a recent study by the @entity77 at the @entity78 , 100 % of universities surveyed use social media to communicate with students , up from 61 % in 2007 - 08			1
the study found that 98 % of the responding colleges have a @entity20 page and 84 % have a @entity39 account			1
" social media is past the fad phase , " said @entity85 , director of the center			1
" the numbers speak for themselves			0
many students ca n't afford to visit the campus , so they are depending on the podcasts and blogs to get answers			0
" top social media colleges when @entity97 , a @entity98 senior , was applying to colleges , she was still receiving the traditional brochures			1
if she had the option of social media , she said , she would have learned more about the schools much faster			1
" i think the younger generation has grown up with social media , " @entity97 said			1
" it 's something , like electricity , they expect it to exist			0
" @entity110 , editor - in - chief of @entity111 , also noticed this reliance on social media when students in a focus group made it clear that university catalogs did not always impress them			1
" students view the brochures similarly to school propaganda , " he said			0
" there 's an aversion among them to the glossy versions that colleges put out			2
" @entity110 said that applicants often turn to the @entity12 to talk with enrolled students about their experiences			2
" they can get a sense of what life is really like on campus through social media , whether it 's through a virtual tour or @entity39 , " he said			1
@entity110 has come up with a ranking system , @entity111 's " @entity139 , " which classifies the universities on how well they use social media			1
as subjective as it may seem , the list , which was updated last month , is compiled based on a formula that requires at least 500 @entity20 " likes " and a @entity39 account for a school to be eligible			1
@entity110 said the ranking takes into account factors such as enrollment size , hours between tweets and responses to posts			1
anyone browsing the @entity139 list will notice a surprising trend : it 's not the @entity156 that rules the roost			0
among the top 10 schools are the @entity159 , @entity160 and the @entity161 at @entity161			0
although @entity163 , where @entity164 launched @entity20 as a student , topped the list when it launched in march , it was soon dethroned by @entity4			1
what colleges do right , and do wrong in their attempts to stand out , some universities on @entity111 's list have gone far beyond just having a @entity20 page			1
the chairman of the math department at @entity174 made a calculus music video with his students , who sing about derivatives in a @entity180 video titled " the @entity181			0
" the sixth - ranked @entity182 created a campaign around the school 's colors of blue and white and a site , @entity186 , that includes videos from students and staff			0
many top schools also make creative use of @entity39 to communicate with students			1
the @entity182 recently sent out tweets to some of its accepted students saying , " congrats and welcome to our @entity199 family			2
" @entity200 keeps its students updated on student affairs through its @entity39 account			1
and the admissions office of @entity205 has a @entity39 account that messages applicants about interview weekends and decision dates			1
but other universities are still slow to catch on			2
while @entity213 regularly tweets updates through its @entity216 account , its main @entity212 account has n't been updated since september 2009			1
and it 's not the only one			0
some universities neglect their websites , tweet too infrequently or fail to reply to student questions			1
" it 's not enough to be satisfied that your school is on @entity20 , " @entity85 said			2
" students will make a judgment about the university if it is not current and responsive online			2
when their post does n't get answered , they are not interested anymore			0
" @entity229 , a @entity230 senior , said he finds it annoying that many colleges do not use @entity39 effectively			1
" why have a @entity39 account if you only have four tweets in the past few months ? " he said			1
" also , colleges sometimes do n't understand the difference between @entity20 and @entity39			1
sometimes they tweet clones of @entity20 posts			2
" @entity241 , a @entity242 senior , said the kind of language used in social media is important to her			1
she has seen some universities tweet archaic words such as " groovy , " which can be off - putting			2
" it 's like reading a text message from my mom , " she said			0
" it screams that ' i did n't do my research and i do n't know my target audience			0
' " engagement is key there is no one recipe for success when it comes to colleges ' use of digital media			2
@entity110 believes universities should invite students to produce online content			2
he cited @entity161 , which uploaded a video montage of its band 's drum section performing @entity271 's " @entity270			0
" " it shows a personality to the school that i would have never seen before , " @entity110 said			0
" they are having a good time , and i loved it			0
that 's what makes it special			0
" @entity85 thinks universities should avoid content on social media that presents a bland , pristine image of the school			1
" @entity286 people should not be doing these blogs			0
students have an antenna for that , " she said			0
" if you try to sanitize your blog , students will see right through that			0
" finally , it 's not enough just to have unique online features			0
without attempts to interact with students , universities ' fancy graphics or slick videos are good for nothing , @entity110 said			2
" you can have an awesome page and gorgeous features , but you need to have real engagement , " he said			2
" it makes us feel that the school really does care about its students			0
" @entity110 believes universities should think about what their focus is and what they want students to see when they @entity319 the school			2
" a successful social media campaign is when students are able to have a one - to - one connection , speak directly to the school and get interesting information that they never knew before , " he said .			1
