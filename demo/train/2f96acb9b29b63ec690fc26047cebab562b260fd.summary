-- " @entity1 , " the latest installment in the action - horror series , aims higher than your typical first - person shooter game			1
it boasts cool combat features , a spooky paranormal story line and some dramatic tension			1
but because its emphasis is on combat , not thrills , the game is not nearly as scary as it should be			1
" @entity1 " ( @entity22 , @entity23 ) continues its franchise 's story of a family in conflict as two brothers work together to track down their psychically enhanced mother , @entity20 , who is about to give birth			1
however , their reasons for wanting to find dear @entity25 are totally opposite			1
filmmaker @entity26 , director of the classic fright flick " @entity28 , " helped create cinematics for the game that heighten its fear factor			2
comic book horror writer @entity32 co-wrote the story line			2
co-op mode is the preferred mode of play here , allowing you to take advantage of each brother 's skills during combat and strive toward the highest score on each level			0
you can play as @entity44 , who is well versed in military training and technique , or as @entity47 , who was slain during the original " @entity1 " but returns here as a ghost with psychic energy powers			1
the brothers must navigate wave after wave of soldiers , whacked - out cultists and creepy creatures created from @entity20 's mind			1
the battlefields range from a looted food warehouse to the science bunker where @entity20 is being held			0
while the action is pretty linear , there are detours in which you can search for hidden weapons and ammo , psychic link gathering locations , and an @entity20 doll , which scores big points when found			0
there are enemies who require some extra work to defeat , including one called a @entity73 , who summons additional soldiers over and over			2
it is easy to get immersed in the run - and - gun aspects of " @entity1 , " but keep in mind that it 's also supposed to be a horror game			1
remember , @entity25 is a psychic time bomb allegedly waiting to erupt when she gives birth to ... whatever			0
to be sure , there are some very good horror moments in the game			2
the apparitions that briefly appear , scare and disappear are disconcerting			0
and having a ghost brother along during solo mode is a constant reminder			0
when they occur , the terror elements are jump - out - of - your - seat frightening			0
it is almost like watching a horror movie from the eyes of the lead actor			0
the problem is those moments do n't seem to occur as often as you 'd think or hope			2
there were plenty of times in the game where i forgot it was supposed to be a thriller and not just a shooter			1
some levels ' features are so combat - heavy that there 's no room for any memorable paranormal experiences			0
early in the game i was peeking around every corner expecting to find some apparition or twisted scene , only to shrug and move on			1
by the end of the game , i stopped looking for ghosts and just treated everything as a combat scene			2
multiplayer modes help make the game fun to replay			2
you can work together with your teammates to survive waves of enemies emerging from an advancing fog , or be possessed by @entity20 and try to take over your former teammates			0
" @entity1 " is a well - made first - person shooter that will challenge players with intelligent enemies and compelling battles			1
sadly , the frights are n't quite as jarring as they could have been			1
which , i 'm sure , makes the ghosts very sad			0
" @entity1 " is playable on the pc , @entity138 , and @entity139			1
it is available now in @entity141 , @entity142 and the @entity143			0
the game is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence , partial nudity and strong language			0
this review was done after playing the @entity139 version .			0

" @entity1 " aims higher than your typical shooter game , with some dramatic tension
the game is the story of two brothers trying to find their mother
the brothers must wade through wave after wave of soldiers and whacked out cultists
sadly , the frights are n't quite as jarring as they could have been
