-- not everyone will remember " @entity6 , " the 2006 movie that included a controversial scene in which president @entity4 was killed by a sniper			1
( i , on the other hand , ca n't forget it because my @entity10 is an actress and had a big role in that movie )			1
another thing i ca n't forget is the outrage that @entity15 sparked among some conservative commentators , including some of those very same people who are now defending @entity19 's film " @entity23 , " about the assassination of @entity22 leader @entity21			1
" @entity6 " won an award at the prestigious @entity25 and was slated to play in several theater chains in @entity27			1
that is , until some on the right went ballistic over it			1
@entity32 slammed the movie , reportedly calling the film 's director a " sicko " and saying the movie was part of an " age of insanity			1
" @entity42 ' @entity41 denounced the film in an article she penned for the conservative website , " @entity46 " titled , " @entity47			1
" @entity48 used the word " shock " ( all in caps ) to describe the film on the front page of his @entity53			2
and @entity54 grilled the film 's director on his @entity42 show with questions like " do you not have a responsibility to think of the impact , the impressions that could be made on people " by depicting the shooting of @entity4 ? the outrage was n't confined to the media			1
rep. @entity66 , then chairman of the @entity67 , dubbed the film disgusting , claimed it " could incite real violence " and reportedly warned that the filmmakers " would have blood on their hands if anything should ever happen			2
" @entity66 went on to call for no movie theater or tv network in @entity27 to show the film : " any theater that would show this , any tv station that would show this , is acting irresponsibly			1
it would be a disgrace for it to be shown anywhere			2
" in response to this outrage , the film was indeed pulled from the big theater chains and relegated to a handful of art house theaters			1
as a then - spokesperson for @entity91 , one of the movie theater chains that caved into the pressure , reportedly stated , " we do not feel it is appropriate to portray the future assassination of a president , therefore we do not intend to program this film at any of our cinemas			1
" yet fast forward to 2014 , and @entity53 reads , " surrender : @entity19 pulls ' interview			2
" ( apparently @entity48 's computer is stuck in " caps lock " mode			2
) @entity41 's @entity106 feed , meanwhile , is filled with retweets that denounce @entity19 's puling of the film			2
but the award for the biggest flip - flopper of them all goes to @entity66			2
the man who in 2006 called for theaters to not screen the film that portrayed @entity4 being assassinated sang a far different tune when interviewed earlier this week by @entity0 's @entity116			0
when @entity116 asked @entity66 if it was appropriate for a film to depict a world leader being assassinated , @entity66 responded , " there 's no reason not to do it			0
" @entity66 went on to state -- as if he had no recollection of what he said in 2006 -- that there have " been terrible things said about our presidents and our leaders in movies			0
... this is something that , in a free society , we tolerate			0
" look , if you are going to credibly defend freedom of expression , it requires that you be consistent			0
you ca n't just defend the words or images you agree with			0
that 's not how freedom of expression works			0
and deep down , i know that @entity66 and the pundits on the right know this			0
but too often they are playing to their political base or the consumers of their media outlets at the expense of intellectual honesty			0
( and to be candid , some on the left are just as guilty , though typically not in the area of freedom of expression			0
) will the future bring any changes ? tough to say , although to be honest it seems unlikely			0
it 's how some of them remain in office and attract fans to their websites and tv shows			0
but thanks to a thing called @entity171 we can discover in a matter of minutes the selective outrage and outright hypocrisy of these people			1
at least then we can dismiss their words as being nothing more than hollow pandering .			0

@entity181 : conservatives were outraged by " @entity6 "
but *similarly* themed movie is defended by right now , he says
@entity181 : thanks to @entity171 we can discover selective outrage
