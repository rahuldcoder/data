former cia director @entity0 is expected to tell @entity2 and @entity3 committees friday that soon after the attack on the @entity6 @entity5 in @entity7 , @entity8 , it suspected @entity9 was responsible			1
but just what is @entity9 , and why was n't it identified as a prime suspect two months ago ? there is no easy answer			1
@entity9 is more a label than an organization , one that 's been adopted by conservative @entity19 groups across the @entity21 world			1
the name means , simply , " @entity23			0
" in @entity7 , @entity9 was one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of @entity29			1
its members guarded the @entity32 hospital in @entity33 , where a number of the war 's wounded were treated			0
for a while , the group provided security at the airport , according to @entity40 , a senior fellow at the @entity41 in @entity42 who has closely followed the evolution of the @entity8 brigades			1
@entity9 took over a security building in @entity33 following @entity29 's ouster and came up with a logo -- a pair of @entity49 , a clenched first and an open @entity51			1
the group 's central belief is that all authority is derived from the @entity55 , that democracy is un-islamic and that other branches of @entity58 , such as the @entity59 , are heretical			2
@entity9 and members of another brigade , dubbed the @entity8 shield , have been accused of destroying @entity59 shrines near @entity7 days before the attack on the consulate			1
the description on the @entity68 feed of @entity9 of @entity7 proclaims : " the goals of @entity9 brigade is to implement the laws of @entity72 on the land , and reject the human implemented laws and earthly made constitutions			2
there will be nothing ruling in this country other than the laws of @entity72			0
" as with many of the brigades that roam @entity8 , @entity9 in @entity7 appears to have a fluid membership in the low - hundreds but some identifiable leaders , who have denied the group had any part in the consulate attack			1
in @entity7 , the membership includes @entity89 and @entity90 , its religious authority			0
@entity93 -- who fought to overthrow @entity29 -- has given a number of interviews since the september 11 attack on the consulate			2
in a @entity101 interview a week after attack , @entity89 denied @entity9 had any role in the attack , but said the group would not give up its weapons			1
" we are in a battle with the liberals , the secularists and the remnants of @entity29 , " he told the @entity101			0
@entity111 told @entity112 the attack was wrong			2
" the killing of the ambassador was not intentional â€” he died as a result of suffocation , " he told @entity114 in a telephone interview			0
he also said that just because the assailants carried the black flag often associated with @entity19 groups , it did not mean @entity9 was responsible			2
a @entity125 analysis of photographs of a large @entity128 parade in @entity7 in june -- and similar shows of strength elsewhere -- indicates the flag is widely used by @entity8 @entity128 militia			2
another prominent @entity9 figure is former @entity135 detainee @entity134			1
but his " patch " is east of @entity7 , near the town of @entity137			0
in the wake of the september 11 consulate attack , the 53 - year old bin @entity134 is thought by analysts to have left the area for a hide - out in the nearby coastal mountain range			1
@entity111 told @entity112 that the @entity7 group had nothing to do with him			2
@entity40 , himself a former @entity8 jihadist , thinks that blaming @entity9 for the attack oversimplifies the situation			1
he told @entity125 in september that its loose structure made it easy for any group with a terror agenda to infiltrate it because of a shared ideology			0
one such group , @entity40 said , was the @entity158 , named for the blind @entity159 @entity90 imprisoned in the @entity6 for his role in the 1993 attack on the @entity162			1
the group claimed responsibility for a crude @entity166 attack on the @entity7 consulate in june			1
there does not appear to be organizational links between @entity9 and @entity170 , but there is solidarity			2
@entity93 praised @entity170 leader @entity173 in his @entity101 interview , and said @entity170 's statements " help galvanize the @entity176 nation , maintain its dignity and pride			0
" @entity40 said most people in @entity7 have little time for the @entity128 brigades , as evidenced by the crowd of thousands who attacked @entity9 's headquarters in the days following the consulate attack			1
but he says their animosity was less ideological than borne of frustration			0
" they felt the attack on consulate was a threat to their well - being			2
for many of the protestors , it 's an opportunity to help the government make serious decisions to boost security in @entity7 , " he said			0
@entity6 unsure of @entity202 role the narrative from @entity6 officials -- on the record and off -- about who was responsible for the consulate attack in @entity7 has been , at best , confusing			1
in part , that 's because of the blurred lines and overlapping memberships of the different militia			0
on the day of the attack , a @entity6 diplomatic cable sent from @entity7 described a meeting of several brigade commanders with @entity6 officials two days earlier			0
according to the cable , during the meeting @entity8 @entity223 commander @entity230 and another @entity128 militia leader " discussed the very fluid relationships and blurry lines they say define membership in the @entity7 based brigades under the february 17 , @entity223 , and @entity224 [ @entity222 , a @entity8 government created fighting outfit ] umbrellas			2
" @entity230 and the other militia leader described themselves as members of multiple brigades , the cable said			0
then there are the conflicting reports from @entity6 officials			0
on september 18th , a @entity6 official told @entity125 that @entity9 had not been positively identified as responsible for the attack , " which is more likely to turn out to be a bunch of various elements and basically ( @entity170 ) militants			1
" another senior official told @entity125 : " @entity9 is only one of the elements they are looking at			2
the notion that the intelligence community has zeroed in on either @entity9 -- its leader @entity134 in particular -- is completely untrue			1
" at the same time , @entity249 , director of the @entity250 , told a congressional panel : " we are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to @entity170 or @entity170 's affiliates -- in particular , @entity258			0
" the possibility that @entity258 was somehow involved in the attack was recently revived by @entity261			0
gen. @entity262 , commander of the @entity263			0
" it appears to me very likely that some of the terrorists who participated in the attack in @entity7 have at least some linkages to @entity258 , " @entity262 told reporters in @entity265 this week			0
at other times @entity6 officials have suggested that @entity8 jihadists who fought with @entity170 in @entity272 played a role along with @entity159 militants			1
@entity275 is known about who @entity8 authorities detained in the wake of the consulate attack , and whether they are still detained			1
a @entity280 , meanwhile , has been detained in connection with the attack , though nothing is known publicly about his links to @entity9			1
@entity285 was arrested in @entity286 and is now being held in @entity287			0
what can be said with some confidence is that the @entity19 trend has been revitalized across the @entity21 world as dictatorships have crumbled			0
a number of @entity9 groups have emerged not only in @entity8 but in @entity295 , @entity280 , @entity159 and @entity296			1
" the @entity176 today are not like they were before , " @entity90 told the @entity101			0
" they can not stand any action that would insult our prophet or other symbols			0

@entity9 is one of a *handful* of militias operating in @entity8
@entity9 serves more as a label than an organized group
its identifiable leaders are @entity309 and @entity134
both have denied the group had any role in the consulate attack
