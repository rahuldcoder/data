@entity0 -- @entity2 , thwack , thwack			1
the sound of a hoe hitting the earth breaks the silence of a cold , crisp @entity0 early spring morning			1
wearing a brightly colored , tribal patterned piece of material as a skirt over her pants , @entity13 works hard turning the soil over in preparation for seeds			0
her worn hands grip the hoe with ease , the thwacking noise rhythmic			0
slowly , other women start to join her			2
they 're bundled up against the cold but still make a point to sing out to each other in greeting			0
a child 's runny nose is tended to and then he 's left to play			2
the women are farming a piece of land in the unlikely location of @entity0			1
they 're planting spinach and beets and carrots in anticipation of a late spring harvest			0
it 's work they 're familiar with , work they 're good at			2
see , these women are n't originally from @entity0			1
they 're refugees from @entity42			1
@entity42 is a small @entity43 country that shares a border with @entity45 to its north and the @entity47 to the west			1
no stranger to political instability and unrest , @entity42 started out as a monarchy though was later colonized by the @entity53			1
@entity54 came in 1962 , but damage to the relationship between the country 's two main tribes , the @entity55 and the @entity56 , had already been done			2
one coup after another eventually led to military rule			0
a captain and a colonel later , @entity64 found themselves without a constitution or opposition parties			0
tensions between the ruling @entity56 and majority @entity55 grew and grew until another all - too - familiar wave of violence broke out in 1988			2
it 's estimated that 150,000 @entity64 were killed , and tens of thousands sought refuge			2
@entity42 briefly looked to be back on track a few years later , but after the country 's first @entity55 president was assassinated , the nation was rocked by civil war			1
all this happened before the @entity64 and @entity45 presidents were killed in a plane crash april 1994			0
that crash marked the beginning of the better - known @entity45 genocide and only served to exacerbate the tensions in @entity42			1
it was n't until a cease - fire was negotiated in 2006 that @entity64 could exhale			2
and while the situation still is n't fully resolved , the violence has for the most part stopped			0
waves of @entity64 came to the @entity94 during that turbulent time			0
@entity0 was a popular destination for them because the city is constantly growing , and it was looking to diversify the population			1
for the refugees , escaping war was only the beginning			1
transplanted into a world that looked different , smelled different and spoke an entirely different language meant many challenges			0
in @entity64 culture , the women are responsible for farm work			2
without knowing @entity108 , many struggled to find a way to fit in , let alone provide for their families			0
@entity111 co-opts first woman from @entity42 to its executive committee a guiding light for the women for these 15 refugees , @entity116 changed all that			1
a former immigration lawyer , @entity116 knows how hard it can be just to get to the @entity94			1
she wanted to take her love of gardening and combine it with her passion for those in need			0
she gave up her well - paying job and started @entity127 , an organization that offers refugees a second chance at a new life			1
@entity127 operates a few farms and farming programs , but the @entity42 is just for @entity64 refugees			1
@entity13 is the de facto leader of the group			0
she 's been farming since she was a little girl			1
when she came to @entity94 after fleeing @entity42 , she had no means of income			1
she could n't speak or read @entity108 , and had a hard time navigating her new city			2
now , she can take the local rail transportation and read which spot she needs to get off			0
her @entity108 is n't fantastic , and she still needs a translator to explain some larger concepts , but you can tell from the way her eyes soften when she smiles that she 's happy			2
originally the garden intended to give the @entity64 women a chance to do at which something they 're good , to empower them and perhaps the chance to take something home to their families			1
it 's since evolved into a means for the women to make money			1
they now sell whatever they do n't take home at farmers ' markets			1
this year , they also started a @entity165 program , or @entity165			2
members of the community pay a fixed sum and get roughly 12 weeks worth of vegetables from the farm			0
they get whatever comes out of the ground that morning , and the women wash and sort the veggies with care			2
because the @entity165 members come and pick up their weekly allotment from the garden in person , they get to meet some of the @entity64 women			2
" i like the concept , " says @entity165 member @entity180 , " i know some of the folks who work here , and they bring with them skills from @entity42 that they 're able to use in this , and it feels good to see them be able to continue with what they were doing there to do it here			1
... i think plants reflect better taste when they 're raised with love			0
" for @entity13 , the relationship is mutually beneficial			0
through a translator , she says , " if you are working , then ... you are going [ to feel ] very better , but if you 're going to sleep in , you 're going to [ get ] in trouble			0
" she means the garden gives her a purpose in life , that she 's not just sitting at home doing nothing all day			1
her goal for the farm is for it to become big enough " to produce the things that are going to help our family or to help grow up our kids			0
" @entity42 faces growing unrest another harvest from garden : leadership @entity116 's role is more as a coordinator , making sure the garden is permitted correctly and handling the administrative tasks			1
the rest is run by the women			1
she 's noticed some residual benefits of the garden as well			2
" there 's really a leadership process that has evolved , " she says , " we have regular team meetings with the women who are in the leadership of the farm and we look at what has been successful selling at the market and we also look at what are some of the crops , the food that the women want for their own homes that they ca n't typically get in the marketplace here			1
so we do a combination of growing things that are harder to find in the markets like @entity43 greens ... and then also growing for markets			2
" the women are also responsible for deciding what farming techniques to use			1
they often plant two beds of the same crop , to see which one does better			0
they 're used to a less - structured growing approach			0
seeds are scattered over an area , as opposed to being planted in rows			0
they 've recently expanded their growing space so they have more room for muchicha , an amaranth green prominent in @entity42			1
when they first picked out what they 'd grow , a language barrier caused some confusion			0
the women saw a picture in a seed catalog of what they thought was muchicha ; turns out it was basil			0
the women 's approach to their crops is also commendable			1
they use as much of the plants as they can ; even taking bean leaves to prepare at home like spinach			0
as she reflects on the garden , and how far it 's come , @entity116 says " probably the biggest thing i 've learned is how incredibly important it is for human beings to have something they can take ownership of and feel strongly about			1
... and with that also comes a tremendous amount of confidence and really a comfort level of being in this country , having an opportunity to share it with their children			0
... it 's been really amazing to see that grow because it tells the story of people getting a chance to do something that 's good for them and good for their families , but really is central to who they are and it makes people so much stronger			0
" stronger , more empowered and happier			0
they may not be in @entity42 , but @entity127 is providing these women with more than just the ability to farm			1
they 're integrating them into a community so that one day , maybe they 'll feel like they 're home			0
rescued refugee becomes @entity314 rescuer			0

fifteen women who fled war - torn @entity42 are farming in metro @entity0
@entity116 started @entity127 to help refugees adapt to their new city
the women take some crops home and sell the rest at farmers ' markets
@entity116 : it 's important to have something of which they can take ownership
