-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 rode into the @entity4 retreat in @entity5 , @entity6 , ready to offer a dose of tough medicine for the @entity9 , which he now says " must stop being the stupid party			1
" " the @entity9 does not need to change our principles , " he said in a keynote speech , " but we might need to change just about everything else we do			1
there 's a problem with @entity1 's prescription , however , rooted in an idea that @entity20 once articulated -- " stupid is as stupid does			1
" as the @entity9 enters a period of reassessment , it knows it desperately needs to reach out beyond its older white male conservative populist base			1
@entity1 is an appealing symbol of that needed change -- a young @entity28 governor who is also an @entity31 @entity30 and former @entity29			1
the @entity9 's problem in reaching out beyond its conservative base is not simply a matter of communication and tone			1
the problem is in the party 's policies			1
but because @entity1 needs to keep the conservative base in his corner to mount a widely expected 2016 presidential campaign , he is restrained from really dealing with the root of the problem			1
some @entity9 - led states look at electoral vote changes instead , his well - written speech -- presented as a refutation of president @entity51 's second inaugural address -- was incomplete and dominated by many of the straw - man arguments he decried			2
defensively , @entity1 assured his audience that his federalist vision of modernizing the @entity9 did not mean " moderating " its policies in any way			1
" i am not one of those who believe we should moderate , equivocate or otherwise abandon our principles , " @entity1 said			2
" this badly disappoints many of the liberals in the national media , of course			0
for them , real change means : supporting abortion on demand without apology , abandoning traditional marriage between one man and one woman , embracing government growth as the key to @entity30 success , agreeing to higher taxes every year to pay for government expansion , and endorsing the enlightened policies of @entity81 socialism			0
" the tragicomic caricature does not describe what @entity83 believe or what a centrist @entity9 might want			2
but the markers @entity1 puts down means he is backing social conservative positions such as opposition to same - sex marriage and the call for a constitutional ban on abortion that is codified in the party platform			1
many voters -- especially members of the millennial generation -- consider these positions at odds with libertarians ' professed belief in maximizing individual freedom , but the contradiction and resulting voter alienation is entirely sidestepped			0
confronting it is politically inconvenient , if not impossible			0
not being the stupid party also means supporting science and the separation of church and state , at least to the extent that creationism is not taught in public schools			1
but @entity1 has backed the teaching of creationism in @entity2 public schools in a pander to conservative populists			1
when @entity1 says , " we must not become the party of austerity			1
we must become the party of growth , " he is arguing for a positive frame for the conservative message			2
but he is not actually questioning conservatives ' call to cut federal spending and social programs dramatically , which could restrict growth and alienate efforts to appeal beyond the base			2
he 's just saying the @entity9 should present the glass as half full			2
i 'm all for reinventing government and reducing bureaucracy dramatically -- as @entity1 calls for -- but part of " talking to @entity30 like adults " -- involves talking about the real costs and consequences , not just reframing the debate			2
@entity1 rightly says , " we had a number of @entity9 damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments			1
we 've had enough of that			0
" he 's presumably referring to the self - destructed tea - evangelist @entity147 campaigns of @entity148 and @entity149 -- which alienated women and centrist voters with the candidates ' tortured talk about rape , biology and abortion			0
but the problem with those bizarre and offensive comments was rooted in the policies the @entity147 candidates were being asked to defend -- namely , their faith - based opposition to abortion , even in cases of rape			2
unless , that policy is addressed , the problem will remain			0
silence on the subject does n't solving anything			0
analysis : @entity1 lays down 2016 marker likewise , correcting the overwhelmingly white complexion of the conservative base will require more than just talking to everyone as individuals and rejecting identity politics			1
it will require backing policies such as comprehensive immigration reform -- as @entity180 and @entity181 have backed			0
@entity1 stayed silent on the subject and substance			2
there is a lot to admire in @entity1 's speech -- first and foremost the courage it took to challenge his party in unvarnished terms so soon after a stinging election loss			1
he is right about the need to offer a compelling contrast rooted in radical simplification to decrease costs and increase efficiency			0
@entity1 is correct in saying that @entity198 's failure was in large part his inability to move beyond simply criticizing @entity51 and offer a detailed positive policy alternative			2
but that failure was rooted in the fact that much of current conservative policy is broadly unpopular , a problem only compounded when the party becomes more polarized and dominated by the far - right debating society			1
the demonization of @entity51 beyond all reason and reality only adds to the credibility gap that conservatives are now confronting			0
most leading national @entity83 -- whether it is @entity51 , @entity214 , @entity215 or @entity216 -- may be decidedly center - left , but they are basically pragmatic progressives , not the kind of fuming anti-american statists many conservatives imagine			0
most @entity222 @entity30 understand this , and hard - core conservatives look a bit dotty for insisting their overheated vision is rooted in reality			0
there 's one final contradiction between rhetoric and reality that 's worth confronting			0
@entity1 spent a lot of time in his speech slamming the " barren concrete " of @entity235 and the job of " managing government			0
" but if @entity1 runs for president -- as seems increasingly likely -- he 'll be running for the privilege of living in that barren concrete jungle and managing the federal government			0
that 's a basic part of the job description			0
let 's be honest : @entity1 does n't really hate the federal government ; he wants to run it			0
@entity1 is courageous to call on his party to stop being " the stupid party			1
" but that slogan and his speech is a diagnosis of the problem , not a prescription for fixing it			1
confronting the impulse to pander to social conservative populists is necessary to fix " the stupid party			1
" the problem is in the policy , not just political perception			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

@entity2 gov. @entity1 *advocates* that @entity9 reach out beyond base
@entity260 : @entity1 is not dealing with the root of the problem , which is @entity9 policies
saying @entity9 must stop being " the stupid party " is a diagnosis but not a prescription , @entity260 says
@entity260 : confronting the impulse to pander to social conservative populists is necessary
