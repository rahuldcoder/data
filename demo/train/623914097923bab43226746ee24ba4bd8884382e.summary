@entity0 -- @entity2 personnel are taking precautionary measures after instruments aboard an aircraft carrier docked in @entity7 detected low levels of radioactivity from the @entity11 nuclear plant , the @entity2 said tuesday			1
the @entity13 @entity12 was docked for maintenance in @entity15 , about 175 miles ( 280 kilometers ) from the plant in @entity17 , when instruments detected the radiation at 7 a.m. tuesday ( 6 p.m. et monday ) , the @entity2 said in a statement			1
personnel will limit outdoor activities and secure external ventilation systems there and at a nearby air facility in @entity25			1
" there is no appreciable health risk , and we are being very conservative in our recommendations , " @entity7 commander rear adm. @entity26 said			2
in a recorded video message , @entity26 said the additional radiation exposure over the past 12 hours had been less than one month 's exposure to naturally occurring background radiation			0
workers are scrambling to cool down fuel rods and prevent a full meltdown in three reactors at the earthquake - hit @entity11 plant			1
@entity42 prime minister @entity41 warned tuesday that the risk of further releases of radioactive material from the plant remains " very high			0
" radioactive steam has been released intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the reactors			0
but radiation levels at the plant increased tuesday to " levels that can impact human health , " chief cabinet secretary @entity50 told reporters			0
the announcement came after an explosion at the plant 's no. 2 reactor			0
in addition , @entity50 said , the building housing the no. 4 unit -- which had been shut down before friday 's earthquake -- was burning tuesday morning , on monday the @entity2 said it was repositioning ships after tests had detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 @entity2 helicopter crew members that had been conducting disaster relief missions in @entity7			1
no further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water , the @entity2 said			2
the @entity2 's monday statement , however , provided some perspective , noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by ship personnel when it passed through the area was " less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks , soil , and the sun. " @entity1 's @entity86 and @entity87 contributed to this report .			0
