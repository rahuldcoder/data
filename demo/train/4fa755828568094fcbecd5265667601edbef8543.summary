@entity0 -- two men who have become @entity4 's first same - sex married couple have opened their hearts about the special qualities in each other that made them want to spend the rest of their lives together			1
in the nervous minutes leading up to wednesday 's groundbreaking ceremony in the southern city of @entity0 , @entity10 said he adored @entity19 's " charisma , his ability to appease me , calm me down ... also his sensibility and his determination			1
" and returning the warmth , @entity19 told @entity1 in the couple 's only interview on their wedding day : " what i love about him is his objectivity and the way he protects me			1
he is my great protector			0
" but their marriage is not just about their love ; they also want to build a family and , perhaps , teach future generations how to break down prejudices			1
" we want children , we want to pass down values that are important to us , that we hold dear , that are right			0
and we want grandchildren and great - grandchildren , a real family , " @entity19 said			1
" one of the reasons we want children is because children have no judgement , and we want to break down society 's barriers			0
" he added that " when @entity4 children are born into this world , they are born with the same rights as everyone else -- but from the moment you said you were a homosexual , society deprived you of some of those rights			2
today the @entity4 has given these rights back to us			2
" the 40 - year - old , who works for @entity0 's tourism office , expressed his gratitude to those who had helped win the controversial right for same - sex couples to marry , legislation that was signed into law 10 days ago by president @entity67			1
" we are very nervous , but obviously excited			0
this is a step forward for @entity4			2
what 's happened today is thanks to everybody who has been so mobilized over the past few months			0
" the change in the law has not been without its opponents , prompting sometimes - violent demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people across @entity4			1
" it 's very sad that they turned violent , " @entity19 said			1
" it 's always so surprising to feel so attacked , but you must remember this was a minority and most people are in favor			0
this proves that love can triumph over hatred			0
" " so thankful to those who helped us come to this moment			0
some of the people we 're referring to have passed away , such as @entity92 [ the first openly gay @entity93 elected to public office ] who was a great inspiration			0
" @entity19 described how the couple met seven years ago			1
while surfing the net at the same time , they both chanced on an online fan forum for a pop star who found fame on a show similar to " @entity103			0
" a group of people decided to go for lunch , after which he and @entity10 , a 30 - year - old civil servant , became inseparable			2
like many a couple tying the knot , @entity19 declined to give details about what outfits they would wear , but he did confide what both parties hoped to get out of the big day : " obviously love , but also a great party			2
