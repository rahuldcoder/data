@entity0 -- " unauthorized and unprofessional " is how an internal memo describes the conduct of an air traffic controller , who allegedly allowed his two young children to speak with pilots on an air traffic control frequency , and his supervisor , who allegedly allowed it to happen			1
the memo , dated february 25 , was written after the facilities manager for the air traffic control tower at @entity0 's @entity14 learned about the incident , a source who has seen the memo told @entity1			1
" the display of professionalism in the past by the control personnel at this facility has been exemplary , " the memo said			1
" however , a lapse in judgment for what may seem a minor transgression diminishes our credibility and slights the high standards of professionalism			1
" it was not immediately clear what prompted the manager to write the memo or how he found out about the incident , the source said			2
the incidents occurred on succeeding days last month at @entity14 , the @entity38 said this week , and the controller and the supervisor have been placed on paid administrative leave			1
" we have an incredible team of professionals who safely control our nation 's skies every single day			1
this kind of behavior does not reflect the true caliber of our workforce , " @entity38 administrator @entity47 said in the statement wednesday			1
@entity47 was referring to the february 16 incident involving the controller 's young son , who is heard in a recording -- posted on liveatc.net -- clearing a @entity59 flight for takeoff and later speaking to an apparent @entity62 flight			2
later , an @entity38 official , who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing investigation , said the controller brought his daughter into the same tower the following day , and the child was allowed to talk with pilots of two planes			1
a separate source said the supervisor " should be making sure that things like this do n't happen			0
" yet another source familiar with the investigation said the two children are twins			0
the controller who brought the children to work later reported that he had done so , the source said			0
the controller and supervisor involved are veteran employees , the official said			0
@entity87 owner of the web site where the recording of the air traffic communications is posted , told @entity1 he thinks the attention the incident has drawn is " ridiculous " and it has been " blown out of proportion			1
" in the recording , a child says , " @entity59 171 , cleared for takeoff			0
" a man then tells the plane , " here 's what you get , guys , when the kids are out of school			2
" the pilot chuckles and says , " wish i could bring my kid to work			0
" the same pilot later tells the child , " awesome job			0
" during the recording , which is dated february 17 , the child also speaks to an apparent @entity62 flight			0
a recording from the following day , when the daughter was reportedly in the tower , also was posted on the web site			0
@entity38 spokeswoman @entity117 later said the incident took place about 7:30 p.m. february 16			2
@entity87 said most people " in the aviation community felt like this was ( not ) anything more than a noble thing , that a father would take his kid to work			0
" " it was one incident where a kid was up in the control tower , " he said			2
" if you know anything about aviation , you know that the air traffic control towers are highly supervised			1
... a father was taking a child to work and let the kid clear planes for takeoff and now the world thinks it 's an unsafe place			2
" the @entity38 has suspended all unofficial visits to air traffic control operational areas during its investigation into the incident			1
@entity47 has directed a team to review air traffic control policies and procedures related to facility visitors			1
the @entity148 , the union representing controllers , issued a statement , saying its members " do not condone this type of behavior in any way			0
" @entity1 's @entity155 contributed to this report .			0

memo says conduct of control personnel in the past " has been exemplary "
memo goes on to say the " lapse in judgment " slights the agency 's credibility
the @entity38 has suspended all unofficial visits to air traffic control operation areas
