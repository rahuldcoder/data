-- if there was any actor who could make the entire family laugh , it was @entity5			1
his humor played perfectly to audiences of all ages , and for many of his younger admirers , @entity5 will be remembered as the funniest adult they knew growing up			1
it was nearly impossible to come of age in the ' 90s and not experience the magic of @entity5 ' talent in movies like " @entity18 , " " @entity19 " and " mrs. @entity20			1
" for those who have forgotten , take a trip down memory lane and revisit these roles on which @entity5 left his mark : @entity26 in ' @entity27 ' ( 1997 ) what better way to start than with the film that won @entity5 his first and only @entity30 ? while " @entity27 " is widely known as the film that started the careers of @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity5 makes a powerful impression as counselor @entity26			1
instead of the outrageously loud funnyman , here he showcases more a more subdued side of his acting chops			0
as @entity26 , @entity5 perfectly encapsulated the type of man we look up to , a man who could change the way we think about life			1
even when @entity5 was n't making us laugh , he still made us smile			1
" you can do anything you want , you are bound by nothing , " his character says in the movie			0
a beautiful quote from a fantastic performance			0
@entity53 in ' @entity53 ' ( 1996 ) with a plot this outrageous it would take a miracle actor to pull it off			0
luckily for director @entity57 ( yes you heard that right ) , he had the perfect man for the role of the main character , @entity53			0
the movie tells the story of a boy with a unique aging disorder that has aged him four times faster than normal			0
he enters school in the fifth grade with the appearance of a 40 - year - old man , and hilarity ensues			0
could there be a better fit for @entity5 ' flawless combo of adult and youthful humor ? @entity5 had an uncanny ability to make an audience laugh one minute and cry the next			1
while @entity53 's juvenile adventures through elementary school bring on the heavy laughs , he also breaks our hearts with his unrequited love for teacher @entity86 ( @entity87 ) and his tender relationship with his mother ( @entity89 )			0
the film is pretty reflective of @entity5 ' career in general -- even though he resembled a 40 - year - old man , child audiences grew up with him			1
@entity94 in ' @entity94 ' ( 1991 ) in this twist on the @entity97 classic , @entity5 plays an adult @entity99 who must return to @entity101 to rescue his children , who were kidnapped by @entity18			1
the only thing more fun than watching @entity5 grow up in the body of an adult , as with " @entity53 , " is watching him reclaim his youthfulness			1
as @entity5 ' @entity99 ventures to rescue his children , he inadvertently revisits his own childhood			1
of course , he had a little help from @entity110 ( @entity111 ) and @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , proving once again that @entity5 could be the star without stealing another actor 's spotlight			1
and kudos to " @entity18 " for having the best food - fight scene of all time			0
bang - a - rang @entity99 ! @entity119 in ' @entity119 ' ( 1989 ) one of @entity5 ' most iconic roles , in " @entity119 " @entity5 plays an @entity122 teacher who inspires his elite prep school students through the teaching of poetry			1
at first glance , it might not sound like your typical @entity5 film , but , as always , he managed to throw in his own unique touch to the role			1
his vocal transformations in this part are dynamite : who better to portray the voices in great poetry and literature ? @entity5 was legendary for being able to play dozens of characters in one sitting , jumping from one to the next without missing a beat			1
with fans ranging from the older generations down to rebellious youths , never has the motto carpe diem resonated with so many			1
there 's probably a person , right at this very moment , standing on top of a desk somewhere chanting " @entity150 , my captain " in @entity5 ' honor			1
@entity152 in ' @entity19 ' ( 1995 ) @entity5 really had his work cut out for him with " @entity19 , " as he had to portray a boy who 'd just been released back to the real world after 26 years stuck inside a jungle - themed board game			1
upon his release , @entity5 ' @entity152 is once again forced to play @entity19 alongside his former crush @entity159 ( @entity160 ) and kid siblings @entity99 and @entity164 ( a mini @entity162 ! )			2
as the game continues and the creatures of the jungle create mass destruction across the city , @entity5 takes the audience for a ride on the crazy train			2
while this could qualify as more of an action - adventure film as opposed to a comedy , there are always laughs when @entity5 is involved			2
the film was so popular it even spawned a real - life board game that no ' 90s kid could live without			0
just be careful when you play : " in the jungle you must wait , ' til the dice read five or eight			0
" genie in ' @entity184 ' ( 1992 ) we all know the tale : a street urchin falls in love with a princess and attempts to woo her into marrying him			0
oh , and there 's a blue , wise - cracking , singing genie that grants the poor man three wishes to win the princess ' heart			0
sure , @entity5 does n't have the title role in this animated classic , but he is without a doubt the most memorable part			2
in a film featuring a magic flying carpet , a nefarious screeching parrot and a smart - witted monkey sidekick , standing out can be a hard task			0
but not for @entity5 ' scene - stealing @entity183			2
@entity184 and @entity207 may have sung " @entity211 , " but it was @entity5 ' vocal abilities that had an opportunity to really shine here			2
once his character is introduced , a large portion of " @entity184 " basically becomes a stand - up act for @entity5 , real improvisations included			2
@entity20 and mrs. @entity20 in ' mrs. @entity20 ' ( 1993 ) this film 's plot could almost be a horror movie			0
after an ugly divorce , a man disguises himself as a female housekeeper named mrs. @entity20 in an attempt to sneak back into his home and spend more time with his children			0
but thanks to @entity5 ' irresistible energy , this is a hilarious family - charmer			2
brilliantly , @entity5 is able to make mrs. @entity20 her own individual character without ever letting the audience forget he is the one in the costume			2
while every other character is completely in the dark of her true identity , he gives the ultimate wink to viewers			0
the fact that " @entity20 " is so often cited as a @entity5 favorite is a no - brainer given @entity5 ' acting and comedic range			2
the film revolves around his impersonations , and he flawlessly flies through dozens throughout the film			0
whether he was interviewing with a social worker for a job , receiving a makeover transformation from his lovable brother , or playing @entity20 , this role helped @entity5 become an icon to every child of the ' 90s			1
thank you @entity5 , not only for making us laugh , but for growing up with us			0
complete coverage on @entity5 videos : the world according to @entity5 @entity5 leaves behind four films to be released			0

@entity5 ' career impacted generations
fans who came of age in the ' 90s were treated to some of his best work
for many , he was the funniest adult around
thanks to his playful humor , @entity5 grew up along with his young fans
