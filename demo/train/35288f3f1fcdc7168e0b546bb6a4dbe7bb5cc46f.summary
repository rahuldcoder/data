-- each spring brings major medical meetings from the likes of the @entity3 , the @entity4 and the @entity5 , to name a few			1
these meetings began as forums for scientists to meet and discuss findings and generate ideas			1
they offer opportunities for physicians to learn about new studies and possible new treatments , and for those interested in medicine , the meetings are fascinating and enjoyable			2
but over the past several decades , these gatherings have more and more become venues for drug companies and medical device manufacturers to tell physicians about their drugs and medical hardware			1
today , much of the presented research is sponsored by industry , and these medical meetings are increasingly an opportunity for companies to make a name for themselves by promoting their products			1
doctors find themselves asking when promotion of a product or a company stops being education and becomes a naked attempt at advertising			2
companies have found that the investors watch these meetings like a hawk , looking for the earliest bit of data that may show promising results for a new drug			1
successful promotion of positive findings through meeting abstracts and press releases can double or triple a small company 's share price			2
but observers note a troubling trend			0
it is a shame that the desire to pump up a stock price often leads to over-promotion and exaggeration of paltry scientific findings			0
recently , the economic crisis in the media has led to the disappearance , through layoffs or by choice , of some wonderful , skilled and seasoned science writers			1
and with that comes genuine concern			0
the veterans have been replaced by mostly young , inexperienced writers who suddenly find themselves under pressure to turn out compelling stories about difficult scientific medical studies that are all too easy to oversimplify and misinterpret			1
meanwhile , to bolster readership or numbers of viewers , the media reward reporters whose stories can lead to the most eye - grabbing headline			1
these reporters are well - meaning , but if they do not understand medicine and the scientific process , these articles can truly harm public health			1
and , in my experience , that is happening more and more often			0
and even more important : reporters must understand that the motivation of every scientific report must be questioned as part of routine due diligence			2
the caveats from each report must also be clearly detailed in each story			0
from where i sit , all too often , that is not happening			0
this combination of scientists and businessmen enthusiastically promoting products or themselves with sales pitches , and inexperienced reporters struggling to make sense of their claims , has led to some unfortunate articles			1
i was motivated to write this after reading articles in reputable newspapers in the @entity112 and @entity113 that a cure for breast cancer was on the horizon and a blood test was coming to market that could detect lung cancer early and save lives			0
truth be told , a lab cured breast cancer in six mice			0
but translating these findings to humans is difficult , and experience has taught us that it likely will never happen			0
some of these articles also failed to say that this is a very early piece of scientific progress at best -- and may not even be progress			0
as for the blood tests , i have read reports of some that are somewhat effective in finding lung cancer			0
but the articles failed to point out that any test will require years of more development to determine whether it 's useful			0
they also failed to report that the study showed that the test was no more accurate than @entity143 , which are not recommended by any major medical organization			2
unfortunately , by the time measured voices put these stories into perspective , the media have moved on to a new story			2
the end result of all this is very harmful			0
the nonscientific public gets misled , and some of those folks who have an interest in a specific disease get their hopes up , only to be disappointed			2
i was taught by a wise physician that the worst thing we in medicine can do is deceive our patients			0
another event that motivated me to write this opinion piece : one of the good , smart medical writers who toil in this field every day , unheralded and woefully underpaid , asked me a really good question			1
i realized that these good hard questions are less frequent as the good medical and scientific writers , most of whom i 've had the privilege of enjoyed working with over the years , are becoming an endangered species			1
this decline of the professional medical and science writer is a threat to the public health as important as the latest scare story in the headlines -- perhaps even more so			1
unfortunately , this is one health threat that has received little attention			2
maybe it 's time to change that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : each spring , medical associations meet to discuss research , ideas
@entity185 says drug and medical companies increasingly come to promote products
he says seasoned medical writers have been replaced by *gullible* , inexperienced reporters
their stories often *overpromote* claims , he writes , exaggerate *benefits* , harm public health
