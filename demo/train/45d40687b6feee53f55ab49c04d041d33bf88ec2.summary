when exactly did once - lowly kale become an international locavore staple ? not sure , but let 's call it 2011 , when @entity4 made kale chips on tv with @entity7			2
what 's that got to do with a list of great veg eateries around the world ? we 're not sure -- we just know that , like the rest of the world , we 've been spending more time lately eating plants we 'd never heard of when we were kids and seeking out an evolving supply of incredible vegetarian options while traveling			2
from the world 's only city with an all - vegan strip mall to those with large @entity25 and @entity26 populations and a huge variety of options , the following vegetarian - friendly destinations have imaginative restaurants with cult - like followings			1
some of the cities on this list are obvious choices , while others , like @entity35 , @entity36 , have only recently forayed in any significant way into vegetarian cuisine			1
here are our top 10 choices for herbivores who travel			0
@entity42 , @entity43 from vegetarian / vegan - friendly bed - and - breakfasts to the world 's only all - vegan strip mall , compassionate choices rule many establishments in this city			1
we recommend : @entity50 , the brainchild of @entity53 graduate @entity52			0
with @entity56 - style decor and fare derived from @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , this excellent restaurant serves dishes such as chard and mushroom gnocchi and caramelized cauliflower with polenta , using local vegetables and fruits at their seasonal peak			1
@entity50 , 3033 n.e. alberta st. , @entity42 , @entity43 ; +1 503 288 5883 @entity70 the chance of blindly stumbling into a vegetarian restaurant is probably higher in @entity70 than in any other @entity74 city			1
while there 's seemingly no end of diversity , from raw restaurants like @entity79 to farm - to - table @entity80 , our latest favorite is the amazingly creative @entity83			1
