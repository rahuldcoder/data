-- the decision on whether @entity2 pays for sex - change operations is now in the hands of regional administrators , thanks to a decision friday by a federal board that overturned a national policy of not covering such surgeries			1
the ruling by the @entity12 of the @entity13 gives authority to 15 regional contractors who administer the @entity2 program to decide whether sex - change surgeries will be covered in their territories			1
" the national policy barring @entity2 from covering gender transition surgery has been invalidated , " said @entity2 spokesman @entity20 in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" as with all such determinations , @entity2 will carry out this independent board 's ruling through @entity27 , who manage @entity2 claims payment systems			1
these contractors may cover this care case - by - case or under a local coverage determination based on clinical evidence to determine medical appropriateness , " added @entity32 , whose agency administers @entity2 and @entity34			2
the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , and the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) responded with a joint statement praising the move : " this decision removes a threshold barrier to coverage for medical care for transgender people under @entity2			0
it is consistent with the consensus of the medical and scientific community that access to gender transition - related care is medically necessary for many people with gender dysphoria , " the statement said			0
" the removal of the exclusion of coverage for surgical care for @entity2 recipients means that individuals will not automatically have claims of coverage for gender transition - related surgeries denied			2
they should either get coverage or , at a minimum , receive an individualized review of the medical need for the specific procedure they seek , just like anyone seeking coverage for any other medical treatment			0
" the @entity76 issued a statement that concluded , " the dominoes are falling rapidly			0

until friday , a national policy barred @entity2 from covering sex - change surgery
