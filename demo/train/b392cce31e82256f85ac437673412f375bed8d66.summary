-- imagine your doctor telling you there 's nothing she can do , that your life has shifted , and you are headed to a lifetime full of painful treatments , possibly radical surgery , and even early death			0
that there 's simply no prescription that can work			0
now imagine your doctor telling you that scientists have discovered a breakthrough , one that just might brighten the life you thought was headed into shadows , one that just might save your life			0
this narrative , or one like it , is unfolding right now for the 3 million @entity18 -- and 175 million people all over the world -- with hepatitis @entity22 the progress has been stunning , with new and forthcoming treatments now curing up to 90 % of patients			1
in a health care climate mired in relentless , negative back - and - forth , it 's encouraging to see what hard work can turn into for @entity18 's patients			1
it 's also an opportunity to learn from the recent past			0
in the 1980s and early 1990s , @entity33 was considered a death sentence			0
doctors then had the task of telling their patients that nothing could be done			0
that early death was , in most cases , inevitable			0
but for people all over the world with hiv / aids , the dawn of anti-retroviral medications in the mid- 1990s transformed @entity33 from near - certain death into a manageable chronic disease			2
in the @entity18 , the @entity33 - related death rate has fallen by more than 80 % since then , in large part because of advances in anti-retroviral therapy			2
over the past 30 years , nearly 40 medicines have been approved to treat @entity33 , and we now know that many of these medicines can also help prevent transmission of the disease as well			0
the parallels between hiv / aids and hepatitis c are remarkable -- and a reason for optimism			2
when @entity33 was still considered a death sentence , some also claimed that treatments for it would bankrupt the health care system , as critics are claiming about the hepatitis @entity68 that did not happen			1
one reason is that cost containment is built into the system through the medicine life cycle			0
in its initial phases , innovator biopharmaceutical companies produce medical advances through pioneering scientific work and massive investments , like the $ 500 billion invested in research and development since 2000			0
after that , competition enters the market and lower - cost generics become available , helping achieve long - term savings			1
2013 : @entity87 approves breakthrough drug for treatment of hepatitis c as a result of market dynamics and generic drug usage , the cost of medicines overall has grown more slowly in recent years than other health care costs , and makes up just 10 % to 12 % of total health care @entity97 same can happen with treatments for hepatitis c , whose value becomes even more apparent when considering the cost consequences of not acting			1
although critics say the price of a promising new hepatitis c drug raises the cost of insurance , research from @entity108 in 2009 projected that , without a cure for hepatitis c , annual @entity18 medical costs associated with the disease will nearly triple over 20 years -- from $ 30 billion to $ 85 billion -- indicating that curing the disease can help reduce future medical costs			1
opinion : we all pay for $ 1,000 a pill drug and recent projections show that the cost of curing hepatitis c patients will be far less than some have claimed			2
@entity121 estimates that new medicines for hepatitis c will increase health care costs by just half a percent in 2014 and will level off after 2016 as patients are cured			1
this is particularly noteworthy given that public discussions have focused almost exclusively on the price of new medicines while ignoring the tremendous societal benefits , including the potential to prevent even more expensive health care interventions such as liver transplant surgeries and related hospitalizations			1
the finest biopharmaceutical research in the world helped wrestle hiv / aids down into a manageable disease			2
now , it is giving us the same opportunity against hepatitis c -- and many more diseases.e need to move forward , and let the harrowing experience of hiv / aids patients inform our continued war against diseases like hepatitis c. and simple economics will remind us that , while investments at first may seem challenging , the prescription drug life cycle , market forces and tenacious global competition can lead to lower prices and broad access over time			1
behalf of @entity18 's hepatitis c patients , let 's repeat that success once more .			1

@entity161 : new drugs give hope to 3 million @entity18 with hepatitis c
he says breakthrough similar to what retroviral drugs did for hiv / aids patients
@entity161 : critics say drugs ' high price will raise health care costs , but that 's short - term
he says drug will make costly health care interventions , like liver transplants , *unnecessary*
