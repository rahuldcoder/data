-- @entity3 insurgents who staged a daring , well - planned raid on @entity5 , the military base where @entity7 's prince @entity6 is deployed , were wearing @entity9 uniforms , @entity1 said a day after the attack			1
it 's extremely rare for @entity3 insurgents to use @entity13 uniforms in their attacks			1
the last time @entity0 can identify was more than two years ago , when @entity1 repelled attacks on two bases in @entity17 in august 2010			2
no coalition troops were killed in that attack , @entity1 's @entity18 said at the time			1
at least two @entity13 @entity21 were killed in the brazen strike late on friday , and six jets were destroyed , @entity18 said as it released more details about the raid			1
well - trained , well - rehearsed fighters carried out the sustained assault in @entity29 province , @entity18 said			2
about 15 insurgents organized into three teams penetrated the base 's perimeter fence and did considerable damage , destroying six refueling stations and damaging six aircraft hangars			0
the attackers toted automatic rifles , rocket - propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests			2
they destroyed six @entity43 jets and damaged two others before the attack ended , the coalition said			0
fourteen of the fighters were killed and one was wounded and captured , @entity18 said			0
eight coalition military personnel and one civilian contractor were also wounded			0
it is too soon to say whether the attackers had " inside knowledge , " @entity18 spokesman @entity50 said			0
@entity18 would not say how the attackers got the uniforms , but @entity0 staff who have spent time in @entity3 say they are for sale in markets there			1
there has been at least one other case of @entity3 insurgents wearing @entity13 uniforms , in may 2010			1
and in @entity65 five years ago , there was a dramatic and successful raid using the tactic			0
attackers wearing what appeared to be @entity13 uniforms were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of five @entity13 soldiers in @entity74 , @entity65 , in 2007			1
prince @entity6 is an @entity75 helicopter pilot based at @entity5 , but the @entity7 @entity76 categorically rejected reports in sunday 's @entity7 press that he was just a few hundred yards away from the gun battle			1
@entity6 , a grandson of @entity84 and third in line to the @entity7 throne , " was in no way in any danger " during the latest attack , @entity18 spokesman maj. @entity80 said earlier			2

@entity94 , the @entity13 side of the base , was not affected by the attack , maj. @entity93 , an @entity18 spokesman , told @entity0			2
the joint base is located in a remote desert region of @entity29 , the southern province in the @entity101 heartland			0
the @entity101 said it carried out the strike , calling it a response to the anti-islam film stoking anger among @entity105			0
yet @entity80 said there had no organized demonstrations outside its gates before the assault			0
@entity3 has seen only relatively small and peaceful demonstrations against the film during a week in which there were protests across predominantly muslim - countries and other locations			2
separately , four @entity13 troops were killed by @entity3 police on sunday , an administration official said after @entity1 's @entity18 reported the attack			1
the latest attack on coalition troops by their supposed @entity3 allies brings the number of people killed in so - called " green on blue " incidents to more than 50 this year			1
the killing of the four @entity13 on sunday is the latest in a series of incidents in which members of @entity3 security forces have been suspected of turning their weapons on coalition or @entity3 soldiers , known as green - on - blue attacks			1
@entity137 says @entity139 , @entity138 committed to preventing @entity3 riots sunday 's killings came only a day after the @entity7 @entity76 announced that two troops had been killed in @entity29 's @entity144 district			2
