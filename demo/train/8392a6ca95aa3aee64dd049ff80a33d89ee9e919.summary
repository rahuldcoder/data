@entity9 's government and the @entity11 , or @entity11 , have signed a framework for the talks , @entity9 president @entity8 said in a televised address tuesday			1
the framework is a " road map " that aims to resolve a conflict that has seen previous negotiations backfire on the government			0
the outcome of these talks will " fall on my shoulders , and no one else , " @entity8 said			0
the @entity9 government confirmed last month that " exploratory " talks had taken place between the rebels and the government			2

the next stage will be formal peace talks , which will begin in @entity6 and then move to @entity30 , @entity31			1
in a video statement recorded in @entity9 's mountains and broadcast to reporters in @entity30 , the leftist guerrilla group 's leader thanked the governments of @entity38 , @entity31 and @entity7 for facilitating the agreement to begin peace talks			1
" another @entity9 is possible , and between all of us , we can create it , " said @entity11 leader @entity40 , who is also known as @entity41 or @entity42			1
the talks , he said , " are above all the triumph of the national clamor for peace and a political solution			2
" the @entity11 's six - person negotiation team did not take questions tuesday , but said they would speak to reporters again on thursday			1

the true and only custodians of such a key are the people of this country , " @entity59 said			0
critics , including former @entity9 president @entity65 , say it is impossible to hold peace talks without a unilateral ceasefire by the guerrillas			1

peace is possible because of @entity9 's economic growth and engagement with the world , the president said			1

we fight to achieve peace , " he declared			0
the president said it will not be an open - ended peace process , and progress will be reviewed monthly			0
the @entity11 has complied with everything it has promised so far , @entity8 said , and if the group continues to negotiate with the same seriousness , the outlook for the talks is good			2

@entity130 officials praised news of the talks			0
