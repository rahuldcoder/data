-- @entity3 maxi @entity1 took advantage of a break in light weather conditions to steal a march on its rivals in the annual @entity11 - @entity10 yacht race off the south - east coast of @entity13 on sunday			1
skipper @entity1 's 100 - foot vessel has led since leaving @entity15 , and moved more than 10 nautical miles ahead at the halfway stage in the evening			1
second - placed @entity21 entry @entity19 and @entity13 's four - time line honors winner @entity17 failed to catch an early breeze , giving @entity1 the edge with more patchy weather predicted ahead in the 628 nautical mile event			1
leopard skipper @entity26 told the race 's official web site that @entity1 made a break at around 9 a.m. near @entity30 after hours of frustratingly light winds			1
" we were all just splashing about , there was no breeze whatsoever , and it 's always the case that someone will get that little extra puff , " @entity26 said			0
" @entity1 was in the right place to get it			2
we did n't get it , @entity17 did n't get it , and @entity1 put 10 miles on us both very quickly			2
" @entity17 set the race record of one day , 18 hours and 40 minutes in 2005 , but that mark is almost certain to still be standing at the end of the 65th staging of the event , with the winner expected to cross the line on arrival at the island state of @entity49 on monday night			1
" we were unfortunate to get into a hole			0
we could see @entity1 when she got her nose into the new breeze , " skipper @entity51 told rolexsydneyhobart.com			2
there is always an element of luck , and things went his way			0
it 's one of those frustrating things -- a role reversal of 2005			0
" however , with conditions uncertain there is still a chance that 2002 winner @entity1 could yet be denied a first victory in a yacht that was launched in 2005 and has 143 line honors triumphs to date			1
" the big guys will have some running in @entity74 , but there are still a lot of potholes between that and the finish , " yachting forecaster @entity71 told the web site			0
" anyone of the three could finish first			0
" @entity84 's @entity11 47 @entity83 is a surprise leader in the handicap standings , while the @entity87 became the fifth entry to retire and leave the fleet reduced to 95			2
the race , first held in 1945 , has been hit by severe weather conditions in recent years			1
