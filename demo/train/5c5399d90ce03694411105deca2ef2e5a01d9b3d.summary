@entity0 -- a divided @entity2 ruled wednesday against a @entity4 pilot who sued after the federal government publicly revealed his @entity7 status			1
in a 5 - 3 ruling , the high court decided @entity11 's claims of mental and emotional distress are not covered under the @entity13			1
" the @entity13 does not unequivocally authorize damages for mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the government 's sovereign immunity for such harms , " justice @entity14 wrote for the conservative majority			1
three liberal justices dissented , while a fourth , former solicitor general @entity21 , did not participate			1
in a statement wednesday , @entity11 said it was " discouraging that a majority of the court sided with the government			1
" @entity11 became a licensed recreational pilot in 1964 , but two decades later , the @entity29 man was diagnosed with @entity7			1
as his condition worsened , he let his private pilot 's certificate and his airman medical certificate lapse			2
in 1996 , @entity11 applied for long - term disability with the @entity35			2
" i was in bad shape , i did n't have long to live , " he said last year			0
but his health improved thanks to a cocktail of anti-retroviral therapy			0
he went back to work and wanted to fly again			0
" i found out they were issuing medicals ( exemptions ) and i reapplied " to the @entity45 " without revealing my @entity7 status , " he said			1
" he received his new pilot 's certificate but , unknown to him , a joint local - federal initiative called @entity51 was launched in 2002			1
using a spreadsheet , the agencies shared and compared the names and personal data of about 45,000 pilots in @entity4 , looking for potentially medically unfit individuals who were also receiving federal benefits			1
@entity11 was among four dozen or so pilots tagged as a " person of interest			0
" when confronted by government agents , he admitted to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false report			2
he was sentenced to probation and fined , and his pilot 's certificate was revoked			2
the retired business executive 's name was listed in a federal press release and later , through his prosecution , @entity11 's medical history suddenly was a matter of public record			2
" i had been able to control those ( with ) whom i shared my information about my @entity7 status , limited to some co-workers , family , and close friends , " he said " and suddenly that was out of my control			1
" @entity11 , who was eventually allowed to fly again , sued			2
" i chose not to reveal my @entity7 infection and that was a very bad thing , " he said			1
" i took responsibility for it and i paid the price			0
and i think now it 's the government 's turn to own up to breaking the law and take responsibility for what they did			1
" a federal judge found both the @entity45 and the @entity35 violated the @entity13 with the information - sharing investigation , but said under the law , only " actual damages " could be collected by plaintiffs seeking redress			1
since @entity11 made no claims for economic harm , such as lost wages or medical expenses , he was out of luck			0
the judge found " emotional injury " alone did not qualify and dismissed the lawsuit			0
a federal appeals court reversed that decision , ruling for @entity11			2
the @entity45 then asked the high court to intervene			2
during an hour of oral arguments last year , the justices stayed away from the specific claims of emotional harm made by @entity11 , focusing instead on what the law says about qualifying for damages			2
" the argument you have made -- and i certainly understand it , that this is the @entity13 and so it 's precisely these types of damages that you would be concerned about -- really cuts both ways , " chief justice @entity118 said to @entity11 's lawyer			1
" what you are saying is this ( law ) covers a really big chunk of damages , because this is what the whole act was about , " @entity118 said			2
" and it seems to me that argument suggests that there is some weight to the government 's point : that if you are going to get that , you really do need clearer " language in the law that would immunize the government to some extent , from a flood of hard - to - disprove lawsuits			1
the ambiguity has divided lower courts for years , and privacy experts said the ease with which the government can collect and share information in the digital age makes the issue of personal privacy liability ripe for review			0
justice @entity155 repeatedly hammered away at the government lawyer arguing for the @entity45			2
she said the federal damages provision in question is similar to state tort claims that include both emotional and financial harm			0
" the person who is subject to this , to this embarrassment , this humiliation , does n't have out - of - pocket costs , but is terribly distressed , nervous , anxious , and all the rest , " @entity155 said			0
" the act that the @entity169 is reaching , the impact is of that nature			0
i mean , pecuniary ( monetary ) damages ordinarily attend conduct that embarrasses , humiliates you , causes mental distress			0
" @entity175 of the @entity176 said the @entity13 's language may be interpreted as allowing damages for such things as " humiliation , embarrassment and mental anguish , " but said because the phrase " actual " damages remains vague , the government should get the benefit of the doubt , tipping the case in its favor			1
" simply because a plaintiff may have suffered an adverse effect " from the privacy violation , argued @entity175 , " does n't mean that the plaintiff suffered actual damages			1
" @entity195 , @entity11 's lawyer , pointed out during the hearing that his client 's information was made public and his name and hiv status are still posted on a federal government database			1
he also made a larger argument , that his client 's dilemma is one that may affect all @entity206			0
" @entity169 passed this act to restore the citizens ' faith in their government , and it made a solemn promise to the @entity206 citizens that in cases of intentional and willful violation , the @entity206 shall be liable for actual damages , " @entity195 said			1
" today , the government is proposing that " actual damages " be read in a way that renders this act virtually irrelevant			1
that makes a mockery of that solemn promise			0
" @entity11 attended the public session at the court and expressed optimism afterward he would prevail			0
" they 've betrayed my trust and i ca n't get that back , " @entity11 said at the time			0
" there was nothing to lose here			0
i had to do it			0
it was the right thing to do			0
" the case is @entity11 v. @entity45 ( 10 - 1024 )			0
@entity1 's @entity234 and @entity235 contribute to this report .			0
