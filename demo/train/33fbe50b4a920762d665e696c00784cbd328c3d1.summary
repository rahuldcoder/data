-- five years ago this month , @entity1 hit @entity2			1
what it created is a tale of two cities , the haves vs. the have - nots			1
enormous progress in the city 's @entity10 overshadows the lingering blight in the 9th @entity13 and @entity14 , where folks are still struggling to rebuild and many lots remain empty			1
unfortunately , @entity1 attacked the two poorest states in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
it destroyed or disrupted the economic engines of both states : their tourism , shipbuilding , fisheries , port operations industries and petroleum production in the @entity30			2
@entity1 left about 1,836 people dead , destroyed about 275,000 homes in @entity19 , @entity33 and @entity20 , and cost the federal government about $ 114 billion			1
but there is good news			2
post-katrina tax incentives have had a dramatic impact			1
the region has more hotels and restaurants than it had before the hurricane , and its major infrastructure -- sewer , water , public service buildings , police and fire departments , @entity49 -- has new or rebuilt buildings			1
federal money has transformed the schools in @entity2 , reorganizing them into charter schools , which are a far cry from @entity56 's dysfunctional schools operating in dilapidated buildings			1
public health in @entity2 before @entity1 meant treatment in run - down , understaffed public hospitals			1
chief of those was @entity64 , known as " @entity65 , " the state - run teaching hospital for @entity68			0
but it is no more			0
the @entity70 , next to @entity65 , was also destroyed during @entity1			0
afterward , much discussion revolved around whether to repair or replace @entity65			0
the @entity72 insisted on providing only repair money versus money to replace charity with a hospital that could share a campus with a new @entity70			0
it took four years to get a @entity72 decision on helping to pay for replacing charity , yet during this period of indecision , the city and state public health systems built community - based clinics			1
this is a 21st - century medical system far superior to pre-katrina hospital - based public health			2
@entity2 ' levee and water control systems have been steadily improved by upgrading pumps with backup generators			1
gates have been installed at critical canals to help block water from entering the city during storm surges			0
about 325 miles of levees are around the city and surrounding parish , and work on the levees continues			0
but seemingly intractable problems that affect the poorest residents still beset the city			0
two years ago , during @entity109 , water was splashing over the levee protecting the 9th @entity13 , the neighborhood most devastated by @entity1			0
@entity112 reminded us the city remains vulnerable to levee failure -- any levee is no match for nature			2
the enduring erosion of the coastline , caused by bad water management all the way from the upper @entity123 and the coastal canals , erodes the marshes and leaves coastal @entity20 exposed to the full brunt of future hurricanes			0
public safety and housing remain the most difficult issues			1
crime is a major problem in the @entity2 , and the police department is under enormous strain			1
several groups of @entity137 employees are under federal investigation , accused of abuse of power -- including murder charges			0
today , in these tough economic times , police officers are being asked to accept a 10 percent pay cut			0
most officers can not take their police cars home without paying for that privilege			0
public safety has a long way to go			2
also , more bad than good has been said of @entity20 's " @entity152 " program , designed to help displaced residents get back into their houses			0
the shining star of home rebuilding , instead , is the enormous amount of volunteers who work tirelessly to help poor folks get back into their homes			1
many middle - class neighborhoods still include blighted houses			2
the only option for the owners , who do n't have the cash to rebuild , is to tear them down			0
the 9th and 7th @entity164 and @entity14 have the worst problems			0
many people remain frustrated with the " @entity152 " program			0
although some got enough money to rebuild , most complain that the amount of provided by insurance and @entity72 falls far short of actual repair costs			0
@entity72 used pre-katrina values to determine repair costs , but the costs of building materials and labor were a lot higher after the hurricane			0
@entity2 also had one of the highest number of renters in the country , at about 37 percent of residents			1
initially , @entity72 did not provide funding to rebuild rented housing			2
the slow economy that followed @entity1 put limits on the amount of cash for building affordable housing			2
most of the city 's public housing projects were demolished			1
the city and private companies are building mixed - use public housing , but most of the poor people i speak with are suspicious of the effort			1
the @entity10 is in better shape than ever , but the legacy of @entity1 's destruction lives on in the poorer neighborhoods of the @entity204 and @entity14			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : post-katrina @entity2 is a tale of two cities , haves vs. have nots
progress in the @entity10 but lingering blight in poorer neighborhoods , he says
@entity207 points to new hotels , restaurants , public service buildings , charter schools
but crime remains high , many homes still a *wreck* , little public housing for poor , he says
