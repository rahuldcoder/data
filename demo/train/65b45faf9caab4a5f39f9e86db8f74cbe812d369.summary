-- goals rained down in the @entity2 on saturday , but for once @entity3 played it safe to stay seven points clear at the top of the table			1
@entity9 's team kept a clean sheet for the first time in six games , beating @entity13 2 - 0 at home in a match that had been in danger of succumbing to the @entity18 's recent wet weather			1
by contrast , second - placed @entity20 scrambled a 4 - 3 win at @entity23 , @entity19 came from behind to claim third with a 2 - 1 victory at @entity25 and @entity26 moved fifth after triumphing 7 - 3 at home to @entity28			1
all eight @entity2 matches provided goals -- 35 in all -- with @entity31 drawing 3 - 3 with @entity32 , @entity33 beating @entity34 3 - 0 , @entity35 winning 2 - 1 at @entity36 and @entity37 ending a long winless run by defeating @entity39 1 - 0			1
@entity3 edged a controversial seven - goal thriller against @entity28 on wednesday , showing the defensive frailties that have plagued the 19 - time @entity43 champions this season , but the return of @entity46 helped steady the side against a @entity13 team that has dropped to seventh place			1
the visitors went behind in the ninth minute when @entity51 deflected @entity53 's cross past his own keeper -- former @entity3 player @entity54 -- and substitute @entity55 wrapped it up at the end with a curling shot for his league - leading 14th goal this season			1
@entity9 was widely criticized for harassing match officials during the @entity28 match and for claiming that @entity62 " could have been killed " during the 1 - 1 draw with @entity35 , but he kept his comments low - key this time			1
" the pitch was a problem for us with the way we pass the ball -- it slowed our game down a bit , " said @entity9 , who turns 71 on monday			2
" we did well in the first half , we dominated at times , but you must give credit to @entity13 who had more of the game in the second half and were a threat with their crosses			2
" they had quite a bit of possession into the second period so we decided to bring @entity55 and @entity86 on just to settle us down a bit and they did that well			0
" it 's a good result considering how heavy the pitch was -- that 's two games in four days on it and it 's not easy			0
the slowness of it killed our speed			0
" blog : has @entity9 gone too far ? @entity13 boss @entity98 agreed with the officials ' decision to go ahead with the match after a late inspection of the waterlogged pitch			1
" we used to play on pitches like that all the time			0
you do n't look for games to be called off for no reason and there was no reason today , " he said			0
@entity20 boss @entity112 was not so happy after his defending champions bounced back from the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity25			1
recalled striker @entity115 scored twice inside four minutes , but @entity23 got back into the game after @entity117 was sent off just before halftime following an altercation with @entity120			2
" both players came forward with their heads , so if you are going to send off one , then you have to send off both , not only @entity117 , " @entity112 said			2
" i am disappointed with @entity117 , and he will pay his fine , but the decision was not correct			2
" the @entity127 will go into the @entity128 trying to retrieve a sizable deficit , though @entity20 overhauled @entity3 's eighth - point lead last season to win the club 's first title since 1968			1
" it 's not important to look at the table because it 's not final but we need only to work , to win and then maybe we 'll look again at the table in february , " he said			2
@entity115 almost had a hat - trick , but his 67th - minute shot hit the post and went into the net off @entity23 goalkeeper @entity143 for 4 - 2 , which was ruled to be an own goal			1
@entity145 netted his second on 75 , but @entity23 stayed 11th after a third successive defeat			0
@entity19 moved a point above @entity150 rivals @entity149 , who travel to sixth - placed @entity152 on sunday			0
@entity25 went ahead against the run of play as skipper @entity155 scored his first goal for the club five minutes before halftime , but @entity159 headed into his own net after the break and @entity163 's 51st - minute winner left @entity19 six points behind @entity20			1
however , @entity19 star @entity165 -- a reported target for @entity167 in the january transfer window -- was frustrated after being booked for diving for the third time this season			0
" that 's three times now i 've been clipped and booked for no reason , " said the @entity173 winger , who will miss tuesday 's clash with @entity37 following his fifth yellow card this season			0
" people keep saying i 'm diving , but if there 's contact it 's not diving			0
referees need to look more closely			0
" @entity183 bolstered his claims for a regular starting place as a central striker with his second - hat - trick this season in @entity26 's topsy - turvy win over 15th - placed @entity28 , which put the @entity150 side two points behind @entity149			1
the visitors leveled three times as @entity194 netted twice to take his league tally to 13 , but @entity183 's treble was complemented by a late double from substitute forward @entity198 after @entity199 and @entity200 also scored			0
@entity183 has yet to agree a new contract , and the @entity203 international will have no lack of interest from other clubs after taking his tally to 14 goals in all competitions this season -- only @entity62 has more with 17			0
@entity31 stayed eighth after coming from 3 - 1 down against third - bottom @entity32 , extending the club 's unbeaten home record to nine matches thanks to substitute striker @entity215 's spectacular late equalizer			1
defender @entity216 had reduced the deficit to 3 - 2 before teammate @entity218 was sent off for a challenge on @entity220			2
@entity35 moved up to ninth as @entity36 's stand - in keeper @entity222 gifted the visitors two goals -- the first to striker @entity227 , playing in place of the @entity231 club 's top scorer @entity229 , and the second to @entity233 midfielder @entity232			0
@entity234 pulled one back after @entity235 hit the crossbar , and the @entity237 had a late effort ruled out for offside as the @entity150 side ended the year just four points above the relegation zone in 14th place			0
@entity33 moved out of the bottom three after handing fellow strugglers @entity34 a third successive defeat that will increase the pressure on manager @entity247 after the 8 - 0 demolition by @entity149 and a 4 - 0 home loss to @entity19			1
@entity37 stayed second from bottom despite the promoted club winning for only the second time this season , thanks to a fifth - minute goal from @entity257 striker @entity256 that extended 12th - placed @entity39 's winless run to four matches .			0

@entity3 will go into 2013 with a seven - point lead in @entity2
