@entity0 -- a nun has died after setting herself on fire in southwestern @entity10 , the first @entity6 woman known to have killed herself in this way , the @entity4 - based @entity3 campaign group said tuesday			1
according to the group , @entity11 , 20 , called for religious freedom in @entity3 and for the return of the @entity15 as she set fire to herself outside @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 on monday			1
she died at the scene			0
the @entity21 in @entity22 told @entity1 they were not aware of the incident			2
@entity3 , which advocates @entity6 independence , also reported that two @entity6 were shot and wounded on sunday by security forces during a protest outside a police station in the prefecture of @entity29			1
@entity11 is the ninth @entity6 -- all monks or former monks -- to commit self - immolation in protest against @entity10 rule since march , the advocacy group said			1
the last attempt took place on saturday when a 19 - year - old former monk from @entity40 in @entity41 , another ethnic @entity6 area in @entity19 province , set himself alight in the central market in @entity44 but survived			2
his whereabouts are unknown , according to @entity3			0
activists say the disturbing acts reflect an increasingly repressive environment under @entity22 's control			1
" most tibetans live in fear because of suppressive and unfair government policies but they dare not speak up , " prominent @entity6 writer and activist @entity54 told @entity1			0
" @entity55 ca n't use violence to protest , therefore they can only do violence to themselves , such as self - immolation , to make people pay attention to their situation			1
" this is not suicide , this is sacrifice in order to draw the world 's attention			0
" another incident in @entity41 in march , in which a monk died , sparked weeks of often violent confrontation between local monks and authorities			0
security forces locked down the @entity40 and eventually detained more than 300 monks , rights groups said at the time			0
when the @entity81 working group on enforced disappearances expressed its concern to @entity22 , @entity10 officials called the organization 's perspective " biased and unfair			1
" " the relevant local authorities are conducting legal education for the @entity40 monks to maintain religious order there -- there was no question of forced disappearances , " @entity86 , a foreign ministry spokesman , said in june			0
@entity10 also rejects accusations of oppression of @entity6 , saying its rule has greatly improved living standards for the @entity6 people			0
the @entity15 's representative signed an agreement with @entity22 in 1951 to affirm @entity10 's sovereignty over @entity3 but also grant autonomy to the area			1
a failed uprising against @entity22 's rule in 1959 forced the @entity15 into exile			2
the @entity15 denies seeking independence for @entity3 , saying he wants genuine autonomy , under which @entity6 can make their own policies on key issues , such as religious practices			2
in a 2008 uprising , violent unrest in @entity3 and the subsequent military crackdown left at least 18 dead , and activists say tensions have remained high in many areas since then			2
