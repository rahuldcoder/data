-- when homeless mothers in @entity3 , @entity4 , need food , counseling or support , they can come to a rectangle - shaped cinderblock building just a few blocks from the @entity10			2
the building is home to @entity13 , a daytime homeless shelter			2
@entity15 is the executive director and it 's her job is to connect the women with social services			2
many of them need help finding nighttime shelter , counseling and food			2
for @entity28 , the @entity26 and children program is a key service			2
" it 's a wonderful program , an essential program , to feed these families , " she said			0
" baby formula , for example , is very expensive , and while we encourage women to breast feed , often they ca n't			0
breast feeding moms need extra calories , and many of the women we serve ca n't get those extra calories while they are homeless , even if they are on food stamps			0
" last year , 1,250 children came to @entity13 -- a 29 % increase			0
" it would make me sad to see fewer women eligible for @entity50 , " @entity28 said			1
" it just adds to the long list of services that have been cut the past two years			0
" this spike in demand at @entity13 and other social service programs across the country comes as @entity59 @entity58 want to cut @entity50 by 10 % as part of the 2011 federal budget plan passed last week , despite objections from @entity63 and @entity50 advocates			1
in addition to @entity50 , the @entity58 - controlled @entity59 also passed cuts to @entity67 , arts programs and heating subsidies for low - income households			1
@entity71 @entity63 are proposing their own cuts they say total about $ 41 billion , although those cuts are based on president @entity75 's 2011 budget , which has n't been passed			1
they floated a plan on thursday that goes beyond the $ 41 billion in cuts , but @entity58 quickly responded that the proposal still does n't cut deeply enough			1
@entity75 has threatened to veto any bill that undermines the ability of the @entity81 " to out - educate , out - build , and out - innovate the rest of the world			0
" @entity75 has made wic a spending priority , and is asking @entity85 to increase funding for the nutritional program for 2012			1
a spending plan must be approved by march 4 to avoid a government shutdown			1
even if the @entity63 @entity71 and @entity75 agree to @entity50 cuts , @entity50 has been running a surplus in 2011 , and that money could be used to fill any funding reduction			1
" the funding level that was provided last year ... turned out to be more than what 's needed , " explained @entity94 with the @entity95			1
" @entity99 did n't increase as much as was expected , " @entity98 said			0
" food prices ended up being lower than what was anticipated			0
and both because of the participation and lower than expected food costs , there are funds left over from 2010 that are available to be used			0
" one of the key reductions in food costs is the price of milk , which has declined by about a percentage point the past year			0
milk makes up about 20 % of @entity50 program expenditures			1
if @entity50 is cut , it would be the first time the program has ever been reduced solely because of ideological reasons , according to @entity98			1
" it 's definitely been a very popular program ... and there has been a very strong bipartisan commitment in the past to make sure nobody gets turned away , " @entity98 said			0
" the question going forward is whether that commitment will be adhered to			0

@entity50 has been running a surplus in 2011 , and that money could be used to fill any funding reduction
