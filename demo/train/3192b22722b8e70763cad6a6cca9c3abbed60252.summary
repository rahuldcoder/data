-- even for an employed schoolteacher like @entity3 , it is hard to find a bride these days			1
@entity3 is a shy , slender 36 - year old with a certain anxiety about him -- as if he has resigned to a fate that he is unable to change			1
he is very polite and at first , reluctant to talk about his situation			0
@entity3 is one of four sons and only one of his brothers has managed to get married			1
in his district in the state of @entity14 , there are only 858 girls born for every 1,000 boys , a ratio that does n't occur naturally without medical intervention			1
the northwestern state of @entity14 is home to one of the largest skewed sex ratios in @entity23			1
@entity24 : @entity23 's gender gap " only the rich and men with government jobs manage to get a bride these days , " he says			1
" anyone who earns less can not find a bride here anymore			1
" in @entity23 's conservative society , remaining a bachelor is not an option			1
a new bride would help his parents , he says			1
" they would have had an easier life			0
they would have had someone to cook and to take care of them			0
she should run the household			0
and @entity3 plans to share her with his two unmarried brothers , who live in the same house			1
but he can not find a bride in his village , where so few exist			2
so , he contacted an agent to find one from another state			0
@entity3 may be a victim of the heavily - skewed male sex ratio in his community ; more broadly , the desire to buy a bride is also fueling bride trafficking			1
decades of sex - selective abortion have created an acute lack of women in certain parts of @entity23			1
traffickers capitalize on the shortage by recruiting or kidnapping women ensnared in poverty to sell as brides			1
it 's a cycle influenced by poverty and medical technologies , but one that ultimately is perpetuated by @entity23 's attitude towards women			1
@entity23 grapples with rape and sexual violence where @entity23 's trafficked brides come from across the country , in the northeastern state of @entity81 , the sobs of a couple fill a hut made of mud and bamboo			1
an aging couple can not hold back their tears when they look at a passport - sized image of a dark - haired teenager , whose expression is washed out by water spots			2
this faded photo is all what 's left of @entity95 , their 16 - year - old daughter			2
@entity95 's family ended up in the village of mud houses at a safe distance from the @entity101 , after floods had destroyed their livelihood			0
the family retains a few of their possessions : pots , pans , a few goats and two @entity23 daybeds			1
they had no access to farmland and @entity95 's father earned a living by weaving baskets and mats out of straw			0
@entity95 disappeared more than two years ago from their makeshift settlement along the @entity101			0
she was last seen talking to a stranger on a rainy day			0
her parents ' hopes rest with @entity125 , a human rights activist , who has come to find out why more than 3,000 women went missing in the state of @entity81 in 2012			2
the @entity128 estimated in 2012 that about 10 women are kidnapped in @entity81 every day			1
some of these women are found again			2
eastern @entity23 states like @entity81 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 turn into source areas for bride trafficking , because they have much more balanced sex ratios			1
meanwhile , @entity23 's northwestern states are more conservative and also more affluent , meaning they 're able to afford ultrasound scans and selective abortions			1
@entity142 , a 14 - year - old girl , lives in a neighboring village , near @entity95 's family			2
in december 2012 , as a violent gang rape in @entity146 shocked the world , @entity142 was fetching water when she was kidnapped by a man on a motorbike			2
he took @entity142 to a house , locked her up and raped her over two days			0
only when the man said that he would sell her in @entity146 , did @entity142 muster the courage to escape			0
opinion : @entity23 can learn respect for women while @entity142 managed to escape her captor , she could not escape the blame her community cast on her			1
when her village found out about the attack , children started to tease her , making school a nightmare			0
nobody would hire her father , a day - laborer , so he has to venture ever further afield in search of work			2
during the interview , @entity142 's mother sat quietly in a corner , but did n't hide her opinions : that her daughter had brought shame on the whole family			0
@entity125 , the human rights advocate , says there is a cruel logic to this : rape is a means for the trafficker to exert power over their victims			0
and the social stigma attached to rape puts the victim in an even more vulnerable situation			0
@entity23 's northeastern states have all the ingredients for turning poor women into traffickers ' prey			1
the question is why ? opinion : where have @entity23 's females gone ? when everyone wants a son @entity23 's preference for sons transcends all religions and castes			1
" as fertility declines , people choose not only the number of children they have , but also choose the sex of the child , " says @entity204 , a prominent campaigner for women 's rights and an adviser to the government			2
" and everyone wants a son			0
" the skewed sex ratio is due to what @entity217 , a @entity146 suburb gynecologist , calls " mass murder on an unprecedented scale			0
" census data shows some districts in @entity23 have fewer than 800 girls born for every 1,000 boys , leaving male - heavy villages			1
a maverick amongst @entity23 's medical community , @entity217 accuses his colleagues of helping parents use ultrasound scans to determine the sex of the baby and abort females , because of a cultural preference for sons			1
if this practice does n't stop , @entity217 fears the worst for the future of @entity23			1
" the social fabric of society we accept as normal is unimaginable when a good 20 or 30 % of the women are missing , " he says			2
opinion : how terrible is it to be born a girl ? why such a strong preference for sons exists is a matter of heated debate			2
some point out that it is expensive to marry off daughters , because of the practice of dowry			0
although dowry is outlawed in @entity23 , this practice persists			1
others maintain that daughters only look after their in - laws , instead of their birth parents , when they grow old			2
@entity204 calls this pure myth			0
women have been shown to be much more reliable when it comes to looking after relatives or using their earnings responsibly , she says			2
" while working women send money back to their families , men hold back money for liquor , cigarettes and perhaps going to sex workers , too , " she says			2
the middle - class especially selects for sons , suggesting that economic development is n't likely to solve the problem , according to recent census data			2
when brides are sold although women are outnumbered by men in northwestern states , trafficked brides do not arrive into their new homes as prized wives			1
they have a name for the purchased brides -- paro -- which is derogatory for foreigner or stranger			0
we met 32 of them in a village of less than 1,000 people in the northeastern state of @entity294			2
@entity295 and her sister @entity296 are originally from @entity297			0
their family was so poor , they decided to sell them to a trafficker			0
the sisters are married to two brothers in a dusty village in @entity294			0
during their childhood in @entity297 , they recalled , on a few lucky days , there was money to go to the cinema			0
after being sold as brides , their lives are spent cooking , cleaning and working in the fields			0
they tell us of beatings and abuse			0
" even the village children talk to us like dogs , " the sisters say			0
faced with the allegations , the husbands maintain they paid more than $ 2,000 to traffickers , before they married the sisters			0
they emphasize that the men are stigmatized too , because they did n't manage to find a bride locally and instead had to buy one of the " paro " women			1
" patriarchy is so entrenched in our society			0
girls are unwelcome visitor ( s ) in our own homes , and that 's how they are treated , " says @entity204 , the activist			0
the men and women alike speak of their situation with surprising frankness			0
the public outrage after the @entity146 rape case has shown @entity23 's ability for self - criticism and the willingness of a significant part of its society to leave behind a deeply entrenched patriarchy			1
but this vicious cycle of aborting girls , kidnapping women and selling off brides continues -- the byproduct of a culture that sees sons as a blessing and daughters as a curse .			1

employed schoolteacher seeks to purchase bride and with the intention of sharing her with unmarried brothers
bride trafficking is part of a vicious cycle that aborts females and causes a shortage of women
fewer than 800 girls are born for every 1,000 boys in certain @entity23 states leaving male - heavy villages
shortage fuels bride trafficking where women are kidnapped and sold
