the chairman of the @entity2 says he has n't heard yet from former gov. @entity3 about his interest in the 2016 presidential race			1
" if it 's @entity8 and i still have n't heard from him i 'll be surprised , " @entity6 told the @entity7 on wednesday			2
while @entity3 campaigned for 2014 candidates last year , he did n't hit the early primary states like @entity12 and @entity13 , which hold the first two nominating contests and where other potential presidential contenders have already made frequent visits			1
the former @entity18 governor last month went to @entity19 , which holds the first - in - the - @entity19 primary , to speak to graduates at the @entity22 , but he has n't engaged in the traditional , on - the - ground retail politicking that 's expected in some of these early states			2
@entity3 only recently announced that he 's " actively " exploring a presidential bid , and his team and supporters have quickly started organizing behind the scenes to form political action committees that will help him travel to meet with voters and donors as he also campaigns for non-presidential candidates			1
his leadership @entity33 , @entity35 to rise , held its first fundraiser wednesday night in @entity37 , @entity38 , which was attended by former high profile figures in the administration of his brother , @entity41			0

@entity64 , a native @entity65 and conservative radio host , argued it 's a mistake for @entity3 to skip the @entity67 , which is hosted by rep. @entity68 and the conservative group @entity69			2
" if you 're not willing to speak to a conservative group that even @entity57 is willing to speak to , you 're probably in the wrong party , " @entity64 said in an interview			0
" if you do n't come here and let people see you -- this is true in both parties -- and let them rub elbows with you , you 're not going to win , " he added			0
the former governor , however , already has an advantage over the other candidates thanks to name recognition and ties to the @entity84 donor network			0
a recent @entity0 / @entity85 indicated @entity3 was the frontrunner of the crowded field of possible @entity2 candidates , with 23 % support			1
