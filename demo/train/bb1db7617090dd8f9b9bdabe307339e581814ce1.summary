@entity0 , @entity1 -- six months ago , an @entity1 bricklayer behind on his taxes wrote a note to his wife of 27 years , then doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire outside a @entity10 tax office			1
@entity11 died nine days later			1
" he was a good person , " said his widow , @entity12			0
" he was n't given a chance to redeem himself because that 's what he wanted to do			0
if @entity11 had had the chance , he would have paid his debt , not what they wanted him to pay because he was n't earning 20,000 euros a month			1
" she has joined with other women whose husbands took their lives to form a group called the " @entity25 " - the white widows - to show that in this long drawn out economic crisis , the cost can not be calculated on a tax form			1
@entity1 's " white widows " are the most recent example of the emotional toll the debt crisis and austerity measures are taking on @entity33			1
in the first half of last year , suicide rates in @entity36 skyrocketed more than 40 % year on year , according to @entity36 health ministry data			1
in the @entity49 -- not a part of the eurozone , but whose economy is also struggling as it enters a double - dip recession -- researchers wrote last month in the @entity45 that the 2008 - 2010 recession may have led more than 1,000 people to commit suicide			2
austerity drives up suicide rate in debt - ridden @entity36 now as @entity1 , the eurozone 's third largest economy , faces market pressure to make cuts after its borrowing costs rose dangerously high , " austerity suicides " that spiked in @entity36 are now being seen here			1
for decades , it was common for @entity1 to avoid paying their full taxes , but with the financial crisis , tax collection has become more aggressive			2
mounting tax troubles , and financial hardship , have driven some to take their lives			2
although statistics are hard to come by , one @entity1 small business association claims suicides related to economic hardship are twice what they were 10 years ago			1
@entity73 businessman @entity72 , 59 , shot himself in the chest last april			0
the factory he ran , which produced aluminum fittings , is now padlocked and its 10 workers unemployed			0
family tragedy tells the story of @entity36 @entity72 's daughter , @entity80 , worked with him and knew he was having financial difficulties , but had n't the slightest hint he was contemplating suicide			2
" the day before he killed himself , i said goodbye to him as i always did before going home , " she recalled			0
" i never read in his eyes any discomfort that would lead to this			0
after five months , i ca n't find a justification for what he did			0
" for the survivors of these economic suicides , there is anger that the government tried to maximize revenues and spending cuts , no matter the human cost			1
for @entity12 , she is left with questions of how to cope -- emotionally and financially -- in the aftermath of her husband 's death			0
" who will hire me at 48 - years - old , nearly 49 ? who ? " she asks			0
" where can i go ? should i become a prostitute ? because that 's where they 're taking us			0
or should i commit suicide and just get out of the way and be one less problem for the government ? " @entity2 's @entity121 contributed to this report			2

@entity11 set himself *ablaze* after not being able to pay a tax bill
wives of these " economic suicides " have formed a group , the " white widows "
suicide rates in @entity33 *nations* hard hit by the debt crisis are on the rise
