@entity2 @entity1 's voice wavers slightly as she recounts how her little boy became an @entity6 militant			1
every word seems tinged with anger and regret , but most of all , purpose			2
the process of radicalization is gradual and persuasive , she said			2
her son , who joined @entity6 's ranks in @entity16 , was killed in fighting there more than a year ago			1
" it 's so easy for them to get to our children , to access our children , " she said			0
@entity1 's son , @entity23 , converted to @entity24 after a troubling period in high school in @entity27 , @entity28			1
the mother remembers her son 's religion bringing him peace			2
she did n't suspect anything when @entity23 told her he was leaving for @entity34 to study @entity35			1
in reality , the 22 - year - old was in @entity16 alongside @entity6 fighters			1
he was killed during fighting near @entity41 in january 2014			1
( @entity41 was considered @entity16 's most dangerous city at the time , with intense fighting between government forces , rebels , and @entity6 militants )			1
how did her boy -- the one in photos kneeling by a christmas tree , or shirtless and raking leaves as a child , or sitting in a laundry basket as a toddler -- end up losing his life fighting for the creation of an @entity24 caliphate in the @entity58 ? @entity1 is now lending her support and voice to two organizations trying to combat radicalization			2
@entity63 and @entity64 are two new online resources for parents , teachers and communities to help counter extremist messages and recruitment			1
" the way a lot of it happens is one main recruiter plants the ideology in their mind and the @entity78 reinforces that with the information that they can search up and other contacts that they can make easily online , " @entity1 said			2
@entity28 have joined @entity6 to fight -- and die -- in @entity16 her message boils down to this , something reminiscent of anti-drug ads : talk to your kids about @entity6 before they do			1
" we need to start arming ourselves with the knowledge , the awareness , the education , and to be able to deal with these issues and be able to speak with our children at an early age , " @entity1 said			0
" we do the same thing with sex education , with drugs , and this is just one more thing that our kids are faced with , a challenge			0
" the lack of understanding and resources available to families like hers was devastating , she said			0
she was especially afraid for @entity23 's younger siblings			1
" we were living in a really desperate black hole of trauma and we did n't know how to heal from it , and i was terrified that the anger would burn within them and not being able to cope with this type of trauma and that they would follow the same path , " she said			0
while growing up in @entity27 , in @entity119 province , @entity1 remembers her son as a cuddly , warm and compassionate little boy			0
that changed in high school , when he experienced problems with peers and became withdrawn			0
he attempted suicide just after his 17th birthday , his mother said			2
after his recovery he converted to @entity24			0
" i saw some positive changes start to happen			0
the old @entity23 that i knew when he was younger , much younger , was starting to come out			1
he was socializing , he was peaceful , he was grounded , he was n't drinking , he was n't using drugs , there were lots of positive changes , " @entity1 said			0
but that changed when @entity23 moved out on his own , changed mosques and sought out more and more radical content online , his mother said			1
what @entity1 learned is while youths can become radicalized online , there is nothing to counter it or to provoke questions about what they are being told			2
" in fact , what 's out there is only something that can reinforce those ideas so we really need to start challenging the ideologies that are being placed in their minds , " @entity1 said			0
@entity28 security officials came to her door in 2013 , breaking the news that @entity23 was suspected of being a militant and was likely in @entity16 , not in @entity34			1
the next time she spoke on the phone with @entity23 , she confronted her son and he admitted that he was in @entity16			1
" he was compelled to go there to help save women and children to stop the torture , to stop @entity163 and that 's what drew him there and as he told me , ' i 'm finally doing something productive in my life , mum , ' " @entity1 said			0
she says her son was further brainwashed in @entity16 and the he eventually sided with @entity6 , believing they were the stronger group and he was more likely to survive fighting for them			1
@entity1 wishes the @entity28 government had the power then to do what it is doing now : confiscate passports of @entity28 suspected of communicating with terrorists			1
she wants the government to go even further , to detain and provide counseling and help to those being indoctrinated in extremism			0
there are families , she says , that are desperate as they see their children being drawn by jihadist propaganda			2
" the biggest problem we have is that parents -- a lot of the time -- want to be able to place the blame somewhere else , " she said			0
" we want think that our children are safe and it could never happen to us			0
it 's always going to happen to somebody else			0
that 's a big mistake we all make as parents			0

@entity23 left @entity28 to go fight alongside @entity6
he was killed in @entity16 last year during fighting
his mother now works to help fight extremist propaganda online
