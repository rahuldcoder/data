they come in all sizes and shapes , athletes do , small and tall , round and lean			2
they come with all kinds of personalities as well			2
some are cheerful as a cheerleader and sunny as a summer 's morn			2
they do more than just impress you , on the field or off ; they delight you			0
precious few have been the equal of @entity14 , when it comes to a combination of superhuman prowess plus an everyman 's way of coming across not as someone to idolize but more like your drop - by - for - coffee neighbor next door			1
when he died monday , cut down at 54 by a mouth cancer that spread , @entity23 mourned			0
@entity25 @entity14 dies the statistics of @entity14 are so off - the - chart absurd , they almost make a baseball lover laugh out loud : in the 20 seasons he played ( all for the same team , the @entity31 ) , he did not slug home runs the way @entity34 or @entity35 or @entity36 did ; on the contrary , a mere 135 homers in all that time ? @entity40 , you would think this @entity14 must have been a 98 - pound weakling , rather than the chubby - cheeked , tubby - tummied specimen that he was			1
what he did do was hit the ball			2
in his two decades , in 9,288 official at - bats , @entity14 struck out a grand total of 434 times			1
a pitcher could n't get a pitch by him			0
it was the old " like trying to throw a lamb chop past a wolf " kind of joke			0
you chucked it , @entity14 knocked it			1
a single to left , to center , to right , wherever he darn well pleased			0
he looked like a slow - pitch softball batter who decided to poke a ball anywhere he liked			2
except he did this against young , rock - abbed , iron - armed men who could hurl a hardball between 90 and 100 mph			2
@entity14 's lifetime tally of 3,141 hits exceeded that of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity34 , @entity71 , @entity72 ... his career batting average of .338 was the kind kids fantasize about when they are up - and - comers , watching videos of themselves , trying to learn how to hit			1
the ballpark figures this @entity79 etched into the game 's record books are exceptional			2
yet there was so much more to @entity14 : a perpetually happy and humble human being			1
a couple of examples , just to get the ball rolling : the year was 1984 and the @entity31 had made it to the @entity88 at last			0
game 1 was about to be played there in southernmost @entity91 , in a town known far more for its beauty than its baseball			1
@entity14 sat in a dugout , taking on all comers , talking to reporters and teammates and tv cameramen and vendors and batboys			1
" do n't you just love baseball ? " @entity14 asked at one point of no one in particular			1
he and the @entity31 were expected by many to lose to the @entity107 , a very strong team that year			0
" if we do lose , " @entity14 the non-tiger said , " hooray for the @entity107			1
somebody 's going to win , so if it ca n't be us , hooray for them			0
" do n't you just love that ? the lack of intensity , solemnity , fear that his observation would be interpreted in some negative way ? @entity121 , star of the opposing team , was the kind of guy who would have stared daggers at a teammate who fraternized with the enemy			0
@entity14 sought them out , trying to find @entity107 before the game , eager as a frisky puppy to make friends and then go play			1
he had a brother , name of @entity136 , who got to play on his team			0
in 1996 , the @entity31 were up north in @entity14 's birthplace of @entity139 for a big game			1
it was decided on a clutch 11th - inning double by a pinch - hitter -- yep , @entity142 , the lesser of the @entity14 brothers historically , and it won the division championship for the @entity31			1
" are n't you @entity142 's brother ? " a reporter joked			0
" i am today ! " @entity14 exulted			1
he loved pretty much everybody			0
including his own son , @entity150 , who also made it to the major leagues			0
brother and son might not have been in @entity156 ( as it were ) , but those @entity157 , they could play this game			2
@entity14 was succinct and sincere on @entity159 when the bad news came monday : " today i lost my @entity161 , my best friend and my mentor			1
i 'm gon na miss u so much , pops			0
" @entity14 and a habit all too common in baseball he had a cherubic face and a soft and nasal voice , a little bit @entity169 , a little bit @entity171			1
he had the torso of a nonathlete and his cheeks were puffed by smokeless tobacco , a habit that likely killed him			0
he endured oral surgery in 2010 and again in 2012 , and there had been a growing dread that his days were numbered			0
@entity14 is gone ? say it ai n't so			1
he did n't play for @entity181 or @entity182 or @entity183			0
but he played for all of us , watching him with that bat , waggling it , digging in , smacking a ball where it could n't be caught			0
he would smile , patting the other side 's fielder on the back , while the rest of us turned to each other , shook our heads and said something like , " man , that guy can hit			2

@entity202 : @entity14 had *dazzling* baseball , but he kept his *humility* , common touch
he says in 9,288 official at - bats , he struck out 434 times . you threw it , @entity14 hit it
but he had something more , he says . he seemed *eternally* happy , *sociable* , without airs
@entity202 : he took *obvious* joy in the game and the *trappings* . baseball mourns his loss
