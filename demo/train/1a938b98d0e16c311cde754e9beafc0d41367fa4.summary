-- here 's a big idea that needs to sink in quickly : car crashes and motorcycle accidents are symptoms of a disease , and it 's high time we started looking at killer roads as a public health crisis -- or " pandemic , " as the @entity10 put it recently			1
we think of @entity12 and malaria as the big bad killer illnesses			1
they are among them , of course			2
but they 've also got the advantage of having the world 's attention			1
meanwhile , as the developing world continues to build more roads and buy more cars , road traffic deaths have emerged as a new and growing crisis -- one that 's a threat to global public health			1
" in the developing world , in a very short time , ( road deaths ) are going to leapfrog past all of these more famous diseases and will be the no. 5 killer in the developing world , " said @entity30 , a senior editor at the @entity10 , which launched an extensive project in august called " @entity32			1
" that switch will happen , according to @entity39 data , because malaria and @entity12 are becoming less likely to kill a person , while deaths from road traffic accidents are expected to increase in coming decades			1
the ongoing @entity10 project highlights sobering facts : roads kill 1.24 million people each year , and by 2030 , that annual number is expected to jump to 3.6 million			1
sometimes laws are the problem			1
for instance , @entity51 only recently started requiring new drivers to pass tests			2
more often , it seems , enforcement is a culprit			0
@entity57 requires seat belts for front and back seat passengers , the center reports			0
but it got a rating of only 1 on a scale of 1 to 10 for enforcement , with 10 being the best			0
meanwhile , front seat passengers who wear seat belts reduce their risk of dying in a crash by 40 % to 50 % , according to the @entity39			1
the @entity69 has just about the highest number of road traffic deaths per capita , according to the @entity39			1
" travel at night on intercity highways and in rural areas should be avoided , due to animals on the road , poor road conditions , poor lane markers , missing manhole covers , large potholes , unmarked speed bumps , and other vehicles being driven at excessive speeds , often with malfunctioning headlights or taillights , " the @entity72 says on its website for travelers to the @entity69			0
" drivers should be aware that road hazards and closures are often indicated by piles of debris littered across the roadway , without any lettered signs or reflective surfaces to help call attention to the road condition			0
often times , there is no indication of the road hazard whatsoever			0
" @entity103 has the highest total number of road deaths			1
in many developing countries , @entity30 told me , traffic cops are on foot -- meaning they ca n't chase down speeding cars			1
" you could run a red light or speed with impunity , " he said			0
motorcycles in @entity116 often carry entire families			0
that 's got to create balance issues , and not everyone wears a helmet			2
" a lot of these countries have helmet laws -- so the driver wears a helmet , " he said , " but his wife and two children do n't			1
" saddest of all is that , like many other killers , unsafe roads primarily are victimizing people in poorer countries			1
income inequality factors in , too			0
" if you 're the rich guy in an suv and you hit a child on a bicycle , you just take off " in some countries with weak law enforcement , @entity30 said			2
" or you pay a small fine			0
" if road deaths are part of a disease , we know the cure			1
countries like the @entity149 and @entity150 have greatly lowered their rates of road deaths , in part with smart safety laws and levels of traffic enforcement that do n't exist in some other nations			1
@entity150 used to be a country of " reckless drivers , " the @entity10 writes			0
" but strict enforcement of safe driving laws resulted in an 80 % decline in road fatalities " over several decades			2
in the @entity149 , the rate of road deaths per 100,000 people was 15.64 in 1994 , according to the @entity166			1
that rate had declined to 10.39 by 2011			0
one of the most interesting things about the @entity10 project is it has kickstarted conversations about road safety all over the world			1
@entity174 , a web developer at the @entity10 , told me people from @entity177 to @entity57 have been talking about it			2
" it was big in @entity180 for a couple days , " he said			0
these conversations need to happen , in part because of the increasing death toll , but also because solutions are relatively simple , especially compared to more stubborn global health problems like malaria , which also is a worthy issue			1
road deaths should roll onto the global radar			2
that 's where you come in			2
everyone has a story about a dangerous road in the town or a traffic law they 'd love to see changed			0
take a look at the @entity10 report -- it has a map where you can look up your country -- and tweet about what you want to change , or what you 've experienced on the roads in the place where you live			2
the group suggests using the hashtag # roadskill			0
i 'll do the same			0
i may tweet about how i 've been on buses in @entity211 that turn their lights off at night because they think they 're saving gas			0
or about the driver in @entity218 who ran into me while i was biking because he did n't yield on a left turn			0
no one anecdote will solve this problem , but the more we talk about it the closer we 'll get			0
and if @entity224 is n't your thing , i 'd love to hear your road stories in the comments section below			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity231 .			0

roads kill 1.24 million people per year , according to the @entity39
a new project highlights the deaths as part of a public health " pandemic "
@entity242 : it 's time for the world to address this crisis
he asks *readers* to share stories about bad roads and laws in their countries
