-- as video game players , our focus often falls on the freshest , most exciting new digital diversions			1
but much as we 're all looking forward to hearing more about " @entity6 " and " @entity7 " at the @entity9 trade show this week , it pays to remember : these titles stand on the shoulders of giants			2
for every exciting new present - day debut , dozens of predecessors helped pave the way for their bar - raising delivery or game - play innovations			2
consider the following list , which highlights 10 of the last decade 's best and most influential games			1
it may be hard to recall their place in history amidst a sea of splashy trailers for " @entity26 " or " @entity27			0
" but take our word for it : on the eve of potentially mind - blowing outings from " @entity34 " to " @entity35 : @entity43 , " the modern era 's most acclaimed titles would n't be here today if it was n't for the pioneering efforts of these 10 games , making each worth dusting off and replaying as a reminder of just how far we 've come			1
what are your favorite video games ? " @entity47 " ( @entity49 / @entity48 , pc -- 2000 ) -- an interactive dollhouse filled with little computer people that 's among the first games to recreate reality itself			1
not only did the cleverly disguised strategy title open the door for modern classics like evolutionary simulator " @entity59 , " but its familiar settings and relevant topic also showed that electronic amusements could resonate with all ages and genders ( a precursor to today 's casual / social gaming sensations ) , making it the best - selling pc game of all time			1
" @entity71 " ( @entity72 , pc / @entity73 / 360 -- 2007 ) -- @entity74 , brooding and sinister , this hybrid role - playing game and first - person shooter ( wherein you wander a mutant - infested , capsizing undersea art deco utopia ) wowed as much for its @entity82 - level script writing as haunting environs			2
equally impressive was one 's ability to use guns and customizable genetic superpowers in endless combinations to uncover the secrets of a world as rich as any of its tragically flawed characters			2
" @entity93 " ( @entity94 , @entity73 / @entity95 -- 2001 ) -- never mind critics and their sensationalist propaganda			0
among the earliest @entity100 " sandbox , " or open - ended , tales to let players go anywhere and do anything in a world of outsized personalities and adventures , this underworld saga is notable most for popularizing freedom of choice as a gameplay concept			0
an engaging plotline and memorable characters did n't hurt the epic 's street cred either , as expounded upon in later installments such as the celebrated " @entity116 : @entity117 " and " @entity116 : @entity118			1
" " @entity119 " ( @entity120 , @entity121 -- 2001 ) -- the sci - fi , run ' n ' gun juggernaut single - handedly established the @entity121 as a force to be reckoned with and , via sequel " @entity125 , " paved the way for trigger - happy experiences to provide living rooms worldwide with endless online thrills			1
with blockbuster production values and comprehensive internet play suites now staples for the genre , it picked up where " @entity136 " and " @entity137 " left off in helping bring smack - talking gunplay to mainstream prominence			0
in retrospect , it 's hard to believe we ever doubted that first - person shooters could make the transition from @entity73 to tv			2
" @entity144 " ( @entity145 , @entity147 / @entity95 / pc / @entity146 -- 2005 ) -- prior to this pant - soiling epic 's debut , fear was typically an emotion experienced by gamers only upon discovering that a younger sibling had accidentally deleted their most recent saved game			1
but via spine - chillingly atmospheric scenarios featuring homicidal villagers , mad monks and chainsaw - wielding maniacs , each creepier and more breathless than the last , it illustrated gaming 's true potential to induce cardiac arrest			2
" @entity163 " ( @entity164 , @entity95 -- 2005 ) -- melding heavy metal sensibilities with @entity168 mythology , this button - mashing odyssey invited players to gleefully lop off heads and wrench eyeballs from monsters ' sockets			1
look past the gore - drenched melodramatics though , and you 'll also find incredibly polished play mechanics and skillful scriptwriting that demonstrated a simple principle			0
specifically , that modern - day epics could ( * gasp * ) offer a heady mix of brains as well as brawn			0
" @entity184 " ( @entity185 , @entity95 -- 2005 ) -- from " @entity186 " to " @entity187 , " music always had its place in the gaming canon			0
however , by pairing an intuitive plastic guitar controller with the on - screen action , it was here that we first saw the two mediums successfully collide with chart - topping results			0
the billion - dollar franchise has since spawned multiple spin - offs and imitators ; established an entire genre ; become @entity204 's new happy - hour activity of choice ; and legitimized video games as today 's hottest new medium for connecting fans and musicians			1
encore ! " @entity210 : @entity210 " ( @entity211 , pc / @entity73 / 360 -- 2006 ) -- as a freeform fantasy role - playing franchise that players could explore in nonlinear fashion , " the @entity213 " series was n't the first or even best of its kind when it debuted in 1994			0
upon reaching the @entity220 though , fans hungry for killer apps were astonished by the game 's depth , scope and ambition , which set the bar for later like - minded smashes , e.g. " @entity227 " and " @entity228			1
" " @entity229 " ( @entity164 , @entity95 -- 2005 ) -- most games offer an array of slavering , faceless horrors , which players are invited to casually butcher in offhanded fashion			0
but in this action - packed epic , the high - tech equivalent of an art house film , you instead play a swordsman who must scale and slay brooding titans who both function as living levels and reminders of one 's own mortality			0
@entity249 has virtual death seemed so dignified			0
" @entity251 " ( @entity252 , @entity73 -- 2004 ) -- call them massively multiplayer online games ( mmos ) , virtual worlds or glorified 3 - d chat rooms			0
but with more than 11.5 million worldwide subscribers , none makes a stronger case for the value of blending community and socialization with compelling , internet - based play			0
based on the popular series of real - time strategy games , it 's helped bring fantasy dungeon crawling ( and spending hours on your pc romancing sultry night elves ) to mainstream acceptance			1
