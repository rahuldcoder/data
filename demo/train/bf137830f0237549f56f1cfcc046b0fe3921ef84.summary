-- @entity1 is installing a feature in its new vehicles -- and many of its older ones -- that can read text messages out loud			1
the feature , which is intended to reduce texting while driving , is part of @entity1 's voice - activated technology , @entity10 , and is already installed on all model 2012 @entity1 vehicles with the exception of the @entity14			1
using a @entity17 connection , it syncs with phones and alerts users when they receive text messages , reads them out loud and allows users to respond with a selection of standard pre-written messages without taking their hands off the wheel			1
on tuesday , it will be made available as an upgrade to @entity10 vehicles that are model 2010 or later			2
in order to install the capability , owners can download the upgrade from the @entity10 site onto a usb drive along with print - out instructions			1
older @entity1 vehicles that have @entity10 will soon be able to make the update as well , says supervisor of sync product development @entity40			1
we should n't need data to convince us that texting and driving at the same time is a bad idea			1
but we have tons of it			2
a 2009 study from the @entity49 found that texting while driving increased the risk of a truck getting into an accident by more than 23 times			2
a 2007 @entity56 study found that text messaging and @entity58 caused drivers to leave their lane 10 % more often during driving simulations			0
and if you have doubts that texting is detrimental to driving performance , you can prove it to yourself with an interactive game that the @entity68 has created to make the point			2
so in an age when most car companies have a @entity17 integration features , why is n't text - to - voice already a standard option ? several apps such as @entity76 and @entity77 have created popular solutions , but only a few vehicle manufacturers such as @entity1 and @entity80 have integrated the feature into vehicles themselves			1
one factor in the slow adoption is that not many phones integrate with text - to - speech features like @entity1 's			0
so far @entity89 phones are the most notable devices compatible with the technology required			0
some @entity93 phones also support the technology			0
@entity40 says that he thinks more phone and vehicle manufacturers will soon start to add it			0
" it 's very similar to a couple of years ago when @entity17 devices were just coming out and had a hands - free profile [ for integrating with vehicles ] and few phones supported it , " he says			0
" now it 's almost standard			0
