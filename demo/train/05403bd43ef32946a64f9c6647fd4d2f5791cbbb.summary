-- @entity1 scored in the last minute of stoppage - time to claim a 3 - 3 draw against @entity3 in the @entity4 at @entity5 on saturday			1
@entity3 , who did not field the former @entity1 player @entity7 , looked to be cruising to a comfortable 3 - 1 victory after goals from @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 had erased @entity14 's opener for @entity1			1
but with 90 minutes up , @entity1 scored two late goals , the first a header from @entity17 and the second by @entity18 , to secure a point for @entity1 manager @entity21 's men			2
@entity1 , who were third from the bottom of the table at the start of the day , had taken the lead on 39 minutes when a misjudged clearance from @entity3 defender @entity28 left @entity18 clear on goal			1
@entity18 's effort was saved by @entity31 , but @entity32 found the unmarked @entity14 who guided the ball to the back of the net			0
but @entity1 's advantage was short - lived as @entity3 swept forward and found an equalizer moments later			1
the @entity39 winger @entity38 curled a cross from the right into the danger area and @entity10 popped up to steer home the leveler			0
@entity3 maintained their momentum after the restart and @entity38 was the creator once more , his pinpoint cross picking out @entity11 whose downward header flew past @entity49 in the @entity1 goal			2
@entity51 seemed all but assured on 66 minutes when @entity52 split the @entity1 defense to release @entity12 , who controlled before burying a low shot beyond @entity49			2
but @entity17 's header gave @entity1 hope and moments later @entity18 's deflected shot flew in to give the home side an improbable point in what was sir @entity63 's 700th @entity4 game as a manager			2
@entity63 said : " @entity65 can do that to you			0
in a game of a completely comfortable position we 've thrown it away , simple as that			0
" meanwhile @entity4 leaders @entity73 maintained their perfect start to the season with a 3 - 1 win over @entity78			1
two goals from @entity80 and a @entity82 strike helped the @entity83 to a relatively comfortable win against a struggling @entity78 at @entity85 , @entity86			0
@entity88 's men preserved their two - point lead at the top of the table with their fourth win of the season , condemning @entity78 to their fourth defeat and a place at the bottom of the table			2
@entity98 stayed in touch at the top with a 4 - 1 rout of 10 - man @entity102 at the @entity104 in @entity105 , with summer signings @entity106 and @entity108 both getting on the scoresheet for @entity111 's side			1
@entity106 had fired the @entity112 , second in the table , into a 1 - 0 lead on 24 minutes but wanderers hit back through @entity116 on the stroke of half time after good work by @entity119 international @entity120			1
@entity121 international @entity108 restored @entity98 's lead however , capitalizing on good work from skipper @entity124			0
@entity102 's task was made harder when @entity126 was given a straight red card for a wild lunge on @entity108 before goals from @entity130 and and @entity131 sealed the points			0
at @entity135 , @entity134 's faltering form continued as they were held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity137			1
a dreadful mix - up between @entity139 goalkeeper @entity138 and @entity140 saw @entity134 fall behind , @entity142 sneaking in to put @entity137 1 - 0 up			1
however @entity134 got back on level terms early in the second half when former @entity146 international @entity145 netted a vital equalizer for @entity149 's team			0
newly promoted @entity150 earned their second victory of the season with a 2 - 0 defeat of @entity154 at @entity155			0
a @entity157 penalty and a late goal on the counter from @entity160 helped @entity162 's @entity161 to all three points .			0
