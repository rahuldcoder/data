-- on sunday , @entity1 will go to the polls to elect a new president three months after the ouster of corrupt former president @entity5			0
we will be there in @entity1 to observe the elections as members of an @entity11 delegation , witnessing a vote that is an important step not only for the @entity1 people 's struggle for democracy , but for the entire region 's hopes for long - term stability and democratic development			1
in the lead - up to this critical vote , pro-russian separatists , taking their cues from an increasingly aggressive @entity24 , have attempted to undermine the elections in parts of eastern and southern @entity1 through threats and violence			0
in @entity30 and @entity31 , separatist leaders announced they will not participate in the presidential elections , while heavily armed militia fighters seize control of election offices and government buildings			2
@entity38 president @entity39 has publicly called the election " a step in the right direction , " but tens of thousands of @entity38 troops remain near the @entity1 border , @entity38 intelligence forces continue operating in eastern @entity1 and @entity39 has been noncommittal about whether his government will recognize the outcome of the presidential vote			1
as other countries in the region can attest , @entity38 interference in territorial sovereignty is nothing new			2
since 1992 , long before @entity39 came to power , @entity38 has occupied parts of @entity55 , and for many years @entity24 fostered a breakaway rebellion on @entity58 soil , which eventually led to war in 2008			1
shortly before this year 's @entity61 , @entity38 forces used the pretext of security for the games to advance miles farther into @entity58 , pledging to return to the ceasefire lines once the @entity66 had ended			2
instead , @entity38 's military has fortified its gains in @entity58 and shows no indication of withdrawal			1
@entity39 understands that successful elections and a new government committed to democratic ideals and anti-corruption will have a ripple effect throughout the region , including @entity38			1
in a recent interview , @entity58 defense minister @entity77 said , " if they [ @entity1 ] survive this crisis there will be a future for all the countries in the region that border @entity38			1
" that is why @entity39 has undertaken extraordinary measures to undermine @entity88 's effort to solidify its status as a sovereign , independent , and democratic nation			0
to deter @entity39 's aggression , the @entity91 must inflict immediate and serious economic consequences on @entity38 's financial , energy , and defense sectors			1
we must also expand and strengthen sanctions on @entity38 officials who were involved in the illegal annexation of @entity101			0
and @entity39 must know that additional acts of aggression will be met with even greater costs			0
the vast majority of @entity1 -- like the citizens of so many countries in the region -- envision their future as a united democracy , free from foreign intervention and intimidation , and integrated with the rest of @entity114			2
it is critical that @entity117 nations support these aspirations through democratic assistance and economic development programs that support the new @entity1 government as it enacts political and economic reforms to root out corruption , restore the rule of law and promote growth and prosperity for the @entity1 people			0
the @entity91 and our @entity129 allies must not allow @entity39 to continue to meddle in @entity1 affairs and use the specter of military aggression to undermine the safety and liberty of millions of people seeking democracy in the region			1
it is our responsibility to stand with the @entity1 people and their aspiration to live in a free and democratic society without fear of repression			0
join us on @entity146 / @entity145 .			0

sen. @entity148 and rep. @entity149 are in @entity1 for the presidential elections
they feel @entity38 's continued interference in the region undermines democracy
@entity39 has been *deliberately* seizing ground in @entity58 and @entity1
they say the @entity91 must not allow @entity39 to use force to meddle in @entity1 affairs
