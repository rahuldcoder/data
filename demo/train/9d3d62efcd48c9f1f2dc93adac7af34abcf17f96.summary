-- while many people get their @entity5 's countdown clocks ready , @entity2 's family is scrambling as a darker deadline looms			1
a judge 's ruling will allow a hospital to disconnect life support machines at 5 p.m. monday from the 13 - year - old girl , whom doctors declared brain dead after she suffered complications from tonsil surgery earlier this month			1
@entity2 's family , who wants to transfer her somewhere else , told @entity0 affiliate @entity17 that they spent sunday working the phones , trying to line up another option			1
the case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital that treated her should have provided better care			0
medical ethicists , meanwhile , say the high - profile case fuels a misperception : that " brain death " is somehow not as final as cardiac death , even though , by definition , it is			2
the case is " giving the impression that dead people can come back to life , " @entity35 , director of the @entity36 at @entity37 , told @entity0 last week			0
but @entity2 's family members maintain that they 're hoping for a miracle and want to transfer the girl from @entity44 to another facility			1
a statement released by family members saturday and provided to @entity17 says they are weighing several options			0
" our attorney is in discussions with two facilities that have expressed preliminary approval for accepting @entity2 on a ventilator , " the statement said			2
" one is in @entity56 , the other is in @entity58			0
" @entity59 , an attorney representing @entity44 , said in a letter to the family 's lawyer sunday that officials are still awaiting specifics from the family			2
" to date , there has been no communication from any facility named by you regarding a transfer or requirements for transfer with any of the medical professionals at @entity74			2
the family has not identified any facility with which children 's can have this dialogue			2
nor have we been provided with a transportation plan or coroner authorization , " he wrote			0
" as your email and your statements about the facility in the @entity87 area acknowledge , discussion about performing medical procedures upon a dead body presents unusual and complicated questions			2
until there is a definite commitment by a facility to accept @entity2 's body upon specified terms , i do n't think i can tackle those issues			1
please let me know if the family is able to identify a facility			0
" when ' life support ' is really ' death support ' @entity2 was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on december 12 , three days after tonsil surgery			1
family members and hospital officials fought over her future in court			0
last week , a judge ruled she was brain dead and urged both sides to work together to resolves the situation			1
but the sparring showed no sign of slowing over the weekend , with family members sharply criticizing the hospital 's handling of the matter			0
" we wish to acknowledge that @entity2 's case , and our stance regarding her right to life , and her mother 's right to make decisions regarding her child , has stirred a vibrant , sometimes polarizing , national debate			1
this was never our intention , " the family 's statement said			0
" we have our strong religious convictions and set of beliefs and we believe that , in this country , a parent has the right to make decisions concerning the existence of their child : not a doctor who looks only at lines on a paper , or reads the cold black and white words on a law that says ' brain dead ' and definitely not a doctor who runs the facility that caused the brain death in the first place			1
" the hospital 's statement sunday said they were supporting @entity2 's family			1
" we continue to do so despite their lawyer 's criticizing the very hospital that all along has been working hard to be accommodating to this grieving family , " the hospital said			0
when routine surgeries go wrong @entity0 's @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
