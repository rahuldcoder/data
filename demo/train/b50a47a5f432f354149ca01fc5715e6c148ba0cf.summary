the second most - dreaded question for new parents after " is your baby sleeping ? " is " where does he sleep ? " some say a baby should never sleep in the same bed as you , while others say it 's the only way to go			1
that 's because the response is usually just as complicated and the people who ask are often ready to pass judgment on it			0
at least , that 's what more than 6,000 of you told us in our national survey about sleep habits , in which we set out to determine the differences between parents who put their babies down to sleep at night in a crib ( for convenience 's sake , we 're calling them " crib - sleepers " ) and those who share a family bed with their children ( co-sleepers )			1
here , an illuminating peek into the night lives of new families : " now , that 's crazy ! " when we were creating this survey , we imagined a giant pillow fight , with moms on one side of the bed yelling " safety ! " and a posse on the other shouting " bonding ! " and we did hear those battle cries : nearly half of all crib - sleepers admitted that they think co-sleepers are " irresponsible " and that parents who share a family bed are " putting their baby 's life at risk			1
" parenting.com : guide to baby sleep another 39 percent think that co-sleeping parents are spoiling their baby			1
" i know people who still have a three - year - old in bed with them because the kid wo n't sleep alone			1
now , that 's crazy ! " exclaims @entity73 , a mom of two in @entity75 , @entity76			0
" come on , people , you are only making it hard on the kids by keeping them in the bed with you			2
" another crib proponent , @entity83 of @entity84 , @entity85 , considers co-sleeping to be " the easy option			2
" " i never brought my kids into my bed -- even though it would have been easier			2
i believe they 're safer in their own crib			0
" so what about the safety issue ? in a 2005 policy statement , the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) warned that bed - sharing was associated with an increase in sudden infant death syndrome ( @entity100 ) and strongly recommended against the practice			1
" there is no evidence that co-sleeping can be done safely , " adds @entity102 , @entity103 , chairperson of the @entity95 's @entity104 on @entity100			1
parenting.com : baby sleep strategies no wonder moms who co-sleep are twice as likely to feel judged compared with crib - sleepers			2
in their defense , co-sleepers cite the work of @entity115 , @entity116 , an anthropologist whose research shows sids rates to be lower in countries where co-sleeping is the norm , and the attachment - parenting theories of @entity125 contributing editor @entity124 , @entity103 ( both experts believe parents can -- and must -- co-sleep safely ; see @entity128 for guidelines			1
) parenting.com : why are infants still dying from @entity100 ? in fact , co-sleepers were just as likely to choose their sleeping arrangement for safety reasons as crib - sleepers			0
and they also slung some arrows : 40 percent of moms who planned to co-sleep believe that parents who use a crib wo n't have as close a bond with their babies as they do ; another 20 percent feel that crib - sleepers are " selfish " and " only thinking of their own sleep			1
" " babies grow up more secure when they sleep with their moms for the first year of their lives , " contends @entity147 of @entity148 , @entity149			2
parenting.com : learning to sleep solo giving up control the majority of parents agreed , however , that in the quest for rest , one size does not fit all babies			0
" after having three children , " @entity162 of @entity163 , @entity164 , told us , " i have learned that you have to do whatever is necessary to help your children sleep			0
" and for many of you , that means changing your game plan			0
according to our results , only 11 percent of moms actually planned to co-sleep with their babies , but a whopping 42 percent ended up doing so once their little bundles arrived ( see " @entity177 " on the previous page )			1
" during my pregnancy , i studied controversial topics , such as co-sleeping , and thought i knew what i would do , " shared one reader in @entity180 , who swore that she would n't co-sleep but now spends every night in bed with her 5 - month - old daughter			2
" but children set their own schedules			0
i never understood that having a baby means giving up complete control			0
" parenting.com : dreaming of sleep the perfect sleep solution for all the stress that surrounds getting your baby to sleep , it 's helpful to remember -- in a twisted sort of way , we admit -- that 51 percent of you report being tired all the time , regardless of whether your tot snoozes in a crib or in your bed			1
in other words , there 's no right or wrong answer to that frustrating question " where does your baby sleep ? " as @entity216 of @entity217 , @entity218 , said , " i hope this survey helps parents understand that there is no perfect sleep solution			1
if there is , please let me know what it is			0
