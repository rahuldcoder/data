@entity0 -- like many other 18 - year - olds , @entity2 is on the point of graduating from high school			2
unlike her peers , she has spent more than half her short life fighting to prevent the destruction of her home , culture and indigenous community in the interests of oil exploration			0
@entity15 women 's rights activist @entity14 , 50 , has been arrested 43 times in the course of peaceful protest activities and now faces criminal charges she says are trumped up by the authorities			1
@entity21 , who took part in protests in @entity24 last year before leaving his homeland for the @entity26 , now works with other young @entity27 to give nonviolent support for the pro-democracy movement			2
they are just three of the protesters who through their actions have helped make 2011 a " truly tumultuous year , " in the words of @entity35 's 50th annual report on the state of global human rights , released thursday			1
the dramatic scenes of the @entity39 have kept protesters in the @entity41 and @entity42 in the headlines , especially as voters in @entity45 take part in a landmark presidential election this week			2
but @entity35 also lauds the often unseen efforts of demonstrators elsewhere in @entity42 , @entity50 , @entity51 and the @entity52 last year			1
at the same time , the rights group is scathing in its criticism of a " failure of leadership " at local and international level , saying those in power have left protest movements to fend for themselves as they take on tyranny and injustice			1
" failed leadership has gone global in the last year , with politicians responding to protests with brutality or indifference , " said @entity65 , @entity35 secretary general , launching the report in @entity0			1
" governments must show legitimate leadership and reject injustice by protecting the powerless and restraining the powerful			2
it is time to put people before corporations and rights before profits			1
" @entity65 singled out the @entity80 for its failure to act effectively in both @entity27 and @entity82 , saying it left the body seeming " tired , out of step and increasingly unfit for purpose			1
" " in the last year it has all too often become clear that opportunistic alliances and financial interests have trumped human rights as global powers jockey for influence in the @entity41 and @entity42 , " said @entity65			1
" the language of human rights is adopted when it serves political or corporate agendas , and shelved when inconvenient or standing in the way of profit			1
" forced to move from a remote corner of the @entity100 @entity99 to @entity101 four years ago amid death threats following her community 's opposition to the planned oil project , @entity2 has been part of the fight to preserve the way of life of the indigenous @entity111 people of @entity112 since she was 7 or 8 years old			1
that was when she heard a representative of the oil company that wants to develop their community 's pristine land -- a project @entity35 says is backed by the government -- offer just $ 60,000 in return , or roughly $ 15 per person			1
" i was just a child but i understood that i would never give up my land , " @entity2 said			0
" i wanted to ask him why he was trying to give me $ 15 to destroy my land and drive me out of there			0
i think that was the first moment when i realized that this was going to be a very long struggle			0
" for four years after they fled to @entity101 , it was too dangerous for the family to return to their homeland			0
" to know we could n't go back to see my family , my village -- it was horrible , horrible , " said @entity2 , who is now able to travel home once or twice a year			2
but despite the obstacles they have faced , @entity2 and her mother , @entity141 , have helped take their community 's decade - long battle all the way to the @entity146 in @entity147			1
now they are anxiously awaiting its judgment , expected in the coming months			0
that verdict could impact on thousands of indigenous communities in @entity100 and beyond who want their governments to adhere to international human rights law that requires them to consult with indigenous peoples before giving developments on their land the go - ahead			1
@entity141 said the arrival of oil companies on their land would have meant " the end of our culture and our way of life			0
" the indigenous community has used the @entity169 to get its message out to the international community , @entity2 said , in an echo of protest movements elsewhere			0
and witnessing the @entity39 movement has helped the @entity112 people in their struggle			2
young upstarts plotting @entity41 art revolution " i feel very inspired when i see in the news other people doing similar things to us , " said @entity141			0
" before we used to feel very alone ... and now we can see that we are not the only ones , so that definitely brings hope			0
" for @entity14 , the revolutions of the @entity39 have been both an inspiration and a driver for the @entity15 government 's increasingly harsh crackdown on protests at home			0
as executive director and founding member of @entity195 ( @entity195 ) , she leads a movement of 80,000 human rights activists who seek to improve the everyday lives of the southern @entity202 nation 's women			1
she accuses the authorities under president @entity204 , who has ruled @entity15 for 32 years , of misusing their powers to suppress protest and hold onto power , through arrests and intimidation			0
" that 's how these dictators are entrenching themselves , and we , the activists , have to find a response to that , " @entity14 said			2
" how do you dodge a bullet and make a ballot count ? " @entity35 's report highlights the arrests , detention and torture of human rights defenders by a partisan police force who , it says , failed to take action against members of @entity204 's @entity228 when they " harassed , intimidated or beat up perceived political opponents			1
" " @entity39 has been an inspiration , but since that we 've been viewed as a national security threat , " @entity14 said			0
" we are a women 's movement using peaceful protests but it has ( led to ) increased monitoring , surveillance and charges against us			0
" nonetheless , she and others will continue to make a stand for justice and equality for women , she said			0
@entity21 of the @entity243 is similarly determined , despite the unrest that continues to wrack @entity27 more than a year after the government 's crackdown on protest first began			2
" we see that people are still demonstrating , they still have hope for change , and they still insist on going out in the streets regardless of all the danger they face , " he said			0
@entity35 says " inaction over crimes against humanity in @entity27 " -- owing in large part to the vetoes wielded by @entity259 and @entity260 -- has left the @entity80 " looking redundant as a guardian of global peace			1
" and it challenges the @entity263 to do better when it meets to agree an arms trade treaty in july , saying this is the " acid test for politicians to place rights over self - interest and profit			2
" millions of people around the world have marched in defense of human rights , @entity35 says , and it 's time for the world 's leaders to step up to the plate			1
" protesters have shown that change is possible			0
they have thrown down a gauntlet demanding that governments stand up for justice , equality and dignity , " said @entity65 , @entity35 's secretary general			1
" they have shown that leaders who do n't meet these expectations will no longer be accepted			0
after an inauspicious start 2012 must become the year of action			0

@entity35 's annual report on global human rights lauds the courage of protesters
there has been a failure of leadership by the world 's politicians , says @entity35 chief @entity65
the @entity80 has failed to *intervene* to protect *ordinary* people , he says
activists around the world helped make 2011 a " truly tumultuous year , " @entity35 says
