members of @entity1 traveled to two @entity3 hospitals featured in a @entity5 report to visit the facilities and demand answers about why @entity9 veterans needlessly died there			1
the congressional delegations led by @entity13 chairman @entity12 , @entity14 , visited the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , and the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , after a @entity5 investigation that reported patients died as a result of delayed or denied care			1
six deaths have been confirmed so far , and sources tell @entity5 the number of veterans who are dead or dying of cancer because they had to wait too long for diagnosis or treatment could be more than 20			1
thousands of veterans were forced to wait months for simple screening tests like colonoscopies , and by the time they got diagnosed , it was too late			0
hospital delays are killing @entity9 's war veterans the wait lists for gastrointestinal appointments at the hospitals number in the thousands and go back as far as 2010			0
both hospitals say the wait list issues have been resolved , but according to the visiting members of @entity1 , the @entity47 still can not explain why or who was responsible for the poor treatment of veterans			1
rep. @entity52 , a @entity20 @entity53 whose district includes the @entity47 center , said @entity1 has " a duty to make sure that the veterans who serve get the best health care possible			1
and it is very obvious that for too long and for too many folks that has n't happened			0
" citing a lack of any disciplinary action and lack of ability to identify who at the @entity47 caused the backlogs to exist , @entity52 told reporters , " our goal here today is to try to get to the bottom of what happened and to prevent this from ever happening again			2
what 's important ( is for ) folks to understand this is just one step of a multistage affair to get to the bottom of what happened and to hold accountable those who were responsible			0
" the @entity13 has been looking into problems at @entity47 medical centers for the past year and says the @entity47 administration continues to stonewall and withhold information the congressmen believe is critical to understanding why the @entity47 appears to be run so poorly			1
the @entity47 has also refused @entity5 's repeated requests to interview secretary of veterans affairs @entity87 or any other @entity47 official on camera			1
@entity90 apologizes for deaths @entity12 said the practice at the @entity47 seems to be to hold no one accountable for errors , and instead transfer poorly performing executives and employees to other facilities instead of firing them			1
in an interview with @entity5 , @entity12 said he and his committee will continue to demand to know the names of those responsible and to demand disciplinary action			2
" that 's why we asked the question again today ... tell us exactly who was disciplined and how			0
" @entity12 said , " i do n't want to hear the excuse anymore that it was , ' well , it was multifaceted , there were many people involved			0
' ... well , if there were many people involved , then they all need to go			0
" @entity12 , who said he has been reluctant to make his investigations political , did say it is time the @entity115 starts paying attention to the deteriorating treatment of the nation 's veterans			0
he said he has been frustrated by a lack of cooperation from the @entity3 leadership , and that @entity87 has not paid enough attention to the medical problems at @entity47 medical centers			2
@entity12 also said it is time president @entity127 pay as much attention to what is happening at @entity47 medical centers as he does to what 's happening in @entity131 or @entity132 , a reference to the president 's recent vacation to his home state			2
" it 's time for him ( @entity87 ) to show some passion			0
and certainly it 's time to show some passion from the president			0
i mean , the fact that we 've had veterans who have died in the very facilities that are supposed to be taking care of them , and not by natural means , by means that could have been prevented , is egregious			1
" the congressman said his group has given the @entity47 30 days to respond to their requests for those answers .			2
