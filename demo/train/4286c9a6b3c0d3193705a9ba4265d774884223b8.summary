-- another top team official has been implicated in @entity4 cricket 's corruption scandal , which centers around illegal gambling on the country 's popular @entity7 tournament			2
after last month 's arrest of @entity12 -- formerly on the management staff of @entity10 team the @entity15 -- for his alleged involvement in betting in this year 's competition , an @entity10 team owner is now under police radar			1
@entity19 , a co-owner of @entity20 along with his @entity22 actress wife @entity21 , has been interrogated by @entity23 for his alleged role in spot - fixing -- a practice which involves prearranging certain incidents to occur during a match			1
after a 12 - hour interview thursday , police officials claimed @entity19 has admitted to betting and said they have confiscated his passport while the investigation continues			1
" during police interrogation , @entity19 admitted to betting on his own team , @entity20 , " delhi police commissioner @entity33 told @entity0			1
" he used to do so through his aide @entity36 , a bookie			2
according to our information he also lost a large amount of money in betting			2
" however , @entity33 said @entity19 can not be arrested as police do n't yet have " prosecutable evidence against him			1
" police have also learned about the possible involvement of @entity21 , but have yet to decide if she will be questioned			1
the couple has an 11.7 % stake in the @entity20 worth a reported $ 15 million			1
the @entity20 issued a joint statement from franchise chairman @entity50 and ceo @entity51 saying they are " cooperating with the authorities to ensure a thorough inquiry			1
" " mr. @entity19 is a minority shareholder , and he has no involvement in the running of the franchise , " they said			1
" we believe that mr. @entity19 is a law - abiding citizen and would not act contrary to law			1
if however , he is proven guilty , or has breached any regulations , he will be suspended , and he will also forfeit his shares			2
" @entity19 also released a statement , insisting : " i have done no wrong for which i need to have any regrets			1
" " i satisfactorily replied to the queries raised by the police and they accordingly allowed me to leave after my questioning , " he said			0
" however as the case develops , in due process , it may become necessary for the police to question me further			0
" i have not committed any wrong and am myself extremely anxious to know the whole truth			0
if an iota of wrongdoing is finally established against me i would unhesitatingly forfeit my share in the franchise			0
" after @entity19 's alleged confession to his involvement in @entity10 match - fixing , @entity4 cricket 's ruling body -- the @entity84 -- has convened an emergency working committee meeting of its board in @entity89 on june 10			1
while betting / gambling is a bailable offense under @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , @entity84 rules are rather stringent			2
according to @entity98 ( c ) of @entity100 agreement , any act of the owner that brings the @entity97 or @entity10 to disrepute will call in for annulment of agreement with the franchisee			2
when questioned whether @entity20 will be terminated from @entity10 , the @entity84 's interim chief @entity104 told reporters : " @entity19 's issue would be discussed in the working committee to be held on june 10 after we look into the details			1
if it demands any strict action we will look into it			0
" the arrest of @entity12 caused big concern for the @entity84 as he is the son - in - law of its president @entity115 , who is the @entity117 team principal			0
@entity115 has stood down from his @entity84 role while the investigation continues			0
meanwhile , a @entity121 court friday adjourned the bail plea of @entity4 cricketer @entity123 until monday			0
he had approached the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) court after a @entity89 court rejected his bail plea and extended his judicial custody until june 18			0
@entity123 , @entity128 and @entity129 were the first cricketers to be arrested in the @entity10 spot - fixing case			1
all three have played for @entity20			2
another controversy has clouded @entity4 cricket , with national team captain @entity135 being accused of having a conflict of interest for having stakes in the sports management company , @entity139			0
it also handles accounts for his fellow @entity143 internationals @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
the firm has denied that @entity135 has stakes in the company			0
when quizzed about the @entity84 's take on @entity135 's alleged conflict of interest issues , @entity104 said : " we will not cover up @entity135 's links with @entity139 , if any			0
but at this point when the team is busy with @entity157 ( in @entity158 )			0
we will not achieve anything by disturbing the atmosphere			0
