fresh off his @entity2 floor speech against arming @entity4 rebels , sen. @entity0 shifted gears thursday night to lambast the current state of police militarization in the @entity8 , especially when it comes to the war on drugs			1
the @entity13 @entity12 told a libertarian - leaning audience in @entity15 , @entity16 that police sometimes direct their focus on the wrong crimes			1
" you want your police to be aggressive , " he said			0
" but if someone 's got some pot , you want to break down the door at two in the morning with masks and gas and concussion grenades ? " @entity0 was speaking to the @entity28 , where moments before his speech he was on stage with his father , former rep. @entity31 , to deliver a scholarship award			1
it was a rare dual appearance by the two , as @entity0 , who 's laying the groundwork for a potential presidential bid , has attempted to differentiate himself from his father 's legacy as a vocal libertarian			1
( @entity0 , however , dutifully quoted his father at the end of his speech : " freedom is popular			1
" ) on militarization , @entity0 said the public may never really know what happened to @entity47 , the unarmed 18 - year - old shot dead by police in @entity50 , @entity51 last month , and he did n't weigh in on the still unfolding controversy			1
but he 's had much to say about the clashes between police and protesters that followed after the shooting			0
@entity0 made headlines last month with a commentary that called for the demilitarization of police			1
it was a bold stance at a time when many federal lawmakers were largely staying out of the @entity50 debate			0
he fired up the audience thursday night , ticking off examples of outsized arsenals in small communities , collections that he described as " crazy stuff			0
" " when you see something dumb like giving out 12,000 bayonets , just stop doing it , " he said			0
president @entity74 has ordered a review the federal programs that enable state and local law enforcements to purchase military equipment			0
some of that force , @entity0 said , has been used against marijuana users			1
recalling stories of people being injured during drug raids , @entity0 said the situation has " gotten out of control			2
" " i 'm ok with police using force , " he said , saying if his wife were taken hostage , he 'd want someone to save her			2
" but if somebody 's saying there 's some kid who 's got pot in the house , i think it 's a little crazy to have this war on drugs gone so far			0
" @entity0 has actively sought to reduce mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders , as well as restore voting rights for nonviolent felons who 've completed their sentences			2
the senator hits the road this weekend , this time to @entity107			0
he participates in a school choice roundtable discussion in @entity109 on friday , then speaks at the @entity107 @entity12 convention on saturday .			2
