-- with a father who is a toppled @entity3 leader and a mother accused of murder , the son , @entity1 , is now under scrutiny over reports of a lavish student lifestyle that have raised questions about where @entity11 's top cadres find their money			1
photographs of him bare - chested with his arms around female students at an @entity18 college party and urinating against a college fence have gone down badly in @entity11 , where his father , @entity20 , has been accused of corruption and stripped of his political post			1
@entity20 reacted furiously to questions about his 24 - year - old son 's lifestyle last month			1
" a few people have been pouring filth on @entity28 and me and my family , " @entity20 said at the time			2
" they even say that my son studies abroad and drives a red @entity31			2
sheer rubbish ! i feel really furious			0
sheer rubbish ! " despite the denials , rumors over his son 's allegedly flamboyant college lifestyle have added to the woes of the former @entity28 kingpin who promoted a revival of ' red culture ' and pushed efforts to bring back @entity45 slogans			1
while @entity20 family friends have defended @entity49 's college record and behavior , one family associate told @entity0 there was little sympathy in @entity11 for what many regard as the typically spoilt offspring of the @entity57 elite			1
" he ( @entity1 ) had tried to explain himself , saying the pictures showed him attending school parties which encouraged students to socialize and let their hair down , " the source said			2
" one picture showed him with an unbuttoned shirt and his arms around foreign students			0
he said it was quite normal there , but no one in @entity11 would buy that			2
here 90 % of people do not get the cultural differences			0
" the source added that the images had not played well in @entity11 , where @entity49 's antics have been grist for the country 's gossip - hungry microblogs			1
" many @entity11 admire and support @entity20 , but few like @entity1 , " the source said			1
what does @entity20 scandal mean for @entity11 ? a fellow student at the @entity82 -- where the cost for the average international student the school puts at $ 71,000 a year -- told @entity0 that @entity20 skirted attendance requirements at the college , making his first appearance at one seminar class on its final day when he was scheduled to make a presentation			1
" let me tell you how we 've been going about this all year , " the seminar 's instructor said to @entity20 , explaining the class 's protocols since he had not attended previous classes , the student recounted			1
" he more than anyone else that i know really pushed it to the boundaries , " the student said			2
" not attending seminars , not getting any feedback			0
" the student described @entity20 's presentation as " slapdash and put together at the last moment			1
" the seminar 's instructor declined to comment , citing student privacy policies			2
@entity20 was one of 21 students awarded a research grant from the school 's @entity114 for the current academic year			1
a school spokesman declined to say how many students competed for the grant which is awarded on " the quality of the proposal , the research focus , and travel requirements			0
" @entity82 spokesman @entity123 said he could not comment on specific students , citing privacy concerns			0
the family friend told @entity0 that reports about @entity20 's lackluster university record and rich - kid lifestyle were " one - sided and a bit unfair "			1
" he may have committed indiscretions in public , but he is not the spoiled brat who thinks of nothing but a good time , " the source said			0
" let 's remember that he had done some fund - raising for the victims of the @entity142 earthquake in 2008			0
the same year , he promoted the @entity143 in his school			0
" @entity145 : the paranoid style in @entity11 politics the family friend said @entity1 had been a smart and thoughtful child			1
" he learned calligraphy at a very young age and was a good writer in @entity11 and @entity153 , " the source said			2
" he published his writings in a paperback in 2005 when he was still in his late teens			0
" the family friend told @entity0 that far from receiving miserable grades , @entity1 's performance at @entity18 had been creditable , receiving a 2:1 grade			1
" it 's probably equivalent to an a minus which by @entity18 standards is pretty good ; and to the think he was handicapped by the problems of adjusting to a very different place and culture			0
he was in his early teens when he moved overseas to study , " the source said			0
while there has been speculation that @entity1 may seek asylum in the @entity175 in the light of his parents ' problems , the @entity175 agency that oversees asylum requests , the @entity181 , " can neither confirm nor deny that someone has filed a request , " according to spokesman @entity182			0
" as far as we know , there 's nothing to those reports ; he remains at school at @entity82 , " @entity183 , a @entity184 spokesman , told a press conference in @entity186 last week			0
@entity1 did not respond to emailed requests for comment .			0
