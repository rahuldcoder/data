-- @entity2 president @entity1 heads south of the border thursday to meet with @entity5 president @entity4 in the country 's capital			1
here are three key topics that are likely to be on the table , and a look at how the leaders and @entity5 have weighed in on those issues			2
@entity13 and economic ties the situation : the @entity2 is @entity5 's largest trading partner , and @entity5 is @entity17 's third - largest trade partner , after @entity18 and @entity19			1
imports and exports between the two countries totaled nearly $ 500 billion last year			0
officials on both sides of the border have said they want economic relations to be a focal point during @entity1 's visit			2
@entity1 's trip comes as @entity4 's government has said it 's on the verge of pursuing reforms in the country 's state - run oil company -- a politically divisive issue in @entity5 and something @entity2 and global investors are watching closely			1
@entity1 's take : " we spend so much time on security issues between the @entity2 and @entity5 that sometimes i think we forget this is a massive trading partner , responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border , " @entity1 told reporters on tuesday			1
" we want to see how we can deepen that , how we can improve that , and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time			0
" @entity4 's take : " we should reconsider greater integration of @entity17 to achieve a region that is more competitive and capable of creating more jobs , " @entity4 told @entity1 during a meeting at the @entity54 in november			1
public opinion : most @entity5 think the deep economic ties between the two countries are good for @entity5 , according to survey results released this week by the @entity62			1
but when the 1,000 people surveyed in march were asked about the influence the @entity2 currently has on economic conditions in @entity5 , views were mixed			1
one - third of @entity5 say the @entity2 is having a positive impact on national economic conditions in @entity5 , while 28 % think the @entity2 is having a negative impact			2
immigration the situation : the @entity2 and @entity5 are bound by a border which has made for a dysfunctional relationship over the years , especially when it comes to immigration			1
however , both governments have the issue high on their list of priorities			0
in the @entity2 , a bipartisan group of senators have proposed an immigration reform bill , with @entity2 - @entity5 border security at its foundation			1
there are more than 11 million @entity5 living in the @entity2 , including the 6 million estimated to be living there illegally as of 2010			2
but the migration rate from @entity5 fell to zero in 2012 , meaning the number of @entity5 coming to the @entity2 -- and those going the other way -- was virtually identical			2
@entity1 's take : " we 've got to have more effective border security ; although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last four or five years , " @entity1 said in a news conference this week			1
" we should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome , the bureaucracy is not as complicated , so we continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion			0
" @entity4 's take : " we fully support your proposal for this migration reform , " @entity4 told @entity1 in november			1
" more than demanding what you should do or should n't do , we do want to tell you that we want to contribute			0
we really want to participate with you			0
we want to contribute toward the accomplishment , so that of course we can participate in the betterment and the well - being of so many millions of people who live in your country			0
" public opinion : according to the @entity62 , @entity5 are divided on whether this is good or bad for their country ; 44 % say it 's good for @entity5 that many of its citizens live in the @entity2 , and an equal share say this is bad for @entity5			1
and , perhaps the most surprising find from the study said that 61 % of @entity5 would not move to the @entity2 even if they had the means to do so			2
however , 35 % say they would move to the @entity2 if they could , including 20 % who say they would emigrate without authorization			0
a little less than a third of the @entity5 questioned ( 30 % ) say they personally know someone who went to the @entity2 but returned to @entity5 because the person could n't find work , according to the @entity62			2
about a quarter ( 27 % ) know someone who has been deported or detained by the @entity2 government for immigration reasons in the last 12 months			0
security and the drug war the situation : the battle against drug cartels has played a dominant role in @entity2 - @entity5 relations in recent years			1
officials on both sides of the border have said that drugs traveling north from @entity5 to consumers in the @entity2 and weapons traveling south from the @entity2 to cartels in @entity5 are an increasingly deadly combination			2
high - profile cartel takedowns were a hallmark of former president @entity160 's tenure			0
@entity4 has vowed to take a different approach , focusing more on education problems and social inequality that he says fuel drug violence			0
the details of his policies are still coming into focus , and analysts say his government has deliberately tried to shift drug violence out of the spotlight			0
critics have expressed concerns that @entity4 's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year			0
on tuesday -- two days before @entity1 's arrival -- his government arrested the father - in - law of @entity186 " @entity181 , head of @entity5 's @entity182 and one of the country 's most - wanted drug lords			1
while both @entity1 and @entity4 have said they 're committed to working together on security issues , it 's unclear whether the @entity2 role will change as @entity5 's government shifts its strategy			1
@entity1 's take : the @entity2 president has repeatedly said the @entity2 will work to reduce demand for drugs and to stop the illegal flow of weapons to @entity5			1
but there 's one approach he says is n't on the table -- drug legalization			0
speaking at the @entity203 in @entity204 last year , @entity1 said it was reasonable to debate alternatives in the war on drugs , but insisted legalizing drugs is not a valid option in the @entity2			1
" i think it is entirely legitimate to have a conversation about whether the laws in place are doing more harm than good in certain places , " @entity1 said			0
" i personally , and my administration 's position is , that legalization is not the answer			0
" @entity4 's take : last year , @entity4 told @entity0 that creating more economic opportunities will be @entity5 's greatest weapon in the war on drugs			1
" that , i think , is going to be the best way my government can prevent organized crime , " he said			0
without jobs and social programs , he added , " millions of my countrymen have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity			0
" public opinion : nearly a third of @entity5 surveyed by @entity62 say @entity5 's government is losing ground against cartels , while 37 % say the government is making progress			1
@entity5 public opinion is mixed over the @entity2 role in the fight against drug cartels , according to the @entity62 survey			1
nearly three - quarters of @entity5 surveyed said they would welcome @entity2 assistance in training @entity5 police and military personnel			2
but support for the @entity2 providing money and weapons to @entity5 forces has lost some support in recent years , @entity62 said			2
in 2011 , 64 % of those surveyed said they backed such a strategy			0
this year , 55 % said they supported that approach			0
@entity0 's @entity255 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 and @entity4 have said they want to focus on the economy this week
security and immigration are also key issues between the @entity2 and @entity5
a recent survey indicates @entity5 public opinion on the issues is mixed
it 's unclear whether the @entity2 role will change as @entity5 's drug war strategy shifts
