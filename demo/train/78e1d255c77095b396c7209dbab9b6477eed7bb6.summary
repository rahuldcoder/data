-- the nominations for the @entity2 were presented thursday morning , and as always there were trends and surprises			1
here are a few things we learned : 1			2
make way for older women			1
it 's not for nothing that one of best jokes from @entity14 and @entity15 at the @entity16 referred to the lack of meaty roles for actresses of a certain age : " @entity21 ( is ) so brilliant in ' august : @entity22 , ' proving that there are still great parts in @entity25 for @entity26 over 60 , " said @entity14			2
and yes , @entity21 was nominated for an @entity2 ( for best actress ) as well			1
but also nominated were @entity28 , 79 , and perhaps more surprisingly , @entity29 , 84			2
@entity29 is a longtime character actress -- you may remember her as @entity31 in " @entity40 " or mrs. @entity32 in an episode of " @entity34 " -- who got a chance to shine as @entity38 's exasperated yet caring wife in " @entity39			1
" in fact , of the 10 actresses nominated for either best actress or best supporting actress , six are over 40 and two others -- @entity47 and @entity48 -- are in their late 30s			2
think you can pick the winners ? check out the @entity2 ballot 2			1
diversity , but no diversity			1
this year featured a number of notable movies starring or directed by people of color , including " @entity57 , " " @entity58 , " " 42 , " " @entity59 : @entity60 " and " 12 years a slave			0
" but of that group , only " 12 years " got any support from the @entity2 , with nine nominations			1
" @entity59 " picked up a nod for a @entity67 song ; " @entity58 " -- despite showcasing rising talents @entity69 and director @entity70 -- got nothing			0
and despite a $ 100 million box office -- and raves for performers @entity74 and @entity76 -- " @entity57 " also came up with zero			1
during the @entity16 show , there was a @entity80 hashtag protesting the lack of diversity : # notbuyingit			2
you 'll probably see it again on @entity2 night			1
2014 awards season : does diversity matter more than wins ? 3			2
where 's @entity90 ? what about @entity76 ? @entity90 is one of the most beloved film stars in @entity25			1
he 's a successful producer and two - time oscar winner			0
after a sluggish few years , marked by " @entity100 , " " @entity99 " and " @entity101 , " he was back in the good graces at the box office and with critics , thanks to " @entity98 " and " @entity102			0
" the result ? no @entity2 nominations			1
maybe he split the vote ; maybe voters just were n't that impressed			0
( they certainly were n't by " mr. @entity108			0
" ) as for @entity76 -- also a successful producer and personality -- the theory is that " the @entity113 's " summer release hurt its chances			1
but it was still a surprise that her name was n't listed for either the @entity2 or the @entity16			1
better luck at the @entity119 , @entity76			1
there are no sure things			0
the handicappers were wrong about a lot			0
take a gander : snubbed : @entity125 , " @entity126			0
" an almost wordless solo performance goes for naught at the @entity2			1
" lost , " indeed			0
snubbed : the @entity129 , " @entity130			0
" despite their offbeat production , @entity131 and @entity132 have become @entity2 favorites -- even if it 's just a scriptwriting nod			1
@entity130 will have to keep walking the streets ( probably with a waterlogged shoe )			0
snubbed : @entity138 , " @entity102			0
" so much for " banks " despite its @entity141 pedigree			0
snubbed : @entity142 , " @entity143			0
" the academy thought " enough " was apparently too much , since neither @entity145 nor @entity147 's script were picked , either			0
surprise ! : @entity48 , " @entity149			0
" the academy loves @entity152 screenplays ( he got nominated , too ) , and @entity48 was n't overlooked			2
surprise ! : " @entity154			0
" a small , character - driven movie about a woman searching for her son ? best picture , best actress ( @entity28 ) and best adapted screenplay nominations are the prizes			2
special coverage : all things awards season 5			0
" perhaps " @entity168 , " " 12 years " and " gravity " will duke it out for best picture			0
but remember " no sure things , " because when it came to audience response at the nominations , " @entity165 " was the clear winner , greeted with cheers for every nomination			2
it has an @entity2 - friendly subject -- a heroic battle against @entity180 -- and strong performances by @entity182 and @entity183			1
it received a surprising six nominations			2
the @entity2 are march 2			1
confessions of an @entity2 freak			1
