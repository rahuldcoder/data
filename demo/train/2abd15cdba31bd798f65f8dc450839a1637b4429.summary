@entity0 says the transfer ban placed on the club is " disproportionate " and " excessive			1
" the @entity5 club hit back on tuesday after losing its appeal to the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) following the decision to ban it from being able to sign new players over the next 12 months			1
@entity7 stated that @entity0 was guilty of breaching @entity11 rules on signing minors and confirmed that the club would be unable to add to its squad during the next two transfer windows			1
" @entity16 found in particular that @entity0 had breached the rules regarding the protection of minors and the registration of minors attending football academies			2
accordingly , the @entity11 decision is confirmed in full and the sanction remains in force , " a @entity7 statement read			2
@entity0 , which was also fined $ 455,000 , said it " totally disagrees " with the verdict and will now study the different legal options at its disposal including the @entity29			0
in a statement , @entity0 said that it " understands and supports the policy on the protection of minors and the concern for the protection of their development and education			0
" it added : " this is confirmed by how the club has acted throughout its history , setting an example around the world for the way its young footballers are schooled and educated , and the work that is done on their development			0
@entity0 's youth structure has enabled hundreds of young players to achieve their dreams and receive a decent upbringing			1
" the errors that the club might have committed , and which have been recognized and argued before the corresponding authorities are , in all cases , of an administrative nature and to a large extent have been caused by the existing conflict between the @entity11 regulations and @entity62 legislation , along with the club 's conviction that it was acting correctly			2
" therefore , @entity0 considers the sanction to be completely disproportionate as it supposes an excessive punishment for the club , when considering its trajectory and the circumstances of this specific case			0
" @entity0 has one of the most famous and successful academies in the game with young players from all over the world learning their trade with the club			2
" @entity82 " as it is known , has helped produced talents such as @entity79 , who arrived from @entity80 at the age of 11			0
the ruling comes after an investigation found the club had broken regulations regarding the transfer of young players from outside @entity62			2
@entity11 's investigation focused on several players aged under 18 who were registered and played for the club between 2009 and 2013			1
under @entity11 laws , clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the @entity97 , is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border			1
@entity0 was originally handed a 14 - month ban in april but launched an appeal to @entity11 , world football 's governing body which was rejected in august			1
but the decision to appeal to @entity7 meant @entity0 was allowed to complete a number of signings in the intervening period			1
@entity0 splashed out a reported $ 128.5 million to sign @entity112 international @entity111 from @entity113			0
@entity115 defender @entity114 was brought in from @entity116 for $ 30m while @entity118 defender @entity117 and @entity120 goalkeeper @entity119 also arrived at @entity121			0
@entity123 midfielder @entity122 from @entity124 joined @entity0 for a fee of $ 23.9m with the club also paying $ 3m to @entity127 for @entity128			0
@entity130 's side currently sits second in @entity131 , one point behind fierce rival @entity133 .			0
