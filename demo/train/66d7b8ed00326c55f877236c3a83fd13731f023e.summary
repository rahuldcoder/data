@entity0 , who was walking with @entity1 before officer @entity2 fatally shot @entity1 in august , told remarkably similar stories in an interview with county and federal authorities in august and in testimony to the grand jury in september			1
the first interview , conducted by an @entity12 agent and a @entity13 crimes - against - persons detective , was part of a friday document dump by the prosecutor who presented the case to the grand jury			1
prosecuting attorney @entity20 initially released grand jury documents in late november , but did n't include @entity0 's august interview			1
that was a mistake , he said in a letter accompanying friday 's documents			0
" it was brought to my attention that i omitted the @entity12 interview of @entity0			2
upon review of the files , i discovered that i had inadvertently omitted a number of witness interviews and a few other documents which had been presented to the grand jury , " he wrote			0
" it should be noted that the sworn testimony of these witnesses , including @entity0 , was released on november 24 , 2014			1
" one challenge for @entity40 grand jury : some witnesses ' credibility the prosecutor apologized for any confusion and said he now believes he has released all evidence presented to the grand jury that declined to indict @entity2 last month			2
if he finds anything else he unintentionally omitted , he will release it promptly after it 's discovered , he said			0
that does n't include autopsy photographs , photographs of @entity1 at the scene and any material that might identify any of the witnesses			2
according to an examination of the transcripts of @entity0 's two accounts -- delivered 28 days apart -- @entity1 's friend had roughly the same recollection of what he saw on the afternoon of august 9			1
he was consistent on many of the broader points : the two went to the store to buy cigarillos so they could smoke marijuana			0
at the store , @entity1 nonchalantly stole several cigarillos and left the store			0
@entity0 was worried about the police after the theft , but @entity1 did n't seem fazed , even when @entity2 pulled up to them several blocks from the store and told them to " get the f * * * on the sidewalk			1
" @entity2 pulled off but quickly reversed and tried to exit his car , but the car door bounced off of @entity1 and @entity0			1
@entity2 grabbed @entity1 by the neck , and the two engaged in a sort of tug of war before @entity2 twice threatened to shoot and fired , hitting @entity1 , before finishing the second threat			2
@entity1 and @entity0 took off running and @entity2 did n't immediately pursue them			1
@entity0 hid by a vehicle as @entity2 exited his vehicle , pursued @entity1 and fired once , prompting @entity1 to turn around with his hands up in surrender			2
@entity2 then fired a volley of shots			0
the discrepancies in @entity0 's stories were minor and perhaps a product of the questions he was asked			1
for instance , in one account , he said he and @entity95 had spoken to construction workers about getting high on marijuana			0
in another account , he said a construction worker told him and @entity95 that he smoked only " wax , " a form of hashish			0
another example is @entity0 's assertion to the grand jury that before he and @entity1 went to the store for cigarillos , he originally intended to purchase them from someone living in the apartment complex			1
there is no mention of this in the account @entity0 provided the @entity12 and county detective			1
his recollection of what @entity1 said to @entity2 about being unarmed differs slightly as well			2
@entity0 at first said @entity1 told @entity2 he was n't armed as they tussled at the car and again before the fatal volley of shots			1
in his account to the grand jury , he said @entity1 said it only after being shot			0
@entity0 may have changed one aspect of his story after his interviewers pointed out he was relaying an assumption rather than an actual eyewitness account			0
while speaking to the @entity12 and county , @entity0 said @entity2 definitely shot @entity1 in the back as he fled			1
" as he 's runnin ' passed the third car , the officer behind him pointed his weapon with his weapon drawn and he fired a second that did strike my friend @entity137 in his back ' cause that 's when he stopped runnin ' , " he said			0
later in the interview , he reiterated this claim , saying , " that 's why i know he was hit because he stopped runnin '			0
" and on a third occasion , he told the interviewers , " it definitely struck him in his back			0
i do n't know verbatim where at			0
" when the interviewers press @entity0 -- did he actually see @entity2 shoot @entity1 in the back , or was he just speculating based on what he saw ? -- @entity0 conceded , " ok , so for the purposes , no. i did not see a hole in his shirt rip while i 'm in shock			2
" about a month later , before the grand jury , @entity0 made it clear he saw @entity2 fire at @entity1 as he fled , but he was n't sure if the bullet hit his friend			1
" the second time he shot , i did n't know if it hit him or not , but he kind of jerked and that 's when he stopped running			0
he just kind of stopped and turned around at the officer , " @entity0 said			0
portions of @entity0 's account are not supported by other witness statements , and there are myriad inconsistencies in the witness testimony			1
@entity2 's statement also does n't jibe with @entity0 's			1
among the discrepancies : @entity2 and some witnesses said @entity1 attacked the officer , prompting @entity2 to fire twice from his police vehicle ; @entity2 and some witnesses said @entity1 fled at first but then charged him ; and witnesses varied on whether @entity1 had his hands up when the fatal shots were fired .			2

in interviews 28 days apart , @entity0 told similar stories about @entity1 's death
@entity0 's interview with @entity12 , county detective released friday in latest document dump in case
many inconsistencies minor , possibly the result of different questions
many witness accounts do n't jibe , including those of @entity0 and officer @entity2
