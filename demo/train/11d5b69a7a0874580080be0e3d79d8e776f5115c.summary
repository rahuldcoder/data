@entity1 a pair of @entity1 police officers shot and wounded while responding to an armed robbery in the @entity6 were going off - duty and probably not wearing their bulletproof vests , police officials said tuesday			1
in fact , @entity9 , @entity10 and three other officers were changing clothes at the end of a dangerous anti-crime detail when they ran out of a @entity6 station house to search for two robbery suspects , officials said			1
the suspects were arrested tuesday			2
" chances are they were n't wearing their vests , " chief of department @entity20 told reporters			0
" they were going home			0
they jumped into a car and they ended up getting into this fierce firefight			0
" the alleged shooter was identified as @entity32 , a 24 - year - old boxer who was charged with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer and was said to have posted anti-police and anti-government statements on social media , police said			2
his alleged accomplice , @entity38 , 28 , was arrested on robbery charges			1
the wounded officers spent tuesday at @entity41 in the @entity6			1
one of them , @entity9 , who is 30 and has eight years on the job , was in stable condition following surgery after being shot in the arm and lower back , according to police			1
the other , @entity10 , who is 38 and has nine years as an officer , is in stable condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and arm			1
" last night a team of our officers displayed extraordinary bravery , going above and beyond the call to protect their fellow @entity1 , " mayor @entity54 , who has found himself at odds with some in his police force in recent weeks , said in a statement tuesday			1
" we thank these officers for their commitment to serving our city , including answering the call after their shift had ended			2
... this incident was yet another reminder of how profoundly important the work of our police officers is , as well as the seriousness of the dangers they face every day in the line of duty			1
" @entity78 also thanked @entity1 who provided more than two dozen tips that helped identify the gunman			0
police said 10 of the tipsters identified @entity32 by name			2
monday night , authorities located the white @entity86 that two suspects carjacked a block from the shooting , as well as a .44 - caliber revolver , but no one was inside the vehicle			0
before @entity32 was arrested , police offered a $ 12,000 reward for information leading to a bearded man pictured in a surveillance video from inside a take - out @entity99 restaurant moments before the shooting			1
police said he was the man who shot at the officers			1
@entity32 entered the restaurant and bought a bottle of iced tea before coming out firing at the officers who stopped his alleged accomplice outside , police said			1
' extraordinarily brave ' the call about an armed robbery at a @entity6 grocery store came in around 10:30 p.m. monday , as five plainclothes officers were coming off their shift			1
rather than going home , the police went to look for the criminals , something @entity54 described as " extraordinarily brave and ... part of their commitment			2
" the officers exchanged gunfire with @entity32 , police said , but the suspects got away , fleeing on foot for one block and then carjacking the @entity86			1
at tense time for police in city sometime after the shooting , @entity38 checked himself into a @entity131 hospital with a gunshot wound to the back , officials said			2
the man who drove him to the hospital was also taken into custody			0
@entity38 , who has been arrested multiple times for robbery and was on parole , gave an account of how he was shot that did n't add up , police said			1
" he told a story that did n't seem factual , to be honest with you , " @entity144 , chief of detectives , told reporters			0
" he was not credible			0
... so , quickly the story did n't add up and then we saw his background , that he was a @entity6 guy and we started breaking the case			0
" the incident happened just south of @entity154 , an area hardly unfamiliar to violent crime			0
@entity157 , who patrolled the area when he was a police officer , called it " a rough neighborhood in the ' 90s , and it still is today ... ( it had and has ) armed bad guys with the propensity to shoot someone			2
" the shootings have gotten heightened attention given when they happened -- at a time of large - scale anti-police protests after a grand jury decided not to indict a white @entity1 police officer in the death of @entity172 , an @entity173 man			2
even if it 's too early to tie it to this incident , experts in the law enforcement community have expressed concerns that such sentiment -- views supported in some respects , according to some police , by @entity54 -- will encourage violence against police			0
that 's what happened , they say , when @entity189 fatally ambushed @entity191 officers @entity192 and @entity193 last month as they sat in their patrol car			1
" when the rhetoric turns anti-police , the police are concerned that people on the street , it 's going to increase the already existent lack of respect in certain segments of the society -- including armed robbers ... and other violent criminals , " said @entity2 law enforcement analyst @entity195 , a former @entity196 assistant director			2
@entity78 has become a focal point for supporters of law enforcement , with some police even turning their backs on him at @entity192 ' and @entity193 's funerals because of their perception that he has been overly supportive of protesters and critical of police			0
" the relationship is toxic ( and ) almost irretrievable in some respects , " @entity2 political commentator @entity215 said of the mayor - police dynamic			0
" this is not a good atmosphere			0
" on tuesday , @entity221 , the president of the @entity222 , who has accused @entity54 of having " blood on his hands " after the two officers were killed in december , said in a statement : " @entity1 police officers , who could have closed their lockers and gone home after their shift ended , chose to respond to a robbery in progress and , sadly , were shot in the process			1
our members are out there doing their jobs and putting themselves in danger to keep this city safe just as they always do			0
