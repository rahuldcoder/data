editor 's note : @entity4 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose forthcoming book is " @entity6 : a @entity7			1
" @entity2 says kin of @entity10 victims do n't have the luxury of moving on after the 10th anniversary is marked			1
( @entity4 ) -- the weddings that will never be held			1
the birthdays when there will be no one to embrace			2
the first jobs that will never be greeted with a parent 's proud smile of congratulations			2
those are the things -- the sacred things , perhaps the sole things -- that we should pause to think about monday			2
because while the rest of the world considers anew the meaning of what happened 10 years ago at the school in @entity28 , @entity29 , the people who matter -- the only people who truly can fathom the meaning -- are the people with the wounds in their hearts that will never quite heal : the mothers and fathers of the children who were murdered			1
the brothers and sisters who were left with the empty and soundless spaces in their homes and in their lives			2
for the rest of us , it 's all guesswork , and the anniversary provides a circumscribed time to think about it somberly			2
but by tomorrow we will have moved on to other concerns , while the mothers and fathers , the sisters and brothers -- the grandfathers and the grandmothers -- will return to that which they can never wish away : the weddings that wo n't ever come			2
the birthdays when there is only silence			2
is it possible to break that april day from 10 years ago into its incremental elements , as if by doing so we will be able to find a possible future remedy ? if we think enough about the saturation of our society with violent images , from the movies we watch to the video games our children play to the stories on the evening news -- is that what can explain @entity10 ? if we dissect the live television coverage of that day when millions stared for hours on end -- was it those unblinking pictures that made the scenes still so hard to shake ? is there a resolution to be discovered in debates about the guns that were used , the need for security checkpoints ? those are all just details , not answers			1
those are merely facts to be noted			2
what is worth paying attention to is that we , as a people , have developed , without really wanting to or knowing we were doing it , the thousand - yard stare that you see in the eyes of certain homicide detectives who have been doing their jobs for a very long time			1
it is a look of utter numbness -- a look that is the opposite of cynical , a look of sorrowful surrender			0
it is a look that says , of the bearer of those eyes : my eyes are dead because i know that what they have witnessed is only prologue			1
my eyes show nothing because they must be prepared for what they know they will be seeing again			1
to encounter those eyes -- to see the thousand - yard stare -- in a police officer is one thing			1
but to see it in a country			0
... yet that is what the many years of nonstop killings have done to us			0
columbine -- that word , that label -- is the way we sum up this kind of thing , but labels like that are at core our way of conceding our inability to process the despair			0
there was murderous madness that came before @entity10 , and murderous madness that came after			1
we tell ourselves on each new occasion that what has happened is shocking , but the word has become all but meaningless			0
the only genuinely shocking thing would be if the cruelty and the killings were to somehow suddenly cease			0
we can blame all of this on our modern times veering out of control , if we wish , but it really speaks of something more elemental and dark , of factors beyond our earthly understanding			0
the most deadly attack upon sons and daughters at a school did not occur at @entity10 10 years ago , or at @entity154 two years ago			1
on may 18 , 1927 , in @entity155 , @entity156 , 44 people , most of them elementary school pupils in their classrooms , were slaughtered by a man who set off a series of bombs and then killed himself to raise his toll to 45			1
he was a member of the local school board ; he was angry about a tax assessment			0
the madness and the heartache do not belong to a certain era or to a certain place on the map			0
nor do the heartache , and the unending echoes of days like those , belong to the rest of us , however honorable we may wish our intentions to be			0
we -- the rest of us -- will move on by tomorrow			0
the anniversary will be over			0
leaving the mothers and fathers , the sisters and brothers			0
and the lesson ? the lesson we never seem to learn ? it can be found in words that have been quoted and paraphrased many times , in many languages , over many centuries			0
but still we ca n't seem to get it right			0
what is it that we seek ? something that sounds so simple , something like a prayer : to tame the savageness of man , and make gentle the life of the world			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity10 victims live with the pain every day
@entity2 : most @entity204 see such violence with numb eyes and can look elsewhere
the pain of these *incidents* *predated* the horror of @entity10 , @entity2 says
he says people *eternally* have sought to tame human savagery
