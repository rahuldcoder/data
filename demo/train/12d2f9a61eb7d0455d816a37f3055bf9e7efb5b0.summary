-- @entity3 - colored oil washed ashore on barrier islands off @entity5 and @entity6 on tuesday , while more patches of crude offshore appeared to be moving toward those states ' coasts , authorities reported			1
researchers scrambled to clean up tar balls and puddles of oil from the beaches of @entity5 's @entity16 , while a strip of oil about two miles long and three feet wide stretched along @entity19 , about five miles away off @entity6 , gov. @entity21 's office reported			1
it marked the first time oil has hit @entity6 's shores since the largest oil spill in @entity27 history erupted in late april			1
and while tar balls associated with the @entity31 spill had hit @entity16 , about 35 miles south of @entity32 , in early may , residents said that tuesday was the first time they had seen oil hitting the beach			2
only part of the island 's beaches have been lined with protective booms , with much of those barriers lined up near a protected wildlife area on the west end of the island			1
@entity44 , a @entity45 researcher on @entity16 , said the oil is believed to be from @entity47 's ruptured well off @entity48			0
she predicted much more would be hitting the coast in coming days -- but vacationers remained on the beach , and some were still swimming in the blue - green waters as the cleanup continued			0
and researchers from the @entity55 spotted large patches of the reddish - brown " weathered " oil during a water - sampling expedition offshore tuesday , said @entity59 , the laboratory 's associate director			1
@entity59 said the oil spots on the water ranged from the size of a half - dollar coin to 30 to 40 feet			0
a half - dozen boats could be seen skimming oil off the surface about 13 miles south of the island , he said			2
however , " they were covering a very , very small spot in the ocean compared to what we saw , " he said			0
the @entity74 had warned earlier this week that the spreading slick from an undersea @entity47 oil well was heading toward the @entity5 and @entity6 coasts			2
@entity59 said tides in the area are running east and winds have been out of the southwest , driving the oil toward beach towns on the eastern side of @entity85			0
@entity87 adm. @entity86 said earlier tuesday that authorities were investigating reports that the outer sheen of oil was reaching coastal waters off @entity6 and @entity5 , but said those reports had not been confirmed			1
" we 've dispatched survey teams to see what the impact is out there , and to the extent that is required , we 'll move resources that direction , " @entity86 , the federal government 's national incident commander , told reporters in @entity96 , @entity48			0
@entity0 's @entity105 and @entity106 contributed to this report .			0
