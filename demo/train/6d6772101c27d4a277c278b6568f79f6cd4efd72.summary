-- @entity1 is not a man to play @entity4 roulette with his career -- but time is running out			1
now 30 , he is entering the twilight zone of his time on court with the opportunities to provide for his retirement decreasing every day			1
the problem for the @entity13 is that the cost of competing at the highest level is soaring , meaning he must collect $ 200,000 in prize money each year just to break even			1
it 's not a problem for those in the top 10 -- but with rising expenses and endless airfares to pay for , those unable to win the grand slams or attract big name sponsors are facing a conundrum			1
for @entity1 the choice is clear -- shell out the cash now and hope the investment pays off			1
splashing the cash " i do n't have a long career left so i decided to spend whatever is necessary , " he told @entity0 's @entity33			1
" i want to get the best results i want to get out of the game knowing i gave it my best and that i did n't try to save up on anything			2
" roughly , i probably spend $ 100,000 on traveling , plus or minus $ 10,000 , it 's kind of hard to say because i think the expenses are going up , the tickets are getting more expensive			2
" i think also a lot of the times you have to fly business , not out of luxury , but it 's the only time you can get some rest and sleep			0
" if you are sitting in a little shrimp position , it 's going to take you two days to recover , especially the older you get			0
" i did n't believe that but i am starting to believe it			0
it takes me two or three days to get out of the travel			0
" @entity1 travels with his coach and physio , paying for their flights , accommodation and wages			1
he reckons he spends over $ 200,000 on his staff each year			1
the last of his seven singles titles came in 2011 and while he has bounced around the circuit picking up prize money , the opportunity to earn the big bucks continues to elude him			2
according to @entity71 , the 10 - highest paid tennis players in the world earned a combined $ 60 million in prize money between june 2012 and june 2013			1
@entity73 , the 17 - time grand slam winner , is estimated to have earned $ 71.5 million in that time from sponsors , endorsements and exhibition matches , not to mention the $ 6.5 million in prize money			1
in the women 's game , @entity79 leads the way , earning $ 29 million a year , making her the highest paid female athlete in the world			1
it is a world away from where @entity1 lives -- a man who has earned just shy of $ 587,000 in prize money so far this year			1
" you play against very good players , " he said			0
" it 's hard for people to grasp but you are playing against someone top 100 in his profession in the world which is pretty impressive			2
" if you play a top 100 golfer in the world , doctor or basketball player , all these guys are making ridiculous money			2
" but again it 's hard to compare the sports but the expenses are a lot higher than even in basketball because we do n't have a team who are paying our expenses			0
" @entity1 does not travel with a hitting partner as @entity114 does , nor does the @entity4 have the backing of lucrative sponsors			1
and while he accepts that he has not done badly , earning nearly $ 5 million during his career , he says the costs of competing on the circuit are constantly spiraling			2
" there are certain expenses you ca n't escape such as airline tickets and so forth but then you have coaches , if you want to compete well , if you want to make it in to the top 50 there 's no way you can do that without a coach , " he said			0
@entity73 has done it for some time but he 's still traveling with a physio , the guy who strings his racquets and those are all expenses you pay yourself			0
" you pay a salary to your coach , then you pay his and your travel expenses as well as food			0
i think to travel with a coach you are probably going to hit $ 200,000 a year in expenses			2
" @entity1 was just 12 when he left his native @entity4 to try his luck in the @entity146 after being introduced to a tennis coach through his father			1
following a one - month trial , it was decided that this prodigious young talent had a real talent -- and after that there was no looking back			2
" the coach felt like i was someone , " remembered @entity1			1
" he saw some potential in me and i decided that i had a one - way ticket to the @entity146 and my dad left me after a month			2
" while he has never managed to prosper at the grand slam tournaments , @entity159 has enjoyed his time in the sun. cast your mind back to @entity165 and it was the @entity4 who played the pantomime villain on @entity168 by defeating @entity170 favorite @entity169			1
amidst the searing pressure cooker heat of a tense five set match , it was @entity1 who prevailed 8 - 6 in the fifth to silence the raucous home crowd			1
a year later , he played an integral role in @entity4 's @entity177 victory over the @entity146 by defeating @entity178 in dramatic fashion , 17 - 15 in the fifth			1
" after that long fifth set , my dad said ' i 'm really sorry i put you in to tennis '			0
" i felt he actually meant it -- the match lasted nearly five hours			0
i think he was pretty exhausted			0
" exhaustion is a feeling @entity1 knows all too well			1
he is a keen sleeper , taking advantage of every possible second in his hotel bedroom to catch forty winks			0
in his opinion , it 's getting tougher at the top with the likes of @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity114 pulling away from the old master , @entity73			0
not since 2006 has @entity1 made it into the top 20 and the prospect of him repeating that feat looks unlikely given the amount of competition			1
" i feel like it 's getting closer and closer in terms of the top 100 guys , " he added			0
" you see a lot of these results where @entity73 and @entity198 lost early in tournaments			0
" i ca n't remember a time when @entity214 lost that early , or @entity215 , he did n't lose that early ever in his lifetime			0
i think it 's getting a little bit tougher			0
" obviously there 's a lot more money involved and the players in order to compete we have to be a lot more professional and so i think the level of professionalism is getting a little bit higher			0
" it 's hard for me to say what it was like 20 , 30 years ago , but i feel like when i first started there were a couple of matches where you looked at the draw and said ' ok this is a fairly sure win '			2
" but i feel like there 's almost no easy matches unless you know the guy 's injured or he 's coming from a different continent			0

@entity1 is ranked 40th in the world
@entity4 reached a career high of 20th in 2006
the 30 - year - old has won seven career titles but no grand slams
has also enjoyed a *successful* doubles career with six titles
