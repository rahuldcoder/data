-- if you 're going to name your kid after a wild animal , at least have a good reason			2
@entity5 , who welcomed son @entity6 with husband @entity8 last december , has assured " @entity10 's " @entity9 that yes , there 's a purpose for the kid 's unique signature			1
@entity6 is the 38 - year - old star 's third child -- she had daughter @entity17 , 13 , and son @entity18 , 10 , with prior husbands @entity19 and @entity21 , respectively -- and this time around she had baby names on the brain			1
" when i was pregnant with @entity17 and i was pregnant with @entity18 , i did n't name them before they came out because i always felt like i just have to see them and see who they 're going to be , " @entity5 said			1
" but of course this time around , there 's @entity17 and @entity18 and the whole pregnancy 's about what are we going to call the baby			1
... they were very much included , and we settled on @entity37 quite early on			0
" the reason she loved the name is because a friend of hers was nicknamed @entity37 , " and i just had always really loved it , " the " divergent " actress said			2
" he was very much a bear , he was everybody 's shoulder to cry on , he was a big bear hug			0
he was just this great figure in my life			0
" and to pick @entity37 's middle name , she and her husband @entity49 wanted something that represented their bond			0
" @entity37 's second name is blaze because my husband and i met in a house fire basically , " the actress continued , referring to the fire that consumed billionaire @entity58 's @entity57 home while she was staying there in 2011			0
" the house burnt down and we survived , but we wanted something of the fire , and so @entity6 was the name that we came up with			0
" @entity6 may be uncommon , but @entity5 did n't want to be creative with the infant 's last name			1
while her husband enjoys the last name @entity8 , an eccentric moniker he adopted before he met and married the actress , it 's pretty clear she does n't like it			2
when @entity9 asked why @entity5 's youngest son is n't taking his father 's last name , she paused before responding with a laugh , " why do you think , @entity10 ? " instead , he 'll be known as @entity80 .			1

@entity5 chose a *surprising* name for her third child
she *explains* on " @entity10 " that there 's a reason for the unique *combination*
the baby will not have his father 's eccentric last name , however
