" those three ominous words -- especially for an organization in the highly competitive news business -- were seen on computer screens nationwide as customers tried to access the @entity7 website this week			1
the newspaper 's site was crippled for more than 20 hours			2
a notorious group of hackers called the @entity12 claimed responsibility			1
beyond the crippling of one high - profile newspaper website , the incident has people asking broader questions about @entity20 cybersecurity : how vulnerable are @entity20 websites to attack ? who are our potential cyberenemies ? is there more to come ? the answers are n't comforting : computer and homeland security experts now warn of a broader cyberwar if the @entity20 launches military strikes on @entity31			1
@entity32 , director of the @entity33 at @entity34 , believes the @entity12 will likely strike again -- and might have help			1
" if they did work with some of their allies -- with @entity39 , if they were to get some support from @entity42 and @entity43 -- then the game changes quickly , " @entity32 said			1
" it escalates in terms of capability			0
" the @entity12 might not be the most sophisticated gathering of hackers at the moment , but experts say its shown the ability to wreak plenty of havoc -- primarily with media outlets so far			1
such attacks can be costly			0
in april , the group hacked the @entity60 feed operated by the @entity61 and put out a fake message saying " breaking : two explosions in the @entity65 and @entity66 is injured			0
" that caused a brief panic , and stock markets plummeted temporarily			0
@entity70 , a researcher at the @entity71 ' @entity72 at the @entity73 , predicts these hackers will look for more chances to exploit weaknesses in @entity20 's cybergrids			1
" it 's not what they want to do or could do ; it 's what are the available vulnerabilities out there , " said @entity70			0
the @entity12 has already ably demonstrated those soft spots -- and that 's by a possibly ragtag group that 's not considered particularly sophisticated in the hacking world			1
" the @entity12 is a murky , underground group that has made a name for itself by plastering pro-regime propaganda across some of the @entity95 's most trafficked sites , " a @entity20 official told @entity89			1
" it 's clearly a nuisance , but its tactics are n't all that sophisticated			0
and while the regime probably welcomes its efforts , @entity99 is n't necessarily calling the shots			0
" " it appears to be a loose collective of a few individuals , " said former hacker @entity103 of the group , which supports @entity31 president @entity105			1
@entity103 , who 's now chief technology officer for the cybersecurity firm @entity109 , also says these hackers might not have been in the game for that long			2
" there 's been some information put out on the internet that ( some ) could be even as young as 19 - year - olds			0
" whatever the age of its members , the @entity12 has recently escalated its method of attacks			1
previously , cybersecurity experts say , it would only go after the direct managers of the websites it was hacking , using phishing e-mail to attempt to trick those operators into revealing their login credentials			2
but earlier this month , the group targeted a search engine that directs traffic to @entity89 and the @entity130			2
security for the @entity89 and @entity133 sites were not compromised			2
in the case of the @entity7 attack , the @entity31 group went after the larger connection chain			1
it 's called the @entity139			0
it connects you , when you type in " @entity89 " or any other website , to the specific computer addresses where that content can be found			0
experts say the hackers went after the managers of those connections ; in this case , a firm that works with a company called @entity153 it			0
the hackers tricked employees of that firm into giving up their passwords			0
once they did that , many people trying to access the @entity7 website were steered instead to servers controlled by the @entity12			1
that makes more than the @entity7 vulnerable			2
" you could basically have your computer attacked , " said @entity103			0
" by hitting this unknown malicious website , if you had out - of - date software or out - of - date anti-virus , your computer could actually be compromised			0

the @entity12 crippled the @entity7 ' website earlier this week
experts now warn of a broader cyberwar if the @entity20 launches military strikes on @entity31
homeland security expert : " game changes quickly " if @entity42 or @entity43 get involved
