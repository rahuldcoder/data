-- as a @entity2 , i did n't think anything could shock me when it comes to @entity6 bigotry			0
but i have to give it up for @entity9 state rep. @entity8 , a @entity10 , who has set a record for the vilest @entity6 comments yet			1
what makes @entity8 's comments so alarming is that they were n't directed against @entity17 terrorists such as @entity18 , but rather against @entity2 , people like my family , friends and me			1
a few weeks ago , @entity8 posted on @entity22 using his account " state representative @entity8 " that @entity24 should be " wary " of @entity2 : " the @entity25 clearly states that non-muslims should be killed			1
@entity27 is the ethnicity , not @entity17 or @entity17			0
be wary of the individuals who claim to be ' @entity2			0
' be especially wary if you are @entity24			0
" despite calls for @entity8 to apologize for inciting hate against @entity2 , he instead escalated his campaign of bigotry			1
on monday , @entity8 held a public forum with more than 100 constituents in a @entity39 ' steakhouse in @entity40 , @entity9			1
there , @entity8 provided his supporters with something other than steak -- a big helping of hate			1
according to the @entity46 , @entity8 told the audience that @entity48 are a " cancer that must be cut out of the @entity51 society			1
" he added that the goal of @entity48 is " the destruction of @entity55 civilization from within			2
" but here 's where @entity8 's comments truly become bone chilling			2
@entity8 , a military veteran , issued what some could interpret as a call to arms : " i 'm not advocating violence against anyone ... but i am not going to stand back and allow them to let @entity17 take over this nation			2
" so how did the audience at the @entity39 ' respond to @entity8 's speech ? with a standing ovation			2
how do you explain to a @entity70 growing up in @entity9 that a room full of people cheered when an elected official called you a cancer who must be cut out of @entity51 ? on tuesday , @entity8 appeared on a local news program to answer questions about his comments			1
did he apologize ? nope , instead he doubled down with the remark , " @entity2 who subscribe to @entity17 are just as bad as @entity18			0
" in reality , @entity2 organizations across the nation , including one in @entity8 's own state , have publicly denounced @entity18 and condemned their actions as not only being horrific but as also being un-islamic			1
could @entity8 's comments lead to violence against @entity2 ? i think so			2
also sharing my concern is @entity90 , the head of the @entity9 chapter of the @entity92 ( @entity92 )			2
@entity90 explained to me that @entity8 's remarks had crossed the line " from inflammatory rhetoric to a call to violence that might incite people who might not know any better			1
" in fact , @entity90 's @entity92 chapter has urged the @entity2 community in @entity9 to take precautions after recent hate crimes were committed against @entity48 in @entity104			1
now , saying @entity8 is simply an @entity6 bigot would n't be fair			2
he 's so much more			0
for example , last month when the shooting of @entity107 by a @entity109 , @entity110 , police officer was in the news , @entity8 took to @entity22 to express his anger			2
was he upset the police shot an unarmed black teenager ? nope , he was livid that the @entity117 administration had sent representatives to " this thug 's funeral " ( referring to @entity107 ) and to @entity121 's , but did n't do the same when certain famous white people had died			0
@entity8 also wrote sarcastically that the police officer who shot @entity107 could never be innocent because he 's a " white cop ! " ( his capitalization			0
) and in july , after a federal appeals court struck down @entity9 's constitutional amendment barring gay marriage , @entity8 stated that he was " angry " with the decision and vowed to fight , " to retake our freedoms from this overreaching federal government			1
" to @entity8 , gay @entity51 having the freedom to marry is somehow depriving him of his own freedom			1
the real story though is n't a hateful elected official			0
we have all seen that before			0
the bigger development was the reaction of @entity9 's religious and social justice groups to @entity8			1
instead of dividing the community , @entity8 had brought together @entity24 , @entity145 and @entity17 groups as well as organizations like the @entity147 and the @entity148 to stand together at a press conference to denounce @entity8 and demand an apology			1
rabbi @entity151 of @entity153 's @entity152 told me , " i respect people of all religions , or no religions , who abide by @entity51 's core values of tolerance and respect			0
it 's unfortunate that rep. @entity8 does not			0
" i also spoke with the president of the @entity165 of the @entity147 , @entity166 , who said it was too late for @entity8 to apologize , it was time for him to resign			0
@entity166 , a @entity168 veteran , commented that @entity8 is " promoting hatred and possibly even violence against @entity2 with his comments and there 's simply no place for that from our elected officials			0
" @entity8 is running unopposed in this november 's election			0
however , maybe the good people of his district will write in another candidate to replace him			0
bigotry is a " cancer that must be cut out of the @entity51 society			1
" a step towards achieving that dream would be defeating @entity8 on november 4 .			0

a state representative from @entity9 said @entity48 are a ' cancer ' in @entity51 society
@entity191 says the official has been *responsible* for other hateful rhetoric
he says that the response of the religious community in denouncing @entity8 is *encouraging*
