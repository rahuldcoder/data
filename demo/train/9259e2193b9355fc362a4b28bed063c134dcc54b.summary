-- when author and psychotherapist @entity2 used to make his annual trek to the @entity6 shore with his family and friends , he 'd be sure to pack more than sunscreen and swim trunks			2
" i used to always take work , " says @entity2 , author of " chained to the desk : a guidebook for @entity14 , their partners and @entity16 and the @entity17			2
" @entity2 recalls his partner would search their luggage for telltale signs that he was smuggling work along on their vacation			1
but @entity2 was careful to conceal tightly folded papers containing work notes in the pockets of his jeans , where they remained hidden			2
quiz : are you a workaholic ? at the beach , when family and friends suggested a walk on the sand or a swim , @entity2 would feign exhaustion and pretend to lie down for a nap			0
" i would work furiously while they were gone and then pretend to sleep ( when they returned ) , " he says			2
why is @entity42 the ' no - vacation nation ' ? @entity2 says there 's a distinct difference between a hard worker and a workaholic			1
a workaholic may seem happy on the outside , but underneath they 're driven by anxiety and fear			1
" the workaholic is on the ski slopes screaming about how he needs to get back to work , while the healthy worker is at work dreaming of being out on the ski slopes , " he says			0
@entity2 's vacation subterfuge is common behavior for true workaholics			1
" it seemed perfectly normal and essential , " he says of his inability to leave work unattended while on vacation			1
" that 's the desperation : you feel like you can never catch up			0
one of the things that you know is that work is a distraction , it gives you a sense of calm , helps you stay focused , but as soon as you finish a project , there 's that sense of getting out of control			0
" for @entity2 , a vacation away from work made him feel powerless and overwhelmed			1
and some studies suggest many @entity42 may feel similarly tethered to their cubicles			1
according to a 2009 @entity81 by @entity82 , 34 % of employed @entity42 do n't use all of their annual vacation days , and 19 % reported they postponed or canceled vacation for work - related reasons			1
a recent survey by @entity89 / @entity88 found that 57 % of @entity42 workers use all the vacation days they 're entitled to			1
for those of us who do break free from the confines of their cubicles long enough to dip their toes in warm waters or relax away from the office , many ca n't seem to leave work behind			1
@entity82 reports that 30 % of vacationing workers feel work - related stress while on vacation			1
" companies should be very wary of the collateral damage that workaholics can inflict on their co-workers , " says @entity103 , a senior faculty member at the @entity104 , a nonprofit institution that specializes in leadership education and research			0
@entity103 says work - addicted employees can create wear and tear with their hard - driven attitudes and expectations			1
it 's a behavior that companies must address before the workaholic burns out himself or creates too much friction with other employees			0
" it 's hard because ( workaholic tendencies ) are rewarded in lower to mid-management levels , but at the executive level , that same work ethic becomes a disadvantage , " says @entity103 , who explains that workaholics tend to get away with their over-the - top behaviors as long as the people they affect directly work below them			1
at the executive level , workaholics find themselves in tough company			0
now , their obsessive behaviors may affect peers who do n't like being bullied			0
companies that want to create a better life / work balance should employ executives who model the behavior they 'd like to see in their middle and lower management workers , @entity103 says			1
" i do n't care much about written policies , " says @entity103			0
" ( effective leaders ) take all their vacation time , and when they 're on vacation they cut the cord			0
" senior managers should be wary of handing out promotions , bonuses and verbal praise to work addicted employees unless their goal is to foster an office environment wrought with fear and frustration			1
" i 've had patients who are afraid to take their lunch break -- let alone a vacation -- for fear that someone is angling for their jobs , " says @entity2			2
" they fear that they wo n't be seen as team players			2
" @entity2 , who sought help for his work addiction after almost losing his family and friends , now counsels people who battle work addiction			0
he says some of his clients say it 's not worth taking vacation because the act of preparing to leave is overwhelming			0
others say they feel shadowed by their work as ubiquitous technology like e-mail , instant messaging , texting and @entity176 keeps the job just a few clicks away			2
@entity2 says workaholics who seek treatment are challenged to set boundaries in their lives that allow them to slowly reclaim a balanced life			1
in the end , workaholics often confront major crisis in their lives -- either mental or physical -- before they seek help for their addiction			2
for @entity190 ( last name withheld to protect identity ) , an entrepreneur who had been working an intense cycle of 20 - hour days for nearly eight months , a mental breakdown was the wake - up call he needed to seek help			1
" my behavior was outrageous , but i just could n't see it , " he recalls			0
" workaholics see themselves as indispensable and sometimes that 's true			0
" " many do rise in the corporate culture , but you have to choose if you want to live or if you want to work , " he added			0
@entity190 sought treatment for his addiction and found help in @entity206 , a 12 - step program that has between 5,000 and 6,000 members nationwide			2
" i started using the 12 steps and bringing more balance to my life , " says @entity190			0
" i started looking inside and found that i was the problem			0
self - honesty helps me make much better choices , " he says .			0
