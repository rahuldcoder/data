you squirt it on your hands as you catch the office elevator for lunch , and then again on your way home			0
you have bottles in your bathroom and kitchen , too -- and you use them often			0
you think ( hope ? ) that your hand - sanitizer habit is protecting you from colds and flu and gross bugaboos like @entity14			1
but even if it is n't , it 's harmless			2
right ? the rumor : hand sanitizer is not only ineffective , it 's toxic word on the street has it that despite how clean your hands feel after using a hand sanitizer , they 're actually still dirty -- and using sanitizers might actually lower your resistance to disease			1
is it true ? ! upwave : is it true that an apple a day keeps the doctor away ? the verdict : soap and water beats sanitizers hands - down when it comes to safety and effectiveness , the main concern with hand sanitizers is triclosan , which is the main antibacterial ingredient in nonalcoholic hand sanitizers			1
" there 's no good evidence that triclosan - containing products have a benefit , " says @entity44 , associate professor of epidemiology at the @entity46			1
in @entity52 and the @entity53 , hospitals wo n't even use them , she notes ; it 's thought that they do n't reduce infections or illness			2
dr. @entity58 , a medical epidemiologist at the @entity59 , says , " @entity60 - containing products do n't provide any disease protection beyond what you get from washing with soap and water			1
" research has shown that triclosan can disrupt the endocrine system , amplifying testosterone			2
in animal studies , it reduced muscle strength			2
it may also harm the immune system			0
whether these findings add up to human toxicity is n't established yet , but the @entity77 is currently reviewing the issue			1
upwave : how to prevent getting sick when you travel a more established concern : " when you expose bacteria to triclosan , it can elicit antibiotic resistance , " says @entity44			1
" once the resistance is transferred , [ pathogenic ] bacteria can become resistant to many types of antibiotics			0
" ( quaternary ammonium , another antibacterial found in nonalcoholic hand sanitizers , has also been shown to elicit antibiotic resistance , she says			1
) the main concern with triclosan , however , is that it does n't protect against viruses or fungi			1
" colds are caused by viruses , not bacteria , " @entity44 points out			0
bottom line ? skip it			0
alcohol - based sanitizers , on the other hand , are fairly effective and safe			1
" @entity107 sanitizers that are 60 % alcohol are good at killing bacterial pathogens , " says @entity58			1
they can also kill some viruses , but not all of them -- such as the noroviruses that can cause cruise - ship outbreaks			2
" they 're not a panacea , but if you ca n't wash your hands , a squirt of an alcohol - based hand gel is a good idea , " she says			1
adds @entity44 , " if you ca n't get to a sink quickly , an alcohol - based sanitizer is a good alternative [ to washing with soap and water ]			1
" one caveat : they do n't work on visibly dirty hands -- the alcohol ca n't get past the dirt			0
upwave : get dangerous germs out of your home and that brings us back to soap and water -- which is both safe and effective			2
try to suds up after you use the toilet and before you prepare food ; studies show that doing so can drastically reduce the risk of diarrhea			1
" hand - washing campaigns reduce absenteeism in schools , " says @entity58 , " and that means parents miss fewer days of work , too			2
" to see these effects , though , you have to wash your hands correctly			0
" you need to wash for about 24 seconds to remove the bacteria and viruses from your hands , " says @entity44			0
" most people do n't wash their hands properly			0
you need to cover all parts of your hands , including under your nails -- and then dry your hands well			0
" how long is 24 seconds ? about as long as it takes to sing the " @entity164 " song two times through			0
so feel free to do that as you suds up			0

main concern with hand sanitizers is triclosan , the main antibacterial ingredient
there 's no good evidence that triclosan products have a benefit , *experts* say
@entity77 is reviewing studies that show triclosan may be toxic to humans
alcohol - based sanitizers are fairly effective at killing bacterial pathogens , and safe
