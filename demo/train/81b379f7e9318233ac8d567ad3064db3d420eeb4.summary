-- wish you could play video games at work ? how about a happy hour with free drinks every week ? or exercise breaks during the day ? as much as these activities may sound like the opposite of work , companies around the world are starting to integrate them into their environments			1
the theory is that encouraging " play " at work not only boosts morale but also fosters increased creativity and teamwork , leading to better productivity and quality of work			1
you may have heard about the free food and @entity24 scooters at @entity25 , the famed multistory slide at @entity27 , or the climbing wall and yoga classes at @entity30 , but it 's not just tech companies that are jumping on the trend			1
industries from food to marketing are giving it a shot , too			2
so we could n't help but wonder : does the idea of play at work , well , work ? and do employees actually take advantage of it ? scientific data on both is limited ( do n't worry , the @entity47 for play is on it ) , but we heard from a variety of professionals who are convinced play is the way to go			1
" the emphasis on fun spawns creative energy , " explains @entity54			1
she 's creative director at marketing agency @entity58 in @entity59 , where play is a priority			1
" inspiration comes from interacting with one another and the world around us			2
" and how does the company foster that interaction ? with weekly happy hours , a snack bar , craft days , organized runs and even an in - office photo booth			1
" the photo booth is always a draw , stuffing as many random people in a tight space as possible -- i think the record is seven -- and taking goofy group shots , " said @entity76			0
the company has also tried even wackier ideas , like a petting zoo			0
" our office is our playground , " she said			1
it " was designed to ignite imaginations and encourage employees to interact , because that is how the best ideas are born			0
" business experts agree that we 're living in a time when traits like imagination and creativity are of the utmost importance in business			1
@entity98 calls it the " creative age , " and @entity100 has dubbed it the " conceptual age			0
" " in the same way that machines have replaced our bodies in certain kinds of jobs , software is replacing our left brains by doing sequential , logical work , " @entity104 explained in a 2009 interview with @entity106			0
" what 's important now are the characteristics of the brain 's right hemisphere : artistry , empathy , inventiveness , big - picture thinking			0
these skills have become first among equals in a whole range of business fields			1
" at @entity129 , a health information and technology company just outside @entity131 , social media manager @entity127 has another theory about why play is critical			1
" i 've been in fun offices like this and ones that were not as fun , and the retention rates are much higher when you have a few fun things to do around the office , " he said , particularly among millenials			1
" we have an extremely talented but fairly younger workforce who expects the office to be more than just a desk and a chair , " @entity127 said			2
" my coworkers love having a chance to take mini-breaks and rest their minds before moving onto a new task			0
" at @entity129 , those breaks could include anything from foosball or @entity157 tournaments to a team bike ride during the lunch hour			0
" some of our most creative business ideas come from this ' downtime , ' " he added			2
of course , in a difficult economy , not all workers feel comfortable participating in the fun			2
" we have a tv and lounge area			0
but i 'd be afraid of looking unproductive and under - worked if i utilized it , " wrote @entity169 in a comment on @entity171			0
" the rest seem to agree too because the lounge area has been sat on once since it was implemented			0
" it 's up to management to change that perception , says @entity178 , president of native marketing			0
" it has been a problem for many employees because they may feel that the idea ' play ' is just given lip service by management , " he said			1
" knowing it 's required is the only way this works			0
and the only way this happens is for senior staff to lead by example			0
if you have a ping - pong table , but do n't play , your ... employees will not play			2
" " talking about ' play ' and actually playing makes all the difference , " he added .			2
