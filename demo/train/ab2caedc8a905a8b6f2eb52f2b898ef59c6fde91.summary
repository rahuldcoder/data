-- the men 's @entity1 hoops championship game is tonight , and we ca n't tell you whether @entity6 or @entity7 is going to win			0
we can predict two things , though			0
the winning team will cut down the nets			1
and @entity11 will show a highlight montage set to the song " @entity14			1
" let 's take a look at the origins of these traditions			0
who 's responsible for college teams cutting down the nets after big wins ? @entity24 coach @entity23 did n't realize he was starting a trend in 1947			1
he just wanted a souvenir			1
@entity28 's @entity27 wrote a terrific piece on the origins of college hoops ' net - cutting tradition in 2005			0
according to @entity27 , coach case was so delighted with the @entity36 's @entity35 title win that he decided to cut down the nets as souvenirs			1
of course , being a pioneer can be tough			0
since @entity23 was the first coach to cut down the nets , arena workers did n't have a ladder at the ready for his big moment			1
instead , his players had to hoist their coach onto their shoulders as he did his snipping			1
case might not have been the true inventor of the net - cutting tradition , though			0
while he deservedly gets credit for being the college coach who popularized the net - cutting ritual , some sources -- including @entity53 's " @entity52 " -- claim case actually brought the tradition with him from @entity59 , where he 'd been a hugely successful high school coach before coming to @entity60 to coach the @entity36			2
either way , cutting down the nets may have remained an obscure @entity64 tradition had @entity23 not brought the practice to the national stage			1
@entity0 : who invented the @entity69 shower ? what about the other big postgame tradition , the tourney highlight montage set to " @entity14 " ? glad you asked			1
any hoops fan can tell you that the song is pretty cheesy and more than a little over-the - top			0
it 's also one of the best parts of @entity11 ' annual coverage of the @entity80			0
where the heck did " @entity14 " come from , and why do we only hear it once a year ? to be fair , there are really only so many opportunities to play a slightly sappy song about basketball			1
@entity87 of the @entity88 wrote a profile on @entity90 , the composer of the tune , in 2007			1
the song is actually the product of an ill - fated attempt to woo a woman			1
in 1986 , @entity90 was an unknown 31 - year - old folk singer when he went to a bar in @entity97 , @entity98 , to watch a @entity100 game			1
when a beautiful waitress sat down next to him after her shift , @entity90 decided to spark conversation by chatting about @entity105 's hoops abilities			2
believe it or not , the singer 's ploy did n't work			0
@entity90 told @entity87 that he resolved to write a tune that could show the waitress who snubbed him just how beautiful basketball could be			2
the next morning he wrote the song on a napkin in 20 minutes			0
@entity0 : college bowl game economics the song might have faded into oblivion as one of the odder " i 'll show them all ! " pipedreams a folk singer has ever had			0
@entity90 had a well - placed buddy , though			2
journalist @entity120 had been a high school classmate of @entity90 's , and he passed a demo tape of the song around to network producers			2
@entity11 liked the song and bought it for use in a highlight package it planned to air after @entity128			0
( yes , the iconic hoops song was very nearly a football song			0
) the package did n't make the final cut when the broadcast ran long , but the network revived it following the 1987 @entity80			0
the package with " @entity14 " was a huge hit , and @entity11 has kept it around ever since			2
@entity90 provided the vocals for the original version of the song , but some big names have belted out the tune since			2
@entity142 took over vocal duties for a few years in the 90s before @entity145 recorded his own version			1
@entity147 sang the song for last year 's championship package , but fans roundly criticized her version			1
( it 's worth noting , though , that fans were mostly irked that producers had inserted so many shots of @entity156 in the highlight montage ; nobody 's debating that @entity156 's a tremendous singer			0
