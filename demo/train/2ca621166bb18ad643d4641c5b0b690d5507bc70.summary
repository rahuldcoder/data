the submarine 's body may be constructed from drainage pipes and the hatch from a recycled skylight , but according to its 18 - year - old inventor , this single - person u-boat can plunge to a depth of 30 feet and has already completed three successful dives			1
the @entity9 took high school inventor @entity10 just six months and $ 2,000 to put together -- all while keeping on top of his homework			1
" he has been building things since he was two years old , " says his mother , @entity14			2
" if we tried to help him we would just get in the way and mess things up			2
" the submarine has ballast tanks to maintain its depth and equilibrium ; air vents that bring oxygen down from the surface ; a functioning pa and a range of emergency systems including back - up batteries , a siren , strobe lights , a breathing apparatus and a pump to fight leaks			1
the vessel can remain submerged for up to two hours and travels beneath the waves at one and a half miles per hour			1
@entity14 says he is going to use it to " explore the lake , see fish and hopefully find a bit of history , like the cannons from my neighbors ' historic house " that , he says , were dumped in the lake during renovations in the 1960s			2
when he was younger , @entity14 began by making things out of balloons and string , but as the years went by his inventions grew in scale and complexity			2
at the age of 12 , instead of complaining about having to help with the housework , he developed a remote - controlled car that could mop and vacuum			1
@entity14 's website is a testament to his enormous productivity			2
it is a menagerie of home - constructed machines including boats , planes , architectural constructions , and prize - winning robots			1
the materials he uses in his creations are often technological cast - offs from family and friends , or garbage scavenged from electronics recycling facilities			1
the @entity9 has regulators and pressure gauges from an old restaurant soda fountain that @entity14 found behind a shopping center			2
the two main batteries are from a child 's ride - on toy , and its @entity28 speakers are made from an old car stereo			1
@entity14 says he decided to build the submarine because " i wanted to see if i could do it			1
it combined so many different aspects of things that i had worked on in the past			2
" the @entity9 has the most ambitious wiring system @entity14 has installed since he constructed his tree fort -- a veritable forest castle that puts all other tree forts to shame			0
armed with more modern conveniences than many proper homes , the fort has a tv , wall - mounted speakers , desktop computer , air conditioning , shelving , and fluorescent lights			1
" it has everything a house should have , " says @entity14 , " except a refrigerator and a bathroom			0
" the @entity9 is not @entity14 's first submarine			1
in fact , it is his fourth			0
the previous iteration could dive to five feet , but had a less sturdy frame constructed from plastic containers and duct tape			1
it was propelled by two motor scooter engines , connected to metal blades and two 12v batteries			0
the new design improves on previous models in almost every way			0
" i had an idea of how i wanted to sit			0
i realized that lying down would make the sub more streamlined -- so the drainage pipes seemed a natural fit , " he said			0
but sacrifices to the original design had to be made along the way			0
" the ballast tanks were originally going to be air tanks , but they were just too expensive			0
if i could have learned how to weld i would have made the whole thing out of metal			0
but that might be for the next one			0
" asked if there are any particular challenges which are specific to being a young inventor , @entity14 responds plainly : " no. other than the budget issues and all of my schoolwork and other obligations that get in the way			0
" if he had more time and money @entity14 says he would like to continue to add to the submarine			1
" i would love to add a robotic claw to the front			0
i would like to make the sub into a more useful thing with a basket the claw could put stuff into to pick up garbage and clean the bottom of the lake			0

@entity169 *student* @entity10 builds one - man submarine
the submarine can dive to 30 feet and travels at one and a half miles per hour
inventive teen has also built airplanes , boats , robots , and architectural constructions
