@entity0 -- world leaders poured into @entity0 on wednesday , 20 years after the landmark @entity4 , to commit themselves to a new roadmap for sustainable development -- with that roadmap already under fire for failing to set firm goals			1
the three - day @entity10 opened with words of warning from the @entity13 secretary - general ban ki - moon			1
" let us match words with actions , " he told reporters			2
" our scarcest resource is time , and it is running out			2
" more than 50,000 delegates are expected to participate in the conference , which is aimed at promoting economic growth and poverty reduction while simultaneously preserving the planet 's resources			1
population growth ca n't be ignored but the summit has been overshadowed by the crisis in @entity29 and by key elections in the @entity31 and elsewhere that have hobbled governments ' ability , or willingness , to act			1
notable no - shows included @entity31 president @entity37 , @entity39 prime minister @entity38 and @entity41 chancellor @entity40			1
negotiations over a final document that would be signed by leaders when they flew in dragged on until the last moment because countries could not agree on many of the more polemic issues			2
even @entity49 said he had higher expectations			2
" i know some member states hoped to have a bolder and more ambitious outcome document , " @entity49 said			0
" i also hoped that we should have a more ambitious outcome document			0
" the resulting text is an often vague commitment to sustainable development , without measurable targets or financial commitments			0
can summit solve environmental problems ? many member states nonetheless praised the host government for getting all countries to finally agree on a document			0
the @entity31 delegation , represented by secretary of state @entity67 , called the summit a " historic opportunity to communicate the value of sustainable development and help galvanize real - world , collaborative action to stimulate growth , protect the environment and provide a healthy future for our citizens			1
" businesses played a much bigger role at this summit than they did 20 years ago , with many observers saying they have actually taken the lead by providing real examples of sustainable development			0
@entity86 , head of the @entity13 @entity87 , said his group hopes to increase the number of companies agreeing to concrete sustainable development goals to 20,000 , from 7,000			0
" i hope also we will be able to inspire governments to have the courage to set the right incentives , " he told @entity1			0
extinction threat ' a call to world leaders ' on wednesday , the first session of the high - level summit was addressed by 17 - year - old activist @entity101 of @entity102 , who challenged leaders : " are you here to save face or are you here to save us ? " @entity49 suggested that the highly criticized final document could still be revised by world leaders before the summit ends on friday			0
when asked by reporters about that possibility , he responded : " why do we have a summit meeting ? why have i been inviting and urging leaders , heads of state and government ? they are the ones who can make political decisions , who can make a choice			1
