-- this sunday , my family will be among the 110 million people gathered in front of their tvs to watch the @entity7 , and with ad revenue projected at $ 300 million , we can expect advertisers to be as outrageous as ever , with spots promoting junk food , alcohol and erectile dysfunction drugs and depicting violence , sex and gender stereotypes			1
this said , tv ads -- even during the @entity7 -- might be the least of parents ' concerns			1
digital media has dramatically changed the advertising landscape , and includes immersive websites , " advergaming , " viral marketing , mobile ads , social media marketing and precise behavioral and location targeting			1
more than ever before , advertising and entertainment are inextricably linked			0
in many cases , the content is the ad , and this can be particularly confusing for children , who are less able to understand persuasive intent			0
@entity37 just released a research brief -- " advertising to children and teens : current practices " -- to provide an inventory of advertising practices aimed at kids and teens and calling for research to quantify exposure and examine the effects			0
the report finds that the integration of advertising and content across so many platforms -- from product placement to online games and @entity57 apps -- has made it much more difficult for researchers to measure the exposure and impact of advertising on kids			2
while traditional advertising and its effects on kids have been well researched , no one knows the impact of these new media platforms			2
the concern is n't just what products are sold to kids or what messages are sent to them , it 's that new modes of advertising are insidious and particularly troubling for kids and teens , who are less able to differentiate advertising from entertainment and whose sense of self is still developing			2
what does it mean for a tween or teen girl to receive weight - loss ads , targeted to her based on her age , gender , location , the foods she likes and the topics she searches ? we need to understand the impact of this type of advertising on young people , what it means for their consumption habits , self - esteem , and right to privacy			0
kids are also becoming a critical part of the product - selling cycle , without being paid ( or even knowing , in many cases )			1
even @entity7 advertisers are relying on our kids in large part to spread the word for them			1
for example , @entity111 ' " @entity113 " ad contest has been seeking votes all over the @entity115 -- including the kids ' game site @entity116 -- where information can be collected , and where likes , shares and views are the new measure of success			0
and a young person 's " liking " or " sharing " of a product may appear in their friends ' newsfeeds as endorsements or testimonials			0
no longer can you simply hit the mute button or fast - forward through the @entity135 of kids will be on phones and tablets while watching the big game and the ads they interact with on these little screens -- that might not even register as ads -- have far greater implications for kids ' healthy development			1
media and ad savvy is now an essential skill and it 's imperative we teach our kids to view media critically -- to understand what 's being sold and what methods are used to sell products			1
and we must call upon the research community to develop new methods to quantify and analyze the effects of advertising on young people , not just to limit what 's negative but to have a better understanding of how to reach kids with positive messages			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

kids will see @entity7 ads for junk food and *booze* , with violence , sex and sexism
@entity169 : digital media ads are insidious : " advergaming , " viral and social media marketing
he says kids are a part of the product - selling cycle , without being paid or even knowing
media and ad savvy is essential , he says . we must teach kids to view media critically
