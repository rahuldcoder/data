@entity1 , @entity0 -- reports conflicted wednesday over whether the 84 - year - old former president of @entity0 , @entity4 , was clinically dead			1
the state - run @entity6 , citing medical sources , said he was declared clinically dead shortly after arriving late tuesday at a military hospital in @entity1 , where he had been taken after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest earlier in the day			1
but gen. @entity13 , a member of the @entity14 , told @entity2 , " he is not clinically dead as reported , but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition			1
" fast facts on the life of @entity4 @entity4 was taken by helicopter to the military hospital in the @entity23 suburb of @entity1 , @entity13 said			1
" he had a heart attack and his heart stopped and he was saved by electric shocks , then placed on respirator , " he said			2
" his pulse is 40			0
he then got a brain clot			0
he is not clinically dead as reported but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition			2
" and @entity4 's lawyer , @entity31 , told @entity2 , " he has been in a coma for hours now			1
he has had water on the lungs for 10 days now and his blood pressure is down today , which obstructed his breathing and forced doctors to put him on a respirator			0
he was given medicine intravenously to relieve the brain clot , and electric shocks were used to revive him but there was no substantial response			0
he is not dead as reported			2
" @entity31 added that @entity4 's wife , @entity44 , was at his side			1
he blamed @entity14 for not having moved @entity4 last week from the prison to the hospital			1
@entity48 , the official spokesman of the @entity0 prosecutor , had said earlier , " we were informed by prison authority that @entity4 's heart has stopped and they used electric shocks and cpr to resurrect him			1
he is now on an artificial respirator and doctors from the armed forces and @entity59 will inspect him			0
" @entity60 reported that @entity4 had suffered a stroke			1
he was taken from @entity63 hospital to @entity23 military hospital , @entity31 told @entity2			0
" he has suffered a stroke , but he is not dead			1
" the prosecutor and the military council denied @entity4 had been moved			1
his health had been reported in decline since he was ousted as president of @entity0 in february 2011 and found guilty of charges related to the killings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators during the revolution			0
last week , an @entity76 spokesman said he was comatose ; the spokesman said he suffered from high blood pressure , irregular heartbeats and difficulty breathing			2
" we should be skeptical , " said @entity81 , a senior fellow at @entity83 's @entity82			2
" there 's a great @entity87 expression i like and it asks the following question : when you 're told that someone is dead , you say , ' is he dead and buried , or just dead ? ' i think we are in the middle of this kind of situation			1
" " clinically dead is not a phrase that is commonly used , but when it is used , what it usually means is that someone is brain dead , " said @entity2 senior medical correspondent @entity94			1
" in the @entity101 , we would call this person dead because they have no brain activity			2
" meanwhile , crowds jammed @entity106 once again on wednesday			0
but their focus this time was not on @entity4			1
instead , it was on the power grab by the @entity0 military , which last week issued a constitutional decree that stripped the position of president of much of its power after a top court dissolved the parliament			0
those moves were followed by the nation 's first presidential election , which pitted @entity123 candidate @entity122 against @entity4 's former prime minister , @entity124			1
final results have not been announced			0
" it 's a media stunt to divert attention from the constitutional decree , " said @entity126 , a demonstrator in the square			2
" if he 's really dead , it wo n't make a difference			1
we 've started a sit - in and wo n't leave unless the @entity14 leaves unconditionally			2
" " i 've come from far away			0
i 'm not leaving until @entity122 swears the oath in front of the legitimately elected parliament , " said demonstrator @entity136			0
" i do n't care about @entity4			1
these are games played by the intelligence services			0
" " if he 's really dead , its @entity143 's will , " said @entity142 , another demonstrator			1
" i would hope he lives to see the new president			0
" outside @entity147 , shortly before midnight tuesday , there was no additional security			0
instead , there were a few policemen outside the main gate and two military police inside the gate			0
across the street perhaps a half - dozen journalists sat on the curb smoking cigarettes			2
