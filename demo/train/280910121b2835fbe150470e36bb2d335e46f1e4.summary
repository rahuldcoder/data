-- @entity2 - winning actress @entity1 is dedicated to ending human trafficking			1
she serves as a goodwill ambassador for the @entity5 , and she frequently travels abroad to raise awareness about the issue			1
@entity1 also been involved with @entity8 since 2007 , the first year of the campaign			1
she recently sat down with @entity8 producer @entity10 to talk about the campaign and her humanitarian work			1
below are excerpts from that interview			2
@entity10 : tell me about your work fighting human trafficking			1
why did you get involved , and what exactly do you do ? @entity1 : trafficking is the worst kind of human depravity that you can imagine			1
and it involves children and the most vulnerable , the poorest of the poor			2
so , everywhere i go with the @entity26 , in addition to doing our official duties and holding our press conferences , i interview victims			1
i basically consider myself a victim 's advocate			2
i feel like that that 's the best way that i can expose the really horrendous nature of the crime to the public and try to produce swifter results			2
because once you get to know individuals who have suffered at the hands of traffickers ... who have lived to tell the tale , it is so disturbing and heartbreaking that you feel compelled to act			2
you feel compelled to work against it			0
it 's definitely a cause worth fighting for			0
@entity10 : what is a hero to you ? @entity1 : a hero is someone who braves extraordinary risk and gives so much more of him or herself ... to uplift someone or many people who are suffering			1
@entity10 : do you have any personal heroes ? @entity1 : the first one that comes to mind for me is @entity61			1
he was always my hero			0
that was always who i aspired to be like if i could be like anybody in a moral , human way			2
i read all of his speeches and his autobiography , and i just try to learn from his path and what he did			0
@entity10 : you were a presenter at the first " @entity8 : an all - star tribute " back in 2007			1
what was that like ? @entity1 : it was really amazing			1
i was extremely moved by all the extraordinary things that all the various heroes had done			0
and that the emphasis of such a prestigious show -- on acts of altruism and selflessness and service -- is exactly what the world 's focus should be on			0
it combats the ridiculous frothiness of reality tv and the consumerism that has sort of become our national religion			0
human acts of kindness and love -- and love borne out by action -- is really what life is all about			2
it 's about how much you 're giving , not how much you 're getting			0
so it 's an extraordinary show , and i was really , really proud to be a part of it			0
@entity10 : did any of those @entity8 particularly inspire you ? @entity1 : you know , they all did			1
i was just sort of in awe , one after the next			0
they just inspired me further to do what little i can on my side in any of my activism or things that i 'm trying to do			1
it 's just like : " ok , yeah , you can do this			0
you can get involved , and you can try to make a small difference			2
" @entity10 : why do you think we need to honor everyday heroes ? @entity1 : it 's really inspirational			1
but you know there 's lots of ways to be a hero , too			0
there are many people who are heroic in their everyday life and their everyday generosity			0
some people are gigantic heroes who save people from burning buildings , and some people are just saving people by loving them in a constant and almost superhuman way			0
i think it 's a wonderful thing .			0
