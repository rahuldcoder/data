@entity0 -- human rights groups met a somewhat skeptical @entity3 on tuesday as they presented arguments on whether foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity can sue corporations and other organizations in @entity12 federal courts			1
the cases argued could have enormous global impact from a moral , political , and financial perspective			2
at issue is the scope of two federal laws that are increasingly being used in an effort to hold businesses accountable for human rights atrocities committed overseas			2
two separate civil cases before the high court involve @entity25 political activists claiming foreign oil companies were complicit in violent abuse at the hands of the country 's military ; and an @entity12 family alleging their father was tortured and killed while in the custody of the @entity34 and the @entity35			1
both cases were earlier blocked from going to trial in federal courts , for separate legal reasons			2
now the justices are being asked to sort out whether political groups and corporations enjoy broad immunity , and whether the @entity12 laws intend only for individuals to be held liable for international law violations			1
" there 's no connection to the @entity12 whatsoever " in these lawsuits , said justice @entity47			1
the statute being challenged here " was enacted -- there seems to be a consensus -- to prevent international tension , and this kind of lawsuit only creates international tension			0
" but justice @entity59 , an active questioner , was convinced such cases could proceed			1
" take an example that has all the extraterritoriality aspects of this case taken away from it , " she said			0
" let 's assume that the @entity67 ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the @entity12 , and that that attack is by a corporate agent			1
would we say that the corporation there can not be sued " under the federal law ? the first appeal was filed on behalf of residents of the oil - abundant @entity78 area of the @entity80			0
two decades ago , they protested the long - standing environmental harm caused by @entity83 and other energy firms from the petroleum extraction			0
they and their families claim the @entity25 government brutally suppressed them , " aided and abetted " by private corporations doing business there			2
the @entity78 9 -- as the key leaders became known -- were allegedly detained , tortured , and tried by a special @entity25 military tribunal , in violation of international human rights treaties			0
the government 's 1993 - 95 crackdown sparked global outrage after author @entity98 and eight other activists were convicted , then hanged			2
among those bringing suit is his nephew , @entity102 , who escaped the @entity25 oppression and now lives in @entity104 as a political refugee			0
he described being a student activist beaten by soldiers for hours in front of a crowd of onlookers , then detained and tortured for days he claims @entity83 -- based in the @entity111 and @entity112 -- conspired with the government to keep its business operations going in the face of protests , and should be held accountable for ignoring or encouraging a pattern of killings , rapes , beatings , and property destruction			0
he said the only place to obtain justice is in the @entity12			1
" @entity25 's dictatorship has grown rich from its oil , " @entity124 told @entity1			2
" it is important those ( oil ) companies be held responsible , because we can not bring any legal action in courts in @entity25			0
" the law in question is the @entity135 , or @entity135 , which gives federal courts jurisdiction over claims from foreigners that they were harmed by international law violations			0
it was ignored for decades , but has now become an important legal vehicle for those bring human rights claims			0
similar lawsuits involve @entity145 and @entity147 energy operations in @entity148 ; @entity150 fruit farms in @entity151 ; and businesses that operated years ago in the now - outlawed apartheid system in @entity154			2
the high court in 2004 endorsed use of the ats , but only in limited circumstances			0
that approach was apparent among several of the conservative justices during tuesday 's two - hour oral arguments			1
" in this case , the corporations have residences and presence in many other countries where they have many more contacts than here , " justice @entity161 said			1
later he told the @entity173 administration lawyer supporting the @entity25 plaintiffs , " suppose an @entity12 corporation commits human trafficking with @entity12 citizens in the @entity12			1
under your view , the @entity12 corporation could be sued in any country in the world , and it would have no international consequences			1
we do n't look to the international consequences at all			0
" " if there is no other country where this suit could have been brought , regardless of what @entity12 domestic law provides , " asked chief justice @entity183 , " is n't that a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself contravenes international law ? " but @entity59 and justices @entity193 and @entity195 were skeptical about giving corporations a judicial free pass of sorts			1
@entity193 pointed out the @entity135 was passed more than two centuries ago in response to piracy on the high seas			1
he used a humorous hypothetical to make his point			0
" the principle that here would apply is @entity206 do you think in the 18th century if they 'd brought @entity206 ( to court in a lawsuit ) , and we get all their gold , and @entity212 gets up and he says : ' oh , it is n't me , it 's the corporation ' that is responsible -- do you think that they would have then said : ' oh , i see , it 's a corporation			1
' " " yes , the corporation would not be liable " even in that case , said attorney @entity219 , representing @entity83			0
the second case involves the @entity223 , passed two decades ago , and whether its provisions for liability for human rights abuses apply only to " natural persons			2
" the family of @entity34 - born @entity229 -- a naturalized @entity12 citizen -- claims intelligence officers are responsible for his beating death in 1995			1
@entity12 officials later said three of the officers were implicated in the incident , but @entity236 's relatives believe the @entity34 organizations that have defacto control of the disputed @entity240 territories hold ultimate responsibility			1
the civil lawsuits in the international law context have been compared to a separate , high - profile domestic political dispute			0
the high court in 2010 concluded corporations -- businesses , unions , and issue advocacy groups -- enjoy the same free speech rights as individuals when it comes to independent election spending			1
now the issue is whether corporations and political entities should be treated the same as individual offenders when it comes to enforcing international human rights			0
the cases are @entity263 ( 10 - 1491 ) and @entity229 v. @entity34 ( 11 - 88 )			0
rulings can be expected by late june .			0

two @entity12 cases seek to sue corporations for actions abroad
the justices are being asked to sort out whether laws intended for individuals apply
justice @entity47 : " there 's no connection to the @entity12 whatsoever " in these lawsuits
justice @entity193 : would @entity212 get off by *blaming* crimes on @entity206 ?
