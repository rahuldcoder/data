-- welcome to the world of rock and roll racing			2
" he loves the noise , he knows he 's a star , he poses for the photographs , " trainer @entity3 -- part of the team behind @entity6 , favorite for saturday 's @entity8 -- tells @entity0			1
" pure and simple he 's a rock star			1
" @entity6 's joint owner @entity13 is even more effusive			1
" we 've got one elderly gentleman who comes to the races who has a jackass tattoo on his shoulder , " explains @entity13 , a nod to the jackass on @entity6 's racing silks			1
" fans do n't do that unless you 're a rock star			1
people flock where he goes			2
" the equine equivalent of a musical superstar is also the main protagonist in a fairytale on a par with the great @entity34 , the diminutive thoroughbred racehorse which defied the odds and delighted a depression - hit @entity36 and whose story was turned into a movie 11 years ago			1
@entity6 must surely have @entity42 executives salivating at the prospect of how events might unfold at at @entity46 ' historic dirt track in @entity47 this weekend			2
the three - year - old colt 's remarkable tale began in the womb of @entity51 , a mare that @entity13 and co-owner @entity53 bought for $ 8,000 with a view to breeding			1
they bred her to the stallion @entity58 for a reduced fee of $ 2,000 , the first breeding the novice pair had ever undertaken			2
it could have been a case of first time lucky as their offspring has earned @entity13 and @entity53 more than $ 1 million in prize money and chalked up illustrious wins at the @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
his recent run of success -- four wins in his last four outings -- has marked @entity6 out as a pre-race favorite for the @entity8 -- the first race in horse racing 's coveted @entity76 , which also includes the @entity78 and the @entity79 -- in the chase for a purse of $ 2m			1
understandably , the horse 's value has rocketed , and is now estimated to be around $ 12m			1
@entity13 and @entity53 were recently offered $ 6m for a controlling 51 % stake in the horse , which they turned down			1
the whole story is so fanciful that the horse - owning partnership goes under the name @entity91 or @entity92 , hence the jackass on their colors			2
" when @entity53 and i bought the filly , one of the barn hands said we must be dumb asses to get into this game and hence the name , " @entity13 explains to @entity0			0
but through every strand and sinew there is a heart - warming tale behind @entity6			1
for a start , he races in the purple and green , the favorite colors of the duo 's respective wives			2
then there 's the location where the horse has been stabled			2
his neighbours at @entity116 racecourse in @entity117 are predominantly quarter horses , named for the quarter mile horse races that are regularly held at the track where @entity6 is exercised at 7.30 am every morning			1
if @entity6 wins the @entity8 he will also become the first @entity122 - trained horse to win since @entity124 's success in 1962			1
then there is the small matter of his 77 - year - old trainer @entity3 , who has just 15 horses in his yard but whose history with the @entity8 dates back to 1955			1
back then , @entity3 acted as the exercise rider for race winner @entity132 , who also happens to feature in the distant bloodline of @entity6			1
@entity3 , far younger and more energetic than his years would suggest , recalls : " i was barely 18 years old and my memories are a little bit different now			2
back then i was so young , it did n't mean so much			0
" i 've put 60 years into this business and i thought my chance in the @entity8 had gone			2
" now i 've got another chance			0
it 's a fairytale and i do believe in fate			0
he 'll be the horse to beat			0
he 's been awesome these last four races , we just hope he has five in him			0
but it 's a different ball game when 150,000 people are screaming at you			2
but he 's a rock star is n't he ? that should n't be a problem			1
" he just loves to run , he 'll run all day long			0
we just need some luck , that plays a big part in such a story			0
his story is just like that of @entity34 is n't it ? it 'd be a hell of a book or a movie if he pulls it off			2
" @entity3 's first win as a jockey aptly came at @entity168 in 1957 , where his current wonder horse first announced himself in the big time with victory in last year 's @entity173			1
that he should have ever got here bred by @entity53 , who works for a consumer safety firm , and @entity13 , whose company @entity176 makes the magnetic strips on credit cards , is remarkable , bearing in mind this is the first horse that @entity13 has ever raced			0
" one of the things on mine and my wife 's bucket list was to go to the @entity8 , " he says			1
" i 'll board the plane this year but i never imagined i 'd do it with a horse i own			0
" this whole thing is a fairytale coming true , it 's a dream			0
it 's better than a movie script because it 's coming true			0
people spend millions on horses each year and we 've spent basically $ 10,000			1
" the horse 's name was also literally picked out of a hat as the two owners and their spouses each put a name into a hat for a waitress at a @entity122 restaurant to select			1
the @entity8 favorite could just as easily have been called @entity207 at @entity208 but @entity13 's pick , @entity6 -- a nod to the white markings that are called chrome by horse racing aficionados -- proved the selection			1
whatever the name , the owners more often than not just call him junior but @entity13 believes if he succeeds at @entity46 saturday the he could become known as the " people 's horse " too			1
" i do believe he 's that , like @entity34 , " @entity13 adds			1
" he became the people 's horse in the depression because he was the little guy kicking the big guy			1
we 're doing that in the same kind of way			0
" no one ever gave it any credence and we should n't be where we are now			0
this is n't a blue - blooded horse , he 's a proper red - blooded colt			2
" we 're just two guys that worked hard and still have our days jobs			0
we get up at 4.30am every morning to go to work			0
well , i ca n't retire as i 'd be in my wife 's way and i think she 'd shoot me ! but we still work hard			0
we 're not guys who could buy whatever we want			0
" dream ending the unnamed purchaser who offered $ 6m , however , clearly was			1
surely @entity13 was tempted to give in ? " it felt like a slap in the face after all we 'd done , " he says			0
" you can have all the money in the world to buy every single grain of sand on a beach but you ca n't buy this story			0
" we 've worked hard for this , similarly @entity51 , which someone offered $ 1.5m for			0
this is n't about the money , this is about the dream and we want to finish off that dream			0
" whether that dream reaches fruition in @entity266 this weekend is another matter			0
some pre-race rain is a slight concern for @entity3 and his team but @entity13 has never once wavered in his expectation			2
" if he gets a clean run , he 'll win , " he says			0
" i 've said that before and i 've been told i 'm bold and arrogant			0
i 'm not either of those			0
i 'm just a man that loves this horse and believes in the fairytale			0
" saturday also happens to be @entity13 's 62nd birthday , could that be when his fairytale comes true ? @entity8 - fast facts			1

@entity6 cost just $ 10,000 and is shock favorite for saturday 's @entity8
trainer @entity3 , who has been involved with *classic* since 1950s , calls him a " rock star "
his owners recently turned down a $ 6m offer for a half - share in the horse
@entity6 has been called a *modern* - day @entity34 and the " people 's horse "
