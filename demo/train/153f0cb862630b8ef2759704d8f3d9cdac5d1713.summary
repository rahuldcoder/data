outrage over the recent killing of a healthy giraffe at a @entity5 zoo misses a crucial point , an official argued			1
" conservation is not always simple			0
it 's not always clean , " said @entity8 , executive director of the @entity9 , a @entity11 body governing 345 institutions			2
" i 'm afraid that when we have limited space in zoos -- and it 's limited because of problems in the wild , of course , and more and more animals need our help -- then we sometimes have to make these really tough decisions			2
" the @entity23 said it " euthanized " the animal , named @entity25 , to avoid inbreeding			1
a veterinarian shot @entity25 with a rifle as he leaned down to munch on rye bread , a favorite snack			1
after a necropsy , the giraffe was dismembered in front of an audience that included children and fed to the zoo 's lions , tigers and leopards			1
while some @entity43 zoo officials have said this is not standard practice for their facilities , @entity41 said that this can be chalked up to a misunderstanding about what is " normal in @entity5 culture " and that zoological experts could do a better job of communicating			1
" people have perhaps lost sight of the bigger picture and perhaps we as zoos have not been good at explaining why on very few occasions we need to make decisions like this , " she said			2
death threats staff at the zoo have received death threats as debate rages online over the killing , which took place despite a petition signed by thousands of animal lovers			1
several staff members were targeted after the giraffe was shot sunday , @entity23 spokesman @entity71 told @entity74 on monday			1
he added that @entity78 , director of research and conservation at @entity23 " received threats via telephone and e-mails			1
" opinion : why zoo was right to kill giraffe " our giraffes are part of an international breeding program , which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes , " @entity78 told @entity74			2
" it can only be done by matching the genetic composition of the various animals with the available space			0
... when giraffes breed as well as they do now , then you will inevitably run into so - called surplus problems now and then			0
" as for the public necropsy , @entity78 said monday that the zoo staff saw it as a learning opportunity because zoos have an obligation " not to make nature into a @entity104 , " but rather show those interested in " the real thing			1
" he further pointed out that most of the children in attendance brought their parents to the necropsy , not vice versa			0
" it 's not by accident that people came by here , " he said			1
this may speak to the cultural gap @entity41 referenced			0
at the @entity23 , she said , all euthanized animals are autopsied , with some parts used for research and the rest of the animal fed to the zoo 's carnivores			1
" they strongly believe that the public should know how autopsies are done , what is the work of a vet in the zoo , " she said			2
shame on whom ? that did n't dull the outrage sparked by the killing , as many people expressed their revulsion on the zoo 's facebook page			1
" i find the killing of innocent baby giraffe absolutely barbaric			0
and to do it in front of children just desensitizes them to brutal killing of animals			0
shame on you ! " @entity150 posted monday			0
however some users pointed out the hypocrisy of those who criticized the zoo without any understanding of the reasons behind the decision , or who ate meat without knowing its true origin			2
" the level of crass hypocrisy demonstrated by the vast majority of comments on this thread is absolutely repugnant			0
shame on you , armchair warrior , shame on you , " wrote @entity166			0
opinion : why killing @entity25 does n't stand up to scrutiny more than 27,000 people had signed a " @entity173 " petition , appealing for a last - minute change of heart			1
" the zoo has raised him so it is their responsibility to find him a home , " author @entity175 wrote on the petition site			2
when that petition failed , another petition popped up monday , titled , " @entity184 from the @entity185			0
" it had more than 16,000 signatures as of 3:30 p.m. et. zookeeper and tv personality @entity188 , who is also director emeritus of the @entity190 in @entity191 , joined the chorus of outrage monday , calling the @entity23 's decision " the most abominable , insensitive , ridiculous thing i 've ever heard of			1
" he also questioned why the @entity23 would keep breeding animals for which it did n't have room			1
the @entity190 would never put down an animal in this manner , @entity200 said , and he would n't condone showing an animal consume another animal to children			2
" i know it 's natural in nature			2
i 'm not an idiot , " he said , " but i do n't need to have some 2 - and 3 - and 6 - year - olds -- they can not understand at that age			1
you understand they do n't understand nature			1
they have n't been to @entity214 , so that 's what we do at the zoos			1
we try to educate people at zoos on what happens in the wild			0
" which is exactly what @entity78 argues the @entity23 was doing			2
as for exploring other purportedly more humane options , such as lethal injection or sterilization , @entity78 said that an injection would have contaminated about 200 kilograms of perfectly good meat , which was out of the question			0
he added , " if we just sterilize him , he will take up space for more genetically valuable giraffes			0
" options deemed not viable several zoos volunteered to take @entity25			2
the @entity237 's @entity236 , which said it has the capacity for an extra male , was among several places that offered to take him			0
@entity23 said in a q&a about the decision on its website , " it is not possible to transfer the giraffe to another zoo as it will cause inbreeding			1
" the @entity9 's @entity41 said some institutions were ruled out because they did not meet her organization 's strict protocols , and the @entity23 would n't send @entity25 to an institution with " lesser standards of welfare			1
" she further said that while @entity9 members are " saddened by the death of any animal in our care , " the @entity9 supports the @entity23 's decision and reiterated the zoo 's claim that " transfer within our network does not represent a solution to the unsuitability of the individual animal for breeding			1
" in the @entity9 's history , which dates to the early 1800s , its member zoos have put down only five giraffes , @entity41 said			0
numerous @entity43 zoos did not immediately respond to requests for interviews			0
the @entity277 declined a request , issuing a short statement from executive director @entity280 stating that @entity9 's " programs and procedures vary from those of the @entity277			0
" " through the @entity286 program , these methods include science - based breeding recommendations and cooperating to plan for adequate space , " @entity280 said in the statement			0
the @entity289 in @entity290 , @entity291 , also declined an interview but said its birth plans were managed by the @entity286			0
" with each new animal birth , @entity289 establishes a breeding and relocation plan that ensures a healthy and genetically sound future for the individual and species , " the statement said			0
to claims that the @entity23 acted irresponsibly by allowing @entity25 to be born if it had no room to house him , @entity41 said the giraffe was born more than two years ago , and it 's difficult to predict " genetic kinship " and a zoo 's available space that far out			1
as for preventing the giraffes from breeding , that would violate the @entity9 's standard of " providing a behavioral repertoire as natural as possible " for animals in captivity , she said .			0

@entity23 staff get death threats
those outraged do n't understand zoo protocol , " @entity5 culture , " official says
@entity23 said it shot @entity25 with rifle , fed his *carcass* to zoo 's carnivores
@entity328 sparked outrage , with many people expressing revulsion on @entity332
