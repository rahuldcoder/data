@entity0 , @entity1 -- fireworks lit the skies and crowds filled the streets of @entity1 's capital sunday after the territory 's parliament declared independence from @entity11 , a move backed by many @entity14 governments , but which @entity11 and @entity15 bitterly oppose			1
fireworks light up the night sky in @entity0 , @entity1 , as thousands celebrate independence			1
" the day has come , " prime minister @entity20 , a former separatist guerrilla leader , told his parliament			0
" from this day onwards , @entity1 is proud , independent and free			1
" the province has been under @entity24 administration and patrolled by @entity26 troops since a 1999 bombing campaign that halted a @entity11 - led campaign against @entity1 's ethnic @entity30 majority			1
thousands of people swarmed @entity0 's streets ahead of sunday 's parliamentary declaration , singing , dancing and holding signs in freezing wind after the vote was announced			1
but @entity39 consider the territory the cradle of their civilization , and protesters clashed with police outside the @entity45 in @entity46 as the declaration was issued			2
@entity11 said it will not oppose independence with violence , but prime minister @entity50 said his country will never accept the establishment of a " false country " on its territory			1
" anything and everything that we could n't achieve today will be obtained by new generations of @entity11 people in the future , " @entity50 said sunday in a televised address			1
" citizens of @entity11 , we have to come together and show the whole world that we do not acknowledge the creation of a false state in our territory			1
the violence that has been perpetrated upon @entity11 is very obvious			2
" about 100,000 @entity39 still live in @entity1 , making up about 5 percent of the population , and @entity50 said @entity39 have been killed or lost their land in the eight - plus years the country has been under international rule			2
but @entity72 , the nascent republic 's president , pledged to create a nation " where all citizens of all ethnicities feel appreciated			0
" " today is probably a day of trepidation for some of you , but your property and your rights will be respected in the future , " he said			0
former @entity85 gen. @entity84 , who led the @entity26 alliance during the 1999 conflict , said " there was no way beyond moving to this step			0
" but he urged the international community to work with @entity11 to keep the country moving toward integration with @entity94 and " to help them understand their situation			2
" " i 'm very sad that the @entity39 are unable to understand what 's happened , " @entity84 told @entity2			0
" but the magnitude of @entity11 repression of the @entity30 majority there and the violence that accompanied the ethnic cleansing in 1998 and 1999 was just so overwhelming that i think the @entity11 people have to understand that the @entity30 themselves have to have this separation			2
" @entity20 said @entity1 's declaration of independence " marks the end of the breakup of the former @entity108 , " which triggered years of bloodshed across the @entity111			2
former @entity108 president @entity112 launched a crackdown against ethnic @entity30 insurgents led by @entity20 in 1998 and refused to yield to @entity14 pressure to halt the campaign			0
when @entity26 responded by launching airstrikes against @entity11 and @entity119 , the last remaining @entity108 republics , @entity108 troops drove hundreds of thousands of @entity1 out of the region and killed thousands more			1
@entity112 died in 2005 while awaiting trial for war crimes before a @entity24 tribunal in the @entity125			0
the @entity126 and leading @entity94 nations , including @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , have supported @entity1 's move toward independence			1
but @entity15 , the @entity39 ' historical ally , has opposed independence , fearing it would incite other separatist movements in its backyard			1
the @entity136 held emergency talks on the issue sunday afternoon at @entity15 's request			2
@entity141 's @entity24 ambassador , @entity140 , told reporters that the declaration violates the @entity24 resolution that placed @entity1 under international administration at the end of the conflict			0
" our position is that this declaration should be disregarded by the international community , " as well as by the head of the @entity24 mission in @entity1 , @entity140 said			0
he said the council would meet again monday , with @entity11 president @entity154 expected to address the session			2
but no country supported the @entity15 call for the @entity24 to declare sunday 's declaration " null and void , " said sir @entity160 , the @entity129 ambassador to the world body			0
secretary - general ban ki - moon urged all parties " to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace , incite violence or jeopardize security in @entity1 and the region			0
" the @entity170 decided saturday to launch a mission of about 2,000 police and judicial officers to replace the @entity24 mission that has controlled the province since 1999			0
and @entity177 spokesman @entity176 said the @entity126 had " noted " that @entity1 had declared its independence and was reviewing the issue			1
earlier sunday , president @entity180 said @entity1 's status must be resolved before the @entity111 can become stable			0
" we are heartened by the fact that the @entity1 government has clearly proclaimed its willingness and its desire to support @entity11 rights in @entity1 , " @entity180 told reporters in @entity183 , @entity184			1
the @entity126 and many of its @entity94 allies support a plan negotiated by former @entity194 president @entity193 that would give @entity1 limited statehood under international supervision			1
but @entity15 , which has fought two wars against separatist rebels in its southwestern republic of @entity200 , said @entity126 and @entity94 support for @entity1 's independence could lead to an " uncontrollable crisis " in the @entity111			1
in a statement , @entity170 foreign policy chief @entity204 urged " everybody to act calmly and in a responsible way			0
i am convinced that the @entity1 leaders will be up to their responsibilities in this crucial moment			0
" @entity204 said @entity170 foreign ministers would meet monday to consider the issue			0
