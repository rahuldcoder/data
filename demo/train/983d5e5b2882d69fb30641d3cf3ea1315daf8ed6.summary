@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 soldiers interrogated by the @entity6 in the 2007 murders of four @entity9 detainees blamed a military policy they said made it too hard to detain suspected insurgents , a @entity2 investigation has found			1
soldiers questioned in the killings said the sergeant in command of their detachment ordered the suspected insurgents killed because @entity6 rules made it too difficult to hold them			1
" they 're gon na be right back on the streets , " one soldier put it			2
@entity2 obtained an extraordinary 23½ hours of @entity6 interrogation videotapes that detail the march 2007 executions of the prisoners by three sergeants who were attached to @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29			1
the tapes show one of the sergeants confessing to the crime , as well as agents from the @entity6 's @entity35 telling soldiers involved in the crime that the military 's reputation was at stake			1
on one tape , an @entity6 interrogator compares the potential fallout from the slayings to the scandal over the treatment of inmates at @entity9 's @entity49 prison , telling a soldier , " this is gon na be ugly , ' cause it is			1
" " just like them knuckleheads who were stacking naked prisoners in the pyramids at @entity49 , " the interrogator says			2
" we walk down the streets , and that 's a shame we all carry			2
and i had nothing to do with that			2
" i do n't know about you , but i was n't at @entity49 , but i can tell you half the time i 'm walking down the streets , that 's what people think when they 're lookin ' at us : ' oh , there 's those damn @entity5 that abused those poor prisoners			2
' " he added , " frat boys get abused worse during pledge week in college than that crap			2
but it 's what the media made of it			2
what the hell do you think they 're gon na make of this ? " the soldiers , who were based in @entity88 , @entity1 , were videotaped in january 2008 during the @entity6 's investigation into what happened at a @entity92 canal the previous march			1
on the tapes , soldiers blamed the @entity6 's policy of detaining prisoners for the frustration that led to the shootings			1
by all accounts , the incident began after soldiers from the company were fired upon			0
the soldiers went to a house where they found four @entity9 men and a small weapons cache			1
the men were loaded into the back of a @entity110 fighting vehicle			0
but instead of being taken to the detainee housing area , they were driven in a convoy of 13 soldiers to the canal and killed , according to trial testimony and other documents in the case			0
@entity119 , who has since left the @entity6 because of a serious injury , recalled a conversation he had with 1st sgt. @entity122 , who was in charge that day			1
" my first sergeant comes up to me , and pulls me away from everybody , then he asked me if we take them to the detainee facility , the ' @entity130 , ' that they 're gon na be right back on the streets doing the same thing in a matter of weeks , " @entity119 told @entity2			1
" he asked me if i had a problem if we take care of them , and i told him no. " @entity119 and other soldiers interviewed by @entity2 said @entity122 was frustrated by the @entity6 's rules for evidence required to hold @entity9 detainees			1
@entity119 was not charged and received immunity for his testimony			0
the three sergeants who killed the detainees were convicted of premeditated murder and conspiracy in a military courtroom in @entity1 earlier this year			2
all three are serving their sentences at the @entity5 military prison at @entity153 , @entity154			0
@entity122 received a life sentence that was later reduced to 40 years ; sgt. 1st class @entity156 , who had pleaded guilty to the charges , and sgt. @entity159 , a medic , are serving 20 - year terms			0
@entity122 and @entity159 are appealing their convictions , while @entity156 is seeking a lighter sentence			0
@entity122 and @entity159 were found not guilty of killing an injured @entity9 in a prior incident			1
@entity2 obtained the 23½ hours of interrogation videos , which include @entity159 's confession			1
the @entity6 , citing an ongoing investigation , refused to release the @entity159 tapes after @entity2 requested them under the @entity169			1
however , @entity2 obtained those tapes and others in which other soldiers who were at the canal were also questioned about their knowledge of what happened			1
on the tapes , @entity159 is asked by an @entity6 interrogator where he shot the @entity9 detainee			1
" it was in the back of the head , " @entity159 said			0
" i guess in the back of the head			0
" @entity159 admits he fired two shots , but killed only one detainee			0
the interrogators press him about who killed the fourth @entity9			1
" like , my arm went up to the right , and i fired again			0
i 'm pretty sure i did n't hit anybody , but i 'm not gon na say that because i do n't know for sure			0
i was n't even looking when i shot the second time			0
my arm just went to the right			0
" @entity159 finally admits on the tape that his bullet struck the second detainee , but said @entity122 fired two more shots that killed the man			0
besides @entity122 , @entity159 and @entity156 , two other soldiers received prison sentences but have since been released			0
the other soldiers at the canal that day were not charged , and received immunity for testifying			0
the tapes , and the investigative case file obtained by @entity2 , reveal how the soldiers believed the policy for taking in and holding detainees was not working , and was the reason for the murders			1
" seems like , even if you do your job and take these guys to the detainee center , they just come right back , " @entity159 said on tape			0
" the same [ expletive ] guys shooting at you			0
" @entity2 obtained a copy of a january 9 , 2005 , memo , marked " draft , " that imposed detailed standards for evidence soldiers needed before taking in suspected insurgents in @entity9			1
the memo was written by maj. gen. @entity225 , who oversaw detainee operations at the time			0
" failure to follow these regulations may result in acquittal or premature release of detainees , " the memo states			0
gen. @entity233 , who now holds that position , told @entity2 the rules specified in the memo were in effect through the end of 2008			1
" before the memo was written , a person could just bring a detainee to our facility , " @entity233 told @entity2			1
" we could take them in with little or nothing			0
" the memo states that " circumstances permitting , " evidence of criminal activity should include " photographs of the physical evidence , " " photographs of the detainee at the crime scene or place of capture , " as well as " photographs of the detainee next to the evidence			2
" other evidence should include a sketch of the crime scene , all physical evidence of the crime , and " statements written by first - hand witnesses to the criminal activity			2
" sgt. @entity264 , who was at the canal but not charged , said on one of the interrogation tapes that getting two statements from @entity9 witnesses was nearly impossible			1
" it 's pretty hard to get somebody to give us a sworn statement unless they 're pretty bad guys			0
so what we normally do is we pick them up , drive them around a little bit to scare them and then drop them off somewhere , " @entity264 said			0
@entity233 said @entity9 witnesses were preferred , but not required			1
in documents obtained by @entity2 , an army intelligence officer attached to @entity27 said " statements from @entity5 service members were not accepted as proof of insurgent activity " and that the detention facility " required at least two witness statements from @entity9			1
" @entity289 , @entity159 's attorney , told @entity2 that soldiers are not trained to be police officers who collect evidence			1
" as it was , they had to take off their soldier helmet , put on their cop hat , take them to a civilian sort of police station and show evidence that these were people that were shooting at them and if there was n't enough evidence then they were gon na be released on the street , " @entity289 said			2
" but soldiers are n't trained to be cops , and they 're not trained to collect evidence and they 're not trained in the ways of civilian criminal prosecutions			0
" @entity122 did not testify at his trial			0
but in a letter from prison to @entity2 , @entity122 wrote " the guidelines established for detaining and prosecuting the enemy has extensive flaws			1
furthermore , the enemy is well aware of these flaws and consistently exploits these to facilitate their release			0
" i challenge you to imagine the frustration felt after being engaged in firefights for several hours with the enemy and capture them only to have them released 2 - 3 days later because you 're being told the holding area needs more information on them , " he wrote			2
according to the @entity5 military , 76,985 detainees have been released out of the 87,011 captured during the @entity9 war			1
" we 've repeatedly found ourselves fighting the same enemy again and again , " @entity122 wrote			0
