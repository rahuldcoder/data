-- to project elections , @entity0 and its election experts use scientific statistical procedures to make estimates of the final vote count in each race			1
@entity0 will broadcast a projected winner only after an extensive review of data from a number of sources			1
@entity0 editorial policy strictly prohibits reporting winners or characterizing the outcome of a statewide contest in any state before all the polls are scheduled to close in every precinct in that state			1
@entity0 will receive information from the following sources : the @entity22 : the @entity22 will provide vote totals for each race			1
the @entity22 will be gathering numbers via stringers based in each county or other jurisdiction where votes are tabulated			1
@entity30 : to assist @entity0 in collecting and evaluating this information , @entity0 , the other television networks and the @entity22 have employed @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
in previous elections , this firm has assisted @entity0 in projecting winners in state and national races			1
@entity30 will conduct exit polls , which ask voters their opinion on a variety of relevant issues , determine how they voted , and ask a number of demographic questions to allow analysis of voting patterns by group			1
using exit poll results , scientifically selected representative precincts , vote results from the @entity22 , and a number of sophisticated analysis techniques , @entity30 also recommends projections of a winner for each race it covers			1
collecting data the process of projecting races begins by creating a sample of precincts			1
the precincts are selected by random chance , like a lottery , and every precinct in the state has an equal chance to be in the sample			1
they are not bellwether precincts or " key " precincts			0
each one does not mirror the vote in a state but the sample collectively does			0
the first indication of the vote comes from the exit polls conducted by @entity30			1
on the day of the election , @entity30 interviewers stand outside of precincts in a given state			1
they count the people coming out after they have voted and are instructed to interview every third person or every fifth person , for example , throughout the voting day			0
the rate of selection depends on the number of voters expected at the polling place that day			0
they do this from the time the polling place opens until shortly before it closes			0
the interviewers give each selected voter a questionnaire , which takes only a minute or two to complete			0
it asks about issues that are important , and background characteristics of the voter , and it also asks for whom they voted in the most important races			0
during the day , the interviewer phones the information from the questionnaires to a computer center			0
next , vote totals come in from many of the same sample precincts as the exit polls after the voting has finished in those precincts			1
these are actual votes that are counted after the polls have closed			0
election officials post the results so anyone at the precinct can know them			0
the third set of vote returns come from the vote tallies done by local officials			0
the local figures become more complete as more precincts report vote returns			0
the county or township vote is put into statistical models , and @entity30 makes estimates and projections using those models			2
in addition , @entity0 will be monitoring the web sites of the @entity136 offices to help analyze the outcome of early voting and absentee voting			2
projections the projections for @entity0 will be made from the @entity142 at the @entity143			2
an independent team of political analysts and statistical experts will analyze the data that will lead to the final decisions on projections			0
@entity0 will decide when and how to make a projection for a race depending on how close the race is			2
in races that do not appear to be very close , projections may be made at poll closing time based entirely on exit poll results , which are the only information available when the polls close about how people voted			0
the races projected from exit polls alone are races with comfortable margins between the top two candidates			0
projections from exit polls also take into account the consistency between exit poll results and pre-election polls			0
in the case of close races , @entity0 will wait for actual votes to be tabulated and reported			1
@entity30 may make projection recommendations to its clients , but @entity0 will make all final calls for broadcast			1
shortly after poll closing time , @entity0 may make projections using models that combine exit polls and actual votes			2
this happens in closer races			0
for extremely close races , @entity0 will rely on actual votes collected at the local level			1
these are the races that can not be projected when the polls close from exit polls or even from actual votes collected at the sample precincts mentioned earlier			1
the projection for these races will be based on a statistical model that uses the actual votes			0
if it is too close for this model to provide a reliable projection , @entity0 will wait for election officials to tally all or almost all the entire vote			2
what a projection call means @entity0 analysts will make all projections for @entity0 broadcasts			2
when @entity0 's analysts project a winner in a race , whether it is based upon data from @entity30 or from the @entity0 computations , it means that when all the votes are counted , @entity0 projects that the candidate will win the race			1
a projection is as close to statistical certainty as possible , but that does not mean that a mistake can not happen ; rather , it means that every precaution has been taken to see that a mistake is not made			0
@entity0 will not " declare " someone a winner because that declaration is up to election officials			2
@entity0 will make projections based on our best estimate of how @entity0 expects an election to turn out			2
when a lot of vote returns have been tallied , a race may be referred as " too close to call " by @entity0 anchors and analysts			2
" too close to call " means the final result will be very close and that the @entity0 analysts may not know who won			0
for the races that are the closest , the @entity236 will keep @entity0 viewers up to date on the state - by - state rules regarding automatic recounts and will report immediately on any official candidate challenge regarding the results or voting irregularities .			1

@entity0 receives data from @entity22 , @entity30
process of projecting races begins by creating a sample of precincts
