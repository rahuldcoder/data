@entity0 , @entity1 -- modern - day pilgrims to @entity0 have much curiosity about life in the re-creation of an @entity8 village from the 1600s and a @entity11 homesite			2
but some of the thousands of people who visit daily to get a glimpse of how the first colonials existed and created the @entity17 tradition bring with them misconceptions about the native people			1
@entity20 , left , and @entity21 take a gentle approach to correct visitors to the homesite			1
@entity21 , of the @entity25 , said one of the first things she learned when she started working at @entity28 in @entity1 30 years ago was : " people will say things that will hurt you			2
" a parent might reprimand their children by saying , " if you do n't behave i am going to leave you with this @entity37 squaw and she will cook you for dinner , " @entity21 said			2
officials who run the site say they have tried to educate visitors by putting up signs asking them to avoid stereotypes and showing a short film at the beginning of the tour explaining what really happened when the @entity49 first arrived in @entity28			1
still , " people take a lot of liberties with native people , " @entity21 said			1
some have even told her : " i thought we killed all of you			2
" @entity20 has heard that too			2
she has been an educator and interpreter at @entity28 since the 1970s			0
she says sometimes the ignorance can be fairly benign , such as when a visitor looks at @entity62 food and asks , " you 're not going to eat that are you ? " but at other times , the misconceptions can be offensive			1
an adult chaperone recently asked a @entity68 , @entity69 , " where do you get your alcohol ? " @entity69 told the visitor that his comment was inappropriate and then walked away -- which is what @entity75 trains her staff to do			1
" we try to help people understand how offensive that statement is , and then replace it with truthful information , " @entity75 said			0
@entity21 likes to quote another @entity11 , @entity84 , a @entity85 , who says " ignorance is like a stone wall			0
if you try to fight it , you will end up with bloody fists			0
instead you must take down each stone , gently , one at a time			0
" so when a child is war - whooping and the parent says " stop acting like a wild @entity37 , " @entity21 said you have to " carefully dismantle the myth			0
it 's a delicate procedure			1
" the gentle approach appears to be working			0
@entity100 from @entity101 , @entity1 , who makes the 100 - mile trek to @entity28 every year at @entity17 to remind herself and her family where it all started , said her family " has learned to be more sensitive to the @entity62 culture			1
" @entity21 agreed that many visitors do seem to get the message			1
" in a great many cases we do take a stone off the wall and sometimes you even see a light on the other side			0
" the best progress is made with schoolchildren who have not been tainted by inaccurate history lessons or so many old cowboy and @entity37 movies , @entity21 said			0
and @entity28 , with its homesite staffed by @entity124 , is a great place for teaching , @entity21 said			0
" we have a unique opportunity here because of our history to teach them about our culture and dispel the myths			1
