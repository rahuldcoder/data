@entity0 -- the @entity2 is ready			0
the new pope 's clothes are laid out			2
now it 's up to the cardinals			1
the work to elect a successor to retired pope @entity9 begins in earnest tuesday , with a morning @entity10 at @entity11			1
the service -- open to the public -- will be the last public event featuring the 115 cardinals who will choose the new spiritual leader of the world 's 1.2 billion @entity17			1
@entity19 taking part in the process will then walk to the @entity2 , chanting prayers as they go , to begin the secret election called the conclave			1
after that , the only clue the world will have of what is happening inside will be periodic puffs of smoke from a copper chimney installed over the weekend in the @entity2			0
black smoke , no pope			0
@entity0 was abuzz monday with preparations for the conclave , from the 5,600 journalists the @entity40 said had been accredited to cover the event to the red curtains unfurled from the central balcony at @entity11 , the spot where the world will meet the new pope once he is elected			1
tailors have also completed sets of clothes for the new pope to wear as soon as he is elected			0
video released by the @entity40 over the weekend showed the installation of a pair of stoves inside the chapel			1
one is used to burn the cardinals ' ballots after they are cast and the other to send up the smoke signal -- the one that alerts the world that a vote has been taken and whether there 's a new pope			1
workers could be seen scaling the roof of the chapel saturday to install the chimneys that will carry the smoke signals to the world			0
when we 'll see the first smoke is anyone 's guess			2
the cardinals will probably vote tuesday , but they do n't have to , @entity40 spokesman the rev. @entity74 said monday			1
if they do , it 's likely the first smoke might be seen around 8 p.m. ( 3 p.m. et ) , he said			2
when cardinals elected @entity9 in 2005 , the white smoke signaling the decision came about six hours after an earlier , inconclusive vote , he said			1
it took another 50 minutes for @entity9 to dress , pray and finally appear on the balcony of @entity11 , he said			0
the longest conclave held since the turn of the 20th century lasted five days			1
on monday , cardinals held the last of several days of meetings to discuss church affairs and get acquainted			1
@entity74 said 152 cardinals were on hand for the final meeting			2
church rules prevent cardinals over the age of 80 from participating in the election of a pope but allow them to attend the " @entity98 " that precede the vote			1
on friday , cardinal @entity100 of @entity101 , one of about a dozen leading candidates to become pope , said the meetings have focused less on scandals facing the church and more on spiritual matters			0
" we cardinals sure are praying a lot , " @entity100 wrote			2
contrary to media reports , he wrote in a blog post , the focus of the cardinals ' meetings is much the same as it was two millenniums ago , namely : " how most effectively to present the person , message , and invitation of @entity120 to a world that , while searching for salvation and eternal truth , are also at times doubting , skeptical , too busy , or frustrated			2
" he said , " those are the ' big issues			0
' you may find that hard to believe , since the ' word on the street ' is that all we talk about is corruption in the @entity132 , sexual abuse , money			0
do these topics come up ? yes ! do they dominate ? no ! " the scandals came up again monday when the @entity138 denied conclave accreditation to @entity141 journalist @entity140 , who wrote a book about scandals within the @entity40			1
the book was based partly on documents leaked from @entity9 's personal apartments			2
@entity40 spokesman the rev. @entity74 told @entity1 the accreditation had been denied because @entity140 applied as a documentary filmmaker , not as a journalist			1
meanwhile , the @entity141 press is full of speculation about which cardinal may win enough support from his counterparts to be elected , and what regional alliances are being formed			0
the @entity156 has 11 of the 115 votes , making it the second largest national bloc after @entity141			0
sixty of the cardinals are from @entity160 and 67 were appointed by @entity9 , who stepped down at the end of last month , becoming the first pontiff to do so in six centuries			0
@entity1 's @entity164 and @entity165 reported from @entity0 , and @entity166 wrote in @entity167			0
@entity1 's @entity168 and @entity169 and journalist @entity170 also contributed to this report .			0

tuesday 's *pre-conclave* @entity10 will be open to the public , the @entity40 says
cardinals do not have to vote tuesday but probably will , a @entity40 spokesman says
preparations are largely complete for the secret vote
the longest conclave in the 20th century lasted five days
