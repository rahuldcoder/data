-- you know the drill			2
pony up a little ( or a lot ) more scratch at @entity7 's top theme parks , sports stadiums , wildlife sanctuaries , lounges and museums and you can expect a different deal			1
but where and when does it pay to go @entity18 ? you should always take those three letters with a grain of salt , but sometimes they really do sweeten the pot , provide a once - in - a - lifetime experience or just save your sanity			2
here are 12 vip options in nine categories that are worth the extra cash			1
theme parks if money was no object , who would n't do the whole destination amusement park thing differently ? as in , no lines anywhere , front row seating everywhere and a personal park operative to maneuver you through the madness			1
the @entity38 ( from $ 315 per hour ) is about as close to that parallel universe as it gets in the @entity40 , @entity41 and beyond			2
the package includes a door - to - door resort guide overseeing your own personally customized , multipark itinerary -- with all the line - skipping , special - seating and headache - saving that groups of up to 10 can pack into six hours			0
the @entity49 ( from $ 199 ) also offers fully customized tours for private groups , assigning a hands - on guide to keep you oriented and on - task with preferred everything from parking to show and restaurant seating to front - of - line privileges on most rides			0
@entity60 unless you 're about to be tackled by security at midfield , stepping onto the actual turf at one of the world 's most venerable sports venues is strictly reserved for pro athletes and umps , right ? not if you book the @entity69 ( from $ 25,000 ) for a private vip event			1
then the hallowed home of the @entity72 , the nation 's second - oldest ballpark , is yours for the experiencing at home - plate level			1
customized events let you tour " the @entity81 , " play ball right on the field with accompanying scoreboard and sound system , and even take batting practice with legends of the game			1
will they play the @entity88 song for you ? you bet			0
wildlife not that jockeying for position to glimpse gorillas among the weekend zoo crowd is n't a privilege in its own right			0
it might even inspire some comparisons with the guy standing beside you			0
just know that there are premium animal encounters to be had at some of @entity7 's most popular wildlife parks and attractions from coast to coast			1
left @entity105 : @entity107 's @entity106 ( from $ 599 ) provides a customized , intimate journey through one of the world 's most famous zoos			1
the tour includes up - close animal encounters , a special lunch and access to off - exhibit areas tailored to your zoological hankerings			1
@entity105 : @entity120 's @entity119 ( from $ 299 ) lets guests dodge crowds for intimate feeding sessions with dolphins , sea lions and stingrays -- plus jump to the front of every ride line and enjoy reserved seating at live shows -- before their own feeding at @entity132			1
@entity133 @entity133 studios have been inviting folks for behind - the - scenes peeks since the silent era , when @entity139 boss @entity138 came up with the idea of selling bleacher seats during shoots for 25 cents a pop. while the standard 45 - minute @entity148 is more or less a warmup for the theme park , the @entity144 ( $ 299 ) at the world 's largest movie and tv studio includes a personal park guide , vip meal service , hours of front - of - line ride benefits and back - lot access to otherwise off - limits sound stages , props warehouses , costume departments and all those immortal exterior sets from your favorite old @entity160 and @entity162 flicks			1
@entity164 is home of " @entity166 , " " @entity167 , " " @entity168 " and the @entity169 ( $ 52 ) , which whisks guests for more than two hours around the 100 - acre lot of @entity133 's oldest studio			1
no two tours are the same here , because this is workingman 's @entity133			1
you 're seeing life on the lot as it plays out during the week without the aid of a theme park ride : through props departments , craft shops , sets of hit tv series and sound stages			1
museum you love the @entity188 of @entity190 's great @entity189 , the @entity191 and space section covering the universe 's 13 - billion - year history and those fascinating human origins dioramas			2
but you 'd love it even more without all those other humans milling around			0
take it from @entity199 and @entity200 ... er , @entity201 -- @entity203 's natural history museum is an entirely different place outside regular public hours			2
while the @entity206 's @entity38 ( $ 500 for a group of up to five ) ca n't guarantee you 'll befriend @entity208 or a @entity209 that fetches rib bones ( that stuff only happens after sundown ) , the facility 's premier private tour ( 9 - 10 a.m. , before doors officially open ) walks you through the place like it 's your own			1
then , when all the regular guests arrive , you get pre-seating at the @entity219 , @entity221 viewing and access to special exhibits			0
tough to come up with a sequel as good as that			0
live music snagging any old seat to hear the @entity228 crank out " @entity236 " for the millionth time or watch @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity234 strut on stage ( no , not all together ) means a call to @entity238			0
sitting front row at any of these upcoming summer concert tours , attending a pre-show party and doing a meet - and - greet photo op with some of these stars means a trip to @entity245			1
the preferred concert seating company , specializing in premium vip packages and rare access to your favorite musical artists , can probably help you get that special moment with @entity254 you 've been waiting for all these years			1
dining you can get the " private room " vip treatment with great city views at any lofty restaurant worth its @entity262 salt - crusted sea bass			2
but for the real gravity - defying haute dining experience you have to lose the walls , the floor and the windows and do @entity268 in the @entity269 -- a singular multicourse dining adventure that seats you and your closest 21 vip friends or business associates at a table suspended up to 18 stories high by a specialized crane and equipment			2
developed by @entity279 - based events in the @entity269 , the @entity7 - authorized experience can be set up in virtually any 100 - foot by 50 - foot space accessible by a large truck			0
still miss the @entity282 ? tennis can you believe it ? the @entity285 is just two months away and the @entity286 is in less than half a year ! welcome to the sports doldrums of late august and early september			0
is there a classic @entity7 sporting event happening somewhere at this time worth dropping a bundle on to experience in the most pampered manner possible ? yes			0
in @entity295 , @entity203 , home of tennis ' @entity296			0
there are four basic ways to experience the greatest @entity301 tournament ( if you 're not @entity303 , @entity304 or @entity305 ) in racquet sports			0
in your living room , on @entity309 3			0
in the nosebleeds watching @entity311 -- or is that @entity312 ? 4			0
with a @entity7 @entity313 ( from $ 700 up to $ 1,850 ) , which includes vip parking , loge level seating , breakfast in the @entity317 , exclusive dining access and a $ 200 @entity319 for each guest			2
do any -- or all -- of these syllables spell a brilliant time in @entity329 to you ? if so , the @entity331 ( $ 149.99 ) might just make it even smarter -- allowing you to cut through long lines , escape crazy cover charges and score two - for - one drinks at some of the most happening venues all over the @entity338			0
introduced last year on the heels of @entity18 - for - a - weekend " club crawl " services , the @entity331 lets frequent @entity329 visitors check off 40 - plus ultra lounges , nightclubs and all - hours pool parties over the course of several visits			2
or one really crazy weekend .			0

want to meet @entity254 ? @entity245 might be able to help you out
the @entity69 lets you take batting practice with legends of the game
@entity206 's vip tour lets you avoid crowds
@entity358 gives you a new perspective on the park
