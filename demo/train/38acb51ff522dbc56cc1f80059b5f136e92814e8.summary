man @entity11 , an @entity12 - born refugee who was granted political asylum in @entity10 in 2001 , had " a long history of violent crime , infatuation with extremism and mental instability , " @entity10 prime minister @entity9 told reporters			1
" it 's pretty obvious that the perpetrator was a deeply disturbed individual , " he said at a press conference tuesday , adding that the 50 - year - old was " well known " to federal and state police , as well as the @entity23			2
" but i do n't believe he was on a terror watch list at this time			0
" @entity29 premier @entity28 said authorities were investigating why @entity11 -- who was killed in the siege -- was at large , given his criminal background			1
" we 're all outraged that this guy was on the street , " he told reporters			0
" we need to understand why he was			0
we also need to understand why he was n't picked up			0
" what we know , what we do n't know accessory to murder , sex charges the self - styled @entity43 cleric , also known as @entity44 , was facing dozens of charges at the time of the siege , including two counts of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife , according to the attorney general of @entity29			1
@entity55 was found dead with multiple stab wounds in a stairwell , and her body had been set on fire , the @entity54 reported			0
" they should have put him away and thrown away the key , " the dead woman 's godfather , @entity60 , told @entity62			0
he said @entity11 used to beat @entity66 , forcing her to wear a hijab all the time and forbidding her from talking to " outsiders			1
" court documents show @entity11 was also facing 45 sex - related charges , including sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated indecent assault			1
according to the @entity54 , the initial charges , laid in may 2014 , related to an alleged sexual assault on a woman in western @entity3 in 2002 , before other sex - related charges were added regarding six additional victims			2
@entity11 was using the name @entity83 -- his birth name , according to @entity86 's state news agency @entity85 -- and claimed to be a " healer , " according to the report			1
@entity11 also pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive " poison pen " letters to the families of @entity10 soldiers who died in @entity93 , and was sentenced to 300 hours of community service			1
the letters were " sadistic , wantonly cruel and deeply wounding , " one high court judge said at the time , according to @entity97 affiliate @entity96			0
but the criminal accusations against him began even before he came to @entity10			2
@entity11 fled his homeland in 1995 while being sought for allegedly committing fraud , @entity86 's semi-official @entity100 reported			2

@entity11 had been granted political asylum in 2001 and had had no further contact with his birth country , the spokesperson said			1
who were the victims ? an extremist theology @entity115 , a lawyer who acted for @entity11 in relation to the accessory to murder and letter - writing charges , told @entity97 his former client had been a cleric in @entity86 , but had become critical of the @entity121 's government in the late 1990s , and fled to @entity10 " because he was going to be killed			1
" he had left behind a wife and two children , who he believed @entity11 had not seen since			2
throughout the 2000s , said @entity115 , @entity11 " became sympathetic to what he perceived ... was the victimization of @entity43 and @entity126 around the world , and partly at least took up that cause			1
" his broader cause , he said , was lobbying governments around the world , particularly @entity10 , not to wage wars on @entity43 soil			1
" he was so blinded by that objective that it would seem he had lost sight of objectivity and rationality and acted in extreme ways , " he said , describing his former client as " intensely conflicted and contradicted and inconsistent			0
" while older footage of @entity146 preaching shows him dressed in typical @entity149 cleric 's attire , in his social media posts , he appears to embrace a radical @entity152 extremist theology			2
he used the @entity153 to spread extremist beliefs , garnering nearly 13,000 likes on his @entity157 page			0
during the siege , @entity9 said , the hostage - taker " sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ( @entity161 ) death cult , " @entity9 said			1
on his website , which has now been taken down , there was a pledge of allegiance to the so - called islamic state terror group			1
the site describes @entity11 as a @entity43 cleric and activist based in @entity3 who has " continuously been under attack & false accusation by the @entity10 government & media since he started his political letter campaign from 2007			1
" there 's a graphic photo of slain children at the top of the site			0
under the image , it reads , " this is an evidence for the terrorism of @entity188 and its allies including @entity10			2
the result of their airstrikes			0
" a description on the site portrayed @entity11 as a victim of a political vendetta and compares him to @entity197 , the @entity198 founder who has claimed the sex crime allegations he faces are politically motivated			1
a @entity201 video posted in november shows @entity11 standing on a street corner , chains draped over him , carrying a sign that says , " i have been tortured in prison for my political letters			1
" police have refused to comment on that accusation			0
his last tweet linked to his website , with a haunting message posted the day of his attack on the @entity3 cafe : " if we stay silent towards the criminals we can not have a peaceful society			2
the more you fight with crime , the more peaceful you are			0
" @entity115 told @entity10 public broadcaster @entity220 that @entity11 was an isolated figure who was probably acting alone			1
crisis in a cafe monday 's hostage situation began around 10 a.m. hundreds of police officers , including snipers , took position around the @entity229 in @entity3 's central business district			0
@entity10 media captured haunting images of hostages pressing their hands against the cafe 's windows			2
they were reportedly taking turns holding a black flag with @entity241 writing on it that said , " there is no @entity244 but @entity245 and @entity246 is the prophet of @entity245			0
