-- @entity3 's @entity2 title defense came to a shock end on monday as the @entity6 tennis star followed world no. 1 @entity7 in exiting the clay - court grand slam			1
with second - ranked @entity12 struggling into the quarterfinals with a labored victory , the way is open for the lesser lights of the women 's game to make a name for themselves			1
@entity3 had been hoping to become the first player since @entity24 in 2007 to successfully defend her title , but the world @entity26 lost 3 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 0 to @entity22 qualifier @entity20 -- ranked 135 places below her			1
" i lost one match so do n't try to put me down , " she said angrily at the post-match press conference			0
" i will try to find the reason why i lost			0
i will take some days off to totally forget tennis , then try to come back next week			0
i need some time to recover , i 'm not a machine			0
" @entity12 also battled with the cold , windy conditions at @entity2 as her serve fell apart and she made a series of unforced errors before finally beating unseeded @entity39 @entity38 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 6 - 2			1
the @entity40 is seeking to win the tournament for the first time , having reached the semifinals last year and in 2007 , and she will displace @entity7 at the top of the rankings if she makes it to the title match			1
she has not won a grand slam since 2008 , when she added the @entity49 to her @entity51 and @entity52 crowns			0
the 25 - year - old has resurrected her career after longterm shoulder problems , but major doubts remain about the consistency and strength of her serve -- which let her down in last year 's @entity52 final defeat by @entity60 and again in the title match against @entity7 in @entity62 in january			1
the match with @entity38 featured an incredible 21 breaks of service as @entity12 delivered 12 double - faults to her opponent 's seven and 53 unforced errors to the 30 - year - old 's 48			2
" the conditions were difficult today , but it was a good test , " said @entity12 , who lost only five games in her previous three matches			0
" i had the chance to finish it in two			0
i came out strong in the third set and it 's nice to be in the quarters again			0
" @entity12 will next face @entity79 23rd seed @entity78 , who upset former world no. 1 @entity80 in round three and then beat unseeded @entity83 @entity82 on monday			1
@entity78 won 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 0 against the 21 - year - old conqueror of @entity86 's no. 25 @entity85 to match her 2008 effort of reaching the quarters			2
@entity20 's reward for toppling @entity3 is a clash with @entity39 fourth seed @entity60 , who thrashed @entity94 - born @entity93 @entity92 6 - 2 6 - 1 to reach the event 's last eight for the first time			1
the 24 - year - old @entity20 also reached quarterfinals in @entity99 in 2010 , when she won grand slam doubles titles at @entity52 and the @entity51			1
however , she was a first - round loser here last year and then at @entity52 and missed the other two majors as she struggled with injuries			0
after @entity12 and @entity60 , the highest - ranked player remaining in the last eight is @entity51 champion @entity106			2
the sixth - seeded @entity107 , who was runner - up in @entity99 in 2010 , will next face @entity7 's conqueror @entity109			2
tuesday 's other quarterfinal will be between @entity86 10th seed @entity111 and @entity114 's no. 21 @entity113 .			0

@entity2 champion @entity3 loses to world no. *142* in the fourth round
@entity22 qualifier @entity20 moves into the quarterfinals in @entity99
world no. 2 @entity12 battles into the last eight with three - set win
