a week after the mayor of @entity3 , @entity4 , was incarcerated by the @entity7 government , his youngest daughter is speaking out and demanding his release			1
the last time @entity10 , 23 , saw her father was in early january when she left @entity11 bound for @entity12			1
at the time , her teary - eyed dad embraced her and asked , " when will i see you again ? promise me you will take care of yourself , " she wrote in an open letter published earlier this week			0
@entity4 says she never imagined that in just a few weeks seeing her father again would become a matter of not " when " but " if			1
" " he was unjustly imprisoned and has effectively been kidnapped by this government , " said @entity4 , who was joined by a few dozen protesters monday night in @entity12 's @entity19			1
" the world needs to know what my country and what my family is going through , " she said			0
in the midst of a deepening economic crisis , the outspoken mayor of @entity11 's capital and largest city , is the latest in a growing list of opposition leaders who have been arrested and jailed by the country 's socialist government			1
on orders of president @entity39 , federal agents stormed into @entity4 's office on thurdsay , accusing him of conspiracy and helping to plot an @entity43 - backed coup			1
as the small crowd of protesters in @entity19 broke into chants of " @entity11 " and " this government will fall , " @entity4 vehemently denied the charges levied against her father			1
" my dad has been accused of conspiracy			2
he is a man who wants the freedom of my country			0
that is the only thing that he has done , " she said			0
" there is no explanation			0
my dad is the mayor of a city , and the government has not only disrespected him but all of his human rights			2
" @entity7 government officials in @entity12 did not respond to @entity5 's request for comment			1
although she has not been able to speak or see her father since his arrest , @entity4 believes that he remains in good spirits			2
" he 's trying to stay strong			2
he has an unbreakable spirit , and his only fear at this moment is losing the country that he loves			0
the government may have incarcerated his body but never his thoughts and ideas			0
" @entity4 's supporters fear that he will face the same fate as some of @entity11 's other dissident political prisoners , most notably , @entity78			1
@entity78 , a former mayoral and presidential candidate , has been in jail for over a year , accused of inciting violence during last year 's anti-government protests			2
" we know this could be a long process , but we are prepared for that			0
we will not let the abuses of this government weaken us , " said @entity4			1
" my father 's message from prison to @entity7 and the world is that our country is going through a horrible time , but we are a strong people and he is going to keep fighting			1
" @entity39 maintains that @entity78 , @entity4 and other opposition leaders were arrested by order of the attorney general 's office and must be tried for " crimes against the peace , security and constitution of the country			1
" critics , however , say that the government is systematically cracking down on the opposition to deflect attention from the flailing economy			0
since @entity39 took office , inflation is at an all - time high , 68 % , and falling oil prices have had a ripple effect on the country 's already ailing economy			0
the @entity113 predicts its economy will shrink by 7 % this year , the worst in @entity115			0
" it is a desperate act by a desperate regime that is seeking to veil the current social and political reality in @entity11 , " said @entity117 ambassador to the @entity118 , @entity116 , of @entity4 's arrest			1
@entity124 joined @entity4 's daughter at monday night 's rally			1
" to kidnap the mayor of @entity11 's capital , no less , is unprecedented , and it will have consequences , " said @entity116			2
in the meantime , @entity4 remains hopeful that she will once again be able to embrace her father as a free man			2
" @entity135 is the last thing you lose			0
i know my dad will be free			0
his cause is now my cause			0
" @entity11 arrests opposition figures : why you should care			0
