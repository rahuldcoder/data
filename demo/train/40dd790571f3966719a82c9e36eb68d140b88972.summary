@entity0 -- an oft - repeated statement that the @entity4 's partial shutdown has forced the layoff of 70,000 construction workers is , at best , an over-simplification , and at worst , an exaggeration , according to the expert behind the number			1
@entity12 leaders , and even some republicans , quoted the 70,000 number frequently this week to emphasize the serious consequences of the shutdown			2
but @entity18 professor @entity17 , whose 3 - year - old study was used by others to arrive at the 70,000 figure , said the estimate includes everything from actual construction workers , who were laid off , to drug store clerks and restaurant waitresses , who might see " a tiny bit less revenue flow			1
" the true number of laid - off construction workers is probably one - third of that figure , @entity17 told @entity1			1
the rampant use -- and misuse -- of the 70,000 figure is a study in the wondrous ways of @entity0 , where facts and figures frequently enter the public debate filled with nuance and caveats , all of which are rapidly abandoned in the blazing heat of partisan battle			2
the 70,000 figure entered the public sphere when the @entity4 turned to @entity47 general contractors of @entity48 , a construction industry group , to calculate the economic impact of the @entity4 funding impasse			1
the @entity4 had halted more than 200 construction projects totaling $ 2.5 billion			1
@entity53 dusted off the 3 - year - old study conducted by @entity17			0
his research , designed to show the " multiplier effect " of the president 's stimulus package , concluded in early 2009 that $ 1 billion in nonresidential construction created or supported 28,500 jobs and added $ 3.4 billion to the @entity62			2
an @entity53 economist applied @entity17 's formula to the @entity4 's $ 2.5 billion construction halt and came to the conclusion that it would put " 24,000 construction workers out of work			1
" another 11,000 workers in related businesses " are also affected , " the @entity53 said , and " as many as 35,000 jobs will be undermined in the broader economy , from the lunch wagon near the job site to the truck dealership across town			1
" the total number impacted -- in ways large and small -- was 70,000 , the @entity53 said			0
in a subsequent @entity81 news releases and statements , the information was abbreviated , losing much of its important nuance			0
" @entity53 estimates that 70,000 construction workers and workers in related fields have been affected , " the @entity81 reported in one news release			1
a @entity81 media advisory blurred the picture stating flatly " 70,000 construction workers and workers in related fields have been laid off			1
" the number lost even more clarity on monday , when transportation secretary @entity94 appeared at a news conference near one shutdown construction project			2
" seventy thousand construction workers are out of work today -- 70,000 ! -- and here we are right smack dab in the middle of the construction season in @entity48 , " @entity94 said			2
( in a slip of the tongue , @entity94 also misstated the purpose of the @entity107 airport project			0
" this tower needs to be built , " he said , gesturing towards a control tower that is being demolished			0
) others also cited the 70,000 figure			0
" more than 70,000 construction jobs around the country ... are on hold , " sen. @entity112 , @entity113 , said in a written statement			1
some apparently added the nearly 4,000 @entity4 employees who have been furloughed to the total			2
the dispute is " keeping 74,000 people from working , " @entity121 press secretary @entity120 said wednesday			0
" seventy - five thousand people are now over the precipice , " rep. @entity124 , @entity125 , said at a wednesday news conference			0
" we have 80,000 jobs at least on the line , " said majority leader @entity129 at one briefing tuesday			0
( president @entity134 , in comments wednesday , fudged , referring to " tens of thousands of construction workers being suspended ... " ) on wednesday , the @entity138 @entity137 got into the action			2
in a news release , it said @entity143 " jeopardized 90,000 airport construction jobs			1
" two sentences later , it went for the brass ring : " @entity147 must ( act ) to preserve almost 100,000 @entity48 jobs , " it said			0
@entity150 spokesman @entity149 , a former government spokesman , said he believes the politicians ' misstatements were innocent in nature			0
" i do n't have any impression that people are manipulating the numbers , but events are moving so fast that everyone needs to take a deep breath and make sure that we 're all working with the same data , " he said			0
" i think everyone 's frustrated that we 're in the predicament			0
" " i 'd just want to stress that we have been very careful to explain in all our communications that the 70,000 figure reflects the broader impact of halting airport construction jobs across the country , " @entity149 said			1
@entity17 , meanwhile , says the @entity4 should be able to release the actual number of laid off construction workers , making estimates unnecessary			1
the 70,000 number , while hard to wrap one 's head around , still might strike some at the @entity4 as questionably large			1
it is well above the total number of employees in the agency , which stands at about 47,500 .			0

@entity181 used the number to indicate " the broader impact of halting airport construction jobs "
the true number of laid - off workers is probably one - third of that figure , expert says
professor says the @entity4 should be able to release the actual number
