-- radio personality @entity1 declared himself bewildered by recent papal statements " about the utter evils of capitalism			1
" in his broadcast , titled " it 's @entity8 pope @entity8 ( unless it 's a @entity9 by @entity10 ) , " @entity1 said the remarks add up to " just pure @entity12 coming out of the mouth of the @entity8			1
" this would indeed be remarkable , if true			0
is it ? @entity1 is referring to the new apostolic exhortation , " @entity17 , " or " the @entity18 , " in which @entity19 lays out his vision for the church 's proclamation of the gospel			1
for @entity25 , enthusiastic about the @entity8 's unguarded style , the document offers a refreshing departure from the traditional voice : " there are @entity30 whose lives seem like @entity32 without @entity33 , " the @entity8 laments			1
" i want to remind priests that the confessional must not be a torture chamber			0
" he decries a kind of " spiritual worldliness " that " hides behind the appearance of piety , " warns against " sourpusses " who would substitute love of @entity44 with a love of the church , and rejects a defeatist " tomb psychology " that would transform @entity30 into " mummies in a museum			2
" and yet certainly the press has focused on those several pages -- in a document of 50,000 words -- that offer a vivid critique of the global economic system , what pope francis terms " an economy of exclusion and inequality			2
" here , @entity1 charges , " the @entity8 has now gone beyond @entity61 , and this is pure political			1
" more " saddened " than outraged , @entity1 states that " it is very clear ( the @entity8 ) does n't know what he 's talking about when it comes to capitalism and socialism , and so forth			1
" actually , the words " capitalism " and " socialism " do not appear in the document			0
but it is not difficult to discern the @entity8 's meaning : " just as the commandment ' thou shalt not kill ' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life , today we also have to say ' thou shalt not ' to an economy of exclusion and inequality			1
" as the first pope from the @entity92 , as one who experienced the financial meltdown of the @entity87 economy , as a bishop who encouraged his priests to work in the slums , @entity19 knows the global economy from the perspective of those at the bottom			1
decrying the idolatry of money , he sets himself firmly against a " deified marketplace " in which the masses of human beings become powerless spectators , if not disposable " leftovers			2
" @entity1 , who concedes that he is not catholic , though he says he 's " been tempted a number of times to delve into it , " nevertheless " knows enough to know that this would have been unthinkable for a pope to believe or say just a few years ago			1
" but little distinguishes pope @entity19 from the prophetic utterances of his predecessors			1
what he is offering is not " @entity12 , " as @entity1 says , but bedrock catholic social teaching that goes back more than a century			2
both pope @entity113 and @entity114 were explicit in their warnings against liberal capitalism and the dictatorship of the marketplace , producing encyclicals which , for their emphasis on social justice and the " option for the poor , " would surely qualify for @entity1 as the very elixir of " @entity12			1
" yet pope @entity19 may have touched a particular nerve			1
in the most often cited paragraph of his document , he notes , " some people continue to defend trickle - down theories which assume that economic growth , encouraged by a free market , will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world			0
" this opinion , which has never been confirmed by the facts , expresses a crude and @entity140 ve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system			0
meanwhile , the excluded are still waiting			0
" here , you might say he is getting personal , stepping beyond familiar pleas for the poor to confront a central article of faith among the elite beneficiaries of our economy : the notion that whatever benefits the wealthiest -- tax cuts or financial deregulation -- will inevitably benefit those at the bottom			2
apart from whether this is confirmed by the facts , @entity19 attacks the corrosive effects of such an ideology on our capacity for compassion and concern for others			1
" the culture of prosperity deadens us ; we are thrilled if the market offers us something new to purchase			0
in the meantime , all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle ; they fail to move us			0
" @entity1 finds this particular statement so bewildering that he repeats it three times			2
business commentators may rise to the defense of the marketplace			0
but pope @entity19 is not primarily interested in a debate about " wealth creation			1
" he stands in a tradition that goes back to the prophets of @entity189 , whose moral litmus test was the welfare of society 's least and most vulnerable members			0
pope @entity19 has taken it upon himself to speak for those who have no voice , to arouse the conscience of @entity30 , and to contribute to a culture of solidarity			1
he longs , he says , for a " church which is poor and for the poor			0
" perhaps what distinguishes him from his predecessors is simply that he has identified this as a central focus , and that he evidently intends to hold the church accountable to this mission			0
of course no one is troubled by a pope who embraces the sick and loves the poor			2
but when he dares to reflect on the moral and structural causes of poverty , that is a different matter			0
as @entity219 , another prophetic archbishop from @entity220 , famously observed , " when i give food to the poor they call me a saint			0
when i ask why they are poor , they call me a communist			0
" some things never change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity1 says pope @entity19 sounds @entity229 for his statements on poverty
@entity8 decries the idolatry of money , *extreme* materialism and disregard for poor
@entity1 says remarks " would have been unthinkable for a pope " to say few years ago
@entity227 : but concern for the poor above all is not @entity229 , it 's the core of @entity61
