@entity0 -- seldom does a daughter use such harsh words to describe her own father			1
@entity6 's daughter called him " the most evil , vile , demonic criminal " she ever heard of during a @entity1 exclusive interview thursday			1
" he is dead to me , " @entity9 said of the father police say kidnapped , held captive , raped and beat three young women in @entity0 for about a decade			1
she had known her " daddy " as a " friendly , caring , doting man			2
" now shocked and in disbelief , @entity15 says she never wants to see him again			2
" there will be no visits ; there will be no phone calls , " she said			2
" he can never be daddy again			2
i have no sympathy for the man			2
" as she mulled the accusations against him , she asked , " how could you ? " " i wonder this whole time , how he could be so good to us , but he ( allegedly ) took young women , little girls , someone else 's babies , away from these families and over the years never felt enough guilt to just give up and let them free			2
" @entity15 did not think anything out of the ordinary was going on in her childhood home			2
all that changed monday when @entity6 broke loose			1
police freed her fellow captives @entity6 and @entity6 , divulging the secret locked up inside the house at 2207 @entity47 snapshots : who are the three women freed in @entity0 ? when she first heard the news about their captivity , @entity15 said , she " just wanted to die			1
" she had known @entity55 and @entity56 from her school days			2
peculiarities she noticed about her father over the years started falling into place in a new , grim light , and they are making her feel " horrified , " she said			1
" this was going on right under my nose			2
" an odd place to visit when she came calling , " he would take forever to come to the door , " she said			1
he always had the house locked up tight			1
standing at a window , @entity6 would often give her a hand signal indicating to her to wait			1
then he 'd wave her around to the back door , not letting her in through the front of the house			1
once inside , visits were fun and cordial			0
@entity15 , her husband and @entity6 " ate , looked at photos and listened to music , " she said			1
" he appeared to be happy to see us and never rushed for us to leave			0
" at times , he would disappear from dinner and give no explanation for his absence			0
the music was usually turned up loud , but @entity15 thought this to be fitting since @entity6 was a musician			1
once she asked if she could go upstairs to see her childhood bedroom			1
@entity6 coaxed her out of the idea , telling her , " oh , honey , there 's so much junk up there			1
you do n't want to go up there , " she said			1
again , she thought nothing of it , " besides him being a pack rat			0
" the basement was always locked			1
prosecutor : ' kidnapper operated torture chamber ' clinging to the house the list of oddities continued			0
@entity6 clung to home , never wanting to leave for more than a day , even to visit @entity15 out of state when she lived with her family in @entity110			1
" he was adamant in the fact that he wanted to leave home early morning and he had to be back by evening , " @entity15 said			0
her family often made travel plans with @entity6 that they then had to cancel because of her father 's obsession with his own four walls			1
@entity15 said that she never saw signs of the 6 - year - old at her father 's house and that she never saw her with him			1
but about two months ago , he showed her a picture in his cell phone			0
@entity15 asked who it was			0
her father told her that the girl was his girlfriend 's child by somebody else			1
" i figured at the most he had an illegitimate child out there , you know , and i would find out eventually , " @entity15 said			0
she asked him to get a paternity test			0
she wanted to know if she had another sister out there somewhere			0
now she knows that she does			0

he lined up the children in the backyard and trimmed their bangs himself , she said			0
he took her for rides on his motorcycle			0
and he never abused her , she said , or her sisters , as far as she knows			0
but he beat their mother , @entity154 , whom he accused of fooling around with neighbors			1
he was very jealous , @entity15 said			0
" when @entity159 and @entity160 were fighting , it 's like i just wanted to melt into the ground , " she said			0
" i 've seen him basically stomp on her like she was a man , " @entity15 remembered			0
then after a bludgeoning , her mother had enough , and the family split up			0
the other children left with her mother , but @entity15 stuck by @entity6 , believing the excuses he made for the violence			1
she finished growing up under his roof , she said			0
how this case differed from the ' @entity173 ' a daughter divorced @entity15 is through believing in her father and is appalled at the extent of his alleged deception and cruelty			1
" to go to the vigils , to show these girls the footage of their parents ' pleas for their return , to rape , starve and beat innocent human beings ... i am disgusted			1
" @entity15 wants the girls who suffered in captivity to get the treatment they need , recover as well as they can and have the best lives possible			0
it was the first thing she mentioned during the interview			0
she is relieved to see them and the little girl , her new sister , return to their families			0
she hopes they can understand her father 's actions are not a reflection on her family			2
