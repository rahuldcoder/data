sheikh @entity22 , the son of a former emir of @entity2 , won @entity25 's most prestigious race , the @entity26 , sunday with the filly @entity28 and will be hoping his new purchase can achieve similar success			1

@entity28 is trained by @entity56 but the record breaking filly will be sent to @entity60 rival @entity58 for race preparation			1
