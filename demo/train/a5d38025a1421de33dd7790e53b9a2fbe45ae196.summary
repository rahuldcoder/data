you may have noticed an interesting reaction when you tell people you 're traveling to @entity3			0
they sometimes get that curious look , that knowing half - smile on their faces			0
" @entity3 , " they say with a mischievous grin , " lucky you ! " are they thinking about @entity13 and @entity14 , about the fabulous museums , the flowing canals , the teeming bicycle paths , the gorgeous tulips -- or is it something else ? to many , @entity3 is synonymous with freedom			0
with the ability to do what is forbidden in other places			2
throwback lodging : stay in another era undoubtedly , millions travel to the @entity26 to see the just re-opened @entity27 and its famous " @entity29 " painting , along with many other attractions of this truly charming city			1
but , let 's face it , @entity3 conjures another fascination			2
decades before anyone else considered legalizing marijuana , prostitution or gay marriage , the @entity26 stood -- as they still do today -- at the forefront of change on many controversial social issues , legalizing or tolerating a range of activities that other countries placed squarely outside what they consider legally and socially acceptable			1
that is not to say other countries did not have recreational drugs , homosexuality and prostitution			1
but the @entity26 , with their history of practicality and compromise , decided to deal with these matters in a pragmatic way			1
in the process , they created a whole new world for tourists craving tolerance and a brush with the forbidden			2
@entity3 remains a magnet for travelers who find the idea of smoking marijuana in public -- perhaps in front of a passing cop to add to the experience -- simply irresistible			1
still , there are great misconceptions about what is and is not legal here			2
the picture of a hedonistic free - for - all is not altogether accurate			0
the @entity26 are a people of rules and laws			1
although they also have an interesting approach to certain issues , where the law says one thing and the official policy is to look the other way			1
8 hotels still fresh at 100 so what , precisely , is legal in the @entity26 ? you may be surprised to learn that recreational drugs are illegal in the @entity26			1
yes , even pot. but an official policy of tolerance emerged and in 1976 the @entity26 parliament decriminalized possession of less than 5 grams of cannabis			1
that gave rise to a type of establishment found only in this country			0
in hundreds of " coffee shops " across the country -- not to be confused with " cafes " where you , in fact , go for coffee -- you can select from a menu of cannabis products and light up in full view indoors or at a sidewalk table			2
it is the crowded , cloudy coffee shops that give @entity3 its unmistakable summer aroma			0
the city is also home to countless seed shops , a hash and marijuana museum , and other businesses aimed at extracting cash from the peculiarly happy drug tourists			0
things got a little complicated in 2008 , when the @entity26 , as other countries , imposed restrictions on smoking in public places			1
a great battle ensued as coffee shop owners complained the ban would put them out of business			0
so , today , you can not smoke in most public establishments , but you can still smoke marijuana in a coffee shop			2
all non-medical drugs , to be clear , are illegal			1
but there are two categories			0
cannabis and some types of " recreational mushrooms " are in a separate class ; still illegal , but largely tolerated			1
the most powerful type of " magic mushrooms , " containing psilocybin , were made illegal in 2008 , but authorities say they will not prosecute anyone holding very small quantities			1
@entity146 is also in a gray area , up to each municipality to decide			0
not everyone likes this openness			0
@entity152 tourism is controversial in some circles and there are worries that lax laws attract more than just the tattoos and scraggly beard crowd , encouraging drug traffickers to enter the market			0
@entity152 aficionados across parts of the world panicked a couple of years ago when a conservative government announced plans to stem drug tourism , partly as a result of friction with neighboring countries			0
under the new rules , coffee shops would issue membership cards , @entity174 , only to local residents			0
foreigners would not be able to come to the @entity26 to get high			1
but , as coffee shop owners admit , it 's not the @entity26 who are lighting up			1
ninety percent of the customers getting buzzed in @entity3 are foreigners			0
@entity3 authorities complained the plan would take a huge financial toll , as millions of visitors every year inhale the offerings of coffee shop menus			0
after a very @entity26 debate on the pros and cons of the plan , the government rewrote the law , leaving it up to each city to decide on the rules			1
@entity3 scrapped it , while @entity200 , on the border with @entity198 and @entity199 , left the ban in place and imposed fines on coffee shop owners defying the ban on pot sales to foreigners			0
so , to recap : no cigarette smoking in public ; yes to pot in small quantities , but not in @entity200 , and mushrooms are ok in very small quantities			1
today , pot smokers can be found meandering aimlessly along @entity3 's famous @entity215 , the warren of alleyways and canals where prostitutes rent small rooms and stand in their windows , bathed in the light of red lamps before potential customers and sightseers			1
policemen pedal easily alongside visitors , keeping an eye on the scene			0
prostitution and brothels have been legal in the @entity26 since 2000			1
prostitutes are supposed to have work permits and enjoy the protections of the country 's labor laws			2
another area of controversy in which the @entity26 moved swiftly to the fore of social change is gay marriage			1
the @entity26 was the first country to fully legalize marriage equality			1
in 2001 , the world 's first same - sex ceremony was conducted by then - @entity3 mayor @entity245			2
you ca n't come to the @entity26 with your beloved to tie the knot , however : one of the partners has to be a @entity26 resident			2
you can , however , share the city with the hundreds of thousands of @entity253 who ride their bicycles to and from work every day			0
the law does not require you to wear a helmet and practically no one does			0
you are , however , required to have a light and a bell on your bike			2
if you walk , make sure to stay out of the official bike lanes			2
if you choose to drive a car , it is illegal to use a mobile phone while you drive , and if you run into a bicycle , @entity26 law places the responsibility on the driver of the car			1
so , if you go to a coffee shop , better not drive a car , or even a bicycle			0
lucky you if you 've come to @entity3			0
it 's a very special city			0
whether or not you want to enjoy the freedom of @entity3 , just remember there 's much more to the @entity26 than coffee shops and red lights			1
and the @entity27 is definitely worth a visit .			0

recreational drugs are illegal in the @entity26 , but there 's an official policy of tolerance
possession of small amounts of cannabis is not a crime
prostitution is legal
