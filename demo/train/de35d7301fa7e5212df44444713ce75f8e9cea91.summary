in recent days , @entity0 have enjoyed a media buzz as the value of one @entity0 jumped on several @entity0 exchanges to more than $ 200 per @entity0			1
but by wednesday , it fell to $ 105			0
bitcoins are an attempt at creating an electronic currency that is beyond the control of any government			1
they are created through a digital mining system , in which digital " miners " are granted @entity0 by using their computers to do computations that verify @entity0 transactions			1
with allegedly strict rules on the creation of @entity0 , the money supply is limited			1
theoretically , no government can water down the @entity0 with any type of quantitative easing			1
as a result , @entity0 seem to present the best of all possible worlds -- the convenience of modern digital payment technology and the stability of a fixed money supply			1
fearmongers point out that banks are no longer safe as government authorities in the @entity32 have signaled their willingness to confiscate funds from even insured depositors			0
those fearing the collapse of their local currency or their local banking system wo n't have to lug around hunks of metal as a way to store their wealth			1
why not turn to @entity0 ? the near anonymity built into the @entity0 system keeps funds away from the prying eyes of tax collectors , who are getting ever better at shutting down tax havens			1
this potential for anonymity makes the currency ideal for drug smugglers , terrorists and money launderers , as well as the merely paranoid			1
so are @entity0 the currency of the future ? i think not			1
no one really knows who is really behind @entity0 , as the creator is just a pseudonym @entity66			2
that in itself should be a huge red flag			0
i would certainly not trust my life savings to some mysterious computer algorithm created by shadowy anonymous characters in a system that attracts underworld types			0
one of the self - proclaimed largest @entity0 exchanges is @entity76			2
the name originally stood for @entity79 : the @entity80 , an online site designed to trade cards used in playing the card game popular with the younger set			0
an exchange based on trading kiddy cards does not seem like a sound foundation for a monetary system			0
there is no government regulating participants in the system to prevent fraud and abuse			0
i would not be surprised if the @entity0 mining software becomes a magnet for computer viruses			2
after all , the tax evaders , drug dealers and terrorists attracted to @entity0 would not be likely to cooperate with authorities when they have been hacked and robbed			1
it would be close to the perfect crime to create a pseudomonetary system that rips off other evildoers			2
just be careful when the bad guys find out where you live			0
even if the system is not one big scam designed to enrich its shadowy creators , it can be hacked and can break like any technology			1
the authorities wo n't be too eager to help out @entity0 - based financial enterprises when they get in trouble , just as they were all too eager to punish the depositors of the @entity120 banks storing questionable funds from @entity123 oligarchs			2
rather than being a safe place to keep money , the exchange rate of @entity0 relative to other global currencies has fluctuated wildly			1
the recent jumps on price give all of the impression of being a bubble that could soon pop. if @entity0 ever could establish itself as a legitimate payment scheme , which i doubt , it 's hard to tell what the appropriate exchange rates should be with respect to other currencies			2
bitcoins are not the first attempt to create digital money			1
other ventures , such as @entity145 , have come and gone , as well as various attempts to create local currencies			0
governments do n't like the competition			0
managing a currency is a very profitable activity for governments , and they depend on seignorage -- the profit stemming from printing money -- in various degrees to cover budget deficits			2
indeed , one can always pay the troops by printing more almost worthless money , as the @entity161 did in the @entity162 and @entity163 did in @entity164			0
one can expect governments to throw up legal roadblocks to prevent such competition from cutting into the lucrative business of printing money			0
moreover , it would not be good for the global economic system to have a totally fixed money supply			2
a growing economy needs a money supply that grows at the same rate to keep prices stable			0
much as we love to criticize the governmental entities that control the monetary system , it does help to have some human judgment ( armed with a checkbook ) involved to deal with crises			0
our banking system is as safe as it is because there are lenders of last resort who can create more money in a crisis to protect the entire system from collapsing in a liquidity crisis			1
@entity194 and @entity120 have discovered how painful it is to have a banking system without such a deep pocket lender of last resort			0
a financial system based on @entity0 would have no possibility of there being such a backstop			1
in short , @entity0 look like quite a bit of trouble .			0

bitcoins have enjoyed a media buzz as the value of one @entity0 jumped as high as $ 200

he says even if the system is not one big scam , it can be hacked like any technology
