you ca n't make us silent , " @entity10 said tuesday			1
" if you want to have us in ( a prison in ) @entity24 , you 'll have us there			2
but it will be the same headache for you , we guarantee you			0
" the release of the two punk rockers was approved last week when @entity3 lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law announced by @entity7			1
the @entity3 government said the amnesty marked the anniversary of the adoption of @entity3 's @entity35 constitution in 1993			1
but @entity10 , released from a @entity37 facility on monday , told @entity8 she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government 's image before it hosts the @entity42 in february			1
prison conditions the two plan on working to change the conditions -- which they compared to slavery -- in @entity3 's women 's prisons			1
" many people die there physically and many people die inside , " @entity9 said			1

if one girl slipped up , they all had to pay , @entity10 said			2
they 'd be forbidden from using the bathroom or not allowed to take breaks for a whole day			0
if they had a free day , they were n't allowed to lie down on their beds			0
they 'd only be allowed to sit on the wooden chairs by their beds			0

" @entity134 times she said the current government is weak , and eventually other @entity3 will see the problems and the corruption			1
" changes have begun , but you need to constantly work on them			0
the @entity3 system is designed in such a way that without social control , it will die immediately			1
because the people in the system will try to use every possibility to escape from their obligation and responsibilities			0
" not much , if anything , has changed since the days of @entity134 rule , they said			0
" if the @entity152 released a new order , it would be exact copy of the one from the @entity134 times			0
we 're going to change this , " @entity9 said			1
