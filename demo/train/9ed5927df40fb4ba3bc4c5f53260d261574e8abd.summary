-- for parents in @entity2 , giving their children immunizations is not a choice			2
in a country enduring more than 20 years of conflict , @entity2 is home to one of the highest child mortality rates in the world , with one in five @entity2 children dying before their 5th birthday , aid agencies say -- in many instances , from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines			1
yet for some equally loving parents in the developed world , the messages surrounding childhood vaccination have become muddied			1
some communities in areas previously considered disease - free are now falling below the levels of " herd immunity " required to protect against diseases such as measles , whooping cough and mumps			1
this week , in @entity29 , @entity30 , the local public health agency announced that 886 people have been diagnosed with measles in an epidemic that started in november			1
the outbreak has been attributed to low measles , mumps and rubella immunization rates			2
one man 's death has been linked to the measles virus , while 80 people have been hospitalized			1
in 2011 , six people in @entity43 died as a result of a measles epidemic that neared 15,000 confirmed cases , according to the @entity47			1
in 2010 , a whooping cough outbreak , resulting from pockets of under - vaccinated people in @entity51 , resulted in 10 deaths , according to the @entity53			1
nine of these were infants were too young to be vaccinated			0
" we are extremely concerned about what 's happening in some parts of the developed world , " said @entity57 , chief of immunization at @entity59 , one of the groups helping vaccination efforts in @entity2			1
" in the developing world , many people do n't even get the chance to be immunized			1
health systems are not strong enough to take the vaccine to every child despite the fact that their parents want it			2
" parents with real fears measles , whooping cough and @entity80 ) , along with many other childhood diseases , can be deadly , but they are vaccine - preventable			1
measles alone killed more than 150,000 people globally in 2011 , according to @entity47			1
@entity83 is also highly infectious , with one carrier likely to pass on the virus to between 14 and 18 other susceptible people , said dr. @entity87 of the @entity88 in the pediatrics department at the @entity90 , @entity91			2
despite the severity of these diseases , some parents in the developed world choose not to immunize their children and accept the risks			1
" studies show that it is the upper middle class , well - educated @entity104 parents who are shunning vaccines , " said dr. @entity98 , director of the @entity99 at the @entity100			1
" they have generally gone to graduate school , are in positions of management and are used to being in control			0
" a study released this month by the @entity112 in @entity113 reflected this trend			0
a number of affluent @entity117 suburbs were identified as regions where low levels of immunity have put entire communities at risk from these diseases			2
the reasons behind parents ' decisions are complex			2
part of the problem is lingering doubts around vaccine safety that were compounded by a retracted 1998 study linking the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine with autism			2
although declared an " elaborate fraud " by the @entity138 , it raised questions about the safety of immunization in the minds of many parents			2
these doubts then were spread worldwide on the @entity144 and in the media by anti-vaccination groups and some celebrities			0
" if you want to scare yourself about vaccines , it 's not that hard , " @entity98 said			2
" just turn on your computer			0
" for such parents , the perceived risks of vaccination outweigh the risks they associate with disease			1
vaccine - autism connection debunked again in @entity113 , where vaccination is not mandatory , the anti-vaccination @entity159 website says parents need to make an informed choice			1
the site offers links to articles and parental accounts of the potential side effects of many vaccines			0
a @entity59 working paper released this week to coincide with @entity170 has tracked the rise of anti-vaccination sentiment in @entity173 and @entity174 and concludes that poorly managed immunization campaigns in some countries have also contributed to the problem			0
concerned parents in the affected countries are taking to blogs and @entity181 , discussing their mistrust of vaccines and government programs , questioning the involvement of pharmaceutical companies and often recommending alternative medicine			1
a march survey conducted by the @entity190 organization @entity189 showed that 20 % of @entity190 believe there is a link between childhood vaccines and autism , and a further 34 % were not sure			1
diseases long forgotten in the developed world while there are some risks associated with vaccines , they are mostly minor , such as pain at the vaccine site or low - grade fever , according to the @entity204			1
a serious allergic reaction is rare and usually reported in less than one out of 1 million doses , the agency reported			0
" hundreds of millions of children every year are vaccinated , and the number of side effects we see is minimal , " @entity59 's @entity57 said			0
" the anti-vaccine groups focus on the potential side effects , not on the real side effects			0
" on the question of autism , numerous studies conducted over the past decade have all demonstrated there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism			0
with so much conflicting information readily available to parents , dr. @entity222 , program manager for vaccine - preventable diseases and immunization for @entity47 's @entity174 office , said she believes the decision of whether to immunize children has become so fraught that many parents choose to do nothing at all			2
" they have a difficulty dealing with the amount of information for and against ( vaccination ) on the @entity144 , and out of this confusion they are failing to recognize the risks of the disease , " she said			0
another factor driving parents ' decision not to vaccinate is the security that comes with herd vaccination , as rates of immunization for many diseases remain above 92 % for the population			1
but @entity174 's recent battle with measles demonstrates the problems under - vaccinated populations can pose , especially with older children			0
" @entity174 had 100,000 cases of measles from 2009 to 2012 , and that shows how prevalent the pockets of un-immunized populations are in that area , " @entity222 said			0
" almost 50 % of those cases were older than 10 years of age , and the older you are when you contract measles , the more severe the course of the disease			0
" another factor of these pockets is their affluence ; these parents tend to be the ones able to afford overseas travel			0
in 2008 , a 7 - year - old @entity190 boy whose parents chose not to immunize him against measles traveled with his family to @entity276			2
he caught the virus and returned to @entity278 , unknowingly exposing 839 people to the disease and infecting 11 unvaccinated children , according to the journal @entity283			0
in @entity174 and the @entity190 , parents and most people under 45 have never seen the effects of diseases such as measles , diphtheria or polio			1
" the fear factor ( among parents in the developed world ) is missing now -- the knowledge of what 's on the other side if you do n't have vaccinations , " said dr. @entity291 , ceo of the @entity292 , known as @entity292			1
the lack of knowledge of these diseases is also a problem among younger doctors and pediatricians , who may not be able to identify the signs , resulting in misdiagnoses			0
" there is a lot of value in case - based learning , but it is difficult to learn how to recognize these diseases if you have n't seen them before , " said @entity47 's @entity222			0
in contrast , most parents in the developing world , in places such as @entity2 , have seen family members suffer , be maimed or die from such diseases , health advocates said			1
education and motivation to address the problem , @entity291 prescribes localized programs in countries to supplement the already high overall levels of immunization			0
other physicians are supporters of parental education and want to ensure parents feel free to ask as many questions of their doctors and health care workers			0
dr. @entity336 of the @entity337 said further motivation may be necessary			0
" when you incentivize the parents in a meaningful way , whether it be financial or with other incentives , you can make an enormous difference in vaccination uptake , " he said			2
@entity291 , a doctor who specializes in epidemiology and global health , said he has seen the devastating effects of vaccine - preventable diseases in war - torn countries and refugee camps			0
@entity291 said he wished he could take some parents in the developed world " on a tour , show them how horrible it is			1
show them the illness that occurs out of these viruses			0
" " we 've brought down child mortality dramatically with these vaccination campaigns and we are making dramatic progress , but the challenge is getting people to understand what the world was like before this			1
