@entity12 hit four goals for the first time in his career in a dramatic eight - goal @entity17 thriller			2
a week after crashing out of the @entity19 7 - 5 on aggregate after sharing eight goals in their quarterfinal second leg at @entity23 , @entity6 took their fans on another rollercoaster ride			1

@entity35 striker @entity1 opened the scoring after 36 minutes and struck again after 67 , 70 and 90 as @entity2 bounced back following their weekend @entity38 semifinal defeat			1
@entity39 , with a header after 49 minutes , and @entity41 ( 56 ) hit back after halftime before @entity1 sent @entity2 3 - 2 ahead with 20 minutes left			1
@entity39 's second of the night after 72 hauled @entity45 's side level two minutes later -- but it took @entity41 to salvage a draw for @entity6 in the third minute of time added on after that man @entity1 had hit number four after 90 minutes			1
it was the first time in his career that @entity1 had scored four in a match and he told @entity54 : " i liked the game but of course it 's not good for the team ... almost basketball			2
" @entity2 boss @entity59 said of his @entity35 star : " his performance was outstanding			0
he had a quiet first half but when he comes into the game he is always very dangerous			0
he has personality and is a winner			0
" @entity6 manager @entity45 saw his team concede a quartet of sloppy goals but he could not fault their commitment to the cause			2
" you never know , " he said of the @entity8 ' dwindling hopes of overhauling @entity28			0
" today we made too many mistakes , but it 's also very positive because the team showed character until the last minute			0
" @entity45 added : " they ( @entity28 ) had it ( the advantage in the title race ) before and they continue in the driving seat			0
we have to keep pushing and showed today we will fight until the last game			0
