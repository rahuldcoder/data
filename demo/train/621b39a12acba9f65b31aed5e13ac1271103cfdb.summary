-- somewhere , @entity1 wants a royalty check			2
when @entity4 gov. @entity3 channeled his inner @entity5 and declared , " i am not a bully , " he did himself no favors			1
to be fair , @entity3 faced a dilemma : either admit to creating a climate of bullying , intimidation and political payback that led to the @entity14 scandal , or claim that his staff and appointees disrupted traffic on the world 's busiest bridge as political punishment without his knowledge			1
in the business we call it a choice between being a crook or a schnook			1
ladies and gentlemen , meet gov. @entity31			2
a schnook , for those who do n't speak @entity33 , is a dupe			1
a schnook is a victim , and @entity3 is not convincing playing the victim			1
he wants us to believe that @entity42 , @entity44 - @entity43 , credulously believed a pack of lies from his close aides			2
he wants us to believe that , as a former federal prosecutor , he thought his one - hour " investigation " of this operation , which yielded no confessions , was all that he could have done to unearth the truth			2
the governor clearly hopes that his press conference , his apology and his firing of one whole person will put this issue to rest			2
there 's a great old saying that battle - scarred scandal managers love : " the dogs bark but the carnival moves on			1
" it 's the crisis manager 's equivalent of " take two aspirin and call me in the morning , " meant to reassure the scandal - plagued public figure that the media and the public have short attention spans , and that the next twerking episode will distract folks			1
but not with the @entity3 bridge - closing scandal : this one 's gon na stick			1
how do i know ? three reasons : 1			2
it feeds a pre-existing narrative			0
this is the most important factor in determining whether a miscue becomes a scandal and whether a scandal becomes a permanent taint			1
any issue that advances a narrative that people already have is given greater credence and is more memorable			0
every public figure has a master narrative			0
in fact they have two : one positive , one negative			0
in the case of @entity3 , his larger - than - life persona has been drawn both with bold strokes and in vivid color			1
the positive narrative is compelling -- and true : the straight - talking , forceful , blunt leader ; the no - nonsense take - charge guy who blasted as " stupid and selfish " his own constituents who did not evacuate a beach community before a hurricane			0
@entity3 's negative narrative is just as powerful , and just as true : bully			1
he burst on the national scene in @entity111 clips of town hall meetings where he berated critics			0
as the @entity116 reported , as governor , @entity3 has a remarkable pattern of bullying : stripping former gov. @entity119 of his security detail after @entity119 called @entity3 " combative and difficult ; " cutting funding to a @entity124 program run by a professor who sided with @entity126 on a redistricting panel , and more			1
if , as it appears , @entity3 's appointees and staff forced @entity132 to suffer through a four - hour traffic jam because their mayor -- a @entity134 -- had the temerity to back the @entity126 candidate opposing @entity3 's re-election , it does n't just feed the image of a bully ; it cements it			1
there are ongoing legal and political processes			2
the @entity126 majority leader of the @entity143 , @entity142 , described herself as shocked by the scandal			2
more important -- and more ominous , for @entity3 -- she declared , " i am waiting -- and hopefully with the support of @entity146 ( and deputy speaker john ) wisniewski -- that the subpoena power will continue			1
" continuing subpoenas mean continuing revelations			0
" sooner rather than later , " @entity142 said , " we 're going to hear the whole story of who knew what when			0
" there are almost certainly going to be lawsuits from aggrieved commuters , which will put folks under oath			0
and , most ominously , the @entity161 attorney has said he is looking into the matter			0
if this becomes a federal case , the stakes rise immeasurably			0
it happened at the media epicenter			0
it 's not fair , but it 's true : the news media is based largely on the @entity171 and principally in @entity172			2
if the governor of @entity176 closed the @entity177 , which connects @entity176 to @entity178 , most of the national media would not know or care			0
but this is the @entity14			0
journalists can cover this story , literally , on their commute			0
@entity3 's proximity to the media center has helped fuel his celebrity ; now it may fuel his downfall			1
the truth is there is not much @entity3 can do about these three dynamics			1
he tried apologizing , but kept returning to the plea that he is truly the victim here : that he 's just a poor schnook who was lied to			1
it seems to me that is small comfort to the thousands of people who endured four - hour traffic jams , or schoolchildren trapped on endless bus rides , or the family of the elderly woman who died after emergency services were slow in getting to her			0
he tried blaming others , as if acting in a @entity211 fashion is totally antithetical to his political style			0
soon he will return to attacking the press and @entity126			0
none of it will work			0
if you believe @entity218 is going away anytime soon , there 's a bridge in @entity220 i 'd like to sell you			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 : @entity3 faces difficult choice between being seen as a crook or a schnook
he says @entity3 is not convincing playing the victim of his own staff
@entity224 says the scandal is likely to haunt @entity3 because it fits *perceptions* of him as a bully
the investigative and legal process will grind on , to @entity3 's *detriment* , @entity224 says
