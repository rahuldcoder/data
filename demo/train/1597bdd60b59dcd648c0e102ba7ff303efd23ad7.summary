-- i 've never really been a fan of the " men are from @entity7 , women are from @entity4 " school of relationship thought , but i 'll admit that sometimes i feel as though the men i 've dated have spoken a different language			1
like when a great date is followed by the deafening silence of the phone			0
or when the big relationship talk results in a boyfriend - shaped hole in my wall			0
those are the times i want nothing more than a dictionary that translates every deer - in - headlights look , ambiguous voicemail , and cryptic text message			0
that 's where @entity27 's " @entity25 : decoding the @entity28 " comes in			1
the good actions speak louder than words			0
sure , not a novel idea , but this " duh " lesson is one that can take years to learn			0
if it looks , walks , and quacks like a duck , then it 's a duck			2
@entity37 's @entity36 ? whenever there is any conflict between what a man says and what he does , always , always ignore what he says			1
there is no such thing as a man dumping you because he is afraid of getting hurt , is frightened that his feelings are too strong , or because he finds you intimidating			2
@entity37 says to think of the simplest solution -- is it that this man sensed you were the perfect woman for him , who touched him so much in deep , important places that he could n't handle ? or was he just not feeling it ? it 's ok to call him first -- and if you get blown off , it 's not because you called first			1
this is my favorite piece of advice from @entity37 , who says the mistaken conclusion women come to when they call first post-date and get blown off is that the call made them look clingy and spooked the guy			1
" this is not how it went , " says @entity37 " if you called him and he blew you off , it went like this : 1			0
you had a great date , and he did not			0
he planned to blow you off			0
you called him , and nothing changed			0
" the bad all men are obsessed with cars , the remote , sports , and video games			2
for the record , my man keeps his video game playtime short , hands remote control power over to me , and does n't care for sports or cars			2
is my guy an exception to the rule , or is it possible that all men are different and do not necessarily share those interests as a gender ? i 'm guessing it 's the latter			1
the ugly men are like dogs			2
is this statement required filler for all dating books , right after the part about women being shopping - obsessed nags ? according to @entity37 , men are like dogs because , among other things , they have short attention spans and pay a lot of attention to their own crotches and the crotches of others			1
i 'm willing to bet short attention span is n't an inherently male trait , and i can personally testify that neither is an interest in crotches			0
so is @entity27 's " @entity122 " the be-all and end - all of man manuals ? not exactly			1
but when your girlfriends refuse to help you decode , for the eighth time , what he meant when he said , " i 'll call you later , " @entity27 's sometimes trite , always funny advice comes in handy			1

woman rates @entity27 's " @entity122 : decoding the @entity28 of men "
if there 's conflict between what man says or does , always ignore what he says
her favorite : ok for women to call guy first , and if dumped , it 's not because of call
