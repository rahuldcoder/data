@entity0 , a @entity1 - based management consultant , recalls the agonizing one - on - one meetings he sat through years ago with a micromanaging boss			1
but when one day the boss changed tack and asked him to go on walks instead , it transformed their working and personal relationship			2
" somehow , when we were outside under the blue sky , getting a little exercise , he lightened up			0
we got along great after that , " @entity0 says			0
" group meetings where everyone is standing up have caught on in the past few years			2
but for one - on - one conversations , the trend at forward - thinking firms is to hold meetings while walking			1
@entity21 , the late founder of @entity22 , @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity25 of @entity26 have all been known to favor walking meetings			1
recently , @entity28 , a former technology executive , extolled the benefits of walk - and - talk meetings at a @entity32 conference , noting the health advantages and the closer connections people form when away from the more traditional setting of a conference room			1
" by walking side by side , it reinforces the perspective that you 're working on something together , " @entity28 says			2
merchant , who previously worked for @entity22 , the software company @entity44 and a slew of other technology firms , said the decision to hold meetings while walking was born out of her own health concerns			1
she was frustrated about not being able to fit enough exercise into her week			0
after starting this style of meeting , it no longer was a choice between getting things done and staying healthy , she says , " because i could potentially do both at the same time			0
" see also : sick of meetings ? make them matter walking meetings now account for about 70 % of the exercise merchant gets per week , she says			1
she still fits in a run or a gym session once a week			0
but she has found it difficult to persuade colleagues to go on walking meetings , partly because of the ingrained ideas of what a meeting should entail			1
" the cultural norm is to sit , which is why sitting is the smoking of our generation : everyone does it , and it 's so common , asking someone to be active definitely seems weird to everyone i ask , " she says			1
" also , some people are ashamed of how unfit they are			0
" there are practical concerns as well			0
those asked to go on walks frequently wonder how to take notes and are uneasy about being away from their mobile devices			2
but @entity28 says that she still jots down notes on walks when an important point comes up and that cell phones are just distractions during meetings			1
" walking meetings result in undivided attention because the mobile device is n't within eyesight , tempting you to step away from the moment , " she says			1

research by fitness experts has shown that the simple act of getting up helps office employees think better			1
@entity113 , vice president of @entity114 , a consulting group owned by @entity116 , has advocated a program that calls for standing up and walking around in the workplace for one or two minutes about every half hour , a process that he says would increase productivity			2
@entity113 says when workers start moving , it triggers a slight raise in heart rate for the first minute or two , meaning more oxygen is getting to the brain			2
" what we did find in the studies that we did , after 90 days of doing this , people felt increased amounts of energy , they felt increased focus , they felt improved engagement , " he says			0
but the idea is not to be taking a break from work			0
" what we 're saying is you can move and function while being productive , " @entity113 says , suggesting people take a document to read while they walk			0
for this concept to catch on , corporate leaders would need to endorse the idea of routinely standing up to stretch during group meetings , @entity113 says			0
" leaders have to be very involved , giving permission and role modeling them			0
" as for walking meetings , @entity0 sees another obstacle for them to gain traction in the workplace : " people seem to be getting more and more lazy and sedentary , not less			1
