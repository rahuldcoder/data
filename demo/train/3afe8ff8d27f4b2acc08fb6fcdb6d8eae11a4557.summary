-- 2010 has , so far , been a great year for women in film			1
from @entity8 's record - breaking " the @entity7 " to @entity5 's @entity6 - winning " @entity4 , " women seem to be thriving behind the camera			1
but , these success stories are very much the exception in a male - dominated global industry			2
@entity13 and @entity14 are two women trying to change that : they are , respectively , the managing director and founder of the @entity20 which celebrates and promotes female filmmakers			1
@entity22 brings together female directors from @entity24 to @entity25 to participate in screenings and workshops			1
@entity28 hopes to inspire more young women to try their hand at directing and screenwriting -- long considered to be men 's work			2
movies being screened include @entity38 's " whip it , " @entity37 's @entity36 winner " @entity40 " and " @entity41 " by @entity42 , a 2009 @entity43 nominee			1
here @entity28 talks to @entity0 's @entity44 about the particular challenges facing women looking for their big break and how the festival hopes to help			1
the screening room : what is the aim of the @entity52 ? @entity13 : the festival is there to promote and showcase the best of women across the world			1
we bring over women from lots of different countries ... this year we have film makers from @entity63 and from @entity64 , and @entity25 as well as lots of other places			1
@entity44 : what is the situation of women in the film industry and does this vary from country to country ? what are the specific challenges women face in , for example , @entity78 ? am : the interesting thing about the role of the director as a woman in film is that it does n't really change depending on which county you 're in			1
the restrictions that exist around that role and the problems for women in that role exist everywhere			0
@entity44 : what kinds of challenges do women in the film industry face ? am : knowing that the role of the director is erratic and the schedule is all over the place and very demanding , knowing that , it means that child rearing actually becomes a massive issue and being on location -- quite often for long periods of time -- makes it really , really limiting and makes it really , really hard to actually be a mom			1
@entity44 : what is the single biggest challenge for a woman who wants to enter the industry ? am : i think that bringing up children whilst being in the role of director is the biggest challenge and i think it 's something that needs to be recognized , so ideally the industry will respond to that			2
i think it is a real challenge , and i think since early cinema it has become a very male dominated industry and we 've had , sadly , reports of sexism on set which is a real worry			0
obviously , those reports are n't commonplace ... everyone needs to know that that 's the case and we need to support the women in the industry			1
@entity44 : what is the festival doing to promote women in film ? am : we 're launching two training labs , which are held at @entity22 throughout the year			2
one of them is a screenwriting program called " she writes , " which is for screenwriters who are emerging in the industry			0
they follow a year long mentoring program , specifically on scripts that they 're working on			0
we 're also launching another lab , which is an animation lab called " @entity145 , " which is in partnership with @entity147			0
now , that project is about brining together screenwriters and animators			0
the process it follows is the same as " she writes , " so it 's a mentoring program ... the result will be that two or three projects will be taken on the development slate of @entity147			2
@entity44 : do you have any statistics about women in the industry ? am : we know that in 2007 only seven percent of directors in the @entity164 were women			1
this spiked up slightly in 2008 to 12 percent , but since the recession hit , we 've had reports that it 's gone down as much as 20 percent			0
screenwriters are n't much better off either			0
in 2007 , it was 12 percent , and it went up to 18 percent in 2008			0
but again , that 's dipped as we 've gone into the recession			0
@entity44 : what are the most popular roles for women in the industry ? am : ; there 's a lot of female editors and there 's a lot of producers			2
we had an interesting chat with someone the other day , about women editors in early cinema and how editing was likened to sewing , which is why it was more permissible in the female domain			0
so , there 's more female actresses and producers , but directors and screenwriters is where the real problem is .			0
