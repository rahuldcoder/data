-- this @entity1 season the classic film most of us will watch on our televisions is @entity7 's " it 's a @entity6			1
" with good reason : it 's the perfect feel - good @entity1 movie			1
in celebrating the quiet good works that @entity12 's @entity11 has done in running his family 's savings and loan bank for the benefit of the residents of @entity18 , " @entity18 " tells the story of @entity21 modesty at its best			2
but the movie we ought to be watching this @entity1 season is another 1946 classic , @entity25 's " @entity24			1
" with a script by playwright @entity27 , who also was a speechwriter for president @entity28 , " @entity24 " tells the story of the difficulties three @entity32 veterans overcome on returning to their peacetime lives in the fictional @entity35 town of @entity36			1
what makes the @entity47 - winning " @entity24 " so relevant are the problems today 's veterans -- now coming home in increased numbers with the end of the @entity44 war -- are having finding a place in civilian life			1
veterans in the 20 - 24 age bracket have an unemployment rate of nearly 30 % , more than double the 14.5 % unemployment rate of nonveterans in the same age group , and veterans of all ages have an unemployment rate of 11.8 % compared with the civilian unemployment rate of nearly 9 %			1
equally alarming are the mental health figures for today 's returning vets			2
according to the @entity61 , veterans account for about one in five of the more than 30,000 suicides committed annually in the @entity21 , and the problem is only getting worse			0
this year 10,000 combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder entered @entity66 hospitals every three months , pushing the number of vets ill with ptsd to 200,000 , according to the @entity66			0
" @entity24 " does not present us with a programmatic answer for how to help returning vets			1
@entity25 does not even mention the @entity73 , which eventually made it possible for 4.3 million vets to purchase homes at low interest rates and for 2.2 million vets to attend college			0
but what " @entity24 " does emphasize is that for those who fight them , our wars continue long after they officially end			0
in " the @entity24 , " @entity84 , a banker played by @entity85 , is the best off of the three vets , but only because of the patience of his wife can @entity84 settle back into the routine of office work			1
@entity92 , an @entity93 bomber captain played by 1940s leading man @entity95 , discovers his wife has been unfaithful to him , and gets back on his feet only because he persuades a compassionate local businessman to give him a job turning old @entity100 bombers into scrap that can be used for building houses			0
and @entity103 , a sailor played by real - life veteran @entity104 , who lost both his hands in a @entity32 training accident , is able to accept the notion that he is n't a freak because the girl he left behind finally convinces him that his wounds do n't repel her			2
the result is a series of bittersweet endings that are inseparable from the film 's implicit belief that most vets ca n't succeed on their own when they return home			0
the release of " @entity24 " in november 1946 made it possible for @entity25 to deliver his bittersweet message during @entity21 's second @entity123			2
the timing was perfect for a director whose three years of service in the @entity127 did not blind him to the harsh realities that followed even a " good war			0
" the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity133 .			0

many will watch " @entity18 " this @entity1 season , @entity135 says
@entity138 : but the movie we should watch is another 1946 classic , " @entity24 "
@entity47 - winning film shows peacetime difficulties faced by three @entity32 vets , he says
today , veterans aged 20 - 24 have an unemployment rate of nearly 30 % , @entity138 says
