@entity2 as @entity1 attempt to build more inroads with black voters , the @entity0 sought to highlight its progress on wednesday , recognizing three newly elected black republicans to @entity8			1
the committee held its third annual awards lunch at the @entity11 , a historic black landmark in @entity2 where the @entity0 and more than 400 attendees also paid tribute to the late @entity15 sen. @entity15 , the first @entity16 popularly elected to the @entity17 , who died last month at the age of 95			1
the event recognized sen. @entity20 of @entity21 , the first black senator elected from the @entity22 ( in 2014 he was elected to the same seat he was appointed to in december 2012 ) ; rep. @entity24 , the first black @entity1 elected to @entity8 from @entity25 ; and rep. @entity26 of @entity27 , the first black @entity1 woman to serve in @entity8			1
@entity29 , owner of the @entity30 and a major @entity1 donor , helped introduce the three lawmakers			2
" it 's amazing to me that we 're dealing with ' firsts ' in this century , " @entity29 told @entity3 in an interview after the event			2
" there should be ' seconds , thirds and fourths , ' and really the @entity1 is open to all			2
" while @entity1 had a big year in 2014 , @entity20 and @entity26 still won largely with the support of white voters , while @entity24 won with the support of white and @entity46 voters			2
in @entity21 , for example , @entity20 won 10 % of the black vote , only slightly more than the other @entity21 senator , @entity49 , who 's white and brought in 6 % of the black vote			0
" we 've got a ways to go , " @entity0 chairman @entity51 said on stage wednesday			2
" i know we 're not going to carpet the world here in one or two years or one election cycle , but it 's an improvement , and we always have to be improving as a party			0
" black voter turnout in the midterm election this past november did reach into the double - digits in some states , like @entity64 ( 12 % ) , @entity65 ( 10 % ) and in @entity66 , where gov. @entity67 won re-election with 26 % of the black vote			0
for her part , @entity26 told a story about a student who asked @entity26 how she 's able to be a black @entity1 woman living in a red state like @entity27 in " today 's @entity74			1
" " i am all of those things because i refuse to fit this mold that society tells me i need to fit into , " she replied			0
see also : @entity1 places hopes on new class of black republicans @entity26 also urged @entity1 to focus on a message of being independent from government			2
" people who are independent are the ones that make a difference , " she said			0
" we need to remove ourselves from a different kind of slavery , and what i 'm talking about is the slavery that comes from being dependent on people in power			0
" narrowing the @entity1 's gap with minority voters became a priority following the 2012 presidential loss , when @entity97 won only 6 % of the @entity16 - @entity74 vote and 27 % of the @entity46 vote			1
@entity97 's privately recorded comments , in which he argued that 47 % of @entity74 were dependent on government , became a damaging moment for the then - nominee , and it 's a message that @entity1 are still trying to run from			1
" the reason @entity1 lost can be summed up in two words : 47 % , " sen. @entity105 of @entity25 , who 's seriously considering a presidential bid , said recently at an event sponsored by the @entity108			1
that lesson helped spur renewed attention to anti-poverty efforts , and some potential presidential contenders , like sen. @entity115 and gov. @entity116 , have tried to appeal to minority voters by focusing on criminal justice reform			0
wednesday 's event largely stayed away from policy and focused more on efforts @entity1 have made to build relationships with black voters through community outreach and black media			1
the party has spent millions on hiring staff who are tasked with improving the @entity1 brand in places with nontraditional @entity1 voters			1
" as we enter the presidential election year , we 'll share our ideas with @entity74 of all backgrounds , " @entity51 said , adding that he 's committed to building a more " inclusive " @entity1			1
" this is about being present all the time			0
@entity74 is strongest when both parties fight to earn every vote			0
no voter should be taken for granted , and no voter should be overlooked , " he said			0
the event also did n't touch on racial tensions that erupted last year with the shooting death of @entity145 , an unarmed black teenager , by a police officer in @entity147 , @entity148 , or the death of @entity150 , an unarmed black man who was killed by police in a chokehold in @entity153			0
both cases , in which the officers were not indicted , became a political flashpoint and spurred mass protests across the country			0
@entity159 , director of african - american media at the @entity161 , argued the @entity0 lunch was simply a " perfunctory gesture " and called on republicans to " actually fight for the issues that most affect black families across the country , " naming education , health care and minimum wage as examples			1
" while minority ' outreach ' is sorely lacking in today 's @entity1 , what is even more lacking is a record of real results , " @entity159 said			1
@entity3 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

as part of a @entity182 *celebration* , @entity1 paid tribute to record - setting *members* of @entity8
it 's part of the @entity0 's effort to build a more *welcoming* brand for the @entity1
