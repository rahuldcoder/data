-- in january , @entity1 , 68 , began a journey of threes			1
she had three milestones of 50 that she planned to reach by following three simple rules : at 175 pounds , the 5 - foot - 1 @entity1 was at her heaviest weight			1
she vowed to lose 50 pounds so she could fit into a 50 - year - old dress from high school			1
determined to stun all her old classmates , @entity1 saw her invitation to @entity12 's 50th reunion as the catalyst to spark a lifestyle change			1
voted " @entity19 " by her classmates in 1964 , the @entity16 , @entity17 , resident was determined to reclaim some of her youth			1
" i wanted to go back [ to high school ] as i left , " she says			1
" still having fun in life ... looking slim and feeling as good as i did back then			2
" looking back , @entity1 would never have predicted she 'd have weight problems			1
" if i had seen a photo of myself as i look right now ... i would have died of embarrassment ! " but though she was thin , her eating habits were far from healthy			2
" in my teens , i would go on all sorts of diets -- one time all i ate was hot dogs -- to make sure i fit into all my pretty dresses			2
" once she started her career , those bad choices began to take their toll			2
she started to travel a lot and it became easy to eat what she calls " road food " frequently			2
" i remember my first bite of a @entity42 donut			0
it was heaven ! i wanted more and many			0
one time i did a photo shoot at a @entity42 place and they gave us two dozen donuts			0
i ate five in one sitting			2
" her poor eating habits caused her health to slowly deteriorate -- both mentally and physically			0
she began to feel so self - conscious about her body that she only wore polyester pants and would never tuck her shirt in for fear of showing just how much weight she had gained			0
when she received news of her upcoming reunion , @entity1 vowed to follow what she called the " @entity62 " so that she could wear her favorite high school dress again			1
her first step was watching what she ate			1
she tried to eat only 1,300 calories per day of almost entirely unprocessed foods			0
she purchased a step tracker and made sure to log 10,000 to 25,000 steps per day , even if that required her to walk the halls and stairs of her hotel late at night			0
the last step was drinking lots of water			1
she began to drink five to six bottles a day to ensure she was staying hydrated in the midst of all of her walking			2
complicating her mission , @entity1 knew she was going to be on the road during the months leading up to the reunion , working on a photography project for the @entity85 , capturing photos of 21st century @entity87 for the prints and @entity89			1
she would also be staying busy with her this is @entity87 ! foundation , which she founded to capture and catalog hundreds of thousands of photos of " slices of @entity87 life threatened by technological change , rampant development and widespread cultural homogenization			0
" she had to customize her weight loss strategy to her nomadic lifestyle			0
although gas stations full of candy and other unhealthy snacks beckoned , @entity1 fought cravings by carrying unsalted nuts , canned baked beans , unsweetened @entity107 yogurt and fresh fruit			1
for breakfast , @entity1 would generally eat fruit , poached eggs , ham and a little milk and coffee			1
@entity115 was key for keeping her full well into the afternoon			0
@entity116 was a less structured meal			0
@entity1 made a point to never eat lunch " just because it was lunchtime , " but to wait until she genuinely felt hungry			1
then she would eat some yogurt , fruit and nuts , or a fresh salad			0
for dinner , she usually ordered grilled fish , sweet potatoes and vegetables			0
sometimes she would allow herself to splurge on a carefully measured pat of butter for her sweet potatoes			0
" every time i thought about not walking all the steps or not drinking the water or having just one extra handful of nuts , i thought about how much fun it ( would ) be to go the @entity12 reunion and look like a million , " says @entity1			1
between her healthy eating habits and being constantly on her feet , @entity1 watched as the pounds melted away			1
" every day that i follow my weight loss plan i am thrilled , " @entity1 wrote to @entity0 in the middle of her journey			1
" all of it helps me feel better about myself			0
when i look in the mirror and see a slimmer me , i am more confident and know i look good in my clothes			0
" she was careful , though , not to get distracted from her main goal : her health			0
" i eat only when i am hungry , but if i get hungry , i need to eat , " says @entity1			2
" i am not on a starvation diet -- i am on a healthy , let me lose this weight and live longer journey			2
i never mention the word ' diet			0
' " when the day of her 50th high school reunion arrived , @entity1 was ready and eager to show off her new physique			1
her classmates were stunned with her transformation			2
" i was very impressed , " says former classmate @entity159 , who has stayed in touch over the years			0
" she was very disciplined about her food intake and her exercise			0
@entity1 usually does whatever she sets her mind to doing ... she always gives everything 115 %			2
" @entity1 's message to her classmates ? " find a way to turn back the clock and wake up feeling good every day			1
" at 130 pounds , @entity1 's journey is not over			1
she plans to lose 20 more pounds by her birthday in may 2015 , vowing to continue eschewing sweets , walking at least 10,000 steps per day , and eating and drinking properly			1
but she is in no rush to see the numbers on the scale go down			0
" i am not trying to lose it fast because i did not gain it fast , " says @entity1			1
" we are what we eat and i have decided for the rest of my life that if something goes into my mouth , it must be good for me			0
