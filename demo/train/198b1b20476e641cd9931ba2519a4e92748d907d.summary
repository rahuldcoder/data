-- to call " @entity1 " " highly anticipated " at this point would be an understatement			1
the fervor for @entity7 's third @entity6 film has been so intense , tickets were selling out in select theaters back in january , months ahead of its july 20 @entity11 opening			1
with this being the third and final film in an acclaimed trilogy , each casting announcement and trailer clip has been thoroughly analyzed and discussed			0
and now , thanks to early reviews that have circulated on monday , the fascination with " @entity1 " has reached a new level			1
" @entity24 - time @entity23 filmmaking at its most massively accomplished , this last installment of @entity7 's @entity6 trilogy makes everything in the rival @entity28 look thoroughly silly and childish , " says the @entity21 's @entity20			1
" entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined , as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of @entity7 's trio , even if it lacks ... an element as unique as @entity38 's immortal turn in ' @entity39			1
' " a review from @entity41 at @entity42 's @entity42 says even more effortless than @entity7 's filmmaking is the way the movie " fits into the summer 's conversation about @entity45 that are preoccupying us , even when we 're walking into darkened theaters and asking only to be entertained			1
" set eight years after the events of 2008 's " @entity39 , " the latest installment finds @entity6 / @entity6 ( played to applause by @entity52 ) in seclusion			2
@entity54 not blames the caped crusader for the death of @entity57			0
there 's even been a drop in crime in @entity54 -- that is , until @entity63 's masked sociopath @entity64 rips into @entity54 , leaving terror and death in his wake			0
with aid from @entity70 's @entity69 , who initially lures @entity6 out of hiding with a burglary , @entity6 tracks down @entity64 only to find that it is going to take some doing to vanquish this villain			2
@entity41 calls the film " a cinematic , cultural and personal triumph , " adding that the story " is emotionally inspiring , aesthetically significant and critically important for @entity11 itself -- as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope			0
" @entity83 's @entity82 notes that , " all in all , the picture impressively conveys a seething vision of urban anxiety that speaks to such issues as the greed and complacency of the one percent , the criminal neglect of the poor and oppressed , and above all the unsettling sense that no one and nothing is safe			0
" @entity96 's review from @entity97 found that " @entity1 " " more than fulfills the promise made by the first two films			2
" " we may never see superhero films quite like these again , and that 's fine , " the review continues			2
" @entity106 hires to reboot the ' @entity6 ' films a few years from now , i wish you luck			0
the bar is as high as it could possibly be			0
" agrees @entity112 's @entity111 , " the most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for			0
... the movie may not top ' @entity116 ' at the worldwide box office , but it is a far , far better thing -- maybe the best , most troubling , assured and enthralling of all the superhero movies			1
