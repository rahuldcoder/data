-- @entity2 championship leader @entity1 feels like a " kid at @entity4 " thanks to the dominance of his @entity7 car which was underlined again friday as he set the fastest time in both practices for the @entity9			1
@entity1 needs to finish no lower than second to teammate @entity10 in sunday 's final race of the season to clinch his second world title , but after edging the @entity14 out in either session could not have wished for a better start to the weekend			1
