it was on a platform of the @entity2 that @entity3 realized he finally had to snap out of it			1
he was just back from nearly 100 days sailing around the globe with no sighting of another human being , his only contact to the outside world a satellite phone			1
his body was , in essence , still on red alert for any obstacle in his midst			2
" waiting for the train , a guy was in the way of the doors and i just yanked him out of the way , " recalls the 48 - year - old , who just days earlier had returned to @entity18 victorious from the grueling @entity20 race			2
" i was still in that mindset of not letting anything get in my way			2
it was then i said to myself , ' @entity3 , the race is over now			1
' but it 's hard as solo racing just takes over your body and mind			1
" it is 45 years since @entity38 yachtsman @entity37 became the first man to perform a singlehanded , nonstop circumnavigation of the globe , achieving the feat in 312 days			1
he was the only person to finish of the eight - man field in the @entity45 , during which one competitor @entity46 died -- having committed suicide after attempting to fake the details of his own round - the - world attempt			1
so what makes someone decide to take on such a daunting challenge ? to spend months away from family and friends , coping on a mere four hours of sleep a night -- most of that broken -- while tackling monster waves on the world 's most challenging waters ? for @entity37 , also the oldest person to sail around the planet solo , aged 68 back in 2007 , the lure of such a perilous challenge is obvious			1
" it 's what i do -- i do the sea , " he says unapologetically			1
" to people it may seem dangerous , foolish even but , for me , it 's not a strange environment			1
it 's not alien to me , it 's where i 'm happiest			1
" as for circumnavigating the globe that first time , i did n't want to get to 90 years old and think what i could have done			1
it was dangerous , particularly as no - one had done it before , so you could n't read up on it , and frequently you feel in danger			1
having 27 meters crashing down on your boat will make you feel that way			2
" see : the best sailing images of 2013 back in 1968 , there was none of the communications enjoyed by today 's sailors , requiring instinct more than anything else			1
so how did @entity37 's voyage compare nearly four decades on ? " you realize that round - the - world sailing is a young man 's game , " he says			1
@entity3 is one of the best modern - day exponents of solo sailing -- the only two - time winner of the prestigious @entity20 , in 2001 and 2009 -- and he was born into the sailing fraternity			1
his father , who served in the resistance during @entity101 , founded @entity102 -- which teaches 15,000 trainees each year			2
nicknamed " the professor , " @entity3 is more than just a sailor , he is also an innovator			1
he writes software for the auto - pilot systems used by many sailors , and has also been integral in developing boating equipment , including the introduction of a sideways - swinging keel 11 years ago			2
despite his wide - ranging proficiency , he is no stranger to adversity on the open seas			2
just last month , his yacht dismasted while leading the two - handed @entity117 race from @entity118 in @entity18 to @entity119 in @entity120 , just 140 miles ( 260 kilometers ) from the finishing line			0
speaking by satellite phone to @entity123 just hours before that moment on board his vessel @entity125 , he explained why he first set out on the solo voyages			1
" first , your life is too short to do something you do n't want to do , " he says			0
" second , you will not be efficient because you do n't want to do it , and third the most important one is if you do n't want to do it then you will make mistakes and then not be efficient			0
" in safety terms , that 's when things go wrong			1
before anything else , you have to want to do it , otherwise that 's it , no point			2
" @entity3 says the all - consuming nature of the racing ( " 24 hours of the day , you 're just trying to optimize everything " ) means it is a completely different way of life , hence his personal struggles to get back into everyday norms on land			1
he says the @entity20 , a three - month ordeal held every four years , is " the most complete and perfect race you can imagine			0
" so when i finished the first time , i was sure i 'd come back - it was still something i wanted to do			0
" it is common to see sharks and dolphins in the water , as well as whales -- although the large mammals are to be avoided at all costs because of the damage they can do to a vessel , which is often battling treacherous seas			0
" i do n't think there is too much danger as safety on the boat is always no. 1 , " says @entity3			1
" i do n't take too many risks			0
if it 's dangerous , i slow down and do it properly			2
i want to keep my life			0
" traveling around the world in a vessel is not just about being a master sailor , a tactician or mentally strong			0
it is also about being a businessman and raising the funds required to get such an expedition off the ground			0
budgets for the 2008 - 9 @entity20 were around € 10 million ( $ 13.8 million ) for the very top boats , each of the leading boats costing about € 3.5 million ( $ 4.8 million )			0
such numbers makes @entity38 racer @entity190 's achievement at that race all the more impressive			1
he arrived on the start line not knowing if he even had enough funds to compete			0
under competition rules , all boats taking part having to be in the harbor at @entity197 three weeks before the start date			0
just to get to that point , he had remortgaged his and his wife 's house four times in order to buy the boat on which he aimed to compete			2
he had two weeks in which to raise £ 200,000 ( $ 328,000 ) to fund the trip , a big sum but small fry in global sailing terms			2
" i had this green energy company all set to sponsor me to the tune of £ 100,000 , as well as another businessman to another £ 100,000 , " he recalls			0
" the green energy company were on board , they just needed things to be signed off in one final meeting			0
but then they went quiet and finally i got word that they were n't going ahead			0
" so i went back to the guy ( the businessman , who to this day has asked to remain nameless ) and said i could n't match his £ 100,000 so i did n't expect him to fulfill his side of the bargain			0
so i thought i 'd have to face the embarrassment of sailing away before the start in front of everyone			2
" he just said , ' i 'll get back to you			0
' i carried on but felt sick and did n't hear back			0
i was struggling with phone reception but got a snippet about four o'clock one morning from my wife to say , ' we 've got the money			0
' " when i finally spoke to her , it transpired this guy had stumped up the entire money			0
in a flash , i 'd gone from suicidal to being in tears			0
he 'd essentially sorted me out for the rest of my life by enabling me to do this			0
" in the end , the trip cost £ 245,000 , which @entity190 part - funded by being paid his € 20,000 prize money for finishing eighth in advance			1
but it was a race against the clock just to get ready , as he and his team worked through the night to get the boat prepared			0
by the time he set off for his 109 days at sea , he was already shattered			0
almost immediately , terrible weather hit in the @entity257 , breaking up the much more expensive boats of his rivals			0
in all , just 11 of the 30 - strong fleet finished			0
" i enjoy being alone at sea , and in a weird sort of way love testing myself and seeing if i pass the test , " @entity190 says			1
" but it 's an odd test			2
as something breaks , you 're like ' good grief ' and it feels like torture			0
but then a moment later the weather changes , as quickly as your mood , dolphins are jumping in front of the boat and there 's the most amazing sun -- it 's just a very serene , meditative experience			2
" @entity190 is not done with solo sailing			1
his next challenge is another solo nonstop circumnavigation , but this time the wrong way -- against the prevailing winds and currents -- before returning for another shot at the @entity20 in 2016			1
for @entity190 , the appeal of such journeys is hard to explain			1
" i remember ( fellow sailor ) @entity289 saying , ' you ca n't really understand it if you 've not done it			0
' i did n't really get that until i did it			0
unless you do , you wo n't either			0
" the record for a solo nonstop circumnavigation is a formidable 57 days , 13 hours and 34 minutes set by @entity296 in 2008 -- the fastest @entity20 completion , by comparison , was at the 2012 - 13 staging when @entity300 came home in 78 days , two hours and 16 minutes			1
yet another @entity18 , @entity303 , is now seeking to beat @entity296 's milestone -- having aborted his fourth attempt last month , he is back on the water trying again in his 31 - meter maxi - trimaran			1
will he break it ? " it 's a phenomenal record , " says @entity37 , " but @entity303 is a very experienced sailor , and is certainly a guy capable of doing it			1
the target 's tough right now but that 's the joy of records -- they 're there to be broken			2
" if he does so , what next for @entity318 and the rest of the world 's solo sailors ? if you have to ask , it would seem , you clearly do n't understand .			1

@entity303 is the latest to attempt to break the record for solo circumnavigating the globe
@entity37 was the first man to do so nonstop , calling it " where i 'm happiest "
" @entity331 " @entity3 *insists* there is no danger as safety comes first
@entity38 's @entity190 faced a *gargantuan* *uphill* struggle in his solo sailing bid
