" over the past six months , it has become increasingly clear that strong winds of change have begun buffeting this country and affecting all of us , and some leaders in media , politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at @entity1 and to engage in constructive problem - solving as well as to contribute positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day and to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible , " @entity2 said during his 7 p.m. broadcast			1

" all of us will miss his appetite for big ideas , the megawatt smile and larger - than - life presence he brought to our newsroom , and we 're grateful to have known and worked with him over the years			2

" @entity89 ' full statement about his departure from @entity1 those issues , he added , are defined in the public arena " by partisanship and ideology rather than by rigorous , empirical forethought , analysis and discussion , " and he vowed to work to change that			0
