" according to our intelligence information , four of the five terrorists are still in @entity12 and one of them has fled to @entity49 , " he said			0
while @entity21 did not immediately link sunday 's killings to the remaining suspects from the group of 15 , he did tie the group to a deadly attack on a @entity55 as well as two other incidents			2

" @entity131 -- who also met this week with survivors of the church siege , as well as @entity141 -- also said it was important that @entity3 felt secure in @entity12 , and that they remained there			2
" we should n't tolerate @entity3 leaving @entity12 , " the @entity132 minister said			1
