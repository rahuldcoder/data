you answer it and find a long - dead loved one at your front door , apparently come back to life and looking just the same as the day they died			1
how would you react ? that 's the idea behind @entity11 's debut novel , " @entity12			1
" in the hands of an author such as @entity16 or @entity17 , this could be the start of something scary , but this is no zombie tale			0
inspired by a dream in which his late mother visits him , @entity11 tells a personal story about one family caught up in a worldwide event			1
" @entity12 " is set in a small @entity26 town and focuses on an elderly couple , @entity28 and @entity29			1
a government agent shows up at their home with the couple 's son , who drowned on his eighth birthday 50 years ago			1
@entity36 looks and acts the same but how could this be the @entity29 ' son ? obviously , the couple is much older and has tried to move on			0
how will this little boy fit into their lives now or be accepted in their community ? @entity36 is one of thousands being reunited with families all over the world			0
initially there 's elation , then fear and eventually hysteria			1
are these " @entity12 " a miracle or a sign of the end times ? @entity11 was almost unknown before " the returned , " but critics and advance readers are calling his first novel " eloquent " and " elegiac , " also " haunting " and " heart wrenching			1
" @entity57 's " @entity58 " entertainment snapped up the rights and is already shooting a tv series based on the novel			1
@entity62 recently listed him as one of their 10 " @entity64 : next wave " people to watch			0
as his first novel hits shelves , @entity11 , who lives in rural @entity69 , says he 's terrified and excited by his newfound fame			1
fast facts : @entity11 age : 35 hometown : born and raised in @entity73 , @entity69 , a small town of less than 700 people and one traffic light in the eastern part of the state near the coast			1
for fans of : magical realism , @entity83 author @entity82 and readers who enjoyed @entity16 's " @entity86			1
" what else he has written : @entity11 is the author of two previous poetry collections , " @entity89 " and " ... hide behind me ... " before he was a novelist : @entity11 worked for several years as a customer service representative for @entity91 , fielding complaints in @entity93 from angry customers			1
five questions with @entity11 @entity0 : what was the idea behind " @entity12 ? " @entity11 : it actually started with a dream i had about my mother			1
both of my parents have passed away , my mother in 2001 and my father in 2007			1
in the summer of 2010 , i had this dream that i came home from work one day and found my mother sitting at the kitchen table waiting for me			1
i came in and sat down with her , and we just talked about everything that had happened since her death			0
my going to college , friends that i 'd met , it was this warm kind of cathartic dream where i was able to be with my mother again for the first time in almost a decade			1
it was one of these really vivid dreams where you wake up and question whether it was real or not			1
i really expected to find her sitting on the couch when i came out of my bedroom but of course she was n't			0
that dream stuck with me , i could n't get it out of my head			1
i was talking to a friend of mine who 's also a writer and we discussed it , at some point in the conversation he said : what if that really happened and what if it was n't just her ? i wrote a short story not long after about a couple whose son returns			1
i did a reading and the crowd really seemed to respond to it			0
people came up afterward and said how it reminded them of people they had lost			0
so after seeing that strong reaction , i started writing and about a year later , i had a manuscript on my hands			0
it 's still kind of hard to believe how it all happened , but it 's been a lot of fun and i feel really special about it			2
@entity0 : this could have been a horror story , but you took a much different approach			0
why ? @entity11 : i tried to make the story as grounded as i could because i felt it was such a difficult topic to approach			1
when i was working on the manuscript i talked to a lot of my friends , their parents , people that i knew , asking them what they would do if someone they loved who had passed away suddenly showed up again			2
the responses were really interesting			0
usually people were very excited to hear about it , saying they would love to have so and so back , that it would be a really wonderful moment			0
then i would follow up with what would happen a year later , is it still just as exciting and wonderful ? sometimes the answers became really complicated			0
you had people who had changed dramatically since their loved one had passed away			2
i 'm not the same person as i was when my mother passed in 2001			2
i was 22 years old then , now i 'm a 35 - year - old adult			0
it 's two completely different mindsets			2
so as much as i love her still , i 'm much different now and that could create some friction			0
there were other people who had similar answers who had moved forward in life			0
that was the thing i tried most to carry into the novel , to be as realistic as possible			0
@entity0 : what 's behind the recent fascination in books , tv and movies with the undead ? @entity11 : it 's the ultimate mystery : what happens after we die ? if people are coming back , what does that mean to our beliefs ? the whole genre revolves around that idea as well as the emotional impact of someone you 've let go of suddenly thrust back into the equation			1
so how do you react to it ? on a national level and on a personal level , i think it 's everyone really trying to understand life and who they are versus people who have passed away			2
i think there 's a lot of self - exploration going on right now			2
@entity0 : your book is now being turned into a tv series			1
how is that going ? @entity11 : it 's going really well			1
i do n't have much direct involvement , which i 'm actually very glad about since things are so busy right now			0
i made a deal with @entity58 , @entity57 's film company , and they brought in a wonderful writer , @entity243 , who worked on @entity245 's " @entity244 , " and they 're doing a great job			1
they 're filming outside @entity249 right now			0
i 've had a chance to meet the cast , and they 're all really excited			0
i had a chance to see the pilot , and i like what they 're doing with it			0
it 's a little bit surreal , seeing the actors playing these characters who 've i had close to my heart			2
it 's like being outside of yourself for a moment			2
it 's almost like sending a child out into the world			2
it 's been fascinating , fun and a little bit scary at times			2
with all authors when you option the rights to your work , there 's a little bit of nervousness over what will happen to it , how will it come out ? but once i saw the pilot , it was so well - done , i 'm really excited about it			2
@entity0 : what kind of response have you had from people who 've read the book ? @entity11 : many of them will come up to me and talk about someone they lost that this reminded them of			1
once they finished the book , they got a photo album out and looked at photos they had n't thought about in a long time because the book really made them remember that person and brought to the forefront all the good times they had with that person			2
to me , this is the most rewarding part			0
that 's what i wanted the book to do			1
it came from a very personal place for me , so i wanted the readers to have a personal experience as well			0
i did n't want it to be just my story			0
i also wanted it to remind you to really value the time you have with someone who 's here now and realize how precious this time is			0
if the book can do that for anyone , then i 'm happy with it .			0
