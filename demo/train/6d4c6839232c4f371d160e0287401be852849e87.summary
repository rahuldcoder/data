@entity0 was inaugurated as the 35th @entity2 president on january 20 , 1961			1
the following is a transcript of his inaugural address : vice president @entity6 , mr. speaker , mr. chief justice , president @entity9 , vice president @entity10 , president @entity11 , reverend clergy , fellow citizens : we observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom -- symbolizing an end as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal as well as change			1
for i have sworn before you and @entity27 the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago			2
the world is very different now			2
for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life			2
and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of @entity27			1
we dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution			0
let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that the torch has been passed to a new generation of @entity2 -- born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace , proud of our ancient heritage -- and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed , and to which we are committed today at home and around the world			1
let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty			0
this much we pledge -- and more			1
to those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share , we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends			0
united , there is little we can not do in a host of cooperative ventures			0
divided , there is little we can do -- for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder			1
to those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free , we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny			1
we shall not always expect to find them supporting our view			0
but we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom -- and to remember that , in the past , those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside			1
to those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery , we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves , for whatever period is required -- not because the communists may be doing it , not because we seek their votes , but because it is right			1
if a free society can not help the many who are poor , it can not save the few who are rich			1
to our sister republics south of our border , we offer a special pledge -- to convert our good words into good deeds -- in a new alliance for progress -- to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty			1
but this peaceful revolution of hope can not become the prey of hostile powers			0
let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the @entity133			0
and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house			0
to that world assembly of sovereign states , the @entity140 , our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace , we renew our pledge of support -- to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective -- to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak -- and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run			2
finally , to those nations who would make themselves our adversary , we offer not a pledge but a request : that both sides begin anew the quest for peace , before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self - destruction			0
we dare not tempt them with weakness			0
for only when our arms are sufficient , beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed			0
but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course -- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons , both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom , yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind 's final war			2
so let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness , and sincerity is always subject to proof			2
let us never negotiate out of fear			1
but let us never fear to negotiate			1
let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us			0
let both sides , for the first time , formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms -- and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations			2
let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors			0
together let us explore the stars , conquer the deserts , eradicate disease , tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce			0
let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the @entity219 the command of @entity221 -- to " undo the heavy burdens ... ( and ) let the oppressed go free			1
" and if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion , let both sides join in creating a new endeavor , not a new balance of power , but a new world of law , where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved			0
all this will not be finished in the first 100 days			0
nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days , nor in the life of this administration , nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet			0
in your hands , my fellow citizens , more than mine , will rest the final success or failure of our course			0
since this country was founded , each generation of @entity2 has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty			1
the graves of young @entity2 who answered the call to service surround the globe			1
now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms , though arms we need -- not as a call to battle , though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle , year in and year out , " rejoicing in hope , patient in tribulation " -- a struggle against the common enemies of man : tyranny , poverty , disease and war itself			2
can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance , @entity275 , that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind ? will you join in that historic effort ? in the long history of the world , only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger			0
i do not shrink from this responsibility -- i welcome it			2
i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation			2
the energy , the faith , the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it -- and the glow from that fire can truly light the world			1
and so , my fellow @entity2 : ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country			1
my fellow citizens of the world : ask not what @entity2 will do for you , but what together we can do for the freedom of man			1
finally , whether you are citizens of @entity2 or citizens of the world , ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you			1
with a good conscience our only sure reward , with history the final judge of our deeds , let us go forth to lead the land we love , asking his blessing and his help , but knowing that here on @entity219 @entity27 's work must truly be our own .			0

@entity0 : " the torch has been passed to a new generation of @entity2 "
" if a free society can not help the many who are poor , it can not save the few who are rich "
" let us never negotiate out of fear . but let us never fear to negotiate "
" ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country "
