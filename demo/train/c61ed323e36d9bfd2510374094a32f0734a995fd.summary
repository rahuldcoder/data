-- for all of its expected action and drama , the new " @entity1 " boils down to an essential question : are its central characters humans , machines or something in between ? the answer may still be unclear by the time you 're done playing this fantastic game			1
this edition of the hugely popular " @entity1 " franchise was developed by @entity16 , which took over after @entity17 , creators of the first four games , split from @entity20			1
to its credit , @entity16 has retained the intense first - person shooter action " @entity1 " fans are used to but upped the emotional interplay between the iconic master chief and his artificial - intelligence companion , @entity26			1
the action begins with master chief in cryosleep and @entity26 starting to undergo rampancy , a condition for older @entity32 in which they actually think themselves to death			1
at one point , @entity26 likens it to having 1,000 arguments with herself , but she tries desperately to hang on to her sanity to help the chief , her human ally			1
the connection between these two characters makes this campaign really special			0
from the opening scene with @entity48 , the creator of the story 's super-soldier program , to its climax , the tension between humans and machines runs throughout the story			2
web series builds anticipation for ' @entity1 ' @entity26 seems more emotive than before -- a welcome addition to the character			1
master chief retains his detached , no - nonsense soldier persona for most of the campaign , but there are moments you want his helmet to come off so you can see the facial expressions you sense he 's making			1
" @entity1 " hooked me emotionally before i realized it			2
some scenes made me feel waves of despair or elation before i recognized i was mirroring the emotions in the game -- truly a sign of an immersive experience			2
the graphics of " @entity1 " are outstanding in their detailed depictions of characters and background environments			2
whether foliage for a jungle setting or the individualized movement of little bits of wreckage , each scene is treated with careful attention to the smallest element			0
characters look like live - action actors , and their movements and emotions have a realistic , almost filmlike quality			0
this technique has been used in other games , but " @entity1 " raises the bar for others to emulate			1
the voice acting and dialogue are fantastic and help pull you into the story			2
you 'll quickly hate some characters based merely on the inflection in their voice			0
( you may even wish you could shoot them in the face -- i know i did -- but you ca n't			0
) the game introduces a new character from the recent " @entity1 " web series , and i sometimes wondered if i was missing inside jokes from the related " @entity1 " books			1
but knowing the entire " @entity1 " universe is n't a prerequisite to enjoying this game			1
there are eight missions in the single - player campaign , with plenty of weapons and vehicles from which to choose			0
combat in the game seemed more strategic than the straightforward , hard - charging style we 've come to know from previous " @entity1 " titles			1
for example , using the armor 's jump - pack accessory allows players to leap up to hidden spots and pick off enemies			0
and other armor abilities allow master chief to create a floating turret , which i found great for thinning out a battlefield before wading in			1
do n't worry , fans -- the big action sequences are still there			0
" @entity1 's " epic fight sequences require players to confront waves of enemies in one mission , then pick off bad guys one by one in another			2
and of course , co-op and online multiplayer action is available if you want to include a friend or try your luck against an opponent			0
despite all the mayhem , what stood out for me about " @entity1 " was the story			1
the new developers made an effort to delve into the characters we 've known over the years and morph them into something fresh			0
the " man or machine " question becomes more prevalent as the game progresses , and i found myself looking at different missions and scenes through that lens			0
is @entity26 more human as her mind begins to splinter ? does @entity171 , the solder we know as master chief , become a robotic killing machine ? or have both influenced each other so much that the differences we expect between the two become mixed , creating a symbiotic relationship that only becomes evident when one side lets down the other ? during one tense scene , master chief tells @entity26 , " i was supposed to protect you			1
" she replies , " we were supposed to protect each other			0
" the deepening interactions between these two main characters enhance the narrative and make " @entity1 " a wonderful new addition to a beloved franchise -- and the best " @entity192 " campaign so far			1
it keeps me wanting to play over and over again			0
" @entity1 " is available now throughout most of the world and will be available thursday in @entity195 as an @entity197 exclusive title			2
it is rated m for mature due to blood and violence			0
online interactions are not rated			0
this review was done with a provided limited edition copy and is solely focused on the single - player campaign .			0
