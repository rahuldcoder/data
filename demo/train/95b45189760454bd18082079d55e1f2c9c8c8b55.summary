you 're just arguing about paperwork , " the congressman said			0
finally , with intervention from several agencies and the @entity67 , the embassy approved humanitarian waivers , or paroles , for the 14 children			2

that plane could not land in @entity16 on saturday and instead was rerouted to the neighboring @entity165 , it said			0
another medical supply flight was diverted to the @entity165 on sunday , causing a 24 - hour delay in delivering aid that had to be transported by truck as a result , the group said			0

the airport handled 180 flights monday , none of which were delayed , lt. gen. @entity177 told @entity2			0
one @entity158 flight was unable to land over the weekend , he said , because another aircraft 's departure was delayed			0
instead of circling and burning fuel , the plane landed in the @entity165 , he said			0
" and clearly , we wanted that field hospital on the tarmac , " @entity177 said			2
" but beyond landing them on the main runway and shutting down the entire airport for a couple of hours , there were n't many options because of the design of the airfield			0
" @entity177 added that planes turned back " a number of times " and " quite a bit " in the first few days after the quake			0
