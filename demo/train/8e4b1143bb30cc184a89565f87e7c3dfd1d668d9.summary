-- the construction of what would be @entity4 's tallest building has hit a snag following the appearance of a number of mysterious sinkholes in and around the neighborhood where it is being built			1
residents of @entity13 's capital are alarmed by the increasing incidence of sinkholes -- depressions , measuring up to several feet in depth and diameter , which have suddenly appeared around @entity4			1
the first one was discovered in june , and since then several others have appeared , local media have reported			0
now , in a climate marked by increased safety concerns , the construction of a huge skyscraper in the city has come under scrutiny			1
last month , two holes within a couple of meters of each other were discovered near the @entity32 in the @entity34 district of the capital			0
several examples of this unexplained phenomenon have occurred near the site of the @entity39 , a half - constructed commercial and office development by @entity13 conglomerate @entity42 which , when completed , will be the sixth tallest tower in the world			1
holes have appeared in at least two streets in the @entity47 district , where the new tower is being built , including a 50 centimeter ( 20 inch ) wide hole only half a kilometer ( a third of a mile ) from the @entity39 construction site			1
so far , authorities are baffled			1
" we do not know the cause yet , " a police officer told the @entity53			0
" in cooperation with @entity57 and @entity58 , we investigated the problem and only found that the holes have nothing to do with sewerage			0
" a lake near the site , which appears to be shrinking , is also cause for concern			0
water levels have fallen about 70 centimeters ( 27 inches ) , although @entity67 , a spokesperson for @entity42 , told @entity0 that it would be " nearly impossible " for the water to drain into the tower 's foundations due to a slurry wall between the lake and the construction			1
the spokesperson also said that the company was looking into the mysterious sinkholes			0
" we are working on an investigation of sinkholes but it will take some time to figure out what 's going on , " she said			2
she said that academics and engineers from @entity42 have told the construction company that the sinkholes are not related to the site but it is " necessary to figure out what is going on " to provide assurance for the public			2
plans for the 555 - meter ( 1,821 - foot ) , 123 - story tower were first put forward almost two decades ago , but planning permission was slow in coming , due to security concerns from a nearby military base			0
construction of the tower , designed by @entity97 firm @entity96 , is underway and more than half of the tower 's floors have been completed			2
the architecture firm was , at the time of press , unavailable for comment			0
professor @entity105 of @entity108 's @entity107 was a consultant on the project , completing an " outsider 's evaluation			0
" he told @entity0 that the foundations of the building were solid , and that @entity4 had no history of subsidence			1
" people found sinkholes near the building site , ( and ) since there is a small lake , they are worried about the robustness of the foundation of the building			2
" however , recently many sinkholes were found here and there in @entity4			1
furthermore the foundation of the building is deep and is sitting on the deep hard rock			0
thus in my opinion there is no problem ( with ) the structural safety of the building			2
" he said that it was unlikely that the @entity4 municipal government would halt construction without reasonable cause			1
the safety concerns over the building come months after the country was shocked by the sinking in april of the @entity149 ferry , which led to widespread criticism throughout @entity13 that safety was not a priority			1
almost 300 people , mostly teenagers on a school trip , died when the ferry capsized			0

appearance of mystery sinkholes around @entity4 have authorities baffled
holes near construction of the @entity39 , the world 's 6th tallest building , have led to a *review*
following april 's @entity149 ferry *tragedy* , safety has become a focus in @entity13
