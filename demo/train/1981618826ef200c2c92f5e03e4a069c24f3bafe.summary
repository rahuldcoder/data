-- on sunday , 49 decapitated bodies were found on a major highway outside @entity3 , @entity4 , which is about 80 miles southwest of the @entity6 border			1
a large banner draped over the corpses had a threatening message from one cartel to another , in an area of @entity4 where the @entity13 and the @entity14 have been fighting for some time			1
" 100 percent @entity23 " was painted in black graffiti on a wall at the entrance of a nearby town , indicating @entity4 's paramilitary - trained cartel had committed another atrocity on a stunningly large scale			1
a day after the massacre , banners purportedly signed by the @entity13 appeared in various parts of the area , denying they were the killers			2
four days later , no information about the victims has been released			0
it 's a mystery who killed them and why			2
the only thing that 's clear is that the people who live near the crime scene seem detached , said @entity4 - based journalist @entity37			1
he has covered the drug war for more than a decade			1
that 's increasingly how many @entity4 act , he said , an understandable coping mechanism when you live in a country battling a drug war that has killed more than 47,500 people in six years			1
opinion : @entity4 must look inward @entity0 talked with @entity37 to get his observations and impressions of what 's going on			1
parts of this interview have been edited for clarity and length : @entity0 : you were in @entity3 and went to the town , @entity55 , near the crime scene			1
@entity37 : the frightening thing about this incident is the lack of reaction from @entity4 society and @entity4 authorities			1
you would expect that for an incident of this scale , that the military would be all over the place			0
two days afterward , in the center of [ @entity55 ] , there were no soldiers i could see			0
there was cartel graffiti in front of the town hall			2
all around the town , you see graffiti names of @entity80 ( @entity14 )			2
and you do n't see the authorities around			2
@entity0 : the people in @entity55 , what did they say to you ? @entity37 : the people i talked to are saying , ' why is this happening ? it does n't have anything to do with @entity55			1
this has nothing to do with us , ' which seems like a rejection of responsibility , a kind of denial			0
some psychologists say that repeated exposure to trauma causes denial and apathy , a rejection of what has happened			0
in @entity3 people are quite numb			1
perhaps parts of @entity4 feel that collectively			1
when you had the @entity3 casino fire which killed 52 people in 2011 , there was an emotional reaction to that			1
when 72 migrants were found slain [ on a @entity116 farm in 2010 ] , there was a reaction			2
@entity0 : what does this latest mass killing say about the drug war in the bigger picture ? @entity37 : i do n't think you can say this incident is a turning point			1
the drug war escalated significantly in 2008 to levels we 'd not seen before , and in 2010 to levels we 'd not seen before			1
we 've had several more years of horrific atrocities			0
so this just seems like one more among so many			0
@entity0 : what about efforts to identify the bodies ? [ on wednesday @entity4 authorities said they 're asking for dna samples to help with this			1
] @entity37 : it has been worryingly slow			1
i mean , 49 people just disappearing ? do n't they have families ? are n't there people out there missing them ? there are no reports of mass disappearances			1
perhaps they were related to trafficking but maybe they were n't			2
were they migrants [ victims of previous cartel violence ] ? we do n't know anything about the physicality of the victims			1
did they have any tattoos that could help answer those questions ? you 'd think there 'd be some physical space where [ the killers ] decapitated and dismembered these people			2
they must have left trails			0
@entity0 : logistically , it 's incredible to think about how 49 people were killed and then transported out to a major highway			1
you said this area where the bodies were found is considered dangerous but what specifically is it like ? @entity37 : this happened in the @entity176 in an industrial area of @entity3			1
the bodies were left directly on a major highway that runs toward @entity180 and the @entity6 border			0
the area has been under dispute between the @entity13 and the @entity14 , and it 's dangerous for that reason			2
a lot of journalists are fearful to go to the outskirts of the area			0
@entity0 : you went to the crime scene , and you 've been to hundreds of other crime scenes covering the drug war			1
how do police secure crime scenes in @entity4 , and in particular , how does one secure a crime scene in which 49 bodies have been decapitated ? @entity37 : in many cases , @entity4 authorities do not secure crime scenes well			1
you can get close to the bodies in many cases			0
in this case , the military and the police secured the area and covered it			0
the first calls came around 2:30 a.m. in the morning sunday			0
the press in @entity3 first became aware of it around 4 a.m. because it 's a dangerous place to go and because it was the middle of the night , the press wanted to get five or six vehicles to go there in a convoy because of the danger of driving into a hostile area at night			2
so by the time the press got there , it was 5 a.m. , the area was covered and the road was blocked			0
cameramen could not see the corpses or verify information about the corpses			0
it took until about 9 or 10 p.m. [ to process the bodies and remove them ] ... the only thing we saw was a video that seems to show the killers , which appears to be authentic			0
@entity0 : you 're talking about a video posted on the @entity232 that you viewed and you say appears to be authentic			0
why do you say that ? @entity37 : because if you look at a photograph of a pile of human corpses , [ you know when ] it looks real			1
it corresponds to this incident			0
if you watch the video -- some of it is very dark -- you can see it appears to be authentic			0
as a journalist , you ca n't [ be ] 100 percent or know who put it there [ on the @entity232 ]			2
@entity0 : @entity4 president @entity249 belongs to a party called the @entity251 and was elected in 2006			2
he declared war on the cartels and sent the military fanning out across the country , and he fired hundreds of corrupt police officers			2
some say that his actions fueled the violence with the cartels fighting back harder and more creatively			0
in july , @entity4 will hold a presidential election			2
@entity249 can not run again because of term limits			0
the party opposite @entity249 's -- the @entity263 -- could take power			0
how would the @entity263 in power change the drug war ? @entity37 : unless something extraordinary happens , the @entity263 are overwhelmingly in front in polls and are going to win			1
so far , the @entity263 have signaled some quite positive signs for the drug war by having concrete goals of reducing rates of homicide , kidnapping and extortion			1
so they are doing something other than having a broad goal of defeating the cartels and reconquering territory			0
the @entity263 has said these are the anti-social crimes we want to reduce			0
it 's also possible that the @entity263 could have a majority in @entity285			0
if that happens you could have a more powerful government that could bring together different police forces			0
one huge problem in @entity249 's administration is that you had different police forces in different states fighting each other rather than working together .			0

people in town near massacre seemed numb , detached from violence , journalist says
@entity37 : there has been little emotional reaction to *weekend* massacre of 49 people
crime likely wo n't mean a turning point in @entity4 's drug war , reporter *suspects*
