this may turn into much more than just a political scandal			1
it may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time , but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put @entity10 gov. @entity9 in the middle of a serious legal stew			1
and the fire underneath it is just beginning to heat up for the @entity16 presidential hopeful , as the state assembly plans to post online 907 pages of documents related to the case friday			1
state lawmakers questioned one of @entity9 's allies on thursday , a former state official implicated in the scandal			1
so far , @entity26 has repeatedly refused to answer , invoking his @entity27 right against self - incrimination			0
what we 've learned from document released the legislators charged him with contempt for his lack of cooperation			0
but the dam could eventually break as lawmakers dig in their heels , analysts say			0
as long as @entity9 was telling the truth at a marathon press conference he held on thursday , he should be able to step out of the caldron , analysts who spoke with @entity43 say			1
for nearly two hours the high - profile governor , who gained national recognition for his response to superstorm @entity52 , answered questions from journalists , divulging many details			0
" he was pretty specific about what he knew and when he knew it , " said @entity43 analyst @entity58 on the lead with @entity60			2
but if any of it does n't jibe with other peoples ' stories , information provided in documents or clues that pop up , experts say @entity9 could get dragged into civil and criminal lawsuits			1
the legislative inquiry into the alleged misdeeds that led to the traffic jam on the @entity74 is just getting into gear			2
what happened to begin with ? it was september and @entity9 was full steam into his re-election bid -- which he won two months later			1
@entity26 , who @entity9 appointed to a high position at the @entity82 and @entity10 , ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the @entity74 in @entity87			1
it held up motorists trying to make it into @entity91 and caused days of massive traffic jams in @entity87 , where the @entity94 mayor @entity93 had declined to endorse @entity9 for re-election			1
democrats speculated that the mayhem was political retaliation against @entity93			1
hearings ensued , and @entity26 resigned under pressure			0
then came wednesday 's revelation that a top @entity9 aide , @entity103 had e-mailed @entity26 before the closures , telling him , " time for some traffic problems in @entity87			1
" " got it , " @entity26 replied back			0
he e-mailed a comment that the parents of children stuck in school buses in the traffic jams were @entity94 voters			2
@entity9 fired @entity103 after the scandal broke			1
possible prank , sure , but something to sue over ? this was no fun and games for people who sat tormented for hours in traffic and missed important appointments , legal analyst @entity121 told @entity43 's @entity122			1
" it was utter chaos those days			2
people were pouring into the store , complaining , " @entity127 recalled thursday in her shop , @entity129 , in the town of @entity87			0
" the bridge is a lifeline here			0
you take away the bridge , you take away our livelihood			0
" that makes it a legal matter , @entity121 said			0
" the law looks backwards and says : what causes these harms ? " he said			0
one group of residents from @entity148 , where @entity87 is located , has already filed a class - action civil lawsuit against @entity9			1
they want to be compensated for alleged wages lost , when they arrived late at work			0
was a crime committed ? a woman died at the time of the mayhem , and emergency workers trying to get to her to save her complained that the traffic jams slowed them down			1
@entity93 thinks there should be a criminal investigation into the incident , saying it put " folks in absolute danger			0
" his @entity94 colleague , @entity10 state sen. @entity165 , agrees but takes it a step further			1
he called for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman 's death			1
" endangering people 's lives -- that 's not politics			2
that 's why the @entity180 attorneys have to get involved , " he said			2
@entity182 spokeswoman @entity181 , said it 's " reviewing " whether federal laws were violated			2
but @entity186 's family does n't seem to want to press charges			2
she was 91 when she went into cardiac arrest , and her daughter @entity189 told @entity43 affiliate @entity190 that she did n't think the traffic was to blame			2
" i really do n't think so , no , i really do n't			0
i think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got ( to her house ) , " she said			0
but @entity186 was not alone			0
paramedics red - flagged " unnecessary delays for emergency services " to the mayor on the second day of the lane closures			2
legal analyst @entity121 thinks a crime may have indeed been committed and prosecutors could land convictions against @entity26 , @entity103 and anyone else implicated , " particularly if they can demonstrate if the woman died as a result of the traffic jam			1
" @entity9 says he did n't know anything about this			1
how could this get him ? if @entity9 's close associates are prosecuted or convicted , it could lead them to turn on @entity9 , @entity121 said			1
thursday 's press conference was the longest and most candid in @entity9 's career , @entity10 public radio reporter told @entity60			1
" this is absolutely extraordinary , " he said			0
@entity9 offered a lot of information to back up his claim that he knew nothing			1
at the same time , he may have given investigators fodder to work with , but also a lot for @entity26 and @entity103 to contradict , should they open up to lawmakers who questioning them			0
" they may very well want to save themselves and say , ' wait a minute ; do n't believe what the governor said , ' " @entity121 told @entity122			0
@entity26 may have pleaded the @entity27 initially , but that 's normal in the beginning , @entity228 told @entity43 's @entity231			0
" you do n't want your client testifying until he has seen all the documents available			0
" but things could change			0
if lawmakers decide to go after @entity9 , they could offer @entity26 -- or @entity103 , if they question her -- immunity			2
they could decide to save themselves at his expense , @entity228 said			0
anyone @entity9 fired may also try to get revenge .			2
