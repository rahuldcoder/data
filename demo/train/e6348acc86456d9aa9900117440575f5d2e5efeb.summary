sometimes things happen that propel a palm to your head			2
you just ask aloud , " really ? " with the brightest of spotlights on the @entity6 -- and its handling of domestic violence issues threatening to tarnish the shield that represents the most profitable and popular sports league in the country -- you 'd think the nation 's pro football players would be on their best behavior			1
so , it sparks a little incredulity when -- on the heels of five players ' arrests , the indefinite suspension of a premier running back and the deactivation of two of the @entity6 's biggest stars -- yet another @entity6 player is alleged to have exacted violence against loved ones			1
as women 's groups demand change from the top down -- and one group is demanding the ouster of commissioner @entity35 and flying banners over stadiums that say , " @entity39 " -- the bad news kept piling on the @entity6 on wednesday			1
@entity40 walked off the @entity42 ' practice field and into the backseat of a @entity45 police cruiser after multiple allegations of felony assault			1
it was the latest public relations debacle for the @entity6 , as @entity40 brought the total number of players facing domestic violence or child abuse charges to six , after july incidents in which police say he broke his wife 's nose with a head butt and punched her in the face			1
here is a quick look at those players and their travails			2
@entity63 one of the top players in the @entity6 , he left the @entity65 on wednesday to deal with child abuse accusations in @entity67			1
@entity63 had been deactivated by the @entity65 and missed sunday 's game , then reactivated monday			2
but the team said it needed to correct its mistake and deactivated him again			2
@entity63 then took a leave of absence and @entity35 placed him on the exempt list , which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues			1
at no point has @entity63 been suspended			2
@entity78 the @entity80 ' defensive star also took a leave of absence because of legal troubles			2
as with @entity63 , @entity78 will be paid while he is away from the team			0
@entity78 was convicted by a judge in july on misdemeanor assault charges			0
he asked for a new trial in front of a jury , which is scheduled for mid-november			0
@entity78 played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the @entity6 grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues			1
he has proclaimed his innocence of the charges , which were filed after police said he assaulted his then - girlfriend and threatened to kill her			0
he was sentenced to 18 months of probation and received a 60 - day suspended sentence			0
@entity40 the most recent player to be arrested , the running back is alleged to have assaulted a 27 - year - old woman and an 18 - month - old child			1
sgt. @entity103 , a @entity45 police spokesman , said it would be reckless to identify the victims			0
@entity40 , 25 , spent wednesday night in the @entity107 , and the @entity42 deactivated him			1
@entity103 said neighbors reported two incidents in july			0
@entity40 posted bond and was released from jail thursday after a judge set a $ 25,000 " cash - only " bond and required him to wear an electronic monitoring device and abide by a curfew			1
he wo n't be able to take part in any team activities after his release			0
the woman did n't allege any violence until last week , when she called from another state , where she had moved with the child			0
the most serious of six charges were three counts of assault , one of which caused a fracture			0
@entity130 's attempt to reach his agent was unsuccessful			2
@entity133 the running back without a team is appealing his indefinite suspension by the league			0
while @entity133 has called punching his future wife in the head and knocking her out " inexcusable , " he is seeking to have the opportunity to play in the @entity6 again			1
the players ' union has complained that @entity133 did n't receive due process from @entity35 , who suspended him in june to a two - game ban , then increased the penalty to an indefinite suspension			1
that came earlier this month after @entity148 posted a video that showed the punch			0
@entity133 was three days away from completing the original suspension when the indefinite ban was handed down and when the @entity153 terminated his contract			0
@entity155 on august 31 , three days after @entity35 created an @entity6 policy against domestic violence , @entity156 49ers defensive tackle @entity155 was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence			1
the new policy imposes a minimum six - game unpaid ban for first - time offenders and up to a lifetime ban for second - time offenders			0
no charges have been filed in the incident involving @entity155			0
neither the team nor the league has levied any discipline in the case , and the starter at left defensive tackle played the first two games of the season			0
@entity178 the @entity181 practice squad player 's arrest went practically overlooked outside of the @entity183 area			1
according to @entity185 's " @entity186 " tracker , he was arrested on september 4			2
@entity178 was charged with simple assault after a woman told police he pulled her off a bed at a hotel , causing a head injury , @entity187 reported			0
he pleaded not guilty , @entity194 said , adding that the player was still practicing with the team			2
@entity6 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story '			1

@entity40 's arrest is the sixth of late after he allegedly broke his wife 's nose
the @entity6 has seen several of its players appear in *mug* shots
groups are demanding change ; one calls for ouster of commissioner @entity35
