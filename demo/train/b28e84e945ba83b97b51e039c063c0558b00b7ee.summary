-- historical tensions and overreaction on the part of both @entity6 and @entity7 contributed to a five - day conflict between the two in 2008 , a @entity2 fact - finding mission concluded in a report released wednesday			1
@entity12 mourners at the grave of a relative killed in the conflict on the first anniversary in august 2009			2
" the conflict is rooted in a profusion of causes comprising different layers in time and actions combined , " said the report from the @entity18 in @entity7			1
" while it is possible to identify the authorship of some important events and decisions marking its course , there is no way to assign overall responsibility for the conflict to one side alone			1
they have all failed , and it should be their responsibility to make good for it			0
" @entity7 launched a campaign against @entity12 , a @entity6 - backed separatist @entity7 territory , on august 7 , 2008			1
the following day , @entity6 tanks , troops and armored vehicles poured into @entity12 and another @entity6 - backed breakaway @entity7 territory , @entity45 , advancing into @entity7 cities outside the rebel regions			1
a total of about 850 people were killed on all sides , the report said , and untold numbers of others were wounded or went missing			1
about 100,000 civilians fled their homes , and about 35,000 have been unable to return			1
" the fighting did not end the political conflict , nor were any of the issues that lay beneath it resolved , " the report said			2
the political situation after the end of fighting turned out to be no easier and in some respects even more difficult than before			0
" @entity6 and @entity7 each blamed the other for starting the conflict , and accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting , including ethnic cleansing			1
@entity73 has since recognized @entity12 and @entity45 as independent regions			0
but relations between @entity7 and @entity6 are at an " all - time low , " the report notes			1
after five days of fighting , a peace deal was brokered by @entity80 president @entity79 , acting on behalf of the @entity2			0
an implementation effort followed on september 8			0
the report noted that the actions " stood in contrast to the failure of the international community , including the @entity86 , to act swiftly and resolutely enough in order to control the ever - mounting tensions prior ( to ) the outbreak of armed conflict			1
" @entity7 armed forces shelled the @entity12 capital of @entity94 the night of august 7			2
while that action was seen as the start of the armed conflict , " it was only the culminating point of a long period of increasing tensions , provocations and incidents , " the fact - finding report said			2
" indeed , the conflict has deep roots in the history of the region , in peoples ' national traditions and aspirations as well as in age - old perceptions or rather misperceptions of each other , which were never mended and sometimes exploited			2
" any evaluation of the conflict should take that into account , along with mounting tensions in the months and weeks leading up to it , the report said , as well as " years of provocations , mutual accusations , military and political threats and acts of violence both inside and outside the conflict zone			0
" it has to consider , too , the impact of a great power 's coercive politics and diplomacy against a small and insubordinate neighbor , together with the small neighbour 's penchant for overplaying its hand and acting in the heat of the moment without careful consideration of the final outcome , not to mention its fear that it might permanently lose important parts of its territory through creeping annexation , " the report said			0
the fact - finding mission was established in december by the @entity2 to investigate the conflict			0
it was headed by @entity147 , a former @entity148 special representative for @entity7			0
the @entity2 said in a statement it welcomed the report and hopes its findings can contribute to future international efforts at " preventive diplomacy			0
