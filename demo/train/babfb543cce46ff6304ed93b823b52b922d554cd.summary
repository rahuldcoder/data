@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 prime minister @entity4 will discuss @entity7 , whose leaking well has caused the worst oil spill in @entity11 history , when he speaks by phone with @entity11 president @entity13 this weekend , @entity4 's office at @entity5 said friday			1
it will be a " routine call " and @entity7 will be one of several issues they discuss , @entity5 said , without providing more information			1
the phone call follows concern about @entity21 rhetoric from @entity13 and others in @entity11 about @entity7 's role in the disaster			1
@entity0 mayor @entity25 said the remarks are " slightly worrying " and @entity27 , a @entity6 tv host and former newspaper editor , said @entity13 seems to be on " an absolute witch hunt " against the @entity7 boss			1
" you know , accidents do happen , " @entity27 told @entity2 's " @entity33 " on thursday night			2
" there are major issues in terms of safety here , in terms of environmental tragedy that 's going on where this spillage is occurring , but i think simply to demand the guy 's head on a plate when he 's trying to fix it is not sensible politics , and it 's slightly self - serving			0
" and i , if i was @entity13 , would cool the rhetoric			0
i would n't make it a @entity6 thing , because @entity7 is not a @entity6 company anymore , they are an international company			2
and it 's looking to me a little like @entity55 - bashing			1
" @entity25 told @entity56 on thursday he wants to see " cool heads and a bit of calm reflection " about the problem , " rather than endlessly buck - passing and name - calling			1
" he said many @entity6 pension funds are exposed to @entity7 and could be at risk if the company 's share price plummets			2
" i do think that it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great @entity6 company is being continually beaten up on the international airwaves , " he said , adding that the disaster is the result of an accident that @entity7 is trying to remedy			1
" @entity75 ( @entity7 ) can not be faulted because , i 'm sorry , it was an accident that took place , and @entity7 , i think , is paying a very , very heavy price indeed			0
" @entity13 said earlier this week that he was talking with experts about the oil disaster so " i know whose ass to kick			1
" @entity11 rep. @entity83 , @entity84 , who sits on the @entity85 , said @entity7 was probably lying in its comments about the spill			0
" here 's a viewer 's guide to @entity7 media briefings : whenever you hear someone with a @entity6 accent talking about this on behalf of @entity7 , they are not telling you the truth , " @entity83 told @entity92 this week			2
" i think we as a government have been giving them too much credence for the things they 've been saying , " @entity83 said			0
" just about everything they 've said at some point has turned out to be wrong			0
so every time they say they 're doing something , your first instinct should be , it just ai n't true			0
" @entity114 spokesman @entity113 denied thursday that @entity13 or the @entity11 is " @entity6 - bashing " and said it would probably be a topic the president discusses with @entity4 on the phone			1
he said there are certain to be " ripple effects " as @entity11 demands that @entity7 live up to its responsibilities to clean up the spill			0
" the @entity6 people understand the frustration and anger that the @entity11 people are seeing in this , " @entity113 said			0
" it is not going to affect our relationship between the @entity11 and @entity6			0
" @entity113 said the @entity11 understands " the importance that @entity7 has within @entity6 society and the @entity6 economy ... but this is ultimately about a private company and its responsibility in light of what 's happened in the @entity136			2
