@entity0 , @entity1 , concluding a four - month assignment here for the @entity6			1
but today , instead of packing , i 'm assisting with the relocation of 1,259 people facing death threats in the @entity12 neighborhood of @entity0 , the capital city			1
i arrived here on @entity14 for an emergency humanitarian mission and quickly became a witness to the formation of enclaves like this one , where residents fear for their lives			0
since december , nearly one million people in @entity1 have fled their homes amid brutal attacks and reprisals by warring factions -- chiefly the @entity27 and @entity28 militias			1
more than half the country 's 4.6 million people are now in need of humanitarian help			1
but few are in graver danger than the people trapped in numerous neighborhoods like @entity12			1
i first visited one of these enclaves in late january , when i travelled to @entity39 in the country 's northwest			1
passing through @entity43 peacekeepers , i entered a corner of the town where several thousand people had sought refuge			1
i could see it in their eyes , in their posture and most of all in their alertness to everything happening around them			0
in @entity12 i hear similar stories of people displaced from their homes and then trapped during their flight to safety			1
the humanitarian community is aware of 15 places where entire communities are currently at risk , though their numbers and locations are in continuous flux			0
some have been evacuated , as with @entity39			0
some have fled on their own , taking enormous risks in becoming refugees in neighboring countries			1
and some have fled into the bush , like the people from @entity78 , midway between the capital and @entity39			1
when i met them in mid-february , they were in a desperate state , fearing for their lives after a month in the bush			0
still others , as in @entity85 , west of @entity0 , have become imprisoned in their own homes			1
each of these besieged communities faces distinct circumstances , and holds its own views			0
the people in @entity85 want to stay in @entity85 , where many of them were born and raised			2
but they also demand freedom of movement : the right to go outside their neighborhood , a small area that would fill only a few city blocks			2
they 're not just seeking a sense of normalcy and human dignity -- this is about pure survival			0
a couple weeks ago , @entity28 fighters killed two women from @entity85 when they went beyond the bounds of their neighborhood to gather food in a nearby forest			0
some members of the @entity78 community have returned , while others have fled to different enclaves			2
a fragile agreement there allows for coexistence , but there is a constant threat of outside interference from @entity28 groups in neighboring villages			0
but despite the harrowing conditions in @entity85 , there is also reason for hope			0
vulnerable members of the @entity85 community -- as well as those who have not been targeted but are also living under a constant threat of the @entity28 and have been displaced from their homes -- are trying to neutralize a minority of spoilers to open up room for discussions			2
but hope is harder to find in other enclaves , each of which has its own dynamics and characteristics			0
the humanitarian community looks at each situation separately , and for months we have been fervently trying to identify the best way to protect these individuals ' fundamental rights to physical security and to provide the means for their basic survival			2
the international forces have been critical , but we have also been grappling with a steadily ticking clock and the stark reality that people can only survive so long in such conditions , both physically and psychologically			2
we also need to defer to the views of the community			0
in the case of @entity12 this past weekend , people were demanding assistance to safely leave for more peaceful parts of the country			2
as i interact with members of the community , many of them frighteningly frail , i ask myself : did we wait too long in accepting relocation , a measure of last resort ? and i wonder : will they ever be able to return to their former homes in and around @entity0 ? right after the convoy departs , belligerents pillage the mosque in @entity12 , underscoring the enormous challenges for future returns			1
but even more revealing , perhaps , is an exchange with three young children			0
as they follow me after leaving one of the trucks , i encourage them to return to their mothers			0
they respond , " @entity184 , we are @entity1 , not @entity185			1

one million people in @entity1 have fled their homes to avoid *ethnic* violence
@entity192 's *ousting* of @entity194 **president** last year *plunged* *car* into chaos
rebel group 's leader *seized* power *briefly* , but *stepped* down after failing to halt violence
mayor of capital city @entity0 is now interim **president** , but situation remains tense
