@entity0 , @entity1 -- a gay couple challenging proposition 8 in federal court monday said civil unions and domestic partnerships are n't the same as marriages , something they view as a stepping stone toward starting a family			1
" [ it 's ] like putting a twinkie at the end of a treadmill and saying , ' you can only have a bite , ' " testified @entity13 , one of the plaintiffs			1
" and you want the whole thing			2
... all i want is to be married			1
" @entity13 and his partner , @entity24 , are among plaintiffs asking chief judge @entity26 of the @entity27 in @entity0 to issue an injunction against the enforcement of @entity1 's @entity4 , arguing the ban on same - sex marriage is unconstitutional			1
if allowed to marry his partner , 36 - year - old @entity24 said he would finally feel equal and complete			0
" i 'd be able to stand there as one family , as a married individual , " @entity24 said , noting the " pride that one feels when that happens			2
" during testimony , attorney @entity37 asked @entity24 why he believed marriage was a better option for same - sex couples when compared with domestic partnerships and other arrangements states have for same - sex couples			1
" domestic partnership would relegate me to second - class citizenship , maybe third - class -- and that 's not enough , " he said			2
@entity24 and @entity13 of @entity50 , @entity1 , are joined by @entity51 and @entity52 of @entity53 , @entity1 , in the court challenge			1
@entity24 said he believes it 's an important step to be married before having children , saying it would make it easier for the couple and the child and would afford the child additional protections			1
being married and wearing a wedding ring sends a message to society , he said			2
" it says to them , these individuals are serious , " @entity24 said			0
" they 're committed to one another			0
" another attorney for the couples , @entity70 , argued to the judge that a ban on @entity4 leaves gay couples out of something available to all other people in the @entity78			1
" marriage is central to life in @entity78 , " @entity79 said			2
" it promotes mental , physical and emotional self			0
it 's the building block of family , neighborhoods and community in our society			2
" proposition 8 , @entity79 said , ended the dream of marriage for same - sex couples , which includes hundreds of thousands of @entity1			1
the state , he said , " has put people into categories			1
" " you 're different , and we 're going to take away that right from you , " @entity79 said , interpreting the meaning of the ban			0
" ... that 's discrimination			1
" however , @entity104 , an attorney representing @entity105 , the group that came up with @entity4 , told the judge in his opening statement the purpose of marriage is to promote procreation between men and women			0
same - sex marriage " will likely lead to very real social harm ; it 's too novel and experimental , " he argued			1
californians " are entitled to make this critical decision for themselves , " he said , pointing to voter support of the proposition			0
except for the issue of marriage , gays and lesbians have been successful in attaining policy goals , @entity104 said , adding that @entity1 has some of the most comprehensive protections in the nation			1
about 100 protesters against the measure and in favor of same - sex marriage gathered peacefully outside the courthouse before the hearing , waving signs supporting equal rights			0
the case will likely head to the @entity78 @entity138 no matter the outcome			0
it is expected to set legal precedents that will shape society for years and result in a landmark court decision that settles whether @entity78 can marry people of the same sex			0
in legal circles and across the @entity148 , it has been dubbed this generation 's @entity149 , the case that led to the @entity138 decision that outlawed segregation in schools			0
some say it could be the biggest ruling since @entity156 , which tackled abortion			0
it also closely echoes the @entity138 case that overturned bans on interracial marriage			0
@entity2 's @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			0
