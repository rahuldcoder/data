@entity0 -- president @entity2 said wednesday he was unaware of any disclosure of classified information from the scandal engulfing former cia director @entity6 and gen. @entity7 , the top @entity8 commander in @entity9 , that could damage national security			1
" i have no evidence at this point from what i 've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security , " @entity2 said in his first post-election news conference			1
@entity2 , addressing the ongoing controversy for the first time publicly , said @entity6 tendered his resignation because his actions " did not meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the @entity27			1
" the former four - star general admitted last friday that he had had an extramarital affair with a woman who was later identified as a co-author of his biography			0
the @entity35 is also investigating @entity7 over his contacts with another woman whose complaints about anonymous , harassing e-mails led to the discovery of the @entity6 affair			1
when asked if he should have known about the investigation into his former @entity27 chief earlier , the president said he is " withholding judgment " because all of the information is not yet available			0
" i 'm going to wait and see ... how this whole process unfolded , " @entity2 added			1
the scandal has threatened to complicate @entity2 's focus on critical negotiations with @entity52 over spending cuts and taxes			1
it has also raised questions surrounding the @entity27 's response to congressional inquiries into the september terror attack on the @entity8 diplomatic mission in @entity61 , @entity62 , that killed four @entity8 , including ambassador @entity63			1
on that matter , @entity2 offered a fierce defense of @entity67 ambassador @entity66 , who has come under scrutiny for public comments in the days following the attack in which she placed blame for it on a mob enraged by an @entity75 video			1
the president said @entity77 was speaking with the information provided by the intelligence community and has acted with " skill , professionalism , toughness and grace			0
" in response to statements wednesday from sen. @entity86 and sen. @entity87 , who said they would block a potential @entity77 nomination for a @entity91 position , @entity2 said if the lawmakers want to " go after somebody , they should go after me			1
i 'm happy to have that discussion with them			0
" " for them to go after the @entity67 ambassador , who had nothing to do with @entity61 and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received , and besmirch her reputation is outrageous , " he said			1
on another pressing foreign policy issue , @entity2 said he was not ready to arm the @entity106 opposition movement , saying that the nation needed to avoid indirectly providing weapons to groups or people who would seek to harm @entity8 or @entity112			1
the @entity8 is supporting a new coalition of @entity106 dissidents and is seeking to accelerate assistance in their effort to force @entity106 president @entity118 to leave office			0
on budget matters at home , @entity2 opened the door to compromise regarding the impending fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts			1
the president said he was encouraged by recent comments from members of the @entity129 surrounding the need for more revenue from the wealthiest @entity8 as part of a plan to reduce the deficit			2
" both parties voted to set this deadline , and i believe both parties can make these decisions together ... in a balanced and responsible way , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 stood by his previous statements about tax rates			2
he called on @entity142 to agree to @entity144 - passed proposals that would extend current tax rates for those making $ 250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher levels for those making over that amount and insisted he would not accept a lower tax rate for the wealthiest 2 % of @entity8			0
his comments should not come as a surprise , he said , given his statements during the election			0
" i 've got one mandate to help middle class families and families working hard to get into the middle class , " @entity2 said			2
he specifically referenced a letter he received from a man in @entity162 who said he did not vote for @entity2			2
the voter said he was watching @entity2 's comments recently on @entity1 about the fiscal cliff and said his hope " is that we can make progress in light of personal and party principles , special interest groups , and years of business as usual			1
we 've got to work together and put our differences aside			0
" after reading from the letter , @entity2 added : " i could n't say it better myself			2
that 's precisely what i intend to do			0
" the president is often criticized for not forging relationships with @entity52 , to the detriment of his agenda			0
on wednesday he acknowledged that history and said he can " always do better			0
" his relationships have n't " always manifested itself in the kind of agreement i 'd like to see between @entity186 and @entity129 , " he said			0
@entity2 is set meet with major @entity190 following his news conference , some of whom flexed their political muscle to defeat @entity186 in elections last week			2
he is expected to find backing for some of the administration 's positions ahead of negotiations with @entity52 on avoiding the fiscal cliff			1
leaders of the largest companies have indicated they are holding back hiring and spending because they are worried about @entity0 gridlock over the fiscal cliff			1
the president sat down tuesday with labor leaders and the heads of six independent groups involved in organizing grassroots support for progressive causes and told them that he intended to allow the @entity216 - era tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity8 while preserving them for middle - income earners , according to several people at that meeting			0
" the president was very strong on saying there 's going to be an end to the @entity216 tax cuts one way or another , " said one participant who requested anonymity to discuss the off - the - record meeting			0
@entity2 is to meet with senate majority leader @entity230 , minority leader @entity231 , house speaker @entity232 and minority leader @entity233 at the @entity234 on friday			2
the president took on two other issues that he has said he will address during his second term : immigration and climate change			2
an increase in the @entity242 vote that helped him win battleground states , created an opening , @entity2 said , to pass comprehensive immigration reform , something he and members of @entity52 failed to pass during his first term			1
he expects a bill to be introduced soon after his inauguration in january , adding an agreement should address border security and pathways to citizenship for thousands of illegal immigrants if they go to college or serve in the military			1
@entity2 also reaffirmed his belief that " climate change is real " and is " impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions			2
" he said it could be tackled if members of both political parties are prepared to make some " tough political " decisions			0
the last time @entity2 held a full - blown news conference at the @entity234 , his first campaign rally was two months away and former @entity270 sen. @entity269 looked to have the upper hand over @entity272 in the @entity129 presidential primaries			2
to be sure , in some ways the political landscape has changed dramatically since @entity2 fielded questions from the @entity234 press corps on march 6 : he is now assured of four more years in the @entity278 and can claim fresh leverage in his dealings with @entity129 over reaching a budget deal			0
but in many ways , the political environment closely mirrors what it looked like eight months ago : @entity129 remain in control of the @entity288 , the @entity129 leadership maintains it is opposed to any measure that will raise tax rates on the nation 's top earners and the president 's approval rating remains stubbornly stuck around a less - than impressive 50 %			0
moreover , with election - year politics having largely rendered @entity52 unproductive over the past year , many of the same issues remain at the forefront as they did the last time the president held a formal news conference -- namely the ballooning national debt , the tepid economic recovery , unrest in the @entity304 and the specter of a nuclear @entity306			0
to be fair , @entity2 has taken the national media 's questions in other forums since his march news conference , most recently in late august when he made an unannounced stop at the regular @entity234 briefing in the midst of the heated campaign and a week before the start of the @entity316			1
but he only took four questions that day and the entire session lasted less than 30 minutes			0
moreover , the president ran for re-election while largely ignoring @entity234 reporters in favor of local outlets and entertainment shows			0
pressed on why he was n't taking more questions from national media outlets , @entity2 campaign aides said the president could reach more battleground voters via local news than through network television programs or national publications			1
fiscal cliff headache for middle class those interviews were largely filled with predictable softball questions , though it should be noted that one @entity339 news anchor drew wide praise for aggressively questioning the president over conflicting @entity234 accounts in the aftermath of the @entity61 attack			1
the president also showed a preference for more light - hearted forms of media during the course of the campaign , granting interviews with comedians @entity352 and @entity354 , daytime talk show " @entity356 , " and @entity358 's @entity357			0
again , @entity2 aides stressed the president was likely to reach more undecided voters through these programs than traditional news shows			1
but critics , including some who are part of the very press corps @entity2 appeared to be ignoring , questioned whether the president was attempting to dodge more hard - edged questions			1
indeed , @entity234 press secretary @entity369 was asked last week if the president 's more or less avoidance of the @entity234 press corps over the last eight months showed a " certain amount of disdain " for them			0
" absolutely not , " @entity369 replied			0
the president was out there campaigning for re-election and giving interviews daily to reporters ... from news organizations across the country , from regional newspapers and television stations , and answered a lot of tough questions			0
" poll : public concern over effects of the ' fiscal cliff ' @entity391 and @entity392 contributed to this report .			1
