@entity0 -- justice @entity2 is marking his two decades on the @entity3 in his characteristic low - key manner			1
his former law clerks are organizing a reunion , a chance for him to get back in touch with his " kids , " as he calls many of the young lawyers who served the prestigious one - year job under him			1
he is prepared for the court 's new term , having spent the summer as he always does , touring the country in his 40 - foot - motor home , with his wife @entity18 alongside			1
and there was a recent teaching stint at the @entity21 , where he remains a big @entity23 football fan , although he was never a student there			0
all seems good for the 63 - year - old jurist , a sharp contrast to the tumultuous weeks of his october 1991 confirmation hearings			2
the nationally televised drama delved deeply and embarrassingly into his private life , a spectacle that helped usher in an escalating focus on the federal courts -- and the often nasty politics that play out to this day			0
" like the @entity39 confirmation hearings before them , the @entity2 hearings were built on the flames of ideological fights , " said @entity34 , a prominent appellate attorney and founder of @entity36			1
" he was regarded as extremely conservative , which he is , and liberal progressives were really very bent on trying to block him from getting on the @entity3			0
they failed initially and then , when the @entity49 allegations came out , the whole process exploded			0
" for an institution that values continuity and experience , justice @entity2 now enjoys a professional renaissance of sorts , becoming a key behind - the - scenes force on the right - leaning bench			1
" there are obviously some who agree with the mark that he 's left and others who disagree , " said @entity59 , a former @entity60 solicitor general who has argued several cases before @entity2 and the court			1
" but i think one thing is certain , and that is that he has left an important mark on the law			2
" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ sources close to him say the memories of his wrenching @entity75 confirmation in october 1991 are not forgotten by any means , but the experience , they say , has given him a greater appreciation of the unique role he now occupies			0
the @entity81 , @entity82 , native was nominated to the high court by president @entity85 to replace an icon -- justice @entity87			1
there were concerns raised by both @entity90 and @entity91 over whether @entity2 would become the ideological opposite of the civil rights legend , since he had barely a year of judicial experience before being tapped for the @entity3			1
many people may not remember there were actually two @entity98 hearings for @entity2			1
the first session went pretty much to form , and with little judicial record to go on , lawmakers found little about which to criticize the nominee			0
she was a lawyer who had been hired by @entity2 to work in the @entity104 and later at the @entity105 , which he headed in the @entity106 years			1
she claimed @entity2 made sexually suggestive comments on the job , which @entity49 considered sexual harassment			1
in stunning nationally televised testimony , the poised @entity49 offered lurid details and called @entity2 ' alleged actions " behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the court			1
" many senators offered both sympathy and skepticism to both @entity49 and @entity2			1
he received the final word , telling the committee , " this is a circus			0
it 's a national disgrace			2
it is a high - tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves			2
" he was confirmed 52 - 48 , the narrowest margin for a high court pick in a century			1
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for most @entity60 , @entity2 slipped into virtual anonymity after he took his judicial oath			1
he shuns interviews and rarely speaks during arguments			0
in fact , he has gone five years without speaking when cases are presented in the public sessions			0
that concerns some private lawyers , including those who count @entity2 among their friends			1
" i wish , candidly , he would ask the lawyers questions , just to give us an opportunity to at least say something about him , " said @entity140 , who has argued 72 cases before the high court			1
" because there almost invariably are issues in argument that are not briefed in the case , so you feel as though , in one sense , an important participant is kind of marching on a parallel path that 's completely removed from your efforts and advocacy			2
" but those close to the justice say you do n't know the real @entity2			1
" @entity2 is known as being quiet and taciturn , and has n't asked a question in years , " said @entity161 , a 2007 law clerk who remains close to him			1
" he 's actually an incredibly ... great storyteller			0
he could talk for hours very easily			0
if you do get into a conversation with him , it 's normally a very long and engaging process			0
" behind the closed marble hallways of the court , @entity2 is well known for his booming voice , hearty laugh , and friendly manner			1
colleagues say they are amazed he seems to know every one of the several hundred employees by their names , as well as their families and their problems			0
he shatters the mold in many ways , and is especially close friends on the court with justice @entity182 , whose views are considered liberal			2
the two can often be spotted on the bench whispering in each other 's ears , sharing an occasional laugh			2
" there are a lot of people who do n't like the fact that he breaks their expectations , " @entity189 said			0
" they expect him as an @entity196 to be toeing the liberal line , and he 's his own man			0
you know , he 's his own man among conservatives			0
he 's not following @entity201 , he 's not following chief justice roberts			2
he 's going to do his own thing			0
and the people who might expect him to follow their lead are going to be disappointed			0
" doing his own thing has often meant @entity2 is a lone dissenter in cases big and small , in issues ranging from state - federal authority to executive immunity and government regulation			1
the consistency of his conservative views has earned him a quietly influential power base among his colleagues , which only recently has begun to attract public notice			0
" in several of the most important areas of constitutional law , @entity2 has emerged as an intellectual leader of the @entity3 , " wrote @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity218 , in an essay for @entity220			1
" since the arrival of chief justice @entity226 in 2005 , and justice @entity227 in 2006 , the court has moved to the right when it comes to the free - speech rights of corporations , the rights of gun owners , and potentially , the powers of the federal government ; in each of these areas , the majority has followed where @entity2 been leading for a decade or more			1
rarely has a @entity3 justice enjoyed such broad or significant vindication			0
" but criticism -- personal and professional -- has not gone away			0
the latest complaints : calls from liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups for @entity2 to pull out of deciding a monumental appeal over president @entity247 's signature accomplishment , health care reform			1
twenty @entity91 lawmakers on thursday formally asked the @entity250 to investigate the justice 's appearances before conservative groups , and his failure over the years to publicly disclose about $ 700,000 of his wife 's income , as required under federal law			1
" to believe that @entity2 did n't know how to fill out a basic disclosure form is absurd , " said rep. @entity258 , @entity260 - @entity259 , on behalf of her colleagues			1
" i can not determine guilt or innocence , but i can request that the government do our due diligence in investigating a situation that strikes me , and many members of @entity270 , as suspicious			0
" but even liberal activists say there may be little to force @entity2 himself to pull out			2
" it 's really almost entirely self - enforced , " said @entity274 , president of the @entity275			2
" so recusal motions , if there is one filed in his case , go directly to @entity2			2
and there 's really no process for his colleagues or anyone to second - guess the decision whether he should recuse or not			2
so it really is his decision			0
" many colleagues wonder whether going his own path in life has been worth it for @entity2			2
sources close to him say he admits being concerned about his legacy , but more interested in doing his job as he sees fit , and ultimately being comfortable with the result			0
writing in his 2007 autobiography , the justice said his life was " the story of an ordinary man to whom extraordinary things happened			0
putting it down on paper forced me to suffer old hurts , endure old pains , and revisit old doubts			0
... rightly or wrongly , i have an abiding faith that my story will be important to someone			0

justice 's former law clerks are arranging a reunion of his " kids "
he is enjoying a professional renaissance of sorts on the right - leaning court
he is known for not asking questions from the bench and for going his own way
" @entity2 has emerged as an intellectual leader , " says @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity218
