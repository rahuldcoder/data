-- high - quality , high - definition videoconferencing is coming to the living room , but consumers should expect to pay top dollar for it			1
today not one but two major technology companies will be announcing new videoconferencing products for the home			1
@entity10 , which already has a well - established telepresence line of products for large companies , and @entity14 , which makes webcams and other pc peripherals , each in separate press conferences plan to announce products that will bring telepresence videoconferencing to consumers in the home			1
for years , technology companies have been describing a day when grandmas halfway around the globe could dial in to a video call to watch their grandchildren take their first steps			2
loved ones separated by oceans could share in all kinds of special moments via high - quality videoconferencing that makes them feel as if they are in the same room			1
finally , the promise will soon be reality			0
as high - speed internet access and high - definition tvs become more ubiquitous , and the cost of high - definition cameras and high - end processors comes down , the time is finally right for high - quality videoconferencing technology to come to the home			1
but even with price drops on these components and the ubiquity of broadband , getting this high - quality video experience wo n't come cheap			1
the @entity50 reports that @entity10 is expected to charge $ 600 for new hardware and a $ 30 - a - month service fee for its home telepresence service			1
other news outlets cite a lower - end @entity10 solution that costs $ 200			2
if @entity10 teams up with service providers , such as @entity59 or @entity60 , it may offer the device for a subsidized price and make up the difference on monthly service fees			2
regardless of exact pricing , the home edition of telepresence will be considerably less than the $ 100,000 the company charges large companies to set up telepresence conference rooms			1
still , it may be too high for the average consumer , especially when much less expensive options are already available			2
for example , @entity74 offers free videoconferencing through its peer - to - peer service			1
people can use the @entity74 client on a computer or they can use it on an @entity82			1
@entity74 's service is already bundled into several models of high - definition tvs sold by @entity86 and @entity87 that connect directly to the @entity88			1
what 's more , later this fall @entity89 will be adding videoconferencing to its @entity93 motion controller for the @entity95 game console			2
this device also offers a camera and microphones , making it yet another inexpensive solution to the videoconferencing dilemma			1
and there are other low - cost solutions already available			2
for instance , @entity104 's @entity103 also already offers online video chat			2
cameras that can be used with @entity89 's @entity95 video chat solution and @entity74 's service cost about $ 150 a pop. even though @entity10 is n't officially commenting on its upcoming news , the company would likely argue that the price difference between what it plans to offer and what @entity74 offers comes down to quality			1
when @entity10 first introduced its telepresence videoconferencing products for the enterprise , it bet that companies would pay for a higher - quality experience that made executives feel like they were sitting across the table from their virtual counterparts			1
its enterprise telepresence business has been growing steadily since it was first introduced four years ago			0
the life - like experience that @entity10 promises with its technology certainly is not what people expect with less - expensive services from companies , such as @entity74 and @entity89			1
because the quality expectation is less , these services can get away with using the public internet , and existing processing capability on devices like a tv , computer , or game console to offer the service			0
by contrast , @entity10 is introducing dedicated hardware that will provide a much higher - quality service			1
and if reports of a @entity10 $ 30 monthly service charge are accurate , the @entity10 home telepresence service will not travel over the public internet			2
instead , it will likely be delivered over a dedicated sliver of bandwidth from a broadband provider that will guarantee a certain quality of service			0
( this is the same setup @entity10 uses to offer its corporate customers service guarantees for its enterprise - class telepresence service			2
) what this means is that @entity10 will likely offer consumers a high - end service , which would appeal to people who are willing to pay top dollar for better quality			1
and @entity74 and others may offer a less expensive option that addresses a different segment of the market			2
pricing for @entity14 's offering , which will be part of its @entity168 launch , has n't been revealed yet			0
so it 's difficult to know if @entity14 will fall in the lower - end @entity74 competitor category or if it plans to go after higher - end customers as @entity10 is likely to do			1
" we think there will be a range of products and services available based on quality , " said @entity172 , senior director of product management for @entity174			0
" this is already the case with a lot of products in the consumer electronics market			0
people expect to pay a lot more for quality and a better experience			2
" @entity174 is one of @entity10 's major competitors in the enterprise telepresence market			0
@entity174 has already been offering a home videoconferencing service of its own			1
but the company has focused on business users rather than consumers			0
its home office offerings range in price from $ 100 for a desktop software license to $ 10,000 for a hardware optimized experience			0
the difference in price is mainly dictated by the additional hardware and software necessary to guarantee a higher - quality experience , @entity172 said			0
even though @entity174 has n't yet introduced a consumer product , the company is exploring the market			0
in january , it teamed up with @entity210 to demonstrate a consumer home telepresence system at the @entity212 in @entity213			0
@entity210 's smarter - home demonstration at @entity212 included several different applications for the connected home via a cloud - based internet service powered by @entity210			1
the telepresence videoconferencing application demonstrated how @entity174 's technology could be integrated with an hd tv to make and receive video calls			0
@entity174 still has n't announced a commercial consumer product			0
but @entity172 said that ensuring higher - quality video necessitates dedicated hardware , which would drive up costs			0
" software - driven experiences work on smaller form factors , such as on mobile devices and laptop screens , " he said			0
" but when you want to ensure quality , especially on a 50 - inch screen , you 'd want to do optimization with hardware			0
" market getting more crowded even with a higher - quality service that may set them apart from low - cost solutions such as @entity74 , @entity10 and @entity14 will soon be competing in an increasingly crowded market			1
while @entity14 has competed previously in the consumer market , @entity10 has much more experience in the enterprise where cost is less of an issue			0
while it has consumer brands , such as its flip video cameras and @entity249 home @entity247 routers , @entity10 has had a harder time hitting the sweet spot in terms of pricing for its home - grown consumer products			1
for example , its @entity256 offering introduced over a year ago , which is a suite of six products that allows users to share music in multiple rooms throughout their homes wirelessly , comes in three bundles that range from $ 550 to $ 1,000 , a hefty price tag for a function some systems do for a lot less			0
