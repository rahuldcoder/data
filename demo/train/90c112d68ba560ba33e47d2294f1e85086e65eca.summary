but @entity3 sources disagree on how strongly the @entity5 were trying to push their neighbors , and there is no indication from either source @entity0 spoke to about the @entity3 government 's receptiveness to the idea			1
at the meeting between senior @entity3 and @entity5 officials april 16 in @entity24 , @entity3 , @entity5 prime minister @entity21 urged the @entity3 to draw closer to @entity5 and to @entity12 , disengaging with what he depicted as a weakened @entity8 , according to the source close to the @entity3 government			1
the meeting was first reported by the @entity27			0
the source , who did not attend the meeting but has spoken with a number of the officials who were present , said that while the topic was not the only subject discussed in the meeting , @entity21 did tell the @entity3 that @entity5 can protect them but they need to accelerate the withdrawal of @entity8 troops from the country			1
@entity21 , the source said , painted the @entity8 as a declining power , weakened economically , and in debt to @entity12			1
" what motivated @entity40 to do this is not clear , " this source said , " but the relationship with the @entity8 is at an all - time low , ( @entity3 president @entity44 ) @entity43 is very unhappy with the @entity8 , and they saw an opportunity make this point			1
" in an interview with @entity0 on thursday , @entity5 's ambassador to the @entity8 , @entity49 , described the accounts of his prime minister 's activities as a " complete fabrication			1
" " where are @entity5 and @entity3 going to go by dumping the @entity8 ? " @entity49 said			2
" the fact of the matter is @entity3 is a country that needs the @entity8 to rebuild			0
@entity5 is a country that needs @entity8 assistance			2
" @entity49 said he is expecting @entity8 secretary of state @entity59 to visit the region " in the near future			0
" the @entity62 has not confirmed the trip yet			0
" i think that @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity8 will work together , " @entity49 said			2
" secretary of state @entity59 is committed ...			0
we expect her to be in the region			0
we will be moving forward together , together , and that these stories are going to die as many similar stories died in the past			0
" a senior source in @entity3 's presidential palace also told @entity0 that the meeting did not center on a concerted effort to get @entity3 to drop its long - term partnership plans with the @entity8			1
" there is no planned effort to try to tell @entity3 that it has to leave the @entity8 as its ally			0
we are allies with and we want to be friends with our neighbours , " the palace source said			0
that source said the @entity3 government wants " to make sure no one feels vulnerable by our long - term partnership " with @entity87 , referring to @entity5			1
" of course , the @entity5 delegation had negotiations on @entity3 bilateral relations to strengthen them and they have their concerns , " the palace source added			1
in a statement responding to the @entity27 story , the @entity5 government called the assertions in the article " baseless			2
" " @entity5 fully supports an @entity3 - led , @entity3 - owned process for peace and reconciliation			2
this fundamental principle is now widely acknowledged , " the statement said			0
" @entity5 recognizes the key role of the @entity8 in promoting stability , peace and harmony in @entity3			2
" next month , the @entity8 , @entity3 and @entity5 are holding a tri-lateral meeting in @entity40 , noted the statement from @entity5			1
" the purpose of ongoing engagements with @entity3 and the @entity8 is to have strategic coherence and clarity , " the statement noted			0
at the @entity24 meeting , the source close to the @entity3 government said , @entity21 read from a prepared text -- something uncommon at such meetings , which usually are more informal			1
this was an indication , the source said , that the ideas presented had been worked on and were not just off - the - cuff comments			0
there was nothing " provocative " in the remarks , the source said , but one must read " between the lines			0
" " it tells more about relations between the @entity8 and @entity5 and how they have hit rock - bottom , " the source said , than it does about @entity5 - @entity3 relations			1
@entity5 's generals , who exert enormous influence on the government , the source said , " want to go back to the 1980s			1
" " they 're stuck in a time warp in which they think they can push back at the @entity8 and force the @entity8 to deal with them in a regional , not just national , context			0
" the relationship between the @entity8 and @entity5 has been tense in recent months , following the arrest and subsequent release of @entity144 contractor @entity143 , who was charged with killing two @entity5 men in what he said was a robbery attempt in @entity148			1
ties have also been strained over @entity144 drone strikes at targets in @entity5 , near the @entity3 border			2
several strikes have claimed the lives of what some @entity5 officials have said were innocent civilians			2
the @entity8 does not officially acknowledge the @entity144 's secret drone program that targets @entity160 militants , but it is the only country operating in the region with the capability to carry out such strikes			0
@entity0 's @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
