-- " the @entity6 is back , " the @entity0 announced triumphantly friday , as the world 's largest particle accelerator resumed operation more than a year after an electrical failure shut it down			1
restarting the @entity6 -- the $ 10 billion research tool 's full name -- has been " a herculean effort , " @entity0 's director for accelerators , @entity7 , said in a statement announcing the success			1
experiments at the @entity6 may help answer fundamental questions such as why @entity17 's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- does n't jibe with quantum mechanics , which deals with matter far too small to see			1
physicists established a circulating proton beam in the @entity6 's 17 - mile tunnel at 10 p.m. ( 4 p.m. et ) friday , @entity0 said , a critical step towards getting results from the accelerator			1
" it 's great to see beam circulating in the @entity6 again , " said @entity0 director general @entity29			1
" we 've still got some way to go before physics can begin , but with this milestone we 're well on the way			2
" located underground on the border of @entity38 and @entity39 , the @entity6 has been inching towards operation since the summer			1
it reached its operating temperature -- 271 degrees below zero @entity42 -- on october 8 and particles were injected on october 23			2
now that a beam is circulating , the next step is low - energy collisions , which should begin in about a week , @entity0 said			0
high - energy collisions will follow next year			2
the collider has been dogged by problems			0
it made headlines early this month when a bird apparently dropped a " bit of baguette " into the accelerator , making the machine shut down			2
the incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut , said spokeswoman @entity60			0
had the machine been going , there would have been no damage , but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures , she said			0
the collider achieved its first full - circle beam last year on september 10 amid much celebration			1
but just nine days later , the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the @entity6 came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine , @entity7 said			1
the faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two - thirds of an inch by two - thirds of an inch			0
" there was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident , " he said			0
now , " people are feeling a lot better because we know we 've done so much work in the last year			2
" @entity90 , professor of physics at the @entity92 , said he 's just as excited about the results that will come out of the @entity6 as he was last year and views the september 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event			1
@entity90 noted that @entity97 , the collider at the @entity99 in @entity100 , has also had its share of failures but is generally considered to work just fine			0
" it 's a horribly complicated piece of equipment , it 's not like there 's not going to be problems along the way , " he said			0
" they will surmount those problems			0
" the @entity6 will probably be in operation more than 20 years , @entity7 said			1
but it wo n't be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature			0
the as - yet theoretical @entity114 , also called " the @entity116 particle " in popular parlance , could emerge within two or three years , @entity7 said			1
evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a " super partner " with similar properties in a quantum dimension ( according to some physics theories , there are hidden dimensions in the universe ) -- could crop up as early as 2010			0
for some theoretical physicists such as @entity90 , finding the @entity114 and verifying every prediction of the @entity129 of physics would be the worst outcome			2
he wants the @entity6 to deliver surprises , even if that means no @entity114			1
" when push comes to shove , the name of the game is ' what is nature , ' and we 're not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us , " @entity90 said			0
@entity142 and @entity143 are the general - purpose experiments designed to find the @entity114 and other rare particles that have never been detected before			1
@entity146 , another experiment , will explore the matter that existed some 10 microseconds after the @entity149 , said @entity150 , professor of physics at @entity152 and national coordinator of @entity154			0
at that time , there was a " hot soup " of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero , he said			1
although they have never been directly seen , these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons , neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it			2

@entity6 restarted more than a year after being shut down by electrical fault
the full scientific *program* for the @entity6 wil probably last more than 20 years
the @entity6 will look for the @entity114 , quarks , gluons and other small particles
