@entity0 -- the president of @entity3 on thursday denied as " absurd " reports that @entity4 entered the @entity5 over the course of 10 years and massacred @entity8 refugees there			1
" if it happened , if it ever happened , that would be a problem , " president @entity10 told @entity11 on @entity13 's " @entity12			2
" " but , as far as i 'm concerned -- and as i know , and as many @entity3 know -- that it did not happen , " he said			0
but a draft @entity20 report is the latest to allege that the @entity3 military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic @entity8 in neighboring @entity5 between 1993 and 2003			1
more than 1 million @entity3 -- most of them @entity8 -- fled west to neighboring @entity5 after the @entity3 genocide of 1994 , in which an estimated 800,000 @entity4 and moderate @entity8 were killed by extremist @entity8 militia in a wave of ethnic cleansing			1
in 1996 , @entity3 invaded @entity5 in pursuit of the genocide orchestrators			1
@entity3 's stated goal during that time was to end the refugee crisis in eastern @entity5			1
but the @entity20 draft report says that the @entity3 military did not discriminate between fugitives and refugees , nor did it discriminate by age or gender			1
" the majority of the victims were children , women , elderly people and the sick , who posed no threat to the attacking forces , " it says			0
" tens of thousands of @entity8 civilians were slaughtered with knives , bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the @entity3 army and the @entity54 swept across @entity5 -- then called @entity5 -- leading to the toppling of dictator @entity57 , " the draft report says			1
" the numerous attacks against the @entity8 in @entity5 , who were not part of the refugees , seem to confirm that it was all @entity8 , as such , " it says			1
although independent researchers have documented crimes against humanity committed by the @entity3 government , the draft report is the most official and forthcoming accusation made so far			1
the draft report , which was leaked late last month , was commissioned by the @entity70			2
the @entity20 has said the final report will be made public next month			2
@entity10 has rejected the draft 's findings and threatened to pull @entity3 's peacekeeping forces out of @entity75 in southern @entity76 if the report is published unchanged			1
last week , @entity20 @entity78 ban ki - moon visited @entity79 in an attempt to mollify @entity10 and keep him from carrying out his threat			2
such accusations against @entity3 are motivated by people attempting to " create an equivalence , " @entity10 said			2
" they have been trying to say ... there are two genocides : there is one genocide of @entity4 and there is another genocide of @entity8			0
" he added , " this is nonsense ; this is absurd			0
" asked if the @entity20 was wrong in its conclusion , he said , " the @entity20 has always been wrong on the issue of @entity3 , not only in terms of statements , but in terms of actions they carried out or did not carry out when they were in @entity3 and the genocide took place			1
" he added , " they should just keep quiet			0
" but he did not deny that deaths occurred			0
" certainly , there are -- there is death when there is war , when there is a conflict			0
" the bottom line , he said , is that @entity3 is currently at peace , and the conflict is no longer an issue			0
" we have overcome the past , the tragedy , the different problems , " he said			0
" we are moving on			0
" @entity10 , who recently won a second seven - year term as president , said he will not seek a third term			0
" this is my last term , " he said , vowing to observe constitutional term limits that would bar him from running again .			0
