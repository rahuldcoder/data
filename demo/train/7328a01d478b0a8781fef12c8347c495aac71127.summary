-- a hot night in @entity1 and hipsters , dressed to kill , dance the night away			2
a dj plays in a bar in @entity5 -- one of the few areas in @entity1 where nightlife continues a few years ago this scene would have played out across the city			1
now , soldiers line the pavements and night time revelers are more likely to hear the sporadic crack of gunshots than dance music beats			0
while trendy districts of @entity1 like @entity20 are valiantly carrying on as usual , the nation 's critical political and economic situation is hard to ignore			1
" the @entity24 have this vibrance for life , this addiction for life , and the people just really want to exclude themselves from the political scene , " @entity28 , owner of @entity29			1
it is a devastating political scene culminating in the current parliamentary deadlock which has blocked the election of a new president and put the economy on ice			1
" our best export from the country is now exporting our highly educated young men and women			0
we are losing them at the rate of six to seven thousand a month , " said @entity41 , president of the @entity42			0
the @entity24 who have chosen to stay are uncertain and fearful of war			1
they are staying in and saving money in case the political situation deteriorates			2
in spite of the discouraging climate , young entrepreneur @entity28 is bucking the trend with his 961 micro-brewery			2
" we 're doing very , very well , " he said , " we 're looking very much like a lot of our counterparts to now start expanding internationally , " continued @entity28			0
but then @entity28 is not short of nerve			0
he started @entity29 -- which is named after @entity24 's international dialing code -- during the 2006 @entity61 war with @entity62			1
961 brewery is an example of the complicated economic situation in @entity24 where some industries thrive and others fail			1
construction is another industry which is booming while others go bust			1
fuelled by low interest rates and @entity75 oil money , it is growing at around 30 to 40 percent a year			2
fears of more sectarian violence and another war with @entity62 are ever present -- and they are the kiss of death for sensitive industries like tourism			0
the @entity24 are renowned for their love of a good time and @entity1 's club scene used to attract tourists and partygoers from all over the region			1
tourists from @entity90 and @entity91 used to spend as much money on @entity24 's ski slopes in the winter as on its beaches in summer			1
but recently their governments advised tourists not to travel there			0
@entity100 , @entity24 's main bankroller , has also warned its citizens to steer clear of the unstable country			1
shopkeepers are missing the custom of @entity100 and @entity106 who are known for the extravagance of their purchases and hoteliers have noticed a big drop in occupancy rates			0
according to the @entity116 of @entity118 @entity117 , losses in the @entity24 tourism sector over the past two and a half years have run to $ 2.2 bn			1
@entity24 's beleaguered industrialists have also been hit hard by the political turmoil			1
they claim they are being ruined by high , unsubsidized energy costs and war damage			0
this has meant factories have closed and workers laid off			0
" we are the @entity127 for @entity129 's sake			0
it is now not commercial to produce glass , ceramics , plastics , building materials and bricks			0
all intensive energy industries are suffering and they have no future , " @entity41 told @entity0			0
criticisms have been leveled at the @entity140 ( @entity141 ) for failing to put any measures in place to support @entity24 during this time			1
the complicated nature of @entity24 's economic situation means that relief is coming from an unexpected source -- the country 's huge diaspora			1
lack of stability may be keeping the expatriate population from returning home but it does n't stop them from sending back money -- roughly $ 6 bn a year which makes up around a quarter of the country 's gdp			2
this money can not keep the economy afloat indefinitely and the political problems must be solved before any long - term solutions can be found to the economic issues			1
@entity163 , an eminent strategy consultant based in the country thinks @entity24 must rethink even more radically than that			2
" we can not defy gravity indefinitely			0
@entity24 has to go back to basics			2
we can not function as we used to do before the war , or even 10 years ago			0
we have to change gears			0
we have to reinvent the @entity24 economy			2
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity24 is famous for its nightlife but political deadlock is wrecking the sector
uncertainty is discouraging tourists but real estate and construction are growing
it is all part of @entity24 's complex economic *landscape* -- neither boom nor bust
what can @entity24 do to solve its political problems and get ailing sectors off ice
