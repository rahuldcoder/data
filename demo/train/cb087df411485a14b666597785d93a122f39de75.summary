@entity0 -- @entity3 voters , a typically reliable bloc for the @entity5 , are now the focus of @entity7 intent on keeping their support and @entity10 who see an opportunity to pull them in after @entity15 's recent special congressional election			1
longtime @entity15 @entity5 strategist @entity16 said the election , in which a @entity10 won the historically @entity5 district , was in part a reaction to the president 's approach to @entity23			1
@entity16 said the contest served as a " liberating device " for @entity3 voters and not just @entity27 , who tend to be more socially conservative			2
" it is very unlikely he gets large portions of the @entity32 community back ; it 's too late			0
something extraordinarily miraculous would have to occur , " @entity16 said			0
" there is a general sense of betrayal that this guy just does n't understand who these @entity3 are			2
" he got his first warning , " @entity16 added			0
signs of tension between the president and @entity3 supporters surfaced before the @entity15 election and are heightened with the spotlight on the annual meeting of the @entity48 in @entity15 , in which @entity50 president @entity49 is expected to submit an application for statehood to the @entity53			1
will the @entity10 push for @entity3 votes pay off ? the @entity57 administration has vowed to veto the submission , affirming its longstanding backing for @entity23 , @entity62 's strongest @entity61 ally			1
but many @entity3 were angered over president @entity57 's may speech in which he suggested that @entity23 return to pre- 1967 borders with land swaps agreed upon by @entity23 and @entity66			1
the pre- 1967 borders refer to @entity23 's territory before the @entity69 that year , in which @entity23 captured @entity70 , the @entity71 , @entity72 and other territory from neighboring countries			1
@entity23 argue that returning to the former configuration would leave population centers vulnerable and displace settlers			0
the president 's statements were followed by an awkward meeting with @entity23 prime minister @entity81 , in which @entity81 seemingly lectured @entity57 in the @entity83 , vowing that @entity23 would never return to the 1967 lines			1
in @entity15 , @entity10 @entity86 's 8 - percentage point victory over @entity88 @entity87 in a district held by @entity7 since 1923 brought a new focus on @entity3 voters , who supported @entity57 's presidential bid by an overwhelming 78 % in 2008			1
the @entity5 loss in the highly @entity3 9th congressional district comes as @entity57 's polling numbers among @entity3 voters , nationally and in @entity15 , have declined			1
rep. @entity96 held the seat until he resigned in june after exchanging inappropriate images over social media			0
fifty - four percent of @entity3 @entity62 approved of @entity57 's performance as president in september , compared with 60 % in june and 68 % in may , according to @entity103 polling			1
a statewide @entity15 poll taken by @entity105 in august found @entity57 's approval at 52 % among all @entity108 voters and at 49 % among the state 's @entity3 voters			1
although @entity57 received a 67 % approval rating among @entity7 in the state , he garnered 49 % approval from @entity7			0
@entity114 , the @entity105 political poll spokesman , said that the president 's poll numbers " should be better among @entity3 voters " and that last week 's election proved that there are no safe districts for the president			1
" even in a safe @entity5 district , @entity57 is not safe , and therefore he clearly has his work cut out for him , " @entity114 said			0
however , he said voters are looking at the president in a vacuum instead of against a @entity10 challenger , when he is likely to fare better , and he cautioned against using the special election as a barometer for the rest of the country			1
" there are issues he 's got to work on over the next 14 months , but it 's not a crisis situation , " @entity114 said , pointing to the uniqueness of the district 's religious electorate , a third of whom are @entity27 , and the heavy role @entity61 politics played in the race			2
@entity1 exit polling says the national @entity3 vote has not surpassed 4 % of the total vote in the past five presidential elections			0
however , a higher concentration of the @entity3 population in key presidential voting states , including @entity15 , @entity151 and @entity152 , could prove important for @entity7 and @entity10 in 2012			1
@entity153 , executive director of the @entity154 , said the @entity57 administration 's policies toward @entity23 have left @entity3 " concerned " ahead of the presidential election			1
he cited the president 's criticism of @entity23 settlements , his disapproval over construction in @entity72 and the 1967 border call as reasons for the ill will			1
" because of the failed policies and the harsh criticism as it relates to @entity23 , ( @entity57 has ) got a real problem with @entity3 voters across the country , " @entity153 said , calling the @entity15 election a bellwether for the rest of the country over @entity23 and the economy			1
" i 'm confident that @entity10 will continue to make inroads in 2012 in the jewish community ... as @entity3 voters move away from the @entity5 , " @entity153 said			2
on the other side of the aisle , the @entity178 and the @entity57 @entity179 are ramping up outreach efforts			0
in an e-mail to @entity3 supporters , @entity183 , jewish outreach director for the @entity57 campaign , sought to " set the record straight			2
" " the other side is working hard to distort the president 's record , particularly when it comes to his strong support of @entity23 , " @entity183 wrote			2
" to set the record straight , it 'll be up to supporters like us who know the truth to get the word out			0
" @entity200 , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications at the @entity179 , said the @entity62 and @entity23 have stood together in " unprecedented ways " during the @entity57 administration			2
at the @entity179 on friday , @entity200 said the @entity62 has lent military assistance to @entity23 to protect itself from incoming missiles and rockets and stood up against the de-legitimization of @entity23 at the @entity208 , among other steps			0
" we 've got a very strong record of support for @entity23 that should be evident to anybody who shares our concern for the future security and prosperity of @entity23 , " @entity200 said			0
" the security cooperation is evident ; the de-legitimization efforts by us to counter those de-legitimization efforts are evident			0
" @entity220 , an outside adviser to the @entity57 campaign on @entity3 issues , said the president 's political opponents are mischaracterizing his record on the @entity61			1
" we ... need to fight back against those misrepresentations and clarify the record , " @entity220 said			0
" we 'll go through some ups and downs as events occur , but i think in the end , our belief is that his percentage of the @entity3 vote in 2012 will be very similar to what it was in 2008			0
" @entity238 , the executive director for the nonpartisan @entity239 , doled out advice to @entity7 and @entity10 angling for @entity3 support			2
@entity7 need to better explain their @entity61 positions to ensure that their support in the @entity3 base does not wane , @entity238 said			2
" they need to tell the story better , " @entity238 said			0
" do n't take your @entity3 base for granted			0
" meanwhile , @entity238 said , @entity10 have an opportunity to make inroads in the @entity3 community through an economic plan and @entity61 policy			1
" jews are multi-issue voters			0
the notion they are single - issue voters is simply wrong , " @entity238 said			0
@entity3 voters " want to have a comfort level they want to believe in their kishkas , in their gut , that the person gets @entity23 , understands it , grasps why @entity23 is important to the @entity62			2
" @entity1 's @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report .			0
