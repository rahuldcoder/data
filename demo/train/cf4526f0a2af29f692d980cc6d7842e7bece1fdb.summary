the @entity0 said monday that it was loosening restrictions on the controversial diabetes drug @entity3 " to reflect new information regarding the cardiovascular risk			1
" an advisory panel voted in june to recommend loosening restrictions put in place in 2010 , when the @entity0 limited @entity3 use to patients with type 2 diabetes who could not control their illness with other medications			1
that decision was based on studies showing an increased risk of serious heart problems in patients taking @entity3 , most notably a 2007 analysis by dr. @entity20 , a cardiologist at the @entity21 , showing a 43 % increase in heart attacks			1
the finding led the @entity0 to order @entity25 , the drug 's maker , to conduct a thorough study of its safety			0
the full results of that study , known as @entity32 , were made public in 2009			0
results from record " showed no elevated risk of heart attack or death in patients being treated with @entity3 when compared to standard - of - care diabetes drugs , " the @entity0 said in a statement monday			1
" these data do not confirm the signal of increased risk of heart attacks that was found in a meta - analysis of clinical trials first reported in 2007			1
" " our actions today reflect the most current scientific knowledge about the risks and benefits of this drug , " said dr. @entity46 , director of the @entity0 's @entity47 , in the statement			0
" given these new results , our level of concern is considerably reduced ; thus , we are requiring the removal of certain prescribing restrictions			0
" video : @entity0 restricts diabetes drug @entity3 although @entity25 said the safety data were reassuring , the study was heavily criticized by dr. @entity64 , an @entity0 scientist who reviewed the data and said the company ignored several cases of patients who suffered severe adverse effects			2
because there were multiple conflicting signals of cardiovascular risk associated with the drug , @entity46 recommended that @entity25 commission an outside independent group to review @entity32 's results			1
@entity25 chose the @entity77 to re-examine the data and held a june hearing on the results			0
the institute 's associate director , dr. @entity80 , said that it performed a comprehensive review and that its data were consistent with the record results			0
in june , some members of the @entity0 panel questioned the severity of the current restrictions and the scope of cardiovascular events caused by taking the drug			2
" i am considerably reassured ... that the magnitude of risk is not great , " said dr. @entity92 , one of the panelists who voted to modify the warning			0
he added that he thought the current warning was more severe than necessary but should not be removed entirely			0
as of june , only 3,000 patients in the @entity99 were registered to take @entity3 , according to @entity25 spokeswoman @entity100			2
that 's compared with the 120,000 patients taking the drug in 2010 before the restrictions were put in place .			1
