-- i moved from @entity2 to @entity3 right after college and stayed for 10 years			1
i instantly felt i belonged			1
no matter how small my apartment was , how little money i had or how bad the streets smelled , i was happy			1
i went to graduate school , worked , had the time of my life and became an adult			0
although i missed my family , friends and having a glass of @entity15 looking at the @entity16 , i never wanted to go back			2
unfortunately , there was one big hurdle in my @entity3 forever plan : the scholarship that got me to @entity21 had a strict rule of returning home for two years after graduating			0
that rule was to prevent brain drain : the departure of educated or professional people from one country for another , for better living conditions			0
more than that , my significant other wanted to go back			2
" no matter what " he said , " i want to build our lives in @entity2			1
" so we did -- i am writing this from @entity38 , where i have lived for almost two years now			0
the " no matter what " part he was referring to was all the reasons why people leave in the first place : lack of opportunities , political and economic instability , and oppression			0
but from afar , @entity2 did not seem to be such a gloomy option			1
the buzz was that it had become the 16th biggest economy in the world with a dynamic , young work force			0
pundits were quick to praise @entity2 as a model country : a secular @entity57 democracy with a liberal market			1
friends were going back and the ones who stayed in @entity3 were asking if they should follow whenever we got together			2
i did not see such a model country when i moved back			1
and things deteriorated over the last two years			0
i saw @entity66 's unbearable authoritarianism , his denigrating and polarizing stance , a discriminatory attitude towards anyone who is not a @entity57 or an ethnic @entity72 and no respect to anyone who is not 100 % pro his @entity76 party			2
@entity78 's 2014 report said that the @entity76 has demonstrated a " growing intolerance of political opposition , public protest , and critical media			2
" regulation against hate crimes did not recognize ethnicity or sexual orientation as separate categories			0
neither were @entity89 listed as a distinct faith community or @entity91 -- the largest ethnic minority in @entity2 , recognized as a separate ethnicity			1
as violence against women increased , the @entity94 ranked @entity2 120 out of 136 countries in its 2013 @entity98			1
@entity99 accused @entity2 of " gross human rights violations " during the gezi protests			1
i saw a complete lack of freedom of expression as @entity2 became the worst jailor of journalists in the world			1
as for my beautiful @entity38 , the city i dreamed of whenever i missed home , i saw an utter lack of sustainable urban development			0
projects like the world 's largest airport , a canal that would split the city 's @entity117 side , a third bridge and the now infamous @entity121 - era barracks in lieu of @entity123 were planned without any consideration for the ecological system or the fabric of the city			2
large scale real estate projects gentrified neighborhoods and pushed the poor out of the city			0
it was no surprise then that @entity38 ranked 117th among 221 cities in the @entity135 's urban livability index			2
the economy was not as good as it looked either : according to the @entity138 's 2014 statistics , @entity2 has the third highest level of income inequality in the @entity138 area			1
one in every five @entity2 is poor			1
i started asking myself : shall i go back , can i really live here ? then the gezi protests happened			1
a cloud of hope surrounded all of us skeptics despite the horrendous police violence we had witnessed			2
i felt alive and happy to be in @entity2 , hopeful for future			1
protesting in the streets as long as we did , i thought " i could not have lived with myself if i was in @entity21 at this time			0
" when the police cracked down the protests , the resistance reconstituted itself as political opposition in different shapes and forms			0
but the physical and political violence did not stop			0
@entity66 became more despotic as the recent corruption scandal started threatening his power ; he went as far as blocking @entity161 and @entity162			0
a feeling of depression replaced hope			0
so i started thinking again : shall i leave ? for every person who wants and is able to go abroad , there is another who would never dream of leaving his beloved homeland or one that is not fortunate enough to have the opportunity to leave even if he wanted to			1
it is hard to be trapped between your brain and your heart			0
as for me , i think i will stay for now			0
and even if my brain drains to the farthest corner of the world , i know my heart will carry my country with me , wherever i go			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1
