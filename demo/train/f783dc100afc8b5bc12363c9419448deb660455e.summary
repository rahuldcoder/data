-- after three days of horrifying images from @entity2 , february 21 brought tentative good news from the @entity5 capital			1
president @entity6 and opposition leaders @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 concluded an agreement on a political settlement			2
if it holds , it offers @entity5 a peaceful path out of the crisis that has gripped their country for the past three months			2
but the agreement is fragile			2
it will encounter opposition from within @entity5			1
indeed , protestors on the @entity21 are already calling for @entity6 's immediate removal			2
the @entity23 may try to undermine it			1
but the @entity25 and @entity26 must work to make it succeed ; it is the best bet that @entity5 now has			1
it comes at a moment when the crisis had reached the brink of chaos			0
there had been three days of violent clashes between demonstrators and police , the threat by @entity38 of a nationwide " anti-terrorist operation , " and images , splashed across the media , of @entity43 riot police firing on demonstrators			0
at least 75 died and hundreds were injured in the capital			0
the @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 foreign ministers arrived on february 20			0
their mission was bolstered by reports that the @entity26 later that day would impose visa and financial sanctions against @entity5 officials responsible for the use of force ( this came a day after @entity58 announced that it was banning visas for 20 regime officials )			1
the @entity26 foreign ministers met with the opposition leaders , then with @entity6			1
all came together for discussions that ran through the night			0
they were joined by @entity65 , the former @entity23 human rights ombudsman , hastily dispatched to @entity2 by @entity23 president @entity67			1
@entity6 and the opposition leaders reached and initialed a tentative agreement the morning of february 21			2
after the opposition leaders consulted with a council representing the protesters , the agreement was signed			0
among the key points : -- adoption of a law to restore the 2004 constitution , which will provide for more of a balance of power between the @entity79 ( @entity5 's parliament ) and prime minister on the one hand , and the president on the other			1
the current constitution favors the president			2
-- formation of a national unity government within 10 days			1
-- further constitutional reform to be completed by september			0
-- early presidential elections , to be held once the constitutional reform is completed , but no later than december			0
the agreement provides a road map for @entity5 to move forward to normalize the country 's political life			1
the result would be a greater balance in power between the legislative and executive branches of government , and between the prime minister -- who presumably will come from the opposition ranks or will be someone acceptable to the opposition -- and the president			1
it likely means that @entity6 will be a one - term president			0
his poll numbers already were severely sagging last year			0
the events of the past three months will make it all but impossible for him to win reelection in a free and fair process			0
the settlement also may mean that @entity5 will move to sign an association agreement with the @entity26			1
it was @entity6 's decision in november not to sign that triggered the initial protests ; they morphed into an expression of broader public discontent with the government corruption and authoritarian trends that have characterized @entity6 's four years as president			1
the @entity79 wasted little time in acting on the settlement			0
members cast 386 votes in favor of a proposal to return to the 2004 constitution ( a constitutional majority requires only 300 )			1
but the deal remains vulnerable			0
some in @entity6 's inner circle will see it as a threat to their personal political and economic interests ; they may seek to undo it			0
many demonstrators will question why @entity6 , whom they hold responsible for those killed , should remain in office another day , let alone perhaps until the end of the year			0
and a particularly ominous note came from @entity23			2
@entity65 joined the @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 foreign ministers in initialing the draft agreement as a witness			0
however , after reportedly consulting with @entity23 foreign minister @entity148 , he did not attend the signing ceremony and did not sign the final agreement			2
what that says about @entity154 's view of the agreement remains to be seen , but it is hardly a positive sign			0
should the agreement put @entity2 back on course to deepen its relationship with the @entity26 , expect the @entity161 to look for ways to undermine it			1
the @entity26 , whose engagement on @entity5 has often appeared frustratingly cautious , deserves considerable credit for its role			1
having foreign ministers from three major @entity26 member states in @entity2 -- backed by a threat of @entity26 sanctions -- undoubtedly helped bring the @entity5 sides to agreement			1
the @entity26 and @entity58 must now do all they can to bolster the agreement and to work with @entity5 to pursue its implementation			1
the alternative -- a return to the violence of earlier this week -- in unthinkable			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity5 's president and opposition have reached a deal to end violence
it 's fragile , says @entity182 , but it is the best deal available to @entity5 right now
the deal restores the 2004 constitution and calls for a new unity government
@entity182 : @entity23 may undermine the deal , but the @entity25 and @entity26 must work to bolster it
