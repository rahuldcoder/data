-- my dad told me real men do n't hit women			1
he believed that because men were physically stronger and mentally tougher , men had the obligation to shield women from harm			1
i did n't buy the mentally tougher part , but i did embrace the idea that men were born with a kind of wonderful genetic code that made it impossible for them to pummel any woman , least of all a woman they cherished			1
i believed this all the way through grade school and high school			2
i believed it until my college boyfriend , in a jealous rage , threw me against the wall and knocked me out			2
it only happened once , but i remember how it felt			1
i always thought i was a physically strong woman , but i could not defend myself against a man who outweighed me by 70 pounds			1
which brings me to star running back @entity26			1
when video emerged of the @entity29 player dragging his unconscious @entity31 © e from an elevator , i thought the whole world would be horrified			1
i thought the @entity34 would come down hard on @entity26			1
@entity26 indicted on assault charge i was wrong			2
@entity26 will sit out two games and pay a fine			1
it reportedly will cost the multimillionaire athlete $ 529,411.24			2
the @entity29 ' head coach , @entity40 , summed it up this way on @entity42 : " it 's not a big deal			1
it 's just part of the process			2
we said from the beginning that the circumstances would determine the consequences			2
there are consequences when you make a mistake like that			2
he 's a heck of a guy			2
he 's done everything right since			0
he 's going to have to pay a consequence			0
" ( in may , @entity26 pleaded not guilty to one count of third - degree aggravated assault and was accepted into a pretrial program for first offenders			0
) plus , come on ! the guy went to counseling and married his victim , for goodness sake			1
say what ? in a wonderfully headlined post , " the @entity76 is eight times worse than beating a woman unconscious , " the website sports.mic contrasted @entity26 's situation with that of @entity73 , a wide receiver for the @entity74 , who " is facing a 16 - game suspension ... for testing positive for marijuana ... " actually this strange kind of " justice " meted out by @entity34 commissioner @entity83 does n't bother me as much as what the @entity29 posted on their @entity87 feed			1
according to whoever tweets for the @entity29 , @entity92 herself " deeply regrets the role she played the night of the incident			1
" perhaps the new mrs. @entity92 really does feel that way , but the @entity29 ' " helpful " tweet is as tone deaf as @entity40 's @entity26 " made a mistake / he 's a heck of a guy " comment			1
@entity101 , director of legal services for the @entity103 to end @entity104 , says , " when it comes to ... professional sports , unfortunately we 're still in a male - dominant society			0
" a girlfriend or a wife , she says , " has to bend themselves down , bend herself lower , and make her partner and her love interest shine a little brighter			0
" even when her manly , wealthy , successful husband is clearly wrong			0
put more bluntly , take the blame , honey , you probably deserved it			0
i do n't say that lightly			1
after my boyfriend knocked me out , i expected my friends to rally around me			0
" he 's such a nice guy , " they told me in disbelief			0
" you must have made him really mad			0
you say some mean stuff			0
" @entity42 's @entity131 played the role of my callous former friends on his show , " @entity135			0
" he assured his audience that , personally , " as a man raised by women , " he knows full well there 's never an " excuse to put your hands on a woman , " except , that is , when you must			1
@entity131 blathered , " we also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation			0
" in other words , ladies , do n't provoke your man or he 'll deck you			1
@entity131 's colleague -- and my new hero -- @entity155 tweeted , " i 'm thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend ... i 'd hate to think what i 'd be asking for by doing so			0
" @entity131 tried to apologize , but the damage was done			0
perhaps the @entity34 will try to apologize too , but again , the damage is done			0
so , mr. @entity83 , a few facts for you to ponder for the future : according to @entity164 , one in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime			1
one - third of female homicide victims are killed by their current or former partner			0
according to the @entity173 , boys who witness domestic abuse are twice as likely to abuse their own partners and children when they become adults			1
it 's why i thank @entity179 every day i married a man whose father was as old - fashioned as mine			0
@entity182 taught his sons a slightly different version , though			0
@entity185 said , " a man who hits a woman never hits a man			2
" are you listening , mr. @entity83 ?			0

@entity29 running back suspended for two games after domestic violence incident
@entity195 : i thought men did n't attack women they loved , until it happened to me
@entity195 : in my case , as in others , the woman victim wound up getting blamed
fathers have to teach their children that violence against women is n't ok , she says
