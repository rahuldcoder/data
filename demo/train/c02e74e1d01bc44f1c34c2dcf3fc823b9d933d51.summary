it 's a national outcry			0
republicans and @entity2 have urgently pressed president @entity3 to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border -- and fast			1
but in the hours after @entity3 announced tuesday his request to @entity10 for $ 3.7 billion to slow the surge , objections began to mount on @entity12			1
the opposition is entrenched and extends beyond the current crisis of more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors crossing the border since october			2
it 's rooted in distrust of the president , especially on immigration			2
" there 's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws and it 's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes , " house speaker @entity20 said in february			0
as a central example , republicans point to @entity3 's decision in 2012 to defer deportations of children brought to the @entity32 illegally by their parents			1
they claim that 's a reason for the unexpected surge of kids today from @entity39			0
with the door closed to any action on immigration reform this year with midterm campaigning in full swing , @entity10 and @entity3 now face a crisis around that issue , which @entity27 do not want to touch as it 's politically charged and complex			1
and they 're signaling that @entity3 's proposal to address the situation on the southern border wo n't be dealt with quickly , even though the @entity51 casts it as an emergency			1
@entity3 on wednesday called the flow of " unaccompanied children " an " incredibly dangerous " situation , and said his proposal offers @entity10 " the capacity to vote immediately " on a solution if it wants to address the problem swiftly			1
@entity3 heads to @entity62 amid ' urgent humanitarian situation ' is immigration crisis @entity66 's second act ? but @entity20 said earlier on wednesday , " we 've got to do something about sealing the border and ending this problem so that we can begin to move onto the bigger questions of immigration reform			1
" @entity74 chairman @entity73 of @entity75 got to the heart of @entity27 sentiment , saying @entity3 " created this disaster " with his action to ease deportations			1
" no amount of resources or changes will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if president @entity3 continues to ignore the law , " he wrote in a statement , resurrecting the common refrain when immigration reform was still a possibility			1
republicans also balked at the size of @entity3 's request , which was twice what they anticipated			1
it includes $ 1.8 billion for the care of immigrant children while in holding facilities and $ 1.1 billion for the transportation and removal of any children ineligible to remain in the country			1
" what disappoints me so much is he 's asking for a blank check , " @entity62 sen. @entity104 said			0
fiscal hawk sen. @entity108 of @entity110 said it 's an extraordinary amount			0
" we can put them all on a first class seat to their homes , that 's $ 8 million , " @entity108 said tuesday on @entity119 's " @entity118			2
" the issue of immigration is ripe with politics , especially in an election year			1
it motivates the @entity27 base , which is skeptical of reform and despises @entity3			1
but @entity2 strategist @entity127 said @entity27 are trying to have it both ways -- ask for a solution and criticize the president			1
" they ca n't scream about the house being on fire and then cut off the water supply to put out that fire , " she said			0
the situation also plays well for @entity2			0
they have consistently and increasingly captured the @entity139 vote , and used immigration as a wedge to keep @entity142 in their camp			0
while @entity2 indicate they support @entity3 's request , they want more details before signing off			2
at least one has expressed some frustration with the @entity51 on this issue and , too , raises trust , but in a different context			2
" we just ca n't just trust the president and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want , " rep. @entity152 , whose @entity62 district is one heavily impacted by the current crisis , told @entity119			2
@entity2 want to maintain the status of current law giving youth the right to make their case in an immigration proceeding			0
" i hope at the end of the day it is basically fair and humanitarian and we keep in mind repeatedly that we 're dealing with children here , " said sen. @entity165 of @entity166			0
a law signed by president @entity173 just prior to @entity3 's swearing - in , was meant to address child victims of illegal trafficking			1
it says unaccompanied children from countries other than @entity180 or @entity181 can not be immediately deported			2
instead , they must be treated humanely , turned over to the @entity182 , and given an immigration hearing to determine if they qualify for asylum			0
5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis @entity27 want the law changed so unaccompanied youth can be immediately sent home without due process			2
@entity152 and sen. @entity104 , also of @entity62 , are set to propose legislation on thursday to reverse that measure			0
while the @entity51 says it will ask @entity10 to give the @entity197 more discretion to send such immigrants home , it 's unclear if @entity3 will request changes to the anti-trafficking law			1
@entity51 press secretary @entity202 said this week the administration would meet humanitarian and due process standards			0
more judicial resources to accelerate immigration proceedings is one step the @entity51 indicated was necessary			0
even some democrats want more information , especially regarding asylum for trafficking victims who may be fleeing abuse or life threatening situations in their domestic surroundings			0
" i want to see what is written			0
i trust this president but i want to verify , " @entity165 said .			0

president @entity3 asked @entity10 for $ 3.7 billion for border solution
republicans immediately raised concerns , especially over cost
democrats are also *wading* *cautiously* on the issue in a midterm election year
@entity3 says @entity10 can solve problem now if it wants by passing his plan
