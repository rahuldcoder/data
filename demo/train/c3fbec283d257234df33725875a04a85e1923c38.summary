-- a diet of drudgery in a takeaway might seem wholesome but it does open the eye to better things			1
one evening last week i was in the kitchen fixing myself a cup of tea when my son put his head around the door			1
i have hardly seen him since he left school last summer as he spends his days working in a sandwich shop and nights taking orders in a fast - food takeaway			1
how 's it going , i asked			1
these jobs of yours , i said			1
have they taught you anything interesting yet about or work , or life -- or anything ? yeah , he said			1
they 've taught me i like getting paid			1
see also : what can @entity30 can learn from football managers ? my question was prompted by a recent @entity35 blog arguing that humble jobs teach young people more about work than any amount of poncing around as an unpaid intern in a film production company			1
the author , who is now a law school professor , was once a busboy and a cleaner -- jobs which he says taught him lessons that have come in handy ever since			1
already i was seeing the sense in his general argument			1
my son 's first key takeaway from the takeaway restaurant was spot on : getting paid really is nice			1
it is a pity most of us get so used to it that we forget to be pleased when payday comes around			1
so what else had it taught him ? he said he 'd think about it and tell me later : he had to go or he 'd be late for his evening shift			1
this led to the second revelation : if you are earning Â£ 7 an hour you need to work longer than an investment banker to make any money at all			2
and that , in turn , led to the third : earning the minimum wage makes you grateful to live at home where there is a warm bed and full ( ish ) fridge			2
for everyone else , it is a game of survival and he does n't understand how they manage			2
later that evening i got a text from him saying the restaurant was quiet and that we could talk			2
so i went over to find the place entirely empty apart from my son , who was loafing around by the till			2
this led to his fourth revelation : doing nothing sucks			2
it 's the worst thing there is			1
it makes you so lethargic that when things get busier you can hardly bring yourself to budge			2
see also : five ways to resign in style is n't he also learning how to be professional , i asked -- leading the witness outrageously			2
and then came lesson number five : you have to be punctual			2
you must n't swear , or turn your back on customers , or answer them back			2
if you have a hangover you still have to get to work on time , and you have to pretend that you feel fine			1
listening to him recite this list led me to contribute an insight of my own : a fast - food restaurant is an excellent finishing school			0
it has succeeded in areas where 18 years of liberal parenting and seven years of hugely expensive private education have made little impression			0
yet even though he has learnt how to be civil to customers , he has not learnt to like it			0
in fact what he has discovered is that : dealing with customers can suck			0
some of them are friendly , but there are lots who do n't even look at you			0
that gets to you after a while			0
my son looked anxiously at his watch and said his boss would be in soon			0
but i thought you told me you liked him , i protested			0
in the beginning we went for a drink after the shift , but he decides how many hours i work , and he blames me for stuff like not ordering new menus , when that 's not even my job			1
so drinking with him feels weird			0
" in other words he has learnt invaluable lesson number eight : being friends with your manager is never a good idea			0
before i left him , i told him that his lessons bore no resemblance to the ones drawn by the @entity35 blogger , whose stint doing humble jobs taught him great truths about humanity : that most people want to take pride in their work , and that everyone has big dreams			1
what did he think of that ? he pointed out it was hard to take pride in your work when the restaurant is doing badly and the manager does n't care			0
see also : how millennials can score the perfect job but even with good management , some people are still useless moaners , which led him to lesson nine			1
working with whingers is rubbish			0
so what should be done about them , i asked			0
he looked at me as if i were an idiot			0
" f - ing fire them , " he said , momentarily forgetting lesson # 5			0
and what about dreams ? " yeah , " he said			0
" everyone here has dreams			0
" slightly dreading the answer , i asked what were his			0
to my relief he replied : " to get into university and to get a skilled job			0
