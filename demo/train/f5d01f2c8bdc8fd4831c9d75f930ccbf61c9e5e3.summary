i was about halfway through the marathon when i saw the man with the plastic pink flamingo			2
like me , he was jogging down a highway in coastal @entity5			2
unlike me , he had a beanie -- yes , with propeller -- perched on his head			2
i was running my first marathon , inspired by the terrorists - be - dammed attitude emanating from the # runforboston hashtag after the @entity13			1
i 'd pledged to run the race shortly after two blasts at that race in april of last year killed three people and injured hundreds			1
and i 'd asked people from @entity22 's @entity21 community to join me , documenting our yearlong journeys together online			1
more than 300 people joined the project			1
we do n't share geography or ideology , but we do share the run -- a willingness to try to do something in response to tragedy			1
the man with the flamingo was @entity36 , a marathon mini-celebrity of sorts who was running his 100th 26.2 mile race -- a feat that seemed like the most insane running - related thing ( maybe anything - related thing ) i 'd heard up to that point			1
that was before @entity36 told me two more facts : he got engaged on a marathon ; and got married on mile six of a subsequent marathon			2
kept running till the end			1
i jogged alongside him for a few minutes on that sunday in november at the @entity51 , both because i was curious and because i hoped to learn something			2
i wanted to finish the race , but was n't entirely sure i could			2
the farthest i 'd run before i started training , seven months before then , was six miles			1
i had to do a training program in order to start a for - real marathon - training program			2
plus , i 've been told that when i jog i look something like a constipated velociraptor			2
i do n't seem like the person who 's cut out for this			2
but i did n't anticipate what @entity63 would teach me			2
it 's been about a year since april 15 , 2013 , when the bombs went off in @entity67			2
i ca n't claim to understand what it 's been like for the victims of that tragedy or for their families			1
but i can tell you that people around the world , including myself , were inspired to do something personal and positive in response to that dark day			2
by running in response to the tragedy , we were n't attempting to negate the irreparable harm done to the people of @entity67 last year			1
we felt helpless in that moment , and we wanted to do something , anything , to try to process it			2
we laced up some sneakers and took to the streets			2
are you at the @entity88 ? share your photos @entity90 seemed like the movement 's online leader			2
the young woman from @entity94 started a @entity95 where people all over the world could log the miles they 'd run in honor of the victims and survivors , and in solidarity with the city			1
she encouraged people to use apps like @entity106 that donate to nonprofits as you go			0
more than 35,000 miles were logged on a @entity95 she created shortly after the blasts			0
" the day i identified myself as a runner was the day i heard about the bombings at the @entity88 , " wrote on @entity110 , 55 , a typist in @entity111 , @entity112			1
" i vowed to keep up my own training to honor the runners and fans whose races and lives were interrupted in @entity67 , " she wrote			1
" i pledged to run for those who no longer can			1
" what i realized after joining running 's enthusiastic cohort is just how much this community of individuals matters -- and how it takes care of its own			1
many runners have needed that community a little more this year			1
take @entity131 , a 24 - year - old market analyst who lives and works within blocks of the bombing site in @entity67			0
he was evacuated from his office with only a gym bag the day of the bombing , and was holed up for days at his mom 's house , unable to return to the area			0
partly because of those logistics -- no clothes other than those for a run -- and partly because he just felt like he needed to do something , @entity131 , who never had run competitively , started running through his city			1
he wanted to figure out , in a literal sense : " where 's the edge of where i 'm allowed to be ? " how close could he get to his home , which was acting as a staging post ? but he also would stretch his personal limits			0
soon he found a large group of like - minded people , out there on the streets just trying to relieve the stress of being evacuated from home and work			1
they started running meet - ups , donated to the one fund @entity67 charity to help the bombing victims -- and eventually formed a community that still exists			1
@entity131 is currently training for a half - marathon and hopes eventually to qualify to run a full one in @entity67			1
his dad died in february , and the last time he saw his father was at a @entity169 race outside @entity67 , which his dad had flown in from @entity171 to watch			0
he uploaded a finish photo with his dad and mom to @entity21			1
@entity131 took first place in the race for his age group			1
it was only after his dad died that @entity131 realized , while digging through his father 's things , that he had medals from track and cross-country races in high school , and that he had new and apparently unused triathlete jerseys			1
running became a bridge to his dad			1
and a way to cope with the bombing			0
" starting running in a really stressful time showed me how much potential running has for being a stress reliever , " he said			1
" it 's kind of a lifestyle			0
once you get into it you get pretty addicted to it			0
you feel so much better			0
" " it became a lifestyle and it became a community as well			1
" i 've encountered and read about so many incredible people over the past year			0
in april , two weeks after the @entity67 bombing , i went to @entity205 to watch @entity206 finish the marathon she started in @entity67 , but was n't allowed to complete			0
i thought of her and her teary - eyed finish when i was running my own race			1
how she met strangers along the route who helped her push through a difficult run			1
and i thought of heroes like @entity217 , a dancer who lost her left foot in the second blast in @entity67 and vowed to dance again			0
you can see her doing just that in a @entity22 documentary , " @entity224			0
" my journey is n't as meaningful as those			0
but since i 'd made the pledge , and since i 'd spent so many months training to get to that super-flat course in the coast of @entity5 , i did want to finish			1
@entity231 + tells me i logged more than 400 miles in my seven months of training ( i did n't use the app for every single run , and it 's a little glitch - prone , so that 's an estimate )			1
i 'd run 20 miles before the race , but never the extra 6.2 you need for a marathon			1
i ran up behind @entity240 , the man with the pink flamingo , hoping for tips			0
what i found was a person in crisis			0
he hid it at first , but i soon realized @entity240 was in immense pain			0
his ankle was shot , probably from the wear and tear of so many races in such a short time , he said			1
he started tearing up as he told me how dozens of his friends had come to the race , holding signs with his name and face on them , to support his 100th marathon			0
what if he did n't finish ? what if he let them down ? i know nothing about marathon running , really , and i 'd never met @entity240 before			1
but i walked beside him for a several minutes and offered any consolation and encouragement i could			0
i told him he absolutely would make it			0
he 'd already run 99 marathons			1
what 's half a marathon more ? i know from the online register that he did finish the race			0
and i want him to know he was part of the reason i did , too			0
i had to -- not just for myself but for him			0
and for all the other people who i 'd met and who helped me over the course of the year			0
even at his weakest point , he still offered me encouragement			0
it 's why he carries the flamingo , which has its own @entity286 page : magenta the @entity287			0
he hopes it might lighten someone else 's load			0
" you 've got ta try to get out there and be a positive force on the marathon course as well as in the world , " he told me			0
running a marathon is something no person can do alone			2
so you help each other			0
you run towards the blast to help the victims			2
you raise money to heal the wounded			0
you offer kind words to a stranger			0
it 's a given , just what you do			0
and when you 're around them for a while , it starts to seem contagious .			0
