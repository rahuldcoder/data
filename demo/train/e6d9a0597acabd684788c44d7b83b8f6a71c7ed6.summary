-- as far as former world champion @entity6 is concerned the key to a successful rekindling of @entity5 's @entity4 dream is a buzzword that has been flying around @entity8 faster than a @entity9 in recent weeks : stability			1
days after the country entrusted @entity13 to edge the @entity14 towards economic recovery , motorsport royalty has descended on @entity16 in the latest attempt to ignite a lasting passion for @entity5 in a country with more motorheads to the pound than anywhere else on the planet			1
while the domestic @entity25 and indycar series thrive on continued popularity , @entity5 can never claim to have set @entity14 alight , despite repeated efforts to foster a permanent place in the hearts of motorsport fans			1
that could all change in @entity33 , which has a purpose - built circuit to unveil as well as a 10 - year deal to host an @entity5 race			1
and just like @entity13 relied heavily on the @entity38 vote to propel him back to power , @entity5 are also hoping to court a new swathe of @entity4 fans , with @entity33 just 200 miles from the @entity44 border			2
@entity6 -- one of only two @entity14 ever to claim the @entity5 world title -- is convinced this latest attempt to grow the sport in both @entity47 can succeed , and mirror the success it enjoyed at the @entity51 circuit in @entity52 between 1961 and 1980			1
" i think @entity5 fans in the @entity14 can begin to rejoice , " he told @entity53			2
" i just keep saying this ; @entity5 's fan base in @entity14 is very much underestimated , but they need to have some stability which i think we will finally achieve			1
" the new facility in @entity33 is going to be a beautiful site			2
this is what the @entity14 has really needed and from here on , starting this year , i think we can look forward to the race happening every year and at a place we will be very proud ( of )			2
" the fact @entity33 is down in the southern part of @entity16 , easily reachable by @entity70 fans -- you 've got @entity44 , @entity72 , @entity73 -- many of them are fertile grounds for @entity5			2
" despite an association stretching back over half a century , @entity5 and the @entity14 have never got beyond the dating stage , enjoying an on - off relationship that has spawned 41 races at nine different venues			1
since the first race was staged at the @entity84 in @entity85 in 1959 , the @entity14 @entity82 has been through places like @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , enjoying only one true period of permanency , at @entity51			2
that 19 - year stint in @entity93 counted as the sport 's golden years in @entity14 as bumper crowds flocked to the tree - lined track , bathed in fall colors , to watch the world 's best do battle			1
@entity101 , a three - time world champion , recalls how the small town would be swamped by drivers , teams and supporters , who all congregated around " the bog " -- a patch of quicksand - like mud induced by an invasion of trucks and cars -- or the famous @entity112			1
but once the track was deemed too dangerous , the @entity113 was on the move again , even being upstaged in @entity116 , @entity117 by a camel race -- surely a low point in the competition 's 62 - year history			1
" it was a street race , and for the same reason -- the quality of the road surface -- it never lasted for very long , " @entity101 explained			0
" apparently the biggest downside was that there was a camel race on the same weekend that drew a larger crowd than a @entity5 race , which was very telling about @entity14 's understanding of @entity5			1
" had there been a @entity134 race there , or an @entity137 race , it would have been a different story			0
" @entity5 did n't fare much better at its most recent home in @entity88			0
a dispute over tires in 2005 led to a host of drop outs and a race involving just six cars , much to the embarrassment of the sport 's authorities			0
but now , with a purpose - built race track , funded by a private investor , and a decade - long commitment to race in @entity16 , perhaps @entity5 will finally get a foothold in a lucrative market which could help drive it towards a bigger and brighter future			1
@entity101 told @entity53 : " i think @entity33 , @entity16 has an even better chance , because they 're building a stadium , a @entity5 road racing stadium			1
" @entity5 needs the @entity14			2
there is a huge car market			0
i know now @entity162 is bigger , i know @entity163 is bigger and if not , going to be bigger , but the @entity14 is still huge			0
" we need to get a home there , where @entity5 could be developed , and it could be seen as the sophisticated end of @entity5 , of motorsport			0
but why should n't there be , if there 's 300 million people in @entity14 , if we just got 10 per cent of them , that 's a huge audience			0
" and when we go to a little country , population-wise , like @entity174 , we have more than 300,000 people coming for the long weekend of the @entity174 @entity82			0
and they do n't have a background like @entity14 has , of motorsport			0
" at one stage it appeared the @entity14 ' appetite for @entity5 was insatiable			1
despite @entity51 's long association coming to an end in 1981 , the following season there were an unprecedented three @entity4 races , as @entity87 , @entity89 and @entity185 all welcomed the sport			0
though that particular hat - trick lasted just one season , @entity5 supremo @entity188 is keen for a return to the glory days and is desperate to add a second @entity14 race to the modern - day roster			1
@entity195 had been included on a provisional 2013 calendar but organizers have been forced to postpone for a year as they continue to grapple with financial issues			0
@entity188 has long pined for a grand prix in the picturesque city of @entity52 , but whether a second race appears in the @entity202 or in neighboring @entity195 , @entity6 is confident the @entity14 has a sufficient appetite for two visits a season			1
" @entity14 as large as it is can easily support two races -- one would feed off the other , " he explained			2
" i just ca n't see a negative in any way			0
i know @entity188 for many years has wanted to have something in the proximity of @entity52 for obvious reasons			0
" and with the event there and the backdrop of @entity217 , it 's going to provide the ambience they 're looking for			0
i think both venues could be very attractive			0

@entity5 returns to the @entity14 for the first time since 2007 this weekend
former world champ @entity6 says stability is key to latest @entity5 venture
purpose - built track in @entity33 has a ten - year contract to stage @entity5 races
@entity101 says @entity14 can comfortably support two @entity5 races every season
