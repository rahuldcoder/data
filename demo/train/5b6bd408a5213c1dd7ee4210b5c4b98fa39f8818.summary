@entity0 -- it 's @entity0 's version of the reality television show " @entity4			0
" president @entity5 has tapped one of the country 's top military men to head the @entity9 , while the current @entity9 chief is being nominated to take charge of the military			1
the decision to send gen. @entity14 to the @entity9 and shift cia director @entity15 to the @entity16 is as much a reflection of the political skills of two talented bureaucratic infighters as it is a sign of the administration 's shifting agenda in a variety of hot spots around the world			1
faced with a looming reelection campaign and tighter budget constraints , @entity5 wants to move ahead with plans to complete the @entity29 withdrawal from @entity30 and begin the process of winding down the unpopular war in @entity33 , according to numerous analysts			0
new fiscal and political realities are contributing to a growing emphasis on smaller , more flexible , less costly , and potentially more dangerous military and paramilitary engagements in the years ahead			2
translation ? a smaller @entity16 that is more reliant on solid intelligence gathering , and an increasingly militarized @entity9 more heavily involved in armed conflicts			1
@entity15 and @entity14 are , by all accounts , uniquely qualified to manage the change			1
@entity5 shuffles familiar faces in key security roles " this team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer , " said @entity50 @entity49 sen. @entity48 , a key congressional voice on security matters			1
" i could not be more pleased with these selections			0
" the post- 9/11 wars have made @entity16 and @entity9 coordination " essential , " former cia director @entity58 told @entity1			1
" it has n't always been that smooth , but over time we 've learned from experience			0
" @entity15 , 72 , has been described as the consummate @entity0 insider			1
he took over at the @entity9 in february 2009 , and previously served as chief of staff to president @entity66 between 1994 and 1997			1
prior to that , the @entity68 @entity67 served as director of @entity66 's @entity71 ( @entity71 ) -- a position that , by definition , requires mastery of tricky fiscal situations and an understanding of the federal government 's sprawling bureaucracies			0
as of february , more than 1.4 million people were serving in the @entity29 armed forces			0
@entity15 also served in the @entity81 from 1977 to 1993 , a period in which he established deep congressional ties			2
his friendships and institutional knowledge of @entity86 will be critical in terms of helping to mold congressional opinion and balance @entity16 priorities against growing deficit fears			2
in taking charge of the @entity16 's changing missions , @entity15 will " deal with it the way he dealt with issues at the @entity9 , " @entity58 said			1
" he 'll seek the facts			0
" over the last couple of years , @entity15 has " had to make difficult decisions on which there were no easy answers , " @entity58 added			2
" that 's pretty good schooling for the kinds of decisions he is going to have to make at the @entity16 , where ... difficult choices are going to be necessary			2
" for his part , @entity14 already has an " intimacy with the ( @entity9 's ) capability , " @entity58 said			1
" he knows its strengths			0
he knows whatever shortcomings it may have			0
he knows the people very well			0
he knows what buttons to push			0
" @entity14 , 58 , assumed command of the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) and @entity29 @entity33 in july 2010 , after serving for more than 20 months as commander of the @entity119			2
he has worked with the @entity9 in helping to oversee the military 's predator drone strikes against extremists in both @entity33 and @entity123			1
@entity124 : why @entity15 , @entity14 are smart choices @entity14 also previously commanded multi-national forces in @entity30 , leading the so - called " surge " -- the deployment of more @entity29 troops and the implementation of new strategies to reverse setbacks and make strides to defeat the insurgency and end the war			1
over the years , he has retained enormous popularity and respect in the halls of @entity139			0
during his time commanding the @entity141 and @entity142 , he oversaw the development of the @entity145 / @entity144			0
@entity14 , analysts note , already has a close relationship with intelligence sources around the broader @entity149 , including @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , and a host of other pivotal countries			2
in that respect , he will have little trouble transitioning to the @entity9 's traditional role of intelligence gathering			2
one major change for the general , @entity58 notes , is that the @entity9 director typically does not make policy			1
the head of the @entity9 " basically defines the situation as it exists on the ground ( and ) informs policy , but stops short of actually recommending policy , " he said			1
" @entity14 will be moving into a job that has a somewhat less prominent policy role than the jobs he has had in the past			2
" former cia director @entity173 said a key cultural difference waiting for @entity14 is that , unlike the military , " folks at the @entity9 do n't get the hierarchy thing real well			1
he will be faced with a degree of informality with which he is unaccustomed			0
" @entity173 , however , did n't see that aspect of the transition as a particularly large hurdle			0
at the @entity9 , @entity14 will find a culture of " patriotism , service , sacrifice , ( and ) value of group before self , " he said			1
it is " a culture with which he will have great comfort			0
" @entity1 's @entity193 , @entity194 , and @entity195 contributed to this report			0

gen. @entity14 has been tapped to head the @entity9
cia director @entity15 has been nominated to lead the @entity16
@entity14 will provide much - needed leadership for an agency more heavily involved in military missions
@entity15 will likely help oversee an era of *declining* @entity16 budgets and fewer large - scale conflicts
