@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 momentum endures at the @entity5 , despite a brief reality check			1
two years on from the " @entity7 " , those in blue responded to an early blow from its @entity12 opponent to end a breathless day in prime position			2
as the sun dipped below the @entity15 in @entity1 , @entity4 carved out a 5 - 3 advantage , roaring back in an afternoon session that spoke of the continent 's deep reserves			1
that the pairing of world no. 1 @entity22 and no. 3 @entity20 scrambled desperately to grab a tie in their afternoon match , having lost in the morning , underlines the point			1
new heroes were born — rookies @entity29 and @entity30 among them — as familiar fault lines in @entity12 ranks were exposed once more			1
it was actually the first pairs session victory @entity4 had enjoyed since 2010 , and the best foursomes win in their history , after the @entity12 had secured a morning lead of 2½ - 1½			1
no wonder @entity4 captain @entity37 ended the day displaying that trademark grin of his			2
" today shows how important momentum switches are and how it can have a domino effect			0
for our guys to respond as well as they did shows a real strength of character , " @entity37 told reporters			0
" for me it 's not about two points dropped if ( @entity22 and @entity20 ) lost , but they went out this afternoon and rectified this morning -- it was probably as good as a win from where they were			1
" it 's not a perfect science , but two out of three rookies ( winning ) is n't bad			0
the afternoon rookies had great partners in @entity58 and @entity59 — there are n't better guys on your shoulders in a @entity5			2
" it 's a great day but let 's take stock — we have a big day tomorrow			0
" @entity4 fly in foursomes not a single slice of red could be seen at the conclusion of the afternoon matches , which will no doubt cause @entity37 's counterpart @entity72 a bout of introspection			1
in the morning , the rookie pairing of @entity76 and @entity77 had shot down @entity78 , nicknamed @entity4 's postman because he always delivers			1
yet after comfortably disposing of @entity78 and @entity1 's @entity81 the @entity12 pair were rested for the foursomes contests -- @entity72 later conceded the error of judgment			1
meanwhile @entity85 and @entity86 showed signs of fatigue as they surrendered their 100 % record as a pairing to @entity59 and @entity4 rookie @entity91 -- they had earlier dispatched @entity4 's gun pairing of @entity22 and @entity20			1
the one afternoon match that had seemed a @entity12 banker was the one that pitted rookie @entity96 and world no. 10 @entity97 against that gun pairing			1
two up with three to play , and with the @entity4 pair hell bent on redemption , the @entity12 's conservatism when trying to close out the match opened the door			1
@entity22 birdied 17 before an arrowing second into the 18th from @entity20 put pressure on @entity96 to hole a final putt to win the match			0
he could n't , and their opponents could breathe a sigh of relief			0
" we owed each other a lot , " @entity20 told reporters			0
" we knew we were n't playing great but fought as hard as we could and half a point is huge			0
" @entity118 support the day had begun in darkness , spectators dashing through the gates at 6am , desperate to secure a seat in the grandstand around the first tee			0
by quarter past there was n't a spare seat to be had , by half past the 2,500 strong gallery were in full voice and by the time the captains arrived on the tee , excitement was palpable			0
former @entity133 champion @entity132 and @entity135 's @entity134 lapped up the acclaim as they made the long walk from the range to the tee , through a tunnel bedecked with images of @entity5 legends gone by			1
the honor of hitting the first ball of the 40th instalment of the @entity5 fell to another ex- @entity133 champion , @entity146 , who mishit his shot , before @entity148 again encouraged ear - splitting noise from the crowd as he crunched a drive into the rough			0
the @entity4 pairing were less wayward but after a halved first hole they grabbed the initiative on the second hole and did n't let go			2
@entity134 , the 2013 @entity157 winner , proved the difference on the second hole , @entity160 the difference on the fourth — a rapier - like approach yielding another birdie			2
two more birdies , on nine and 10 , took the match out of @entity72 and @entity168 's reach , the first point of @entity1 's @entity5 secured with another birdie on the 14th			0
@entity12 fightback it did n't take long for the @entity12 to respond			2
@entity78 's " postman " tag preceded him on the tee			0
but the rookie pairing of @entity76 and @entity77 paid no heed to the @entity179 's reputation			0
despite earning the loudest cheers thanks to the presence of @entity1 's own @entity81 , @entity78 and partner fell behind on the first and failed to rally			0
a stretch of five birdies in six holes chipped away ever so slightly at @entity78 's mantle , @entity81 perhaps overcome by nerves on his own @entity5 debut			0
a victory , secured by the same 5 & 4 margin @entity160 and @entity134 had managed , answered that early @entity4 pressure			1
behind them @entity22 and @entity20 were locked in a ding - dong battle with @entity85 and @entity86 , who put their unbeaten @entity5 record on the line			1
having lobbied @entity37 for months to play together , @entity22 and @entity20 prised out a one - hole lead after the @entity198 chipped in on four			0
but by the 10th , @entity85 and @entity86 had established a two - hole lead , erased by @entity4 birdies on 11 and 13			1
another @entity22 birdie on 15 titled the balance towards the blue half but @entity86 's brilliant eagle on 16 ensured they would go up the last all flat			2
none of the four played it spectacularly , but it all came down to the match 's final blow , which @entity85 duly dispatched to maintain that winning streak for a few hours at least			2

but @entity97 and his partner @entity96 hung in , and despite going two down on the 13th , the latter — a rookie — showed firm resolve to sink a birdie putt on the last and secured a vital half			0
two of the afternoon 's foursomes matches , where players take alternate shots , were on the course before @entity22 and @entity20 had finished their morning round			2
first out were a group that had all missed the morning session , @entity179 's @entity58 — playing in his eighth @entity5 — alongside rookie @entity30 , @entity234 joining @entity235			0
the @entity12 were ahead after the third , but fell two behind on the 11th as @entity30 warmed to his task			0
the deficit was reduced on 16 , but after @entity234 fluffed a chip on the last , @entity4 secured a two up victory			0
behind them @entity160 and @entity134 picked up where they left off in the morning , going two up after six holes on @entity244 and @entity245 , both fresh after a morning rest			2
despite twice being pegged back to all square , @entity160 was equal to the test , his putting stroke proving the difference on 15 and 17 as a 2 & 1 victory made it a two - point day for the pair			1
the last match out saw another test of @entity257 and @entity86 's 100 % record , with @entity258 rookie @entity29 and @entity59 accepting the challenge			1
@entity59 , playing for the first time in the competition without fellow @entity262 by his side , played big brother to the 24 - year - old as they charged into a three - hole lead			2
despite having their lead dented twice , once on the front nine and once on the back , they scampered to the finish line to secure a 3 & 2 win and a near - perfect @entity4 afternoon			1
@entity59 , himself a @entity133 champion , ended the day by saying of his partner : " this guy is going to be the next superstar of @entity4 golf , i 'm telling you			1
" as the sun set on an absorbing first day , the pairings for saturday 's morning fourballs were announced			1
@entity132 and @entity134 will be off first again , playing @entity148 and @entity234			1
@entity58 and @entity30 are out second playing @entity235 and @entity245			0
@entity216 and @entity218 square off against @entity76 and @entity77 while @entity78 and @entity22 go off last against @entity96 and @entity97			0
