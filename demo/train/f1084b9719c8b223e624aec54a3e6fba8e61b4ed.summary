@entity0 , @entity1 -- health officials continued on monday to investigate the causes behind the mysterious deaths of 64 children in @entity1 after saying they had made an important discovery over the weekend			1
the @entity8 in @entity1 tested samples taken from 24 patients and found 15 had tested positive for @entity11 -- a common cause of hand , foot and mouth disease that can also cause severe neurological complications , mainly in children			1
" these results now give a good explanation to this outbreak , " dr. @entity15 , head of the institute 's virology unit , said in an e-mail over the weekend			1
" we will get more results hopefully by next tuesday or wednesday			0
" the @entity24 also noted that a " significant proportion of the samples " had tested positive for @entity25 , but it cautioned that the outbreak had not been fully solved , and more analysis was needed			1
outbreaks of the enterovirus " occur periodically in the @entity30 , " according to the @entity33			0
@entity34 had its first major outbreak in 2006			1
@entity36 had an outbreak in 2008			1
though the detection of @entity25 in @entity1 is significant , there may be other factors , said dr. @entity41 of @entity43 hospitals			1
over the past three months , 66 children -- between 2 and 3 years old -- were admitted to @entity43 facilities			1
all but two died mysteriously after suffering severe neurological and respiratory complications , @entity41 said			1
in their last hours of their life , the children experienced a " total destruction of the alveola ( e ) in the lungs , " @entity41 said			1
the patients also suffered from encephalitis , which is inflammation of the brain , he said			2
" we have now to see what really is causing the deadly pulmonary complication and see if a toxic factor is playing a role too , " he said			0
investigators probe mystery disease killing @entity1 children the positive test for @entity25 does not particularly help in the treatment of the illness , as there is no effective antiviral treatment for severe @entity25 infections , and no vaccine is available			1
the way the syndrome is attacking the children is " merciless , " dr. @entity72 , @entity2 's chief medical correspondent , said from @entity1			1
@entity72 noted , though , that the disease did not appear to be " clustering , " or spreading rapidly in particular geographic areas , reducing fears of a possible epidemic			1
in milder cases , @entity25 can cause coldlike symptoms , diarrhea and sores on the hands , feet and mouth , according to the journal @entity88			0
but more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain , resulting in polio - like paralysis and death			0
@entity95 ' well - developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus , but children are vulnerable to it , according to the @entity33			2
on sunday , a @entity24 ( @entity24 ) representative in @entity1 warned the new discovery " does not mean we have solved the problem of the undiagnosed cases			0
a lot more analysis is needed , and further laboratory investigations need to be done			2
" the @entity24 said that other pathogens had been detected in the investigations , including dengue and streptococcus suis			0
it added that samples tested negative for @entity112 and other influenza viruses			2
tensions have arisen between the @entity24 and @entity43 hospitals about the dissemination of information about the outbreak			2
the international organization has provided a lower death toll than the hospitals , saying sunday that 52 out of a total number of 59 children affected by the mysterious syndrome had died between april and early july			1
in his statement sunday , the hospital official @entity41 criticized the @entity24 for previously making statements to the news media " without being clear on the facts			0
" " who was telling whole the world : new mystery killer disease in @entity1 ! this was causing unnecessary panic in @entity1 , " @entity134 said			0
@entity41 has said the number of cases affected by the mysterious disease is relatively low -- 34 cases in june , compared with the 75,000 sick children at @entity43 's outpatient clinics and 16,000 hospitalized kids			2
but @entity144 with the @entity24 in @entity1 rejected suggestions that his organization caused any kind of panic			0
he said @entity41 was the one who stated , in a letter to the government , that the situation in @entity1 was " most severe			0
" " who has not made any statement about the disease , other than what we issued in the joint press release with the @entity157 , " @entity144 said			0
the ministry reported the outbreak to @entity24 through the @entity160 , which 194 nations are parties to , @entity144 said			2
" since this event fitted the criteria of being an event where the underlying agent , disease or mode of transmission is not identified at the time , @entity24 is obliged to communicate information to other member states , " he said			0
@entity25 was first isolated in @entity173 in 1969 , according to the @entity33			0
mystery illnesses : a mother 's painful quest for answers @entity2 's @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			0
