-- an @entity2 sheriff filed a federal lawsuit thursday against the owners of craigslist , accusing the popular national classified - ad web site of knowingly promoting prostitution			1
" @entity10 is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation , " says @entity9 @entity8			1
@entity9 @entity8 wants craigslist to eliminate its erotic services section			1
" @entity10 is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation , " @entity16 said			1
" missing children , runaways , abused women and women trafficked in from foreign countries are routinely forced to have sex with strangers because they 're being pimped on craigslist			0
" the @entity26 found more than 2,800 child prostitution ads posted on craigslist , with @entity28 , @entity2 , in the top 10 cities for juvenile prostitution , @entity16 said			2
the sheriff also noted instances of what he said was child neglect while parents were engaged in activity solicited on the web site			1
in an e-mailed statement , @entity10 told @entity0 it had not seen @entity16 's complaint but that " craigslist is an extremely unwise choice for those intent on committing crimes , since criminals inevitably leave an electronic trail to themselves that law enforcement officers will follow			2
" " on a daily basis , we are being of direct assistance to police departments and federal authorities nationwide , " spokeswoman @entity47 said			1
" misuse of craigslist to facilitate criminal activity is unacceptable , and we continue to work diligently to prevent it , " she said			0
" misuse of the site is exceptionally rare compared to how much the site is used for legal purposes			0
regardless , any misuse of the site is not tolerated on craigslist			0
" but @entity16 said that the web site for two years has ignored his written requests to shut down the @entity68 section and failed to take action or adequately monitor the section despite hundreds of arrests			1
" pimps are preying on the most vulnerable members of our society and taking advantage of our struggling economy , " he said			0
" the worst part is craigslist 's owners know their web site is still being used for illegal purposes and they 're doing nothing to stop it			1
" @entity10 entered into an agreement with 43 states ' attorneys general in november to enact measures that impose restrictions on its erotic services section			2
the agreement called for the web site to implement a phone verification system for listings that required ad posters to provide a real telephone number that would be called before the ad went public			2
@entity10 also imposed listing fees , requiring a credit card , for ads in the section			0
the proceeds were to be donated to charity			0
@entity16 called the fees " dirty money " and said the move was a " publicity stunt " that had little practical effect because pimps use stolen credit cards or post ads in free sections .			0

@entity9 @entity8 wants craigslist to cut @entity68 section

" @entity10 is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation , " says @entity16
