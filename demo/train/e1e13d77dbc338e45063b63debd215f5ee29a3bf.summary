-- a twisted boardwalk , a glowing carousel flooded with water and a cresting river breaching its banks			0
these are among the memorable images from @entity8 , but they were n't taken with fancy cameras -- they were shot with smartphones and immediately seen around the world via photography app @entity14			1
on the day the storm came ashore , users shared 800,000 images tagged # @entity8 on @entity14			1
at one point , @entity14 reported people were posting 10 @entity8 photos per second on october 29 , 2012			1
" during @entity8 , we saw people along the @entity25 using @entity14 to document how the storm was affecting their communities , and to let loved ones know they were ok , " @entity14 founder @entity22 told @entity0 this week			1
" as @entity8 made landfall , we saw photojournalists like @entity31 documenting in real time the storm 's path of destruction			1
in the immediate aftermath , we saw local residents like @entity39 sharing images that humanized the relief efforts in some of the hardest - hit communities like @entity42			1
" @entity39 : let 's not forget @entity8 's victims @entity14 reached a saturation point as @entity8 hit , and the platform became a storytelling medium for the storm			1
after that watershed moment a year ago , it seemed apropos to do an @entity14 - only project for @entity0 's anniversary coverage			1
@entity14 friends @entity55 and @entity56 visited families in some of the hardest - hit areas , photographed intimate portraits of people and their new homes and highlighted the rebuilding efforts along the coast			1
@entity55 is the manager of @entity0 's @entity14 account , and @entity56 is an @entity65 photographer			1
@entity0 sent @entity55 back to @entity66 , armed with an @entity67 , and the full experience was only for the @entity14 audience			1
he has 28,000 followers on his personal account and is one of @entity0 's in - house experts on the platform			1
here 's what @entity55 had to say about this storytelling experiment			2
the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			0
@entity0 has never done an original photo and video series housed on @entity14			1
why did you choose the @entity8 anniversary to embark on this @entity14 - only project ? @entity55 : @entity8 itself was the biggest event @entity14 had ever seen			1
my personal experience was that i grew up in the area , and i knew a lot of people who were documenting it on @entity14			1
the mentality of a big organization like this is that these stories and these photos need to be in a lot of places			0
we put these stories together exclusively for @entity14 , just for that platform , because we saw a lot of value in it			2
@entity108 photographers ditched their professional cameras for mobile phones to tell the story of @entity8 last year			1
what is your take on news outlets using the storytelling medium of the average person ? and , who 's doing it well ? @entity55 : @entity14 is a great spot for everyday stories			1
it started with just seeing what our own people were doing in the field			0
we have correspondents and producers out in really cool places across the world documenting everyday stories			0
for example , @entity130 , our correspondent in @entity131 , is documenting stories in @entity131 that nobody else is doing			0
it 's not always something that fits in broadcast , but there 's a lot of value in seeing that continuing story in @entity14			1
almost every week , they let someone take over their @entity14 and document where they are , whether they 're documenting something as simple as a small town in the @entity151 or a war zone in a different country , where life is very different			2
looking back at the @entity14 images from @entity8 , there were compelling , verified ones but also false ones			1
how can we tease out the real from the fake ? @entity55 : the way that we currently feature images on the @entity0 account , we 're only featuring stuff from @entity0 folks across the world and featuring images from @entity169			1
if we 're featuring citizen photos , we 're going to the team behind @entity172 and trusting how they verify photographs and stories			0
location is one thing to help us verify photos			0
you ca n't falsely tag something that 's geotagged on @entity14			1
seeing the people who it 's from is also helpful			2
if you look at their account if there 's a genuine love for storytelling , you can see it in the everyday stories they tell			2
there 's a consistency in how they shoot and tell stories			2
but with a suspicious account , you can tell because they 're posting photos of various quality			0
their feed is n't consistent			0
some journalism experts say it 's not the camera you have , but how you use it that 's important			2
how do you use the phone 's camera to your advantage ? @entity55 : for me , what i love about the mobile phone camera is this fixed - lens mentality			2
it has its own set of challenges			0
one of the best things about @entity14 is that because of the challenges of shooting on mobile , people look to tell stories differently than they would with a traditional photo outlet			2
with this project , we did some things that have become popular on the platform			0
for example , the " dear portrait " is when you hold up a physical photo from the past in a current location			0
you try to line it up with what 's there			0
you only get one photo or video to tell a story per @entity14 post			2
what are some of the ways to tell long - form stories in this format ? @entity55 : it seems like because @entity14 allows you to post as much as you want that you should post everything that you have			1
what works best is the idea of restraint : which photos tell or continue your story the best way			0
i think portraits tell a story really well even if people do n't read the caption below			0
for example , with the stories from @entity8 , i was amazed that when i took peoples ' portraits , you could see almost the whole experience of the year in their eyes			1
i did n't see that until i went back and reviewed the photos			0
this is the first of many long - form stories we 're going to tell on @entity14			1
it 's a huge success on the @entity14 platform			1
we 've got a lot of great engagement and would love to be able to tell another set of stories like this again			0
what are the limitations of working with such a small photo as a storytelling format ? @entity55 : it 's probably the detail because with @entity14 , when you 're going to take portraits , you want to get close			1
with the square format , what is in the center is the focus , so you center the persons ' eyes and face in the photo			0
there 's no ability to zoom in and out on a photo , so you 're presenting what you can in the space give to you			0
on social media , the tendency is to keep things short , yet you often write long captions on your @entity14 posts			2
what 's your rationale for long captions ? @entity55 : i start long and i reduce , reduce , reduce until i get to the story that needs to be told			0
from my previous experience in telling long stories on @entity14 , i realized people read through the long captions based on the comments they left			2
the people who follow the @entity0 account are trained to read the caption , whereas on personal accounts , people see the long caption and are turned away			2
fill in the blank : storytelling magic happens when _ _ _ _ _ _ _			0
@entity55 : storytelling magic happens when the subject is at its most comfortable , and you get their best story			0
the reason why some of these stories were so honest and so true was because they did n't feel like this huge media outlet was on them			0
they had the freedom to tell their whole story			0
we did our best to stay true to the stories .			0

for @entity8 's anniversary , @entity0 tried an @entity14 - only project
users shared 800,000 @entity14 images of the storm as it hit
photographers visited families in hard - hit areas , captured intimate portraits
