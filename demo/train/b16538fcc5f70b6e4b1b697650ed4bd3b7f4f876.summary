-- one year ago this week , @entity1 got a wake - up call about a core problem in our politics that empowers ideological extremists and special interests			1
on september 14 , 2010 , both @entity9 rep. @entity8 and @entity11 mayor @entity10 lost closed partisan primaries , depriving most voters of a chance to vote for them in a general election			1
one a @entity18 and the other a @entity17 , they both fell prey to a system that is rigged to punish political independence and that artificially polarizes @entity23 politics			1
each of their stories is worth retelling			2
one gave us @entity29 , and the other was regarded as a serious , but hopefully temporary , setback to education reform			1
call it a case of @entity35 ( @entity18 in name only ) - hunting and dino - hunting -- the results are far - reaching			2
@entity8 was a former governor and longtime @entity18 congressman from @entity9			2
he had established a fiscally conservative record as the successor to supply - sider @entity42 , balancing the budget and cutting tax rates three times			2
as a congressman , he voted against president @entity49 's health care bill , in part because he felt there were not enough medical malpractice reforms , and he voted against the stimulus bill			2
but he was centrist on social issues , a supporter of abortion rights and gay rights			2
he was concerned about the environment and climate change and was no great fan of the @entity61			2
in other words , he was no hyperconservative warrior but an excellent fit for his state , and one of the most broadly popular politicians precisely because he was center - right			0
he was consequently considered an easy pick to succeed vice president @entity69 in the @entity70 and flip the seat from @entity17 to @entity18			0
but in the @entity73 - driven purges of 2010 , @entity8 was considered a traitor to the conservative cause because he had a record of working across the aisle			0
and so they turned to activist and serial candidate @entity29			1
keep a few things in mind			0
@entity29 had just five in - state donations in the first quarter of the 2010 cycle			1
but in the third quarter , as the rino - hunting fever took hold , she received a quarter - million dollars in @entity73 national activist cash			0
a video posted by an @entity29 supporter prominently -- and without any facts whatsoever -- suggested that the married @entity8 was gay , a frequent tactic of the far right against anyone they deem a squish			1
( my favorite antecedent : then - gen. @entity98 was called " the candidate of effeminates " by supporters of conservative isolationist sen. @entity102 in their 1952 primary			0
) @entity29 , then unemployed , had previously lost two statewide races and never served in elected office			1
she was best known for being a social conservative activist , talking about her anti-masturbation policy and pre-evangelical flirtation with witchcraft on @entity111 's late - night show			0
suddenly , she was lauded as the grass - roots candidate of fiscal conservatives , parroting libertarian rhetoric that had nothing to do with her beliefs to date			0
but on september 14 , 2010 , she beat @entity8 in a closed partisan primary in which only 32 % of @entity18 voted ( and keep in mind that @entity18 are a distinct minority in @entity9 )			1
the result ? in november , @entity18 lost a @entity70 seat they were likely to win , especially in a @entity18 - leaning year			1
like @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity29 got the nomination but was too extreme for the general election			1
the @entity127 held on to the @entity70			0
extremes are ultimately their own side 's worst enemy			0
mayor @entity10 's story in @entity11 is less well known , but no less resonant			1
@entity73 primary challenges are already infamous , but left - wing challenges to more centrist @entity127 are in the process of catching up			0
and this is exhibit a in the annals of dino - hunting to date			0
@entity10 was in his first term as mayor , young and charismatic , but he alienated allies by seeming aloof and out of touch ( sound familiar ? ) some leaders in the the inner - city @entity23 community felt that @entity10 , who is also black , was not spending adequate attention on their community 's concerns			0
the real issue in his re-election , however , was his embrace of education reform , led by his controversial but nationally known schools chancellor @entity154 -- one of the stars of the education reform documentary " @entity157			0
" teachers unions are among the top donors to @entity127 campaigns			0
they expect their way to be obeyed			0
and they decided to use @entity10 as an example			0
they ended up pouring about $ 1 million into the september closed partisan primary , in which @entity10 faced @entity169 president @entity168			1
that money -- and directly linked get - out - the - vote efforts -- ended @entity10 's tenure as mayor despite a majority of residents saying that the city had improved under his watch			0
independent voters and @entity18 -- who might well have been strong supporters of @entity10 's reforms -- never had a chance to cast a ballot in this election for their mayor			1
instead , the election was effectively over before the higher - turnout general election was ever held			1
@entity154 left the school chancellorship to start a national education reform group called @entity188			0
and mayor @entity168 's administration almost immediately encountered a series of scandals , leading to near - record low approval ratings for such a young administration			0
the lesson : closed partisan primaries are fundamentally unrepresentative			1
they 're too easily hijacked by ideological activists and party hacks beholden to special interests			2
and because these local primaries are the gauntlet that candidates have to run , they lead directly to the culture of hyperpartisanship that now threatens to paralyze our capacity for effective self - government			2
the parties have forgotten that they are not the purpose of our politics			1
so here 's one reform whose time has come : replace closed partisan primaries with open primaries -- like those in @entity220 and @entity221 and many other states -- allowing independents and other candidates full access to the political process			1
that , along with redistricting reform , would help heal the harsh but ultimately artificial polarization of our politics			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

a year ago , moderates in both parties lost primaries in @entity238 and @entity11
@entity233 says their *defeats* were the result of partisanship in closed primaries
@entity29 appealed to the party base but lost the general election
@entity233 : having open primaries would go a long way to improving politics
