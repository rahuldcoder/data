-- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 's admiration for @entity5 democracy activist and former political prisoner @entity4 was hard to miss during her visit to @entity4 's home in @entity9			1
they stood together , hands clasped and all smiles -- and even shared a hug -- at a news conference friday on @entity4 's porch before international journalists			0
" i felt like i had known her for years , " @entity17 told @entity0 's @entity18 on her second day of meeting with @entity4 , " because of all of the information i had about her and the interactions that friends of mine had about her that carried messages back and forth			1
" but @entity17 's enthusiasm on the last day of her historic visit to @entity5 seemed to extend beyond her personal admiration for the @entity32 laureate , who , until her release in november 2010 , spent nearly 20 years under house arrest imposed by the country 's regime -- one that now appears to be taking steps in the direction of democracy			1
@entity17 sees signs that the country , ruled by a military junta for almost 50 years and which in the past cooperated with @entity46 in missile technology , may genuinely be opening up -- via its economy			1
" they asked that i personally follow through with a request for the @entity51 to send an assessment team , that we offer technical advice about how they can and should reform their economy , " @entity17 told @entity0			2
but the military ties with @entity46 have to go if @entity5 -- called @entity5 by opponents of the regime and by @entity3 officials -- wants deeper political and economic cooperation with @entity62 and with nearby democracies , such as " @entity64 , which has a great deal to offer in terms of development assistance , " @entity17 said			1
" @entity5 " was the name the country used decades ago , before the military junta took control and changed it to " @entity5			1
" as @entity46 still looms in the background , the @entity73 administration is not ending sanctions and is not making any abrupt changes in policy			2
" we 've made it clear that it would be difficult for us to pursue our engagement unless that relationship was once and for all ended			0
" the message " had a receptive audience , " @entity17 said			2
that receptiveness may partly be the result of intense diplomatic contact between the two countries preceding @entity17 's visit			1
" we 've had about 20 or more high - level visits from our assistant secretary , our special representative and others			0
they have fanned out across the country , meeting with all kinds of people , " @entity17 said			1
@entity4 , the country 's leading activist for democratic reform , was instrumental in helping to gauge the @entity3 diplomatic approach , @entity17 said			1
" she is someone who we talk to and rely on about policy advice , and certainly we were very gratified that she encouraged us to engage , encouraged my trip			0
" @entity4 , who plans to run for parliament , expressed her hopes for more solid democratic reforms thanks to @entity3 efforts			2
" because of this engagement , i think our way ahead will be clearer and we will be able to trust that the process of democratization will go forward , " she told journalists			0
the junta has ruled @entity5 since 1962			2
@entity113 became president in march after a controversial election , and the new government freed dozens of political prisoners in october			0
the new government has shown encouraging signs of reform and has released some political prisoners , but @entity4 said that all such prisoners must be released and that no one should be arrested for their beliefs			0
" all hostilities must cease in this country , " she said			0
the road to democracy in @entity5 is closer than before , but there is still a ways to go , she added			1
" we are not on that road yet , but we hope to get there as soon as possible with the help and understanding of our friends , " she said			0
@entity17 became the first @entity3 secretary of state to visit the country in 50 years , and her visit was made possible by the nation 's unexpected steps toward democratic reform			1
the trip , the @entity142 said , indicates that the time could be right for the two nations to forge a new relationship			0
still , @entity5 is far from a democracy , and skepticism exists on both sides			2
journalists in the country enjoy new freedoms , but their work remains heavily regulated			0
ethnic violence still occurs against @entity5 's minorities , and human rights groups estimate that more than 1,500 political prisoners are still detained			0
for its part , @entity5 offered a cordial welcome to @entity17 , but the visit with officials was low - key			1
" we are at the very beginning , " @entity17 told @entity0			0
" where we will be in one year , five years or 10 , i ca n't really predict			0
" the secretary of state ended her visit to @entity5 on friday and is on her way back to the @entity3 .			1

new : @entity5 must end @entity46 military ties to get @entity3 cooperation , she says
