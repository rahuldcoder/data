-- as a kid growing up in the mid- 1960s , @entity1 would spend hours setting up miniature speedways on the living room carpet so that he could race his favorite slot cars up and down the electric tracks			2
" i thought that if they made real roads electric , then us kids could drive , " recalls @entity1 , who grew to become an electrical engineer			1
" that thought stuck with me my entire life			0
" fast forward to mid- 2000s , with the debate over global warming in full swing , @entity1 's wife @entity13 asked him whether he could build the electric roads he 'd concocted as a child out of solar panels			1
@entity1 initially laughed off the idea -- but not for long			2
with an airplane 's black box in mind , the couple started mulling over the possibility of creating a solar powered super-strong case that could house sensitive electronics			1
they explored the idea of embedding solar cells to store energy inside the case , @entity32 to illuminate the road lines and heating elements to resist ice and snow -- soon after , the concept of @entity38 was born			1
the couple 's proposal calls for the traditional petroleum - based asphalt highways to be replaced with a system of structurally - engineered solar panels			1
these would act as a massive energy generator that could feed the grid during daytime			0
they would also recharge electric vehicles while moving , thus helping to reduce greenhouse emissions drastically			0
" our original intent was to help solve the climate crisis , " says @entity1			0
" we learned that the @entity54 had over 72,000 square kilometers of asphalt and concrete surfaces exposed to the sun. if we could cover them with our solar road panels , then we could produce over three times the amount of energy that we use as a nation -- that 's using clean , renewable energy instead of coal			1
" the @entity67 - based couple received their first government contract to work on the project in 2009 , and have been working to perfect it ever since			2
initially , they joined forces with researchers to develop a super-strong textured glass that would offer cars the traction they require			1
then , they fitted @entity32 road markers to avoid destroying the cells by painting highway lines over them and heating to warm the surface and keep the system working			1
now , the pair is hoping to raise enough funds on crowdfunding site @entity88 to gear up production following the successful test of its latest prototype : a @entity38 parking lot laid next to their electronics lab. " they [ solar panels ] prevented snow and ice accumulation this past winter and are producing the expected amount of power -- the parking lot is equivalent to a @entity105 solar array , " says @entity1 , who 's hoping to be ready for production later this year or early 2014			1
" the panels have passed load testing for vehicles weighing up to 125 tons without breakage , " he adds			2
" our textured surface has been traction tested and can stop a vehicle traveling 128kph on a wet surface in the required amount of distance			2
" @entity1 says solar road panels could theoretically be laid anywhere -- from motorways and parking lots to pavements and playgrounds			1
he believes that such a prospect could transform the existing motorway infrastructure , prevent accidents and ultimately help save the planet from an environmental disaster			0
" in the @entity54 , roughly half of greenhouse gases are generated by burning fossil fuels to create electricity , " he says			0
" another 25 % comes out of our tailpipes , " adds @entity1			0
" by replacing coal with solar and making electric vehicles practical -- which could lead to the end of internal combustion engines -- we could theoretically cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75 %			0
@entity1 admits that " in the beginning about half of the people thought we were geniuses and the other half thought we were nuts , " before quickly adding that now " the vast majority of reactions are positive and supportive			0
" " i think that many people expect their governments to solve the world 's problems , but the climate crisis is getting worse and our politicians seem baffled , " he says			0
" many of our greatest technologies were created in someone 's garage			0
that 's where @entity38 was born and we think that we finally have a solution to the causes of global warming			2

the @entity38 founders are raising funds to gear up production
the aim is to replace asphalt roads with solar panels that can support cars
their idea calls for a solar powered roadway made of durable textured glass
the system also involves built - in led lights and heating elements
