-- in the early morning hours of @entity2 2009 , a gunshot rang out that resonated around the country			1
at 22 , @entity7 resident @entity5 was fatally shot by a transit police officer at the @entity10 train station in @entity11 , @entity12 , after being detained with other passengers on the platform following reports of a fight			1
@entity17 was unarmed , and the incident sparked waves of protests in the months that followed			1
the incident is chronicled in " @entity10 , " an independent film , scheduled for release on july 12 , that tells the story of the last day of @entity17 's life			1
for the film 's first - time director , @entity27 , the motivation to tell " @entity10 " was deeply personal			1
" if @entity35 were alive today , he 'd be the same age as me right now , he 'd be 27 , " @entity27 , who grew up in the @entity7 , told @entity0 at the movie 's @entity32 premiere			1
" when it happened , it really affected me			1
that 's also something that i deal with on a day - to - day basis , losing friends to gun violence			1
i 've seen lives cut short too soon			2
" he adds , " what gets glossed over is that we 're human beings too , like everybody else , young @entity49 - @entity48 males			2
our humanity can often be found in our relationships with the people who are closest to us , and those relations are n't often shown in headlines and whatever types of media you see us portrayed in			2
i hope the people can see a little bit of themselves in the character if they sit down and watch the film , and have a little bit of insight			2
" @entity63 upholds conviction in @entity12 subway shooting the issue of young lives being cut off violently and unnecessarily early is what drew notable cast members @entity70 and @entity71 to the film			2
@entity70 can easily recall the 2009 @entity73 station shooting , and he told @entity0 he feels a sense of responsibility to revive @entity17 's legacy			1
" the opportunity for me to play @entity5 , i mean i just had to jump at it			1
i felt a serious responsibility to play that role , " @entity70 said			2
" especially for the family , knowing one day his daughter 's going to watch this movie , and his mom , and the rest of his family and friends			0
i just want to do him justice			0
" to @entity91 , the story of @entity17 's death is representative of an ongoing societal problem			1
" sadly , ( this is ) very topical ... we 're losing way too many young men of color to this type of violence , " she told @entity0 , comparing the case to the more recent @entity96 shooting in february 2012			0
" and then of course there 's urban violence ; so we have to start somewhere with the conversation			0
" to the oscar - winner , the root of the problem lies in a lack of understanding between people of different races and backgrounds			2
the solution to curbing the violence , she believes , is in increased awareness and understanding			0
" it actually starts with the individual			0
what is your response when you see someone different ? " she said			0
" your inner dialogue has to change , my inner dialogue has to change			0
" @entity7 transit officers cleared in civil rights trial @entity91 reportedly donated and raised money for " @entity10 " when the film hit a funding plateau			1
the movie debuted at the @entity135 , where it won the @entity137 and the @entity138 for @entity48 dramatic film			0
it went on to win the award for @entity142 at the @entity143			0
" i think when people see this film , they will see that all of these young men are ... they 're human lives being lost , " @entity91 said			0
" once we can see people as human beings , i think maybe these incidents will be less likely to occur			0
" @entity152 : fast facts			0
