@entity0 -- @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , their 1980s - style hair shoved under their caps , look forever young in a substantial baseball card collection that 's missing an owner			1
since june 24 , the @entity11 has been trying to find the rightful owner of well more than 500 cards , each carefully placed in a plastic protective sleeve			1
a visitor to @entity17 found the cache of cards in a grassy area and notified police , who combed through crime reports but have thus far struck out on identifying the owner			1
" we do n't know if it fell off the back of a car , " lt. @entity25 said wednesday , indicating it 's his guess that they were stolen			2
police publicized the find wednesday and included photos of some of the collection			1
they are n't releasing all the information because they want to be sure whoever comes forward can provide extensive details before they turn them over			1
the @entity43 and @entity44 cards are of @entity46 players from the 1980s and 1990s			1
players include @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
@entity25 wo n't hazard a guess on their value , but he indicated some might be worth about $ 1			0
of course , a few could be worth more			0
if no one successfully claims them , the cards may be auctioned and serious collectors would get a better handle on their worth			2
" so much depends on condition , " @entity25 told @entity1			0
the department spokesman said he 's not an avid baseball fan			2
after all , he grew up in @entity0 , which twice lost the @entity62 to other cities and whose @entity64 have been dependable cellar - dwellers			1
he is friends with @entity69 fans and has at least one connection with one of the finds			0
" that @entity75 card is pretty cool , " @entity25 said , referring to the outfielder who starred for the @entity69 in the ' 70s			0
