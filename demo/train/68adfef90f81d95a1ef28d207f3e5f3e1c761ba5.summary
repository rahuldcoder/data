-- actress @entity1 is an ambassador for @entity2 , an organization that gives children the essentials for a safe and healthy childhood			1
approximately 21,000 children die every day from preventable causes , according to @entity2 , and its mission is to reduce that number to zero			1
@entity1 recently sat down with @entity0 's @entity10 to talk about @entity2 's efforts to save lives around the world and what a hero means to her			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity10 : why did you decide to get involved with @entity2 ? @entity1 : i 'd heard about @entity2 for a really long time			1
... they are on the ground all the time for these children			2
it 's so comforting to know that they have the ability to provide			2
when i go on these missions and i am there with the children in these villages , it is so heartbreaking			1
but it 's so inspiring to know that people have dedicated their lives to being there for these kids			1
i just feel like there 's so much more that needs to be done and that can be done , and i want to be part of that			2
@entity10 : what 's it been like working with children around the world ? liu : i think the one thing that i 've taken away from all of the travels and all of the countries that i 've been is that the children are always so warm and so inviting			1
even though some of their parents may have passed away , there 's always a wonderful sense of community that these kids have with one another and within the village that they live			1
it is about taking care of others and looking out for others			0
there 's a sense of family , togetherness			2
these kids stick together through thick and thin , and that 's something i think that 's really exciting			1
@entity10 : education is important to you			0
what does @entity2 do to promote education ? liu : i think it 's really heartbreaking to see children who want to have an education , who are hungry for that , but they 're not able to receive that			1
and i think @entity2 has the ability to put together -- in very difficult situations -- a sense of normalcy			1
in @entity86 , when i went there after the earthquake , they set up these school - in - a - box tents			0
it 's very simple , and you give children a feeling that there 's regularity in their lives even though everything else is falling apart for them			2
it 's easy for people to contribute also by saying , " i can contribute $ 10 to buy salts to make the water clean , " " i can give $ 100 for school - in - a - box , " which contains all the things that you need for school			0
it 's just incredible to see how much it means to them and how much we can give them			0
@entity10 : what is a hero to you ? liu : a hero to me is somebody who puts themselves last , who puts everything on the line for other people			0
i think that children can be heroes also			0
i have met young women and young men who have been abused , some young women who have been raped and who have been near death and have seen so much violence in their lives , but they do n't give up			2
they go and work in the shelter and tell their stories and help other women who have the same problem			0
young girls who have had unimaginable things happen to them			0
... they still stand up , and they still walk with their head high			0
these people could have given up a long time ago , and they never did .			0
