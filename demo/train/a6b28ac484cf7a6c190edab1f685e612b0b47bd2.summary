-- this may be a week of skeptical glances			1
when i took the subway home on monday night , after watching news that three people died and more than 100 were injured in a terror attack in @entity9 , i looked around at crowds and fellow passengers in @entity12 with an unfair twinge of suspicion			1
it 's difficult not to let events like this impact your patterns of thinking			1
it 's sometimes hard to do what @entity21 's @entity20 suggests : to keep calm and carry on			1
that used to be easy , before @entity24 , where i 'm from , and before 9/11			1
then it was more difficult			1
and just when it seemed like " terror " was a word that we could use with a sense of distance and irony -- and a concept we watched play out in films like " @entity35 " and not in our communities -- our collective sense of security threatened to evaporate again , after two explosions hit the finish line of the @entity41			1
we are left searching for answers and perpetrators			2
families are mourning those who died and praying for those who lost limbs and were severely injured			2
i think it 's because of all this uncertainty and soul - searching that a quote from @entity54 's lullaby - voiced comforter , mr. @entity55			1
bounced all over my @entity57 feed on monday afternoon , getting retweeted in various forms by thousands			1
" i would see scary things in the news , my mother would say ' look for the helpers			1
you will always find people who are helping			2
' " leave it to a former kids ' tv host to give @entity54 its moral compass			2
@entity69 : @entity70 rush to support stranded visitors right now , as the authorities try to figure out who did this and why , what the rest of us can do is take a moment to focus on the humanity that followed the tragedy			1
doing so will remind us that @entity54 is bigger and stronger than these events -- that we do n't have to let fear change us as it has before			2
@entity84 , a native bostonian and director of social media for @entity87 , compiled a short but powerful list of the helpers in @entity9			1
among them were people who ran toward the site of the explosion -- rather than away from it -- to try to help the people who were injured			2
they were marathoners who " kept running , all the way to @entity98 , to give blood " after the blasts went off			2
they were , of course , the police officers and other first responders who were photographed in numerous courageous and selfless acts , including carrying this small person away from the scene			2
" many were fleeing , " wrote @entity108 from the @entity109 , " but many were running to the wounded			2
they ripped down the metal barriers separating the runners from spectators			2
unsure of whether there would be another explosion , these strangers risked their lives to help other strangers , performing @entity122 , comforting those in shock , and carrying the wounded to the nearby medical tent			0
" others protected each other during the explosion			0
dr. @entity129 treated victims at the site of the explosion , according to @entity0 's live blog			0
" i saw at least six to seven people down next to me , " he said			0
" they protected me from the blast			0
one gentleman lost both his ( lower ) limbs			0
" they were runners who offered jackets to each other			0
and they included a photographer who walked through pools of blood to try to capture the horror and humanity of the scene , all while holding back tears of his own			0
outside that northeastern city , they were technologists who scrambled to publish tools to help relatives find their loved ones and to help stranded visitors find a safe place to stay the night			0
they were joggers who hit the streets in their own neighborhoods even though the blast may have shaken them up			0
on monday night , @entity160 , @entity161 's district attorney , took the microphone at a news conference and put words to these sentiments			1
" it was a large and disturbing scene			0
like each of you i am praying for the victims and their loved ones			0
it is a terrible , terrible day for them , " he said			0
" seconds after those bombs went off we saw civilians running to help the victims right alongside members of the @entity179 and @entity180			0
and in the hours that followed police and medical personnel from across the region have sent dozens , maybe even hundreds , of volunteers to help us here in @entity9			1
" that 's what @entity54 do in times of crisis			0
we come together and we help one another			0
moments like these , terrible as they are , do n't show our weakness , they show our strength			0
" that was true in @entity198 and @entity199			0
it was true in @entity201 , where people responded to a 2011 massacre by gathering around an @entity205 courthouse to sing			0
and it 's certainly true of @entity9			1
" moments like this , and our response to them , " @entity160 said in another press conference on tuesday morning , " define who we are			1
" it 's understandable to be shocked by these events and to be a little wary in the hours after tragedy			1
but as the " helpers " in the wake of the @entity9 bombing reminded me , we are more the same than different , and more good than evil			1
we 're all geared to be helpers			1
and that 's who we 'll continue to be .			0

a mr. @entity55 quote was *widely* shared on @entity57 on monday
after tragedy , he says , we should " look for the helpers "
@entity230 : that *message* is *resonant* following the @entity9 bombing
he says all of us are geared to help , and the bombing response shows that
