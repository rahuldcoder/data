-- i was blissed out on vacation when @entity3 gave me a one - two punch to the gut			1
a lovely breeze blew and jasmine hung in the air at the outdoor café as i flipped open my laptop			2
among the first things i noticed : a friend had commented on my ex-fiancé 's photos -- an ex i am not @entity3 friends with , think about only occasionally and have n't spoken to in more than four years			1
i had nowhere to be and was curious			0
so with my latte in one hand , i clicked with the other			0
boy , do i wish i had n't			0
in front of me were wedding pictures			0
and no matter how long it 's been and how wrong i know he and i were for each other , nausea washed over me -- and then came the short outburst of tears			1
you see , it 's one thing to hear that your ex-fiancé got married ; it 's another to find out by being slapped with the image of him kissing his beautiful bride			1
in that moment , before i was able to be genuinely happy for him , i was a 43 - year - old woman who hated @entity3			1
but thanks to my friends who learned about my experience by way of @entity3 ( yes , i see the irony ) , i quickly realized i was n't alone			1
plenty of others have had those moments when , simply put , @entity3 sucks			1
of course , there are the exes , including those who said they did n't want kids but are now cradling newborns			0
but also consider those grappling with infertility who then get blindsided by ultrasound photos and baby announcements			0
or the newly divorced mother of three who 's working to build a new normal but gets knocked down each time she sees vacation albums of happy , seemingly perfect and intact families			2
oh , and do n't forget the guy with the crumbling career who must see how another man 's soars			2
i ca n't help but think about the 20 - something kids running around @entity3 headquarters , too young to know the hurt of not being able to bear children or failed decades - long marriages			1
what do they know about these sorts of life challenges ? a friend from graduate school , who like me was n't friends with his ex , had it worse			1
his ex got married twice , on two different continents , and then -- just when he thought he was in the clear -- she had to have an additional reception			2
" i could n't get away , " he said			0
" it dragged on and on			0
" and in today 's @entity3 world , he added , it 's not enough to move from pain to acceptance			1
we also feel pressure to " like " what we see			0
@entity3 inspires status envy " if i were talking with a friend and i said , ' it 's fine			1
i 'm happy for her , ' and he pulled out a picture of her on the beach in her wedding dress and said , ' oh yeah ? look at this			0
now how do you feel ? ' i 'd probably have to punch him , " he wrote			2
of course , @entity3 offers privacy setting options and ways to block people , which can be a salve -- if , unlike me , you 're able to keep up with how they all work			1
but like it or not , in a world where being part of @entity3 seems inescapable , there 's a new reality			1
it 's one in which tiny personal daggers may be thrown at you when you least expect them			2
a social media expert , who refused to be named but works to put all of us out there ( yes , i see the irony ) , had this to say in response to my concerns			0
" for every ex girlfriend bummed by an old boyfriend pic there are families reunited , kidney donations offered , old friends reconnected , family reunions planned , " he wrote in an e-mail			2
" just because there is @entity3 does n't mean this is a new problem -- women with fertility problems ca n't avoid seeing pregnant women on the street or seeing babies in strollers either , and newly divorced people or newly broken up with people ca n't avoid seeing happy couples on the sidewalk			1
" tired of baby pics on @entity3 ? try this ! fantastic points , to be sure			1
i get and have benefited from all that is good and powerful about @entity3			1
i 'm not even blaming the company			0
i 'm just formally acknowledging that sometimes it can , well , suck			0
it can screw you up in the head and heart in a way strangers on the street do n't			0
the happy couple kissing on the virtual sidewalk of @entity3 might include the ex. the bride , all smiles , who strolls by on @entity3 linked to another man 's arm could be the one who tore out your heart and stomped on it			1
and those new moms pushing strollers on @entity3 , the ones who had perfect ultrasound photos and were able to carry babies to term , they might be the high school girls who made you feel insecure , the college roommates you once competed with , the cousins who seem to have it all when you 're still struggling			1
" @entity3 is a happy place , for happy people , posting happy things , " said one friend , who 's had a doozy of a year			1
" so when you 're in a difficult life situation , it can become a terribly painful place to visit			0
" so very true , but the thing is this : when i got slapped with my ex-fiancé 's wedding photos , i was in a happy place -- nowhere near a difficult life situation			2
i had no reason to avoid the visit			0
it was a @entity3 moment that put me in a painful place			2
like ripping off a @entity198 , i both heard the news of his marriage and saw the proof in seconds			0
and it , frankly , sucked			0
the good news is , i got over it quickly			2
half an hour later , i was soaking up the sunshine and could honestly say i was happy for him			0
but i know i was lucky			0
there are plenty of others for whom those beatings from @entity3 last longer			2
for that very reason , i can not possibly " like " this part of our new reality			0
