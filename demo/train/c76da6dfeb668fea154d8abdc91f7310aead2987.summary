-- death , taxes and @entity3			1
some things in life are just certain			0
for the bookmakers , it was not a question of if @entity3 could win saturday 's @entity11 stakes at @entity12 , it was by how much			1
so popular was the mighty mare with punters , a one dollar investment might have earned you 20 cents , providing the bookie was feeling generous			1
the @entity19 - trained sprinter came to @entity20 with 21 wins from 21 starts			0
race number 22 was @entity3 's first outside @entity25 , and thousands traveled with her , invading the typically - @entity28 race course			1
royal regulations for @entity12 's fashionistas @entity3 's colors of black and salmon pink were worn with pride in frocks , fascinators and ties			1
@entity37 and gold are @entity25 's sporting colors of choice but this was the exception , reserved only for an exceptional performer			1
@entity25 journalist @entity43 traveled from @entity44 , @entity45 , to watch @entity3 sprint to racing royalty			1
@entity43 , who moonlights as a race - caller and is a thoroughbred owner himself , has followed this story from the time she was a filly and knew exactly what to expect , even if the @entity28 did not			0
" i 've been overhearing people in @entity56 streets , in bars , saying how ' the @entity25 think they 've got this amazing horse ' and so i told them , ' we do n't think we 've got an amazing horse , we know we 've got an amazing horse ' , " said @entity43			1
on the back of fantastic form , few surprises were expected but no one anticipated a photo finish			0
it silenced an otherwise raucous record crowd and , for the moment , history was on hold			0
" it was a disappointing finish for @entity3 , " @entity43 said after the result was decided by a photo			2
" she should have won by much more			2
" it has been revealed a back injury could have slowed the champion mare , but as debate rages over how @entity3 won , the fact that she did was reward enough for the thousands of ex-pats who had been hearing nothing but great things			1

@entity3 has won all 22 of the races she has taken part in
the @entity25 " *supermare* " won the @entity11 stakes at @entity12
