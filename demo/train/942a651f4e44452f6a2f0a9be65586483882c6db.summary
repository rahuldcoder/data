@entity0 -- the past few days in @entity2 have been marked by an escalation of street protests and ongoing clashes with riot police in the center of @entity8 , as @entity2 respond to new repressive laws adopted last week			1
the legislation seriously undermines the freedom of assembly , media , privacy and civil society			2
these laws constitute a crackdown on major democratic freedoms and offer a path to dictatorship			1
they criminalize defamation , introduce a label of " foreign agents " for foreign funded ngos , enact jail terms for wearing masks and hard hats during the protest , and restrict the work of non-registered news agencies			2
in short they could seriously undermine the chances for free and fair presidential elections when they are held			1
the protests erupted two months ago against @entity37 president @entity36 's foreign policy u-turn away from @entity39 integration			1
since then , his strategy has been to suppress and intimidate the media and political activists			2
in december , prominent journalist @entity43 was attacked and badly beaten			2
the @entity2 president 's office condemned the attack and ordered an investigation			1
since then , four protesters have died amid ongoing clashes with police and dozens have been arrested -- and a @entity54 spokesman told the @entity55 that the church 's website had been compromised by cyber attacks via neighboring @entity59			1
instead of dialogue and compromise , president @entity36 has chosen the hard line towards establishing dictatorial rule			1
his ruling @entity65 , in cooperation with the @entity67 , passed the repressive laws , and the @entity69 issued a decree allowing riot police to use force and weapons against the protesters			1
the @entity8 court prohibited any demonstrations until march 8			2
statements about the " foreign instigated " nature of the protests and the language of an " external enemy " have started to appear in the ruling party rhetoric			1
@entity36 has also fired his long - standing head of presidential administration , @entity86 , who is believed to take a moderate position in proposing dialogue with the opposition and protesters			1
as of today his post is vacant			0
the expectations are that it could be filled by a hardliner			0
groups of thugs and aggressive young men who support the government have further destabilized the situation			0
on tuesday more than 500 of them were roaming the streets of @entity8			0
any attempts by citizens to call in police forces to address this security issues were ignored			2
such further escalations could be the plan of the elites to introduce marshal law and forbid any demonstrations			0
what can be seen in @entity2 is an attempt to create a criminal dictatorial rule in order to preserve the power of @entity36 , as the chances of his political survival or a victory in free and fair elections in 2015 are slipping away			1
it is a dangerous strategy , which will be futile for three main reasons			0
first , the civic protest is strong and is spreading to the east and south of @entity2			1
each aggressive move on the side of the regime sparks more and more people on the streets			0
independent opinion polls show that 50 % of the population support the protest and 25 % cent are ready to participate in it actively			0
second , the charisma of @entity36 is hardly matching the profile of the dictator			1
his recent addresses to the nation and pre-recorded closed meetings with @entity2 media show his lack of confidence and evasion of talking about political crisis			1
much less is he ready to face any open rally of his supporters			0
his popularity levels are at a record low			0
even before the start of the protest they were only 14 % , compared to 42 % in 2010			0
finally , @entity2 's economic model is not viable to support a dictatorship			1
the macroeconomic situation remains very fragile and the investment climate had deteriorated even before the political crisis			0
the coffers of the state are drained as illegal raids pushed businesses into a shadow economy			0
the $ 15 billion infusion from @entity59 will only help so much and these disbursements will be tied to conditionality , such as state asset sales			0
earlier this month the @entity168 pointed to endemic corruption , weak governance , limited access to finance and a lack of competition as serious obstacles to growth			0
all this dooms @entity36 's aspirations for a dictatorial rule			1
he should face the reality of irreversible change and prevent a further escalation			0
the alternative is an unpredictable collapse of his rule , as the nation will reject a tight grip on freedom and democracy			2
read : clashes turn deadly for first time the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2
