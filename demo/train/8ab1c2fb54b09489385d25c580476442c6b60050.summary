-- reading the official website of the @entity2 and you would be forgiven for thinking the reclusive @entity5 state was the @entity6 of @entity7			1
no taxes , zero unemployment and a performance - related reward - for - labor bonus regime , @entity2 touts itself as having " a people - centered social system in which the masses of the working people are the masters of everything and everything in society serves them			2
" this sunday , @entity2 will be required to show their assent for this political system at general elections universally expected to return the current incumbent @entity22			1
" constituencies and sub-constituencies are crowded with citizens confirming their names on voter rolls , " the state - run news agency @entity23 said in a report			0
" now the @entity2 people are fully determined to highly exalt the @entity2 's dignity and demonstrate once again the might of single - minded unity by casting ballots for their candidates			1
" political show while critics say the poll is merely a political show to legitimize the country 's rubber stamp parliament -- previous elections in 2009 returned @entity44 ( @entity22 's predecessor and father ) with a 100 % mandate on a 99.98 % turnout -- observers will be poring over the list of legislators for clues as to how @entity22 will govern the @entity53 nation over the next five years			1
@entity22 himself is running for a seat in the @entity56 ; significant because the numbers are regarded as auspicious in @entity2 culture and because @entity2 claims @entity59 , located in @entity60 on the border with @entity62 , to be the legendary birthplace of his father			2
the ruling @entity65 holds all 687 seats within the @entity67 and voters have only one candidate to vote for in each of the seats			1
while the umbrella grouping officially contains four parties -- the @entity77 , the @entity72 , the @entity73 and the @entity74 in @entity75 -- all candidates must be sanctioned by the party including three independents currently sitting as deputies in the assembly			2
@entity83 census while it is possible for a voter to cast a ballot against a candidate , they must walk to a special booth to do so			0
critics say few are brave enough to cross out the name on the ballot			0
according to one defector , @entity94 , the elections serve as a de facto census at a time when many @entity2 have slipped over the border to @entity62			2
" the government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list , they will investigate it , " @entity94 told the @entity99 newspaper			0
" it is often during elections that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed			0
" @entity111 , a @entity2 expert from @entity112 in @entity113 , said the sole purpose of elections in @entity2 was to legitimize the regime			1
" it 's a bad analogy , and maybe you should n't compare any acting leader to @entity120 , but @entity120 also had elections , " @entity111 told @entity0			0
" @entity122 is a republic and you are supposed to have elections			0
" @entity126 had elections , @entity125 had elections , why not @entity22 ? it 's a way to legitimize ( itself ) , to show that 99 % of all registered voters came to vote and all of them -- 100 % -- voted for the regime , therefore we are the world 's most popular government			1
" do 100 % of @entity136 vote for their current @entity136 president ? never , so to @entity2 the @entity136 government is far less popular , far less democratic			1
" who 's in , out ? he said that while the @entity67 was little more than a sham election , it was still be of interest to @entity143 watchers keen to know the composition of the ruling party			1
" it will give us some new names and the absence of some names will be equally important , " he said			0
" we will see who is losing power and who is gaining power because according to their unspoken tradition , the top 200 people or so are always by default members of the @entity67			0
" analysts will also be keenly watching for signs that supporters of @entity161 , @entity22 's once - powerful uncle who was executed in december for treason , have been eliminated or sidelined in the elections .			0

@entity2 head to polls on march 9 to vote for deputies in the @entity67
critics say the poll is merely a political show to legitimize the country 's rubber stamp parliament
in previous elections in 2009 , @entity44 was returned with 100 % of the vote
vote is of interest to @entity143 watchers keen to know the composition of the ruling party
