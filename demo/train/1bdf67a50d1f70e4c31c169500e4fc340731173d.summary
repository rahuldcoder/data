-- the @entity2 @entity1 said friday it has joined the whistle - blower lawsuit against cyclist @entity4 that was originally filed by a former teammate			1
the @entity1 will file its formal complaint in 60 days			1
@entity4 , the onetime legendary and now disgraced cyclist , has admitted to using performance - enhancing drugs			2
he was the team 's lead rider when the @entity10 sponsored the team from 1996 to 2004 and @entity4 won six of his seven @entity14 titles , the @entity1 said			1
the civil lawsuit alleges that @entity4 and former team managers submitted false claims for government funds to the sponsoring @entity10 by their " regularly employing banned substances and method to enhance their performance " in violation of the sponsorship agreement , the federal announcement said			1
" today 's action demonstrates the @entity1 's steadfast commitment to safeguarding federal funds and making sure that contractors live up to their promises , " @entity25 , principal deputy assistant attorney general for the civil division , said in a statement			1
read the lawsuit between 2001 and 2004 , the @entity10 paid $ 31 million in sponsorship fees , but that affiliation has now been " unfairly associated with what has been described as ' the most sophisticated , professionalized , and successful doping program that sport has ever seen , ' " said @entity39 , @entity2 attorney for the @entity40			2
" in today 's economic climate , the @entity10 is simply not in a position to allow @entity4 or any of the other defendants to walk away with the tens of millions of dollars they illegitimately procured , " @entity39 said			1
the suit that the @entity1 is joining is by former @entity4 teammate @entity46 and was unsealed by @entity48 @entity47			1
it provides details of the payments @entity4 and his team received while they promised to abide by the rules of cycling 's governing bodies			2
those rules prohibited the use of certain performance enhancing substances and methods			0
" this lawsuit is designed to help the @entity10 recoup the tens of millions of dollars it paid out ( to ) the @entity62 cycling team based on years of broken promises , " @entity39 said			1
the suit also names as defendants @entity66 , who had managed the @entity10 and @entity69 racing teams on which @entity4 raced , and @entity70 , which was the team 's management entity , the @entity1 said			1
the @entity1 is joining the lawsuit 's allegations against @entity66 and @entity62 , but it is n't intervening in the suit 's claims against several other defendants , the agency said			1
the @entity10 supported the @entity1 intervention			1
this so - called qui tam case allows the resources of the federal government to intervene on the side of a whistle - blower			0
if the suit is successful the government stands to recoup millions , and @entity46 stands to claim a sizable share of the proceeds -- possibly in the millions of dollars			2
the government had been working on the case for several weeks in advance of a likely federal intervention			0
" the defendants agreed to play by the rules and not use performance enhancing drugs , " general counsel and executive vice president @entity93 said in a statement			0
" we now know that the defendants failed to live up to their agreement , and instead knowingly engaged in a pattern of activity that violated the rules of professional cycling and , therefore , violated the terms of their contracts with the @entity10			1
" the lawsuit accuses the former management of @entity4 's team of defrauding the federal government of millions of dollars because it knew about the drug use and did n't do anything			1
the federal government had been evaluating for weeks whether to intervene in the lawsuit			0
an attorney for @entity4 , @entity117 , said that ongoing discussions between the federal government and @entity4 's legal team had collapsed			2
" @entity4 and his representatives worked constructively over these last weeks with federal lawyers to resolve this case fairly , but those talks failed because we disagree about whether the @entity10 was damaged , " @entity117 said			1
" @entity127 's own studies show that the service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship -- benefits totaling more than $ 100 million			0
" @entity4 's attorneys declined to comment further on friday 's @entity1 announcement			2
former teammate @entity46 , who was stripped of his 2006 @entity14 title after failing a drug test , filed the lawsuit in 2010 against the team , which was sponsored the @entity10			2
@entity46 was a teammate of @entity4 on the @entity10 - sponsored team from 2002 to 2004 , and his lawsuit was filed under the @entity139 , the @entity1 said			1
that act is commonly called the whistle - blower law			0
the law permits the federal government to investigate allegations and intervene , the @entity1 said			0
the act was originally passed in 1863 when government officials were concerned that suppliers to the @entity148 during the @entity149 could be defrauding them			0
in 1986 , @entity150 modified the law to make it easier for whistle - blowers to bring cases and give them a larger share of any penalties collected			0
whistle - blowers can now take home between 15 % and 30 % of the sums collected in their cases			0
for years , @entity4 had denied drug use and blood doping , but he publicly admitted such use in january , three months after international cycling 's governing body stripped him of his seven @entity14 titles			0
that stripping came after a damning report by the @entity170 accused @entity4 and his team of the " most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program " in cycling history			0
that agency praised the @entity1 's announcement			0
" the @entity69 was run as a fraudulent enterprise and individuals both inside and outside of sport aided and abetted this scheme and profited greatly , " ceo @entity176 said in a statement			0
@entity0 's @entity182 in @entity40 and @entity183 in @entity184 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 will file formal complaint in 60 days
feds wo n't allow @entity4 and managers " to walk away " with tens of millions of dollars
" the defendants failed to live up to their agreement , " postal official says
" we disagree *...* whether the @entity10 was damaged , " @entity4 attorney says
