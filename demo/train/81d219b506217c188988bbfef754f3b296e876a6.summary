no one was hit , said a spokeswoman for maj. gen. @entity10 , head of the @entity11 in @entity5			1
the incident came as @entity1 , international envoy @entity13 and others implored the @entity15 to stop the violence in @entity5 , which started 15 months ago when a tough @entity5 crackdown against peaceful protesters developed into an uprising			1
the latest massacre occurred on wednesday in the village of @entity22 , west of @entity23 , and included reports that dozens of civilians , including women and children , were killed			1
massacre details are eerily familiar @entity1 said the @entity2 monitors had been denied access to the area but were working to get to the scene			1
" i just learned a few minutes ago that while trying to do so , the @entity2 monitors were shot at by small arms , " he said			1
@entity10 said observers heading to the village to verify reports of the killings had been blocked by soldiers and civilians			1
residents told observers they would be at risk if they were to enter the village			1
" despite these challenges , the observers are still working to get into the village to try to establish the facts on the ground , " @entity10 said			1
" @entity46 is concerned about the restriction imposed on its movement as it will impede our ability to monitor , observe and report			0

" all @entity5 will lose			1
" the violence is worsening and the country is becoming more polarized and radicalized , he said			0
" despite the acceptance of the six - point plan and the deployment of a courageous mission of @entity2 observers to @entity5 , i must be frank and confirm that the plan is not being implemented , " he added			1
@entity13 said @entity52 ministers he addressed saturday had " offered concrete ideas on how to increase pressure for compliance			0
" " clearly , the time has come to determine what more can be done to secure implementation of the plan and / or what other options exist to address the crisis , " he said			2
he spoke in the wake of the killings in @entity22 and , two weeks ago , in @entity86			2
more than 100 people , including women and children , were killed in @entity86			1
opposition activists blamed government forces and allied militia , an assertion denied by @entity5 president @entity94			2
" those responsible for perpetrating these crimes must be held to account , " @entity13 said			0
" we can not allow mass killing to become part of everyday reality in @entity5			2
" militia does regime 's ' dirty work , " analysts say he said he urged @entity94 nine days ago to " change his military posture and honor his commitments to the six - point plan			2
" but @entity94 " believed the main obstacle was the actions of militants , " @entity13 said			0
" clearly , all parties must cease violence			0
but equally clearly , the first responsibility lies with the government			0
" though @entity5 has released some detainees and there has been agreement " on modalities for humanitarian assistance , " more is required , @entity13 said			2
since he and @entity94 spoke , " shelling of cities has intensified " and " government - backed militia has free rein with appalling consequences			0
" @entity13 said armed opposition forces have n't seen a " reason to respect cessation of hostilities " and " have intensified their attacks			0
" referring to bombings in @entity134 and @entity135 , he said the situation is " made more complex " by attacks that are " indicative of the presence of a third actor			0
" some analysts say jihadist groups are responsible for those acts			0
@entity13 called for " consequences if compliance is not forthcoming , " and said " a clearer course for a peaceful transition " must be charted to resolve the crisis			2
@entity13 was to address the @entity148 in @entity149			0
@entity5 ambassador to the @entity2 @entity151 reiterated that anti-government terrorists , and not the regime , are responsible for the bloodshed			1
the government said terrorists timed the latest massacre to coincide with the @entity2 meetings in order to make the regime look bad			2
he added that @entity5 " is ready to receive an investigation committee from neutral countries that respect the @entity2 charter and reject any intervention in the @entity5 affairs , " according to the government 's @entity160			1
@entity151 said @entity5 is open to reform and to dialogue , and that it has no problem with the opposition			2
however , he said , some opposition forces composed of outside elements are taking up arms and have no desire for reconciliation			0
opposition activists accuse forces loyal to @entity94 of the killings at @entity22 , and they placed the number of dead at 78			2

more than half of those killed were women and children , said a local activist who reported having carried bodies			1
