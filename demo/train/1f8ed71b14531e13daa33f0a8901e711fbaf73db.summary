-- @entity1 believes his chances of ending @entity4 's grip on the world championship will be greatly improved when @entity7 's new rules come into force next season			1
some of the most significant changes will involve the engines , with cars having to switch from their current 2.4 - liter engines to a 1.6 - liter turbocharged v6 engine			0
there will also be adjustments to both aerodynamics and energy systems , and @entity1 is relishing the potential consequences			2
" i 'm really excited about next year , " the 2008 world champion told @entity21			1
" we have new rules , new engines and the cars are going to be a lot different			0
we 're hoping it will make the playing field more level and that it gives us the chance to race			0
" i just want to race and have a chance to fight for the championship			2
" in his first season with @entity35 , @entity32 lies fourth in the drivers ' standings , trailing recently - crowned champion @entity4 by 172 points with just two races of the season left			1
yet the @entity41 has the chance to help his team finish second in the constructors ' world championship , even if @entity35 still have plenty to do in both @entity47 and @entity48 with @entity49 and @entity50 hot on their heels			1
the 334 - point tally of @entity1 and teammate @entity53 is just 11 more than @entity49 , while @entity50 are also a threat with 297 points			2
wherever @entity35 do finish , @entity1 will consider it a major improvement on last year when the team finished fifth in the constructors ' standings , trailing fourth - placed @entity50 by a wide margin			1
" i really want to help this team finish second in the constructors ' championship , " explained a driver who left @entity65 to sign a three - year deal with @entity35 in september 2012			1
" we 've had some tough races this season but we are growing race by race			0
we have achieved something just incredible this year , to go from where the team was n't really so successful last year to becoming the ones that are competing with @entity49 and @entity79			0
" what motivates me is the chance to be world champion again in future -- and i know i have to put the work in now for what will hopefully be future success			1
" so will the @entity35 mechanics who face an anxious start to the season , as all the teams will , given the potential for early reliability problems because of the new rules			1
in addition to the introduction of a new powertrain , further changes include narrower front wings , a reduction in nose height and the prohibiting of exhaust blowing			0
nonetheless , a belief exists within @entity1 that an initial year of learning can help both team and driver next season , so giving him a platform to build on his solitary win -- in @entity111 -- in 2013			2
" there 's every chance that @entity79 will have just as competitive a car next year as this , but what i 'm really confident in is the guys who are building my car , " the 28 - year - old rallied			0
" they have done such a great job with this year 's car , and i just feel like we 've really built a foundation this year which we can use next year to put ourselves in a position to fight with them			0
" going into my second year , hopefully i 'll really have my thumbprint on the new car so it 'll be a little more comfortable for me to drive			0

@entity1 is relishing the new rules that will kick in with the 2014 season
