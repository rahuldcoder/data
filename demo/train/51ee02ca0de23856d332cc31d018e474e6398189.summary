-- growing up in @entity2 , there are a few things i never imagined myself doing , like driving a car , living in a house or attending big high school games like the ones i 'd seen on tv			1
yet in the years since leaving the isolated enclave of @entity10 , i 've taken pleasure in expanding my horizon and checking off all - american rites of passage , most recently , the baseball spring training road trip			1
by now , it 's a familiar tradition : as spring approaches , @entity19 teams head for camps in @entity22 and @entity23 to work off the winter flab and get ready for the regular season			1
it 's become a big tourist draw , with 2012 game attendee numbers in @entity22 expected to surpass 1.5 million as the spring training season winds down this week			1
a new era of enhanced training facilities and stadiums have all the 21st - century bells and whistles , but in some respects , spring training is still a throwback to a more casual , pastoral brand of baseball			1
my initiation was an abbreviated tour , three games in three stadiums , with a beach condo in @entity45 as home base			1
i 'm not a huge baseball fan , though i have found that appearing tolerant of sports generally makes you more likeable			1
but i consider myself a loyal girlfriend to a @entity53 fan who starts counting down on january 1 to the day pitchers and catchers report , who brought me to a @entity57 game early in our relationship			2
plus , we would be staying on the beach , so i welcomed the opportunity to familiarize myself with one of the nation 's most cherished pastimes			2
friends and colleagues had briefed me on themes to look out for , including the corporatization of spring training , " snowbirds " and interstate billboards warning against abortion on one side and promoting strip clubs on the other			1
i encountered nearly all of them , but what made the most profound impression was experiencing baseball stripped of its major corporate trappings : stadiums where puny chain - link fences separate fans from idols and beer is cheaper than in the majors ( though it 'll still set you back at least $ 5 ) ; no @entity91 - sponsored tool races or incessantly loud @entity93 ads. it 's a magic formula that has drawn fans to @entity22 for decades , though people only really began coming in droves in the last two decades , said @entity98 with @entity99 , a sports promotion and tourist development organization			1
the advent of live remote broadcasts , which showed stadiums lined with palm trees and players with rolled - up shirtsleeves , started pulling in visitors from snow - covered states , he said			2
when players ' salaries began to rise in the 1980s , teams turned to spring training to expand the franchise , i.e. , revenue			1
a similar pattern emerged in @entity23 , home to the 15 teams of the @entity119 , the @entity121 version of @entity22 's @entity122			1
with 2011 game attendance surpassing 1.5 million visitors in 14 @entity22 stadiums , devotees worry that spring training 's popularity is diluting its homegrown appeal			1
a hotel room near a stadium for less than $ 100 was hard to come by , and had we waited until game day to buy tickets we would 've been shut out of two of three games			1
" that 's the biggest difference right there , " said @entity98			0
" walking up and buying a ticket on game day ( used to be ) easy -- lucky if you can do that anymore			0
" the movement of teams from old stadiums into major complexes turned spring training into big business for the teams and the communities that host them , @entity98 said , bringing in roughly $ 753 million a year in @entity22			1
" you have the @entity53 in 1998 going from @entity152 to @entity153 , of all places , " he said			0
" you know if @entity153 's getting involved in it there 's some big business there			0
" it 's so @entity153 , " one man lamented as we walked out of a @entity53 game at @entity165 's @entity164			0
@entity167 , preseason home of the @entity53 , is located behind @entity153 's arch , and many consider the team 's presence near the @entity173 antithetical to the spirit of spring training			1
@entity176 runs some of the box offices flanking the @entity178 , where the selection of @entity53 gear pales in comparison to the array of apparel festooned with @entity153 characters			0
inside the flawless cream - colored stadium , " cast members " served food in baskets bearing @entity190 ears and the tagline " where dreams come true			0
" @entity193 escorted a local sports anchor onto the field to throw the first pitch			0
when the game gets boring , you can seek a reprieve in the @entity200 , equipped with 17 @entity202 consoles , at $ 5 for 30 minutes			0
near the field , however , the mood in the air was more akin to a county fair than a professional baseball game			1
in a section of designated lawn seating , clusters of families and friends stretched out on blankets and children ran amok among stumbling drunks while couples canoodled			0
plus , i can vouch for the pulled pork sandwich			0
it was heartwarming stuff , the " real @entity222 " that i 'd grown up seeing on tv and in movies , a place where baseball is a microcosm of the community , the underdogs win and the guy gets the girl			1
but , make no mistake , real @entity222 requires a car and a license , or a boyfriend with both			0
and patience , because traffic 's a bitch , especially in places like @entity240 , spring training home of the @entity242 and the @entity243 ( that 's a shark ! ) the rest of the year			1
located , ironically enough , on a former @entity91 site on @entity222 19 , the @entity242 ' @entity246 represents the partnerships among local government and the franchises that have nurtured spring training			1
it seems to be a win - win for folks in @entity240 and tourists from up @entity255 , where the @entity256 is promoted year - round as a vacation destination , and not just for spring training , @entity98 said			1
the day we saw the @entity53 play the @entity242 , i also learned that the beauty of preseason play is that it creates a home away from home for fans from afar			1
concession stands offered @entity265 , knishes and p - shaped pretzels			0
at the bar , strangers swapped profanity - laced travel tips			0
in " tiki bar " outfield seating , fans sat on bar stools behind long tables , raising bottles of @entity276 in the direction of players passing by			1
others of a more inebriated nature demanded that @entity281 sign a beer bucket or have his " ass kicked " and needled sports anchor @entity284 with taunting , prolonged cries of " @entity287 ! " fans rooted for the home team and made fun of the @entity53			2
in the grassy parking lot , a leathery old man hawked collectors ' cards a few feet from @entity295 selling cookies			0
a man and a child tossed a ball around while we naively sat in our car for an hour waiting to reach the interstate			0
we did n't have that problem leaving @entity153			0
many teams enjoy longstanding relationships with host cities , including the @entity242 , who 've trained in @entity240 for more than 60 years , confirming their place within the community			0
but smaller host cities like @entity311 enjoy a special air of nostalgia , thanks to an old stadium recently renovated to retain a look reminiscent of scenes from " @entity318 , " the only baseball movie i ever enjoyed			2
@entity321 , preseason home of the @entity323 for more than 40 years , is in downtown @entity311 in between a smaller baseball diamond , a @entity325 and the @entity326 of @entity327 , where parking is available for $ 7			2
that may seem like a lot , but to my boyfriend , who pays $ 10 to park at the @entity335 lot near @entity336 and then walk another 10 minutes , it was money well spent , especially for a short walk			0
outside the stadium , fans tailgated on the lawn of the public works building and a @entity344 truck offered free grilled - cheese sandwiches			2
inside the home of the @entity348 , vendors sold @entity349 next to county - fair - style stalls offering kettle corn , funnel cakes and turkey legs			0
in the stands before the game , sun - scorched retirees vacationing as ushers chastised fans for leaning over the dugout for autographs			2
but they did n't actually stop them from tossing balls and baseball caps to @entity366 's @entity365 , who patiently smiled and signed			2
what our plastic stadium bench seats lacked in shade was made for up in proximity to the @entity323 ' warmup area , separated from the fans by a low wall and a chain - link fence			2
fans of @entity366 filled the stands , their black shirts eclipsing the @entity323 ' @entity380 green			2
in front of us , a man complained to his neighbor of the difficulty of getting tickets for the @entity387 at @entity388 in @entity389			0
" @entity390 , " he muttered			0
meanwhile , his wife gave instructions to their granddaughters via cell phone on where to stand to get @entity365 's autograph			0
i was reminded of something my boyfriend said the day before , as we walked along the beach and listed all the license plates we 'd seen so far : @entity403 , @entity404 , @entity405 , @entity22 , @entity406 , @entity407 , @entity408 ( @entity409 is near @entity410 , home of the @entity411 since 1977 ) : " i like the idea that all these people are on vacation to see baseball , " he said			1
check that off the list !			0
