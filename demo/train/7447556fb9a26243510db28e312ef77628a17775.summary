-- with @entity3 's foreign minister @entity6 and @entity8 secretary of state @entity7 set to meet in @entity9 and the november 24 deadline to the @entity11 and @entity3 nuclear talks in sight , the @entity2 's ability to provide @entity3 with significant sanctions relief early in a nuclear deal remains unclear			1
at the same time , any perceived failure by the @entity8 to deliver could complicate , if not poison , what will already be a tenuous post-deal period			2
@entity8 negotiators have not helped their cause			0
during the latest round of talks in @entity24 , the @entity8 's lead negotiator , @entity21 , promised that " as soon as we [ the @entity8 ] suspend our major sanctions -- which will happen very early in the agreement -- the world will flood into @entity3			1
" her comment was echoed by that of @entity32 diplomats , who likewise urged the @entity3 " not [ to ] underestimate the huge economic relief for their people " in case of a nuclear deal			2
holding out the carrot to @entity3 is a sensible negotiating strategy , but only insofar as the @entity8 and its @entity41 partners can deliver on it			1
few , however , believe that to be the case			0
companies that would otherwise jump at the opportunity to capture @entity3 's enormous market are being advised to take a wait - and - see approach in the case of a nuclear deal			2
at the same time , @entity3 's population -- according to recent polling -- remains in a state of disbelief as to the @entity8 's willingness to lift the sanctions and turn the page in its relationship with @entity56			1
this should be a major source of concern			0
it 'd be the ultimate tragedy for the @entity2 , which has spent as much political capital as it has on the nuclear negotiations , to have defeat snatched from the jaws of victory thanks to the lingering effects of its sanctions			2
with a region in turmoil as @entity73 , which calls itself the " @entity74 , " continues its rampage through @entity76 and the @entity77 , the @entity70 administration can not afford the outbreak of hostilities with @entity3			1
that 's why president @entity70 must take steps to instill confidence in all parties that the @entity8 can uphold its end of any nuclear bargain			1
what can the @entity2 do ? first , control the process			0
what the @entity2 needs to do is take control of the sanctions file , create a plan of action for sanctions relief , and oversee the various federal agencies involved with sanctions enforcement			1
some of that has occurred during the interim period of negotiations -- as the @entity2 was not keen on any surprises that would frustrate the @entity3 and the nuclear talks in the process -- but @entity2 involvement needs to accelerate if sanctions relief is to take place in a clear and coordinated fashion			1
why is this so important ? because @entity41 , @entity106 , and even potentially @entity8 firms will be looking at the roll - out of sanctions relief to gauge the speed and confidence with which they ( re- ) enter @entity3			1
companies ' legal advisers will be paying close attention to whether there is uniformity in the way federal agencies interpret the relevant rules and regulations , including what are expected to be broadened licensing schemes for more expanded trade with and investment in @entity3			0
uniformity of this kind can only come about under the explicit direction of the @entity2			0
second , signal a shift			0
while a nuclear deal promises to bring to a close the most tense chapter in @entity8 - @entity3 relations , the post-deal landscape could see the two parties hedging their bets , as commitments are weighed and obligations deferred			1
outside observers will view all of this with skepticism , and caution will give way to stasis as the risk of a nuclear deal falling apart dissuades foreign companies from starting up business in or with @entity3			0
that is why the @entity2 must signal a shift in their approach to @entity3			2
that means not just relieving sanctions on a schedule agreed to in the negotiations , but also taking additional measures that persuade firms that there is a sea - change underfoot in the way the @entity162 deals with @entity3			2
for starters , the @entity2 should continue a dialogue that has been opened with the @entity3 for the first time in three - plus decades			2
it is no secret that the regional landscape has turned decisively in favor of @entity8 - @entity3 cooperation -- @entity73 is a mutual antagonist			1
continued negotiations on the range of outstanding issues could signal a change of pace between the two long - time adversaries			0
the @entity2 could also take discrete measures that instill confidence in firms interested in doing business with @entity3			2
this includes setting up a direct financial channel to select @entity3 financial institutions for the processing of licensed transactions			0
such a channel could be run from the @entity188 , which maintains correspondent relations with banks all over the world			0
this would ensure that @entity194 - licensed activities are able to be undertaken by @entity8 persons and would signal to @entity8 and foreign financial institutions alike that dealings with @entity3 are not as risk - prone as in the prior period			2
third , reach out and advise			0
fair or not , there is a lot of fear out there			0
most firms avoid @entity3 -- even when engagement is permitted -- out of terrified respect for @entity8 sanctions enforcers			1
that means there will need to be a lot of hand - holding to guide @entity8 and foreign firms through the thicket of rules and regulations providing @entity3 sanctions relief			1
most companies will need official assurance not once , not twice , but again and again , before undertaking transactions with or activities in @entity3			0
the @entity2 should be prepared to do the requisite outreach and ensure that both the @entity222 and @entity223 are well - staffed to advise firms on the scope of permissible activities			0
in spite of the wrong - headed advice of its closest allies , the @entity70 administration has courageously pursued the diplomatic path with @entity3			1
that political courage can not have been in vain			0
if , as a senior @entity70 administration official said this week , " the next two years will be transformative in ... [ the @entity8 - ] @entity3 relations ... , " then the @entity2 needs to first ensure that it upholds the @entity8 's end of a nuclear bargain			1
that means not just being prepared to offer @entity3 sanctions relief , but making sure that the relief sticks and its benefits inure to @entity3 and its people			1
there is no better way , after all , to avoid the outcome a nuclear @entity3 .			0

@entity2 's ability to provide @entity3 with sanctions relief is unclear , writes @entity249
