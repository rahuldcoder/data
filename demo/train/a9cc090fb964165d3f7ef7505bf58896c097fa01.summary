@entity0 -- one year in the job as the @entity5 supremo , @entity2 so far has presided over a relatively smooth transition of leadership			2
but what is his vision for the next 10 years , when he is expected to serve as paramount leader ? no one has a crystal ball that gives definitive clues			0
in the first few months since he took power , @entity2 has pushed a popular and arguably progressive agenda : attacking corruption , not just flies ( junior officials ) but a few tigers ( senior officials ) too ; curbing official extravagance , like senseless banqueting , and , one of my favorites , banning " empty speeches			0
" but in recent weeks , @entity2 has turned " left "			2
he allowed tighter control over the traditional and social media , silenced dissenting voices among academics and scholars , and cracked down on liberal activists , petitioners and protesters			0
at the same time , @entity2 has paid homage to chairman @entity36 and some of his preaching			1
he visited a few revolutionary shrines , endorsed the @entity40 practices of " criticism and self - criticism " -- ostensibly to purify the party ranks -- and advocated " mass line " campaigns to improve the party 's popularity among the people			0
analysts wonder : is @entity2 a @entity40 or a @entity50 ? is he a conservative or a reformist ? clearly , @entity2 is not a chairman @entity36 nor a @entity54			1
like his two predecessors -- @entity56 and @entity57 -- @entity2 is not a legendary revolutionary figure who can command absolute loyalty			0
in the current political system , he is merely a primus inter pares -- first among equals , who leads by consensus			1
left or right ? like @entity54 , @entity2 may not have to seek absolute dominance , a @entity36 , to be an effective leader			1
instead , he may just seek to find the center of the debate			0
still , unless and until there is fundamental political reform , @entity70 will remain a nation more dependent on the power of a single leader , a charismatic strongman , than on institutions			1
friends in @entity70 asked me these same questions , and my honest answer is : no one knows for sure , but i think @entity2 is signaling " left " so he can turn " right "			1
expectations of @entity2 were high on the eve of the @entity85 of the @entity5 's central committee , @entity70 's 300 - plus political elite , who last week met behind closed doors in @entity0			1
sinologists had drawn parallels to the @entity85 in 1978 , a landmark meeting that launched @entity54 's reform and open - door program			2
@entity70 media accounts on documents approved during the plenum signal significant changes : prickly issues @entity70 's top leaders have been deliberating these prickly issues for years , but decisions have been put off for lack of consensus or political will			1
that @entity2 was able to push these through this time , analysts say , indicates @entity2 's growing influence			1
the @entity85 has also agreed to set up two new institutions : the @entity107 on @entity108 and the @entity109			0
the security commission will be a supra - ministerial body that will take charge of over-arching security issues , including military and police matters , territorial disputes , cyber-attacks and ethnic unrest			0
@entity2 is expected to play a leading role in the two groups , even though premier @entity121 may head the economic reform commission			2
these institutions , analysts say , will allow @entity2 and his team to supervise the complex and often conflicting bureaucracies -- the @entity5 , the government , the military and police in a top - down authoritarian way			2
proponents of reform sound optimistic			0
endorsements the plenum gives market forces a " decisive role " that will allow enterprises and individuals to invest more overseas , economist @entity140 , an expert on international business and trade told me			0
the most significant endorsement came from @entity146 , the octogenarian guru of the @entity54 's reform program who also served as doctoral degree adviser of premier @entity121 at @entity149			0
speaking in @entity0 this week , @entity146 said the system set up by @entity70 in 1978 when @entity70 embarked on reform and opening was " the initial primary - stage version of market economy for the late 21st century , which still took on many vestiges of the old system			1
" the one put forth by @entity2 , he said , is " an upgraded version for a more mature market economy system that suits the current demands			2
" but analysts also caution against excessive optimism			0
it will take longer than expected to make these reforms work , says economist @entity166 , using the @entity70 maxim " @entity168 , zhi pa zhan " -- slowing down is not worrisome ; a standstill is			2
three decades ago , the late @entity5 leader @entity170 , a contemporary of @entity54 , likened the @entity70 economy to a bird and the @entity70 political system to a bird cage			1
while the cage may be enlarged to let the bird fly more freely , @entity170 argued , it must never be discarded			1
@entity2 and his cohorts seem to agree on that			0

far - reaching reform *package* indicates @entity2 's growing influence
but reforms come as @entity2 tightens media controls and pays homage to @entity36
*rhetoric* suggests @entity2 is signaling " left " so he can turn " right "
@entity70 political system likened to a bird cage : @entity191 can be enlarged but not discarded
