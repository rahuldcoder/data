" i think that when you keep these secrets , and something that you learn as you read more and go into treatments and get help is , that these secrets kill , " @entity1 told " et " monday			1
" nobody wants to out themselves , so to speak			2
or if they out themselves , it 's in a very @entity31 way			0

" and when you have a job like @entity1 's , some assume that you would n't be prone to depression to begin with			1
" i just did my 1,001st show of ' @entity41			0
' but then i would turn it into this thing of , ' man , i 'm doing " @entity41 " when i could be doing this sitcom , ' " @entity1 said			1
" folks think , ' @entity1 's always happy			1
' no , i 'm not always happy , because i 'm human			0

just a brother in his underwear , in his room crying			0
on that birthday was the beginning of ' ok , i 've got to make a change			0
' " now , @entity1 says he hopes that his admission will help someone else			1
" i talked about it ( because ) i know not everyone is lucky enough to have a support system to talk , and and you may have a wall up that stands between you and help , " @entity1 said			2
" it may be pride , cultural stigma , shame or just plain old ' i 've got this ! ' i 've had all the above ! if me talking about my personal journey helps someone , it 's all worth it			2
