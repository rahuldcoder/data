" we are utilizing that force to enable us to create a substantial force around @entity0 , that if it is required , we 'll be able to mobilize as soon as possible , " @entity3 spokesman @entity42 told @entity1 's @entity43			1
the @entity5 cabinet has authorized the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed			2
that is 10,000 more than were called up during @entity5 's offensive into @entity0 in november 2012			1
government spokesman @entity51 said units have been deployed			0
" we 're ready to go , if we need to go , " he told @entity43			0
@entity51 said @entity5 did n't want a situation where @entity31 , which controls @entity0 , was given a " timeout " where it could regroup before restarting its attacks			1

" without the prospect of an end to the conflict , the sides will grow ever more polarized			0
" ' prepared for all options ' there have been hints for days from some @entity5 officials about the possibility of a ground offensive in @entity0 , but there were questions about the government 's appetite for such a conflict			1
@entity156 said wednesday that the aerial offensive would be expanded and continue " until the firing at our communities stops and quiet is restored			0
" he did n't specify what the expansion of @entity197 would entail , saying that @entity5 's military " is prepared for all possibilities			2

" allegations by @entity5 that @entity32 are using human shields are " audacious , " he said , and he rejected the argument that @entity5 is defending itself			1
@entity5 " deliberately carries out reprisals and collective punishment against the @entity32 people in declared retaliation and revenge ... for the killing of the three @entity5 settlers , which the @entity32 leadership has clearly condemned , " @entity233 said			1
@entity5 , for its part , called on the @entity230 to condemn @entity31 and its launching of rockets across the border			0
@entity253 , @entity5 ambassador to the @entity170 , played a recording of a siren during the middle of his remarks , to show how @entity5 only have 15 seconds , he said , to run for cover			0
