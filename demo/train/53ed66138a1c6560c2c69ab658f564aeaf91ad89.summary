-- as secretary of state @entity2 steps down from her job friday , many are assuming she will run for president			1
in fact , five of the first eight presidents first served their predecessors as secretary of state			1
it has n't happened in more than a century , though that may change should @entity12 decide to run			1
after all , she has been a game changer her entire life			2
but before we look ahead , i think we should appreciate what she 's done as secretary of state ; it 's a high profile , high pressure job			1
you have to deal with the routine as if it is critical and with crisis as if it 's routine			2
you have to manage egos , protocols , customs and @entity30			2
you have to be rhetorical and blunt , diplomatic and direct			2
as secretary of state you are dealing with heads of state and with we the people			1
and the president of the @entity36 has to trust you -- implicitly			2
on the road with @entity2 of all @entity12 's accomplishments -- and i will mention just a few -- this may be the most underappreciated			1
during the election , pundits were puzzled and amazed not only at how much energy former president @entity12 poured into @entity46 's campaign , but even more at how genuine and close the friendship was			1
@entity46 was given a lot of well - deserved credit for reaching out to the @entity50 by appointing then - sen. @entity2 as his secretary of state in the first place			1
but trust is a two - way street and has to be earned			0
we should not underestimate or forget how much @entity12 did and how hard she worked			1
she deserved that trust , as she deserved to be in the war room when @entity59 was killed			0
by the way , is there any other leader in the last 50 years whom we routinely refer to by a first name , and do so more out of respect than familiarity ? the last person i can think of was @entity68 -- the elder family member who we revere with affection			0
it 's not surprising that we feel we know her			0
she has been part of our public life for more than 20 years			0
she 's been a model of dignity , diplomacy , empathy and toughness			0
she also has done something no other secretary of state has done -- including the two women who preceded her in the @entity82 post			1
@entity83 : president @entity2 ? if she wants it @entity2 has transformed our understanding -- no , our definition -- of foreign affairs			1
diplomacy is no longer just the skill of managing relations with other countries			0
the big issues -- war and peace , terror , economic stability , etc. -- remain , and she has handled them with firmness and authority , with poise and confidence , and with good will , when appropriate			0
but it is not the praise of diplomats or dictators that will be her legacy			0
she dealt with plenipotentiaries , but her focus was on people			1
foreign affairs is n't just about treaties , she taught us , it 's about the suffering and aspirations of those affected by the treaties , made or unmade			2
most of all , diplomacy should refocus attention on the powerless			0
of course , @entity2 was n't the first secretary of state to advocate for human rights or use the post to raise awareness of abuses or negotiate humanitarian relief or pressure oppressors			1
but she was the first to focus on empowerment , particularly of women and girls			1
she created the first @entity132			0
that office fought to highlight the plight of women around the world			1
rape of women has been a weapon of war for centuries			2
though civilized countries condemn it , the fight against it has in a sense only really begun			0
@entity147 : @entity2 's global legacy on gay rights the office has worked to hold governments accountable for the systematic oppression of girls and women and fought for their education in emerging countries			1
as @entity2 said when the office was established : " when the @entity158 passed @entity159 , we tried to make a very clear statement , that women are still largely shut out of the negotiations that seek to end conflicts , even though women and children are the primary victims of 21st century conflict			2
" @entity2 also included the @entity36 in the trafficking in @entity169 report			0
@entity170 , a form of modern , mainly sexual , slavery , victimizes mostly women and girls			1
the annual report reviews the state of global efforts to eliminate the practice			2
" we believe it is important to keep the spotlight on ourselves , " she said			0
" human trafficking is not someone else 's problem			0
involuntary servitude is not something we can ignore or hope does n't exist in our own communities			0
" she also created the office of @entity191			0
and there is much more			0
she has held her own in palaces and held the hands of hungry children in mud - hut villages , pursuing an agenda that empowers women , children , the poor and helpless			2
we should n't have been surprised			0
her book " @entity203 " focused on the impact that those outside the family have , for better or worse , on a child 's well - being			0
as secretary of state , she did all she could to make sure our impact as a nation would be for the better			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 : @entity12 stepping down as secretary of state . maybe she *'ll* run for president
she says as secretary she *expanded* foreign *policy* to include effect on regular people
she says she was first secretary of state to focus on empowering women and girls
@entity214 : @entity12 has fought for education and inclusion in politics for women and girls
