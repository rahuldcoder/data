-- let me bring you up to date in @entity3 : the home football team pulverized the @entity7 on national television monday night , its crowd making so much noise , quarterback @entity4 of the visitors must have felt his eardrums were about to explode			1
as for the home baseball team -- uh , well , if you think @entity3 's football crowd was loud on monday , you should 've heard the crowd with @entity15 - at - the - bat on tuesday			1
here 's what happened , in case you missed it			0
i fear you might have missed it , because : ( 1			0
) this was a @entity15 baseball game , which does n't normally attract a whole lot of tv viewers outside our fine states of @entity27 and @entity3 , and ( 2			1
) the score was 7 - 3 in favor of the @entity30 in the eighth inning , so perhaps by then you had changed your tv channel to @entity0 or some other fine network			2
anyhow , doom and gloom seemed imminent for the really overdue @entity15 , who had finally made it to the @entity39 playoffs for the first time since way back in 1985			1
i felt disappointment and was n't sure why			0
i have nothing against @entity30 , a first - rate baseball team and town that has n't won a @entity45 since way back in 1989			2
i am not anti-a 's			0
i just felt lousy for those true - blue , @entity49 - loyal , long - suffering @entity48			2
ahh , but then : @entity50 hit a single to make the score 7 - 4			2
@entity53 singled to make it 7 - 5			0
@entity55 hustled home on a wild pitch to make it 7 - 6			0
as you might imagine -- like i say , in case you were n't watching -- @entity48 's crowd went as wild as that pitch			0
in the ninth inning , @entity63 of the @entity15 hit a ball to deep right field			1
it enabled a bubbly @entity68 to race excitedly from third base and make the score 7 - up			0
in the 12th inning , after giving up a run and again looking as done as a flame - broiled steak , @entity15 cooked up a masterpiece			1
@entity75 , a 24 - year - old catcher from @entity76 , @entity77 , came up with a walk - off single for an unlikely 9 - 8 @entity3 victory			1
it touched off a celebration -- if not in @entity77 -- that definitely had people dancing in the streets from @entity85 to @entity86 to @entity87 to @entity88			0
it was one of those sappy , happy endings that reminded you of how enjoyable baseball can be			0
because it 's always so much better when everything 's on the line , when it 's not just a tuesday night in may or june but a genuine , nerve - racking , no - tomorrow - if - you - lose october game that looks completely lost before being magnificently won			1
like a lot of @entity101 living far , far away from our heroes of the hour , i would n't know @entity75 or @entity63 or @entity50 if any of them walked into this room right now to bring me an autographed ball			0
i now find myself , overnight , appreciative of them , of all those kool @entity48 kids , for treating us to this majestic @entity49 engagement			0
when they play the @entity109 next in these @entity111 playoffs , their names will be as familiar in my household as those of @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 of the @entity118 gang , each decidedly more famous in @entity39 , @entity101			0
thirty years ago ( i being a seriously old dude ) , i flew to @entity3 for a league championship series			1
the names of those @entity15 were not household ones -- @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 -- but it was a pretty solid ball club			2
it had above - average pitching and a third baseman , @entity129 , in his prime and on his way to the @entity132			0
loss , loss , loss : three strikes and the 1984 @entity15 were out , eliminated by the @entity137 in a best - of - five series in the blink of an eye			1
but baseball was on the upswing in @entity3			2
a year later , hopelessly behind to the @entity143 in the @entity144 and again to the @entity145 in the @entity45 , the relentless @entity15 became kings of the baseball world			2
they stayed alive with a thrilling ninth - inning rally for a 2 - 1 win in game 6 , then took game 7 of the @entity152 by clobbering the @entity145 11 - 0			1
@entity3 partied , baby ! then never did again			2
no more october playoffs , even			0
combine that with no @entity164 in the 1980s , ' 90s or 21st century from the @entity163 , no pro hockey or basketball , plus the added rub of watching the fans of that other @entity27 baseball team ( @entity160 ) cheering and high - fiving and watching strutting @entity162 year after year			1
everything was definitely not up - to - date in @entity3 , which apparently had gone as far as it could go			1
as dark as when the local team was known as the @entity30 in the late 1950s and carpetbagger ownership began looking for a way to move it to the @entity173 before the @entity168 or @entity169 could beat them to it			0
as bad as when @entity15 kept trading top players like @entity176 and @entity177 to those @entity178 for practically nothing in return			2
as maddening as when owner @entity181 did move the whole shebang to @entity30 in 1968 , leaving @entity3 temporarily without a team			2
lawmakers led by sen. @entity185 pressured baseball into giving @entity48 a replacement team , pronto			0
thus were born the @entity15 , whose first game on april 8 , 1969 , was a victory in 12 innings			1
not as awesome a 12 - inning victory as tuesday night 's , but a nice win nonetheless			1
it was the dawn of a new era of @entity3 ball , one of powder - blue road uniforms instead of garish green - and - gold ones , one of division championships from 1976 - 78 and a @entity45 appearance in 1980			1
a lot of impressive players came along , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 -- the mighty @entity208 wore the royal blue for a while			0
free - spending owners turned into penny - pinchers			1
valuable properties like @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 played , but never stayed			0
embarrassing records piled up , 64 - 97 one year , 62 - 100 another , a gruesome 56 - 106 season in 2005			0
would the poor @entity15 never be flush again ? well , while fans elsewhere were distracted by @entity223 's long goodbye in @entity224 , or by the @entity226 ' rise , or by the @entity228 ' fall , or on the successes of the affluent @entity231 teams and the comparatively picayune @entity232 one , a heartwarming story was developing in the heartland			1
@entity3 was hanging in there , holding its own against the rich @entity137 and @entity178 and @entity235 and all those other big - budget operations			1
tuesday night 's triumph in the @entity111 playoff opener turned more than a few @entity101 into brand new royal backers , you can bet on that			2
@entity243 - to - coast woke up wednesday morning buzzing about @entity3 , something that does n't happen very often			1
" when 's the next @entity15 game ? " somebody out there must be asking right about now			1
thursday night in @entity118 is the answer , at 9:07 et , 6:07 pt , and that 'll be 8:07 in @entity3 , for all of you there ready to make some more noise			1
( note : an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect age for @entity75			0
) join us on @entity258 / @entity257 .			0
