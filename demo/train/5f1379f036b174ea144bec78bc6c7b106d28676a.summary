-- @entity1 set a date with the @entity3 in the last 16 of the @entity4 as the curtain fell on the gripping group stages in @entity7 , while @entity8 celebrated a historic first			1
thursday 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity11 was more than enough for the unbeaten @entity12 to advance from @entity13 as winners , despite having a man sent off			1
as their red and yellow clad fans celebrated in @entity19 , there were similar scenes of jubilation in @entity22			0
@entity8 made history in @entity7 , reaching the knockout stages of the global tournament for the first time at the expense of @entity28			1
" @entity8 " -- the @entity8 -- will need all their wiles as they face the might of @entity32 next			2
@entity32 had consigned the @entity3 to a 1 - 0 defeat in thursday 's earlier matches but @entity35 escaped from a grueling @entity36 -- which also featured @entity37 and @entity38 -- on goal difference			1
@entity1 might think themselves lucky to march into the knockout stages with their unbeaten record intact after being forced to play more than half the match with 10 men			1
@entity45 was sent off for a rash studs - up challenge on the cusp of halftime and @entity11 sniffed blood , pressing forward after the break			2
but if the statistics tell us anything about @entity1 , it is never count them out			0
breaking upfield , defender @entity56 picked up the rebound of @entity59 's fizzing effort to break the deadlock after 77 minutes			1
@entity1 's last six @entity4 goals have been scored in the last 20 minutes of the match			1
@entity35 better be prepared for a lively finish when the two sides meet next tuesday in @entity65			0
@entity8 had arrived in @entity19 buoyant from a 4 - 2 victory over @entity11 -- the @entity68 country 's first @entity4 win in 32 years			1
when @entity28 took an early lead in the must - win showdown , a fairytale ending for @entity71 's side had seemed a remote possibility			1
@entity75 , who is nicknamed " @entity79 " because of his youthful similarity to the @entity78 pop star , was soon on song			0
he rose brilliantly to power home @entity82 's cross after just six minutes and from there @entity28 looked intent on protecting the lead			0
but @entity8 , cheered on by the undiminished enthusiasm of their fans , were not done yet			0
when a free - kick was swung into the box , the @entity90 defense rocked and @entity93 headed into an open goal with 60 minutes on the clock -- his second goal in as many games			1
the draw was enough for @entity8 to join @entity98 as the second @entity68 side in the last 16			2
meanwhile , @entity28 will be hoping to find answers before hosting the next @entity4 in 2018			2
after failing to qualify for the 2006 and 2010 editions of the global football fiesta , the @entity90 have now fallen at the first hurdle in 1994 , 2002 and 2014			0
the remaining 16 nations in the @entity4 will enjoy a rest day friday before the footballing fever gets even hotter on saturday			2
hosts @entity7 face a tricky @entity108 side for a place in the quarterfinals while @entity111 take on @entity112 , now rendered rather toothless by the ban for biting striker @entity114			0
the controversial @entity116 player is not the only star name to take an early flight from @entity7			0
@entity38 star @entity119 , @entity121 's defending champions and 2006 winners @entity123 were among the big guns saying adeus from @entity7 .			0

@entity1 set up last 16 date with the @entity3 at @entity128 in @entity7
a solitary goal by @entity12 defender @entity56 seals 1 - 0 win over @entity11
*algeria* reach the knockout stages of the @entity4 for the first time in their history
a late *equalizer* for @entity93 sees @entity8 advance as the expense of @entity28
