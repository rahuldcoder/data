it was meant as a joke , but @entity3 inadvertently cut to the chase with the perception hanging over world football as it wrestles with the decision as to re-elect @entity9 president @entity8 or opt for a new beginning			1
" do we have any football questions ? " quipped the @entity11 , as he launched his bid to become head of an organization whose reputation has taken a bit battering in recent years			2
yes , there was last year 's @entity20 , which garnered plenty of plaudits , but invariably when @entity9 's name crops up it 's to do with the rights and wrongs of its decision to award the next two competitions to @entity29 and @entity30			1
so as a light dusting of snow slowly melted outside a swanky @entity35 hotel , prince @entity31 turned up the heat on the current head of world football			2
" i think the main point is to have a new culture " @entity31 told @entity1 in an interview after he addressed the media for the first time since announcing his intention to run			2
" it 's about not having the game controlled by people 's personal opinions or the whims of the president			0
it needs to be inclusive for all			0
" at the moment a spirit of inclusion is not altogether apparent in @entity9 's corridors of power , with ethics investigator @entity57 resigning in december to protest the handling of his own report into @entity30 and @entity29 's successful bids for the 2018 and 2022 @entity61			2
the string of controversies have put @entity9 's internal politics at the front and center of the presidential race			1
prince @entity31 spoke of a " culture of intimidation " within @entity9 , with some national associations fearing retribution if they back any other candidate other than @entity8 , though he did n't provide specific examples			1
@entity9 declined to comment when contacted by @entity1 over prince @entity31 's " intimidation " reference			1
a vice president of the @entity77 , @entity11 was the only country from that continent to lend its backing to @entity31 , who relied on @entity81 , the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 to complete his bid			2
his campaign is being masterminded by @entity88 , a public relations company that also has a wider communications brief working with @entity91 , the @entity92 confederation within @entity9			0
" i 've tried as much as i can to reform it from within ... having seen what 's happened i 'm not going to allow another four years of this , " prince @entity31 said of @entity9 's internal workings			1
as well as @entity8 , prince @entity31 is up against former @entity98 captain -- and 2001 's @entity99 -- @entity100 , who says he who was convinced to stand after @entity9 's handling of the @entity57 report			1
also running is the head of @entity107 soccer , @entity108 , 67 , who has openly called for @entity8 to stand down , taking it upon himself to restore what he sees as a lack of trustworthiness in the organization			1
if elected , the 39 - year - old prince @entity31 could become the first muslim to lead @entity9 in its 101 - year history			1
he previously led calls for @entity9 to lift its ban on the hijab that was preventing many @entity113 women from following their football dreams			0
" i 've been a huge supporter of the women 's game -- across the world , " he said			0
" it 's the biggest growth area in football right now			0
it needs to be taken much more seriously , and i 'm willing and committed to doing so			0
" prince @entity31 was also keen to stress his commitment to ridding football of any form of prejudice			0
" i think that there should be no discrimination in football in any way , shape or form , " he added			0
whilst the @entity11 prince is out and proud about his intentions , this may not be enough to challenge @entity8 's 16 - year dynasty			1
in the meantime @entity31 had better get used to talking politics , as it seems football is off the agenda .			0
