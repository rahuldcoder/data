-- last week , after the @entity4 defeated a measure to authorize the @entity6 by a single vote , a @entity2 sitting in the gallery broke into a traditional victory song			2
@entity9 , of @entity10 and @entity12 heritage , was quickly detained and hauled out of the @entity13			2
but the biggest slight to @entity14 came not from @entity16 's arrest for bursting into a victory song in honor of the senators who voted against the bill but from some of the media coverage of the incident			1
" once i was released , i found out the media [ was ] saying there was an outburst of a @entity2 wailing and chanting , " @entity16 said			2
a chant ? really ? did @entity31 chant ? does @entity32 ? of course not			2
so why is it that when a @entity2 begins to sing , and if the song is not in @entity37 , people immediately assume it is just some kind of wordless wailing ? for future reference , @entity14 sing , we do n't chant			1
here 's the thing : november is @entity42 , as it has been since 1990 following a decree by then - president @entity45			1
so this should be the time of the year when people learn about @entity14 , our significant contributions to this country , and maybe even the appropriate language to use in the 21st century			1
( @entity52 is a bad word , and so is -- you guessed it -- redskin )			0
opinion : what you do n't know about @entity59 sadly , i ca n't help but worry that this column will be the only thing that many people will read about @entity42			1
so please bear with me , while i take a moment to mention someone i hope will not be forgotten -- @entity66 , the first female chief of the @entity67 and a champion of access to clean water			0
@entity66 was brave and brazen and is now the subject of the new film , " @entity73			0
" i recently chatted about her with @entity74 - winning singer - songwriter @entity75 , who donated a song to the film and is an admirer of the late chief			0
" @entity66 's just one of my heroes , " @entity75 said			0
@entity81 , the revered feminist and journalist , echoed these warm words			0
" from my perspective , " she said , " [ @entity66 ] should 've been president of the @entity85			0
" @entity66 was the epitome of determination , and so it irks me that so few @entity14 have heard about her diplomacy , eloquence and backbone -- especially during a month when we all should be recognizing indigenous people like her for their prowess and influence			1
then again , i also remember what @entity16 said when i asked him why @entity42 barely gets a mention compared with , say , @entity99 or @entity100			1
" we 're first nations people , " he said			0
" they do n't value us as much			0
in fact , @entity103 falls on the one day each year when @entity14 ravenously indulge in material possessions -- @entity106			1
so is this an insult to @entity14 ? of course it is			1
how could it not be ? if @entity103 fell on november 5 , for example , then students would be in the classroom and teachers could offer lessons about the @entity2 today			2
but no , instead streams of bundled up shoppers are standing in line to make their purchases , with the class the last thing on any kids ' mind as they sit watching tv			0
if we 're going to choose a day for @entity103 when school is out , then how about @entity59 itself ? why not ? that way we could learn about the real history of the holiday , and not the romanticized version we all hear about			1
or maybe that discussion is too real , too much of a downer for people to stomach on @entity59			2
i mean , i get it -- i 'm sure it 's tough to hear that the first @entity59 in @entity137 was in celebration of the subduing of @entity14 or that the pilgrims decapitated the son of the guest and sent his head to @entity144 to be displayed on a pike just outside the colony 's entrance , where it would stay rotting for two decades			1
too gruesome ? maybe that 's a good thing			0
facts are facts , and rejecting them bodes ill for everyone			0
so , this @entity42 , tell a family member or friend that @entity14 sing , they do n't chant			1
let them know that the pilgrims were themselves illegal immigrants who documented themselves			0
talk a bit about how @entity66 was a warrior and dedicated environmentalist			0
and remind someone that @entity14 have contributed to this country since the first white man stepped off the boat and refused to learn our languages			1

november is @entity42
@entity170 : the months should be a time for learning of natives ' contributions
however , many @entity14 remain ignorant of real history , he says
