@entity0 , @entity1 -- the evacuation of the tens of thousands of refugees who have streamed across the @entity7 border to @entity1 has stepped up dramatically			1
@entity1 authorities have established an air bridge from a provincial airport on the island of @entity0 that is now moving out thousands of migrants a day			1
" we are expecting 10,000 passengers to leave every day with 66 movements , that 's to say 66 planes , " said @entity0 airport director @entity13 told @entity2			1
" the majority go to @entity20			0
but there are also @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 in the beginning but now they all seem to have left			0
there are many nationalities and many destinations			0
" as of thursday , more than 172,000 people had left @entity7 , most of them migrant workers returning home , the @entity33 's emergency relief coordinator , @entity32 , said in a statement issued friday			1
among them were women and children , she said			0
the @entity33 ' figure was slightly less than that of the @entity43 , which has been working with the @entity33 refugee agency and estimated that 200,000 people had fled @entity7			1
some of those crossing the border told @entity2 that government forces in @entity49 had confiscated their mobile phones and cameras			0
a majority of those fleeing are @entity20 who had been working in @entity7			1
but the foreign workers also include citizens of other nations including @entity25 , @entity57 , @entity26 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
a @entity62 official said approximately 90,000 people were in transit camps over the @entity7 border in @entity1			1
almost half of them are @entity20 , said the official , who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record			2
closer to the @entity20 border , in the eastern city of @entity72 , about 8,000 foreigners awaited evacuation			0
they included @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , according to the refugee agency			0
" they appear to have gathered spontaneously and are camping together for security as they await , " refugee agency spokeswoman @entity78 said in a statement			0
she said most of those people will be evacuated within two days			2
another 110,000 people inside @entity7 have been affected by the crisis , the @entity84 said friday			1
it appealed for $ 26 million to help those inside the country and those in @entity1			1
the agency said it will use the money for food , water , medical care , sanitation and hygiene items			0
as the violence has escalated in the past few days , @entity99 military aircraft and @entity101 charter jets have scrambled to evacuate tens of thousands from the north @entity104 nation			0
in @entity106 , president @entity105 said he has approved the use of @entity99 military aircraft to help @entity20 who have fled the unrest to return home			1
he said he authorized the @entity62 to charter additional planes			0
" tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing @entity7 , and we commend the governments of @entity1 and @entity20 for their response , even as they go through their own political transitions , " @entity105 said			1
the @entity119 announced that two planes carrying humanitarian supplies were being dispatched friday to @entity1 in what has been dubbed @entity123 ; the planes were carrying blankets , rolls of sheeting and water cans			1
@entity2 learned that a @entity130 cargo plane labeled with a @entity99 flag landed in @entity1			1
@entity13 stood in the departure hall of an airport that normally welcomes sun - hungry @entity135 tourists traveling to the wind - swept beaches of @entity0 's @entity139 coast			2
instead , the hall was filled with hundreds of tired and dirty migrant workers			0
some camped out on the floor on blankets			0
others stood in orderly lines in front of a booth normally reserved for car rental companies and money exchange , which instead held @entity1 volunteers distributing sandwiches , fruit and water to the arrivals			1
" of the 50,000 refugees who have come through here " since the crisis began , @entity13 said , " everybody has been given shelter and food at the airport			2
" the conditions at the airport were dramatically better than the scene that awaited many migrants immediately after entering @entity1 from @entity7			1
on thursday , more than 5,000 @entity25 men were camped out in a vacant lot next to the border gate , huddled under blankets next to a fetid pond of muddy water as howling winds whipped dust through the compound			0
@entity1 authorities and volunteers distributed food and water			1
a tent city that serves as a transit center was erected this week some 10 kilometers from the border			0
but the camp can hold only some 15,000 people -- that 's how many people are estimated to have arrived in a single day and not near enough to accommodate all those in need			2
still , conditions have improved dramatically since wednesday , when @entity7 authorities began regulating the flow of refugees across the border			1
instead of allowing them to mass by the thousands in front of the @entity1 border gate , refugees must now approach the border with @entity1 in orderly groups in single file			1
the @entity33 refugee agency said friday that the number of civilians fleeing the violence in @entity7 to @entity1 " has dropped significantly since wednesday afternoon , " with armed , pro-government forces manning the @entity7 side			1
compared with earlier in the week , when 10,000 to 15,000 people were crossing daily into @entity1 , fewer than 2,000 made it across on thursday and about the same number did so on friday , the agency said			1
the @entity33 high commissioner for refugees said it was " very concerned that the security situation in @entity7 may be preventing people from fleeing			1
" the @entity7 government appeared eager to show off the orderly border			1
officials bused in a group of foreign journalists from @entity49 thursday afternoon as part of a guided tour of the frontier region			0
but , upon their arrival in @entity20 , dozens of refugees have said they had been robbed at @entity7 checkpoints			1
many said that , as they sought to get out of @entity7 , they were stopped and searched by @entity7 security forces who confiscated their cell phones and computers			2
many refugees also accused @entity7 police and soldiers of having robbed them at gunpoint			2
" i have no passport , only a passport photocopy , " said @entity231			0
the 29 - year - old man sat on the floor of the airport with more than 100 @entity25 -- all of them awaiting a flight home			2
he wore a uniform labeled " @entity241 , " the name of the supply company that paid him $ 250 a month to work in @entity7			2
" the @entity7 people take my money and passport and all the time say ' i will kill you , i will kill you , ' " @entity245 said , speaking in broken @entity246			1
" i am run away ( for ) my life			0
" like many @entity25 migrant workers , @entity245 had borrowed some $ 4,000 to pay employment agencies to give him a job in @entity7			2
upon their arrival in @entity7 , many migrant workers were forced to hand over their passports to their employers			2
human rights groups have denounced such practices , arguing they amount to little more than indentured servitude			0
the flight back to @entity25 for @entity245 and his fellow migrants will be free , but he and many of his fellow @entity25 face crushing debts			2
" we are very helpless now ; we are beggars now , " @entity245 said			0
@entity0 airport officials said 25 flights were scheduled to take off friday for @entity272			0
the @entity101 government has helped with the @entity20 airlift by chartering several passenger planes to @entity272			0
a number of charter flights are scheduled as well to @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity22 , @entity26 and @entity280 .			0

" we are helpless now "
@entity33 estimates 172,000 people have fled @entity7
most of them are migrants returning home
10,000 are expected to leave daily , a @entity1 airport official says
