-- a last - minute and unexpected change in government rules over a key environmental dispute prompted uncertainty and consternation at the @entity6 on monday , with justices chastising the @entity9 administration over its policy tactics			1
final rules issued by the @entity12 on friday exempted logging road runoff from storm water permit requirements , saying timber firms may continue to use " best management practices " that suit local conditions			1
the change came just ahead of monday 's oral arguments on one of two cases this week dealing with the financial and health effects of storm water drainage			2
" maybe in the future you could let us know when something as definite as that comes " at the last minute , chief justice @entity25 told the @entity27 's lawyer			0
@entity25 suggested that arguments could have been delayed so that the court and both sides of the case could prepare			1
photos : 15 @entity6 cases that changed @entity39 at issue was whether logging road operators must obtain federal clean water act discharge permits for ditches , drains , and culverts channeling rain runoff from those roads -- treating it the same as industrial storm water			1
scientists have said such sediment from muddy water -- created in part by large logging trucks -- can prove deadly to fish , plants and other wildlife , often many miles downstream from the initial source			1
a small environmental group from @entity60 first sued over dirt roads in the @entity62 , near streams where threatened salmon migrate			1
that includes the @entity66 and @entity67			0
the @entity69 - based @entity68 last year won an important victory in a federal appeals court			2
but state officials and timber companies then asked the high court to intervene , saying changes in long - established federal rules would be overly burdensome and cost jobs in the already financially stressed timber market in the @entity79			1
the @entity80 generally prohibits any pollutants being discharged by companies or individuals into @entity39 waters , unless a government permit has been issued			0
such " pollutants " can include rock , sand , and contaminated soil			0
small - scale family farm runoff traditionally receives less scrutiny than an industrial factory or mine			0
the question before the court is where forestry activities should fall on regulatory scale when it comes to the permitting process			2
the @entity9 administration is backing @entity60 and the timber industry , but also told the court in recent weeks that @entity103 and the @entity12 were working to minimize any further environmental damage , without an additional regulatory scheme			1
@entity25 noted it would be an " unusual situation " for the court to now try and rule following the regulatory bombshell -- when the key point of contention has now apparently become moot			2
but @entity111 , the attorney for @entity60 , urged the justices to continue deciding the matter despite the @entity12 action			2
" are you sure you want what you 're asking for , " said @entity25			0
" what if we go ahead and decide this case and rule against you ? " photos : @entity25 on the high court some justices seemed prepared to do so after @entity111 insisted " timber harvesting is not industrial activity " that would likely trigger permits			1
the lawyer for the environmentalists said in light of all the recent rule changes , the easiest thing would be for the high court to dismiss the industry appeal -- which would mean a victory for the environmental coalition			1
some on the bench were skeptical that was a practical alternative			0
the justices tuesday will tackle another ongoing dispute over whether water on a navigable river that flows through a concrete channel -- or an " engineered improvement " -- can be considered " discharge " subject to greater @entity80 regulation			0
that appeals concerns responsibility over billions of gallons of polluted storm water flowing into the @entity152 and @entity151			0
monday 's consolidated cases are @entity154 v. @entity68 ( 11 - 338 ) and @entity155 ( 11 - 347 ) .			0

@entity12 rule finalized just before @entity6 arguments in logging case
scientists say sediment related to logging can harm fish , plants
environmental group won appeals case , state ; industry sought high court intervention
