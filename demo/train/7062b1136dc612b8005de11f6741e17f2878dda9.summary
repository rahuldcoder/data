in @entity1 and in particular for supporters of @entity4 football club , the name of @entity6 is synonymous with greatness			1
even though my generation never actually saw him play , we were able to access plenty of archive footage in which he showcased his skill on the pitch			0
but the real insight came from generations before me , like my parents or grandparents			0
through them , i was able to learn about the man and athlete known to the world as " a @entity25 " ( @entity26 )			0
those stories still resonate till this day almost like fairy tales			0
the young kid who ended up traveling almost 5,000 miles to pursue his passion for soccer and ended up with a lot more than he bargained for			0
the teen striker moved to @entity1 at the age of 18 , after a former @entity36 footballer working at the time as a scout , told @entity4 's manager @entity38 about his promising talents			1
since joining the team in 1960 up until 1975 , @entity6 won 11 league titles , one @entity42 , five @entity44 cups , among several other team and individual records			1
people would say he was the best player to ever grace @entity1 with his talent			0
that the way he exploded on the pitch with his fast pace combined with the power of his right foot was a joy to watch			0
adding his phenomenal stats with 733 goals , including 41 for country , it then became obvious we were talking about one of the greats			1
it did n't take me long to understand what people meant every time they spoke about him			1
a few @entity72 clips could easily testify to this and go as far as to reveal that such attributes would still make him a star , even in today 's game			1
his success on the pitch , however , took on massive proportions , as it was not a mere sporting achievement			0
it was proof that @entity1 was able to produce great talent and conquer new and different horizons			0
it gave people hope , happiness and some comfort , which was all much needed at the time			2
during the period when @entity6 burst onto the scene , @entity1 was going through a rough stage under the decades - long dictatorship of @entity95			1
only what was known as the " three @entity97 's : " @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 ( the @entity101 ) would cheer the masses			2
so the level of success that @entity1 enjoyed under the leadership of @entity6 was crucial as a distraction that kept the population together			1
it is therefore no surprise that many people from all over the country admired @entity6 , regardless of the club they supported			1
as years went by and my passion for the game of soccer grew stronger , the " @entity117 " ( his other nickname ) life and career became even more appealing to me			2
i ca n't deny that a big part of it has to do with my allegiance to @entity4 , the club for which the @entity125 - born @entity44 footballer played 15 out of his 22 years as a professional athlete			1
it was obvious that this love affair would continue after his career ended			2
after retiring , he was offered a role as an ambassador , which he played until his last breath			0
equally , he also acted worldwide as a spokesperson for the game			0
the part seemed fitting for a man of his skills			0
more than just making use of his legendary status , as a man he was known for being a humble , kind and tremendously charismatic , making him very popular across the country as well as beyond our own borders			2
it is then no surprise that , on january 5th , the world reacted with shock to the news of his passing at the age of 71			1
soon after , i was called by @entity0 to travel to @entity159 in order to cover the story			1
i remember having mixed feelings at the time			2
on one hand i was saddened by the news , but on the other hand i felt incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to cover the story by attending his funeral from a journalistic standpoint			0
this had a very special meaning , as it allowed me to also pay my respects as a long - time admirer			1
i was able to witness how his death brought the country closer together			2
it was beautiful to see the amount of people that followed the coffin or showed up at the church			0
the crowds assembling close to his statue at the @entity188 , statue which by the way was covered from head to toe with flowers and scarves from various @entity44 clubs , as a sign of admiration			1
you could say that on that day , even the biggest soccer fanatic was colour - blind			2
there was no @entity4 , @entity201 or @entity202 -- there was only a unified country ! at a time when @entity1 is facing a long , hard financial depression -- which has not only affected our country 's economy , but also our spirits -- it was remarkable to see that , even if just for a few days , fans -- including longtime rivals -- were paying homage to a man they 've learned to respect and admire for his talent and flair , but also for his personality			1
his name is still very much present in the culture of not only the club , but the country			1
being such a timeless character , i can only wait for the time where i tell my kids the same stories i was told growing up			0
it is an ongoing way of celebrating his life			0
