-- you might remember the ad campaign " @entity3 knows baseball			0
" but these days sports legend @entity6 knows charity			1
@entity6 has dedicated his post- pro-sports days to raising money to help restore the areas of his native @entity11 devastated by a tornado in april 2011			1
he is also raising awareness on how to protect yourself and others from deadly storms			0
@entity6 recalls that day : " i was in @entity17 , where i live , and i ca n't remember what i was doing but i got phone calls from relatives and friends saying there 's a bad storm -- a big tornado			1
a mile - wide tornado demolished much of @entity27 , @entity11 , and the surrounding areas on april 27 , 2011			1
this killer tornado was a part of a bigger storm system that left more than 300 people dead in the @entity33			0
@entity6 remembers a conversation he had with his sister in the aftermath			2
" she said the storm was bad but everybody in our little town was ok			0
but other towns like @entity27 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 -- they got hit pretty hard , " @entity6 says			1
rocked by the news , @entity6 , a native of @entity46 , @entity11 , who starred in football and baseball at @entity50 , knew he could n't just sit idly by as the community that supported him in his climb to success was now in ruins			1
" i sat up and thought about what i can do to give back to my community , my state			2
and i came up with this harebrained idea to ride a bicycle across the state , " @entity6 says			1
his idea became reality with the creation of @entity65			2
@entity6 and his friends rode across the state to raise money not only to help rebuild but also to build community storm shelters			1
" @entity65 is an event where i want to make the rest of the country aware of just how severe a tornado can be			2
it 's a way of coming back home and doing something for the people that had faith in me when i was younger			0
@entity65 is all about caring about your brothers and sisters , " @entity6 says			1
the first @entity65 took place in 2012 and @entity6 has vowed to make it an annual event because he feels the need will always be there			1
the storms will keep coming and the mission for him is not just to rebuild after loss , but to better prepare for the next storm			0
" i decided to make it an annual event , as long as i can ride to raise money for tornado victims			1
" he also is aware that in addition to the money raised , the event is a morale booster for the survivors in these small towns			0
" people will be struggling to rebuild for a long time			0
and just to see these people come out and stand beside the street and wave and smile after everything that they 've been through -- lost family members , lost their homes , their jobs -- and they still come out ( and ) thank you for what you 're doing			0
... it 's a period where everybody has decided to come together and work as one for one great cause , " @entity6 says			2
in addition to the bike ride , @entity6 and his group go into small @entity11 towns seeking to persuade landowners to donate land where community storm shelters can be built			1
" when you do n't have a place to get out of the way of a tornado , a lot of people get injured , lose their lives			0
hiding in a closet or getting in a bathtub does n't work when the whole house is getting picked up off the foundation and getting thrown down the street , " @entity6 says			2
and while the bike ride is @entity6 's major annual fundraiser , he stresses that the need continues year round and his group collects donations year round to continue their efforts			1
" i would rather do something to prevent the loss of life now than wait until something else bad happens , " @entity6 says			2
he also sees that severe weather like this affects many more americans beyond @entity11 and he recognizes the need to expand his reach			0
" i have already been contacted by friends of mine to come and do the same thing in @entity147			0
i 've been contacted by friends of mine in @entity150 ( @entity6 played baseball for the @entity152 ) that would love for me to come back there and do something there , and i want to			0
but i got ta take care of home first			0

@entity6 was very *disturbed* about tornadoes that hit @entity11 , his home state
the famed *athlete* started an annual bike ride across the state to raise money for victims
@entity65 funds will also go toward community shelters
