it had been almost a century since a @entity2 man made the semifinals of the @entity4 , but world no. 10 @entity5 dug deep to ensure that unfortunate milestone was not reached			1
the 24 - year - old reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time in his career after a grueling 3 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 4 victory over third seed @entity14			1
@entity5 has endured an energy - sapping run to the semis			2
before wednesday 's arduous battle with the @entity19 star , he beat @entity22 fifth seed @entity20 in a four - hour , 19 - minute marathon , which equaled the latest finish to a match at @entity26 , ending at 2:26 a.m. following his second four - hour - plus match , an exhausted @entity5 said , " my body was ok			1
i got more confidence , but i do n't know how i finished the game			0
" noted for his speed and footwork , the rising @entity2 star moved the @entity35 champion around the court , despite a stuttering start , and played brightly at the net to hold out for a historic victory			2
@entity5 breaks a long line of @entity2 men 's tennis disappointment , becoming the country 's first @entity4 semifinalist since @entity45 's in 1918 , when players were amateur and wore long pants			1
he 's @entity2 's first male grand slam semifinalist since @entity48 made it this far at @entity49 in 1933			1
@entity50 , beaten in the first round last week with her 44th birthday looming , was a women 's semifinalist in three grand slams in the mid- 1990s , but not the @entity4			1
next up is world no. 1 @entity56 on saturday			1
" hopefully i can play 100 % tennis next round , " @entity5 told reporters			2
@entity56 avenged his 2012 @entity4 final defeat by @entity62 as he triumphed 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 6 - 7 ( 1 - 7 ) 6 - 2 6 - 4 against the @entity64 eighth seed in wednesday 's late match			1
@entity5 's rise has been understated , still featured as " one to watch " on the @entity4 website , despite his high seeding in the tournament			1
@entity72 , head coach of the @entity73 in @entity74 , in @entity71 prefecture , trained the nascent star until his move to the @entity77			0
@entity72 said that @entity5 was obviously exceptionally talented			0
" i am very proud of him , " @entity72 told @entity78			0
" he came from the countryside to make this big in the world			0
he gives a dream , hope and courage to @entity2 's young players , professional players as well as coaches that ( they ) might be able to reach the top			2
" he first picked up a racket aged five and , at the age of 14 , moved to @entity92 to hone his considerable talent at the @entity94			0
he could n't speak @entity95 but , just like his wins so far in @entity97 , he gritted his teeth and set himself to the challenge			0
former @entity2 pro @entity100 , who " discovered " @entity101 at a tennis camp for young players in 2001 , hailed his victory as " amazing " considering he was n't in peak condition following his match against @entity20			0
@entity100 hailed @entity5 's mentality and likened the young player to his coach , former @entity4 finalist @entity109			1
@entity5 's result caused @entity100 to gush : " nothing better than having met @entity5 in my life			2
thank you , @entity5 , @entity114 ( s ) , and let 's go till the end , @entity5			2
" the @entity117 from 2008 had already made history by becoming the first @entity2 player to be ranked inside the @entity121 's top 10 , with a high - water mark of 9th in may of this year			0
@entity56 has lost in the past three @entity4 finals following his 2011 success , and was beaten in five out of six grand slam finals before winning @entity49 for the second time in july			1
" it 's great for @entity5 and @entity2 for him to be in the semifinal			1
he serves and moves very well , " the @entity129 said after beating @entity62 in three and a half hours			0
@entity131 meanwhile , women 's no. 1 @entity132 continued the defense of her title by reaching the semifinals with a 6 - 3 6 - 2 win over @entity139 11th seed @entity138			1
she came back from 3 - 0 down in the opening set to keep alive her bid to become the second woman in the @entity143 after @entity144 to win the tournament three years running			0
the @entity77 will next face @entity148 17th seed @entity146 , who defeated former world no. 1 @entity149 6 - 4 6 - 2 to earn a last - four spot for the first time at a grand slam			1
@entity146 's only win in four clashes with @entity132 was at the @entity155 , but the 32 - year - old -- seeking to join @entity144 and @entity157 on 18 grand slam titles -- is wary of her younger , left - handed opponent			1
she does n't care who she plays , she gives 100 %			0
those types of players are often difficult to play because it makes them better , " @entity132 said			0
" she also has that serve that can go out wide , or you never know where it 's going to go			0
she has a great backhand and she 's improved her forehand			0
" doubles delight date - @entity50 , meanwhile , earned a place in the semifinals of the women 's doubles on wednesday -- the first time she has done so in her long career			1
the @entity2 veteran , who reached a quarterfinal in 1992 , made the breakthrough in partnership with @entity183 @entity182 -- 15 years her junior -- as they beat eighth seeds @entity186 of the @entity183 and @entity188 of @entity189			2
they will next take on @entity146 and her fellow @entity148 @entity191 , the fourth seeds who knocked out the @entity132 sisters in their quarterfinal on tuesday			2
" i can not believe it myself , " date - @entity50 said			0
" recovery is difficult at my age , but i 'm enjoying every moment with @entity199			0
" the other semifinal will feature former world no. 1 @entity201 , who with @entity138 will be seeking the ninth women 's doubles title of her career -- but the first since 2002			1
they will take on third - seeded @entity207 of @entity208 and @entity209 of @entity210 .			0
