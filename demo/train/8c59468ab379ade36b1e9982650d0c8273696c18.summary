@entity0 -- on a hill overlooking the dusty , sprawling city of @entity0 is a park where kids fly their kites			2
a dirty , beaten up @entity9 sedan arrives , and @entity10 steps out wearing traditional @entity12 garb -- a perahan tunban ( tunic and pants ) and a lungee ( a headdress )			1
he 's traveled more than 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) from his home in @entity19 near the @entity21 border , a drive that has taken him at least five hours because the roads are so bad			2
he wants to tell his story after learning of the decision to transfer @entity28 prison from @entity29 to @entity12 control			1
it 's a story that began almost a decade ago , a year after the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the @entity29 by @entity38 terrorists then based in @entity12 under the protection of the @entity40 , radical islamic fundamentalists dislodged from power by the @entity29 - led war against terror that followed			1
" at the beginning of the @entity44 government we were at home , living our normal life , " he said			2
" i was a farmer supporting my wife and kids			2
the police surrounded our house in october 2002 and said ' you 're involved with the @entity40 , ' and they arrested me and took me to @entity28 prison			1
" @entity10 says many men in his town were rounded up that day			1
" they accused me of being involved with the @entity40 and attacking @entity56 airport about 40 kilometers from my home , but i asked them , ' how was i involved in an attack on the airport when you arrest me in my house , with my family ? ' " despite @entity10 's claim of innocence , @entity29 records reveal he was in possession of rocket motors and other equipment when he was taken into custody -- an allegation he strongly denies			1
he was taken to @entity72 , which was at the time was run by the @entity74 , and claims he was tortured there			1
" yes , yes , i was tortured , " he said			2
" they gave me electric shots on my wrists			0
i was hung from the ceiling for seven days			1
our faces were masked , and we were handcuffed , hanging from the ceiling			2
our legs were chained as well			0
" " as he explains his story he plays out the torture scenes , raising his arms into the air			0
" a guard would keep shaking the chain so we could n't sleep for seven days , " he said			2
" i completely lost my mind			0
i was hanging from the ceiling ; my body was aching			2
they would hit our heads into the wall			0
" asked about @entity10 's allegations of torture at @entity28 , a spokesman for the @entity74 in @entity102 released a statement that did not specifically reference his claims , but said in part : " @entity74 does not tolerate the abuse of detainees			1
all credible allegations of abuse are thoroughly investigated , and appropriate disciplinary action is taken when those allegations are substantiated			0
we take such matters very seriously			0
" although there have been substantiated cases of abuse in the past , for which @entity29 service members have been held accountable , our enemies also have employed a deliberate campaign of exaggerations and fabrications			1
the suggestion that @entity74 personnel , the overwhelming majority of whom serve honorably , are or ever were engaged in systematic mistreatment of detainees is false and does not withstand scrutiny			0
" as we sat cross-legged in the dirt in the park , @entity10 took in the panoramic view of @entity0 , a city surrounded by rugged mountains amid a landscape so arid and dry -- and yet so beautiful			1
as he gazed out , almost lost in thought , i asked him if he thought he would survive his time in @entity28			1
he said , " i felt completely hopeless			0
some people inside killed themselves			0
i too had lost all hope			0
i thought i was going to die in there			0
" it was during this period that two @entity12 prisoners , @entity142 and @entity143 who were also hung by their wrists , were beaten to death by @entity29 soldiers in @entity72 in december 2002			1
a @entity29 military investigation later found that abuse had been widespread that year and the following			1
after five months in @entity28 , @entity10 was transferred to @entity150 detention facility in @entity151 as a " medium - risk " prisoner			1
@entity150 was not like @entity28 , he said			1
" every prisoner had their own small room			0
we spent three months separately in confinement			0
after three months they took us up to camp 5			0
it was difficult to cope but not as bad as @entity28			1
" after four and a half years in @entity150 , @entity10 was finally released			1
" an @entity29 woman said , ' we 're sorry , ' " he said			1
" but what to do with their sorry ? i spent five years of my life there			0
you take me away from my family , my children			0
who supported them while i was locked up ? i lost five years of my life			0
" " @entity10 , who 's now 36 but looks at least a decade older , is still very upset about what hey says happened to him			1
he says he 's received no compensation and no formal apology			0
the father of five said , " it made me feel like i wanted to go out and kill all of them			0
if somebody takes you to the prison for five years , how would you feel ? i was very angry			2
" his level of anger has subsided over the years , but he believes the @entity29 and international forces need to get out of @entity12			1
" this will be a better place once they 've all gone			0
we do n't need them			0
@entity12 can run their own country , " he said .			2
