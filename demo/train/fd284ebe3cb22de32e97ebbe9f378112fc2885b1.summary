-- @entity14 ' triumph over the @entity15 in @entity16 at the 1936 @entity17 , @entity10 's perfect volley in the 2002 @entity12 final , @entity2 ' astonishing chip - in at the masters in 2005 or @entity4 celebrating in the growing dusk around @entity7 's @entity6 after overcoming @entity8 in 2008			1
all iconic moments in the history of sport , forever etched in the memory of spectators lucky enough to be able to say " i was there "			2
but these days witnessing greatness is clearly not quite enough for the modern sports fan as countless spectators religiously record career - defining events on mobile devices and post their own personal accounts on various social media websites			1
shades of greatness : @entity35 dreams of @entity37 renaissance " the pleasure of sport lies not so much in witnessing an event as talking about it , " explains @entity38 , professor of @entity39 at @entity41 's @entity40			1
" we 've all at some point sat at home and watched a fight or a tennis match in isolation and it 's never as enjoyable as when we are in company , talking about the competition as it unfolds			2
mobile phones have opened out the possibilities			1
we can talk to anyone , anywhere while the action is taking place			0
" one event to have resisted the tidal wave of mobile technology which has swept through society is the @entity37 -- golf 's oldest major -- which will take place for the 141st time this weekend			1
blog : why @entity70 golf has a healthy future but this year the @entity72 , which governs golf outside the @entity70 and @entity73 , has relented , allowing spectators at north - west @entity41 's @entity75 and @entity76 to bring their phones into the event for the first time since 2006			1
" the attachment people have to their mobile phones is getting ever stronger , " @entity82 told @entity0			1
" people feel it 's an item they really do n't want to be separated from			0
it 's very clear to us that people coming to any sporting event , and the @entity37 is no exception , want to have their mobile phones with them			1
" this is a view supported by @entity38 as he outlines how people are increasingly unwilling to venture out of the house without a mobile phone in their pocket			1
" mobiles are now less accessories , more extensions of our lives , " said @entity38 , who is currently conducting a study entitled " @entity102 ? " " we can manage without our watches or our keys , but not our phones			1
they are like pacemakers -- artificial devices , but vital for the regulation of organs			1
" more generally we are consuming sports differently today than we were as recently as five years ago			0
the pattern is towards a much more remote consumption through smartphones and mobile computers			1
" portability is the key to this			0
we consume not just sport but everything on the move			2
" current world no. 3 @entity125 , searching for a first major title in front of his home fans , sees no reason why the public should be separated from their trusty mobile phones , providing the players are not distracted at crucial moments			1
@entity133 @entity132 , also looking for a first win in one of golf 's four marquee events , agrees with @entity125 , though as long as the sport 's fans observe the customary on - course etiquette			1
the @entity72 have set up designated " @entity145 " where visitors can use their phones , while also attempting to ensure spectators do not take home their every own visual souvenirs			2
" there are obviously great challenges with that , " outlined @entity82			0
" that provision is in keeping with many sporting events , including the @entity17 where they are going to have exactly the same challenge			0
" we have a very strict mobile phone policy at the @entity37 this year which means there are dedicated areas where people can use their phones			1
" the hope is they will not use phones to any great extent near play and we 'll have a marshal near play encouraging that behavior			2
it is one of the great challenges of allowing mobile phones at any sporting event			1
" @entity38 argues such personal recordings of events are used by people to enhance their eye - witness memories			0
" we remember experiences by context : the circumstances that form the setting for an event , what happened immediately before and afterwards , and the people with whom we stood , sat and chatted to , " said @entity38			0
" phones enable us to extend this to a wider network of people			2
by describing an experience we memorialize it			0
" one man who believes sport 's iconic moments do not require additional " memorializing " is @entity193 journalist @entity192 , the author of @entity194 : football 's dreamer , schemers playmakers and playboys			2
ten years ago @entity192 was at @entity199 , @entity200 when @entity10 's audacious left - foot strike in the last minute of the first half proved enough to give @entity203 a 2 - 1 win over @entity206 's @entity205 in one of soccer 's most high - profile matches -- the @entity12 final			2
@entity192 believes he witnessed a sporting moment of such complete perfection he decided to never watch a replay of the now iconic goal			2
" maybe people growing up now , in the age of technology and media saturation , will develop a different attitude , " wrote @entity192 in a chapter extolling the talents of @entity10			0
" but one of the pleasures of being a football fan is the archive of individual images saved on the memory 's hard drive			0
" each of them is divorced from its immediate context : only with the greatest difficulty could i dredge up the details of the matches in question , never mind its result			0
" i wanted @entity10 's goal to claim a place in that personal file ... if i watched it again on television , i would inevitably be replacing my own image of the moment with that of a television camera , if only partially			0
" it would not contain within it the surge of exhilaration and admiration that i felt in that moment and that remain part of the emotional response to replaying the goal as it was experienced from my own point of view			0
" despite the compelling and heartfelt argument put forward by @entity192 , @entity82 is confident the @entity37 will retain the aura which has helped it become one of golf 's most cherished tournaments			1
" you ca n't swim against the tide in terms of technology and we 're not the only sporting event having to deal with this challenge , " said @entity82			0
" we 've got great television partners and they are always going to find a way to romanticize those phenomenal sporting moments			0
equally , people will want to take their own records of sporting events			0
" there would be no point trying to fight that , it is the way people want to consume events now			0
but traditional media will always allow you to present events in the way they should be			0
" so with the influence of the phone continuing to grow , how long before spectators are so busy tweeting about the @entity37 they miss the champion lifting the @entity290 ?			1

the @entity37 will allow mobile phones for the first time since 2006
@entity295 believes mobiles have become like pacemakers -- artificial devices , but vital for the regulation of organs
top golfers @entity125 and @entity132 have backed the move
use of phones will be *restricted* certain *zones* , while they must be *switched* to *silent*
