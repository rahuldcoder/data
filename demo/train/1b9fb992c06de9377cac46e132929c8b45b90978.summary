@entity0 -- the fact that @entity3 rolled to a second term in @entity5 and @entity6 won in @entity7 was n't a surprise			1
public opinion polls have consistently shown both men in the lead			0
but the exit polls showed two very different paths to victory			0
@entity3 steamrolled hapless @entity16 nominee @entity15 , 60 % to 39 % with 80 % of the vote counted , crushing her in almost every key demographic			1
it was the biggest victory for a @entity21 gubernatorial candidate in @entity5 since @entity22 was running in the 1980s			0
what @entity3 's victory means for 2016 @entity6 's victory was much narrower than most of the polls indicated , 48 % to 46 % with 98 % of the vote in			1
he did n't win every key group -- self - described independents broke for @entity31 nominee @entity30 -- but he successfully stoked fears about @entity30 's strident brand of conservatism in an increasingly moderate battleground state			1
let 's start with @entity5			0
@entity3 beat his female opponent among women by 16 points			1
he won self - described moderates by more than 20 points			0
he won independents by more than 30 points			0
he won voters making less than $ 50,000			0
he won voters making more than $ 100,000			0
check the exit poll : @entity5 governor 's race @entity3 did very well for a @entity31 with core @entity16 constituencies			1
he won 49 % of voters between the ages of 18 and 29			0
he won roughly three in 10 self - described liberals			0
he won 50 % of the @entity55 vote			0
and he won roughly 20 % of the @entity58 - @entity57 vote			0
these are all critical selling points for @entity31 hungry to take back the @entity60 in 2016			2
if there 's one warning sign for @entity3 's 2016 hopes , it 's the fact that the exit polls show he would lose his home state to @entity68 by four points			1
that does n't fit with the narrative that he 's a @entity31 capable of winning in blue @entity57			1
half of @entity5 voters said @entity3 would make a good president			2
but that does n't mean 50 % of @entity5 voters would necessarily back him if he runs for the @entity60			0
@entity3 will have to walk a fine line over the next couple of years , bolstering his standing among national @entity21 primary voters while maintaining his credibility with more independent and @entity16 - leaning voters			1
former @entity86 gov. @entity85 could n't do it			0
as for @entity7 , @entity6 won by getting his base to the polls			1
@entity16 were the biggest partisan voting bloc in the state , comprising 37 % of the total electorate and backing the former @entity94 chairman by a 93 - point margin			2
@entity6 hit @entity30 hard during the campaign on hot button social issues like abortion , and the strategy paid off			1
@entity30 actually won among the 72 % of voters who cared most about the economy or health care			1
but among the 20 % of voters who called abortion the most important issue , @entity6 won by 25 points , 59 % -34 %			2
check the exit poll : @entity7			2
governor 's race half of @entity7 voters called @entity30 's issue positions too conservative			1
only 41 % called @entity6 's positions too liberal			2
in the end , @entity30 was hurt by the same tea party alliance that won him the nomination at the @entity21 convention earlier this year			1
only 28 % of @entity7 voters said they support the tea party movement			1
forty - two percent said they oppose it , and they broke for @entity6 by more than 70 points			0
and no , @entity30 ca n't blame his loss on scandal - plagued outgoing @entity21 gov. @entity126 or third - party libertarian candidate @entity128			2
despite his scandals , @entity7 voters said they approve of @entity126 's job performance by 11 points , 52 % to 41 %			2
and if @entity128 had not been in the race , exit polls indicate @entity6 still would have beaten @entity30 by two points , 48 % to 46 %			1
