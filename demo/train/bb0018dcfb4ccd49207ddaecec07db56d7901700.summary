-- i 'm proud to be @entity2			1
born in @entity3 and raised in a bilingual home , pierogies , borscht and pysanky ( @entity2 easter eggs ) were all staples in my life			1
so was @entity2 school -- where i was taught history , culture , literature and grammar every saturday morning for 13 years -- and @entity2 scouts and @entity2 dancing			1
it is nearly impossible to separate me from the culture			0
and i would never want that			0
that 's what makes it so hard to see the images of escalating violence on tv among the @entity2 people -- with whom i feel such a connection			1
to many of them , the protests are fueled by memories of @entity35 control and fears that @entity37 will use its economic pressure to pull @entity2 back into its orbit			1
the oppression of the @entity35 system is why my father fled the country 75 years ago , when he was only 18			1
he loved @entity2 but escaped @entity35 rule to build a new life in @entity3			1
transplanting that @entity2 identity into @entity47 , @entity48 , was not always easy			1
and growing up in the @entity49 , when i would tell someone i was @entity2 , i was often met with a confused look			1
that was generally followed by , " so you speak @entity37 ? " i ca n't blame them for making that assumption			1
after all , @entity2 was the second biggest country in the @entity35			1
but there was no particular pride in that : hatred of the @entity35 runs deep among many @entity2			1
for my father , the flight from @entity2 -- with his two brothers , sister , father and mother -- was dangerous and difficult			1
he made his way to @entity3 via @entity67 during @entity68 he survived the bombing of @entity70 , and his family got separated			2
they eventually found each other once they all landed safely in the @entity3 , but for a frightened interval , they had no idea whether the others were alive or dead			0
my sister , brother and i grew up riveted by my father 's and uncle 's stories about dodging the authorities to escape			2
my father told of avoiding soldiers as he walked among the dead after the bombing in @entity70 ; they had shoot - to - kill orders for anyone who might be looting			0
it was like listening to a live thriller or spy novel			0
my father may not have spoken @entity91 when he arrived in @entity3 , but he was determined			0
he mastered the language and went on to become a chief financial officer of @entity94 in @entity95			0
he dreamed of the day @entity2 would become independent , as did my mother -- a @entity2 born in @entity3			1
both died before they could see it			0
and in 1992 , i traveled to the country on a teach @entity91 program sponsored by a @entity2 organization			1
it was a time when @entity2 was like the @entity104			1
the country had just elected a new president and was newly independent -- but many did n't really know what that meant			0
when i arrived in @entity109 , i assumed everyone would speak @entity2 and that i would fit right in			1
i was mistaken , as many spoke @entity37			2
more alarming to me was when i realized i did n't know who to ask for help in finding a telephone			0
in @entity3 , it was easy			0
you just ask a cop			0
in @entity2 , there were many different uniforms -- not so easy			2
( @entity120 : ask the old lady , or babushka -- works every time			0
) one thing was crystal clear : there was a thirst for the @entity104			0
after years of oppression , my students wanted to learn everything they could from me about @entity3			2
one young girl even said her dream was to go to @entity132 ( whose is n't ? ) as a " homeland journey , " for me it was at times a surreal experience			2
i was suddenly seeing all the things i had only learned about in books			0
( swimming in the @entity137 was not something you just dreamed about in @entity2 school ! ) even more precious was when my sister and i traveled to @entity142 , the city of my family			1
my sister and i saw the school where our grandfather taught and the pond where our father and his siblings went skating			0
that my father and his family could leave such a place -- leave behind everything they knew -- and make a courageous leap of faith into a new country where they could not even speak the language filled me with admiration			2
i have never felt more grateful to them for making that trek as when i met some local @entity2 who said they wished their families had done what mine did			2
that 's when it really hit me that i could leave that country , but their lives were going to be much more difficult			0
as i watch the violent and deadly protests from afar , i think now about all these people			0
i see in the @entity2 locked in confrontation the same national pride with which i was raised			1
they no longer want to leave			0
they want to have a strong independent nation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity179 is a proud @entity181 , raised in *traditions* of parents ' homeland
@entity186 fled @entity35 oppression with family , settled in @entity49 , *instilled* in her @entity2 pride
it 's hard for her to see violence in @entity109 , where protesters fear growing @entity37 influence
@entity179 , who visited @entity2 after independence , says nation today just wants to be free
