his family admitted him to a mental hospital in february 2010 , according to both sources			0
that would have disqualified him from buying a firearm or even being in the presence of guns , authorities say			0
but in december 2010 , @entity15 was able to purchase a .40 - caliber handgun at a licensed gun dealer in neighboring @entity32 , according to the same source , despite a required , computerized background check			1

in @entity15 's case , it did n't happen as soon as it should have , the sources say			1
@entity51 prosecuting attorney @entity50 wo n't confirm or deny that @entity15 's mental health record was the specific information that was missing from the federal database			1
however , @entity15 's mother previously told @entity0 he was involuntarily committed by his family a few years ago			2
@entity56 said there was an ' inexcusable delay ' in relaying information from the state to the federal background check database			1
@entity56 stressed that the firearm dealer who sold the handgun to @entity15 did " what was legally required " under the law and performed a background check			1
@entity15 tried to buy another firearm in early 2011 , but that attempt failed when the same computerized system flagged him as ineligible , @entity56 said			1
it 's unclear where @entity15 tried to purchase the second firearm			1
it 's also unknown how many guns were seized from @entity15 's home where he lived with his parents and how many belonged to @entity15			2
@entity51 , @entity7 meet your new sheriff @entity15 's mother , @entity80 , told @entity0 last week that her daughter signed paperwork to admit @entity15 to a hospital and that he was there for about a week in 2010			1
she says her son " went crazy " in their yard			0
the family called police , and he was taken to a hospital			0
he also has been a patient at a local mental health clinic , she says			0
@entity92 , @entity93 attorney for the @entity94 , said the @entity95 is continuing its investigation of @entity15 's gun history			1
@entity92 has not yet decided whether to prosecute @entity15 on felony federal weapons charges and declined to comment further			2
lying on a gun purchase application is a misdemeanor in @entity7 , however , it is a felony under federal law , according to authorities			1
@entity15 is accused of killing @entity18 on april 3 as he sat in his truck just blocks from the county courthouse			1
the suspect parked his car close to the sheriff 's @entity108 and shot through the window twice , hitting the sheriff twice in the head , according to a state official who was briefed on the investigation			2
after a brief chase , @entity15 was shot and wounded by a sheriff 's deputy in @entity117 , @entity7 , after he wrecked the vehicle he was driving and raised his weapon			1
@entity56 said the shooter used a @entity122 .40 - caliber handgun to kill the sheriff			0
investigators do n't know what the motive is			0
@entity15 is alleged to have made a statement shortly after he was shot , but authorities wo n't reveal what he said , saying only that it " could have been interpreted in different ways			1
" williamson police chief @entity131 says authorities later spoke to @entity15 at his bedside last week , but the suspect was too medicated to make a lucid statement			2
on wednesday , a judge appointed @entity138 attorney @entity137 to represent @entity15 , who remains hospitalized as a precautionary measure to help protect his rights , according to @entity56			2
the prosecutor said he expects to bring evidence before a grand jury within the next couple of weeks			0
investigators have been collecting several pieces of surveillance video evidence and receipts that put @entity15 in the area of the courthouse , some within an hour of the fatal shooting , @entity56 said			2
police are still seeking surveillance cameras that might have captured the murder itself , @entity56 added			0
a witness told police the alleged shooter was wearing a hood when he fired into the sheriff 's vehicle , then fled the scene , according to @entity56			0
@entity18 's daughter said " it 's a strong possibility " that her father was killed for vigorously pursuing the illicit drug trade			2
@entity18 had taken office only three months before his killing but already had built a reputation for taking out dealers and shutting down " pill mills			2
" " my dad fought tirelessly against drug abuse			0
he just wanted to clean up the county and make it a better place to live , " @entity175 told @entity0			0
" things are still under investigation at this time			0
we really are unsure , " @entity175 said			0
@entity18 's funeral was sunday			0
his wife , @entity183 , was appointed last week to complete his term , which runs through the end of next year			0
mandated by the @entity186 of 1993 and launched by the @entity187 in 1998 , the @entity45 is used by federal firearms licensees to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives			0
the reliability of the @entity45 system has been a point of contention in the debate on gun violence			0
a deal reached by sens. @entity199 , @entity200 , and @entity201 , @entity202 , aims to tackle issues some have with the current background check reporting methods			1
the @entity199 - @entity201 compromise would require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the " violently mentally ill " to the national background check system , addressing a criticism by the @entity212 and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information			1
