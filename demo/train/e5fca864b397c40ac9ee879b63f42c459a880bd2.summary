@entity0 hosts " @entity1 " from 5 to 7 p.m. et mondays through fridays on @entity2			1
" @entity1 " uses the day 's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives , spirited debate and your points of view			0
@entity0 says coaches need to be smart and know when to alter practices because of hot weather			1
@entity13 , @entity14 ( @entity15 ) -- we love our football in this country , do n't we ? whether it 's watching the pee - wees or the pros , there 's nothing like taking in a game on a crisp fall afternoon			1
you see your breath as you stand and cheer the pop of the pads or the last - minute touchdown			2
i love this game so much , i cried when i knew i was n't big enough or fast enough to play anymore			2
many of us share that same passion			0
and we should share in the grief when a 15 - year - old boy dies because of a football practice			1
we have to learn from the death of @entity41 so something like this never happens again -- because it could happen to any of our kids			1
it was a hot , humid day in august 2008 in @entity45 , @entity46			0
@entity41 and his @entity48 teammates were wrapping up the second of two practices that day			1
they finished with a grueling round of " gassers , " or sprints			0
@entity41 's body was breaking down , and he did n't even know it			1
his body temperature had reached 107 degrees			0
he died three days later			1
so who is to blame for this needless tragedy ? was the coach irresponsible in pushing his players so hard on such a hot day ? prosecutors thought that was the case			2
so for the first time , a football coach faced criminal charges and had to go to trial for the death of one of his players			1
@entity72 was charged with reckless homicide and wanton endangerment			0
the state accused the coach of denying players water and even forcing them to run extra sprints as punishment on that hot august day			2
the coach 's defense presented witnesses who said @entity41 complained of not feeling well before practice even began and others who said the fact that he was on @entity88 contributed to his high body temperature			1
in the end , a jury acquitted @entity72 of any charges related to @entity41 's death			1
from the moment i heard about this case , i never thought @entity72 would be convicted			0
the charges were too harsh , and no jury would believe that he knowingly and maliciously put a player in a position that would lead to his death			0
but i think it is a good thing that this trial took place , and i hope coaches across the country now think twice about how they run their practices and whether they are putting our kids in danger			1
sadly , @entity41 is not the first such tragic case			1
according to the @entity113 , 39 football players have died from heat stroke since 1995 ; 29 of them were playing for high school teams ( the others were college and professional players and one sandlot incident )			1
the first thing we need to do to reduce the risk of any more heat - related deaths is to make sure a doctor gives our kids a full physical examination before they take the field			1
that means we go beyond listening to the high school freshman 's heart and making him turn and cough			0
one doctor on my show , " @entity1 , " said we should give them an @entity132 , and i agree			0
an electrocardiogram is n't expensive , and having one before a high school player 's first season would help doctors diagnose pre-existing conditions			2
second , every coach should monitor how hot it is before and during practice			0
a heat index monitor costs less than $ 150 , and that is a small price to pay for safety			0
let 's look at what @entity72 was dealing with in @entity46			0
the @entity149 guidelines say that if the heat index is above 95 , practice is altered			1
the heat index the day of @entity41 's death was one degree away , at 94			1
two questions off that : should the temperature be lowered to 92 or 90 ? and what happens when we alter practice ? it should mean that helmets and shoulder pads come off , unless players are tackling			1
regardless of the answers , put the rules in place so all coaches know and are on the same playing field			0
another thing to consider is how many times a team should practice during the scorching hot dog days of august			2
there is usually a " hell " week in there , when a team practices two times per day			0
i have no problem with that as long as a coach is smart about how hot it is out there			0
six years ago , the @entity184 forced college football teams to cut back two - a - day practices , especially at the start of the season , so players could become acclimatized to hot and humid weather			1
going along with that , the @entity191 advocates starting off with one - a - day practices and then two - a - days with a one - a - day in between			2
the last thing , and this could be the most important , is to never deny a player water			0
according to the @entity196 , one of the best ways to prevent a heat - related illness is through proper hydration			2
so if a player is asking for a drink , give it to him			0
the goal in all this is not to restrict coaches or how we practice football but to make sure we never have another story like @entity41 's			1
the sadness of seeing his mom sobbing in a courtroom as she had to relive her son 's death was just heartbreaking			0
we do n't want another coach on trial			0
@entity72 has said @entity41 's death is a burden he will live with for the rest of his life , and i hope his story , and @entity41 's tragic death , bring about needed changes to the game we love			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			2

thirty - nine football players have died from heat stroke since 1995
15 - year - old @entity41 collapsed during football practice and died three days later
@entity0 : the goal is n't to restrict coaches but to keep kids safe
