@entity0 , @entity1 -- til death do us part			0
on my wedding day , i will not be saying that sentence			0
not that i 'm not in it to win it -- i am -- only that if two people are told they can never leave , how do they know the other really wants to stay ? marriage is hard enough without the specter of death being the only way out hanging over our heads			1
to me , it 's just another fire and brimstone tactic absentmindedly handed down from generation to generation just to get people to stay in line			1
or give them comfort that once they kiss , they will always be there for each other			0
but it 's a lot harder than that and sometimes things do n't work out			1
recognizing that does n't threaten the relationship , it just means you 're paying attention			2
and in a country with a healthy divorce rate and prenuptial agreements -- which are essentially @entity45 before the ink on @entity47 is even dry -- i think it 's safe to assume there are a lot of examples of things not working out to pay attention to			2
this is one of the areas where the evangelical church needs to grow most -- learning how to minister to a society that can no longer be scared straight			2
the fearmongering has been undermined by hypocrisy , and the younger generations now find themselves in the enviable position of marrying and staying married because they want to , not because they 're afraid not to			0
a recent @entity65 study found that the number of @entity68 18 and older who are married dropped from 72 % in 1960 to 57 % in 2000 to 51 % today			1
combine that with the declining divorce rate , people getting married later in life and with seven in 10 millennials saying it 's ok to have premarital sex ( according to @entity75 ) , and what you have is a generation that is totally over having their sex lives managed by people they 're not having sex with			1
now some religious conservatives would deem this perfect storm humanism and proclaim that the very fabric of society is fraying			1
they need to say these things because , well , this new - found empowerment threatens a business model that is based on fear			2
but church attendance has not been declining since the 1970s because people are shacking up			0
it 's because the church as a whole has become stagnant while the society it 's based in continues to evolve			1
couple that with the disconnect between how we 're told to live our lives and the lives being led by those doing the telling , and you can see why we 're just less religious as a country			0
at some point , church leaders are going to have to figure out how to minister to a congregation that is not waiting to have sex and not afraid to say it			0
not ashamed to say it			0
that 's going to be hard to do but necessary if it wants to stay relevant			0
it 's not as if people are falling in love less , not if the 13 % jump in one year in the number of unmarried couples living together is any indication			1
so what is the church planning to do when the threat of hell no longer works ? when people exchange " til death do us part " with " you wan na move in ? " , it may feel less pious , less certain and less concrete , but it 's ultimately more tangible because it is based in the here and now , not in a future which may or may not arrive			1
no one , with maybe the exception of @entity135 , enters a marriage with the intent of getting a divorce			0
but there are now people entering relationships with no intentions of getting married and their relationship is not less valid , their love is not less real , their future is not less certain			1
the church has to figure out a way to talk about relationships and marriage the way it is framed today , without all of the threats			2
or risk being left behind			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 : religious views of marriage as a lifetime *commitment* are outmoded
most young @entity68 say premarital sex is morally *acceptable*
he says long - term relationships are great but should n't be *enforced* by society 's pressure
@entity153 : people who have no plans to marry can still have real and loving relationships
