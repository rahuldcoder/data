-- ok , so you probably own a smartphone			2
if you 're a student or someone who travels a lot for work , you almost certainly have a laptop			2
you may also have a tablet computer , which is great for consulting recipes in the kitchen or watching reruns of " @entity11 " in bed			0
now you 're expected to buy a miniature tablet , too ? since @entity16 introduced its @entity17 on tuesday , some commenters on @entity0 , @entity15 and elsewhere have expressed skepticism about the need for the new device			1
the @entity17 is slightly larger than rival tablets from @entity22 and @entity23 and about two - thirds the size of the current @entity25			1
prices start at $ 329 , or $ 70 less than a full - size ipad 2 but $ 130 more than a comparable @entity28			2
analysts agree @entity16 will probably sell millions of them			0
but @entity16 's stock took a dive when the @entity17 's price was announced , and a search of the blogosphere found less excitement among consumers than what greeted the original @entity25 or the last several iphones			1
" @entity16 sells the same item every year just in different sizes ... " said @entity0 commenter named @entity40			0
said @entity43 on @entity15 , " there 's a woman next to me watching video on her @entity47			0
it is the size of a small brick			2
in other news , @entity16 announced the @entity17 today			1
" @entity0 commenter @entity56 wrote , " they 've got so many different sizes of iphones and @entity25 , why do n't they just custom - make every device to the dimensions i ask for when i buy it ? " consumers could get whiplash from the way phones and tablets have grown and shrunk in size in recent years			1
fueled by interest in watching video and playing games , smartphone screens have been gradually getting larger -- from about 3.5 inches , measured diagonally , to almost 5 inches			0
meanwhile , tablets have been getting smaller			2
the original @entity25 and its first wave of rivals measured about 10 inches across , but more recent entries such as @entity22 's @entity28 and @entity23 's @entity74 have been 7 inches -- small enough to slip into a coat pocket			0
the @entity17 measures 7.9 inches diagonally and is 5.3 inches wide -- pocketable , at least according to this blog			1
blogger @entity77 , tongue planted in cheek , declared the @entity17 's trade - paperback size will make it a more highbrow option for e-book lovers than the smaller @entity28 , which more resembles a mass - market paperback			1
" wide rectangles are classier than narrow rectangles , " he wrote			0
" my conclusion : the @entity17 will be for literary snobs , and the @entity28 will be for dumb - dumbs who read airport garbage books			1
@entity28 owners will read @entity92 , and @entity17 owners will read @entity94			1
you heard it here first			0
" as phones and tablets merge , manufacturers must find that sweet spot between a device that 's easily portable and one with a screen big enough not to cause eyestrain after an hour or two			1
" it will clearly come down to personal preference , " said @entity104 , a principal analyst at @entity105			0
" the dividing line has historically been what would fit in a pocket			0
also , the traditional ergonomics of holding something next to your face , or holding something in one hand			0
" the @entity17 weighs less than half as much as a full - size @entity25			1
in describing it on tuesday , @entity16 marketing chief @entity117 said it was about the size and weight of a pad of paper			2
" @entity123 and @entity22 have known this for a while -- that this size product strikes a great balance of mobility and capability for on - the - go usage , as well as ' single hand use , ' which is critical to reading and viewing			2
this has always been a drawback to the larger @entity25			0
you simply ca n't hold it for a long period of time , " said @entity135 , an industrial designer whose firm helped develop @entity123 's @entity138 e-reader			2
" as for whether @entity17 is an addition or a replacement for @entity25 owners , it 's probably both , " added @entity135 , who has also worked at @entity16			1
" some crazy people will want both , and some will find its size more compelling for everyday use			1
studies have shown that most @entity25 stay in the home , around the coffee table , but the @entity17 will be a much more mobile device			1
" but there 's the question of how many gadgets people actually need			0
will consumers shell out $ 329 and up ( to $ 659 , depending on storage and connectivity ) for a device that 's not that much bigger than the smartphone they already own ? many online commenters say they do n't see the point			1
" i could get the @entity17 , or i could literally just keep using my @entity164 and see no difference , " said @entity163 on @entity15			1
" the @entity25 ( revolutionary when it was released ) deserves every bit of praise and success it has garnered thus far			0
but today , @entity16 did n't debut an innovative product , " wrote @entity170 on @entity171			2
" today they debuted a clone			0
" then again , people in 2010 expressed doubts about the original @entity25 , calling it little more than a bigger @entity177			0
@entity16 ceo @entity178 announced tuesday that the company has sold more than 100 million of them .			0

some *web* commenters say they do n't see the point of the new @entity17
consumers could get whiplash from how phones , tablets have grown and shrunk in size
as phones and tablets seem to merge , manufacturers must find that sweet spot in between
