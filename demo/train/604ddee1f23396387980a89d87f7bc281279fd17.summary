@entity0 is so politically active , she gave 2012 presidential candidate @entity1 a questionnaire to answer on policy positions			2
when he failed to respond , she volunteered on president @entity5 's campaign			1
she also encourages her neighbors to vote			2
her activism is persistent despite feeling like she is an ignored component of the @entity10 electorate			0
" i feel like they 're not talking to me , " @entity11 said of politicians			1
that 's because she is poor			0
her life is not unlike those of millions of @entity10 who rely on a patchwork of government assistance and near - minimum wage jobs			1
the mother of a 9 - year - old and 6 - year - old twins , who was once homeless , finds herself unemployed again because her temporary job at a day care ended on december 2			1
her husband makes $ 8.50 per hour working behind the food counter at a deli ; they struggle to feed their family even with $ 160 per month in food stamp benefits			0
opinion : out of jobs , out of benefits , out of luck even though she feels disconnected from the political process , @entity11 is politically motivated			0
if politicians understood what life is like for her and her neighbors , she said , things could get better			1
" it 's hurtful because they do n't know what we go through every month , " she said of politicians			1
nearly 50 million live in poverty in the @entity10 -- about one out of every six people -- matching or beating some of the highest poverty rates since the 1960s			1
but it is one of the least discussed topics in national politics			0
correspondent 's notebook : hungry during the holidays an @entity5 pledge well into his second term , president @entity5 has turned his attention to poverty and income inequality			1
it 's an issue he 's rarely addressed up to this point			0
in key unemployment benefits vote , @entity67 one vote short in his first presidential campaign , poverty was not a focus , but @entity5 pledged to end childhood hunger by 2015			1
he 's far from achieving that			0
the year @entity5 made the pledge , a record 31.8 million people received supplemental food benefits			1
that record has been broken each year since , with more than 47 million people now in the food stamp program			0
while he has launched a campaign to address income inequality by urging @entity85 to raise the federal minimum wage and extend expired unemployment benefits , activists said @entity5 has done little that is substantive			1
but the issue was around long before @entity5 took office in 2008			1
fifty years after president @entity92 launched the @entity93 , which was a central component of his 1964 campaign , poverty still affects millions of @entity10			1
and the gap between the wealthy and the poor has grown steadily			0
the top 5 % of households possessed 22.3 % of income in 2012 , compared with 16.3 % in 1968 , according to the @entity100			1
moreover , a 2011 report by the @entity102 found that the top 1 % of households have seen after - tax income grow by 275 % since 1979 , compared with 18 % for the bottom 20 %			1
those at the low end did not keep up with inflation			1
the nonpartisan congressional analysts blamed unequal wage distribution and " less redistributive " government benefits and taxes for increased income inequality			1
@entity5 : wage , income gap eroding @entity10 dream just as problematic to hunger and poverty activists -- and to people like @entity11 -- there is almost no real discussion of issues important to them in @entity123 , except when they surface in periodic budget wrangling			1
dr. @entity126 , an associate professor at @entity128 's @entity127 and founder of the witnesses to @entity131 focusing on " mothers who know poverty first hand , " said the lack of discussion is detrimental to the poor because winning candidates ca n't be held accountable for promises they never make			1
" we 've seen a complete falling away of people in positions of leadership , " she said			0
but that could change : dealing with poverty appears to be trending like @entity146			1
progressive candidates liberals hope 2016 will be different as they push people like @entity151 sen. @entity150 to run for president			1
a neophyte politician , @entity153 is a champion of liberal economic policies			0
and progressives believe the election of @entity159 @entity158 as mayor of @entity161 , the world 's financial capital , is a promising sign the nation may be more ready to discuss issues pertaining to poor people			1
a populist , @entity158 has stressed a tale of " two cities " theme that illustrated a division of rich and poor			0
@entity173 sworn in by @entity174 " the increasing interest on giving everyone in society a fair shake ... could foreshadow the fact that we may be on the cusp of entering a new progressive era , " said @entity175 , a @entity67 strategist who worked for former president @entity174 and presidential candidate @entity176			1
conservatives , too but the push on poverty and income inequality might come from an unexpected corner of @entity10 politics : the conservative wing of the @entity192			1
rep. @entity193 of @entity194 , a possible 2016 contender , is to address poverty thursday at an event with @entity199 ' @entity198 , which could be the advent of a public campaign on the issue			1
for the past year , he has quietly been exploring the theme			0
he embarked on a listening and learning tour of poor communities across the @entity10 , according to several people who have either accompanied him or discussed it with him			0
@entity209 , president of the @entity211 conservative think tank , said @entity193 " represents a movement and a recognition that in the past five years , people in the bottom half have gone backwards			1
" @entity216 said he has spoken with @entity193 , the 2012 @entity192 vice presidential nominee , about poverty and the issue is something that he wants to tackle			2
it started less than a month before @entity1 and @entity193 lost the election			0
while the standard bearer was largely seen as an aloof elitist , @entity193 met with a group of low - income people at @entity226			1
@entity227 , an acquaintance of @entity193 who runs the @entity228 , a national organization that works with low - income people , said the lawmaker reached out to him after the election , saying he wanted to learn more			1
@entity193 meets with him one day a month in a different city and spends time with poor people , @entity227 said			0
" it 's been an eye - opener " for @entity193 , @entity227 said			2
" i 've taken him to places that few other representatives have been			0
" @entity227 thinks @entity193 will eventually form a poverty agenda , " but before he does so , he needs to understand what the needs are			2
" while @entity193 is exploring the issue quietly , two other potential 2016 candidates are also highlighting the issue			0
sen. @entity243 of @entity244 delivered a speech on poverty in @entity247 in recent weeks			2
evidence that he might be looking to elevate the issue politically is that he chose the @entity247 , which is bankrupt despite a resurgence in auto manufacturing			0
@entity252 is also a traditional presidential battleground			0
@entity243 : extending jobless benefits a ' disservice ' and @entity257 sen. @entity256 is unveiling his anti-poverty agenda this week			0
the right 's focus on the poor is a strict about - face			2
the @entity192 is considered unsympathetic to the poor			0
current efforts in @entity85 to sharply cut food stamps and statewide efforts to drug - test welfare recipients exacerbate the perception			2
if politicians make poverty a central -- or at least one -- component of national campaigns , it would be a significant departure from modern - day politicking			1
recent politics @entity276 and @entity277 often receive widespread attention on the campaign trail because the issues have political advantages			2
while both are credited for lifting and keeping seniors out of poverty , the programs are available to all seniors			2
welfare , unemployment benefits and food stamps -- government programs intended to benefit those most in need -- are spread throughout the population and traditionally do n't get as much political exposure			0
while an expansion of government programs could be risky rhetoric in some political circles -- especially @entity192 ones -- innovative approaches to address the often - talked about gap between rich and poor and the shrinking middle class have been absent			2
the only major party candidate recently to make poverty a central theme was democrat @entity308 , who did so at a time when the economy was perceived to be strong			2
the former senator fell short in the 2008 presidential primaries against @entity5 , who spoke in generic broad sweeps about a more just and prosperous citizenship that could simultaneously be appealing to the wealthiest and poorest			1
instead , poverty becomes an issue only when a candidate 's dismissal of the poor becomes public			2
@entity321 : the most unequal place in @entity10 @entity1 's campaign faced a backlash when he said he was " not concerned " about the very poor			0
his comment that 47 % of @entity10 were " dependent upon the government " also became a political liability			0
but is political ignorance of poverty calculated ? the middle class supplies the greatest percentage of votes			1
and if people truly vote their interest , the middle class wants to hear how it would benefit			0
one voter who was squarely in the middle class said during @entity308 ' campaign that she could n't relate to what he was talking about			0
@entity175 , the @entity67 strategist , said the poor do n't vote , " which means their voices are not as loud in the political process as they should be -- especially given the number of children near , at or below the poverty line			2
" statistics do show that lower - income people are less likely to vote			1
according to @entity349 exit polls , those who made less than $ 15,000 per year made up 6 % of voters in 2008			0
more than 13 % of the overall population fell below the poverty line that year			2
fueled by a troubled economy , perhaps , politicians are looking to turn that philosophy on its head			2
philosophical divide deep philosophical divides on the best way to address the issue are likely , even if @entity192 take it on			0
@entity67 tend to support policies that involve more government and equitable wealth distribution , while @entity192 tend to back a " trickle - down " approach in which stronger upper - and middle - class economies benefit the poor			2
acknowledging the issue is the first step , said @entity227 , who runs the @entity228			0
" that 's the kind of dialogue that i 'm trying to get going , " he said			0
" i 'm trying to get both conservatives and liberals to debate which interventions improve the lives of poor people			0
" @entity378 : $ 15 minimum wage supporters vow to fight on			0

high - profile *republicans* are turning their attention to poverty
president @entity5 has shifted his attention to income inequality
a low - income mother of three has worked for years to get politicians to discuss poverty
ignorance of poverty by politicians calculated to appeal to a more engaged voting bloc
