@entity0 , @entity1 -- investigators seeking the cause of the mysterious crash of an @entity8 jet last year have significantly narrowed the area they are searching to find the wreckage , a top official said			1
@entity11 crashed into deep @entity13 waters on june 1 , killing all 228 people aboard			1
most of the bodies -- and the flight 's data recorders -- have never been recovered , despite extensive searches of the ocean floor			1
but the @entity1 air accident investigation agency , the @entity24 , is still hopeful , its head , @entity21 , told @entity2 on wednesday			2
" we have determined a much smaller area which is about one - tenth of the previous area " being searched , he said			2
investigators still do not know what brought down the plane , who was at the controls when it crashed , or what the pilots did in the moments leading up to the disaster , according to their latest report , released in december			1
but if they can locate the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder , they should be able to determine the circumstances " very quickly , some weeks after the readout of the recorders , " @entity21 said wednesday			2
the problem is that the plane went down in extremely deep water with enormous underwater mountains			1
" the area is very badly known , " @entity21 said , adding that ocean currents have not been mapped in the region , making it " difficult to analyze the trajectory of the debris			2
" we are in the middle of nowhere , " he said			2
two vessels , one @entity57 and one @entity58 , will trawl about 2,000 square kilometers in the latest phase of the search , which will last four weeks , he said			0
that 's down from about 17,000 square kilometers in the initial hunt last year			0
" so , of course , it 's much more easy to try to find the recorders , " he said			0
@entity21 said his agency is determined to press on with the hunt , even as the investigation threatens to become the most expensive in air accident history			0
" we have to perform this new phase because it 's the only chance we have to explain this accident , " he said			0
@entity72 , whose husband , @entity73 , died in the crash , said she does n't need to know the cause of the disaster			0
" it was an accident			0
no matter what , it 's not going to help me			0
... because it 's not going to bring him back , is it ? " she said			0
flight 447 -- an @entity84 -- went down in stormy weather in the @entity13 while flying from @entity86 , @entity87 , to @entity88 in @entity0 , @entity1			0
some debris and bodies have been recovered , and an examination shows the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact , officials have said			1
automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring airspeed , the investigators said in december			1
but that alone was not enough to cause the disaster , they added			0
tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes , which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air , and are part of a system used to determine air speed			1
before it crashed , @entity11 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through thunderstorms , officials have said			1
the @entity118 issued a directive in late august requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by @entity122 on @entity123 and @entity124			1
it said airlines should replace them with other @entity122 tubes and those manufactured by @entity130			1
@entity2 's @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
