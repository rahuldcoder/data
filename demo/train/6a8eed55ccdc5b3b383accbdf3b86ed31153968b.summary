-- " please tell me your name , " a robotic female voice says to the caller			2
" @entity6 , " the caller responds			0
" you said , ' @entity7			0
' is that right ? " so begins the exchange between actor @entity10 and the automated phone system in the 2007 film " @entity16 " -- a scene that correctly assumes moviegoers have had personal experience with the absurdity of non-human customer service			1
who has n't ? we 've all waited through the recitation of menu items , none of which were related to our actual question			2
we 've all hit zero repeatedly , hoping to be transferred to a real person			0
when that did n't work , maybe we even lost our temper , shouting " representative ! " over and over , whether the robot had given us that option or not			1
why has n't there been a mass revolt against automated systems ? the answer is simple : we believe that this nonsense is temporary			1
we believe that computers are on the cusp of being able to understand human language			1
and that belief , according to many linguists and cognitive scientists , is completely wrong			0
first , there 's the problem of voice recognition itself			0
@entity47 , a professor of linguistics and psychology at the @entity50 , told me that simply recognizing speech sounds and matching them up with specific words is much more complicated than most people realize			2
" the way i say ' dog ' will depend on my age , gender , geographic dialect , the particular anatomy of my vocal tract , and how quickly or formally i 'm speaking , " she said			0
" humans are able to calibrate their perception after hearing just a couple of seconds of someone 's speech , but really good speech recognition is still a problem for many programs			0
" although this technology has steadily improved for the past 20 years , " speech recognition systems are still markedly inferior to human beings in understanding spoken language , " said @entity70 , a linguist and information sciences professor based in @entity72			1
" telephones are a particularly difficult medium because they limit the signal a good deal			0
" furthermore , studies show that people almost universally hate automated phone systems , and that most customers are even willing to pay more to speak to an actual person			1
" @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 all have ads on television right now that brag about the fact that if you call the phone number , a real live person will answer , " said @entity87 , spokesperson for @entity88 , an organization dedicated to improving customer service			0
such is the sad state of the current customer service world			0
in other words , only now are companies starting to wake up to the lost revenue potential of frustrated customers who give up on the automated system and take their business elsewhere			1
" when you see companies launching ads like these , it shows they understand that there are things they can do to increase their future revenue by giving customers what they want : an actual person to speak to when they have an issue , " @entity87 said			1
maybe one day in the future , automated systems will be able to identify our words with perfect accuracy			1
even then , there is still an insurmountable problem : the ability to understand what we mean by those words			2
" we 're a long way from being able to communicate with computers in real language , " said @entity131 , director of @entity132 and associate professor of @entity134 at @entity135			2
" human language has a powerful design feature that works great for normal person - to - person interactions , but is completely at odds with the way computers work			1
" computers are based on formal logic and fixed categories , she explained			1
human language is flexible and dynamic , and follows a cognitive logic that differs fundamentally from computers			1
in short , human words and grammatical structures do n't have fixed meanings			1
instead , they have a certain amount of vagueness and ambiguity built in , so that their meaning is highly affected by context			2
actually understanding meaning is a very different problem from voice recognition or from the auto - correct on your computer or phone , @entity131 said			0
when i brought up this topic with @entity170 professor @entity169 , one of the world 's most influential linguists , he noted that major companies , by looking for statistical patterns in large datasets and applying them to user input , have largely dropped the ball when it comes to real artificial intelligence : " the stupidity of a lot of computer language understanding systems comes from the fact that they 've turned their backs on genuine intelligence and satisfied themselves with statistics			1
" in other words , computers are still very bad at trying to guess what we mean when we say something			2
they also do n't get our social and emotional psychology			2
" often the automated phone systems were developed with a tin ear to the way people interact with each other , " @entity196 told me			1
" they sound like people , but if you think of them as such , they are the most infuriating people in the world			0
when i hit ' 0 ' to get a human being , and a voice dripping with a combination of mock concern and mock confusion says , ' i 'm sorry , but i did not understand your answer , ' i am apt to go into a rage			1
" " if this were a real person , " @entity196 added , " she would be simultaneously stupid , mendacious , and condescending			0
" it 's time to stop the madness			0
we are not on the cusp of inventing computers that understand human language			1
@entity222 can , and will , continue to strive for this goal			0
in the meantime , let 's stop kidding ourselves			0
let 's admit that computers , by themselves , are terrible at customer service			0
let 's admit that , at a time of economic uncertainty and job losses , we should be supporting companies that employ real people to answer our questions			1
let 's admit that , unless we demand change , we will be forced , forever , to deal with an automated system that thinks our name is @entity7			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			2

@entity245 : we all know *futility* or trying to make automated systems understand us
we put up with it because we think the technology will soon be perfected -- it wo n't , he says
he says computers ca n't get human logic , ambiguity ; some firms put people back on phones
@entity243 : unless companies design systems based on human intelligence , they *'ll* never work
