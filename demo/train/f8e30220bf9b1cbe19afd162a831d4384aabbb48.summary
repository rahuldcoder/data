@entity0 there are no more tents on the streets in @entity5 and @entity6 and , in some ways , everything is back to normal			1
i have returned to my daily routine -- i go to school , attend lectures and work part time in a small tutorial center			1
my family is more than glad to see me resume my normal life			1
they do n't have to worry about receiving calls in the middle of the night informing them that their daughter has been arrested because she broke into a government building			2
my parents and my sister were really supportive when i was out there protesting			1
they never forced me to leave the streets			2
however , my parents took away my passport when i was invited to testify before the @entity30 parliament			2
they told me this was way too political			2
attending lectures again actually feels really good			2
i skipped most of my classes last semester as i used up all my energy during the nights protesting in @entity6 or in @entity5 and , of course , my results were poor			2
getting back to school is also a relief because i no longer have to worry about being hit by a police baton or being sprayed with pepper spray or tear gas			1
and now i do n't have to sleep on a solid concrete floor , i can finally get some rest at night			0
like other protest leaders , i 've faced some harassment since we left the streets			1
my @entity50 account has been hacked			0
i 'm also too terrified to travel across the border to mainland @entity52			1
one of my friends , another protester , was detained for more than four hours when she tried to travel there			0
luckily , she was only questioned and then sent back to @entity0 but i do n't have the courage to go back			1
but i 'm not giving up on striving for freedom and democracy here			0
i will continue to devote my time in @entity59 to defend internet freedom in @entity0			1
we want the government to abandon the implementation of the @entity64 to be @entity66 ( @entity65 ) , which allows internet users to delete search results about themselves on search engines if the information is outdated or inadequate , as it will undoubtedly hinder the free flow of information			0
it 's particularly important because @entity0 has no archives law so there 's little transparency			1
and to prolong the spirit of " @entity78 , " we are supporting a new political group formed online -- @entity80			0
it will field candidates in the coming district council election			0
we will do whatever we can to strive for freedom on the internet as we believe the @entity86 plays an important role in spreading news and information			0
i hope @entity0 can become a better place for us @entity91 to live			1
perhaps i 'm not the one most qualified to change the situation here , but i will not hesitate to try , because this is my hometown and i am bound by duty to protect it			0
facing the @entity52 government , a dictatorship that will not hesitate to hurt its own people , is really frightening			1
i feel helpless sometimes but i know i am not alone			0
i have my friends and my partners with me to fight for freedom and democracy here			0
with all of us making every effort to defend our rights , i know things will change eventually			0
