@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 sen. @entity3 kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts friday in @entity7 , @entity1 , that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign			1
@entity4 presidential hopeful @entity3 is competing for the black vote with @entity10			2
the concerts were meant to boost black voters ' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar			0
the ensuing controversy highlighted that @entity3 's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of " change " is not without some serious pitfalls			1
when the campaign announced the lineups for the three - city " embrace the @entity28 ! " gospel tour last week , one name stood out to gay bloggers : @entity32			2
the grammy - award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice , and that he was " once involved with those desires and those thoughts " but was able to get past them through prayer			2
to say the least , neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender community			0
@entity48 , a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the web site @entity51 , led the charge against the @entity3 campaign , writing that the @entity56 @entity55 was " sucking up to anti-gay bigots " and " giving them a stage			1
" when the story bubbled up into the mainstream media , it took the @entity3 campaign by surprise			2
@entity3 's efforts in the @entity1 have overwhelmingly targeted @entity66 churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in @entity1 from rival sen. @entity10			1
the campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate 's faith , launching " 40 days of @entity72 " in september , which used @entity74 study groups to tap into the black electorate			0
campaigners have run three radio ads , one of which called @entity3 a " @entity81 family man , " that aired on gospel stations across the state			0
earlier this month , @entity3 spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of @entity86 , where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with @entity81 vocabulary , telling the crowd , to much applause , that " i am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on @entity94			0
" after that appearance , the @entity3 campaign told @entity2 that @entity96 no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values			2
" i think that what you 're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the ' 90s , " @entity3 said			0
" at least in politics , the perception was that the @entity4 were fearful of talking about faith , and on the other hand you had the @entity96 who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away			0
" but on tuesday , @entity3 was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some @entity114 and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows , especially among blacks			1
@entity3 issued a statement saying , " i strongly disagree with @entity120 's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the @entity123 , " and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious @entity66			1
a september poll of @entity66 in @entity1 by @entity127 and @entity128 showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that " sex between two adults of the same sex " is " strongly unacceptable			1
" @entity3 held a conference call wednesday with @entity134 , president of the @entity135 , and announced that the rev. @entity136 , an openly gay @entity1 pastor , will appear at the same event as @entity32 on sunday in @entity0			1
@entity134 was not completely assuaged			0
" i spoke with senator @entity3 today and expressed to him our community 's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with @entity144 , an anti-gay preacher who states the need to ' break the curse of homosexuality , ' " he said in a statement			1
" there is no gospel in @entity32 's message for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people and their allies			0
that 's a message that certainly does n't belong on any presidential candidate 's stage			0
" the @entity159 newspaper in @entity0 reported friday that @entity3 organized a conference call thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders			2
after the call , the @entity163 announced it will hold a protest vigil outside sunday 's concert in @entity0			0
privately , @entity3 aides say they believe @entity3 is a candidate of real , transformational change , and that uproars like the @entity32 controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences			0
will @entity3 's refusal to kick @entity32 off the concert bill hurt him ? like many political squabbles , despite the national story , it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states : @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity1			1
and in @entity1 , where @entity66 make up about half of @entity4 primary - goers , voters might not have a problem with @entity32 at all			1

@entity3 holding concerts to win over @entity66 @entity114 in @entity1
but lineup offends homosexuals , angered by appearance of anti-gay singer
@entity3 *disavows* preacher - singer 's views , asks gay pastor to appear too
