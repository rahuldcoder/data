@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's raining on the camp , and water is seeping into the unheated tents			1
women use long brooms to try to sweep muddy water out from in between their shelters			0
they stack up foam sleeping pads and roll up blankets , in a vain attempt to keep them from getting soaked			0
when artillery rumbles in the distance , the camp 's residents do n't even flinch			2
like so many of the other children here , 9 - year - old @entity19 is wandering around the camp , bored			2
to keep his head dry , @entity19 wears an oversized leather jacket over his head			0
inside a pair of plastic sandals , his feet are bare , unprotected from the puddles and plummeting temperatures			0
" we 've been living here for a month ... it 's too small , it 's not big enough for us , " the surprisingly vocal little boy says , pointing at the tent where he and nine other family members sleep at night			2
@entity19 's family fled fighting in @entity40 , @entity1 's largest city , like many of the more than 6,000 people living in this rain - soaked camp , erected in a border customs compound on the @entity1 side of the border with @entity47			1
" we want to enter @entity47 ... they are not letting us in , " says @entity19			1
photos : life inside refugee camp refugees face brutal winter the @entity47 government says it no longer has room to house displaced @entity1 in the 14 refugee camps it is currently operating on @entity47 soil			1
unsafe in @entity1 , unwanted in @entity47 , these people are living in limbo			1
they are but a fraction of the legions of @entity1 made homeless by the war			2
according to the @entity64 ' admittedly conservative estimates , the conflict has pushed close to two million @entity1 out of their homes			1
in other words , roughly one in 10 @entity1 is now living on the run			2
the @entity64 says some 1.2 million @entity1 are displaced inside @entity1			1
meanwhile , more than half a million @entity1 have registered with the @entity64 high commissioner for refugees after fleeing across borders			1
and there are more coming every day			2
" since the beginning of november , the number of registered refugees region - wide has risen by about 3,200 a day , " the @entity73 announced this week			1
more : refugee figures only part of the crisis agency officials estimate there are hundreds of thousands of additional @entity1 refugees who have not registered with local authorities in @entity47 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , because they are surviving off of their savings or the hospitality of friends and relatives			1
but after more than 20 months of conflict , there are signs that resources for wealthier refugees are running out			2
" a lot of the increase is from people who are in neighboring countries but they 've run out of everything , " said @entity96 , a @entity73 spokesman in @entity97			2
" some of them have already been displaced internally for weeks and months moving from place to place and they are now coming out			0
and some of them are in a weakened state and the cold weather is certainly a danger to them , especially the children , " @entity96 added			0
" and these are people who lived a good life at one time			0
they had nice homes , they had good apartments , they had cars			0
" as @entity1 refugees go , @entity118 knows he is one of the luckier ones			1
after he ran away from @entity1 three months ago , @entity118 had enough money and connections to rent a small one - room apartment in @entity124 , where he practices his violin daily			1
more : inside @entity1 's underground tv channel " i feel so much ashamed of myself , being in a warm place and having my violin with me and playing music while people have to stand in long queues in order to have something to eat , " he says			1
insecurity and a feeling of hopelessness drove him to pack his bags and leave his home and parents in @entity141 , possibly forever			0
" i used to practice the violin while hearing gunshots just go by my window , " @entity118 recalls			0
now , this 32 - year - old violinist -- who used to perform at the @entity146 -- is one of the faceless millions of @entity1 now living on the run			1
" the moment when you know that this time , if you just pack and leave , you might not be able to decide the time when you come back ... that itself is a very painful experience , " @entity118 says			0
more : rebels say endgame in sight the exiled musician tries remain optimistic about the conflict that is ravaging his homeland			0
" if this is a part of a process which will make my country more free and a more promising nation that will have tolerance and social fairness and equality , then this the price that we have to pay , " he explains			0
@entity118 's future is uncertain			0
he does not know where he will be living several months from now , and he has no idea when he will be reunited with his sister , who fled with her husband and children to the @entity178 , or with his parents , who remain in @entity141			0
like so many others , @entity118 focuses on the present , unable to plan for the future			0
" we do n't think about the future any more , all we are waiting for is the toppling of the regime , " says @entity183 , a 24 - year - old resident of the camp in @entity185			0
he speaks while trimming a defected soldier 's hair in the makeshift barber shop he set up in his tent			0
he has a message for the international community			0
" i want people to feel our pain , " says @entity183 , who is bundled up in a sweatshirt and coat for warmth			1
" these are @entity203 , these are humans			1
i just want people to feel for us			2
" that appeal for empathy is echoed by the lone @entity1 violinist now living on the banks of @entity124 's @entity209			1
" if you look at these people as your brothers in humanity , " @entity118 says , after completing a mournful rendition of @entity215 's @entity214 , " then you should know that what is happening to them might happen to you one day			1

@entity47 say it 's out of room for displaced @entity1 in its 14 refugee camps
@entity64 : since november , registered refugees region - wide rising by 3,200 a day
refugee : " i want people to feel our pain . these are @entity203 , these are humans . "
