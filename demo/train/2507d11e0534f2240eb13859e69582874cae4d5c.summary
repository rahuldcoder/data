-- former @entity5 leader @entity4 intends to skip the start of his war crimes trial because he says he has had too little time to prepare , a spokeswoman for the @entity2 for the former @entity3 said thursday			1
@entity4 wrote to the court to say he would not attend the trial			1
the trial is still expected to begin on monday despite @entity4 's intended absence , which he announced in a letter to the court , the spokeswoman said			1
" the tribunal judges control court proceedings			0
they are the only relevant body that can make a decision about the readiness of the case for trial , " she said			0
@entity4 , who is defending himself , faces genocide charges and nine other counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity against @entity27 , @entity29 @entity28 and other @entity31 civilians during the brutal and bloody dissolution of @entity3 in the 1990s			1
the conflict introduced the phrase " ethnic cleansing " into the lexicon describing war crimes , as different factions in multi-ethnic @entity3 sought to kill or drive out other groups			1
@entity4 was arrested last year after more than a decade on the run and was found to have been living in @entity41 , the capital of @entity42 , and practicing alternative medicine in disguise			1
in a letter dated wednesday and made public thursday , @entity4 complains that he has not been given the relevant case material on time -- and he says the volume of material would have been too much to go through even if he had received it promptly			2
" i ask your excellencies -- why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to literally bury me under a million of pages , only to start disclosing relevant material many months after my arrest ? " he writes			0
" why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to file its final indictment against me on the eve of the planned trial date ? " @entity4 says he should not be penalized for representing himself			2
" no lawyer in this world could prepare defense within this period of time , " he writes			0
" i hereby inform you that my defense is not ready for my trial that is supposed to begin as scheduled , on the 26th of october , and that therefore i shall not appear before you on that date			0
" he promised to continue his preparations in " the most intensive way " and inform the court when he is ready			0
the genocide charges against him stem partly from the most notorious massacre of the war in @entity29 , once a part of @entity3			1
more than 7,000 @entity27 men and boys were killed at @entity82 when ethnic @entity42 troops overran a @entity85 " safe area " in july 1995			2
it was the worst @entity87 massacre since @entity88 prosecutors at the @entity85 war crimes tribunal in the @entity91 accuse @entity4 of responsibility			1
" on 8 march 1995 , @entity4 instructed @entity5 forces under his command to create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival for the inhabitants of @entity82 , amongst other places , " the tribunal said in a statement this month			2
the @entity91 indictment also says @entity4 committed genocide when forces under his command killed non-serbs during and after attacks in more than a dozen @entity29 municipalities in the early stages of the war			1
@entity4 , who faces life in prison if he is convicted , denies the charges			2
the court can not impose the death penalty			0
when he was arrested in july 2008 , @entity4 had grown a large white beard and let his famous steel - gray hair grow long and turn white			2
he had spent more than 13 years in hiding , during which he practiced alternative medicine at a @entity41 clinic			0
@entity4 's arrest leaves his former military commander , @entity122 , as the highest - ranking fugitive still being sought by the war crimes tribunal			1
prosecutor @entity125 told the court in july that the case against @entity4 would take approximately 490 hours			0
that means prosecutors are likely to need more than a year to lay out their evidence , a court spokeswoman said			0
the 1992 - 95 @entity29 war was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of @entity3 in the early 1990s			1
backed by the government of then - @entity3 president @entity138 , @entity5 forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the @entity143 and @entity144 populations			0
@entity4 was removed from power in 1995 , when the @entity146 that ended the @entity29 war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office			1
@entity138 died in 2006 while on trial at the @entity91 .			0
