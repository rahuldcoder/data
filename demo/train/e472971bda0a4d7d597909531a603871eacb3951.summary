last week the world welcomed its 7 billionth inhabitant			2
but behind the headlines is a complicated demographic picture -- and one that masks huge disparities			2
the current rate of growth means that there are 78 million more people every year			1
nearly all of that growth -- 97 out of every 100 people - is occurring in less developed countries			1
in developed nations , on the other hand , population growth rate has largely stagnated : in @entity18 and @entity19 for instance , bringing with it concerns about lower fertility and aging			1
@entity25 's rapid population growth -- 2.3 per cent a year , double the rate of @entity27 's -- puts pressure on its economies as governments struggle to provide education and health services			1
the issue of women and children 's health is one of the most pressing			1
births that are too early , late or closely spaced reveal a whole host of critical issues affecting the health of @entity42			0
i believe the population issue in @entity25 is one of gender			1
too many women lack the freedom to exercise choice when it comes to childbearing			1
often this is a question of access			0
in remote locations women are forced to walk many kilometers to obtain contraceptives , and in some areas they are simply not available			1
across the world more than two in five pregnancies are unplanned			0
clearly ' unmet need ' for contraception is a wasted opportunity to boost development and stabilize population growth through something women want and need : the ability to decide when to become pregnant			1
just how big is 7 billion if all women had this ability , survey data shows , average global childbearing would immediately fall below the ' replacement fertility ' value of slightly more than two children per woman			1
then there 's social pressure			1
women are often required to have large families to improve their social standing and ensure their economic survival			2
in many countries girls marry at a very young age , become pregnant too early and cut short their education to take care of their young family			0
poorly educated and unable to work , they are unable to contribute financially to the family coffers and so the cycle of poverty is perpetuated			0
in addition , young mothers face terrible threats to their health such as fistula -- a hole in the birth canal caused by prolonged labor without prompt medical intervention			0
fistula leaves women with chronic incontinence which renders them a social outcast			2
the link between family size and social standing is a subject close to my heart and goes back to my own childhood in @entity112 , a small town in @entity113 , where i grew up the eldest of seven children			0
my grandmother had one child , my mother , and i vividly recall the shame that she was made to feel because she had given birth to ' just one child ' -- and a daughter at that			0
i also remember that girls in my class at school would disappear suddenly and re-appear around a year later			2
as i grew older i realized that these young girls had become pregnant , and had been forced to move to other villages due to the shame they had been made to feel			0
my own mother lost a child , and i recall the deep emotional trauma that followed			0
so i encountered something of the suffering felt by far too many @entity42 women			2
that 's why i believe women must be empowered to be able to make their own decisions free from fear of coercion or pressure from partners , family , and society			1
their sense of self - worth should not depend on the number of children they have			0
they must have easy access to a range of safe , effective , and affordable contraceptives and the information and counseling needed to use them			0
six of world 's fastest - growing cities in @entity157 but contraceptive access needs to be backed by better health infrastructure - we have abundant evidence that when parents are confident that their children will survive , they will have fewer and invest more in each of them			2
after years of neglect , there is a renewed interest in family planning as a driver for development			0
experience has shown us that education for girls , legal reform and access to family planning have made a difference in many countries			0
while it 's true that economic and social development leads to women having smaller families , the converse is also true -- that the gains that contraception has made possible in women 's health make family planning one of the most successful international development stories			1
my mission as @entity194 's new director - general is to build on those gains , to do our utmost to ensure that @entity25 's women and girls have the services , supplies and information to exercise their reproductive rights and live their lives with dignity , respect and meaning .			1

the current growth rate means that there are 78 million more people every year
@entity25 's population growth , of 2.3 *%* , is double that of @entity27 's
@entity214 believes @entity25 's population issue is because women lack freedom
