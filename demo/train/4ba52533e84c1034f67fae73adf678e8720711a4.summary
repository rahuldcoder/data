-- an update rolling out tuesday for the @entity3 network aims to do what @entity4 has been teasing for a while -- turn a platform designed primarily for video games into one that will be the major hub for all television viewing			1
@entity4 promises the update , which it calls " the future of tv , " can " transform every @entity12 into an all - in - one device to enjoy your entertainment			1
" " the update is another huge step toward realizing our vision of bringing you all your entertainment , shared with the people you care about , in an easy way , " @entity19 , @entity4 's corporate vice president for @entity3 , wrote on the official @entity4 blog			1
the @entity29 was the first gaming console to include @entity30 and has since added entertainment partners such as @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and last.fm			0
but @entity4 , hoping a bevy of new apps will up the ante , is adding content from 40 new partners while making existing content easier to view			2
one of the free update 's key new features will be a voice - control interface that will let users retrieve videos , television channels , games or other content simply by asking for it			1
the feature combines the @entity12 's hands - free @entity53 system with technology from @entity4 's @entity57 search engine to hunt down the content			1
primarily billed as a gaming tool , @entity53 uses a @entity62 video camera and voice recognition to let the user interact with the tv screen without a controller			2
the new partners , or updated apps , to be unveiled tuesday include content from @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity30 and @entity69 in the @entity70			0
in the coming weeks and months , @entity29 will add @entity71 , @entity73 's @entity72 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity77 's @entity76 on demand			0
@entity79 , @entity74 's parent company , also owns @entity0			0
@entity4 said the update will also add social features , from voting on who you think will win the big game to tools letting you notify friends when you 're tackling a multiplayer game they can join			0
at a time when technology heavyweights such as @entity91 and @entity92 are trying to gain footholds in the interactive tv market , some analysts are saying @entity4 has become the player to beat			0
" @entity4 has just built and delivered it : a single box that ties together all the content you want , made easily accessible through a universal , natural , voice - directed search , " wrote @entity97 of @entity98			2
" this is now the benchmark against which all other living room initiatives should be compared			0
" with 57 million @entity105 already in folks ' living rooms , and 35 million of them connected to @entity3 , @entity97 predicts that adoption of the new features " will spread quickly and with devastating effect			1

@entity3 update promises an all - in - one device for tv viewing
apps , including content from 40 new partners , will *improve* tv and video , @entity4 says
@entity12 's @entity53 system will let users surf channels through voice control and *gestures*
