" it was a difficult decision for some countries , but it was necessary and right to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in @entity8 , " he said in a written statement			1
the violence continued in the war - torn nation as bloody children were rushed into a dirty makeshift clinic in the @entity8 city of @entity24			1
@entity24 , near the border with @entity26 , is a strategic area where food , medicine and other supplies are hustled along routes used by government fighters and those trying to oust the government			2
@entity0 talked via @entity35 on monday with a citizen journalist who described a desperate and horrid situation			2
the main hospital in @entity24 has been obliterated by fighting , the source said , not wishing to be named out of concern for security			0
the wounded are being crammed into homes			0
and , as one @entity47 video shows , they apparently being treated at a makeshift clinic			1
@entity0 can not verify the authenticity of the video			2
it 's hard to watch			0
a boy wearing a purple shirt comes in screaming , his head bloody			0
the camera closes in on a baby			0
the child wails as people holding a steel instrument trying to dislodge something from the child 's ear			0
the walls are smeared with blood			0
@entity66 , @entity4 high representative , announced the end of the embargo , reading a declaration from the organization 's @entity70			1
part of it states : " with regard to the possible export of arms to @entity8 , the @entity70 took note of the commitment by @entity79 to proceed in their national policies as follows : the sale , supply , transfer or export of military equipment or of equipment which might be used for internal repression will be for the @entity89 and intended for the protection of civilians			1
" in @entity93 , the @entity6 ' human rights commissioner spoke as she has several times before during the two - year war in @entity8			1
@entity100 , in opening remarks at the first session of the @entity99 's three - week conference , said the situation has deteriorated to an " intolerable affront to the human conscience , " and the @entity104 must mete out justice to those who 've violated the rights of @entity8			1
" i feel utter dismay , " she said			0
@entity110 's full remarks to the rights council @entity100 reminded listeners that the war in @entity8 began in march 2011 as a peaceful demonstration against president @entity115 and has devolved into a complicated bloodbath of sect battles and terrorist fighters			1
" whenever their governments can not or will not protect them , frightened human beings are dependent on the international community for protection and assistance , " she said			2
" we can not -- we must not -- continue to ignore their plea			0
" amid the backdrop of the @entity93 conference came word that sen. @entity132 was inside @entity8 on monday and met with rebels , making him the highest ranking @entity135 official to visit during the war			1
the senator 's communications director , @entity137 , confirmed the trip			0
@entity140 , the executive director for the @entity142 - based @entity141 , said @entity132 met with 18 commanders of the @entity144 about 1 kilometer from the border with @entity146 in northern @entity8			1
" their main message was that we are desperate for ammunition , we are desperate for weapons , " @entity140 said			0
" they are confident that if the weapons are given to the supreme military council , that it will not fall in the wrong hands			2
" @entity132 met with the commanders , which included the top leader of the rebel force , for about an hour			1
it 's often difficult to discern exactly what is happening @entity8 because @entity115 has made it difficult if not deadly for foreign journalists to enter the nation			1
a state tv reporter , @entity165 , was killed in @entity24 on monday , according to @entity8 state television			1
she died after " terrorists targeted " a state tv crew near @entity170 airport north of the strategic city near @entity26 , where rebels and government forces run supply routes			2
in @entity93 , @entity100 talked about @entity24			1
" i am extremely concerned at current reports suggesting that hundreds of civilians have been killed or injured , and thousands may remain trapped , by indiscriminate shelling and aerial attacks by government forces in @entity24 , " @entity100 said			1
safe passage must be given to any civilians wishing to leave			0
" outside reports indicate rebels continue to fight for the cause that began the unrest : ousting @entity115 and allowing @entity8 greater freedom , something akin to the goals of the wider @entity191 movement			1
those who want @entity115 gone claim that the president has ordered his forces to slay families and indiscriminately shell neighborhoods across the country , which is about the size of @entity198			0
@entity199 says his forces are trying to save the country from " terrorists			0
" " these war crimes and crimes against humanity can not be allowed to go unpunished , " @entity100 told delegates from around the world			1
" we must make it clear to both ( the @entity115 government ) and the armed opposition groups that there will be consequences for those responsible			0
and the world must take action to end this terrible conflict			2
" @entity100 's remarks came as @entity135 secretary @entity217 met in @entity218 with @entity220 foreign minister @entity219			1
the two diplomats spoke briefly to reporters monday before heading off to a private dinner with the @entity225 foreign minister			0
@entity217 expressed concern about any possible use of chemical weapons and the need to determine what is happening on the ground , while @entity219 stressed the situation in @entity8 is n't getting any better and that he wants to do everything in his power to stop the bloodshed			1
for months during the @entity8 war , @entity220 appeared to be supporting @entity115			2
but that tide may be turning , at least gaining some wiggle room for the @entity220 to help broker an end to the violence			2
@entity0 's security clearance : @entity220 blasts @entity243 's recognition of rebels @entity135 officials want to start talks between the government and groups that want @entity115 gone			2
but not everyone involved in @entity8 wants to engage			2
the @entity250 , based in @entity251 , is part of the main opposition umbrella group and is considered to be composed of hardliners who 've said they 'll never talk or negotiate with anyone representing the @entity115 regime			2
the group was having meetings over the weekend in @entity251 to consider attending the @entity93 conference			1
@entity89 spokesman @entity260 said the group wants to hear " more clarity about the purpose and the intentions of the @entity8 regime			1
" so far , " he said , " the signals have been not positive			0
" at the start of may , the @entity6 's point man on @entity8 , @entity267 , called @entity219 and @entity217 's cooperation to forge a solution to the @entity8 conflict " the first hopeful news concerning that unhappy country in a very long time			1
" @entity219 told @entity273 recently that the @entity135 and @entity220 have a lot in common			0
asked about his " famously contentious relationship " with @entity279 administration secretary of state @entity277 , @entity219 laughed			0
" well , i do n't engage in comparing my partners , " he said			0
" @entity217 is a professional			0
and this is a very important quality for a diplomat and especially for a secretary of state			0
" he has very good knowledge of things around the world			0
he has keen interest in moving some of the old problems out of the deadlock			0
" @entity219 also was asked about @entity217 's criticism that @entity220 is still selling weapons to @entity8			2
" well , you know on the arms sales , we never , we never tried to hide that we are implementing the contracts which have been signed quite some time ago , long before all this started , " he answered , saying his country has provided @entity8 with defensive weapons			1
" we have been consistent , " he told @entity273			0
" we have been saying that for us priority no. 1 is to stop the bloodshed and to save lives , and therefore cessation of hostilities and dialogue without any preconditions is the best way to achieve this desired goal			0
" while diplomats talked , on monday at least 35 people were killed in @entity8 , including two women and two children , according to the opposition group @entity312 in @entity8			1
