@entity0 , @entity1 -- somehow , the hundreds of thousands of @entity1 who ca n't -- or wo n't -- leave this battleground city have grown accustomed to living in a state of war			2
but they have also shown that they do not want to live in a state of anarchy			2

he sat in an office , signing legal documents and stamping them with the council 's seal , oblivious to thunderous explosions echoing outside			1
" we have a deteriorating humanitarian situation , " he added			2
" we came to work to stop people like the @entity83 or others from taking advantage of the weak and to maintain law and order inside liberated areas			1
" the @entity83 is the main rebel force fighting the government of president @entity90			2

the council has about 100 prisoners detained in a series of makeshift jail cells in a basement that resembles a dungeon			1
in the " military prison , " a court founded by rebels has incarcerated rebels accused of committing war crimes			1
during a visit by @entity2 journalists , more than a dozen men sat on mats in a cavernous room			2
some of the inmates said they were there on charges of robbery and theft			2
others , like a bearded fighter who called himself @entity121 , were being investigated for leading men into a battle that resulted in the friendly fire deaths of many fellow rebels			1

yet at first glance , inmates there appeared to be treated better than at another makeshift rebel jail @entity2 visited in northern @entity1 last august			1
there , @entity2 saw more than 40 prisoners being held at a time in a single , over-crowded room			1
some of those detainees , especially members of the shabiha militia , showed obvious signs of torture			0
at the @entity24 jail in @entity0 , the prison warden led visitors to another cell , where men sat with their backs to the walls under heavy blankets			1
one inmate read a newspaper			0
" this section is for shabiha , informants , collaborators , spies and homosexuals , " said the warden , who asked to be named only @entity187			0
@entity187 , a former officer from @entity1 's foreign security service , insisted he was trying to reform rather than punish the prisoners by giving them regular lessons in @entity198			1
in fact , one of the judges explained that he and his colleagues are following a " @entity203 " adopted by the @entity204 , which is rooted in @entity198 law			1
" this basically follows sharia , while taking into consideration modern @entity210 life , " said @entity206			0

" this is especially true in the women 's jail cell , where most of the inmates hid their faces under blankets during a visit by @entity2			1
among the detainees was a teenage girl , the daughter of a couple who were both also incarcerated in the prison			0
some of the women were also accused of spying for the @entity1 regime			0
one woman stood and repeatedly performed a salute , accompanied by a martial stamp of her foot			0
asked who she was saluting , she listed the names of the father and son who have ruled @entity1 for 40 years : " president @entity257 , president @entity90			0
" " may @entity131 give victory to @entity90 , " she said with a smile			0

" one might assume the @entity24 had been formed to create a rival judicial structure to the @entity1 government , which is believed to control a quarter to a third of @entity0			1
the @entity1 crisis : where 's @entity276 aid going ? but a visit to the office of @entity61 , the council 's prosecutor , revealed political tension between rival rebel groups			1
the suavely dressed former judge had a half dozen guests seated around his desk , most of whom were lawyers hoping to set up a similar court in the opposition - held northern town of @entity291			1
there was also a stocky , bearded man dressed in a camouflage uniform who quickly excused himself after journalists entered the room			0
" the man was here from @entity299 , " @entity61 explained after the man left			0
" he was asking me to hand over a prisoner to his court system			0
i said no. " @entity299 , or @entity299 , is a well - organized @entity303 fighting group			1
the @entity276 government recently black - listed the group , accusing of it being a terrorist organization			2
" we black - listed the @entity299 because of its intimate links with @entity72 in @entity311 , " said @entity306 , the former @entity276 ambassador to @entity1 , in an interview with @entity2 in @entity308			2
" @entity312 has a sectarian agenda ... ( it ) is anti-democratic and will seek to impose its very strict interpretation of @entity198 on @entity1 , " @entity306 said			0
but @entity61 , asked about @entity299 , called its members " our brothers in the revolution			0
but we differ on how to build the state			0
" " we are calling for a civil democratic nation			0
they call for an @entity198 state , " he said			0
" the @entity276 and the @entity325 did n't help us , and that created an increase in @entity198 radicalism			0
... " up until now we can control the situation , " @entity61 warned			0
" but later on , we may not be able to contain it			0

the @entity24 is working to expand its law - and - order model to other communities in the largely rebel - held north			1
it is a desperate strategy , council members admitted , aimed at preventing @entity1 from descending further into chaos			2

the @entity24 operates in areas controlled by rebels
it is a self - appointed council of judges , lawyers and clerics
it *protects* the weak and maintains order in liberated areas , an official says
about 100 prisoners are detained in a series of makeshift jail cells
