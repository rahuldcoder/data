@entity0 -- royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child who will be heir to the @entity6 throne			1
here 's what you need to know and the latest developments : as the wait for the royal baby continues , so does the debate over the duchess of @entity15 's actual due date			1
@entity6 's @entity17 newspaper reports friday , citing " well - placed sources , " that medical staff at @entity19 -- where @entity20 is expected to give birth -- were told the due date was july 19			1
a royal source told @entity1 that her due date was july 13			1
she and prince @entity26 announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in july , but did not announce the date			1
why are some babies overdue ? @entity31 of @entity15 is expected to give birth in the private @entity33 of @entity19 , next to @entity34 in @entity0			1
it 's where @entity26 was born , as was his brother @entity37			0
@entity20 's mother , @entity38 , is likely to be on hand at the hospital			1
could the world 's media be camped outside the wrong hospital , though ? the @entity17 reported that a contingency plan is in place for @entity20 to give birth at the @entity47 in @entity48 , if she goes into labor while staying at her parents ' home in @entity52 , and its swift progress means the journey back to @entity0 is impractical			1
there 's no doubting the media interest in the royal birth			1
the @entity60 newspaper is streaming live video of the entrance to the @entity63 , as is @entity64			0
the days - long vigil outside the hospital has also inspired a spew of # @entity69 tweets from the waiting media pack -- as rounded up by @entity71			2
one person who wo n't be at the @entity63 is home secretary @entity73			2
asked by a fellow lawmaker whether she would be attending the royal birth , as was formerly customary , she replied : " in fact , it is no longer the case that the home secretary is required to attend a royal birth			2
the tradition -- now defunct -- goes back many centuries , she said , explaining that " the home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby had n't been smuggled in			1
" some people are thinking further ahead already			0
an @entity87 poll released thursday revealed almost two - thirds of those surveyed think @entity26 and @entity20 's child should have a normal job before taking on royal duties			1
however , 70 % of those polled think that it is impossible for the children of royalty to have a normal upbringing			0
the same survey found support for @entity6 's monarchy remains high , with more than three - quarters in favor of a monarchy over a republic			2
there 's been plenty of speculation about the baby 's name -- and betting is going strong			1
the famous @entity111 in @entity0 , which takes in and finds homes for lost and unwanted pets , has gone a step further and named a litter of kittens after the bookies ' favorites : @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
@entity121 is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world			0
on a visit to northern @entity130 on wednesday , she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great - grandchild to be a boy or a girl			2
the queen replied : " i do n't think i mind			2
i would very much like it to arrive			0
i 'm going on holiday			0
" prince @entity138 ' wife , @entity137 , the @entity137 , said monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby 's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon			1
" we 're all waiting at the end of a telephone , " she said , in an exchange filmed by @entity144			0
" i hope by the end of the week , he or she will be there			0
" the baby will have the title @entity159 prince or @entity156 ( the baby 's name ) of @entity15 , @entity154 said this month			1
however , it could be as long as 10 days before the baby 's name is announced			1
anyone born in @entity6 on the same day as @entity26 and @entity20 's baby will receive a special coin from the @entity166 : a silver penny , dated 2013 , that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl			1
the first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor , royal sources tell @entity1			1
the next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth			0
it will be made in the form of a formal bulletin , signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to @entity190			0
there , the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce @entity26 's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see			2
the first to know about the royal baby will be @entity121 , prime minister @entity198 and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations , along with the rest of the royal and @entity38 families			1
if the baby arrives in the middle of the night , it 's unlikely the queen will be awoken , so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning			2
celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the @entity214 in @entity215 ( 41 rounds ) and the @entity217 at the @entity218 ( 62 rounds ) after the baby is born			0
@entity26 and @entity20 did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand , royal sources say			1
there has been speculation it is a girl , however , especially after a member of the public said in march that the duchess almost uttered " daughter " while at a public event in @entity231			0
the woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied , " thank you , i will take that for my d -- " but then stopped herself			0
the baby will be third in line to the throne after @entity138 and prince @entity26 , regardless of gender			0
a rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture , which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons			0
it means that if the next royal baby is a girl , she will eventually become queen ; previously , a younger male sibling would have taken precedence			1
the queen 's cousin , @entity256 , told @entity1 's @entity258 she hoped the child would have a normal childhood			2
" i imagine and hope that its early life , until it 's at least in its teens , will be just a jolly , happy , ordinary child 's life , " she said			0
it 's not known where the @entity266 and @entity267 plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth			2
@entity26 is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the @entity272 , royal sources say			0
he will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot			0
the revelation that @entity20 was pregnant came after she was admitted to a @entity0 hospital in december for acute morning sickness .			0

new : poll suggests @entity6 want the royal heir to lead a normal life -- including a regular job
the media debate @entity20 's likely due date as the wait for the royal baby continues
the queen does n't mind if the baby 's a boy or a girl -- she just wants it to arrive soon
