-- two years after losing part of her lung during an operation to remove a life - threatening blood clot , newly - crowned @entity7 champion @entity6 insists playing tennis " is just fun now			1
" the world @entity10 's battle - weary opponents might not be having so much fun after @entity6 successfully defended the @entity14 title she won in 2012 against the same opponent , beating second seed @entity16 7 - 5 6 - 7 6 - 1 to secure her fifth singles championship in @entity18			1
it is a far cry from where the now 17 - time grand slam singles champion was in july 2010 when she suffered a cut to her right foot and was later diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism which left her on her death bed			1
that 11 months of " hell " culminated in her descent to no. 175 in the world rankings in july 2011			1
since then four grand slams have been won by @entity6 during a truly dominant 14 - month spell			1
one more major triumph would see her sit level with legendary compatriots @entity35 and @entity37 in fourth position on the list of the most prolific female grand slam champions of all time			1
" it was the toughest thing i 've been through in my life , " the 31 - year - old told @entity0			1
" one thing kept happening after another , blood clots in both of my lungs , i lost part of my lung , i had to retrain			1
i do n't have two full lungs anymore			2
" you go through this stage of thinking , ' why does all of this keep happening			0
' it was really 11 months of hell			0
" when i 'm on that court and i 'm facing opponents , i feel like i 've faced so many tougher opponents that this is just fun now			0
" @entity6 ' lung problems only became obvious when she was rushed into hospital after experiencing breathing difficulties en route to an @entity66 party in march 2011			1
" being in the emergency room and being in hospital for all of that time , not knowing if i would ever pick up a racket again , not even caring , just wanting to be healthy , " recalled @entity6			1
" that was a tough time for me			0
" she is indeed healthy again and operating at the peak of her powers at an age when many of her contemporaries are seemingly struggling to last the pace			0
@entity77 has seen his vice-like grip on men 's tennis loosen as he heads deeper into his 30s , while @entity82 champion @entity81 retired last month at the age of 28			2
however , @entity6 maintains a childlike enthusiasm for sport , aided in no small way by the perspective she gained during her battle to regain her form and fitness			2
" i feel like just going for broke now , " she said			0
" i 'm really focused on what i want to do , i 'm just having a lot of fun out there			0
" i 'm like ' 31 is old , ' but that does n't seem like me			0
i do n't act like it [ her age ] either so maybe that has something to do with it			0
" @entity6 ' muscular physique sets her apart from physically smaller opponents and she remains proud of how she managed to combine power with femininity			2
" it 's ok to be strong and to be powerful and to be beautiful and to love who you are , " she added			2
" you can stand up to anyone and you can be proud of who you are , where you come from and be a positive awesome girl			0
