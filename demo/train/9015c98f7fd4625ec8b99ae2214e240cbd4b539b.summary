that 's how many trophies the cast and crew of " @entity6 " have hauled home after five seasons of groundbreaking tv , with six of those honors being earned at monday 's 66th @entity11			1
the three - hour ceremony , hosted by " @entity14 's " @entity13 , nearly doubled as one long standing ovation for the @entity17 series , which ended its run in september 2013			1
@entity11 : ' @entity6 ' goes out on top but as creator @entity21 and stars @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 laid " @entity6 " to rest with gleaming @entity26 in their hands , elsewhere in the world the series is just getting started			1
in september , @entity29 will get its own , spanish - language version of " @entity6 " called " metastasis			1
" the premise is the same -- a science teacher decides to cash in on his specialized knowledge by entering the drug trade , to devastating consequences -- but the setting is @entity38 , @entity39			0
instead of watching the evolution of a man named @entity43 ( played by @entity23 in " @entity6 " ) , potential fans will follow @entity44 , as played by @entity39 actor @entity45			1
@entity44 has wife a named @entity47 -- the @entity39 equivalent of @entity24 's @entity49 -- and a partner - in - crime named @entity51 , the equivalent of @entity25 's @entity53			1
the series debuted in the @entity55 on the @entity56 in june , and has also made its way to @entity58			1
but " in @entity39 , not many people know about ' @entity6 , ' " @entity45 explained in an interview from @entity38			1
" there 's not a great cable culture here , people watch open television on the basic channels that we have			2
' metastasis ' is going to be a great surprise			0
" while adapting shows to another language is commonplace -- @entity45 previously worked on @entity29 versions of " @entity73 " and " @entity74 , " and the @entity75 turned @entity39 series " @entity77 " into " @entity78 " -- producing " metastasis " was no easy task			1
the cast had to film the entirety of " @entity6 " nearly shot for shot in just six months , and they did n't know how the story was going to end because the final season of " @entity6 " was still in development at the time			1
despite those challenges , the story does n't get lost in translation			0
well - crafted symbolism , such as the noteworthy pink teddy bear that falls from a plane , appears in " metastasis , " as do other scenes well - known to " @entity6 " viewers			1
" the themes that it touches are very universal , " @entity97 said			0
" to me , the show is a moral question about how far you would go while exploring the complex character like that of @entity43			0
" one of @entity43 's scenes that strikes a chord with @entity45 takes place near the end of the series , when the " metastasis " protagonist comes back to see his wife @entity47 and say goodbye to her and their baby girl			1
" that 's @entity43 and that 's what all the characters are , " @entity45 said			2
" every scene is full of contradiction , it 's full of humanity			2
" while both @entity45 and @entity97 were certainly influenced by @entity23 and @entity25 's portrayals of @entity43 and @entity53 , they made an effort to break away from the original and make the characters , and the show , their own			2
" when you start working with a different language , with a different director , a different cast , and our own traditions , at the end you really do your own version , " @entity45 said			2
" characters come alive by themselves			0
you forget very soon what you saw , and the reference you have of the other actor			0
" when @entity97 first began filming , he was too attached to @entity25 's portrayal of @entity53 , with the memory of " @entity6 " scenes ingrained in his mind			1
yet by making a conscious effort to start from scratch , he said he reimagined his @entity51			0
" i think the biggest difference between @entity53 and @entity51 is they are both very insecure people , but i think @entity53 's character shows that through aggression and violence , while @entity51 , i tried to make him a little more vulnerable , " @entity97 said			2
" i think you are able to relate more to him and feel what he is feeling			0
he 's not a character afraid of showing his sadness , his emotion			2
" there are other factors that distinguish " metastasis " from " @entity6			1
" the setting of @entity38 moves the story into the urban environment of a big city , as opposed to @entity169 's suburban landscape			2
the city also lacks deserts , or the border and immigration issues prevalent in @entity169			0
with its high elevation , @entity38 is cold year - round , so the pool in @entity43 's backyard is replaced by a fountain , which @entity47 falls into as she 's having a dream			1
the rv where @entity43 and @entity53 make their great escape in the " @entity6 " pilot is also replaced by a rickety school bus turned into a lab for " metastasis			1
" although they 're sharing similar material , there 's no competition for the actors			2
quite the opposite , actually : @entity97 and @entity45 were both rooting for " @entity6 " to win at the emmys on monday			1
" @entity23 's performance is absolutely wonderful			0
he deserves all the awards , as well as the rest of ( the cast ) , " @entity45 said			0
" i think they are just great actors , and they did a great , great job			0
" so far , @entity97 and @entity45 have n't been doing too badly with the roles themselves			0
the actors said @entity21 admires " metastasis , " and they 've received positive feedback from fans near and far			0
" i have gotten an amazing response from people all over , people in @entity58 and the @entity55 , " @entity97 said			1
" there was this one guy in @entity58 that wrote to me , and it was very touching because he identified with the character			1
he went down on drugs and he lost his girlfriend and he was reaching out , not for help , but to connect and to grieve			0
so i think it has touched people in a very powerful way			0
" there is only more to come , as the much anticipated season finale airs on @entity220 in mid-september , and " metastasis " comes to @entity29 audiences with @entity223 on september 1			1
" the story is really well - adapted to our conditions here , " @entity45 said			0
" people are going to believe it , believe the people			0
it 's an amazing story , and i 'm sure it 's going to be really well received			0
