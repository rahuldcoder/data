-- in a move aimed at boosting mental health treatment , @entity2 secretary @entity1 on friday announced new rules that will put teeth in a 2008 mental health equity law			1
the @entity8 and @entity9 , signed by president @entity10 , requires doctors and insurers to treat mental illness the same as physical illness			1
@entity1 made the announcement to applause at the @entity18 on @entity19 in @entity20			1
the move " finally puts mental health and behavioral health on equal footing , " @entity1 said			1
on paper , the law made mental health more accessible , but there has been virtually no enforcement of it , said dr. @entity31 , president of the @entity32 and a @entity34 psychiatrist			2
" up to now , the law has not been complied with , " @entity31 said			2
" companies have only sort of adhered to it			2
" insurance companies often cover mental illness in a more limited fashion than physical illness			1
now the rule will require insurers to charge similar co-payments regardless if the treatment is for physical or mental health			2
deductibles and doctor visits would also be equitable , and there would be parity in outpatient services and residential treatment			0
" many private insurers gave nothing			2
some provided benefits , but they were limited and inadequate , " @entity31 said			2
the law , the new rules and provisions of @entity58 combined will ensure mental and physical illness would be covered similarly			1
@entity61 ( @entity61 ) , the professional association that represents the health insurance industry , said it has long supported the act and has worked to implement its requirements in an affordable and effective way			0
" we appreciate that the final rule enables patients with mental and behavioral health conditions to continue to benefit from the innovative programs and services health plans have pioneered , " @entity61 's president and ceo @entity67 said in a statement			0
opinion : wipe out the stigma of mental illness for example , insurance companies can no longer authorize a 30 - day hospital stay for a stroke and only a two - day stay in the hospital for someone who has had a psychotic break			1
in addition , people with pre-existing mental conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or depression will no longer be denied insurance coverage -- and under @entity58 , a mental illness diagnosis will no longer trigger a potential loss of coverage			1
about one in four adults suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year , according to the @entity97			0
@entity1 pointed out that twice as many people die from suicides as homicides			2
the " incredibly important law , combined with the @entity58 , will expand and protect behavioral health benefits for more than 62 million @entity103 , " @entity1 said			1
" people who either have insurance coverage now and have no mental health coverage or where the @entity58 fills in those gaps for people who have no insurance at all , they will be able to access affordable care with mental health and substance abuse benefits			2
" she called it " the largest expansion of behavioral health benefits in a generation			0
" that is , if there are enough providers to deal with the potential influx of new patients			0
" the not - so - good news is you are eligible for treatment now , but often the services are not available , " said @entity121 , an attorney who specializes in cases involving mental illness			1
surveys show there are only about 50,000 psychiatrists in the @entity103			0
according to the @entity32 , that number is already too few to care for the existing number of people seeking treatment			0
and trends for the profession do n't sound promising , according to the association			0
enrollment in psychiatry programs is down , and over half of the profession is 55 or older which means they are nearing retirement age			0
often , @entity145 said , psychiatrists and psychologists do n't take insurance , and patients struggling with mental illness or the families who care for them are too overwhelmed to have to process the paperwork themselves			1
" mental illness is not curable			1
it is a chronic lifetime illness and it requires a tremendous amount of resources to get them into treatment and to monitor that treatment			0
it is a huge cost to manage that care , " @entity145 said			0
insurers still have to make money , which is difficult with this kind of ongoing , expensive treatment , she said			0
now that the final rules have been announced , @entity31 argues there needs to be " more transparency and means of enforcement			0
or how do you know private insurers will comply ? " friday 's announcement applies to private insurance			1
the rules do not apply to people on @entity176 because the @entity178 administration has already given states guidance on how those plans should be meeting requirements set out by the 2008 law			2
reframing the gun control debate : is mental health the next focus ? the @entity187 setting for @entity1 ' announcement seems particularly appropriate as an acknowledgement of former first lady @entity191 's long efforts to destigmatize mental illness			1
@entity193 is the author of a handful of books on the topic , and the @entity197 was passed in 1980 in large part due to her advocacy			0
the law provided more funding for community - based care and created a system of prevention services and an advocate system for those who struggle with mental illness			1
that law also had a parity provision that was never enforced , @entity1 said @entity193 had told her			1
" finally , in 2013 , we are achieving this , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0

@entity216 was signed into law in 2008 but not enforced
insurance companies often cover mental illness in a more limited fashion than physical illness
@entity1 ' announcement applies only to private insurance
