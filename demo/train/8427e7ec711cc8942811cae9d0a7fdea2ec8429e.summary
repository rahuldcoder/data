@entity0 -- @entity3 's extraordinary climb to the world 's second largest economy was built on the back of @entity3 workers , many of whom left rural farms to migrate for work in coastal factories			1
but as @entity3 's wealth rises , workers are demanding a greater share of the wealth and better access to social services			1
and as this month 's edition of " on @entity3 " examines , the young generation of worker are tech savvy , aware of their rights and choosier about where they go for work			1
" they 're on the @entity27 more ... on especially @entity28 , @entity3 's social media , @entity31 - like thing			1
they 're able to connect with others , see what others are doing , " @entity33 of @entity32 , a @entity0 - based ngo which defends workers ' rights , told @entity1			2
" and in cases where there are strikes or things like that , they can put it out there on @entity28 and other people can learn about it , " he said			0
" they can look online for labor rights and labor contract law			0
" one of the greatest issues for @entity3 's 250 million migrant workers is the " hukou " system of household registration			1
migrant workers often ca n't register in the cities where they work , and subsequently ca n't qualify for social services such as public education or social security			1
" when i talk to migrant workers about a vast array of problems , i think , this usually rises to number one , " @entity63 , a @entity64 correspondent in @entity65 , told @entity1			2
" and i think , for them , the biggest reason this is such a big problem is that they are treated like illegal immigrants inside of their own country			0
" this hits the children of migrant workers			0
" many children are born in these larger cities where their parents have moved to			0
this is their hometown , as far as they know it , " @entity81 said			0
but as @entity3 's coastal provinces -- which were first opened for @entity89 - style economic reform in 1979 -- grow more expensive , more companies are moving factories into rural areas , sparking a new wave of development and giving workers more options closer to home			1
" the companies are looking for cheaper resources , cheaper land , cheaper labor in the home provinces , like in the rural remote provinces in @entity3 , " @entity97 , executive director , @entity98 , told @entity1			1
" in places like @entity106 , the @entity107 , these places have become very expensive			0
so for migrant workers perhaps in the past , you make a salary and then bring it home , because of the cost of living how it 's risen so quickly , it 's no longer viable , " said @entity33			2
" taking a salary that 's a little bit less back near their hometown is a much more attractive option , especially since they can visit their family much more easily			0
" meanwhile , the low - skilled factory jobs in @entity106 are being replaced by higher skilled employment			2
" @entity106 is moving up the value chain , " @entity81 said			0
" a lot of the jobs now that are available at places like @entity127 ( the telecommunications giant ) ... you 're seeing a lot of folks who graduated from ' dazhuang , ' which is the vocational colleges of @entity3 , coming to @entity106 instead of folks who have dropped out of high school perhaps or just come right off the farm			1
" as @entity3 moves from an export - driven , investment - led economy toward domestic consumption growth , the nation depends on the rising buying power of its workforce			1
still , " 400 million people in @entity3 still live on less than $ 2 a day , " @entity81 said			1
" ( @entity3 ) is going to experience slower growth			2
slower growth probably means fewer job , " @entity81 said			0
" i think there are a lot of threats that lie ahead			0
" @entity1 's @entity146 contributed to this article			0
