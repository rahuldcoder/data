so , @entity0 has done something stupid again			1
this time , he made the headlines by allegedly smoking pot on a chartered airplane and being rude and verbally abusive to the crew on a flight to @entity7 in @entity8			1
is he just another rich teen idol blowing off a little testosterone ? sure			0
but seriously , his bad behavior is getting a bit out of control			2
for those who may never have flown aboard a charter , think of it like a bigger , swankier limousine where the passengers in the back are pretty much free to do whatever they want			2
in a regular airplane , the line in the sand is a bit clearer when it comes to passenger conduct			2
unruly behavior is not tolerated on airlines like @entity28 or @entity29			2
get rowdy and obnoxious enough and most captains would tell the passengers they were landing the airplane at the nearest airport if they did n't calm down			0
on the chartered airplane that carried @entity0 , his father and 10 friends , the flight attendant was verbally abused so much so that she took refuge near the cockpit , according to a police report			1
the report also said that the captain asked the @entity0 entourage more than once to stop smoking marijuana , but those demands were ignored			1
worried that the intoxicating fumes would eventually make their way to the cockpit , the pilots donned their emergency oxygen masks			2
luckily , all went well and the airplane landed safely			1
in the great rulebook of flying , this easily qualifies as interference with the flight crew			0
however , even though the plane was met by @entity60 agents and the police upon landing , and the cabin still smelled like marijuana , none of the crew members wanted to press charges			1
who has the resources to sue a pop star who can hire the best lawyer money can buy ? @entity0 got off easy in this incident			1
but it could have been a disaster			0
what if the crew of the chartered jet , trying to be nice to this unruly bunch of well - paying customers , had n't put on the oxygen masks ? what if the fumes had gotten them high before they put on those masks ? instead of a bunch of crazies arguing with the flight crew , you could have a flight crew impaired as well			0
imagine a now - impaired flight crew approaching some of the busiest airspace in the world			0
could they have managed to get the airplane down on the ground in one piece ? maybe			0
but maybe not , because when you 're impaired your thinking is off			0
or , what if one of the passengers , already high as a kite , had wandered up front and distracted the pilots ( chartered planes do n't usually have the same secure doors as airliners ) ... just enough that they missed an important radio call or failed to notice another nearby airplane ? if you were on an airliner headed for @entity109 or @entity110 , how would you feel knowing the guys in some nearby business jet are loopy ? or imagine if the airplane had slid off the runway during landing , or sailed through the airport fence because the crew was n't really in control ? the profit the charter company made carrying the @entity0 entourage would not even cover the attorney 's fees in a lawsuit			1
the flight attendant on the flight said she 'd never fly with these passengers again , and good for her			0
the charter company should never carry the @entity0 entourage again , either , because these people do n't belong in an airplane where they can hurt someone else			1
most captains i know would have put the safety of the crew , the passengers and the people on the ground above everything else			0
should any company fly @entity0 after this ? i hope not , but a wealthy pop star usually gets his way .			1
