@entity0 , @entity1 -- in what is seen as a bow to international pressure to delay implementation of a ban on private security contractors , the @entity1 government said wednesday it will form a committee to plan the phasing out of those contractors without endangering development projects			1
the committee is to be led by @entity1 's minister of interior and will include representatives from @entity16 , the @entity16 - led @entity17 and major international donors			1
it will " develop plans for the disbandment of the @entity22 that provide security for development projects and report on progress to the president , " the @entity1 government said in a written statement			1
it said the phasing out of " illegal " security contractors and road convoy security companies " continues on a priority basis as laid out in the decree			1
" the committee will prepare a timetable for the dissolution of contractors protecting development projects and submit it to president @entity37 by november 15 , the @entity1 government said			1
" once approved , 90 days max will be given to each organization before [ the ] designated dissolution date			0
following the completion of [ the ] plan 's implementation , the government of @entity1 will assume responsibility for providing necessary security for development and reconstruction projects			1
" the committee will examine development and aid companies and develop plans for them to shift to government security , interior minister @entity49 said at a news conference			0
convoys run by private security companies will also have to transition , he said			2
" this is a very serious matter for the government of @entity1 , " @entity58 , @entity59 ambassador to @entity1 , told journalists			2
" this is a fundamental issue for the people of @entity1 , for president @entity37			0
this is about the exercise of sovereignty within this country			0
it 's about the monopoly of the use of force			0
it 's about having the responsibility for and having authority over any armed elements in this country			0
" the announcement was welcomed by the @entity79 , which issued a statement saying it supports the " principled stand " of @entity37 's government regarding the proposed ban			2
" we are committed to implementation of this decree with a fixed timetable and accept that the international community must respond promptly to president @entity37 's long - standing concerns about the conduct of private security companies , " the @entity85 mission said			1
@entity58 said earlier in a statement the @entity59 " strongly endorses " the @entity79 ' position			2
" we will continue to work on a priority basis and in a spirit of partnership with the @entity1 government and international partners to support successful implementation of the decree in a manner that increases @entity1 security , strengthens sovereignty and leadership and ensures the continuous predictable delivery of critical international development assistance , " he said			0
the @entity59 had previously expressed concern about @entity37 's pledge to phase out the country 's 52 private security companies by year 's end , saying that if implemented , the move would leave critical aid personnel unprotected and unable to continue their work			1
the @entity59 has been negotiating with the @entity1 government over such protection , and had been asking for clarification on which contractors would be allowed to remain in the country and under what conditions they could operate			0
earlier this month , the @entity1 government clarified exceptions to the proposed ban , saying that firms offering protection to embassies and foreign diplomats would be allowed to continue to operate			0
the decision " addressed the concerns of @entity16 and foreign embassies regarding the private security companies ' dissolving process , " a statement from @entity37 's office said			1
however , it said that other private security companies not engaged in that work " are a strong threat for the national security and national sovereignty of the country " and that their dissolution would continue as planned .			0
