@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 refugees began arriving in the @entity5 on tuesday , the first wave of what the @entity7 describes as one of the world 's largest resettlement efforts			1
the @entity5 has offered to resettle 60,000 of the estimated 107,000 @entity4 refugees of @entity1 origin now living in seven @entity7 camps in southeastern @entity1 -- their home for the past 17 years			1
six other nations -- @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 -- have offered to resettle 10,000 each			1
" once they arrive , they will be sent to different cities around the @entity5 , " said @entity23 , a spokesman for the @entity24 , which is screening and transporting the refugees			1
the first group , arriving throughout the week , includes 121 refugees			1
they are being sent to @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity32 ; @entity36 , @entity37 ; and other cities , the @entity24 said			1
the @entity7 said several families had arrived in @entity32 as of tuesday , and more are en route to locations in @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			2
so far , however , only about 25,000 of the refugees have registered for resettlement , according to the @entity7 high commissioner for refugees web site , and not many more than 10,000 are expected to leave @entity1 by the end of the year			2
@entity4 , wedged between @entity50 and @entity51 , is a @entity52 kingdom about half the size of the @entity5 state of @entity55			1
it 's considered one of the world 's most isolated countries and the government strictly regulates foreign influences , including tourism , to preserve the country 's @entity52 culture			0
see @entity4 on a map » the country had no electricity , paved roads , cars , telephones or postal service until the 1960s			2
it allowed access to television and the internet only in 1999			0
@entity4 stripped the minority ethnic nepalis of their citizenship and forced them into exile in the early 1990s , allegedly in an attempt to ensure a homogenous culture , according to the independent , nongovernmental group @entity82			1
many of the @entity85 have taken up arms and joined with violent @entity88 rebels , the group said			1
the refugees claim they were forced to leave @entity4 by security forces , but @entity4 has disputed whether all are truly refugees			1
some 15 rounds of talks between @entity1 and @entity4 have failed to resolve the issue			2
the @entity5 ' resettlement plan has divided the refugee community , as members disagree over whether it is best to resettle in the @entity5 or hang onto hopes of returning to @entity4			1
a report posted on the @entity102 web site quotes refugees who have chosen to go to the @entity5			1
" we chose to resettle because there was no other outlet , " said refugee @entity104			0
" talks between @entity1 and @entity4 have produced no results			2
" " everyone says ' @entity5 , @entity5 , @entity5 , ' but i do n't know much about it , " said his wife , @entity109 , according to the @entity7 report			1
" it 's only for the sake of the children that we are ready to go			0
" nearby , the @entity119 family was separating because of its large size			0
three children were leaving first , to be joined by the others later , the report said			0
two of the daughters were crying as they packed their bags , but their mother told them : " why are you crying ? we have nothing here anyway			0
we will join you soon			0
our future will be brighter there			0
" of the 25,000 who have registered for resettlement , more than 12,000 names have been submitted for consideration for host countries , mainly the @entity5 , the @entity102 said			2
more refugees are expected to register after they hear how those in the first group have been integrated into new homes , it said			2
@entity4 became the world 's newest democracy on monday when an election ended more than 100 years of royal rule in the @entity148 nation			0
watch @entity4 line up to vote » officials in @entity4 declared the first elections in the @entity153 kingdom a resounding success			0
officials said 79.4 percent of the country 's 318,465 registered voters went to the polls -- a surprisingly large turnout for a populace that had largely said they preferred to remain under the rule of their revered king			0
but many @entity4 changed their minds after former @entity165 went around the country pitching his case for the elections			0
e-mail to a friend @entity2 's @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
