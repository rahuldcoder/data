-- being @entity1 is n't as simple as it once was			1
seventy - five years ago , when the @entity4 caped -- crusader first appeared on the cover of @entity7 , hoisting a car over his head , he not only stood for truth , justice , and the @entity13 way , he also had a virtual monopoly on the men - in - tights genre			2
lately , though , that field has gotten awfully crowded			0
the local multiplex is lousy with celluloid crime fighters			0
so what turf is left for good old @entity20 ? that 's the nagging question that director @entity23 's @entity22 tries — and ultimately fails — to answer			1
@entity23 , whose best films are 2004 's - adrenalized @entity26 remake and 2007 's hyper - stylized @entity28 saga 300 , has teamed up with producer @entity29 to give us a cooler , more conflicted @entity1			1
but their @entity32 - style makeover never quite comes - together			0
sure , - @entity1 is still faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive ( and thanks to the - impossibly handsome @entity36 , an easy - on - the - eyes slice of spandex - clad beefcake to boot )			1
but he 's been transformed into the latest in a long line of soul - searching super-brooders , trapped between his devastated birth planet of @entity43 and his adopted new home on @entity45			1
he 's just another haunted outsider grappling with issues			1
how high will ' @entity22 ' fly on opening weekend ? at the risk of damning @entity36 with faint praise , the 30 - year - old @entity48 makes a better @entity22 than the milquetoast @entity51 did in 2006 's @entity52			1
but he is n't exactly mr. @entity53 either			0
and i suspect that @entity1 aficionados will be disappointed by just how joyless most of @entity23 's reboot is			1
during a prologue that goes on way too long setting the bloated tone for the film , @entity1 's father @entity58 ( @entity59 ) squares off against @entity64 ( @entity65 ) on @entity43			1
the planet is on the verge of destruction , and @entity58 ships his newborn son off to @entity45 to save him , prompting the maniacal @entity64 to roar about his plans for revenge			0
with its shock - and - awe barrage of sci - fi fire and brimstone , the opening - act salvo should - dazzle and transport us			0
instead , it just gets weighed down by @entity80 overkill and thickets of exposition about a @entity4 codex			0
@entity84 's ' @entity22 ' soundtrack has new surround sound tech things pick up a bit down on @entity45 , where little @entity89 has crash - landed in @entity91 and been raised by the @entity92 ( @entity93 and @entity94 )			2
they 've rechristened him @entity20 , a boy who 's taught to keep his special gifts under wraps - — especially after he saves a busful of classmates and draws the wrong kind of attention			2
@entity36 plays the grown - up @entity20 as a sort of existential loner who drifts from town to town , leaving a series of good deeds in his mysterious wake ... until @entity110 ( @entity111 ) figures out his game			0
the 21st - century @entity110 is n't the gullible gal friday she was in the old comics or the @entity1 films , where she was played by @entity116			1
now she 's a hard - nosed , @entity117 - winning reporter			2
that 's - progress , i guess			2
but there 's a distinct lack of heat between @entity124 and @entity36 , and their stabs at sub-sitcom humor fall flat			2
@entity110 through the years @entity129 's transformation meanwhile , @entity65 's @entity64 huffs and puffs , demanding that the puny earthlings hand over @entity1 , which leads to endless brawls between the two where neither seems able to get hurt			1
i understand that fight scenes like these have become de rigueur centerpieces in comic - book - popcorn extravaganzas , but here they go on forever and have a numbing sameness			0
they 're simply excuses to smash the scenery to bits while @entity84 works up a sweat beating the drums of war on the soundtrack			0
the only moments of real spectacle come when @entity1 learns to fly			1
he rockets through the air like a comet , and it 's thrilling			2
there are n't enough of these gee - whiz - moments of wonder in @entity22			0
never has a race to save the fate of humankind seemed so tedious			0
