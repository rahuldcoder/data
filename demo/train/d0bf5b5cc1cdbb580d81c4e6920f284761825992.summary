-- @entity1 , a lookout for his elite 20 - man @entity4 wildfire - fighting crew , saw sunday 's blaze change directions and warned his team by radio from his hilltop perch			1
the new conditions , he told them , also were forcing him to leave that spot , officials recalled tuesday			2
he did as he was trained , officials said			2
and because he did , @entity1 might have escaped his own death by seconds			1
@entity1 was trying to go to another lookout point when the @entity18 killed 19 members of @entity16 's @entity20 , @entity16 spokesman @entity15 said			1
the incident , part of a fire that has burned more than 8,400 acres since friday , produced the deadliest day for firefighters since the 9/11 attacks			0
" he [ @entity1 ] was doing what he was supposed to do , " @entity15 told @entity0			1
" the crew was doing what they need to do			0
this is why they call this kind of thing an accident			0
" honoring the fallen @entity15 , who confirmed @entity1 's name and job tuesday , said @entity1 is having a hard time dealing with his comrades ' deaths and was n't ready to talk			1
in a statement released through a fire official tuesday , @entity1 said he was grateful for the public 's " outpouring of support towards his organization , " and he asked for privacy for his family and his comrades ' relatives			2
" everyone can appreciate that he 's working though the process of dealing with this loss , and that could last for some time , " said @entity51 , a regional incident commander helping the fire department			0
opinion : when heroes face down fire -- and fate ' his lookout had already burned over ' @entity1 was overlooking his teammates when he told them the " weather was changing rapidly , " and winds moved the fire in a different direction , @entity15 told reporters tuesday			1
@entity15 did n't have particulars , but he said the changes amounted to a " trigger point " -- previously agreed conditions that would require him to go to another spot			0
@entity1 , as prescribed , told the crew he was leaving , and that " he would contact them and they could contact him if they needed anything , " @entity15 said			1
he went down the hill and met a supervisor of a different hotshot crew			2
hotshot crews such as @entity1 's are elite teams that are called to get close to the blaze , dig barriers and clear out the brush and other material that otherwise would fuel it			1
he apparently left just in time			0
" the location that he was at at his lookout had already burned over , " @entity15 said			0
" he got in ( a ) vehicle ( with the other team 's supervisor ) and was taken to a safety zone			0
" perhaps a mile or two away from @entity1 's original location -- @entity15 did n't know sunday 's particulars , but he said that 's typically the distance between lookout and crew -- the fire overcame the 19			1
the deaths are under investigation , but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters , blankets meant to protect against flames and heat , as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them			1
wildfire battle shadowed by losses ' you can not immediately drop somebody in another position ' one @entity119 official , speaking with @entity15 at the news conference in @entity119 tuesday , told reporters that it was protocol to have a hotshot lookout in place at all times			1
the officials there said they did n't know whether another lookout was in place when @entity1 moved			1
either way , @entity15 said , @entity1 " was doing his job and the hotshot crew was doing their job			1
" " you can not immediately drop somebody in another position , " @entity15 said			0
" there are lookouts in the air ... as well as other lookouts			0
he left his post based on protocol , and we was moving to a new position			2
" the @entity119 community has taken the deaths hard			2
many attended a memorial service at the city 's @entity150 campus monday			0
a tribute outside @entity153 grew that day , with flowers , @entity156 flags and signs placed on or near a fence that separated the station from a road			0
the tokens also included 19 bottles of water , arranged in a circle			0
on monday , the @entity119 fire chief also told reporters -- without identifying @entity1 at the time -- that the 20th member was struggling			1
" unfortunately , we have very few words to express that kind of sorrow , but we understood each other , " @entity119 fire chief @entity169 said monday			2
