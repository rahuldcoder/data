-- the midterm elections are a week away			2
control of the @entity3 will be decided by a handful of close contests that remain competitive in the final days			0
in an era of narrow majorities in the upper chamber , just one or two races can make all the difference in terms of who will be in control			2
most experts are predicting that @entity15 will gain the @entity3 , though there are a few outliers , like my colleague at @entity20 , @entity18 , whose statistical models have been showing that @entity22 can still be victorious			1
in the coming days , here are six campaigns to watch			0
in each of these states @entity15 are holding their ground by connecting their opponent to president @entity28 while @entity22 strike back by reminding voters of extremism in the @entity15			1
four of the states have incumbent @entity22 senators who are waging close races for re-election			1
in the other two , the retirements of senators , one a @entity36 and one a @entity15 , have created an opportunity the two parties are contesting			1
@entity39 : this is a @entity3 race that has been extremely expensive , with the national parties pouring money into advertising based on the view that this one can go either way , and it 's close			0
incumbent sen. @entity47 is a @entity36 who voted for president @entity28 's health care program and who has faced a tough challenge from @entity51 , a businessman who pushed back the @entity53 candidate in the @entity15 primary			1
@entity47 , who had been expected to keep this seat , has made some mistakes along the way , such as skipping a @entity59 meeting to raise campaign funds , something that was a no - no in her home state , where the military is a cherished institution			0
superstars from each party have made appearances for the campaign — @entity68 for @entity47 and @entity69 for @entity51 — trying to boost their competitive edge			0
outside groups and the @entity72 are pouring money into @entity51 ' campaign , smelling the potential for a real upset			0
president @entity28 's drive to increase @entity80 - @entity79 turnout is key for the @entity22 strategy			1
@entity15 are continuing to hammer away at @entity47 by criticizing her party for how the @entity83 has handled the @entity85 epidemic and @entity86			1
politics : how the ' war on women ' is changing @entity90 : this is a state that makes @entity22 very nervous			1
a recent poll by a @entity22 company reported that this race is a deadlock , a disappointment to democrats who thought they were safely in the lead			1
their hope was that sen. @entity103 would be able to capitalize on the demographic trends — such as the expanding population of latino - americans — that have been building a solid base for the party , allowing president @entity28 to win in both the 2008 and 2012 elections			1
but recent polls have shown that rep. @entity111 is doing much better than expected , including with female voters			0
this in itself has caused @entity22 great concern , because @entity103 has made his opponent 's position on women 's issues the major focus of his campaign			1
" congressman @entity111 's history of promoting harsh anti-abortion laws , " explained the narrator in one of his ads , " is disturbing			0
" @entity127 : freshmen democrat @entity128 is scrambling to keep his seat			0
from the start , this has been one that was always going to be tough for @entity22 to retain			2
@entity128 barely won in 2008 in this @entity15 state , and he has suffered repeatedly from being connected to president @entity28 's unpopular presidency			1
@entity128 was also accused of allowing a misleading advertisement that suggested attorney general @entity136 had responsibility for a mistake that allowed a sex offender to go free and commit another sex assault and killings			0
right now , @entity136 is enjoying a growing lead			0
@entity143 : even with the @entity146 machine rallying to his side , @entity22 sen. @entity144 has been struggling against @entity15 rep. @entity148 , a veteran and @entity150 graduate who has been hammering away at @entity144 for his ties to president @entity28 , a common theme on the campaign trail			1
a recent article in the @entity155 showed how @entity22 face a number of big demographic challenges in what was once a solid @entity22 state , like the massive growth of population in the conservative exurbs			2
one new poll shows that @entity148 is ahead by 49 % to 41 %			0
@entity144 has also made a number of embarrassing mistakes , including being unable to come up with an answer to a question asked of him during a campaign rally about how the @entity83 was handling @entity85			2
in this state , voter turnout will be absolutely key			0
@entity22 are counting on high levels of spending on ground operations and a surge of @entity79 voters to bring them to victory			2
@entity178 : despite a series of setbacks , such as the leak of a revealing campaign memo , @entity179 has been putting on a strong campaign against businessman @entity185 to capture the seat held by retiring sen. @entity187 , a @entity15			2
@entity22 are going to need @entity178 if they are going to keep control of the @entity3			2
while this election might result in a runoff in january , @entity179 has been doing a good job overcoming the negative sentiment associated with president @entity28 by hitting hard against her opponent 's record in the private sector , using some of the same kinds of attacks that were used against @entity198 on issues like outsourcing			1
@entity185 has struck back by saying that the @entity36 does n't really understand " what it takes to create jobs and create economic value , " which he says he does through his work with the retailer @entity203			0
of course , @entity179 's beloved family name also helps			0
@entity209 : the right - wing state senator @entity210 has rattled the electorate with a controversial campaign that many thought would never work			0
while the @entity15 expunged tea party candidates in most of the primaries , @entity210 was one of the exceptions			2
bidding to take the seat held by retiring sen. @entity218 , a @entity36 , @entity210 turned heads with an ad boasting of her experience castrating hogs , saying she would do the same in @entity226 to cut government spending			0
soldier , @entity232 leader , " reads the sign on her campaign bus			0
@entity22 rep. @entity233 — who has received the support of democrats like @entity28 — is having trouble stopping @entity210 in the polls			1
@entity238 : candidate 's gun remarks should scare us there are a few other races , such as in @entity244 , where the outcome remains uncertain and each party is pouring in as much money and manpower as they can in the final few days to swing states their way			1
election night should be interesting , as we 'll see if @entity22 can somehow defy the historical trend of the party of the @entity83 doing poorly in midterms , or whether @entity15 lock up control of @entity256 and give president @entity28 two more years of gridlock as he finishes his term .			1

the outcome of six races could determine whether the @entity263 remains in @entity22 ' hands
@entity266 : @entity22 citing @entity15 extremism ; @entity15 cite @entity28 's performance
in four of the states , @entity22 incumbents are seeking to win re-election
@entity266 : can @entity83 reverse historical pattern of midterm losses ?
