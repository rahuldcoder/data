what is the transfer window ? the transfer window is a set period of time when football clubs are allowed to buy new players			1
although players ca n't be bought outside the transfer window it does n't stop clubs negotiating transfers before the window opens , with players signing on the dotted line once it does			1
there are two transfer windows per year , one pre-season , and one mid- season , which is open throughout january			0

why does it matter ? the transfer window can see some of football 's biggest stars switch club and it is a period that can determine how a team will fare during the season ahead			1
it is a chance for coaches to rebuild and reinforce their squads , and a time when clubs can see their key players depart for greener pastures and bigger wage packets			2
when a club is active in the transfer window , making big name buys , it can be taken as a statement of intent for the following season			1
just watch @entity42 club @entity12 bring in star players in an attempt to make up the distance between them and arch - rivals @entity77			2

movers and shakers this summer 's transfer window is likely to be dominated by one club -- @entity12			1
their newly elected club president , billionaire construction magnate @entity100 , previously headed the club between 2000 and 2006 , when his policy was to bring football 's biggest names to @entity12			2
the " @entity111 " brought to @entity12 by @entity100 included the likes of @entity106 , @entity107 , the @entity109 ronaldo and @entity110			0
now @entity100 is back in charge and seems intent on reviving his " @entity111 " policy , rsigning former @entity114 before smashing the world transfer record to spay $ 130 million for @entity11 's @entity10			0
@entity12 have also been linked with @entity117 's @entity39 winger @entity116 , @entity119 midfielder @entity118 and @entity121 winger @entity120 but @entity12 wo n't have it all their own way , facing competition from the likes of @entity126			1
