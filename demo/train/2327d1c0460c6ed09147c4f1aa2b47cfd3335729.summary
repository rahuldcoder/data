@entity0 -- six months ago , a @entity3 convenience store owner turned a would - be robbery into an act of compassion			2
on wednesday , the shoplifter made amends with a $ 50 bill and a thank you letter for saving him from a life of crime			1
the story began in may 2009 , when @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity0 , was closing his @entity19 convenience store one night			2
security camera footage from that evening shows a man wielding a baseball bat barging into the store and demanding money			2

unbeknownst to the man , @entity16 never loads his gun			1
according to @entity16 , the man immediately started to plead with him , tearfully saying , " i 'm sorry , i have no food			1
my whole family is hungry			0
do n't call the police			0
" " when i see him starting crying [ those ] things , i really feel bad for him , " said @entity16			2
" i say , oh man , this is something different			0
" @entity16 made the man pledge never to rob anybody ever again , then gave the man $ 40 and a loaf bread			1
@entity16 , who is from @entity47 , said the man then wanted to be a @entity49 like him , so he recited an @entity51 oath and gave the would - be robber the name @entity54			1
@entity16 went to get some milk , but when he returned the man had fled with the money and food			1
both @entity16 and @entity59 have no idea who the man is			1
after the may incident , @entity16 explained that he will " absolutely not " be pressing charges , though police are still investigating the case			2
over the past six months , @entity16 's story of sympathy and kindness has inspired many across the country			1

" no person has ever moved my spirit the way you did			0
from your biggest admirer , " one letter says			0
" great men are capable of great acts			0

he has made a point to give this money " to the people " by offering free bagels , rolls and coffee in his store every night after 9 o'clock			0
but the envelope that arrived on wednesday came as a surprise			0
postmarked november 11 without a return address , it enclosed a $ 50 bill and a note apparently from the would - be robber			1
the typed letter begins , " @entity105 ( sic ) , " and goes on to say that the man is sorry for his actions six months ago			1
" at the time i had no money no food on my table no job , and nothing for my family			1
i know that it was wrong , but i had know ( sic ) choice			0
i needed to feed my family			2
when you had that gun to my head i was 100 % that i was going to die , " reads the letter			2
the letter says @entity16 's acts inspired him to become a " @entity49 " and that his life has changed dramatically			1
" i 'm very happy that somebody got to change his life , " @entity16 said			1
" if he is a maybe criminal , maybe is not anymore			0
so now he is a good person in this community and i 'm very glad for that			0
