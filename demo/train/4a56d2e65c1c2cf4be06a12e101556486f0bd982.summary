two @entity1 aviation design studios are betting on gambling in the air			1
@entity3 of @entity4 and @entity5 , the founder of @entity6 , have teamed up to create the @entity7 , a luxe bar - cum - casino they hope will one day become standard on long - haul commercial flights			1
the @entity7 features trendy seating , a drinks area and a blackjack table			2
" we 're trying to bring back the glamor of the ' 50s and ' 60s a little bit ; the kind you see in the @entity19 movies , " says @entity5			0
the concept is relatively new ( launched last october ) , so as of now , @entity5 and @entity3 are still in talks with various airlines			0
the idea of in - flight gambling may seem like a new one , principally because no airline is currently doing it			1
but in reality , the concept has been around for decades			0
@entity28 took gambling up in the air in 1981 , when they installed lightweight slot machines in the aisles on a flight that operated between @entity33 and @entity34			1
it was an experiment that lasted a mere two months			1
the company admits the machines posed " an operational challenge " , and had them removed			1
see also : in - flight internet taking off in the 1990s , @entity40 installed gambling software that allowed passengers to bet up to $ 350 on a variety of casino classics , including poker , keno and blackjack			1
it seemed other carriers were going to follow suit , that is , until a @entity40 plane crashed in 1998			0
air crash investigators implicated a failure of the jet 's in - flight entertainment system as a reason for the disaster			1
however , the idea of in - flight gambling re-emerged a few years ago			1
@entity61 tycoon @entity60 announced in 2005 that a handful of recently purchased @entity64 planes would include double beds and in - flight casinos			1
" you 'll have two ways to get lucky on a @entity61 flight , " he joked with the @entity67			1
the company seems to have backtracked since then			2
" @entity74 were just an idea , along with many other ideas we talked about a few years ago , " a @entity61 spokesman told @entity73			1
" truthfully , we did not really get any further with it			0
" they declined to comment as to why they did n't ultimately implement casinos on their @entity82			2
@entity83 announced in 2004 that it would introduce gambling through an in - flight entertainment system , though this too has yet to come to fruition			1
@entity83 's head of communications , @entity86 , said the company still hopes to do so in the future			1
" we do n't have the technology in place at the moment , but hopefully we will in the next two or three years , " he says			0
" really , the reason we do n't currently is based on the expense of the @entity96 technology that would be required for it			0
we 're waiting for the price to come down			0
" see also : @entity83 considers serving in - flight porn aside from the initial investment , there are several other barriers to introducing casinos on airplanes			1
for starters , as more carriers are unrolling @entity96 on their flights , passengers could feasibly just gamble online from their mobile devices			0
one wonders if this would n't defeat the purpose of airlines investing in their own gaming systems			0
@entity86 says that @entity83 plans to combat the issue by ultimately offering " closed loop " @entity96 , so that passengers will have to go through the airline 's own system to gamble			1
@entity5 and @entity3 also do n't see online gambling as competition to their own concept			2
" when you 're gambling on your screen , or on your phone , you 're still cramped with other people			2
if you get out of your seat and enter another space with your friends and colleagues , it gives you a completely different experience , " notes @entity3			0
" when you 're on a 14 - hour flight , even when you 're in business class , all you can really do is eat , drink , watch movies and sleep			2
the @entity7 is n't just a bar or entertainment idea			2
we see it as a social space			0
" it 's difficult to imagine that airlines would be willing to give over potential passenger space ( and the fares that come with it ) to a social arena , but @entity3 says if designed properly , there should n't be a conflict			0
see also : in - flight phone calls to become standard , experts say " most big aircrafts have crew rest areas and lavatories in the cargo area down below			2
the space could be easily rearranged to include a social space , without representing a loss of revenue , " he says			0
the biggest obstacle to in - flight gambling , however , is a legal one			1
since 1994 , gambling has been prohibited in @entity168 airspace			2
still , @entity5 believes that this might change in the future			0
" a few years ago , it was forbidden to play games for money on the internet			0
it was not open then , but now you can play online			0
a lot of things are changing			0
