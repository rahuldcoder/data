-- take it from president @entity2 -- @entity4 's @entity3 is a must - win swing district in a must - win swing state			1
" we won last time in @entity3 , and if we win again , we win @entity4 , " @entity2 declared at a rally in august			1
" and if we win @entity4 , we win the election			1
" the final factor affecting many undecided voters in this wealthy @entity13 exurb is sequestration -- massive , automatic cuts scheduled to start taking effect at the the beginning of 2013 after the failure of a supercommittee to come up with a deficit - reduction plan			1
@entity3 is emblematic of the new northern @entity4 -- upper - middle class , fast - growing and increasingly diverse			1
over the past decade , the landscape has transformed from quiet farmland to rows of upper middle - class houses			1
as defense budgets boomed under president @entity27 post- 9/11 , the industry expanded , and many new defense workers and contractors moved to @entity3			2
the county now has the highest median household income in the @entity33 -- $ 119,000 a year			0
@entity34 doubled over the past decade , to 312,000 -- and the @entity36 population has tripled			0
this is n't old @entity4 ; it 's new @entity4			1
and these demographic factors helped @entity2 become the first @entity40 to win the state since @entity42 in 1964 -- by a margin in @entity3 of just 11,509 votes			1
four years later , the unemployment rate in @entity3 is strikingly low -- just 4 % -- about half the national average			2
but these looming automatic cuts are creating a clear and present danger to @entity3 's economic well - being that is resonating here			1
news : energized @entity2 touts new jobs report in @entity4 , @entity52 so sequestration weighs heavily on the minds of undecided @entity3 voters such as @entity56 , co-founder of a 2 - year - old small business -- @entity58 -- that specializes in consulting to government agencies to increase efficiency			1
@entity56 is a coveted swing voter whose votes in the past reflect the winner of @entity4 -- the voter that both campaigns are trying to reach in this final stretch			1
he 's a native @entity4 , raised in @entity69 , and he cast his first ballot for @entity71			1
the first @entity40 he ever voted for was @entity2			1
four years later , he 's concerned that @entity2 's run out of energy and the overall economy still has n't improved as fast as he 'd hoped			2
he understands that the deficit needs to be dealt with but believes that abrupt sequester - style cuts could be devastating to the local and national economy			2
he 'll be watching the next debates with these priorities in mind : " i feel passionate about health care , that 's for sure			0
and the issues around the federal government spending , the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , and how it affects our business			0
it is my lifeblood and my future			0
" there 's no question that the specter of sequestration has cast a chill in this community			2
" my neighborhood is full of subcontractors and contractors that work for or in the federal government , " @entity56 says			0
" some have already talked to their employees -- they have given notice that a storm could be coming , and they need to be prepared for layoffs			0
" @entity56 's business partner is @entity106 , a former captain in the @entity107 , an independent voter who also serves on the @entity109 " this is going to be as serious a problem to our north @entity4 region as the fallout of the car industry was to @entity116 , " @entity106 says			2
" it will be small businesses like ours that are going to be hit the most			0
two million jobs will be lost , half of which will be from small companies			0
we 'll be hit earliest and hardest			0
" @entity106 blames sequestration on congressional division and dysfunction : " it 's as if there are certain factions within the parties who are setting things up where because of the pressure of the next primary , because of the pressure of the election , there 's no incentive for compromise and collaboration to find meaningful solutions to complex problems			2
" there 's plenty of blame to go around for both parties , but @entity106 expresses special frustration with a particular group : " those who oppose @entity2 have done everything in their power to ensure that he fails			2
" with sequestration as a final factor in this key swing county of @entity4 , the @entity155 rhetoric of 2010 wo n't necessarily work on undecided swing voters such as @entity56			1
" people support the government here , " he says			0
" they work for the mission of the government			0
even as a contractor , you work to fulfill that mission			0
" news : with @entity170 by his side , @entity168 rallies @entity171 in debate victory lap @entity171 have a contrarian streak -- in recent decades they have voted for a governor from the opposite party as the president just elected			0
" virginians are wary of too much government power in one party , " says @entity178 mayor @entity177			0
" they like the balance of power			0
" but while both parties might be to blame for the failed supercommittee resulting in the scheduled sequestration cuts , they can vote for only one president			2
the demographic changes in @entity4 and comparatively strong economy might give @entity2 reason to believe that he can make history a second time by winning @entity4 , but it is far from a sure thing in this traditionally conservative corner of the country			1
to convince @entity56 and other undecided swing voters in @entity3 , the two candidates will need to present a balanced plan to avoid the blunt edge of sequestration cuts and a practical strategy for avoiding this kind of high - risk , hyper - partisan brinksmanship in the future			1
that 's a final factor in winning this key swing district of this key swing state in the fight for the @entity211 2012			1
