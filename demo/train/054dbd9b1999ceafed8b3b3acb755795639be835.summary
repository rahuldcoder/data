the failure of @entity0 's main center - right party to form a coalition government monday added yet more uncertainty to the debt - ridden country 's political situation			1

the debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc , where fears that @entity0 might collapse had increased pressure on other debt - laden nations such as @entity209 and @entity210			2
the tribulations of @entity39 and @entity37 were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also - rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago , propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures			2
