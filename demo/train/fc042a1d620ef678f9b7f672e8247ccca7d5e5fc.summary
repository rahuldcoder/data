-- the attorney for an @entity6 diplomat whose arrest and detention in @entity4 sparked an international controversy on visa fraud charges said thursday the allegations are baseless			1
and he accused @entity11 authorities of deliberately mishandling her arrest			1
" they were trying to humiliate her and flex their muscle , and they succeeded in doing that , " @entity14 , lawyer for @entity15 , told @entity0 's " @entity22			1
" but the attorney for a housekeeper at the center of allegations that @entity15 violated an agreement in a visa document by underpaying her said @entity14 is the one who does n't have the facts straight			1
the salvos came a day after the chief federal prosecutor in @entity32 , @entity11 attorney @entity33 , lashed out at those questioning the legitimacy of the case , which has infuriated @entity6 society and led to repercussions from the @entity6 government			1
" this office 's sole motivation in this case , as in all cases , is to uphold the rule of law , protect victims , and hold accountable anyone who breaks the law -- no matter what their societal status and no matter how powerful , rich or connected they are , " he said in a statement			2
@entity15 , @entity6 's deputy consul general in @entity4 , was arrested and stripped - searched last week on charges of visa fraud related to her treatment of her housekeeper , who has been publicly identified as @entity57			1
" this type of fraud on the @entity11 and exploitation of an individual will not be tolerated , " @entity33 said			1
the case has sparked outrage among different , conflicting camps : those slamming her treatment as " barbaric " and those saying the real issue is the alleged mistreatment of domestic workers			0
the case has reverberated in @entity72 and @entity73			0
@entity6 prime minister @entity74 called her treatment " deplorable			1
" in a statement , secretary of state @entity76 expressed " regret " over the situation , without saying the @entity11 had done anything wrong			1
" in terms of our relationship with the @entity11 , i do feel this must be resolved , " @entity6 external affairs minister @entity81 said , according to @entity0 sister network @entity82			1
deputy secretary of state @entity87 and undersecretary @entity88 sought to diffuse tensions through discussions with @entity6 officials			1
a senior official said the @entity11 government is most concerned about @entity6 's response in removing security barriers at the embassy in @entity73 and whether @entity6 might subject a @entity11 diplomat to treatment similar to what @entity15 went through during her detention in @entity4			1
in court documents and in a public statement , @entity33 -- who was himself born in @entity6 -- states that @entity15 lied in a visa application , promising to pay her housekeeper the minimum wage of $ 9.75			1
she would actually be paid $ 3.31 per hour			0
@entity15 allegedly instructed the housekeeper to say she would be paid the higher rate and not mention her actual pay			2
@entity15 allegedly had the housekeeper sign another employment contract establishing the lower pay			2
the second contract , which was not to be revealed to the @entity11 government , " deleted the required language protecting the victim from other forms of exploitation and abuse " and also deleted language that said @entity15 agreed to abide by @entity11 laws , @entity33 said wednesday			1
@entity15 is charged with one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements , which carry a combined maximum sentence of 15 years in prison			0
the allegations have " nothing to do with what the actual facts are , " @entity14 told @entity0 thursday			2
khobragade abided by the terms of the contract that was submitted , he said			0
" there was no fraud			0
" the second contract , @entity14 alleged , was one the domestic worker requested , " which would confirm that a portion of the money that she was going to get paid would get sent directly to her husband in @entity73			0
and that 's what happened			2
and that 's what the documents support			0
" but @entity144 , the housekeeper 's attorney , said his client was only paid the smaller amount , which was deposited into an @entity6 bank account			1
her client denies being given any money in the @entity11 that could be considered a salary , she said			2
" i do n't know what he 's talking about , " @entity144 said of @entity14 's claims			0
" this story seems to keep changing			2
" @entity6 diplomat : does she have immunity ? dispute over diplomat 's treatment @entity11 authorities should have handled the case differently , @entity14 argued			1
a financial dispute could be handled as a civil action , he said			0
and he asked why the government did n't contact @entity15 to say she would be arrested and give her the chance to come in			0
" we do self - surrenders all the time with defendants in @entity4 , " @entity14 said			0
instead , she was arrested after dropping off her daughter at school			0
" this is muscle flexing , " @entity14 complained			0
the diplomat 's detention was handled by the @entity178 , not @entity4 police			1
@entity33 defended the handling of the arrest and custody though his office was not involved			0
" @entity15 was accorded courtesies well beyond what other defendants , most of whom are @entity11 citizens , are accorded , " he said wednesday			2
" she was not , as has been incorrectly reported , arrested in front of her children			0
the agents arrested her in the most discreet way possible , and unlike most defendants , she was not then handcuffed or restrained			0
" in addition , she was allowed to keep her phone and make calls to arrange personal matters , including child care , he said			0
" because it was cold outside , the agents let her make those calls from their car and even brought her coffee and offered to get her food			0
it is true that she was fully searched by a female deputy marshal -- in a private setting -- when she was brought into the @entity178 ' custody , but this is standard practice for every defendant , rich or poor , @entity11 or not , in order to make sure that no prisoner keeps anything on his person that could harm anyone , including himself			2
this is in the interests of everyone 's safety			0
" there can be no plausible claim that this case was somehow unexpected or an injustice , " @entity33 said			0
" in fact , the @entity6 government itself has been aware of this legal issue , and that its diplomats and consular officers were at risk of violating the law			2
the question then may be asked : is it for @entity11 prosecutors to look the other way , ignore the law and the civil rights of victims ... or is it the responsibility of the diplomats and consular officers and their government to make sure the law is observed ? " one aspect of this case that 's in dispute involves the question of what level of immunity @entity15 is entitled to , the circumstances of her arrest and @entity251 's actions during her employment			1
opinion : what about the nanny ? calls for an apology it remained unclear thursday whether @entity11 and @entity6 officials would be able to find a way out of the diplomatic tangle			1
@entity76 's expression of regret was featured prominently on the front page of leading @entity6 newspapers on thursday			1
commentators and government officials debated whether his comments went far enough			0
" an apology from @entity11 , acceptance of their fault is what we will be satisfied with , " parliamentary affairs minister @entity269 said , according to @entity82			1
as her case plays out in public , @entity15 has been moved to @entity6 's @entity279 to the @entity280 , where she may get full diplomatic immunity , @entity6 officials say			1
@entity251 , meanwhile , has no passport , is living with friends and has been granted temporary legal status that allows her to remain and work in the @entity11 until the matter is resolved , her lawyer @entity144 said			2
human rights advocates say the allegations against @entity15 highlight the exploitation of domestic workers around the world			0
" it 's a good sign that authorities are showing they can take mistreatment of domestic workers seriously , " @entity292 of @entity293 said in a blog post tuesday			2
" it sends the message that no employer is above the law			0
" debate : arrest , strip - search of @entity6 diplomat ' barbaric ? ' @entity0 's @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report .			1
