-- there is no title in football that hangs heavier on the shoulders of a young player than that of teenage prodigy			2
a spell at @entity9 could help @entity10 adjust to the pressures of @entity13 football			1
those who can carry it -- @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 -- go on to become the greatest players in the game			0
those who ca n't fade into obscurity -- @entity24 anyone ? the jury is still out on whether @entity10 -- like @entity26 - born -- will fall into the first category or the second , but the footballing world should soon be a little closer to finding out after the 18 - year - old 's move this week from the shallow waters of @entity32 and the @entity33 to @entity9 of @entity34			1
@entity10 , who moved to the @entity35 as a child and has @entity35 citizenship , already has three seasons under his belt in the @entity33 , having made his professional debut at 14			1
as an @entity33 player his progress has been steady if unspectacular for a player inevitably compared to the incomparable @entity16			0
indeed , in the eyes of some -- unfairly -- @entity10 has already failed to live up to the expectations placed on him			0
in 2003 an @entity33 coach told @entity48 , shortly before @entity10 signed a $ 1 million contract with @entity50 , that @entity10 would start for the @entity35 at the 2006 @entity51			1
to date he has just a solitary international cap to his name			0
" @entity10 , when we signed him , was one of most talented young players in the world			0
i think , today , he still is one of most young talented players in the world , " says @entity33 deputy commissioner @entity57			0
" what we 've struggled with is the expectations , not that we 've placed on him , but that the media has placed on him			0
" for a player feted as a future major world star though , @entity9 is perhaps not the destination those who had mapped out his career along the lines of the @entity70 soccer trilogy " goal " would have chosen			2
the @entity73 club may be one of @entity13 football 's greatest names , but it is a long time -- just one @entity79 title in 13 years -- since they were one of the @entity81 's great teams and @entity10 had previously been linked with the likes of @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 or @entity86 yet by favoring @entity9 over bigger clubs , @entity10 's advisors have actually made a smart move			1
moving to @entity34 will give the teenager a chance to acclimatise to the higher standards and tougher expectations of @entity13 football away from the high - pressure atmosphere of one of the continent 's true giants			1
@entity10 is also following a well - worn path for @entity101 youngsters			2
@entity19 first signed for @entity102 when he first left @entity103 , while @entity18 originally settled at @entity105 side @entity104			0
both subsequently moved onto greatness at @entity107 ; @entity35 soccer fans will be willing @entity10 to make a similar leap upwards from @entity9 sooner rather than later			1

@entity35 soccer prodigy @entity10 signs for @entity79 side @entity9
@entity115 - born @entity10 hailed as *saviour* of @entity35 soccer since age of 13
had been linked with bigger clubs *including* @entity85 , @entity83
move to *lesser* club could help the 18 - year - old adapt to @entity13 football
