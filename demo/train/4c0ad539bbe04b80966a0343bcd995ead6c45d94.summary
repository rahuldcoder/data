-- many people fail to have great careers because they make excuses to avoid taking action			1
they dismiss the importance of passion to great careers by claiming that passionate people are abnormal			1
by contrast , in most people 's eyes , those who are normal only need to work hard and they will have at least a good career			1
but good jobs are disappearing , as bad and great jobs squeeze out the middle range			1
hard work alone buys little advantage			2
the most common excuse is to use the importance of family and personal relationships as the reason to avoid the demands of a great career			1
but how can you be a great spouse , parent or friend by denying your true identity ? without passion , no one can fully express their talent or define who they are			1
@entity35 : keep your goals to yourself since pursuing your passion is a necessary -- but not sufficient -- condition for a great career , it becomes logically essential to find your passion as a starting point			1
nevertheless , many people struggle to find their passions			1
what mistakes are they making ? often they assume that finding one 's passion is a matter of luck			2
they see that some people found their passions as children			1
often others seem to just trip over their passion as they move into adulthood			2
the process seems random and difficult to view as a methodical process of search			2
yes , some are lucky			2
they have the luck of being born into a family in which a family member or friend shows them a domain that immediately engages them , or one that slowly sneaks up on them			1
in the absence of the lucky circumstance of their family , the search would have been longer and more challenging			1
@entity35 : a kinder , gentler philosophy of success but notice that some who pursue a childhood or family " interest " do so only as a convenient default choice			1
it was there and so they chose it to avoid further thought or uncertainty			2
it is hardly an interest , although they may speak of it very positively -- the better to tell themselves or others that they made a " wise " choice			0
the majority of us do not have the advantage of circumstance , and therefore have no choice but to search for our passion			0
many people fail to find their passion because they either fail to search methodically or search persistently			1
some will simply not commit the time and energy to a search that can often be frustrating			0
in fact , they want their " destiny " to find them ; they do not want to find it themselves			1
you can not find your passion idly staring into space , hoping for it to appear as a revelation , from one book , article , blog posting or casual conversation			1
@entity35 : 4 lessons from robots about being human those who search and find their passion place themselves in intensely stimulating environments , and stay there until the job is done			1
it can be intellectually exhausting			0
there are many such environments			0
some read voraciously ; others seek out many people in many situations and engage them in intense conversation			1
others visit every major museum and gallery in @entity145			0
they find their passion by immersing themselves in human experience			1
but you can not just read , talk or experience			0
you must also have your mind in high gear			0
you must be fully engaged , reading and thinking to a purpose			0
you must be constantly saying to yourself about whatever book , fact , argument , person or experience is at hand : why ? what if ? why do n't they ? yes , it is intense			0
and yes , too few are practiced in this art , no matter their level of education			0
but you will never find your passion in the modern way : by surfing or browsing			1
recognize the superficiality implied by those words and by our impatient , thoughtless world			0
you will have to stand against the popular culture to find your passion			2
too many do not have the independence of mind or force of commitment to do so			0
@entity35 : inventing is the easy part take the time you need			0
recognize your mind 's natural tendency to resolve its painful uncertainty by rushing to judgment , even to the judgment that it is time to give up			0
how will you recognize your passion when you encounter it ? usually , it is quite easy			0
one moment you are reading in hopes of finding a topic of great interest ; then you find that you are reading and do not want to stop			1
or you find yourself in a regular conversation , and you start talking with excitement about an idea			2
or you find yourself in an activity and you lose track of time itself			2
the rule of passion is simple : the mind can not stop thinking about that which it loves			0
your passion is what you would do even if you won the lottery			0
even with a passion identified , there is a common pitfall			0
some people find their passion , and then relying on no more than popular opinion , they dismiss the passion as one that " can not be turned into a livelihood			1
" and they move on to try to find a second , more practical love			2
that is not necessarily a bad choice since one could certainly have more than one love			0
but before you look for a second love , you should creatively examine whether your first found love could support a career			0
research the experiences of those who have found ways to pursue such livelihoods			0
never take conventional wisdom as anything other than folklore , to be tested against your logic and experiences			0
remember that passion is necessary for a great career , but it is not sufficient			2
there 's no magic here			0
success also demands persistence , focus , discipline , independence of mind , resourcefulness , experimentation and high creativity			1
