-- just weeks after the scandal about pictures of @entity5 's @entity4 naked in @entity6 , a magazine has sparked fresh controversy by publishing pictures of prince @entity10 's wife , @entity9 , topless while vacationing			1
the duchess of @entity12 is " upset " with the magazine -- a @entity14 publication called @entity15 , a royal source told @entity0			2
palace officials , threatening legal action , have blasted what they call a " grotesque " invasion of privacy			1
the grainy pictures appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the couple was staying at a private chateau in @entity26 , in southern @entity14			1
they were " hugely saddened to learn that a @entity14 publication and a photographer have invaded their privacy in such a grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner , " a @entity28 spokesman said			1
these new privacy controversies have dredged up the royal family 's often rocky relationship with the press and put a spotlight on how the palace deals with the media after the tragic death of @entity10 's mother , @entity43 , as she fled photographers in @entity45 15 years ago			1
" the incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of @entity43 , and all the more upsetting to @entity52 and @entity53 for being so , " the palace spokesman said			2
" @entity54 had every expectation of privacy in the remote house			2
it is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs , let alone publish them			1
" @entity10 , @entity9 on high - stakes mission @entity28 officials told @entity0 they " believe a red line has been crossed			1
" the palace confirmed that the couple is taking legal action against the publishers of @entity15			2
the pair remain focused on their @entity71 tour on behalf of @entity73 , he added			0
@entity10 , who is second in line to the throne , and his wife are in @entity77 as they carry out a nine - day @entity71 tour of @entity81 nations , which started in @entity82			1
the photographs can not be accessed on @entity15 's website , which shows only the magazine 's front cover with heavily blurred images			1
the photos are featured in the magazine 's print copy , which is available in @entity14			2
read more about the duchess of @entity12 the latest furor comes three weeks after the @entity5 royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of @entity10 's younger brother , prince @entity4 , partying naked in his @entity6 hotel room with a group of girls			1
those photographs were widely circulated online but were published in only one @entity5 tabloid , @entity101 , after palace officials asked @entity5 media not to run them			1
the @entity104 , the @entity5 press watchdog , received about 3,800 complaints from the public but said it was inappropriate for it to take any action without a formal complaint from the palace			2
the @entity101 has made clear that it wo n't publish the pictures of @entity9 , however			1
editor @entity112 tweeted : " @entity101 has no intention of breaching the royal couple 's privacy			1
the circumstances are very different to those relating to the photos of @entity4 in @entity6			0
" @entity119 , editor - in - chief of @entity15 in @entity14 , posted several comments on @entity121 late thursday promoting the release of the topless pictures of @entity9			1
one said : " the world exclusive of # closer tomorrow is @entity125 as you have never seen her ... and as you will never see her again			2
" another read : " for kate middleton to have tan lines she would have to be wearing a swimsuit ! " interviewed by @entity0 affiliate @entity132 on friday , @entity119 defended the decision to publish the photographs , saying , " we were just doing our job			1
" the magazine was tipped off about the dates of the royal couple 's visit to @entity26 and sent a photographer , she said			2
the pair were visible on a terrace from the road			0
opinion : @entity5 privacy should start with @entity5 press @entity119 said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos and that she believes they are not degrading , as " they are just like any other couple in love			1
" she described the reaction to the pictures ' publication as " disproportionate " and slammed the @entity5 press as " complete hypocrites , " since photos of @entity4 naked were published by the @entity101 @entity119 said that there are additional photos that are even more revealing but that @entity15 is not publishing them for now			0
the magazine will wait to see if any complaint is made against it , she said			2
" i think that what these photos really highlight is the issue of the royal couple 's security , " she added			0
a string of negative comments from members of the public has already been posted on the @entity167 's facebook page			0
one , written in @entity14 , said : " your behavior is unacceptable , you 're as bad as the @entity184 tabloids			0
you have gone too far with the photos of @entity186 and it will cost you a lot i hope			0
" it is not yet clear what form any legal action by @entity10 and @entity9 against closer magazine , run by an @entity194 business called @entity195 , might take			1
but @entity5 lawyer @entity196 said the magazine 's decision to publish was a clear breach of @entity14 legal codes and was out of line with current views on people 's right to privacy			1
" the perception of the @entity14 was that they are less aggressive , that they have a culturally different opinion of where privacy laws should lie			2
here they appear to have gone right over the other way , " she said			0
@entity14 law provides for " draconian sanctions " to protect against this kind of behavior , she said , including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines			2
but even if distribution of the images is contained , @entity223 said , the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge			0
@entity14 magazine @entity231 was fined 2,000 euros ( $ 2,580 ) last week after it published a photo of @entity234 , partner of @entity14 president @entity235 , in a bikini on its front cover , @entity132 reports			2
@entity234 is also taking legal action against other @entity14 magazines that published images of her and @entity235 in swimwear while on vacation , @entity132 says			0
@entity82 gives royal welcome to @entity10 , @entity125 the latest royal controversy threatens to overshadow what has until now been a well - received tour in @entity248 , undertaken as part of diamond jubilee celebrations for the queen , @entity10 's grandmother			1
the duchess of @entity12 gave her first public speech in @entity77 's capital , @entity255 , on thursday , at a hospice for terminally ill children and adults			0
she is the patron of a charity supporting children 's hospices in @entity262 , @entity184			0
the royal couple will be in @entity77 until sunday before heading to the @entity264 and @entity265			0
the duchess was very conservatively dressed as she visited a mosque in @entity255 on friday			0
there was also a security scare when a man lunged at @entity9 and tried to give her a flower as she and @entity10 left a festival of @entity77 dancing in a park in the capital			1
a man was arrested over the incident , a palace source said			0
" @entity53 was getting into the car and the @entity52 was walking round to the other side of the car when an enthusiastic member of the public tried to give her a flower , " he told @entity0			0
" he was very close , right up against the car			0
he was arrested by local police officers			0
royal protection officers were not involved , though they had noticed him in the crowd earlier on			0
the @entity52 and @entity53 were not in any danger at all at any point			0
" the @entity14 closer magazine is run by a different company from the publication of the same name in the @entity5			1
closer @entity5 , published by @entity295 , issued a statement distancing itself from the @entity14 magazine			1
" @entity167 @entity5 would like to make it clear that the two publications make entirely independent editorial decisions			0
in this respect the comments made by the editor of the @entity14 edition which have reported in the media today do not reflect the opinions of @entity167 @entity5			0
" closer magazine @entity5 was not offered any pictures of this nature and certainly has no intention of publishing the photographs of the @entity125 which have been published in @entity14 this morning			1
" the @entity5 media is under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses			0
the conclusions of an independent judge - led inquiry , which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms , are expected by the end of the year			0
more : what awaits @entity10 , @entity125 on the royal tour ? @entity0 's @entity325 and @entity326 contributed to this report .			1
