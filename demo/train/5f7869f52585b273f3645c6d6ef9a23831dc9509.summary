@entity0 -- briefly back in @entity3 doing his day job , @entity2 met with high school students outside his office			1
true to form , he signed copies of the @entity8 and wryly told them with a chuckle , " no one around here reads it very much			0
i 'd like to get everybody to read it			0
" @entity2 made a detour from the presidential campaign trail to @entity17 on wednesday in order to cast a vote to protest raising the debt limit			1
" we are in denial here in @entity3 , " @entity2 said on the @entity22 floor			2
" if we had the vaguest idea of how serious this crisis is financially , not only for us but for the world , we would cut spending			0
" the busy @entity32 @entity31 lawmaker seemed to cram in as much as he could to push his libertarian agenda -- even introducing legislation to repeal indefinite detention of terror suspects he calls unconstitutional			2
@entity2 running fourth in latest @entity39 poll what @entity2 did not do was attend a closed - door gathering of @entity22 republicans			1
in fact , the @entity31 presidential contender is known to never attend these meetings			1
but @entity2 's @entity31 colleagues who did go had no shortage of opinions about his strong showing in the presidential race so far			1
" you 've got to admire an individual who , despite the currents of the time -- polling data -- says what he believes in and sticks to it			0
@entity2 does that , " said rep. @entity59 , @entity60 , who has served with @entity2 for years			2
" the public understands we have too many @entity64 and @entity65 wanting to make a deal or ' the price is right ' in @entity0 , and they 're yearning for leadership -- people who take a position and stick to it , " @entity59 said			0
rep. @entity72 , @entity2 's fellow @entity32 , said he disagrees with @entity73 on many issues but is n't surprised about his success in these tough economic times			1
" he 's been so consistent over the years			0
he feels very strongly about limited government , about personal responsibility and individual freedoms , and staying consistent has drawn a good , solid base for him in this presidential campaign , " @entity72 said			2
other @entity83 were less positive about @entity2 's ascent			1
" i do n't have any personal dislike for the man , but i will say to you that he has really been essentially totally ineffective in @entity3 , " said rep. @entity85 , @entity86			0
@entity85 , who has endorsed @entity90 , called @entity2 a " nonplayer " on @entity17			2
" that 's why most of his supporters support him , but what they do n't realize is that most of the things he puts forward are only for the consumption of the public , " @entity85 said			2
from government spending to military action abroad , @entity2 has spent decades building a reputation that earned him a nickname inside the @entity31 leadership : doctor no. " he voted no on absolutely everything , " said @entity106 , a veteran @entity22 @entity106 leadership aide who worked for former house speaker @entity107 and @entity22 majority leader @entity108			1
" we did n't count on him for anything			1
in many ways , he was an ideological warrior , " @entity106 said			0
" many times , the vote would be 434 - 1 -- he 'd be the one , but he was the one who kind of put up the ideological goal posts -- this is where you should be if you 're pure , and what we found is no one is really pure except @entity2 , " he said			1
several @entity122 told @entity1 they admire his purism			0
" @entity124 puts up his vote , and if you want to know why , he tells you why			0
and if you want to vote with him , great , and there 's been a lot to be said for it , " said rep. @entity127 , @entity128 , who says he personally likes @entity73 very much			1
but @entity127 is one of several @entity2 legislative colleagues who say that his refusal to compromise often goes too far			1
" @entity2 is less like a @entity134 and more like somebody who is a great professor but you would n't want to have him run your company , " @entity127 said			1
so far , 64 members of @entity3 have endorsed @entity140			0
just three have endorsed @entity2 , the only sitting lawmaker in the race			2
one is @entity2 's son @entity142 , a senator from @entity143			1
another is @entity2 's good friend @entity145 , a fellow anti-war @entity106			1
" i like @entity2 's independence , " @entity145 told @entity1 in his office			1
" he knows we 've got to fix the problems of the @entity151 people			0
we 've got to fix the job situation			0
we 've got to bring this debt down , and i think he is exactly what @entity151 needs right now			0
" paul campaign rakes in $ 1.3 million in two days @entity145 has supported @entity2 for years and watched him extolling the importance of less involvement abroad , smaller government and greater personal liberties without finding mass appeal			2
@entity145 thinks @entity2 has caught fire now because he has been so consistent			2
" they trust him , " @entity145 said			0
@entity2 has a reputation in @entity3 as a loner			0
but @entity145 dismisses that by revealing a mock picture he displays in his office of @entity2 with congressional friends , dressed as the singing group @entity169			0
" it 's a great picture of him , " jokes @entity145			0
" he 's got the look of a president			0
" but @entity2 's good friend from @entity174 does concede that " he 's just not a socialite			1
" " he 's a workhorse , and that 's what @entity0 needs right now is a workhorse , not a show horse , " @entity145 said			0
he also warned that even if @entity2 is n't the nominee , the @entity31 needs to listen to him and show respect or risk losing the opportunity to capture some of @entity2 's supporters who are young and independent			1
" he brings a support base that is so truly committed to his points of views and his issues that if the party does n't find a way to bring @entity2 in , i do n't think he 's going to do anything outside of it , but he wo n't be very helpful			1
