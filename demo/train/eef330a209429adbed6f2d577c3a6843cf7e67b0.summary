@entity0 -- she 's not gon na make it			2
we give her 24 hours			2
@entity5 remembers lying on the hospital bed as the doctor uttered those words			1
a sense of relief came over her			2
" i did n't think about losing my children			2
i did n't think about leaving my mother , " she said			2
she thought instead of how death would feel			2
" although i will be dead , i will not be in pain anymore			0
" that searing pain came from an unimaginable source : a silicone filler , like the one @entity5 assumed plastic surgeons use daily			1
@entity19 was injected into her buttocks , with the hope of improving her appearance			0
@entity5 never predicted the injections would land her here -- dying in a hospital bed in june 2010			1
her body was shutting down from a staph infection that doctors said was connected to the silicone injections			1
her limbs were curling and turning black , the visible signs of necrosis			0
@entity5 recalled seeing her hands in the hospital , thinking , " oh , my @entity34			1
i am going to lose my hands			0
i looked at my feet , and they were dead , too			0
" doctors had no choice			0
to save @entity5 's life , they amputated her hands , feet and the flesh around her buttocks and hips in 27 surgeries			1
@entity5 is still embarrassed as she talks about the vanity that nearly cost her everything			1
living a good life , except for a flat ' flaw ' at the time , she was a successful hair stylist and owned a salon			0
when she was n't at her shop , she was busy raising two daughters			0
but @entity5 always wanted to fix what she saw as her " flaw			1
" ever since she was a little girl growing up in @entity56 , @entity5 remembers being teased about having a flat butt			1
growing up , she always wanted a fuller posterior and even had a mantra , " when i get me some money , i am going to get me some butt			1
" in 2004 , while she was working on a new client 's hair , she got her chance			0
the client happened to mention she did silicone injections cheaply			1
with a few sessions , she told @entity68 , she could obtain the shape she had always wanted			0
a week later , she found herself in a house lying down in a bedroom receiving her first of four injections into her butt cheeks			1
following her second treatment , @entity5 remembers doubting her decision			1
" a voice just came to me like , ' what are you doing ? are you serious ? you are going to allow somebody to inject something into your body and you have no idea what it is			0
' " @entity5 decided that day to stop doing the treatments and never went back			1
the true cost of the injections would come later , following years of pain and visits with doctors			1
@entity5 's story may be severe , but she is part of what the @entity91 calls a growing problem : patients bypassing doctors just to save some money on basic medical procedures			1
" i think that 's awfully seductive to a person who does n't know there 's a problem , " said dr. @entity97 , a clinical professor of dermatology at the @entity99 , @entity100			0
he says he is seeing a disturbing trend , as patients turn to plastic surgeons such as him after getting botched facial filler injections			1
the injections are used to smooth out facial lines			1
some of the patients @entity97 sees have traveled out of country and had these cosmetic procedures done cheaply			0
others are purchasing cosmetic fillers from websites and self - injecting these dermal fillers into their faces			1
often , the patients have no idea what 's in the dermal filler , nor do they receive the procedure from a licensed medical professional			1
" people assume it 's just as easy as getting your hair colored , and at the end of the day it 's a medical procedure , " @entity97 said			2
would - be patients need to know the facts in the @entity131 , there are only 21 @entity132 approved dermal fillers			1
these must be administered by a medical provider or under the supervision of a physician			0
none of the @entity132 - approved dermal filler devices is approved for self - injection			1
there are hundreds of nonapproved dermal fillers available around the world			2
but @entity144 cautions against having the procedure done out of country or trying to do it yourself			0
" i would n't do it			0
i think you belong in a doctor 's office where a physician is supervising this and you can depend on where they have sourced the material			0
" as far as buying it online , @entity97 says it 's easy for patients to take the leap			2
" if we live in a world where you buy your @entity165 shoes at @entity166 or you can buy them online at @entity167 and it 's the same shoe , i think you 're expecting what you see on a website as full value and true			2
" one of his recent patients came to him after purchasing a non-fda - approved dermal filler marketed on the internet with just a credit card and a stroke of the keys			1
in a few days , the cosmetic filler she purchased from the website @entity184 arrived postmarked from @entity185			2
she had her friend , who was a registered nurse , inject her face with the dermal filler			1
a week later , her cheeks started to react			0
@entity97 says it appeared that there were " red , angry nodules in the cheeks			0
" he had to surgically drain the area , which had " lakes of pus under the skin , " and excise the material from her cheeks			0
after the surgery , @entity97 had the material from her face tested			0
the @entity99 dermatopathology results showed there was some type of " refractile material " found in her cheeks			0
@entity144 describes the material as low - grade " glass or fiberglass			2
" the patient 's body was rejecting that material			0
after repeated attempts by @entity1 to contact @entity214 for a comment about selling non-fda - approved dermal fillers on its website , @entity212 e-mailed , " it has nothing to do with the product but the procedure			1
" two days later , when @entity1 went to @entity184 , all that appeared was a blank white screen and the words : " @entity222 denied			0
" scars are a reminder of a bad decision while @entity97 's patient is on the road to recovery , she will always have some visible scars on her face			0
@entity144 has a warning to people considering purchasing dermal fillers themselves			1
" what we want to do is at least make the patients aware that there is a danger lurking for them out there , and they have to be careful , " says @entity97			0
@entity5 considers herself a living example of what happens when you 're not careful			1
she does n't hesitate to tell others about how she suffered in extreme pain for five long years after the silicone injections			2
she explains how she watched her buttocks harden and discolor , seeing doctor after doctor to try to get help			0
she lifts what 's left of her arms and explains what was actually injected in her buttocks			0
when her doctors tested the substance injected into her body , @entity5 says it was bathroom caulk			1
@entity5 does n't know what happened to the woman who injected her			1
at 47 , @entity5 has had to learn to do everything all over again with prosthetics			1
she is able to live on her own with the help of an aide who comes in to help her for a few hours a day			0
she does n't want pity ; she wants people to listen to her cautionary story			2
" all i would ask them to do is , when you have that first thought , make sure they have a second thought about it and do a little research			0
and if they still want to do it , go for it			0
they wo n't be blindsided , saying , ' oh , my @entity34 , i had no idea that a simple procedure like that can leave me with no hands , no feet and no butt cheeks			2
' " @entity5 has a new mission in life to spread the word about what happened to her and a different mantra : " we are enough and we were made to be enough			1
