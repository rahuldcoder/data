-- one of @entity2 's most important seaports is now under the control of the military in a show of force as the government fights corruption and drug cartel violence			1
the port of @entity11 lies on the country 's @entity12 , in the troubled state of @entity15			1
while violence has tapered off in some parts of @entity2 , @entity15 continues to be a hot spot of violence between cartels and , more recently , vigilante groups			1
the @entity2 navy , army , federal police and attorney general 's office swept into both the port and city of @entity11 on monday , relieving local law enforcement of its duties , a government spokesman said			1
the objective of the operation is to " strengthen the rule of law , as well as the legality of the daily commercial activities of the port , " government spokesman @entity32 said			1
the use of the military is notable because it is strikingly similar to the approach favored by the previous administration			2
president @entity44 has been critical of his predecessor 's military approach to combat crime , but his own drug strategy keeps many aspects the same			1
the @entity51 cartel has long terrorized residents of @entity15 as it expanded its activities from methamphetamine production to extortion			0
the cartel has been known to go on the offensive against police			0
in one series of attacks this summer , 22 people were killed			0
given the violence in @entity15 , @entity44 has had little choice but to follow the strategy of former president @entity64 , said @entity65 , a professor of government at the @entity67 and expert on drug cartels			0
a number of factors have made @entity11 an attractive port for smuggling			1
for one , many of the young men who worked for the port and found themselves unemployed during the recession became prime recruits for the cartels , @entity65 said			0
a selling point for legitimate commerce -- that the port is in a central location -- also attracted smugglers , he added			0
corruption has grown to the point that @entity15 became a " sewer of corruption and violence , " @entity65 said			0
according to @entity32 , the navy will be in charge of the port , and the army will provide protection on the city 's streets , with the aid of federal police			2
the problem 's facing the port and city are not limited to criminal groups			2
as the military moved in , the city 's entire police was disarmed and detained , @entity32 said			2
the officers will all be evaluated			0
all of the public servants who oversee the port will be gradually replaced , he said , in order to " prevent collusion by and between officials			0
" @entity11 is one of @entity2 's key ports , handling the second-most volume of any port			1
community police take on @entity2 cartels @entity117 contributed to this report .			2

the @entity2 military has taken control of the port of @entity11
the port , on the country 's @entity12 , is one of the *busiest* in @entity2
the goal of the operation is to *thwart* smuggling and corruption
