-- it 's no @entity2			2
@entity4 , it 's no @entity5 , but for an @entity14 audience , monday 's @entity10 derby -- that is , the @entity7 club soccer game between @entity10 's two @entity9 teams -- is about as big as it gets stateside			1
sure , many @entity14 sports fans call the sport boring and complain there 's not enough scoring			1
it moves too slowly , they say , and is marred by @entity20 who flop to the ground if you breathe on them			2
haters aside , the @entity14 is taking notice			1
@entity26 moved the game from @entity26 to its flagship station , a first for a weekday @entity9 game			1
pubs across the nation are anticipating big crowds , and some @entity14 are doing something very @entity35 for match day : skipping out of work early			1
" you 'll definitely want to see this			2
it 's as high a stakes game as you 'll see in any soccer league in the world , " said @entity43 senior writer and soccer guru , @entity40			1
@entity40 likened the match between no. 1 @entity49 and no. 2 @entity50 to the @entity52 and @entity53 playing in the @entity2 , or perhaps the @entity54 , which pits cross-state rivals @entity55 and @entity56 against each other at the end of the college football season			1
@entity61 experience key to @entity62 he 's never seen a @entity10 derby this important in the 15 years he 's been covering soccer , said @entity40 , who authored the book , " @entity66 : how the @entity68 tried to @entity69			1
" @entity26 announced this week it moved the game to take advantage of the live edition of " sportscenter " that will lead into the game , which begins at 3 p.m. et. in an e-mail , spokesman @entity70 said the paid programming on @entity26 prior to the game typically draws about 221,000 viewers , where " @entity74 " will have an expected audience of 482,000			1
the live lead - in is key to sports programming , he said			0
the network 's @entity9 offerings on @entity26 this year are 50 % percent higher than last year 's games , so @entity7 soccer 's popularity is increasing in the @entity14 , @entity70 said			1
" best matchup of the season , " @entity70 said of monday 's game			1
" so far , 20 teams have each played an average of 36 matches			0
and with two match - days to go , @entity9 has one game that is akin to a title game in a league series not decided by knockouts			1
" we 've come a long way @entity35 sports commentator @entity102 , who will be calling the game for @entity26 , predicts a " turbo - charged occasion " and said he has noticed @entity69 's growing interest in soccer since @entity106 hired him to call games for the @entity14 - hosted @entity108 in 1994			1
" producers ( back then ) said to explain what offsides was and explain the laws of the game as we went along , " he recalled			2
" now , there 's been a complete change of emphasis			0
" today , more @entity14 -- many of whom played the sport in school and youth leagues -- have a better grasp on the basics , and commentators cover games in a more " authentic way , as if it were being broadcast for a @entity129 audience			1
" @entity26 is n't the only one sensing the game taking off in the states			1
@entity132 , a bartender at @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135 , said that not so long ago @entity133 was the premier place to watch @entity7 soccer in the city			1
as the game has become more popular , more bars carry the matches and more people get the games at home , so the number of patrons coming to watch soccer at @entity133 has taken a hit			1
of the derby monday , @entity132 said he 's received calls from people asking if he 's showing it , and he expects a few more patrons than usual during the lunchtime rush			1
a @entity0 facebook page asking if fans were planning to skip work or school monday drew plenty of the aforementioned haters , but a handful of fans said they 'd be playing hooky			1
" will be skipping class at @entity165 and have already re-scheduled couple meetings already , " wrote @entity163 , a @entity49 fan			0
" work ? school ? bills ? life ? all of it stops when the @entity172 is in play ! " wrote fellow @entity170			1
added @entity174 , " i 'm coming home very early from work			2
" continue the conversation on @entity178 here fado @entity180 pubs in @entity181 , @entity182 , and @entity183 say they 're expecting plenty of people to forsake their professors and employers			1
both are tripling their staff			0
@entity181 general manager @entity190 is expecting about 200 people for the game , which airs there at 2 p.m. in @entity183 , general manager @entity194 said he is expecting a similar crowd			1
though he 's bringing in the doorman who generally works only on weekends , he 's not anticipating any problems with the crowd , he said			2
" we 'll just make sure the volume is loud , the @entity202 are on and we have enough staff to get everyone food and drinks , " @entity194 said			0
what 's the big deal anyway ? so , the uninitiated may be asking , why all the fuss over this particular game ? well , there are many storylines			2
the first is that it 's a derby , so there 's the longstanding city rivalry in addition to the championship implications			1
@entity49 's @entity218 and @entity50 's @entity219 are separated by about five miles , so you can imagine how the game divides friends , family , coworkers and neighbors			2
@entity226 , assistant chief executive for the @entity227 , called it " one of the most anticipated derbies this city has seen for a decade " and said those not lucky enough to get tickets , which are commanding Â £ 1,300 ( $ 2,115 ) online , will be filling up the city 's pubs or gathering around the tv at home			1
police are n't expecting problems , according to a statement from superintendent @entity241 , but they 've asked local businesses to " take extra safety measures such as using plastic glasses , employing more door staff and keeping an eye on the front of house			2
... people will see extra patrols			0
this is not because we are expecting trouble ; it is to make sure people feel safe to come and watch the match			1
" @entity26 's @entity102 , who has been covering @entity7 derbies for almost 40 years , said he is expecting a rowdy and raucous atmosphere			1
" @entity10 's going to be quite a lively place , no matter the outcome			2
i might bring a tin helmet like the soldiers wear , " he said with a chuckle			1
another reason for the hullabaloo is that both teams are insanely wealthy			0
for @entity49 , the reigning @entity7 champs , this is nothing new			1
founded in 1878 , the team boasts 19 @entity7 championships and three @entity129 crowns			1
@entity50 , on the other hand , has n't won the @entity7 title since 1968 and played unremarkably for the better part of four decades until @entity275 of the @entity277 royal family bought the team in 2008			1
@entity49 has always been the " glamour team " with the big players , where @entity50 have been the forgettable step - relatives , and " @entity50 fans are wearily philosophical about it , " @entity102 said			0
" @entity50 fans are sick to death of @entity49 ruling their roost , and here 's their chance , " he said			0
" they will celebrate like there 's no tomorrow if they pull it off			0
" both teams are now among the most loaded clubs in the world			0
the professional services firm , @entity294 , reported that with â ‚ ¬ 367 million ( $ 487 million ) , @entity49 was no. 3 in revenues last year , behind @entity298 powerhouses @entity296 and @entity299			0
@entity50 came in at 11th with â ‚ ¬ 170 million ( $ 225 million )			0
to give you an idea what these figures mean , @entity300 reported that average revenue among @entity307 teams in 2010 was $ 261 million			0
@entity50 and @entity49 have used their fortunes to acquire some of the biggest soccer names in the world : @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 among them			2
the five dozen players on the two teams represent stars from 23 countries			0
" ( @entity50 ) bought a lot of talent , " said @entity43 's @entity40			0
" the question is whether they bought a great team			0
the questions are going to remain until they win a title			0
" @entity325 also stoking interest in the match is soap - opera - like drama surrounding it			2
not only has the injection of @entity331 cash made @entity50 more competitive , but the @entity332 thrashed the @entity14 - owned @entity49 6 - 1 during their first meeting , a result @entity40 called " the most shocking result we 've seen all year			2
" @entity50 stood atop the @entity9 for months until march , when @entity49 seemed to find its form and took the lead			0
from there , it seemed a @entity49 repeat was inevitable , but in recent weeks , the tables have turned again			0
@entity49 has a win , loss and tie in its last three matches , while @entity50 has three wins			0
each team 's coach has engaged in a bit of psychological banter ahead of the fixture			0
@entity49 's @entity61 has prohibited his team from making statements about the game , calling it the most important derby since he took over the club in 1986			1
@entity50 's @entity357 cheekily fired back that the 6 - 1 drubbing earlier this year was more important			0
in a strange twist , he also said his team has no chance of winning the title and went so far as to congratulate @entity49 on its championship with three games remaining			2
@entity357 simply knows his team performed better as underdogs this season than they did when they sat atop the table , @entity102 said			0
" he knows how big this game is			2
everything he 's been saying in the last few days , he 's trying to take pressure off his players , " he said			0
" it 's the lousiest piece of psychological warfare ever			0
" @entity49 will have to go into @entity219 , where @entity50 has n't lost all season , and snatch three points to ensure their second championship in as many years			2
@entity50 is three points behind @entity49 , but with a win , can take the @entity9 lead			0
they 'll be tied with @entity49 in the points column but will take first place because they have scored one more goal than @entity49 and given up five fewer than the @entity382 this season			0
though @entity50 is the favorite in the betting houses , no one seemed comfortable offering a prediction			0
@entity102 said his thoughts on the outcome were meaningless			0
i 'd just urge people to watch it , " he said .			0
