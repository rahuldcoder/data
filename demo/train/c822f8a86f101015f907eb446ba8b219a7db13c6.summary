@entity0 -- in a move intended to better track criminal suspects , @entity0 's finest are now photographing the eyes of those they haul in			1
adding eye scans to a list of police identification methods that include mug shots and fingerprinting , @entity0 rolled out a fleet of new iris scanners in an initiative announced earlier this week , city officials said			1
the new measures are part of an effort to improve security and safeguard identities , said police commissioner @entity21			1
" it 's a big , complex system , " @entity21 said			0
" we want to make sure it 's the right person when they get in front of the judge , so this is a common sense way to do that			0
" police turned to scanners after two recent incidents in which prisoners escaped using false identities			1
upon arrest , suspects now will be required to look directly into binocular - like devices that photograph the iris -- the circular diaphragm forming the colored portion of the eye -- and store the image in a police database			1
when the suspect appears in court , police will match the scan to see whether the image corresponds with records in the system , @entity21 said			2
but the tiny cameras are drawing opposition from civil liberties groups who call the new police measures excessive			1
" the police department is hitting a fly with a sledgehammer , " said @entity55 , attorney in chief of the city 's @entity57			1
" there 's been an extensive legislative debate in @entity64 in which the legislature only permits the police department to collect dna evidence in certain kinds of cases			2
so it 's incumbent upon the police department not to find a whole new technology and then forge ahead without any legislative authority			2
" proponents of the devices say the new initiative falls within existing identification measures			2
" we are authorized to take pictures , " @entity21 said			2
" this is just a picture of your iris			0
... we 're matching that iris to see if you 're the same individual			0
our lawyers say we do n't need any mandate to do it			0
" twenty - one machines will be set up throughout the city , @entity21 said , which includes scanners employed in @entity90 earlier this week			1
police put the price tag at $ 500,000 , paid for through a @entity93 @entity95 grant , which raises the question whether the device could be potentially used an anti-terrorism tool			0
" that 's not our intention here , but it has potential , " @entity21 said			0
" just like all technology has potential for growth , for innovation , for development , " he added			0
" but right now , this is simply a process to help us better identify someone and prevent us from making mistakes			0
