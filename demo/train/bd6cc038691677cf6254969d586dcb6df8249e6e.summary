@entity6 's " @entity5 , " the first sitcom to feature an @entity2 family in two decades , has run into renewed controversy a week before its debut			1
while the show has been praised for its potential to rebut stereotypes , its social media team flubbed when it tweeted a graphic featuring caricatures of different races underneath the phrase " we 're all a little # @entity9			1
" if anything , the ad reinforced tired imagery : one @entity2 figure wore a pointy bamboo hat ; another @entity24 figure wore a sombrero with a curly mustache			1
story creator @entity27 , whose memoirs the sitcom is based on , was furious			1
" this is plain offensive and ridiculous , " he tweeted			1
" someone please reverse this ... at least they did n't do the @entity33 with chicken pox blankie lol " " @entity35 is n't whether we in fact wear kufis and rice hats but it 's reductive , " he added			2
@entity42 columnist @entity41 , whose son @entity44 stars in the series , tweeted that the ad was " awful			2
" the controversy came just weeks after @entity27 publicly slammed the show 's producers in a lengthy @entity51 piece , accusing the network of distorting his memoir into a " cornstarch story about @entity2 resembling moo goo gai pan " in order to make it more appealing to white audiences			1
but he later backed off the comments in a panel discussion on the issue , saying he did n't have a problem with the show 's executive producer and felt his memoir , published in 2013 , was portrayed " fairly			2
" there was also an awkward moment at the discussion when a journalist asked the show 's cast whether the sitcom would involve " chopsticks			1
" the ad also restarted online debate over another contentious part of the sitcom : its name			1
the phrase " fresh off the boat , " typically shortened to the acronym " fob , " is a loaded phrase many young @entity83 immigrants will recognize			2
depending on who you ask , it 's either a slang term or a slur used to label minorities , often @entity2 , who have n't fully assimilated with the mainstream			2
@entity27 deals with the term in his memoir -- also named " @entity5 " -- recalling a moment he heard it being used to insult his father			1
" he never forgot it , " he writes			2
" we were n't @entity83 like everyone else			0
we 'd always be the other in this bullshit country			0
" @entity102 , a history professor at @entity103 , says the term is painful because " it aligns with @entity2 always having to negotiate the fear of being perceived as a perpetual foreigner			0
because the consequences can be anything from bullying and ostracism , to violence or internment			0
" but @entity27 and @entity41 have argued that naming the show " @entity5 " is an expression of immigrant pride , and can help to " reclaim " the term as something positive			1
" it 's a term whose claws should and can be removed , " @entity41 tells @entity7			0
" but only if we have an honest and open discussion about what it means to be @entity83 , and why a nation of immigrants remains so hostile toward those who are newly arrived			0
" concerns over the phrase are n't new			0
when the show was announced last may , some @entity2 worried openly -- what if the show inadvertently encourages people to toss the phrase around in an offensive way ? what if , instead of deepening @entity83 's understanding of the immigrants ' difficulties , the show simply gives people another opportunity to mock them ? perhaps , some argue , these thorny issues only get harder to untangle when they 're thrust into the mainstream			1
as @entity102 explains , " i sort of feel like ' fob ' is a family issue , you know -- like internal to @entity2 ? we need to reclaim it or something first before we put it out there in front of other people			0
" but the show is stepping into the spotlight next week			0
and even its strongest supporters are nervous			0
" we 're all hoping that this works , " says @entity41			0
" because 20 years of wandering in the wilderness is damn well enough			0
