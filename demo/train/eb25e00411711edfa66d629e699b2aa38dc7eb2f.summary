-- it 's like motor racing on water -- deafening music blares out in the countdown to races , and fans flock to the water 's edge			1
welcome to the @entity10 , extreme by name and extreme by nature			1
expect capsizing , high - speed wipeouts and crashes involving catamarans that are twice the size of the biggest @entity18 boats -- and notably faster , reaching top speeds of 30 knots			2
that 's a speed of 35 mph ( 56 kph ) -- maybe not as quick as an elite sports car , but fast enough for huge adrenalin surge			2
races take place across the globe , from narrow @entity28 canal waterways to @entity30 's spacious harbor for the season finale			1
it 's also awash with star sailors , including two - time @entity35 winner @entity34 , @entity36 , whose tactics helped guide @entity38 to victory in @entity40 last year , and 2013 losing skipper @entity41			1
it 's no surprise , then , that extreme sailing has been described as the @entity44 of the water -- although it 's less wheel - to - wheel and more hull - to - hull racing			1
for his part , @entity50 , himself a @entity44 fan , likens it to another form of motorsport : " it 's basically sailing 's version of stock - car racing			1
the courses are very short and there are collisions and spills			0
" this is sailing with a twist , as crews regularly employ guests on board , often celebrities , with the likes of @entity70 singer @entity69 , @entity72 boss @entity71 , former @entity74 cricketer @entity73 and current @entity76 rugby skipper @entity75 having tackled the world 's waters in competition			2
the 2014 season -- the seventh since its inception -- starts in @entity83 on thursday			0
it will be @entity50 's first race since winning the @entity35 and , as well as being a means to whet his appetite for future events , there is also a more serious purpose to his involvement this time around			1
" when you do n't race for a long time , it gives you that burning hunger again , " he says			0
" there 's definitely the hunger to get back and race , that 's what i do			2
" the series is a laugh too but it 's also the closest thing this year to the multihulls of @entity35 racing , which is the main goal			1
" @entity50 is still plotting a @entity106 team entry into sailing 's premier event , aiming to raise the $ 100 million budget required as well as get the necessary expertise on board to captain his own crew , having helped @entity38 storm back from an 8 - 1 deficit to beat @entity115 9 - 8 in a thrilling title defense			2
yet for all his experience and expertise , the four - time @entity18 champion could finish well down the pecking order in the @entity10 , when he is paired against sailors for whom the sport is deeply ingrained from seasons past			1
among those is compatriot @entity125 , a one - time olympian who makes no secret of the fact that @entity50 was his hero as he came through the ranks of @entity106 sailing			0
@entity125 's boat , @entity131 , is the one to beat as the 33 - year - old seeks a hat - trick of titles			1
" it 's a bit of a dream to be racing against @entity36 , " says @entity125			1
" he 's done fantastic things for the sport of sailing , and i 'm excited about the challenge of racing against him			1
" i hope to learn a lot from him			0
if i beat him , it will be the proudest moment of my career			0
" winning events this year will be really , really hard , maybe the toughest season ever			2
it will be extremely difficult , especially as we 're racing against potential @entity35 teams with the resources that go with it			1
" for his part , @entity125 describes the racing , which involves crews of five on the extreme 40 vessels , with a vip or guest as well , as " hectic			2
" this year 's series begins in @entity83 and ends in @entity30 , with visits to @entity162 , @entity163 , and @entity164 , @entity165 among others			1
each of the eight rounds of the series are known as acts , such a title adding further to the drama on show			0
there are four days of racing at each act -- one open - water and three other stadium - racing days in front of the eyes of an expectant public			1
it 's short , sharp racing , each lasting just 10 to 12 minutes , and the first over the finish line wins			1
points of a maximum of 10 are awarded for the eight daily races and the crew with the most points at the end of each act is the winner			1
the team with the highest number of points across all the regattas claims the series trophy			0
@entity125 admits the racing can get nasty on occasion , such is the competitive nature of the sailors			2
" i know @entity36 's got a reputation for being quite aggressive but we can be aggressive too , " he says			1
" i 'm quite feisty but also with my experience you have to sail the percentages			0
you want to stay out of sticky situations , to avoid crashes and to avoid the jury having to make decisions			0
" crashes do happen though , and not surprisingly with relative frequency compared to most sailing racing formats			1
" i 've been involved in the series from the start and i 'm still amazed by the adrenalin buzz i get from it each and every time we race , " adds @entity125			0
" you get crashes and it can get quite close for comfort			0
but the boats are really , really strong -- they 're so very well built			0
if the crashes do happen , things are set up that they 're fixed overnight			2
" despite some impressive collisions and capsizes , organizer @entity223 believes only one boat has lost out a day 's racing as a result of a prang -- a remarkable achievement bearing in mind the topsy - turvy nature of this form of racing			1
@entity234 does not quite agree with @entity50 's stock - car - racing analogy , but he says the unpredictable sailing certainly differs to the @entity44 seasons of recent years			2
while @entity237 has sauntered to four straight titles , @entity125 's potential for a treble could well have been scuppered at the final hurdle in 2013			0
" last season came down to the last act of the last race of the last day , " @entity234 says			0
" that gives you an indication of how close it tends to be			0
" from its outset , the @entity10 has tried to be different -- from the element of stadium racing that @entity234 and his team first introduced , to the idea of getting guest sailors , whether they be celebrities , journalists or sponsors			1
it means crews have to engage in top - flight racing with a complete stranger on board			0
" sailing too often is not accessible to the public , so we wanted to ensure they were within touching distance of the racing , " says @entity234			0
" it was a huge risk as it had never been done before			0
we wanted to put boats inside a stadium			0
of course , there was some negativity from the purists but i think we 're over that now			0
" it 's been a long road to get this far but it really feels like we 're on the brink of taking it to the next level			0
