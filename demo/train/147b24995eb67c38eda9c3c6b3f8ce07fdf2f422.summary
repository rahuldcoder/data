-- it 's no longer enough to have smartphones , smartwatches , smart tvs and smart cars			2
now a tech company is bringing artificial intelligence to lingerie			0
researchers at @entity10 have developed a prototype of a " smart bra " embedded with physiological sensors that seek to monitor a woman 's heart activity to track her emotional moods and combat overeating			1
the sensors can signal the wearer 's smartphone , which then flash a warning message to help her step away from the fridge and make better diet decisions			1
the company says it has no plans to make the bra into a commercial product , however			1
so -- why a bra , exactly ? " first , we needed a form factor that would be comfortable when worn for long durations , " said scientists in a research paper published online			2
" the bra form factor was ideal because it allowed us to collect ( electrocardiogram data ) near the heart			0
" research has shown that many people reach for calorie - rich foods like doughnuts when they 're feeling stressed , bored , discouraged or on edge			0
there 's a reason it 's called comfort food			0
for the research paper , scientists from @entity10 , the @entity46 and the @entity47 in the @entity48 interviewed women who said that interventions -- being alerted to their emotional states -- helped them identify triggers for binge eating			2
bionic fashion : wearable tech will turn man into machine by 2015 the researchers then conducted a study in which four women wore the sensors in their bras for four days to monitor their vital signs			2
an electrocardiogram ( @entity67 ) sensor under the arm measured their heart rate , while an electrodermal activity ( @entity72 ) sensor tracked their perspiration			0
the researchers determined the bra was mostly effective in detecting its wearer 's emotional changes			1
but the sensors needed to be recharged every three to four hours , which limited how long the bra could be worn			2
and more research would be needed before a smart brassiere -- @entity10 's @entity83 , anyone ? -- ever became a viable product			1
a @entity10 spokesperson downplayed the bra 's significance in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" the bra sensing system is just one instance of a class of work from a group of @entity10 researchers that is focused on the broader topic of affective computing , or designing devices and services that are sensitive to people 's moods and react accordingly , " the spokesperson said			1
" while we will continue our research in affective computing , @entity10 has no plans to develop a bra with sensors			1
" what about a similar undergarment for men ? researchers did n't rule it out			0
" we will continue to explore how to build a robust , real - world system that stands up to everyday challenges with regards to battery life , comfortability , and being suitable for both men and women , " the researchers said in the paper			0
reaction to the bra on @entity123 ranged from amusement to annoyance			0
" anyone else offended that @entity10 is devoting its tech research to a bra designed to prevent women from overeating ? " tweeted a @entity127 woman whose @entity123 handle is @ cunningminx			1
added @entity135 of @entity136 , " if nothing else convinces you we need more women in tech , this should			0
no , i do n't want someone hacking my bra ... " the wave of wearable computers			0

researchers developed a bra prototype with sensors to monitor a woman 's emotional state
the bra could send alerts to the wearer 's phone to combat overeating
new : @entity10 says it has no plans to make the bra into a commercial product
