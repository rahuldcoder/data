-- an antibiotic widely used to treat diarrhea in travelers may also provide some relief to people with the common and difficult - to - treat condition known as irritable bowel syndrome , according to a pair of new studies in the @entity10			1
the @entity11 has not yet approved the antibiotic , rifaximin , for use in @entity15 , which affects as many as 1 in 5 @entity17 adults			1
the agency is currently reviewing the drug for that purpose and is expected to make a decision in march			0
in the studies , 1,200 @entity15 patients took rifaximin or a placebo pill three times a day for two weeks			1
roughly 40 percent of the patients who took the antibiotic reported substantial relief from symptoms such as bloating , abdominal pain , and loose stools for at least two weeks during the subsequent month , compared with a little under one - third of the patients taking placebo			1
all of the patients in the studies had a form of @entity15 that does not involve constipation			1
@entity0 : 12 surprising causes of constipation " it made all the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome better , which we do n't see too often in studies , " says the lead researcher , @entity42 , @entity43 , a gastroenterologist at @entity44 , in @entity45			2
the studies were funded by the maker of rifaximin , @entity54 , which was also involved in collecting and analyzing the data			2
( this arrangement is n't unusual in these types of studies , which are known as phase 3 trials and are generally the last research step in the @entity11 approval process			1
) in addition , @entity42 and several of his co-authors report financial relationships with @entity65 , including receiving consulting fees from the company			0
@entity0 : @entity68 cures for stomach troubles @entity70 , sold under the brand name @entity70 for travelers ' diarrhea , appears to be safe and does n't seem to foster resistance among gut bacteria , meaning it can be used over and over , @entity42 says			0
that could be important , because the number of study participants who reported lasting relief from their two - week rifaximin regimen gradually declined in the 10 weeks following treatment			2
despite the relatively small percentage of patients who responded to the drug , doctors who have been frustrated by the lack of effective @entity15 treatments say they would welcome another option			2
@entity91 , @entity43 , a professor of internal medicine at @entity93 , in @entity94 , says that while she 'd hoped to see a " more robust effect " from rifaximin in the studies , she nevertheless would like the @entity11 to approve the drug for @entity15			1
" it still provides me with something i can offer my patients , " says @entity91 , who was not involved in the new research			0
@entity0 : 10 things that can make incontinence worse currently , " there are no good options " for treating @entity15 , says @entity104 , @entity43 , a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of internal medicine at @entity107 , in @entity108			2
@entity70 may benefit a subgroup of patients with @entity15 , @entity104 says , although he stresses that most people in the study did not experience relief from their symptoms			1
" as a doctor , i 'd need to treat 10 patients for one to improve , " he adds			0
rifaximin would be the first antibiotic approved by the @entity11 for the treatment of @entity15			1
aside from providing evidence of the drug 's effectiveness , the study findings -- especially with regard to bloating -- support the theory that bacteria may be partially responsible for @entity15			0
@entity0 : alternative therapies for irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity15 ) bloating is sometimes thought to be related to bacterial imbalances in the gut , and antibiotics are a class of drugs that work only against bacteria			0
" that suggests that we hit upon a cause of @entity15 , " @entity42 says			0
this theory is still controversial			0
@entity91 says that while there is some evidence to suggest that bacteria plays a role in @entity15 , it 's unclear whether changes in gut bacteria are a cause or an effect of the syndrome			0

new studies show that an antibiotic may provide relief to people with @entity15
about 40 percent of the patients who took the antibiotic reported relief from symptoms
the @entity11 has not yet approved the antibiotic , rifaximin , for use in @entity15
