editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 , is governor of @entity4			1
@entity4 gov. @entity2 says taxing soft drinks could help combat obesity			1
@entity7 , @entity4 ( @entity8 ) -- like many @entity10 , i remember a time when nearly everyone smoked			1
in 1950 , @entity13 's reported that more than three - quarters of adult men smoked			1
this epidemic had a devastating and long - lasting impact on public health			2
today , we find ourselves in the midst of a new public health epidemic : childhood obesity			1
what smoking was to my parents ' generation , obesity is to my children 's generation			1
nearly one out of every four @entity10 under the age of 18 is obese			0
in many high - poverty areas , the rate is closer to one out of three			0
that is why , in the state budget i presented last tuesday , i proposed a tax on sugared beverages like soda			0
research has demonstrated that soft - drink consumption is one of the main drivers of childhood obesity			1
for example , a study by @entity45 researchers found that each additional 12 - ounce soft drink consumed per day increases the risk of a child becoming obese by 60 percent			2
for adults , the association is similar			0
if we are to succeed in reducing childhood obesity , we must reduce consumption of sugared beverages			2
that is the purpose of our proposed tax			0
we estimate that an 18 percent tax will reduce consumption by five percent			0
our tax would apply only to sugared drinks -- including fruit drinks that are less than 70 percent juice -- that are nondiet			2
the $ 404 million this tax would raise next year will go toward funding public health programs , including obesity prevention programs , across @entity4			1
the surgeon general estimates that obesity was associated with 112,000 deaths in the @entity71 every year			1
here in @entity4 , we spend almost $ 6.1 billion on health care related to adult obesity -- the second - highest level of spending in the nation			1
last year , legitimate concerns about links between consumption of fast food and the prevalence of heart disease prompted @entity10 to ban the use of trans fats in restaurant food			0
no one can deny the urgency of reducing the rate of obesity , including childhood obesity			2
obesity causes serious health problems like type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol			1
it puts children at much greater risk for life - threatening conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer			2
we must never stigmatize children who are overweight or obese			2
yet , for the sake of our children 's health , we have an obligation to address this crisis			1
i believe we can ultimately curb the obesity epidemic the same way we curbed smoking : through smart public policy			0
in recent decades , anti-smoking campaigns have raised awareness			0
smoking bans have been enacted and enforced			0
and , perhaps most importantly , we have raised the price of cigarettes			1
in june , @entity4 raised the state cigarette tax an additional $ 1.25			0
according to the @entity117 , this increase alone will prevent more than 243,000 kids from smoking , save more than 37,000 lives and produce more than $ 5 billion in health care savings			0
these taxes may be unpopular , but their benefits are undeniable			0
last month , the @entity125 reported that , for the first time in generations , fewer than 20 percent of @entity71 smoked			1
lung cancer rates have finally begun to decline			0
as a result , we are all healthier			0
just as the cigarette tax has helped reduce the number of smokers and smoking - related deaths , a tax on highly caloric , non-nutritional beverages can help reduce the prevalence of obesity			1
to address the obesity crisis , we need more than just a surcharge on soda			1
we need to take junk food out of our schools			0
we need to encourage our children to exercise more			0
and we need to increase the availability of healthy food in underserved communities			0
but to make serious progress in this effort , we need to reduce the consumption of high - calorie drinks like nondiet soda among children and adults			1
i understand that @entity10 may not like paying a surcharge for their favorite drinks			2
but surely it 's a small price to pay for our children 's health			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

gov. @entity2 : at one time , most @entity71 men smoked cigarettes
he says higher cigarette taxes helped drive down the number of smokers
@entity2 says obesity causes major health problems and billions in costs
a surcharge on soft drinks is a small price to pay for children 's health , he says
