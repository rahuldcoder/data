-- a @entity2 general was gunned down in the heart of the capital on saturday , according to state media , as fresh violence flared in several cities and world powers mulled a way to halt the government 's bloody offensive against civilians			1
an " armed terrorist group " assassinated @entity14			1
gen. @entity17 , a military physician who was the director of @entity18 , in front of his @entity21 house saturday morning , the state - run @entity15 said			1
three gunmen shot him to death , the media outlet said			2
the killing occurred " in the framework of targeting the @entity2 intellectuals and the medical and technical cadres , " @entity15 reported			2
" a number of efficient , skilled and specialized national cadres were assassinated by armed terrorist groups , " said @entity15 , which cited the killings of a professor , a nuclear specialist , a teacher and a couple of engineers			2
@entity39 once headed the arthritis division at @entity41 and received medical training in @entity43 and @entity44			0
@entity45 , a @entity2 expert at the @entity46 , said @entity17 is from a powerful @entity48 military family and is a relative of @entity50 , the former head of air force intelligence under @entity52 , president @entity53 's father and predecessor			0
the @entity55 is @entity48 , a minority in @entity57 - dominated @entity2 that has a major presence in the military and government			0
@entity45 said air force intelligence is a powerful unit that is in charge of missile systems and investigating military defections			0
@entity52 was in that military branch			0
@entity68 , a defense analyst also at the institute , told @entity0 that @entity17 was not likely a senior officer or affiliated with a key regime unit			1
@entity68 said he believed the assassination was the first of a higher - ranking @entity2 officer in the capital			1
the capital has not been engulfed with the same kind of daily violence other cities have during the 11 - month @entity2 uprising , but the killing and recent attacks in @entity21 could be a sign that the resistance is spreading to the seats of power			1
free @entity88 lt. col. @entity87 said @entity17 is " definitely close to @entity53 's inner circle " and that his family has been close to both @entity53 and his father			1
the @entity92 is the anti-regime resistance group led by military defectors			1
the deputy head of the @entity92 said the killing could have been carried out by the regime itself			2
the @entity53 regime " is now assassinating and targeting anyone they suspect of joining the revolution or thinking of defecting			2
that may have been the case with @entity105 , " col. @entity102 told @entity0			0
@entity102 claims the regime " assassinated " the deputy head of the armed forces , gen. @entity107 , in september , even though state media reported that he died of an " acute heart attack			1
" at least 30 people were killed in @entity2 on saturday , including 12 in @entity113 , according to the @entity114 , a network of opposition activists			1
@entity113 , located in the country 's west , is @entity2 's third largest city			1
the @entity119 , another opposition group , put saturday 's toll at 46 , 32 of them civilians			1
over the past week , 687 people , including 59 children , have died , the @entity114 reported late saturday			1
about two - thirds of those occurred in @entity113			1
" today is the seventh day in a row we 're under shelling -- nonstop bombardment , " an activist named @entity126 said saturday			0
he said government forces have surrounded the area with thousands of soldiers and dozens of tanks : " not the normal tanks			0
" " we just want from @entity53 to give us permission to move the injured baby -- they are just the babies , " @entity126 said , referring to @entity53			0
" they have to leave the area to have a good treatment			0
... he do n't even let us save and treat our ( injured ) babies			0
" unrest rippled in the south as five men in the southern province of @entity153 were killed when a a tank attacked them in the town of @entity156 , @entity114 activist @entity148 said			1
they were among 13 people killed in @entity153 , where the government security crackdown and the nationwide uprising started in mid-march			1
funerals were held , meanwhile , for 39 members of the @entity2 army and law enforcement units			0
@entity15 said the officers were targeted while on duty near @entity21 and in @entity113			1
world leaders have tried to pass resolutions denouncing the regime 's bloody crackdown , but have been stymied by @entity138 and @entity171 in sending a unified message			2
almost a week after @entity138 and @entity171 vetoed a @entity175 resolution intended to stop the killing , @entity173 has drafted a similarly worded document -- but one that lacks the same punch			2
the @entity173 draft resolution will be submitted to the @entity180 , where vetoes are not allowed , but resolutions are not legally binding			0
the three - page draft " strongly condemns " the violations of human rights by @entity2 authorities			0
it cites " the use of force against civilians , arbitrary executions , killing and persecution of protesters , human rights defenders and journalists , arbitrary detention , enforced disappearances , interference with access to medical treatment , torture , sexual violence and ill - treatment , including against children			2
" the text was provided to @entity0 by a diplomatic source on the condition that it not be posted in full because it could be amended			0
the @entity180 will convene monday			0
both @entity138 and @entity171 , which have major trade ties with @entity2 , have said they support an end to the violence but disagreed with the text of the draft resolution they rejected last week			1
" we do believe that , in order to stop violence , armed methods must be stopped not only by the government , but also by the opposition , " said @entity138 's @entity175 ambassador , @entity215			1
" that was the key flaw of the draft resolution			0
" @entity0 can not independently confirm details of the fighting in @entity2 because the government has severely limited the access of international journalists			0
but virtually all reports from within the country indicate @entity53 's forces are slaughtering protesters and other civilians en masse			0
opposition activists in @entity113 describe relentless bomb explosions from @entity2 forces , wounded people bleeding to death in the streets because they ca n't get medical attention and snipers picking off civilians running for cover			1
@entity175 officials estimate 6,000 people have died since protests seeking @entity53 's ouster began nearly a year ago			2
the @entity114 says the toll has far exceeded 7,000			0
@entity250 's regime has insisted its crackdown is aimed at armed gangs and foreign terrorists bent on destabilizing the regime			2
but @entity256 ambassador to @entity2 @entity257 said the truth is obvious			0
" we know who 's shelling @entity113 , " he said			1
" it 's not the opposition , it 's the government			2
" @entity0 's @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and journalist @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
