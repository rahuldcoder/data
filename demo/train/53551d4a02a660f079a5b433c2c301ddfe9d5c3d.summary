-- @entity4 military forces conducted an operation monday in @entity6 against the @entity8 network , @entity2 press secretary rear adm. @entity1 said			1
here is a q&a that looks at the @entity12 - linked militant group : what is @entity8 and what are its aims ? @entity8 is a @entity6 group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the @entity4 government in march 2008			1
it is seeking to turn @entity6 into a fundamentalist @entity19 state , according to the @entity20			2
the group is believed to be responsible for attacks in @entity6 that have killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and @entity27 peacekeepers			1
it has struck abroad , too			0
it was responsible for the july 2010 suicide bombings in @entity31 , @entity32 , that killed more than 70 people , including a @entity4 citizen , as they gathered to watch a @entity37 final soccer match			2
how big is it ? the total size of the group is not clear			0
a @entity4 official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said in 2011 that @entity8 was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters in the country			1
a @entity47 report identifies one insurgent leader who is " believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters , " most of them @entity51			2
and it has links to other groups			0
in february 2012 , the group 's leader , @entity57 , and @entity12 leader @entity58 released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations			1
though @entity8 's size may be in doubt , its potential for sowing terror is not			2
" i would say that the greatest risks right now in @entity70 are @entity8 and the violent extremists that they represent , " said gen. @entity67 in 2011 , when he was commander of the @entity68			0
@entity8 's origins decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made @entity6 a target for radical @entity78 groups			1
@entity8 's predecessor was @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , which worked to create an @entity78 emirate in @entity6			1
it was , in part , funded by former @entity12 leader @entity83 , according to the @entity20			0
@entity80 , which the @entity84 designated as a terrorist organization , strengthened after the fall in 1991 of @entity88 's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued			1
in 2003 , a rift erupted between @entity92 's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members ( @entity8 , which means " the youth " ) , who were seeking to establish fundamental @entity19 rule			0
that led the latter to ally with a group of sharia courts -- the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city			1
working together , the @entity99 and @entity8 succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of @entity106			0
that sparked fears in neighboring @entity109 that violence would spill over there , according to the @entity20			0
those fears -- combined with a request from @entity6 's transitional government -- led @entity109 forces to enter @entity6 in december 2006 and to remove the @entity99 from power			2
that move proved to be a turning point , one that radicalized @entity8 , which attacked @entity109 forces and gained control of parts of central and southern @entity6 , according to a 2011 case study by @entity123 , who was then with the @entity124 at the @entity125			1
what is @entity8 's relationship with @entity51 ? in 2011 , the @entity51 government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern @entity6 after attacks on tourist destinations in northern @entity51 that it blamed on @entity8			1
more recently , @entity109 troops crossed the border and expelled @entity8 from @entity136 , a strategic town midway between the @entity109 border and @entity106			0
the group then targeted @entity27 soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks			0
a suicide bombing in march 2012 killed five people at the @entity145			0
analysts say tension appears to have been growing within @entity8 between @entity6 and foreign fighters , several hundred of whom are thought to have entered @entity6 in recent years to join the group			1
there may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in february 2012 of an alliance between @entity8 and @entity12 and about the group 's ban on foreign aid organizations working in @entity6 to save millions threatened by famine			1
how and from where does it recruit ? the organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a @entity166 account and video production abilities			0
a 2009 @entity8 video is as slickly produced as a reality tv show , complete with a hip - hop jihad voice and a startling message			2
" mortar by mortar , shell by shell , only going to stop when i send them to hell , " an unidentified voice raps on the video in @entity174			0
the video shows a man reported to have been @entity183 , a @entity4 citizen from @entity184			0
" away from your family , away from our friends , away from ice , candy bars , all those things is because we 're waiting to meet the enemy , " he says			0
but enemies -- and alliances -- can shift			0
@entity195 , whose real name is @entity183 , said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with @entity8 " regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy " and feared for his life			1
he was reported to have been killed in @entity6 by @entity8			1
@entity0 is not able to confirm the report			0
finding replacements may not be hard			0
sheikh @entity206 , a member of @entity208 's @entity6 community , said he knows of hundreds of young @entity6 men living in the @entity210 who returned to @entity6 for terrorist training			2
how is it funded ? the once - ragtag @entity6 - based @entity12 affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse , raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion , illegal taxation and other " fees , " according to the 2011 @entity47 report			1
the @entity4 believed then that the group was coordinating with @entity12 groups in @entity224 and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad			1
in 2011 , it was generating " between $ 70 million and $ 100 million per year , from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports , taxes on goods and services , taxes in kind on domestic produce , ' jihad contributions , ' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation , " according to the report from the @entity245 on @entity6 and @entity246			2
how have @entity6 been affected ? years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that @entity8 has not helped			1
in 2011 , the @entity47 declared a famine in the southern @entity6 regions of @entity252 and @entity253 , and @entity8 reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine - stricken areas			1
that year , the @entity258 for @entity259 announced that @entity6 had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world			2
a report jointly commissioned by the @entity47 @entity264 and the @entity266 - funded @entity265 reported that 258,000 @entity6 had died in the famine between october 2010 and april 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five			2
what is the @entity4 doing ? the @entity4 has supported @entity47 - backed @entity272 forces fighting @entity8 and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group			1
it has also donated millions in aid			0
what is the status of @entity6 's government today ? in september 2012 , @entity6 parliament members selected @entity280 as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation , which had not had a stable central government since @entity88 's overthrow 21 years before			1
that did not mean @entity8 was calling it quits			0
in january 2013 , @entity290 forces attempted to rescue a @entity290 intelligence commando held hostage in @entity6 by the group			2
the raid left the soldier dead , another soldier missing and 17 @entity78 fighters dead			0
but there has been political progress there			0
in january last year , for the first time in more than two decades , the @entity4 granted official recognition to the @entity6 government			1
@entity0 's @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 is an @entity12 - linked militant group based in @entity6
