obviously , many of us are on a quest for happiness			2
we all want , and deserve , that sense of well - being			2
achieving happiness is easier than you may think			2
we all experience emotional highs throughout our lives -- with a job promotion , on our wedding day , with the birth of a child			1
but these moments only yield temporary feelings of elation , and experts say that they alone are not enough to achieve true happiness			0
happiness is n't just an emotional state			0
decades of research proves it goes much deeper			0
in fact , science shows people who are happy live longer and healthier lives			1
the good news is that generating better bliss is something we can all do regardless of our environment or genetics			0
here are seven ways to boost your life satisfaction : start by changing your attitude			1
that 's right -- i 'm talking to you , pessimists			1
a @entity47 study found that optimists are not only happier but are 50 % less likely to have heart disease , a heart attack or a stroke			1
it turns out that keeping a positive outlook actually offers protection against cardiovascular disease			1
the science does n't fare as well for pessimists			1
they have lower levels of happiness compared with optimists and are three times as likely to develop health problems as they age , researchers say			1
learn from people who are already happy			1
@entity65 has earned the top spot on the @entity68 's " eurobarometer " for well - being and happiness every year since 1973			1
and when the @entity71 went on the hunt for the happiest nation in the world , it ranked @entity65 no. 1			1
so what makes @entity65 more satisfied with their lives ? sure , things like life expectancy , gross domestic product and a low - corruption rate help			1
but the overall level of happiness in @entity65 has more to do with the generosity that 's common among citizens , their freedom to make life choices and a strong social support system , according to the @entity88			1
@entity89 : the world 's happiest city work less			1
the @entity65 seem to strike a great work - life balance , which ups their happiness level			1
simply put : they do n't overwork			0
in fact , the average workweek in @entity65 is 33 hours -- only 2 % of @entity65 work more than 40 hours a week			1
almost 80 % of mothers in @entity65 return to work after having a child , but they balance their free time between families , weekly happy hour with their girlfriends and participating in community club programs			1
@entity65 also pay less attention to gadgets and things and more attention to building memories			1
studies show that people who focus on experiences over " things " have higher levels of satisfaction , long after the moment of the experience has passed			1
too much stuff tends often leads to debt , not to mention the time and stress associated with keeping up all those gadgets , cars , properties , clothes , etc. researchers say when people focus on experiences , they feel a greater sense of vitality or " being alive " during the experience and afterward			2
it also brings you mentally closer to the people around you , which may contribute to your happiness boost			2
build up your social network			0
by simply being social , you could slow down your biological age			0
research shows that a strong social support system can lengthen our telomeres			2
telomeres are the tiny caps on our dna chromosomes that indicate our cellular age			0
according to experts , no friends can equal shorter telomeres and , in turn , a shorter life			0
other studies have showed that loneliness leads to higher rates of depression , health problems and stress			0
solution : have at least one close friend to boost your happiness level and health			0
people who volunteer are happier with their lives than those who do n't , according to dozens of studies			1
the @entity71 even credits volunteerism as one of the reasons @entity65 is the happiest nation in the world -- 43 % of @entity65 regularly give back to their community , compared with 25 % of @entity0			1
the joy of helping others starts early			0
a 2012 study found children prefer to give than to receive			0
researchers gave two groups of toddlers snacks and then asked one group to give their treats away			0
the children who gave away their treats showed greater happiness about sharing their possessions , suggesting that the act of personal sacrifice was emotionally rewarding , researchers say			0
the sacrifice does n't have to be big -- previous research has found that donating or spending as little as $ 5 on others has emotional benefits			2
experts say we are all inherently compassionate			0
performing acts of kindness , volunteering time and donating money increases happiness by improving your sense of community , purpose and self - image			0
research shows that laughing does n't just signal happiness , it produces it			2
when we laugh , our stress hormones decrease and our endorphins rise			0
endorphins are the same brain chemicals associated with the " runner 's high " you get from exercise			0
live to 100 : laugh more @entity209 is also good for your heart			2
a study found that only 8 % of heart patients who were made to laugh daily had a second heart attack within a year , compared with 42 % of the non-laughers			0
studies show our bodies ca n't differentiate between fake and real laughter ; you 'll get the health boost either way			0
so you can even fake it until you make it			0
laugh in your car , in the shower -- force yourself to start laughing a few minutes every day .			2

science shows happy people live longer and healthier lives
