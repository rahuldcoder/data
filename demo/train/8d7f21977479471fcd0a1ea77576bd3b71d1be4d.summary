as questions continue to swirl about how to deal with the ever - growing fears of @entity6 , relatives of the first person to be diagnosed with the deadly virus in the @entity3 gathered to grieve saturday			1
wiping tears from their eyes , family and friends of @entity11 told @entity13 affiliate @entity12 he was a " compassionate and respectful young man			0
" as relatives said their final farewells to @entity11 , a @entity26 national and father of four , at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , they wanted him to be remembered for his acts of kindness , " as opposed to the person who brought this disease to @entity3 because he did n't know he was sick , " said nephew @entity23			1
@entity11 , 42 , died earlier this month at a hospital in @entity28			2
his mother and other relatives live in @entity20			0
this week , a @entity32 country closed its borders to anyone who has been anywhere near the disease			0
and an airline scrambled to inform hundreds passengers that they had been on a plane that carried someone who has since come down with @entity6			2
when @entity3 secretary of state @entity42 asked the government of @entity44 to help evacuate a @entity28 hospital worker from a cruise ship off its coast on friday , officials declined to let her on shore			1
the employee of @entity50 was a lab supervisor and did not have direct contact with @entity11 , who died there while being treated for @entity6			1
but she may have had contact with one of his specimens , the @entity53 said			2
a doctor on the carnival cruise ship has declared her symptom - free and in good health			1
still , the lab supervisor and a travel partner have undergone voluntary isolation as a precaution			1
@entity44 slaps travel , visa bans it 's been 20 days since she perhaps handled @entity11 's fluid samples -- the maximum incubation period for @entity6 is 21 days			1
meanwhile , on saturday , a @entity3 @entity71 confirms to @entity13 a @entity3 @entity71 helicopter flew to the carnival cruise , lowered a hoist basket , and picked up the lab technician 's blood samples			1
" the samples which are in a container , so the @entity71 members are not exposed , were then taken by @entity81 's on board doctor , " said petty officer @entity77 , @entity71 spokesman			1
" the test results are expected back , before the @entity84 arrives in @entity85 tomorrow morning , " said @entity77			0
" if results are n't ready , health officials will be at the port to make sure the woman is not showing any symptoms , before allowing her to get off the ship			2
" but as sure as it may seem that lab professional is @entity6 - free , the @entity53 wanted to fly her back to the @entity3 -- purely out of caution -- from @entity96 's airport			1
instead , the cruise ship is hauling her back to @entity85			1
on top of the no - go , @entity44 's government has slapped visa and travel bans this week on citizens of affected @entity104 countries and announced more strict measures			1
" also , any person of whatever nationality wishing to travel to @entity44 who has visited any affected area of @entity104 within the last 30 days will be prohibited from entering @entity44 , " the government said in a statement on friday			2
cruise ship passengers will be vetted before being allowed to go on land			1
who to review @entity6 response amid criticism airline worries leave no stone unturned is the approach @entity120 is taking , after a passenger came down with @entity6			2
it is telling up to 800 passengers to contact the @entity124			0
most of them were n't on flights with @entity128 , the second @entity28 nurse who contracted @entity6 after helping treat @entity11			1
@entity129 flew to @entity130 on october 10 and back to @entity28 on october 13			1
in an effort to further quarantine the deadly virus , the @entity132 @entity131 , upped the ante on specific @entity6 monitoring requirements on saturday for those potentially affected by the deadly virus			2
@entity132 health officials saturday increased the number of people being monitored from 16 to 29			0
these people were in the vicinity of @entity129 or had contact with her			0
they include people who were in a bridal shop she visited			0
one of them was a " close contact " and is under quarantine , according to @entity151			0
the new measures include daily health monitoring by a local health department official and those being monitored " can not leave the @entity3 due to the inability to track them down in the event they fail to meet their daily reporting requirements , " the statement read			1
" we 're taking an aggressive approach , no doubt about it , but it 's just common sense			0
some might criticize us for being too aggressive , but we 're comfortable taking that criticism , " said dr. @entity151 , state epidemiologist and interim chief of the @entity169 in statement			0
the @entity124 said she could have had symptoms during that time			0
the @entity173 says an officer who patted down @entity129 on october 13 in @entity130 has been placed on paid administrative leave " out of an abundance of caution			1
" " a @entity180 officer who conducted a routine pat - down of a traveler later reported to be infected with @entity6 consulted with the @entity124 , " the @entity173 said in a statement			1
" no @entity130 @entity173 officer came in direct contact with the infected traveler , as all pat downs are completed while employees are wearing disposable medical gloves , " the statement continued			1
the @entity173 holds firm that the employee is not reporting any symptoms and was instructed by @entity124 to self - monitor over the next few days , as a precautionary measure			1
@entity151 told reporters that 87 state residents in the flights were self - monitoring for symptoms of @entity6			2
the @entity124 would like people who were on either flight to get in touch with them to answer some questions and potentially undergo monitoring , although it says the risk to anyone was extremely low			0
but @entity120 , as an extra precaution , included anyone who had been on subsequent flights that used the same plane as the one on her return flight			0
@entity120 has also taken that plane out of service			0
@entity132 gov. @entity210 went so far on saturday as calling for a travel ban for countries affected by the deadly @entity6 outbreak			2
no @entity132 airport currently has direct flights to or from the affected nations in @entity104			0
" i would say i think it makes sense to have ( a ) ban in place , " he told reporters			0
" the @entity223 has to make that call			0
he has to listen to many different people			0
and i have no doubt in my mind they 're considering this now			0
" can you catch @entity6 on a plane ?			2

@entity173 officer who patted down @entity6 **patient** @entity128 in @entity130 is now watching for symptoms
