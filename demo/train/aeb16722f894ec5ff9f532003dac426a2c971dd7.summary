@entity0 -- @entity4 government experts trying to construct a model of radiation plumes emanating from @entity9 's @entity8 power plant are being hampered by a " paucity of good data , " a senior administration official told @entity1			1
" we have done some ( computer ) modeling , " the official said , noting the government " got a little bit of data " when helicopters from the @entity16 encountered low levels of radiation during flights in the area			1
but information has been scant , the official said , adding , " garbage in , garbage out			0
" the official spoke on background because he was not authorized to speak publicly			0
experts use computer models of plumes to both track radioactivity or other harmful releases and predict their paths			1
@entity4 officials as well as industry officials and critics say radiation from @entity8 will not pose a significant health threat to the @entity4			1
but plumes could be a factor in causing flight and maritime restrictions			0
the official said the @entity4 is sending 39 people and 17,200 pounds of equipment to @entity9 to assist in efforts to bring the reactors under control			1
among the gear is aerial measuring capability to provide radiation readings			0
he stressed the importance of getting " boots on the ground " to get good data			1
from the first hours of the incident , the president 's chief homeland security adviser , @entity56 , along with personnel from the @entity59 , the @entity60 and other agencies have been maintaining close contacts " as best we could " with people on the ground in @entity9 , the official said			2
officials have been drawing on a variety of sources for information , including both official and personal contacts in @entity9 , and open - source material , such as public statements from the @entity9 government and @entity76 web sites			2
at the @entity59 , a nuclear incident team has been monitoring developments around the clock , he said			0
but data has been hard to come by , and there are " conflicting reports " about damage in some of the reactors , the official said			2
" there 's a lot of genuine confusion about what is going on , " he said			1
@entity4 officials also still do not know what caused the fire in @entity93 at the @entity8 plant			0
there is concern that fuel rods in a spent fuel storage pool may have been exposed			0
that fire reportedly burned for two hours before being extinguished .			0

data is scare on radioactivity coming from @entity9 's damaged reactors
experts need good data in building computer models to track radioactivity
official : " there 's a lot of genuine confusion about what is going on "
experts say radiation from @entity9 does not pose a significant health threat to the @entity4
