-- @entity2 defense secretary @entity1 said sunday that @entity2 forces can " deal with any potential contingencies " in the @entity4 , especially after the military 's capabilities were recently " enhanced " after attacks on @entity2 diplomatic missions			1
speaking to reporters en route to @entity12 , @entity1 said recent unrest underscores the importance of having vibrant , flexible @entity2 military capabilities in the region			1
that unrest includes an attack on the @entity2 @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , that killed @entity2 ambassador @entity21 and three other @entity2 , as well as violent protests near @entity2 embassies in @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and elsewhere			1
" the events of this week remind all of us of the need to maintain a strong presence in the @entity4 , " @entity1 said			1
more arrests in @entity2 consulate attack in @entity20 some of that comes from @entity2 forces ' extensive roots in the region , including bases in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and elsewhere			1
those troops make it easier to respond to crises in the region , which @entity1 acknowledged , as do other recent moves , which include calling on members of small @entity49 , or @entity50 , teams and moving warships in the region			2
" we have enhanced some of that presence with the @entity50 teams and others so that , if they are requested , they can respond more quickly , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's a combination of @entity50 teams plus some ships in the region that we have to try to give us the full capability we need in order to respond , " he added , while noting the did n't " anticipate a situation right now where we would have to ... do this on our own			0
" earlier this week , vigorous and sometimes violent protests broke out near @entity2 embassies around the world over the " @entity69 , " an obscure film mocking the @entity71 as a womanizer , child molester and ruthless killer			0
two months after the film 's trailer was posted online on @entity79 , and days after it got attention in @entity24 media , @entity76 residents first expressed their ire tuesday , the 11th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , with protests targeting the @entity2 embassy			0
@entity86 soon spread like wildfire across the @entity89 world			0
as a result , @entity91 diplomats found themselves and their missions under siege , even as @entity2 leaders criticized the film and emphasized the @entity2 government had nothing to do with it			0
afterward , @entity2 officials said @entity49 fast teams , with about 50 members each , were being dispatched to @entity20 , @entity102 and @entity25 to protect @entity2 diplomatic missions in those countries			1
but @entity102 officials rebuffed the @entity2 plan to send in troops , insisting their own security forces could protect the @entity109 in @entity110			0
and @entity25 's parliament issued a statement early sunday vehemently opposing the presence of @entity2 troops in the country			0
one nation that has n't voiced opposition to a small contingent of @entity2 troops is @entity20			2
@entity20 officials have said they are cooperating closely with @entity2 authorities in investigating tuesday 's attack in @entity19 , which they have strongly condemned			1
" i 'm convinced that they want to do everything possible to be able to respond to what happened there , " @entity1 said of @entity20 officials			1
" and i think they are taking steps on the security side to provide better security			0
... i think they are making a strong effort to try to respond to this crisis and try to deal with the issues involved			2
" @entity134 calls for new film protests			0
