-- " it was an angry call , " @entity0 said of the now - infamous phone call in which @entity4 lambasted him for " @entity5 " poking fun at the fact that " @entity10 " went live during the 2007 writers ' strike , " and suffice it to say , he is a phenomenally good debater , if you had been keeping score , i would have lost roundly			1
" the creator of " @entity5 , " " @entity16 ! " and " @entity17 " is a guest on tonight 's " @entity18			1
" " i was really kind of in shock more than anything else , " said @entity19			2
it was kind of an odd @entity24 moment			0
i was a huge fan of his show , and here i was getting this angry phone call			0
" @entity19 told @entity29 that he still maintains the standpoint that @entity4 , " arguably the most popular , successful television personality in the genre , " ought to have stood up for " the people who have n't made it yet			1
" he said that @entity4 asked him who 'd made him " the moral arbiter of @entity24			2
" when @entity29 pointed out the irony in @entity4 calling out @entity19 for mocking him , @entity19 joked			1
" if i say yes , he 's going to crucify me on his show every night for a year			0
" @entity19 summed up the incident by telling @entity29 that while he stands firm in his opinion that @entity4 ought to have shut " @entity10 " down during the strike , the " @entity5 " gag " was probably so over the line in its ruthlessness that it probably could have been more measured in its execution			1
" when @entity29 asked where his darkly hilarious , absurd , slightly sinister brand of humor comes from , @entity19 said " a lot of people in my family have very dark , very twisted senses of humor that i was exposed to at a very young age			1
" @entity19 was very close to his mother , @entity19 , whom he called " invaluable " to his comedy career , calling her sense of humor " wickedly vicious			1
" @entity19 , who lost his mother to cancer last year , told @entity29 " there was really nothing on ' @entity5 ' or any of the other shows that could offend her , " said @entity19			1
when @entity29 pointed out that " @entity5 " has poked fun at paraplegics , multiple religions , pedophiles , @entity71 , and did an opera version of the @entity74 murder , among many other controversial topics , @entity66 maintained that his mother remained " unflappable , " stating that " there was really nothing that fazed her " and that she herself had told her son stories about her past , " none of which i can repeat on the air , that shocked the hell out of me			1
" @entity19 called the fact that he was never able to shock his mother the reason was such a valuable resource			1
when it comes to what is and is n't off limits on his shows , @entity19 told @entity29 that he trusts his gut -- and the opinions of his team of writers , telling @entity29 that they are " very smart , very conscientious people who are aware of what is funny and what is going to be over the line			2
" citing " @entity103 " as one of his influences , @entity19 called prime - time animation a great forum for satirical humor , calling it the televised translation of politic cartoons found in " @entity109			1
" @entity19 told @entity29 " if we 're wrong about something , we have a table read , where we read the script aloud for the network , for the studio , for each other , for the animators			2
and we get a lot of groans if something 's over the line at that point			0
and if we make it past that point , there 's always broadcast standards who , in @entity128 's case , are actually very reasonable people who genuinely care about the comedy as much as they care about not getting the network fined			0
" @entity19 told @entity29 that comedy is often an edgy , cutting , dark medium and that " @entity5 " does n't veer away from poking fun , even at 9/11			1
" it always has to be funny , " he said			0
" if we 're ever getting preachy or soapboxy then we 're not really doing our jobs , and there have been times that we have gotten preachy and soapboxy , and that 's us not really working as hard as we should			0
" @entity19 himself had been booked on @entity143 from @entity144 to @entity145 -- the plane that hit the @entity147 of the @entity148 on september 11 , 2001			1
@entity19 told @entity29 that he 'd given a lecture at his alma mater , @entity150 , the night before and went out with some faculty members afterward and " had a few pints			2
" due to the combination of being hung over and having been mistakenly told by his travel agent that the flight was set to takeoff 10 minutes later than it did , @entity19 arrived just after the gate closed			2
@entity19 exchanged his ticket for a late - morning flight , dozed off in the lounge and woke up to the commotion surrounding the news that a plane had hit the @entity147 of the @entity148			2
as the crowd gathered in the airport lounge watching the horror unfold , it was announced what flight it was			0
" and i turned to the guy next to me , said @entity19			0
" and said , ' my @entity171 ! that was the flight i was supposed to be on			0
' " @entity19 recalled a " wonderful unity " among the people in the airport that morning " that we 've since completely abandoned , " recalling how the lounge bartender poured him a shot upon hearing that @entity19 was supposed to have been on @entity143			1
" that feeling that must have been what , you know , our grandparents felt during @entity186 where , you know , this is -- in that moment , everything was -- we -- we 're all the same , " said @entity19			0
@entity19 did tell @entity29 , " i 'm not a fatalist , " and admitted that the event , which was arguably a twist of fate for him , did n't shake him up the way it might others , because he habitually misses flights			0
" a day before that incident , i could have been crossing the street five minutes earlier and gotten hit by a car and never known that i just missed it , " he said			0

@entity0 angered @entity4 by *parodying* him on " @entity5 "
@entity19 says twisted sense of humor comes from family , namely his " unflappable " mother
