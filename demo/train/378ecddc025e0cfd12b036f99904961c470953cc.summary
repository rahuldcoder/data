-- in his @entity2 - nominated role as @entity4 in @entity5 : @entity6 , @entity7 played a ruthless , murderous mob boss with a violent temper			1
but this week the @entity11 star is doing his shooting on the golf course			2
and the @entity15 family will have to accept that every score he brings in at the @entity17 will go to charity			1
the @entity5 , it appears , has gone legit			2
" i love to golf , " @entity7 told @entity0			1
" i get out once a week and play with guys like @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			2
i just turn up and play with whoever 's waiting to go			2
it 's a great way of meeting people and being sociable			2
" the 54 - year - old actor will be joining the likes of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 at the tournament in @entity34 this week , which sees celebrities paired with professional golfers in the name of charity			1
@entity7 has been a regular at the @entity40 event since 1996 , and the 11 - handicapper would n't miss it			1
" the @entity43 shine on that tournament			1
it 's the absolute pinnacle of what you can experience as an amateur golfer , " @entity7 said			1
" we play three courses , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity17			1
they all run along the ocean and the scenery is extraordinary			2
then there 's the atmosphere , which is pretty unique to golf			0
" there 's also a lot of amazing work done for charity			1
on wednesday we have a five - hole scramble and whatever we win goes to the charity of our choice			1
@entity30 ( @entity65 ) and i won it one year			2
" the tournament has raised over $ 85 million for the @entity69 since it was launched by @entity11 legend @entity70 in 1937 -- with the funds distributed as grants to non-profit organizations across @entity74			1
for @entity7 , the opportunity to play alongside the world 's best golfers is considered an honor and a privilege			1
but that @entity5 ambition still burns beneath the surface			0
" of course you want to be competitive , " he said			0
" @entity84 and i won the tournament back in 1997 ( best combined pro-am total )			1
i think the golfing gods touched us that year			0
" it 's also a great place to pick up tips			0
you 're hitting balls out of a practice bunker and you 've got all these guys around you who can help you out			0
you 're on the tee and suddenly @entity98 is hitting a drive right next to you			0
" @entity7 's love affair with golf began in his childhood , inspired by the likes of @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
he remembers jumping the fence to steal a few holes in while the sprinklers were still running at a course near his @entity112 home			0
but the @entity115 - born actor turned his attentions to other sports at high school , and it was n't until his early 30s that he returned to give the game his full attention			2
" i 'm a member at @entity121 in @entity122 now , the course where @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity70 and guys like that used to play , " he said			0
" i try to play once a week			0
but when the days get lighter i 'll sometimes get out for nine holes in the evenings too			0
i 'd love to play more if i had the time			0
i 'm still pretty inconsistent			0
one day i play well , the next i do n't			0
" @entity7 's film credits include @entity131 , when a man loves a woman and @entity134 , and he 's made his name in @entity11 as one of the coolest cats in the business			1
but even @entity140 @entity11 superstars get nervous on the golf course			0
" the acting experience helps you focus , and i 'm used to the crowds , but i still get those jitters on the first tee at @entity17 , " he said			1
" i do n't command a game of golf like i do a scene in a movie			0
