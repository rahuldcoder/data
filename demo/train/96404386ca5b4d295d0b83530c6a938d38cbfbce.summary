if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , the old adage goes			0

@entity2 will launch the @entity11 range , a revamped version of @entity5 airliner , the company announced monday at the 2014 @entity14 held in @entity15			1
the new wide - body planes will compete with @entity18 's @entity17			1

@entity2 has sold more than 1,300 a330 airplanes to nearly 100 customers worldwide , making it one of the most successful aircraft in the wide - body category , @entity19 said			1
" what we are doing is making this aircraft , which is already great , better , " he said			0
the newly launched @entity5 - 800neo and the @entity5 - 900neo ( enhanced versions of the @entity5 and @entity5 -- 300 models , respectively ) will feature several new features , according to @entity2 , not the least of which is a vast improvement in fuel efficiency			1
with the help of new @entity41 7000 engines , an 800 kilograms reduction in weight of the aircraft , and a new aerodynamic design featuring a 64 meters wingspan and curved wingtips , the new airliner will see a 14 % reduction in fuel consumption per seat			0
" we enjoy very good sales of the @entity5 , but we were listening to our customers			2
people were telling us , your aircraft is fantastic , but would be even more fantastic if you could achieve a better level of fuel burn , " @entity52 , president and ceo of @entity2 , told @entity54			2
