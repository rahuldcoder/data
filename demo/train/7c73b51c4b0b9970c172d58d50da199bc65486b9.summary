@entity0 , @entity1 -- in one spot , a moderate @entity4 congressman is portrayed as a demon sheep -- a threat to the @entity4 flock			1
in another ad , a candidate for governor declares to viewers , " i 'm one tough nerd ! " and , of course , there 's the now - infamous " i am not a witch " spot			1
these are among the most talked - about campaign commercials and videos of this political season			1
and they 're all brought to you by @entity4 producer @entity24			1
his secret to a winning ad ? " to me , it has to stand out			2
and you have to talk about it , " an excited @entity24 said			1
" it has to be different			2
" standing out seems to be a way of life for the ad man			1
take his office : it 's a three - story house in the @entity36 , where he is surrounded by @entity0 liberals			2
his place is filled with odd artifacts , including a two - headed calf perched next to a trove of awards			2
@entity24 did sen. @entity45 's media work in the 2008 campaign , which included the @entity47			1
connect the dots , and , yes , he helped introduce @entity49 to the nation			2
this year , he helped @entity45 pull through a hard - fought primary with a commercial that featured the candidate walking along the @entity56 - @entity55 border , telling a sheriff it 's time to " build the danged fence			2
" @entity24 also produced the memorable @entity61 spot in which the former vice president 's baby - faced son -- who is running for @entity64 in @entity65 -- looked into the camera and declared , " @entity67 is the worst president in history			1
" but the ad that will probably be talked about for years to come is the first spot for @entity72 senatorial candidate @entity71			2
the relative unknown had n't aired a single commercial and was being parodied on late - night tv for saying , years ago , that she dabbled in witchcraft			1
@entity24 decided that rather than ignore the controversy , @entity71 should take on the comics and critics directly			1
in her first commercial out of the gate , @entity71 announced to viewers , " i am not a witch			1
" " my goal was to give people the same impression of @entity71 that i had the first second that i met her , " @entity24 said			1
" she did n't sound crazy			2
she did n't sound like a witch			1
she did n't sound like any of those things , and i wanted the rest of the world to hear that as well			1
" the commercial itself was parodied on late - night television			0
@entity71 recently said she regretted revisiting the issue because it renewed the controversy			0
though these days , critics are no longer calling @entity71 a witch			1
@entity24 does not shy away from controversy			1
he thinks he 'll be best known for a video that went viral after it aired during the @entity1 @entity4 convention			0
the video , for @entity107 senatorial candidate @entity106 , featured her @entity4 opponent -- a moderate -- as a wolf dressed as a sheep , with devilish , glowing red eyes			1
playing to primary voters ' desire for ideological purity , the spot declared @entity117 a rino : @entity4			0
you would n't be here if it were n't for the demon sheep			1
@entity120 sheep was a nothing			2
i never in a million years would have guessed it would [ have ] happened , " @entity24 recounted			1
he says he got the idea when @entity106 's campaign manager said he wanted to convince voters that @entity117 was n't the fiscal expert he claimed to be			0
@entity24 recalled , " i 'm thinking sheep			1
and i 'm thinking , what is it ? wolf in sheep 's clothing ! and one thing led to another , and it was a very cheap little video			2
i did n't think five people would ever see it			0
and millions have seen it , and the rest of my life i will be introduced as the demon sheep guy			1
" like many of his ideas , he says , that one just came to him			0
he adds that often , his best ideas come in the middle of the night			0
" i sleep with a legal pad every night			0
i am very exciting , " he deadpanned			0
@entity24 , who also makes non-political ads , is not getting much sleep in the final days of the campaigns			1
his relatively small company of about a dozen full - time staff has offices in @entity0 ; @entity157 , @entity158 ; and @entity159			0
he is working simultaneously this cycle for about eight campaigns and is helping on others through the @entity163 and a couple of third - party groups			0
@entity24 strives to make a personal connection between the candidate and the audience			1
" you know what i try to do ? i try to really like my clients			2
and if i really like them , i try to think			0
you mentioned @entity106 [ @entity106 ]			0
what is it i like about @entity106 ? well , she 's fun , she 's positive , she 's up , she 's chipper , and so i try to impart those feelings about her , " he said			0
" the pieces i like , i figured , if i come to like them , i can help somebody else find those same characteristics , and maybe they 'll like them too			0
so it 's not always 100 percent issue - based			0
" he knows his work does n't sit well with all viewers			2
" i get criticized every day of my life for something , " he said with a laugh			1
does he ever worry that his work goes too far outside the box ? " that does cross my mind			2
most people must think that it does not			0
and that i 'll do anything to get attention			0
" in his analysis , @entity56 is generally divided into two halves , or boxes : the @entity4 half and the " dim half			0
" " if you do something really well for this box , this box is going to hate it			0
if you do something really well for this box , this box is going to hate it , " he summarized			0
" so i expect , anticipate and enjoy and look forward to enormous criticism over something like demon sheep , because that helps me know that it 's probably doing its job with this box where i am trying to do it			1
if i do something and the wrong box is energized , then that 's a problem			0
and i have to fix it			0
" but that has n't happened yet			0
" no , not yet			0
