@entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 , was pulled off a plane in @entity14			1
he has been detained ever since			0
his wife , @entity16 , said she would like to remind authorities in @entity4 that @entity10 has been held for 30 days			1
" we need to have @entity19 back at the head of the table for the holidays			0
and we ask -- respectfully -- for them to release him and let him come home , " she told @entity0 's @entity23			1
asked what she would like to tell her husband , @entity27 said simply : " we 're missing you , and we want you home			1
" @entity32 does not have diplomatic relations with @entity14 , and it has been working through @entity34 -- the @entity3 protecting power in @entity4 -- to obtain information about the @entity3			1
" we 've had talks with the @entity38 , regular conversations since the detention			0
i think they 've been working very hard to secure the release , to establish sufficient communications to get some feedback			0
but at this point , we do n't think there 's been any official feedback , " said @entity10 's son , @entity46			2
" the @entity34 consulate , which would be the first touch point , has n't had any contact with him and that 's what we need to know -- if nothing else to just establish his well - being and the fact that he 's getting his medication			0
" the family has said @entity10 suffers from a heart condition and only had enough medication for the trip			2
they have sent packages of medication but do not know whether he has received them			0
@entity10 , a @entity66 veteran and retired financial consultant , was last seen aboard a flight from @entity14 to @entity69			1
just minutes before the plane was to depart , he was removed from the flight by @entity4 authorities			1
according to his family , he had been on a 10 - day organized private tour of @entity4			2
from phone calls and postcards he sent , the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem , his son said			0
" we just want nothing more than to have this misunderstanding put behind us , " @entity82 told @entity23			0
" the right thing to do would be to put him on a plane and let him come back and join his family that loves him and misses him in @entity12			2
" @entity10 is one of two @entity3 citizens being held in @entity4			1
the other one , @entity90 , was arrested in november 2012 and sentenced in may to 15 years of hard labor			0
the @entity4 government has said he was found guilty of " hostile acts " and attempts to topple the government			2
@entity4 has not publicly said why it is holding @entity10			1
among the possibilities is his military service			0
he served as an @entity100 infantry officer during the @entity66 , which saw @entity4 fight @entity101 , the @entity3 and the @entity102 between 1950 and 1953			2
an armistice signed in 1953 ended the three - year war between @entity4 and @entity101			0
the two sides technically remain at war			0
" his time that he spent in the service was an important part of his life as a young man , and he was , i think , trying to put closure on that , " said @entity10 's wife			2
" he always has had an interest in the world , a respect for the @entity4 people , and he was looking forward to this as an opportunity to see the country -- for whatever opportunity he might have to see the people -- and to come back with a sense of comfort on having completed that circle			0
" it is also possible @entity4 authorities mistook him for another @entity10 , a @entity66 veteran awarded the @entity131 for valor in combat			1
@entity4 authorities are known to routinely run background checks on foreigners , travel agencies warn potential visitors			0
news of the detention came as talks were under way between the @entity3 and @entity142 , @entity4 's closest ally , about reviving negotiations to dismantle @entity14 's nuclear program			1
the timing raises questions about whether @entity4 plans to use @entity10 as a bargaining chip in the negotiations , a move the @entity151 has previously accused it of using to try to gain concessions from negotiations .			1
