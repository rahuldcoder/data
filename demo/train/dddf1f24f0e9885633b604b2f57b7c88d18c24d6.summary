on july 4 , 2010 , pope @entity0 traveled to @entity1 for his second visit to venerate the relics of his long - ago predecessor , @entity0 and @entity5 , who died in 1296			1
few predicted then that just a few years later , @entity0 and @entity6 would be locked together in history as the two popes who retired , theoretically voluntarily , because of their age			1
here is what @entity19 wrote : " we , @entity6 , @entity22 , moved by legitimate reasons , that is to say for the sake of humility , of a better life and an unspotted conscience , of weakness of body and of want of knowledge , the malignity of the people , and personal infirmity , to recover the tranquility and consolation of our former life , do freely and voluntarily resign the pontificate			1
" compare that to @entity0 's statement : " in today 's world , subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith , in order to govern the bark of @entity43 and proclaim the @entity44 , both strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months , has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me			1
for this reason , and well aware of the seriousness of this act , with full freedom i declare that i renounce the ministry of @entity57 , @entity58			0
" when pope @entity0 went to write his letter of resignation , there can be little doubt that he turned to @entity19 's example , the " papal bull " ( official letter ) from 1294 that affirmed the right of the pope to resign and the legal canons that followed codifying the practice			1
for the @entity73 , those 13th - century words stand as relevant and legally valid			0
@entity19 was an interesting fellow , and his life , short papacy and long legacy offer some examples for us as we absorb the surprise of @entity0 's resignation			1
@entity81 : why pope will be remembered for generations @entity19 himself had quite the surprise in july of 1294 , when a group of religious and lay @entity73 ascended to his mountain retreat and informed him that the @entity88 had just unanimously elected him as the new pope			2
@entity19 , born @entity90 , was a @entity92 ascetic who spent most of his religious life seeking isolation as a hermit in @entity97 , but he emerged as a consensus candidate when the cardinals could not agree on any of the usual suspects			0
the choice was a disaster			0
@entity103 of @entity104 ( and @entity105 ) , a powerful ruler of the era , tried to use him as a pawn to gain legitimacy over @entity110			0
@entity19 created new cardinals without due process , gave the same title to multiple people and in general seemed to have trouble saying no. elected in july at 79 and crowned in august , he resigned the papacy in december			1
ten days later , his chief lawyer and likely author of the new papal bull permitting resignation , @entity122 , became pope @entity123 eventually imprisoned the now ex-pope @entity6 and kept him under close watch until he died two years later			2
@entity19 's legacy , in some ways , became even more interesting than his life			2
@entity123 spent his early career undoing all of @entity6 's acts and trying to restore the papacy to political prominence			1
but within a few years of @entity123 's death in 1303 , pope @entity132 , his successor , moved the papacy to @entity134 , @entity135 , repudiated @entity123 and quickly began canonization proceedings for the soon - to - be @entity6			1
what does this have to do with @entity0 ? did his two visits to @entity19 's tomb and words of admiration for the saint , hermit and pontiff convey a secret message that @entity0 was contemplating retirement ? are the parallels even stronger than @entity19 and @entity0 being the two popes to resign on account of age ? historians regard @entity6 's claim of " personal infirmity " with considerable skepticism , focusing instead on " the malignity of the people " and pressure from his eventual successor as the real reason for his unprecedented resignation			1
opinion : huge challenges await next pope for @entity0 , the line , " shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith " stands out to me			2
what are these questions of deep relevance ? @entity0 was speaking of a shaken world ( the @entity175 version makes this clear ) , but is he perhaps shaken too by his time on the throne of @entity43 ? each reader may well imprint his or her own issues onto the mind of the aging pope			2
is he concerned about the ongoing , devastating revelations about pedophilia in the @entity73 and related coverups ? the " @entity189 " scandal and the corruption it alleges ? does he just believe that the @entity73 will need new leadership to face the challenges ahead ? or are his concerns more personal ? like @entity6 , is he seeking " tranquility " and a quiet path to his final days ? i doubt we 'll ever know more than we do right now			2
pope @entity0 's legacy is likely to be heavily contested in the years to come			1
particularly since his election , @entity0 has stood as the symbol on which those discontented with the direction of the church focus on their ire			0
others , concerned about the changes of @entity207 -- the council convened in 1962 that transformed so many @entity73 practices -- see in the current pope and his allies an attempt to restore the older , traditional church that they love			0
@entity19 's legacy , likewise , depended very much on the eye of the beholder			0
@entity218 revered him , seeing him in a true divine pontiff in contrast to the infernal anti-popes that followed			0
@entity222 , the great @entity223 poet , took a neutral stance , suggesting that @entity19 was just embracing his true gifts of solitary contemplation			0
@entity228 , on the other hand , condemned @entity6 for his cowardice , writing , " che fece per viltade il gran rifiuto / who made through cowardice the great refusal			0
" ( @entity228 , @entity233 , @entity234 60 )			0
how will our poets , prophets and people come to see pope @entity0 's resignation ? to even begin to answer that , we will need to see who emerges from the basilica when the white smoke rises above @entity245 .			1

@entity247 : pope @entity5 , from 1296 , and pope @entity0 both resigned
he says @entity0 likely turned to example of @entity19 , who codified pope 's right to resign
does @entity6 's reference to " malignity " of people find echo in @entity0 's resignation letter ?
@entity247 : some guess pope is *fleeing* scandal - *plagued* church ; others think he seeks tranquility
