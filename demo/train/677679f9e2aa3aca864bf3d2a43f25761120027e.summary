-- after a fine display against @entity3 in the @entity4 , @entity1 could n't back it up in @entity6			1
combined with @entity9 's victory , it means @entity1 was knocked off top spot in @entity11			1
@entity1 suffered just its third league loss of the campaign when it was beaten 3 - 1 at @entity14 , with manager @entity15 sent off for complaining to the referee			1
when @entity18 equalized in the 36th minute , most everyone must have thought @entity1 would go on to claim all three points			1
but two goals in a five - minute spell early in the second half handed @entity14 -- now unbeaten in four games -- all three points			1
for once @entity1 failed to convert its possession -- 65 percent -- to goals and midfielder @entity24 admitted @entity14 was the better side			1
" @entity9 played really well , " @entity24 told @entity1 's website			1
" they were better than us , we were always trailing them			0
" i do n't know if this is a step back , but the feelings after the match are n't good			0
we did n't interpret the game like we were supposed to , and we paid for it			0
@entity9 had a better approach			1
" this defeat should n't make us give up			2
we have to work hard and turn this situation around			0
there are many points left , and we have games against direct rivals			0
" @entity45 can join city rival @entity9 atop the standings and on 63 points , three more than @entity1 , if it wins sunday			1
@entity1 defender @entity48 was n't too concerned , though			2
" we 're just one game off being league leaders so it 's not too troubling , " he said			2
" these things can happen			0
when you attack it 's possible for them to score			2
sometimes you do n't feel comfortable on the pitch			0
" @entity57 served the third game of his three - game suspension for @entity9 but it did n't stop @entity9 from easing past @entity60 3 - 0 at home			1
@entity62 , who has struggled since moving to @entity11 from @entity64 's @entity63 , scored his team 's second goal with a long - range effort into the top corner			1
" @entity62 did n't have confidence before scoring his great goal and after that he was totally different , " @entity9 manager @entity69 told reporters			1
" i am satisfied because we did n't concede			0
our play could have been better but at this stage of the season we need to be solid and we were			0
" @entity79 stunner @entity79 escaped the relegation zone in @entity81 in style , thumping fading @entity83 3 - 0 at home in @entity86 's debut			1
@entity86 replaced @entity88 @entity87 , who was sacked after @entity79 lost seven straight in the @entity89			2
@entity90 scored one of the goals of the season when he shot past keeper @entity95 from near the halfway mark -- on a free kick			0
" i practice ( free kicks ) every single day , " the @entity100 under - 20 international told the league 's website			2
" if you do n't , then you lose or forget your shooting technique			0
that 's why i knew i could do it			0
i just thought to myself , ' @entity106 and hit it like in training			0
' " it was the best goal of my career			0
" @entity110 scored two goals a minute apart in the second half to down last - place @entity113 but the game was notable for this : three penalties were missed , a first in @entity89 history			0
@entity119 's 3 - 1 loss to @entity120 meant idle @entity121 maintained its hefty 16 - point lead in first			1
in @entity124 , @entity123 moved to within six points of leader @entity126 with a 1 - 0 win at relegation threatened @entity130 .			2

@entity1 suffers a rare defeat in @entity11 , losing at @entity14
@entity18 scores for @entity1 but it 's not enough to prevent a 3 - 1 reverse
@entity9 *leapfrogs* @entity1 after *coasting* past @entity60
in @entity81 , a wonder goal helps @entity79 sink @entity83
