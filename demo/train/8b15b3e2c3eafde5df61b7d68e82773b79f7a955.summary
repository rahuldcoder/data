" i have here in my hand a list of 205 communists ... " the ghost of @entity7 's ulcerous accusations hung over a disturbingly casual comment this past week by @entity10 rep. @entity9 , @entity11			1
when asked by a constituent at a town hall , " what percentage of the @entity10 legislature do you think are card - carrying @entity17 ? " " that 's a fair question , " @entity9 replied			1
" i believe there 's about 78 to 81 members of the @entity21 that are members of the @entity23			1
" keep in mind that this is the man @entity26 recently recommended be @entity28 's vice presidential nominee			1
and not only did @entity9 not apologize -- or receive significant criticism from his fellow @entity30 -- his revealing response was to raise funds off it			1
the number @entity9 picked out was apparently based on the number of congressmen affiliated with the @entity37			1
this is an organization of the most liberal members of @entity40 , but to call them communists is a slander splashed with blood			1
communists , of course , murdered more than 100 million people in the past century , if you add up the rough total of butchery by @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , @entity53 ( @entity52 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 ) and @entity56 ( @entity57 )			2
this is the reason people were understandably offended at @entity62 manager @entity61 's recent comments professing admiration for @entity65 communist dictator @entity64			2
but there were no widespread protests or requests for censure in @entity9 's case			1
instead it was greeted as an almost unremarkable part of the new normal			0
a military man of @entity75 's rank understands the magnitude of his misstatement			2
so i 'm assuming that he was sincere in the accusation			0
to equate liberals in @entity40 with communists is like equating conservatives in @entity40 with fascists -- something only the most brain - dead occupy protester would attempt			1
and just for a moment imagine if a liberal member of @entity40 made an equal and opposite accusation , saying that all the members of the tea party caucus were nazis			0
it would be rightly greeted with wall - to - wall outrage			0
but the asymmetric polarization of our politics has made such accusations within the easy reach of politically successful ideologues at unguarded moments			0
@entity9 's comments were simply extensions of @entity10 rep. @entity102 's infamous statement in 2008 about how then - candidate @entity103 -- and many @entity21 members of @entity40 -- held " anti-american views			1
" they really believe this stuff : anyone who is not avowedly conservative is considered liberal -- and therefore anyone who is avowedly liberal is considered communist			0
this is not a little insane			0
it is this logic also that allows conservative activists to paint @entity103 as socialist or communist			0
anything even slightly left of center is immediately seen as extreme			1
thereby ideas embraced by @entity30 even a decade ago -- such as the individual mandate to buy health insurance -- are now seen as radical and a clear attempt to undermine the @entity124 and replace freedom with socialism			1
this is what happens when politics starts looking like a cult with litmus tests and loyalty oaths and periodic purges of anyone who dissents			0
perspective is the first thing abandoned			0
and when a member of your " team " says something extreme , it is either ignored or excused by invoking extreme statements from the other side of the ideological gulf -- therefore the conservative response to @entity146 calling @entity147 a slut was to try and make the debate about @entity151 's past statements about @entity26			1
an insensitive but not entirely inaccurate statement by liberal pundit @entity153 is suddenly seen as serving as a surrogate for the @entity103 campaign despite their immediate denunciations of it			0
extending this logic , @entity28 will be held that responsible for anything extreme conservative talking heads say in this campaign			2
fundraising off extreme statements is just the latest innovation -- something even more cynical than anything @entity7 might have tried			2
at least for now , @entity9 is not a new @entity7			1
he 's not a fearful force , but a fringe voice in @entity40			2
but the ratcheting up of rhetoric has been occurring for so long that we almost do n't notice it anymore			0
this feeds the cycle of incitement that is polarizing our politics			0
it will only stop when members of the two parties start condemning extreme comments made by members of their own team			2
and if elected officials start to equate liberals with communists , it is time to break the glass in case of emergency , because we are losing any sense of perspective in @entity10 politics .			0

@entity30 congressman *falsely* *claimed* up to 81 *democrats* in @entity196 are communists
@entity198 says *leaders* of right and left have to condemn extreme views in their ranks
he says rep. @entity9 's attempt to raise funds *compounded* his nutty claim
