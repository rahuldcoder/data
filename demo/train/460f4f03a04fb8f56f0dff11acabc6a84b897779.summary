@entity0 , @entity1 -- more than 1,200 mourners , including hundreds who loved and admired @entity6 from a distance , packed a @entity0 church saturday to pay respects to the activist and estranged wife of a failed aspirant to the presidency			1
@entity6 died tuesday at the end of a six - year battle with cancer			1
" she has been a lighthouse to all of us			2
she 's always been that source of light to us			2
every lesson she has taught us has become part of our ethic , " said @entity6 ' oldest daughter , @entity21 , in a eulogy to her mother			1
among those lessons , @entity28 jokingly said , was " you 'll always regret prints , you 'll never regret solids			0
" @entity28 read from a letter her mother wrote her children in anticipation of death			0
she said her mother was always more concerned about others than she was herself , and had even tried to cheer up friends and family about her cancer fight and impending death			2
mourners included @entity44 sen. @entity43 , who in 2004 picked @entity6 ' husband , @entity45 , to be his vice presidential running mate in an unsuccessful bid for the @entity48			1
@entity45 and @entity6 separated earlier this year after the former @entity1 senator admitted to fathering a child out of wedlock while the couple was married			1
@entity53 entered the church saturday , holding hands with @entity21 , and the @entity6 ' two other children , @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity28 was preceded at the lectern by her mother 's longtime friend @entity60 , who made the audience laugh with tales of @entity6 's competitive nature , particularly with games			1
she also noted @entity6 ' love of @entity67 , describing how the @entity6 family , including @entity53 , decorated their christmas tree last saturday , just three days before she died			1
a friend of @entity6 ' family said saturday that @entity6 did not plan the funeral or instruct on many details			1
one family friend said the mood has been somber : " we all thought we 'd have more time to say goodbye			0
" in addition to the eulogies by @entity60 and @entity28 , another friend , @entity79 spoke , remembering when @entity6 told staffers about her cancer			1
according to @entity79 , she rubbed their backs as they sat on the couch , then turned to them and told them they had on awful shoes , and outlet shopping was necessary , right then and there			0
others in attendance included @entity1 gov. @entity95 ; @entity97 sen. @entity96 ( @entity98 ) ; @entity99 , the wife of the late sen. @entity100 ; @entity101 , a former @entity102 administration chief of staff and current head of the @entity104 ; members of @entity1 's congressional delegation ; and more than 100 former campaign staffers			0
it was a public ceremony because @entity6 was known for insisting , much to the dismay of staffers , that all of her events be open to the public , according to a friend			1
@entity6 did not plan the funeral or instruct many details , so the family decided a public funeral was what she would have wanted , even it added some chaos to the ceremony			1
the " public " mourners included several hundred people who packed a balcony inside the church , as well another 150 supporters who gathered a few blocks away from the church for a counter-demonstration against a group of picketers from the controversial @entity132			1
the @entity134 - based congregation is known for its extremist opposition against homosexuals , @entity137 and other groups and regularly holds protests at funerals for fallen @entity97 service members , saying the war 's dead are @entity145 's punishment for the country tolerating gays and lesbians			0
in the end , only five @entity132 congregants showed for the protest , which took place in a cold , steady rain			2
following the service at @entity155 , @entity6 was to be buried at @entity0 's @entity156 , according to the cemetery 's office manager @entity157			1
that ceremony was private , according to a memorial website for @entity6			1
earlier this week , @entity157 told @entity2 about the proximity of the burial to @entity6 ' son @entity163 , who was buried at the cemetery after dying in a 1996 car crash			1
" he is already interred there in a space			0
and she will be interred there beside him , " @entity157 said			0
four of @entity6 ' pallbearers were childhood friends of her son			1
they include @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 , who was an aide to @entity53 when he was in the @entity180			0
other pallbearers include longtime friend @entity182 , @entity183 , an @entity6 confidant and adviser , and her hospice doctor , @entity186			1
@entity187 , @entity28 ' fiance is also a pallbearer			0
@entity6 , who had four children and had worked as a bankruptcy lawyer in @entity0 , was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her husband lost his bid for vice president in november 2004			2
in 2006 , after her initial cancer diagnosis , she wrote " @entity196 : finding @entity197 from @entity198 , " which chronicled the aftermath of her son 's death and her battle with the disease			2
in 2008 , months after withdrawing from the presidential race , @entity53 admitted that tabloid claims about an extramarital affair with former campaign videographer @entity207 were true			0
eventually , he also admitted to fathering a child with @entity209 -- an allegation he initially vociferously denied even after conceding the affair			0
@entity53 said the affair happened in 2006 while his wife 's cancer was in remission			0
he claimed he informed his wife at the time and asked for her forgiveness			0
in an interview with the @entity220 after her husband admitted to his affair , @entity6 said the incident helped her focus on resuming her role as an advocate for the poor and for health care reform			2
she also said it pushed her to refocus on her role as a mother			0
in a september interview on " the @entity231 , " @entity6 was asked what she sees when she looks at her estranged husband , @entity53			2
" i see the father of my children , and that 's very important to me , " she said			0
" particularly since i have a terminal disease , this is the person who at some point will take over the primary parenting , and it 's important to me that he heal , if he needs to			0
" the memorial website for @entity6 states , " in lieu of flowers , donations may be made to the @entity252 , which benefits the @entity253 " according to the site , the learning lab is a computer and learning center in @entity0 that provides services free of charge			2
@entity2 's @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
