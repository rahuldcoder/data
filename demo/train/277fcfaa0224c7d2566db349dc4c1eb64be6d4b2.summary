@entity0 -- the nation 's major airlines -- lambasted for years because of canceled flights , long tarmac delays , late arrivals and lost luggage -- have significantly improved in all four of those key measurements of customer service , the federal government said thursday			1
indeed , airlines set an 18 - year record for on - time performance during the first half of this year , a report by the @entity12 said			1
and lengthy tarmac delays have decreased dramatically			0
the 586 lengthy tarmac delays recorded during the first half of 2009 dropped to four delays for the same time period this year			1
@entity21 : note on wing ' not the best approach ' the improvements are " very good news , " said @entity26 of @entity27 , a passenger advocacy group that fought for rules penalizing carriers for tarmac delays			0
" we said that our tarmac rules were going to force efficiency , and that 's what we think is happening , " @entity32 said			0
" i think the weather has something to do with it as well , in all fairness , " she said			0
airlines also have worked to improve customer satisfaction , @entity42 said			2
" i think they realized they hit a bottom and they realized their customers would n't take any more abuse			0
" in a statement , transportation secretary @entity51 also credited the new @entity12 rules			2
" our new airline consumer rules and our vigorous oversight of the aviation industry are holding airlines accountable to their customers , " @entity51 said			2
an airline trade group heralded the report			0
" our member airlines are delivering levels of customer service that no other industry , given its complexity , matches and are working to make air travel even more efficient for passengers and shippers , " @entity64 of @entity65 said in a statement			2
the improved service , interestingly , has not resulted in fewer complaints to the @entity12			1
instead , complaints rose 24 % during the first half of 2012 , the report says			1
a @entity12 spokesman said the department has seen an " uptick " in complaints when there 's a lot of publicity about airline consumer issues , such as january when many of the provisions of the new airline consumer rule took effect			1
industry officials say the complaints may be on the rise because the @entity12 has made it easier to file grievances , and because passengers may be complaining about factors not covered by the @entity12 report , such as rising ticket prices , cramped seating and baggage fees			1
plane lands at wrong airport in @entity103 the @entity12 may see another uptick when a new requirement takes effect requiring airlines to publish the @entity12 toll - free hotline number on web sites and e-tickets			1

-- airlines canceled 1.1 % of flights , also the lowest rate for the past 18 years			2
-- there were only four tarmac delays longer than three hours on domestic flights during the six - month period			0
this follows the department 's rule , which took effect in april 2010 , setting a three - hour limit for aircraft carrying passengers on domestic flights to sit on the tarmac			0
in contrast , there were 586 lengthy tarmac delays between january and june of 2009 , the year before the tarmac rule went into effect			0
-- airlines posted the lowest rate of mishandled baggage for the period since the data was first reported in september 1987			0
the record of 2.97 reports of mishandled baggage per 1,000 passengers improved on the previous january - june then - record low of 3.60 set last year			1
there were other measurements that , though small in number , put airline customer service in a negative light			0
