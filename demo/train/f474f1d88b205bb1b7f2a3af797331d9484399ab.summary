thanks to its large reserves of oil , the small @entity1 state of @entity2 has transformed over the decades from a humble pearl - farming backwater into one of the world 's richest countries per capita			1
but too much of a good thing , as many of @entity2 's 2.6 million inhabitants are discovering , can be problematic			1
in recent years , @entity2 waistlines have swollen to make them among the most obese people on the planet			1
nearly 70 % of @entity2 males over 15 are overweight or obese , according to the @entity18			2
for women , the figures are even worse -- slightly over 80 %			0
researchers from the @entity22 recently placed @entity2 second only to the @entity24 on a league table ranking countries by the amount of food they consumed per capita to sustain being overweight			1
the country 's weight gain has led to an unprecedented rise in obesity - related health problems , including heart disease and diabetes			2
it 's a phenomenon being reported in other @entity1 countries -- several of @entity2 's neighbors also appear in the top 10 , with @entity40 coming in 4th , the @entity41 6th , and @entity42 10th on the table			1
many attribute the weight problem to rapid changes in lifestyle propelled by oil revenues that have transformed @entity2 into prosperous modern consumer society			1
" i think it started with @entity2 being a rich country , " said fitness expert @entity50 , who was overweight himself until getting in shape eight years ago			1
" we have a lot of oil , so this transcends to how we live our lifestyles			2
it made our lives much easier			0
we do n't have to work in order to survive			0
" chief among these changes has been the introduction of fast food			1
@entity24 fast food outlets arrived with the @entity24 troops during the first @entity67 , becoming a permanent fixture on the country 's culinary landscape			1
some have tailored their menus to cater to bigger appetites in the region , such as a best - selling @entity76 dish that features a cheese pizza with a cheeseburger crust			2
@entity79 , a 36 - year - old @entity2 woman who is training for a 10 - kilometer race being organized alongside @entity2 's first marathon , said the love affair with fast food was leading many in her country to pile on the pounds			1
many lacked awareness of the health consequences of eating fast food regularly			1
" people in @entity2 consider @entity88 and @entity89 as full meal restaurants -- and not junk food , " she said			1
" the average @entity2 does not know what goes into that type of food			1
it 's just like a home - cooked meal			2
" the popularity of fast food over the past decade has been " unprecedented , " she said			1
and for the generation of children growing up eating it regularly , the consequences would be severe			0
" ( the mentality is ) it 's ok to bring the kids			0
it 's ok to have it two or three times a week , " she said			0
" some kids grow up not knowing that this is not good for them			0
" @entity88 , which opened its first outlet in @entity2 in 1994 , now has 65 restaurants across the country			2
spokesman @entity116 said @entity117 's was " just one choice in the eating - out market " and offered " a wide array of choices for consumers			2
" " we trust them to choose menu items that are right for their lifestyles , " he said			0
but there are other factors contributing to @entity2 's weight problem			1
the country 's harsh climate -- in which daytime temperatures can reach over 50 c , or 122 f -- makes it difficult to undertake physical activity during the day , encouraging a sedentary lifestyle and car culture			0
" it does n't encourage people to go out and walk or exercise , " said @entity140 , a 37 - year - old father who is also training for the race as part of a concerted effort to get in shape			1
he said @entity2 culture also placed strong emphasis on eating at communal gatherings -- with little value placed on moderation			2
" if you eat less , it means you did n't like it and whoever invited you is not a good host , " he said			0
but while some are embracing a new fitness culture of marathons and gym membership , others are turning to more drastic measures			0
stomach stapling procedures are becoming increasingly popular in @entity2 , with enough demand to prompt the country 's first conference for medical professionals involved in weight loss surgery last year			1
according to a report in @entity173 , the number of bariatric surgeons in @entity2 has increased tenfold over the past decade , with at least 5,000 patients receiving the procedure in @entity2 last year -- compared with 3,000 in @entity176 , which has more than 30 times the population			2
the report added that the legal barriers to surgery in @entity2 are lower than in the @entity24			1
but for @entity110 , the only lasting solution to obesity comes not from the shortcut of surgery , but hard work in the gym			0
" @entity187 , minute by minute , you have to work on it			0
you have to sacrifice things sometimes , " he said			0
" it does take a lot of work			0
" but " once they get there , " he said , " it becomes easier and easier			0
then what actually makes them happier is going out for a run			0
