-- the families of seven people killed and 61 survivors injured when a stage collapsed at the @entity5 in august are being offered a total of $ 5 million by @entity8 's attorney general			1
the settlements proposed by the state are separate from the lawsuit most of the families filed last month against @entity13 , the country duo that was set to perform just before a windstorm caused metal scaffolding to fall on dozens of fans			1
the estate of each of those who died would get at least $ 300,000 , while the injured would get 65 % of their medical expenses paid out of the state 's tort claims fund , attorney general @entity25 said in a news release tuesday			1
" no amount of money ever can replace lives lost or alleviate anguish endured by the victims of the @entity5 tragedy , " @entity25 said			0
" because state law limits the amount the state can pay to $ 5 million per incident or $ 700,000 per individual and we are legally obligated to defend those limits , we had to make extremely difficult decisions about which injured victims would receive payment out of the limited pool of funds available			1
" the estates and survivors must decide by december 12 if they will accept the state 's offer or pursue tort claims in court			0
metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto the " @entity54 , " a section usually occupied by @entity13 's most faithful fans , when a storm swept through the @entity5 on august 13			1
a lawsuit filed last month by 48 plaintiffs contends that the band " failed or refused to cancel the @entity13 concert despite inclement weather " and that it had " ultimate control over the lighting " that fell on many of the victims			1
" @entity13 had supervisory authority and discretion for stage size , lighting , instruments , trusses , sound equipment and location of sound equipment , and the stage system , " the suit said			2
forecasters warned that heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through , causing the collapse of the stage			2
the @entity84 estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph			0
" @entity13 was not required to perform if @entity13 determined their performance would be impaired or prevented due to inclement weather , " the suit said			0
" the decision whether to cancel the @entity13 concert due to weather conditions was the responsibility of @entity13			2
" @entity13 's representative said the group would offer no comment about the lawsuit			0
the suit also names other defendants , including @entity99 , the company that rented the stage , roof and lighting system , and event promoter @entity104 .			0

families of those killed would get $ 300,000 each , while injured would get 65 % of medical bills
