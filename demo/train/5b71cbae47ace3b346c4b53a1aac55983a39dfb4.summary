@entity0 -- a conservative magazine suggests @entity4 nominee @entity3 is " hostile " to gun owners , based on notes she wrote in the @entity6 in 1996			1
the notes were released last week by the @entity9			1
@entity3 worked in the @entity11 's office in 1995 and 1996			2
@entity3 , 50 , was nominated to the high court may 10 by president @entity13 , and her confirmation hearings begin june 28			1
the disclosure coincided with the release friday afternoon of about 80,000 more documents			0
a march 1996 document is likely to stir conservative anger			0
in it , she labeled the @entity22 and the @entity23 as " bad guy " organizations			2
the issue was a pending bill , the @entity28 , which gave some volunteer workers from a range of nonprofits a measure of liability protection from lawsuits			0
@entity3 expressed concern that certain groups might be included in a " @entity37 " of tax - exempt groups that would be covered under the proposed law			0
@entity3 addressed her handwritten thoughts , based on a conversation with @entity43 aide @entity42 , who responded that day that neither the @entity22 nor the @entity23 was on the list provided by the @entity45			2
@entity42 gently advised his colleague , " we probably need to be careful about suggesting ' bad ' organizations will qualify for the provision bill as it would suggest we are allowing ' bad ' organizations to qualify for tax - exempt status			0
" the measure was passed into law in 1997 , but ultimately vetoed by @entity55			0
@entity56 is now a federal judge			0
the @entity58 first reported about the notes , and asked on its website , " is @entity3 so hostile to gun rights that she would compare the top gun - rights organization in the @entity63 with a viciously racist hate group ? " the @entity65 issued a response friday			1
" @entity3 's notes from a conversation with @entity70 attorney @entity42 track an earlier memo @entity42 sent to her outlining which organizations would be shielded under volunteer and nonprofit liability legislation , " said @entity65 spokesman @entity67			1
" @entity56 's memo notes that neither the @entity22 nor the @entity23 would be shielded from liability under the bill , after democrats in @entity55 and others raised concerns that the provision swept too broadly			2
it 's simply not credible to suggest that these jotted down notes represent anything but preliminary research on legal questions about what organizations would be covered under the legislation , and the organizations discussed reflect the public debate over the legislation at that time			1
" the guns rights group also reacted to the @entity3 notes friday			2
" how can the @entity23 respond to something that bizarre and outrageous ? " @entity23 's director of public affairs @entity96 said in an interview with @entity1			1
" this is precisely the kind of stuff that needs to be aired out in the confirmation hearings , a complete airing out of where she stands on our issues			2
" some 160,000 pages of documents are being reviewed from @entity3 's four years in the @entity6 , during which , in addition to being in the counsel 's office , she also served as an adviser on the @entity115 from 1997 to 1999			1
papers from those stints have been released the past two fridays , revealing a lawyer with a politically tuned , pragmatic approach to issues like abortion , gun control and tobacco regulation			0
the material is a prelude to @entity3 's much - anticipated appearance before the @entity127			1
republicans on the panel continue to express deep concern that the weekly document releases provide little time for members to explore her work as a government lawyer , and whether they offer any clues about how she might rule as a justice on the nation 's highest court			0
" we must be convinced that someone who has spent the better part of her career as a political advisor , policy advocate , and academic -- rather than as a legal practitioner or a judge -- can put aside her personal and political beliefs , and impartially apply the law , rather than be a rubberstamp for the @entity13 or any other administration , " senate minority leader @entity142 , @entity143 , said in a floor speech friday			0
" the @entity43 library documents make it harder -- not easier -- to believe that ms. @entity3 could make that necessary transition			0
" the @entity65 has fashioned a low - key campaign to get @entity3 confirmed , trying to avoid any public controversy that could derail her elevation to a lifetime job on the bench			1
the @entity43 - era documents have been released on friday afternoons , and fridays generally are slow news days			0
@entity13 officials have refused to make @entity3 available for interviews since her nomination , and she has spent her days meeting privately with senators and prepping for the hearings in a small office in the @entity65 complex			1
if confirmed , @entity3 would succeed retiring justice @entity173			0
before stepping down from daily involvement , she was the administration 's solicitor general , and personally argued six cases before the @entity4			2
she has no judicial experience , and conservative critics have been eagerly scanning @entity3 's record in government service and academia for signs of her possible judicial philosophy .			1
