@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i arrived in @entity0 for @entity6 's 80th birthday festivities this week a customs official asked why i was visiting the country			1
when i explained she said " ah ! @entity6 -- he is everybody 's archbishop ! " she reflected the gratitude of a world that celebrates his leadership in calling out of the best of our humanity by claiming him as part of her life			1
at 80 @entity6 is as spunky as ever in imagining and working for a world where all are included			1
@entity6 's insistence on our need for one another in order to be fully human is the signature idea behind his global leadership on reconciliation , ending conflicts and hope			1
as the world celebrates his iconic leadership it illuminates the void in authentic ethical leadership in the global community			2
in my first personal meeting with @entity6 in 1980 i was thrown off guard by his question , " tell me about your life @entity44 - not what you 've done but who you are			1
" the question reflects his belief in the value and sacredness of each human story and that our lives are all bundled together			1
i was not prepared for his reaction to my story			0
i was 22 and @entity6 was 49 and i wondered what our lives could have in common			1
telling him of my lengthy hospitalizations as a teenager i said that i 'd had an unexpected visitor in @entity61 whose book " @entity65 " opened my eyes to the brutal realities of apartheid			0
@entity61 's expansive generosity about the humanity of all stood in sharp contrast to the way in which the community he served in @entity72 was bulldozed by the apartheid government because its multi-ethnic character did not fit the paradigm of apartheid to separate people at any cost			0
as i paused in the telling of my story @entity6 's laughter filled the room			1
incredulous , i just looked at him , waiting for him to settle down			0
finally @entity6 said , " when i was a young boy , i had tuberculosis			1
i spent months in the hospital , just like you , lonely and afraid			0
@entity61 was my priest ! he visited me almost every day , reading stories and talking to me			0
@entity61 inspired me to think about being a priest			0
" shared transformation , decades apart			0
on the common ground of our connecting story , @entity6 then asked , " tell me your thinking about serving in the military			1
" i shared with him my willingness to go to prison indefinitely as a consequence for refusing to serve in the @entity1 military that enforced apartheid			0
@entity6 thoughtfully said , " there will be a time when this kind of action will be important			2
" i had n't expected this reaction to a decision i had wrestled with for years			0
i had thirty days before showing up to report for military duty or else refuse to serve and be jailed			0
within ten days @entity6 had me out of the country and in @entity108			2
@entity6 had no reason to act as he did other than his profound sense of our shared humanity in working for a world in which justice and the wellbeing of all is an expression of his ethical leadership of compassion			1
fifteen years later i asked @entity6 when he would add @entity121 people into his compelling vision that we are all " made for oneness			2
" he assured me that it would be after the fall of apartheid			0
this iconic leader has been true to his word			0
to the ire of many and the delight of others , @entity6 is insistent that there are no outsiders with @entity136 or the human family			1
gender equity for women and the need to protect the environment stand alongside @entity6 's voice negotiating the ending of conflicts around the globe			2
his vision that we are all part of one family is a global vision			0
in a world of increasing xenophobia and a preponderance of leaders who serve the altar of exclusionary self - interest @entity6 stands out because of his view that we need one another in order to be fully human			1
that customs official was right -- @entity6 is " everybody 's archbishop " for a reason .			2

@entity162 : @entity6 still working for a world where all are included
@entity162 : @entity6 believes in the value and sacredness of each human story
@entity6 believes " we need one another in order to be fully human "
