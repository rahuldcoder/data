-- @entity2 president @entity1 hit back monday at human rights activists who say he 's behaving like an autocrat and fueling a bloody civil war in @entity2 's neighbor , @entity8			1
" if you are talking about people in the human rights community from outside ... i have an issue with this , " @entity1 said , 16 years after he was hailed as a hero for ending a genocide that killed at least 800,000 people			2
" you tend to make a judgment of a country , 11 million people , on what a couple of people have said and ( they ) do n't take into account what @entity2 say			2
" @entity1 added , " nobody has asked the @entity2 ... it 's as if they do n't matter in the eyes of the human rights people			1
it 's our own decisions in the end			0
" he said everyone in @entity2 has to play by the rules and be accountable			0
" there has to be leadership to make things move in the right direction , " @entity1 stated			0
@entity1 's comments came a month after the @entity43 - based group , @entity42 , said opposition activists are facing increasing threats , attacks , and harassment ahead of @entity2 's presidential election in august			1
@entity42 said opposition party members have suffered serious intimidation by individuals and institutions close to the government and @entity1 's ruling @entity55 ( @entity55 )			1
the @entity55 took power in 1994 after its army swept into the capital of @entity59 and overthrew the @entity61 - dominated government responsible for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of @entity2 , most of them members of the minority @entity65 community			2
in the aftermath of the 100 - day genocide , the fastest in modern history , @entity1 transformed his country , turning it into one of the fastest growing nations in @entity73 and -- in the view of some -- a model of economic and social development			1
@entity1 said @entity2 has made significant progress in erasing some of the scars left behind after the tragedy			1
" that 's why the country is stable			0
that 's why the country is moving on			0
that 's why the country is developing			0
" @entity1 insisted he has nothing to do with the continuing civil war in mineral - rich @entity8 , even though he acknowledged that @entity2 troops intervened there a decade ago in an attempt to stop rebel groups from returning to @entity2			1
the war became the largest and most destructive conflict in @entity73 history , costing more than 5 million lives , as various groups and foreign armies fought for control of @entity8 's land and mineral resources			2
" i can not be blamed for the problems of @entity8 or any other country , " @entity1 said			1
" there are the @entity8 who have their own country , who are supposed to manage it , who are supposed to govern it			0
it has nothing to do with me			0
