-- football 's version of the fabled @entity4 battle will begin on tuesday as @entity6 's top club competition kicks off its quarterfinal stage			1
in one corner , modern - day giants @entity10 -- one of the richest sporting teams in the world , with a squad featuring the planet 's most expensive player , @entity15			1
seeking to find a suitable slingshot are the players of @entity19 , a tiny @entity20 club playing in the last eight of the @entity22 for the first time -- indeed , being the first team from the @entity26 island to even reach the knockout stage			1
the gulf in pedigree between the two teams is immense			0
real , with revenue of more than â ‚ ¬ 400 million ( $ 530 million ) last year , will seek to notch a record 200th win in the competition in the first leg in @entity35			1
the @entity37 league leaders last won the competition in 2002 , but have an unmatched nine crowns since the first staging in 1955 - 56			2
@entity19 have a yearly budget of â ‚ ¬ 9 million ( $ 12 million ) and a squad featuring no big names , bolstered by several @entity44			2
both teams have a @entity47 player named @entity48 -- @entity10 's is an $ 85 million former world player of the year , while @entity19 's is a defender on loan from @entity53 club @entity52 who also played for the club 's @entity19 rivals @entity55 in 2010			1
they have another thing in common , this time an @entity59 link which further highlights the clubs ' different worlds			0
@entity62 was a midfielder who enjoyed a glittering career which saw him win the @entity22 with @entity10 in 2002 and @entity37 league titles in 2001 and 2003			1
but while @entity62 played alongside " galacticos " such as @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity47 @entity69 winner @entity15 , his younger brother @entity65 was beginning his career with @entity72 club @entity71			2
@entity62 turned out for historic teams such as @entity59 's @entity74 and @entity76 's @entity75 during 15 years as a player , but @entity65 has enjoyed a more modest career			0
the 31 - year - old has played for nine clubs across three continents , waiting patiently for the chance to step out of his sibling 's shadow			0
" i spoke to my brother and other members of my family after the draw , " @entity65 told @entity22 's official website			2
" we spoke a bit about the history of the club ( @entity10 ) and who they are			2
but that does n't change my feelings about this tie with respects to my brother having played for them			0
" i go into this game just like any other player in the team			0
we are confident and we believe in ourselves			0
" @entity19 , who have played just 49 @entity22 matches compared to @entity10 's record total of 343 , have already upset the odds to make it this far in the competition			1
@entity110 's team finished top of a group which contained @entity114 's @entity113 , @entity116 champions @entity115 and @entity119 title winners @entity117 -- three teams who have all tasted glory in the second - tier @entity123 in the last four years			0
@entity19 's unlikely run continued in the round of 16 with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over former @entity128 champions @entity127 -- who had reached the knockout stages in each of the previous eight seasons			1
@entity65 hopes his brother would not begrudge @entity19 a semifinal berth , where the minnows would face either 1993 winners @entity136 of @entity128 or @entity53 's four - time @entity138 champions and 2012 final hosts @entity139			1
" my brother is obviously a big supporter of @entity10 and he will be hoping that they can go on to lift the trophy , " the striker said			0
" but somehow , i believe there will be a piece of his heart rooting for my team as well			0
" @entity10 will be motivated by the prospect of an " @entity148 " final against archrivals and @entity22 holders @entity150 , after the two teams were kept apart in the quarterfinal and semifinal draw earlier this month			1
@entity150 , who beat real in the semifinals last year before going on to defeat @entity156 in the final , face a heavyweight clash against @entity76 's seven - time winners @entity159 on wednesday			0
tuesday 's other quarterfinal tie pits 2008 runners - up @entity162 -- who have enjoyed an upturn in domestic form since sacking manager @entity165 earlier this month -- against @entity167 's @entity166 , who lifted the @entity22 twice in the 1960s .			2

@entity37 giants @entity10 take on @entity20 minnows @entity19 on tuesday
@entity19 are the first @entity20 team to have reached the @entity22 knockout stages
real are aiming for a record 200th win in @entity6 's *premier* club competition
@entity10 have played 343 matches in the competition , @entity19 have played just 49
