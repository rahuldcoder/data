-- @entity2 nominee @entity1 has frequently railed against efforts championed by president @entity5 steering money to promote " green energy			1
" he continued that line of attack wednesday night , decrying what he described as " $ 90 billion in breaks to the green energy world			1
" " these businesses , many of them have gone out of business -- i think about half of them -- of the ones that have been invested in have gone out of business , " the former @entity17 governor said			2
so are @entity1 's assertions correct , both about the size of the " green energy " program and what happened to those companies that got money from it ? the facts : the @entity29 proudly touts that the 2009 stimulus authorized $ 90 billion " in government investments and tax incentives to lay the foundation for the clean energy economy of our future			1
" fact check : is @entity38 a small business ? but not all that money has been spent , and not all of it -- in fact , not even half of it -- is being directed to upstart green businesses			1
part of 2009 's much larger $ 787 billion stimulus package , this money went toward things like the weatherization of more than 770,000 homes and cleaning 688 square miles of land formerly used for @entity54 - era nuclear testing			1
many individual companies did benefit directly			0
the government website that tracks stimulus spending lists 27,226 individual awards under the " @entity60 " section , totaling just shy of $ 34 billion			2
the @entity29 this june specified " 33 clean energy projects " of a larger scale as part of its " loans program			0
" of those , financing had been " closed " on 20 of them			0
the intent was to promote new technologies and approaches , not necessarily old ones			0
there are also other things such as high speed rail and smart meters -- which are listed elsewhere , under " infrastructure , " as part of the same overarching stimulus legislation			0
accounting for things like that , a report from the @entity81 non-partisan think tank this april tabbed the total green stimulus spending at $ 51 billion			1
then , there 's the matter of whether half of those companies that have gotten money " have gone out of business			2
" a few recipients of the government funds have hit hard times			0
the most well - known of them is solar panel maker @entity96 , which received a $ 535 million loan guarantee from the @entity29			1
two years later , it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy			0
fact check : oil and natural gas production under @entity5 still , it is unclear where @entity1 got his figure that " half " those businesses are no longer operating			1
the @entity29 cites several success stories like one of the world 's largest wind farms in eastern @entity116 , massive solar power plants in @entity109 and grants to @entity111 to produce fuel - efficient cars			0
in fact , of the 28 funded projects -- involving 23 companies -- listed in a 2012 congressional report , only four involve businesses that were either sold or are not in operation			0
conclusion : it is fair to say that the 2009 stimulus authorized $ 90 billion for green energy , as @entity1 asserted			1
whether or not one terms these as " breaks " is subjective , and one should n't assume that all the funds went to specific businesses like @entity96			2
most of the large projects that benefited from the @entity29 loan program remain in operation -- contrary to @entity1 's assertion that " almost half " of them had closed			2
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity139 @entity0 's @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 decries " $ 90 billion in breaks to the green energy world "
he says " about half " of green firms aided by the 2009 stimulus are " out of business "
despite *flame* - outs like @entity96 , most businesses appear to be still operational
