-- @entity2 bids to become the first man to win the @entity5 sprint double twice while @entity8 champ @entity6 seeks to win a second major soccer title			1
here are five things to watch at the @entity5 on thursday : 1 ) men 's 200 meters : @entity12 vs. @entity12 before you go giving @entity2 the gold medal , @entity13 has something he wants to say			1
" i 'm not really focusing on beating him			0
i 'm concentrating on running my race			0
my plan is just to execute , " says the @entity12 champion			0
@entity21 of the @entity22 will try to spoil the race , but after @entity13 and @entity2 looked so impressive in their heats , it 's hard to see anyone challenging the training partners and friends			1
when athletes succeed , but judges fail @entity32 is at 8:55 p.m. @entity33 time ( 3:55 p.m. et ) 2 ) soccer : @entity22 looks for revenge in the @entity5 final , again the @entity8 " loss " in 2011 was one of the most heartbreaking results ever for the @entity22 women			1
the @entity22 led with nine minutes left in regulation and with three minutes left in extra time but lost the penalty - kick shootout to @entity6 3 - 1 ( the match result is deemed a draw )			1
the @entity22 , twice @entity8 champs and three times winners of the @entity5 , have several factors going for them in their revenge bid			1
no @entity8 champion has ever won the @entity5 the next year			0
and since 1995 , each time a team has knocked the @entity22 out of @entity8 , they 've met in the @entity5 a year later			1
the @entity22 has won every time , twice in the final			2
sex , games and @entity57 life gold medal match begins at 7:45 p.m. @entity33 time ( 2:45 p.m. et )			0
3 ) decathlon : @entity60 needs a good nap @entity60 appears ready to grab the title of world 's greatest athlete that comes with winning the @entity5 decathlon title			2
after the first day of the competition , the world record holder in the event had a nice 220 - point lead over his countryman @entity70			2
you 'd think @entity60 would be thrilled after breaking the @entity5 record for the decathlon 100 meters and topping the pack in three events			0
not so , after all , he 's only halfway home			0
and after a 12 - hour day , he was in a hurry to go get some sleep			2
" so far i am somewhat satisfied			0
i am in a good position			0
it has been a long day , " he said			0
@entity81 : i 'd do it for nothing the first of the five events on day 2 , the 110 - meter hurdles , is at 9 a.m. @entity33 time ( 4 a.m. et ) 4 ) women 's water polo : upstarts vs. @entity22 perhaps the fourth time will be the charm for the @entity22			1
since women 's water polo became an @entity5 sport in 2000 , the @entity22 have medaled three times , but none are gold			1
teenager @entity97 leads the @entity22 with 16 goals against @entity99 , which has never won a major tournament			1
@entity99 is led by @entity101 , who has 13 goals			2
the gold medal match is at 8 p.m. @entity33 time ( 3 p.m. et )			0
water polo placement matches begin at 2:30 p.m. @entity33 time ( 9:30 a.m. et ) 5 ) women 's 4x100 - meter relay : trying to get a handle passing the relay baton seems like it should be an easy thing to do			1
but in the past two @entity5 ( and several world championships ) the @entity22 women have botched a pass and not finished a race			1
the @entity22 begin their @entity33 quest with a qualifying heat thursday night			2
@entity116 , who passed on a runoff for a place in the 100 meters after tying @entity119 at the @entity22 trials , is part of the six - member pool			1
she might run in the early rounds			0
but @entity116 ran with an " a " relay squad in a tuneup meet and the result was familiar : a missed handoff			0
@entity130 floors @entity12 rivals round 1 of the relays begins at 8:20 p.m. @entity33 time ( 3:20 p.m. et )			0

@entity2 goes for *unprecedented* double double
@entity22 1 - 2 after first day of decathlon
