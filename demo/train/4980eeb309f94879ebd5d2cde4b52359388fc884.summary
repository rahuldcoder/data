@entity0 , @entity1 -- sex columnist @entity3 and author of the popular syndicated sex advice column " @entity6 , " made his way to @entity0 , @entity1 , to attend the @entity8 where he is filming a piece for @entity12 's " @entity10 with @entity11			1
" sex columnist @entity3 is reporting on the @entity14 convention for @entity12 's " @entity10 with @entity11			1
" planted in the @entity15 , @entity3 shares his thoughts on @entity18 's running mate , @entity17 , tells us what a sex columnist is doing at a political convention , and gives us his take on who 's sexier , @entity24 or @entity14			1
here are five questions for @entity3 : @entity2 : you 're here because you 're a lifelong @entity8 ? @entity3 : no , that 's not true , actually			1
i 'm a @entity30 , although i am a registered @entity14 in @entity31 , but just to drive the @entity32 up the wall			0
@entity2 : why are you here ? @entity3 : i was here to see if i could find any evidence of @entity37 at the convention			1
and i found very little			0
there was that satellite feed			0
i bought this button [ points to @entity43 button on his shirt ]			2
this will be the only time you 'll see @entity43 at the convention is when you see me walk by with this button ... i was n't able to purchase it here ... i mean you talk to @entity8 delegates walking around , a lot of them will admit that @entity37 has been a major disappointment and they 're happy that he 's not here			1
and one of the reasons that they 're happy he 's not here is that they do n't want @entity59 reminded that four years ago and eight years ago , these same delegates ... thought @entity37 walked on water			2
@entity2 : why would " @entity10 with @entity11 " send a sex columnist to cover the @entity8 ? @entity3 : because when you 're a sex writer in @entity59 you have to write about politics because politicians will not stop obsessing about it -- screwing around with people 's sex lives			2
often when i write about politics in " @entity6 , " my sex advice column , people write to me and say , " you 're a sex columnist , stick to sex			0
" and i 'll say -- i usually respond -- " i 'll be able to stick to sex when politicians stick to politics and leave our sex lives alone , and stop politicizing our sex lives			0
and it 's one of the major differences between the two political parties , our sexual issues			0
and so my view is very relevant , i feel very at home here			0
@entity2 : any thoughts on @entity18 's running mate choice ? @entity3 : i think @entity17 has been the clown car of the vice presidential nominee			1
you never know what 's going to pop out of @entity17 next			1
@entity2 : who 's sexier : republicans or @entity24 ? @entity3 : well , there 's just something about those @entity101			2
they 're very tense and nervous			0
i spoke to a lot of them because i 've been running around the convention asking teenagers throughout the convention if they 're virgins or not			0
' cuz i feel like i have a right to know because we 've invested over a billion dollars in abstinence education programs under @entity37 .			2

@entity3 : here to see if i could find any evidence of @entity37 at the convention
@entity3 : i found very little of @entity37 or @entity43
@entity3 : " i think @entity17 has been the clown car of the vice presidential nominee "
@entity3 : " you never know what 's going to pop out of @entity17 next "
