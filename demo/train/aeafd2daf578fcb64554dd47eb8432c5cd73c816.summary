-- the dispersant used on the massive @entity2 oil spill appears to be breaking up within weeks and is less toxic than similar products , according to preliminary testing by the @entity6			1
@entity7 , the agency 's assistant administrator for research and development , told reporters wednesday the agency is making no new recommendations until further tests are conducted			1
but he said there is no sign that dispersants are remaining in the water or settling to the bottom , and that the @entity20 being used by oil company @entity21 is among the least toxic to small fish and mysid shrimp of the eight products tested , @entity7 said			2
mysid shrimp are a tiny type of shrimp commonly used in tests of toxins in seawater			0
@entity7 said all the dispersants tested are " not without toxicity , " and the studies have not examined the effects of the biodegraded products or of the combination of dispersants and the crude oil that has been gushing into the @entity2 since late april			0
but a @entity39 - based environmental group is expressing qualms about the dispersant and the massive amounts being dumped in the @entity2			1
" this has never been done , this kind of volume , this kind of application , " said @entity43 of the @entity44			0
" it 's all really a giant science experiment , and we 're terribly concerned that in the long run the impacts are going to be significant , and we really donÂ¹t know what we 're doing to the ecosystem			0
" the group is calling for an immediate end to @entity21 's use of dispersants in the @entity2			1
" we 're two months into this disaster , two months plus			0
so it seems like we 'd start to have some answers by now as to what the better alternatives are , " @entity43 said			0
" we 're very concerned that @entity21 is using a product that they know that they have on hand , and that they 're not really being challenged to use better products			0
" the government 's @entity70 website reported earlier this week that more than 1.5 million gallons of dispersants have been used in the battle against the oil spill			1
that includes more than a million gallons in surface dispersant and more than 500,000 gallons in subsea dispersant			1
the @entity6 acknowledges that 's much more than has been used before in responding to an oil spill			2
the @entity6 ordered @entity21 to sharply cut back its use of @entity20 in may amid concerns about its safety			2
it initially tried to force @entity21 to use another dispersant on the spill , but the company said no safer products were available in large enough quantities .			2

new : 1.5 million gallons of dispersants used in battling spill
@entity93 environmental group calls for end to dispersant use , despite @entity6 findings
@entity6 says dispersant currently being used is less toxic than others
@entity6 making no recommendations until more tests conducted
