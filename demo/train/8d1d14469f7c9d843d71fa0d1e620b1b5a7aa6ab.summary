@entity2 's freshly inaugurated @entity1 president plunged tuesday into the economic mess that has perplexed policymakers and threatened governments by calling for policies that would spur growth in the ailing eurozone			1
" i said that my wish is that growth is not an empty phrase , that it is something which , in reality , is happening , " @entity9 told reporters in a joint news conference with @entity13 chancellor @entity12 in @entity14			1
" because , without growth , we ca n't do whatever we want , we wo n't reach the goals which we want to -- and to reduce the debt and deficit			2
" he said the best solution would be to " put everything on the table " on may 23 , when the region 's leaders plan to meet next			0
@entity9 said he hopes @entity26 -- whose economy is teetering and whose populace is fed up with the austerity demands imposed by the country 's international lenders -- will remain in the eurozone , adding , " that 's why we have to make it possible for @entity26 to find solutions			1
" but he said it is up to the @entity26 themselves to make their own decisions about what is best for the country			1
" whatever happens , i will respect the decision of @entity26 , " he said			1
for her part , @entity12 acknowledged after their hour - long meeting that " there is going to be , maybe , differences , but also lots of togetherness			0
" she noted that @entity9 's plane was struck by lightning as it flew from @entity51			1
" maybe that 's a good omen , a sign for our cooperation , " said @entity12 , who has championed austerity measures			0
@entity2 's first @entity1 president since @entity58 left office in 1995 won in an election this month against incumbent @entity61			1
opinion : what @entity9 's victory means for @entity66 's economy @entity9 named @entity68 , a senior party member and mayor of @entity70 , as prime minister and asked him to form the new government , his office said			1
at an investiture ceremony at the @entity74 in @entity51 , @entity9 said he wants to balance the need to reduce the debts of @entity66 governments with efforts to stimulate growth			1
he said he wants to discourage " exorbitant " incomes			0
" it 's time to put production ahead of speculation , " he said			0
" the challenge of this five - year term is recovery , " he said at the @entity84 in @entity51 , prior to departing for @entity14			0
" we have big plans			0
@entity2 will rise again and build on the strength and the energy of its creators , of its engineers , its researchers , those who make it live			1
" @entity9 has unsettled investors with his criticism of the austerity policies central to @entity66 bailout deals for troubled economies like those of @entity26 and @entity101			1
greeted by flag - waving crowds on the street , a steady stream of prominent @entity2 figures arrived at the elysee ahead of tuesday 's inauguration ceremony and walked on a red carpet through the palace 's sun - filled courtyard			1
they included the @entity114 leader @entity113 and @entity115 , the mayor of @entity51			0
inside the palace , they gathered under chandeliers to witness the transfer of power			0
the president - elect 's car traveled along the tree - lined streets and avenues of @entity51 , carrying him over the @entity126 and past the @entity127 before pulling up inside the courtyard			0
@entity9 made his way up the carpet to be met by @entity61			1
the two men , who had fought an at - times bitter campaign , shook hands before entering the palace for a private meeting			0
afterward , @entity61 and his wife , @entity136 , left the palace , waving from a car as they were driven off , and @entity9 was sworn in as the seventh president of @entity2 's @entity141			1
@entity68 , his newly appointed prime minister , has served as president of the @entity143 in the @entity144 since 1997			1
in the same year , @entity68 was given a six - month suspended sentence and fined 30,000 francs for political favoritism			2
born in 1950 to working - class parents , he worked as a @entity13 teacher before entering politics			0
he has served as mayor of @entity70 since 1989 and had been widely expected to be @entity9 's pick for prime minister			1
@entity9 's election coincided with the vote in @entity26 that spawned the current political chaos in @entity156 and moved @entity26 closer to the possibility of abandoning the euro , the currency used by it and 16 other @entity160 countries			1
@entity9 's professed doubts about the fiscal austerity advocated by @entity12 , whose party suffered defeat in a vote sunday in @entity13 's largest state , have raised questions about whether @entity51 and @entity14 will read from the same script			2
@entity9 has wasted no time addressing the matter			2
upcoming events include a @entity173 meeting and @entity175 summit this month , followed by a @entity177 gathering and a @entity179 meeting in june			0
his approach is expected to affect policy in @entity182 as well as @entity183 and the @entity184			0
with @entity61 , the @entity185 enjoyed support for its positions on @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity182			0
@entity61 also was a proponent of the @entity175 air campaign in @entity191			0
@entity9 , meanwhile , has yet to stake out all of his foreign policy positions			2
during the election campaign , he pledged to withdraw all @entity2 combat troops from @entity182 by the end of the year			2
he can expect @entity175 leaders to urge him to soften his position when he attends the summit in @entity202 this month , the focus of which will be @entity182			0
relations between @entity183 and @entity2 have been tense because of @entity61 's apparent opposition to @entity183 becoming a member of the @entity160			2
legislation passed during his presidency that made the denial of the @entity210 genocide a crime also raised hackles in @entity213			0
some observers expect @entity9 to show more flexibility on @entity183			2
domestically , @entity9 has to prove to the @entity2 public that he is capable of acting on his promise to bring people together after @entity61 's presidency , which often polarized opinion			1
voting in the first round of the presidential election showed large numbers of voters turning to parties on the far left and right of the political spectrum			0
that scenario could be repeated in legislative elections to be held next month , where @entity9 's @entity114 can secure a majority in parliament that would allow him to push through his agenda .			2
