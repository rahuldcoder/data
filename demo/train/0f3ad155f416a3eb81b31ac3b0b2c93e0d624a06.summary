@entity0 , @entity1 -- unraveling the complex back stories of the more than 200 pardons issued by former @entity1 gov. @entity5 is revealing serious questions about how pardon review decisions were carried out			1
but perhaps no pardon is as confounding as the case of @entity10			1
the retired @entity13 investigator 's pardon has been called " heinous " by critics of @entity5			1
" someone did n't do their homework on this case , " said @entity16 state rep. @entity15			2
when @entity5 pardoned @entity10 in january , the convicted @entity22 felon was sitting in an @entity0 , @entity1 , jail cell for violating the terms of a previous @entity22 sentence and was awaiting formal charges from yet another drunken driving accident in october that ended in the tragic death of 18 - year - old @entity29			1
who 's at fault in that accident has yet to be determined			2
the teenage girl from @entity34 , @entity1 , had big dreams of saving money and going to college to pursue a business degree			1
the young woman 's death and the controversy surrounding the case have devastated @entity43 , @entity44 's mother			2
" she should still be here with me			0
she should still be here with me			0
this should not have happened , " @entity43 told @entity2 during an emotional two - hour interview			0
@entity10 was given a full pardon for a felony drunken driving offense dating from march 2009			2
that offense was @entity10 's third drunken driving arrest in a little more than year			1
the @entity54 and @entity5 have issued statements saying they did n't know @entity10 had another @entity22 arrest in october			1
it came after his pardon case had already been reviewed			0
@entity0 @entity61 sgt. @entity60 arrested @entity10 twice over a span of a year for @entity22			1
" right before i put the cuffs on him he said , ' do n't do this to me			2
' and my comment to that usually is , you did it to yourself , " @entity60 told @entity2 as he recounted details of the two arrests			0
for the third dui , @entity10 had been sentenced in march 2010 to a year of house arrest and four years in @entity1 's drug court program , an intense drug - and - alcohol - abuse treatment program with strict guidelines that convicted felons like @entity10 must follow			1
@entity10 was still going through the drug court program when he started applying for a pardon last summer			2
high - profile friends wrote letters to @entity5 touting what they called @entity10 's genuine lifestyle change			1
the letters detail what friends described as @entity10 's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a " freakish house fire " and after @entity10 's divorce , according to pardon and parole documents obtained by @entity2			1
one letter said @entity10 " no longer drinks alcohol " and " has turned his life around			2
" " @entity10 has led a tragic life			2
a life that has now been turned around by a grace that is bigger than him			0
he can now be a positive factor in many lives , " wrote retired @entity98 attorney @entity97			0
on september 30 , the @entity54 sent its review of the @entity10 case to @entity5			1
the board recommended @entity10 for a full pardon with a divided 3 - 2 vote			2
about a week later , on october 7 , @entity10 was driving under the influence again , according to the @entity107			2
@entity29 attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside @entity109 when @entity10 's truck slammed into the side of her car			1
@entity29 was killed and her older sister suffered serious injuries			0
@entity10 still has not been indicted by a grand jury in that crash			2
because his third dui was pardoned , a conviction in the latest dui case would technically be his third offense , but that would still make it a felony in @entity1			1
the @entity54 and @entity5 are at a loss to explain how @entity10 's pardon could have unfolded the way it did			1
state officials say there is not a mechanism in place to alert them of situations like this			0
a @entity133 spokeswoman referred all questions about the case to the @entity54			0
@entity137 ' pardon application packet sent from the @entity54 to the governor 's office is filled with references to the " expedited investigation into the circumstances surrounding @entity10 's crime , " meaning his third dui from 2009			1
according to a state prison official , the " expedited " rush was a result of a flood of pardon applications as the clock was counting down toward the end of @entity5 's final term as governor			1
@entity5 refused @entity2 's request for an interview but his spokeswoman , @entity158 , issued a statement			1
" in reviewing mr. @entity10 's case , gov. @entity5 took the @entity54 's recommendation into consideration , and he was n't aware of the subsequent charges , " she said			1
@entity166 , chairwoman of the @entity167 , issued a statement saying : " i can say that mr. @entity10 's application was supported by testimonials from trustworthy and outstanding members of the community			1
while the reported circumstances of that arrest are troubling , our system of justice does regard everyone as innocent until proved guilty			0
" @entity43 , @entity44 's mother , worries her teenage daughter 's death has been forgotten in all of this			0
she struggles to understand how state officials could not have known that the man involved in her daughter 's violent crash was the same @entity10 who had petitioned for a pardon			1
" she was a person			0
she was n't just some name on a piece of paper			0
a beautiful person , " said @entity43			0
her days now are often spent weeping over her daughter 's death			0
she cried throughout most of her interview with @entity2 as she showed photographs of the beautiful girl with big dreams			0
@entity43 described her daughter as an artist with a big heart , and she proudly talked about the powerful emotions she feels holding a collection of her daughter 's paintings			0
one of the paintings was a gift from @entity206 to her mother			0
instead of signing the painting , @entity44 left her handprint on the back			0
but perhaps the most poignant painting was of swirling blues and purples and oranges that reads " @entity215			0
" the girl with the artist 's heart is now mourned by her mother with a broken heart .			0

@entity10 is a repeat @entity22 offender
he was pardoned for his third dui while facing charges for a fourth
@entity10 received one of more than 200 pardons issued by @entity1 's former governor
former gov. @entity5 says he was n't aware of @entity10 's fourth @entity22 violation
