-- @entity1 premiered his much - discussed short film / art installation " @entity2 " at the @entity3 last night			1
starring @entity5 as a car thief who falls in love with a blind @entity9 princess , the clip is the project he was reportedly working on in the @entity11 in february			1
the film 's cast also includes @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity18 actor @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity1 himself			1
as @entity20 points out , " @entity2 " is similar to @entity1 's 2010 short film " @entity22 " in that it 's an extended music video with little dialogue and plenty of striking imagery			1
" @entity2 " utilizes seven screens and features completely new music from @entity29 and his @entity31 affiliates that will reportedly appear on an album , also titled @entity2 , set for release sometime this year			1
reactions to the music have been overwhelmingly positive , with @entity20 calling it " rocking " and @entity38 senior editor @entity37 tweeting from the premiere that the music " was the best part -- big complex production , huge beats			0
" the @entity44 noted multiple instances of chair - dancing in the audience			0
response to the film has also been generally warm			0
the @entity51 film blog 24 frames wrote , " the story is secondary to the pyrotechnics , with new music from @entity29 and a thumping surround - sound quality that makes a @entity57 @entity59 effort feel like an @entity60 short			1
" vulture , meanwhile , praised @entity1 's " great visual sense " and noted the effectiveness of the special camera rig invented for the film to incorporate all seven screens , whether it was stretching a single shot across multiple screens or having each display a different image / angle during a single scene			1
" the movie is all @entity1 's vision -- his images , his music and costumes he designed , mixed with pieces by local @entity9 designers , " wrote @entity71			1
" he put it together in two - and - a - half months with only four days of actual shooting			0
" in a speech following the film , @entity1 said , " i was very particular about having the screens be separate and having it where your mind puts the screens back together -- the way you can put memories together , the way that happens throughout the day and it all links back up			2
" vulture also managed to score a comment from one of the many stars in attendance , @entity106 " it 's about the things that separate us -- race and class in society and things like that			2
but the only thing that really binds us is true love , " he said			0
@entity1 said he will keep working on and improving the film , and he plans to bring it to @entity112 and @entity113 in the future			2
" i 'm not the best director in the world or anything like that , but i had an idea , " said @entity1 during his post-film speech			2
" i could dream of , one day , this being the way that people watch movies , in this form where it surrounds you and people want to go back and see it more and more because they missed something else to the left and missed something else to the right , and it felt more like the experience of life			0
