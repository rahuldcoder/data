-- as fellow family members challenge claims that the first person diagnosed with @entity5 in the @entity6 lied about his exposure to the virus , the man 's mother rallied around him friday in describing him as a good person who she just wants to hug again			1
" everyone ( in the family ) loves him because ( if ) anything happens to us , he 's always there for us , " @entity10 , @entity11 's mother , told @entity0			1
@entity11 arrived in @entity17 from @entity18 on saturday , september 20			2
he started feeling sick a few days later , before being admitted to @entity19 -- where he 'd gone and been sent home previously -- on sunday , september 28			0
two days later , a blood test confirmed he had @entity5			2
@entity11 is currently in isolation in serious condition at the same @entity26 hospital			2
how the @entity18 national left @entity28 , and whether he should have been allowed to , has become a hot topic in recent days			0
hazmat crews clean up , quarantined quartet moved out before flying out , @entity11 allegedly answered " no " to questions on a health screening questionnaire about whether he 'd cared for anyone with @entity5 , touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease			1
but @entity39 , a community leader in @entity18 , has said that @entity11 was " a caretaker " for a woman who died from @entity5 at a residence outside the capital of @entity43			1
because of these and other claims , @entity45 officials say they may prosecute @entity11 if he lied before leaving that @entity48 nation			2
the @entity50 's office said friday that it is " looking into whether or not @entity11 knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter			1
" discussing this case , @entity18 president @entity55 told @entity59 public broadcaster @entity57 , " the fact that he knew ( he was exposed to the virus ) and he left the country is unpardonable , quite frankly			1
" " with the @entity6 doing so much to help us fight @entity5 , and again one of our compatriots did n't take due care , and so , he 's gone there and ... put some @entity6 in a state of fear , and put them at some risk , and so i feel very saddened by that and very angry with him , to tell you the truth			1
" @entity11 's nephew on friday strongly rejected such allegations , much like other relatives have in recent days			1
sitting alongside @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity76 told @entity0 's @entity80 that @entity11 told him " he had moved a long time ago " from an area hit hard by @entity5			1
" he said , ' well , i was n't even in that area , ' " said @entity76 in direct response to @entity39 's claim			0
" ... he was n't a part of that whole scenario that has been populating the news all these many days			0
" weeks proceeded to take a shot at some @entity18 citizens and " so many ignorant government officials , " saying it 's not fair that such claims can be made public without being vetted first			1
" any time they see a camera , they just jump right in front of it and make a statement , " @entity76 said			0
" unfortunately , most of them are ignorant , and they are all lies			0
" as to what 's happened in the @entity6 , @entity89 criticized @entity19 for not connecting the dots and passing on relevant information that @entity11 had come from @entity18			1
this should have tipped off the possibility he had @entity5 , given his symptoms ; instead he was let go from the hospital after about four hours , according to his partner , who identified herself to @entity0 only as @entity111			2
@entity6 health officials have said that the failure to pass on this information was a mistake			1
" it was upsetting to find that he was possibly infected with that deadly disease , and the hospital was not showing me any signs that they were equipped to handle that particular situation , " said @entity76 , who added that he called the @entity115 for the @entity116 but did not specify when			0
who 's in charge of stopping @entity5 in the @entity6 ? @entity123 -- @entity111 's daughter who called @entity11 her " stepdaddy , " though her mother and he are n't believed to be legally married -- was the one who called sunday for the ambulance for @entity11 while visiting the apartment where he was staying			1
but she told @entity0 on friday night that she learned that @entity11 had @entity5 " on the news			2
" @entity129 said she 's especially frustrated that , while she may not be technically quarantined , health officials told her tuesday , " we ca n't go outside , we ca n't do nothing			1
" " we asked them , ' can we go outside to get our babies ' diapers ' ? " she said			0
" they told us , ' no. you guys should stay in here until we can ask our boss if you guys can go out			0
" three days later , @entity123 -- who claims @entity11 never threw up or even went to the bathroom when she saw him -- has n't heard back			0
" no one gave me any direction , " she said			0
" ... i 'm scared			0
" all these frustrations notwithstanding , @entity11 's mother also made a point friday to emphatically thank the doctors , nurses and attendants now caring for her son			2
while some might have made mistakes , others are working hard to try to get him better			0
" i thank every one of you , ( @entity158 ) thank you for my son , " she said			0
all ( his ) family members love him			0
