-- hosts @entity1 were denied victory by an incredible @entity4 comeback to force a 4 - 4 draw in the opening match of the troubled @entity7 in @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity1 appeared headed for an emphatic victory when they led 4 - 0 with only 16 minutes remaining before @entity4 produced one of the most remarkable recoveries in the history of the competitive football			1
@entity18 's @entity17 with a double , a brilliant @entity20 header and finally , deep into injury time , the equalizer from substitute @entity16 completed the great escape			1
the dramatic match went ahead against the tragic backdrop of the murderous machine gun attack on the @entity27 team bus in @entity28 on friday , which left two dead and several injured			0
@entity1 president @entity29 issued a rallying call in his speech to mark the official opening of the competition , which was attended by several heads of state , including @entity36 's @entity35 whose country hosts the @entity39 finals later this year			0
" despite the terrorist attack , @entity28 will remain a hosting city , " he said			0
" there is no need to be afraid			0

@entity51 put them two ahead by the break with headed goals in the 36th and 42nd minutes			1
@entity4 pressed hard at the start of the second half with their captain @entity57 denied by a point - blank save , but their efforts were undermined when they conceded a 65th minute penalty which @entity63 converted at the second attempt			2
@entity63 was then brought down by @entity17 to concede another soft penalty and @entity66 slotted home the fourth to send the home fans in the 11th of november stadium wild with delight			1
their appeared little danger when @entity17 scrambled the ball home in the 79th minute from a corner and alarm bells were still to ring when @entity77 striker @entity20 at last showed his quality with an 88th - minute second goal			2
