@entity0 , @entity1 -- one year , 365 days and an endless number of seconds , transformed my life 360 degrees , made it go from color to black - and - white , turned laughter into tears			1
i now no longer perceive the world as a 14 - year - old innocent girl who takes everything for granted , more as a victim of a terrible experience that 'll never fade away , always reminding me of what others go through and a memory that will forever stay with me			1
before the revolution , i remember how , on cold winter nights we would sit together as a family , around the crackling fire sipping hot chocolate			1
i remember the smoke from the fireplace , wafting upward , leaving a scent of burning wood in the air			1
i remember looking into my sister 's eyes and that glimmer they always had , the smiles my parents would share			1
i remember how i used to love breaking the silence of the moment by rushing into my father 's lap , tracing the narrow path of velvet veins on his hand , as i enthusiastically told him about my day at school , my second home and my friends , my second family			1
we do n't live those days anymore			1
now no one 's eyes can lie , and the only sound i can hear is the screaming of sorrow			1
march 23 , 2011 was the first day i saw a demonstration in @entity54			1
i was driving to a friend 's birthday party , through streets that were packed with people carrying flags and calling out chants in support of the regime			1
i was oblivious to my surroundings , i did n't know what was going on			1
i thought it was just a demonstration that would blow over			1
" barely any one is coming ! their parents are too scared to send them because of what 's happening , " my friend cried when she saw me			1
i looked into her eyes and saw the tears slowly forming and streaming down her red cheeks , streaking her dark make - up			1
as weeks passed by it kept getting worse			1
one day i jumped out of bed to the sound of something loud shattering the windows of my room			1
@entity81 , i got up too quickly , barely noticing the glass sparkling on my dull rug			2
i ran but came to a sudden halt as i felt my head spinning and my vision darkening			2
my mom was crying and hugging my sister tightly			2
" a bomb hit an area nearby , " my mother stuttered , switching through the different news channels while trying to block us from seeing it			2
i managed to get a glimpse of it , on the tv , something i wish i had never seen			2
i remember my eyes feeling assaulted by the brightness on the screen , a sight that haunts me every night ; dead bodies , bits of human flesh , were spread out like dispersed glass			2
i closed my eyes and opened them again , hoping i would go back to the life i was used to , where unicorns and rainbows existed along with prince @entity111 and forever afters			1
unfortunately now , the dark days , and the nightmares take place on a regular basis , devastating my country and reluctant as i am to let it in , taking over my life , and controlling my mind			1
from then on the world changed for me			2
instead of learning it slowly through experience it was taught to me harshly through the sound of gunshots and bombardments			2
i discovered how cruel life can be , and how in one second a smile can turn into a tear , peace into war , a friend into an enemy and life into death			1
i lived in a blur , not knowing what had happened or what i was to do			2
i woke up every morning to the sound of gunshots , bombs or the roaring helicopters accompanied by the sad news of the death or kidnapping of someone we knew			1
some evenings , i hid under my blankets , covered my ears , and thought of the past trying to feel safe again			2
i silently peeked out my window to continuously stare at the moon in its different forms casting a dim light , to stare at the sky and the stars emerge taking their place in the night			2
the image drawing me further and further from reality , into the life i yearned to go back to			1
my parents tried to stay strong teaching us to do the same , until one night it all fell apart			2
i was sitting in my room , the place i had n't left for a long time , talking to my friend about our memories , and suddenly , i hear a cry , whispers , the sound of my mother 's sobs , then her yelling			2
" i 'm going out to find him ! " my family has its own business and my father was late coming back home , not answering his phone			1
" but it 's too dangerous ! " my aunt screamed back at my mother			2
" i do n't care ! " my mother shouted back			2
i ran down the spiraling staircase terrified , afraid of what was happening			2
everything went black , like a starless night			2
i felt like the walls of the house were closing in , suffocating me			0
the background noise was blocked out and all i could do was stand and stare in dismay at my mom in this state for the first time			0
she lay on the stone courtyard just outside our front door , crying , holding her phone with a shivering hand dialing my dad 's number like her life depended on it			1
it was like someone pressed the pause button in a movie , and now the seconds felt like hours			0
all i could hear was the pounding of my heart screaming over my mom 's voice			0
i do n't know how long we waited , or how fast my heart was beating , but when my dad 's car turned the corner , i gave everything i had left to run and hug him tighter than ever			0
at that moment my senses returned and i realized how cold the ground was under my bare feet			0
i carried my mom inside , and from that day on i learned that though she may be older , taller and more experienced , deep down she needs me just as much as i need her			0
now , the one thing i looked forward to was waking up every morning and creeping into my parents ' bedroom to look at my dad 's thin and frail face making sure he had made it in safe the night before			1
in school , only half my class was left			0
" at least we have each other , " said one of my five best friends with a comforting smile			1
however that did n't last for long			0
devastating news kept coming at us , beginning with the death of my friend 's uncle			0
" in one second i lost my uncle ; a part of me , " she whispered in a heartbreaking tone			0
i looked at her hopelessly , trying to comfort her , but i knew no words could bring him back			0
every morning for one month , no words were spoken by anyone besides the ones of regret			1
" if we knew this was coming , we would have done things so differently , " we would tell each other			0
we would n't have taken so much for granted , we would have appreciated what we had			0
instead it was ripped away			0
grades dropped , smiles faded , students left , and all that remained were the memories that we would safely lock away			0
as my dad protectively drove us to and from school , the only places we could go to , i noticed the row of soldiers on the streets			0
they reminded me of domino pieces			0
each one had a solemn appearance , frightening eyes that looked right through you below their crunched frown			0
however , what always caught my eye were their large guns , the color of the dark pine trees they leaned on			1
i went from looking at colorful flowers and singing birds every morning , to dark killer weapons			1
april 5 , 2012 was my last day of school			0
my parents decided to move us all to @entity1			0
i had known it was coming all along			0
it was n't a surprise			0
i sank in my seat that day at school , buried my head into my hands and cried like i did every day			0
i remembered how when i heard the news about @entity304 and the violence in @entity306 and thinking to myself that i was far from harm 's way			0
now i was considering how hard it would be to move away from my home , my dad , my friends and family -- not knowing anyone or anything , possibly never being able to contact them because of the broken phone lines			1
my mind wandered back to 10 years ago when i first stepped foot into the school , only worrying about things like my friendship bracelets , and now i was expected to leave everything i ever knew behind			0
the people who knew me inside and out , who had carved a place in my heart			0
memories flashed accompanied by more tears as my friends gathered around me and i opened my swollen eyes trying to picture the scene hoping it would last forever			0
i am angry and i feel hatred to the people that are ruining my country , anyone who is holding a gun and shooting no matter which side they 're on			0
those who stole my childhood and that of so many others			1
my dream was to apply to universities with my friends as well as cry tears of joy when we threw our graduation hats in the air			0
now that was crushed to pieces			0
one part of me , knows that this is n't good bye , and that no matter where this crazy world takes us when the time is right we will return			0
another part of me is scared that more people will die , even if they are not close to me			0
everyone has a family , friends and they suffering			1
i am scared that i will lose the hope that i now have about being able to return , and being left with nothing but memories .			1
