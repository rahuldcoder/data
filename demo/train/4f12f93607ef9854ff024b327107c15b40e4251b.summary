-- a test of the @entity3 ' only long - range missile defense system failed wednesday -- the second failure this year in two tries			1
the @entity7 's @entity6 said both the intermediate - range ballistic missile target and the long - range interceptor missile launched successfully , radar and sensors worked properly and the " kill vehicle " deployed			1
but the " kill vehicle " did n't hit the target			1
" program officials will conduct an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the failure to intercept the target , " the agency said			0
" the next flight test will be determined after identification of the cause of the failure			0
" the last test , in january , failed because of a problem with the sea - based x-band radar , the agency said			1
the x-band radar sits atop a modified floating oil platform and provides information about incoming missiles so military officials can launch a response			0
in both wednesday 's test and the test launched earlier this year , the target missile launched from @entity34 in the @entity35 , and the interceptor launched from @entity37 , @entity38			2
the $ 100 billion missile shield program has had numerous problems			0
in december 2008 , an interceptor launched from @entity43 " killed " a target launched from @entity45 , @entity46			0
but the test was n't able to determine a key aspect -- whether the interceptor could tell the difference between a decoy and a real missile -- because the decoy failed to launch			2
@entity53 , chairman and founder of the @entity55 , a nonpartisan organization that advocates for the deployment of missile defense systems , said the failure " is a tremendous setback , " noting three major test failures in the past two years			2
@entity53 said many of the country 's interceptors are nearly identical to the one that failed wednesday , and he questioned the military 's confidence in the ground - based system deployed in @entity46 and @entity38			1
so far , the @entity7 has deemed eight of the program 's 15 tests successful .			0

@entity6 is investigating how the " kill vehicle " missed the target
a *similar* test in january failed because of a problem with sea - based radar
nearly half of the systems tests have failed
