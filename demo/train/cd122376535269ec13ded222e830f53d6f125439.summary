@entity0 , @entity1 -- a rambling , 1,500 - page manifesto purportedly written by the suspect in friday 's deadly terror attacks in @entity1 lays out right - wing extremist views and vows that a " @entity12 civil war " will lead to the execution of " cultural marxists " and the banishing of @entity10			1
" if you are concerned about the future of @entity15 you will definitely find the information both interesting and highly relevant , " the author writes , adding later that his " @entity18 " took him nine years to complete			2
while the title page of the document says " by @entity24 , " the writer later identifies himself as @entity22 , the suspect in the @entity1 terrorist attacks			1
the document -- part political diatribe , part confessional and part action plan -- also contains a link to an online video post with the same title			1
@entity2 could not independently verify that @entity22 wrote the document or posted the 12 - minute video , and @entity1 authorities would not confirm that the man in their custody wrote the manifesto , saying it was part of their investigation			1
police told the @entity1 newspaper @entity42 that the document is " linked " to friday 's attacks			1
text in the video rails against the " @entity47 " of @entity15 and " cultural marxists " and asserts that the majority of @entity15 's population will be @entity10 by 2050 " unless we manage to defeat the ruling @entity52			1
" " celebrate us , the martyrs of the conservative revolution , for we will soon dine in the @entity57 , " the video says			2
parts of the document use the same wording as the 35,000 - word anti-technology manifesto written by " @entity62 " @entity62 and published in the @entity63 in 1995			1
in one passage , the document published online last week uses the same wording as the @entity62 's manifesto , but substitutes the phrase " cultural @entity69 " where @entity62 used the word " leftist , " and uses the word " muslims " where @entity62 used the phrase " black people			1
" the document contains some of the same @entity76 rhetoric that has become a part of mainstream debate in @entity1 , according to @entity79 , a @entity80 researcher at the @entity81 who studies right - wing political movements in @entity83			1
" what you see here is this new @entity12 phenomenon of this anti-islamic rhetoric , where it 's not only the immigrants ( who are enemies )			2
in fact , the main enemy is the political elite , " he said			0
" they argue that this political elite has betrayed their own country			0
" but the writer takes such philosophies to another level , he said			2
" it 's part of the same stream of ideas , but it 's still very different in terms of extremeness , " @entity79 said			2
@entity1 authorities have said they are still trying to determine the motive behind the terror attacks			0
in the manifesto , the author vilifies prime minister @entity114 and his @entity115 , which has majority control in @entity1 's government , accusing the party of perpetuating " cultural marxist / multiculturalist ideals " and indoctrinating youth with those ideals			1
the author accuses the @entity115 of embracing those ideals and therefore allowing the " @entity47 of @entity15			2
" the manifesto speculates about would happen if the author were to survive " a successful mission and live to stand a multiculturalist trial			1
" " not only will all my friends and family detest me and call me a monster ; the united global multiculturalist media will have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate , vilify and demonize , " it says			0
the manifesto and videoinclude photos that appear to match those of the suspect , some of which had been posted on his @entity141 page and several never - before - seen images of the same man			1
the author leaves clues about his family and background , and also indicates that @entity148 is his " secondary language			2
" the document and video are titled " 2083 : a @entity12 @entity157 , " a date that the author later explains is the year he believes an @entity12 civil war will end with the execution of cultural marxists and the deportation of @entity10			1
this " civil war " would come in three phases , he predicts			0
the first runs through 2030 and includes " open source warfare , military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems ( and ) further consolidation of conservative forces			0
" between 2030 and 2070 , he calls for " more advanced forms of resistance groups ( and the ) preparation of pan-european coup d'etats			0
" the final stage features the deposition of @entity15 's leaders and " implementation of a cultural conservative political agenda			2
" the author does not specifically explain why he chose the date 2083 , though it is the 200th anniversary of the death of @entity177			2
the manifesto and video also containphotos of @entity22 in what appear to be uniforms , including one in which he is wearing a @entity185 dress jacket decorated with an @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 medals			1
another picture shows @entity22 dressed in a wet suit with a patch that reads " @entity194 " and holding a high - powered rifle			1
the author states that he was moved to action dating to " my government 's involvement " in @entity200 's 1999 strikes during the @entity202 campaign , claiming this wrongly targeted " our @entity205 brothers ( who ) wanted to drive @entity207 out by deporting the @entity208 @entity10 back to @entity208			1
" he also criticizes " my government 's cowardly handling of the @entity212 cartoon issue " -- a reference to the @entity1 government 's apology for the nation 's private newspapers having repeatedly published the controversial cartoon			0
another reference blasts @entity1 , home of the @entity221 awards , for awarding a peace prize to late @entity224 leader @entity223			0
the author details his bomb - making experiments , including a theory that one should purchase a farm so that purchase of large amounts of fertilizer -- which can be used to make bombs -- is less likely to be noticed			1
" be extra careful when researching for bomb schematics ( fertilizer bombs ) , as many terms will trigger electronic alerts , " he writes , one of several tips that include using an " anonymous laptop and browse free to your local @entity240 " in order to " avoid ending up on any watch list			0
" besides hands - on instructions , the document also functions as a running diary			1
it also includes references to his relatives ' sexual indiscretions , entries on some of his friends ' personal lives , and his own off - and - on steroid use			0
from july 2 on , though , the author becomes more business - like and complains that going off his testosterone supplements had ramped up his " aggressiveness			1
" he then digs up his guns and prepares the bombs			0
it all leads up to july 22 , the date of the @entity1 terror attacks			0
" the old saying ' if you want something done , then do it yourself ' is as relevant now as it was then , " he writes			0
" in many cases ; you could do it all yourself , it will just take a little more time			0
and , without taking unacceptable risks			0
" i believe this will be my last entry			0
it is now fri july 22nd , 12.51			0
" less than three hours later , a bomb went off in downtown @entity0			0
@entity2 's @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and journalist @entity283 contributed to this report .			0
