@entity0 -- a sudden surge of pirate attacks off the coast of eastern @entity5 in recent days has prompted the @entity7 military to put out a new alert to mariners , warning of increased danger in the region			1
international naval patrols have been stepped up in the @entity13 following increased pirate attacks			0
the warning came shortly before a @entity7 - flagged ship was believed hijacked early wednesday off @entity5			1
the pirate attacks , which took place south of the area patrolled by @entity7 and coalition ships , shows pirates are changing their tactics and taking advantage of tens of thousands of square miles of open water where fewer military ships patrol , according to @entity7 military officials			1
" they [ pirates ] are going where we are not , they are looking for targets where there is limited coalition presence , " according to a @entity7 military briefing document shown to @entity1			1
coalition ships mainly patrol in the busy sea lanes of the @entity13 between @entity36 and northern @entity5 as ships come out of and head toward the mouth of the @entity40			2
" despite increased naval presence in the region , ships and aircraft are unlikely to be close enough to provide support to vessels under attack			1
the scope and magnitude of the problem can not be understated , " according to a news release from the @entity52			0
between january and february , only two pirate attacks were reported off the east coast of @entity5 , according to the @entity55 , which tracks piracy attacks worldwide			1
in march , attacks in the same area spiked to 15 , according to the bureau , and the attacks have continued into april			1
on monday , pirates seized a @entity63 - owned cargo ship in the @entity13			2
also on monday , a fishing trawler was hijacked and used to hijack other fishing vessels in the area , the bureau said			2
pirates typically use small boats with a limited range to attack ships just a few miles off the coastline			2
the new warning says recent attacks have occurred hundreds of miles off the coast , suggesting that pirates are using more " mother ships " -- a practice of using bigger boats with longer range to launch smaller pirate ships from farther out to sea , according to @entity78 officials			2
the @entity7 @entity86 's @entity85 also issued a warning to mariners april 1			0
" recent activity suggests that pirate activity off the east coast of @entity5 has increased			0
attacks have occurred more than 400 nautical miles offshore , " according to the warning			0
the warning suggests ships traveling along the coast of @entity5 and @entity95 move to the east side of the @entity97 and @entity98 , hundreds of miles east of those coastlines			0
@entity78 officials say pirates are holding 15 ships off the @entity5 coast			1
and according to @entity52 statistics , pirates attacked four ships between saturday and monday			2
the area involved -- off the coast of @entity5 and @entity95 as well as the @entity13 -- equals more than 1.1 million square miles , roughly four times the size of @entity110 , or the size of the @entity112 and @entity40 combined			0
the length of the @entity5 coastline is roughly the same length as the entire @entity115 of the @entity7 , according to @entity52 statistics			1
" we continue to highlight the importance of preparation by the merchant mariners and the maritime industry in this message , " vice adm. @entity116 , commander of the @entity117 , said in a statement			0
" international naval forces alone will not be able to solve the problem of piracy at sea			0
piracy is a problem that starts ashore , " he said			0
this year , the @entity52 started @entity131 , a multinational coalition that uses naval ships to fight piracy in the @entity13 region			0
@entity52 officials say about 12 to 15 coalition ships are patrolling in the @entity13 and the off the coast of @entity5 .			1
