-- @entity1 worshiped @entity3 hero @entity2 , @entity4 revered @entity6 winner @entity5 while @entity7 idolized @entity9 champion @entity8			2
but all @entity10 had to look up to when he was growing up was his dad -- a sushi restaurant owner			2
nonetheless , determination and desire drove the 26 - year - old to the top of @entity9 and on sunday , he became the first local driver to stand on the podium at a @entity20 @entity19 since @entity21 in 1990 -- and only the third man from his country to finish in the top three at an @entity26 race at all			1
" when i was growing up , i had nobody who i really wanted to be , " @entity10 , who now lies 11th in the drivers ' championship standings , told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			2
" i had no idea who the racers were , since my father just has a sushi restaurant and i never really watched a race			0
i maybe saw some @entity38 races or whatever but i did n't care who the driver was -- i just wanted to drive the car			0
that was my only dream when i started			0
" latest @entity9 standings @entity10 's appreciation of @entity9 was hindered by both the inconvenient broadcast times of many of the races ( particularly those in @entity50 ) and by being the only member of his family with any interest in motorsport			1
at one point , he even turned his thoughts to entertaining a very different kind of audience			0
" i wanted to become a comedian -- @entity60 is quite popular for @entity20 comedians			2
but i found i was n't talented enough , " @entity10 told the sport 's official website last month			1
instead , comedy 's questionable loss is undoubtedly @entity26 's gain with the ever - smiling @entity68 driver -- affectionately nicknamed " @entity72 " and " @entity73 " by sections of the media , and " absolutely crazy " by a smiling @entity71 -- proving a popular figure on the circuit			1
and his exploits at @entity77 , where @entity7 took the checkered flag to move just four points behind championship leader @entity80 after the @entity81 retired early on , may just have inspired a new generation of @entity20 drivers			2
the fans who thronged the famous track on sunday had a nervy wait to see the first podium by a @entity20 driver since @entity89 in 2004 as @entity10 had to fend off a determined attempt by @entity71 to pass him in the final laps			1
chants of " @entity93 " broke out from the grandstands as he was introduced at the post-race awards ceremony , before @entity26 's only @entity20 driver was eventually chased to his garage by delirious fans who had managed to infiltrate the paddock			1
" this i can not put into words			0
it was a fantastic feeling to see all the people in my home country so emotional and happy , " was how the @entity60 - born @entity10 described his first podium to @entity68 's official website			1
" it gave me such a lot and i will never forget that moment			0
i want to thank the @entity20 fans for the great support they gave to the @entity68 and to myself			1
" prior to the race , @entity10 had told @entity0 he believed the presence of so many impassioned supporters would not put him under pressure but simply give him more power			2
so it proved , as he completed his greatest @entity9 triumph just a couple of hours ' drive from his home town -- sparking a huge party at @entity77 on sunday night , with another celebratory event at the same venue attracting 5,000 fans on monday morning			1
the timing of @entity10 's success was perfect , not only because the driver 's future with @entity68 is uncertain but also because of @entity20 's reduced investment in @entity9 in recent years			1
since 2008 , economic reasons have prompted both @entity132 and @entity26 to withdraw from the constructors ' championship and @entity135 to opt against renewing its contract to supply tires to @entity26 teams			0
" i hope that with this kind of result there is fresh impetus for companies to come in			0
it 's very important for the race in @entity20 , for @entity9 in the country , because now they have a driver who has given such a great performance , " says @entity68 team principal @entity145			1
yet @entity10 's place on the podium did not come easily , with a man who was appointed an international ambassador for sports and tourism by the @entity20 government in september having long battled the odds to calmber to the top of @entity9			1
even though his parents -- who choose not to own a car -- had limited interest in motorsport , his father , whose sushi delivery business is based in @entity60 , backed @entity93 in the well - worn path of go - karting when he was just nine			2
" sushi restaurants are a completely different world to racing but i just really wanted to do racing and it felt like destiny when i started , " explained @entity10			0
" my father was always supporting me but it was very difficult at the beginning because racing is quite expensive and it cost more than we expected			0
it was a really hard time but when i got a chance with @entity26 , it was a great start and i gradually improved step - by - step until i progressed to @entity9			2
" after signing for @entity26 's @entity182 in 2004 , @entity10 graduated to being a @entity26 test driver before finally contesting his first @entity9 drive in 2009			1
" in my time , there was a lot of support from manufacturers towards young drivers but now it 's really difficult to find that , " he says with a deep sense of gratitude			0
" we had belief though , good results and kept working really hard to achieve the dream of becoming an @entity9 driver			2
in any job , talent is very important but the most important thing is to never give up			0
" this quality served @entity10 well when @entity26 retired from @entity9 three years ago , a decision which even found him thinking about working for his father 's sushi business despite his stated dislike of raw fish			1
but the @entity20 's skills , hard work and aggressive driving style were rewarded when @entity68 picked him up shortly after			1
" i think we 're improving every year and this year , our car is really strong even though our budget stopped			0
after @entity214 left @entity68 ( in 2009 ) , we spent a really difficult time but we 're working hard every year and the car is getting more amazing , " he says			0
this was proven when @entity10 's speed meant that only double world champion @entity7 and @entity220 's @entity219 finished ahead of him on sunday , a day when he believes he came of age			1
" i 've always felt that if you ever want to look back and regard yourself as an @entity9 driver , you have to have been on the podium at least once , " he told @entity68 's website			1
" without such a photo , it 's a bit as if you had never been there			0
so it means a lot to me			0
" i instantly relaxed when ( i crossed the line and ) all the pressure came off			0
without doubt it was a very important race for me in my career			0
and i felt : yes , now we will be having more strong races and really go for 5th place in the constructors ' championship			0
" sixth - placed @entity68 's 116 points are 20 fewer than @entity242 and while he battles for his team , @entity10 needs a strong finish in the season 's five remaining races to not just continue his hard - fought @entity26 career but also to provide a hero for @entity20 's next generation .			1

@entity10 thanks @entity77 fans for support after sunday 's podium finish
his third - place finish at @entity77 only the third by a @entity20 driver in @entity9 *history*
@entity68 driver believes he can now regard himself ' as a formula 1 driver ' after sunday 's feat
@entity68 chief hopes @entity10 feat can inspire a *resurgence* of @entity20 interest in the sport
