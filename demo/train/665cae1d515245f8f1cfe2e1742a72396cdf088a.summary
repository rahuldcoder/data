-- remember the time @entity2 broke a guitar ? @entity4 does			1
he 's the musician who three years ago turned his misfortune into an internet sensation			1
his video , " @entity8 , " got a million views in just four days and prompted the airline to offer him compensation			1
but despite struggling with the airline for months , @entity4 turned down the money because he wanted something bigger : he wanted to reform the system			1
@entity4 is not the first angry customer to take his complaints online			1
rants abound on video sharing sites ; many feature nothing more than the offended party on a webcam spinning a tale of woe			2
that 's what made @entity4 's video stand out			1
the @entity30 crooner spent seven months putting together a song and video			1
his real time and real talent combined to make something that people could really enjoy			2
" if you are ranting or raving , people will listen for a second , but they wo n't want to join your cause , " @entity4 explains			1
after months of struggling with @entity2 , that 's what @entity4 had -- a cause			1
@entity45 's @entity44 has a cause , too			1
he covers all things consumer - related and to @entity4 's advice , he suggests adding another element : " something that makes people laugh and makes them angry at the same time			1
" one @entity53 couple , @entity52 and @entity54 , recently learned first hand how this mix of outrage and humor can get the public on your side and sway a large corporation			1
their story starts about six months ago when the newlyweds found themselves in a rather intractable situation trying to buy their first home			2
" we knew that the people we were dealing with were n't hateful people , " @entity54 recalls , but along their 78 - day odyssey they could n't help but wonder			1
after meeting in graduate school , the couple got married and moved to @entity53			0
then came time to buy their first home			1
the two had good jobs , steady income and they wanted to buy a modest home within their financial reach			2
" we put in an offer on september 8th			0
we wanted to close -- we were told we would close , " @entity52 recalls			0
but when " we came up to october 7th , and nothing was appearing to be falling place			0
" sitting around their dining room table , @entity52 and @entity54 rattle off all the missed deadlines and infuriating delays that tangled up their lives for weeks on end			1
they say paperwork would n't make it to the correct office , phone calls and e-mails would go unreturned			0
one of their bank contacts even quit and failed to pass along their file ; " her e-mails just started bouncing " @entity54 says , shaking her head at the memory			1
all the while the couple scrambled to meet the sellers ' demands while living out of boxes			0
" we were ready to unpack , " @entity54 says			1
early on , when things first started going wrong , they saved e-mails			0
so after missing the projected closing date , with fees beginning to pile up and only radio silence from the bank , they turned their in - boxes into a weapon			0
" i just thought we just have to do something -- there is some kind of power we can leverage " @entity54 says			1
so while she hit the keyboard to share the story on their blog , @entity52 picked up his guitar			2
two hours later , he emerged , " he was like , ' i wrote a song , ' " @entity54 giggles			1
what started with a song became a custom video featuring the couple and their cats , pleading with @entity141 to the tune of " @entity143 , you got it @entity133 " from the @entity144 show " @entity145			1
" " the goal was never to get thousands of people to tweet , " @entity54 says			2
that 's a good thing because the video did n't exactly go viral ( nothing close to @entity4 's million views ) , but it did get a good deal of attention			1
local news outlets picked up the couple 's story and within 48 hours , the bank got in touch			0
they now had the ear of top people at the bank			0
with that , their hopeless situation , weeks of unreturned phone calls and volumes of paperwork came to a close			0
" we wrote the song on day 72 and posted it on day 74 and we closed on day 79 , " @entity52 says			0
their prize , a charming brick bungalow on a quiet street , is small and neat			0
as the couple walk through , they sound like many new homeowners pointing out all the projects			0
" there must have been a fire sale on molding " says @entity54 , gesturing toward the oak - filled kitchen			2
some big things needed work too			0
the couple put in new wiring , duct work and plumbing			0
these projects are n't flashy or exciting , but the pair shows them off with pride			0
that construction , in part , explains what held up their loan , says @entity199 , a @entity141 spokesman			0
the @entity200 applied for a 203 ( k ) loan , which allows for renovations			0
@entity199 says this type of loan can actually take some 90 days to close			0
realtors and mortgage brokers confirmed that 203 ( k ) loans typically take much longer to close than a standard loan			0
@entity199 did apologize for other hang - ups in the @entity54 ' case , and he said the couple 's experience prompted " a tightening of procedures " at the bank			1
the combination of humor and an outrageous story got the @entity54 the attention they needed			2
the combination worked for @entity4 too			2
his efforts not only got him offers of compensation but even now , three years on , he travels around the world bringing his mix of music and message to places such as @entity229 , @entity230 and soon @entity231			0
he also published a book about his experience and launched a website , @entity235 , that helps people elevate and escalate their problems			0
looking back , both the @entity238 and @entity4 say the intent behind the video is as important to getting noticed as the message			1
" i 'm not against companies , i 'm not trying to take down companies , " @entity4 says			2
rather , they agree , it 's about giving companies and the people who work for them the opportunity to make things right			0
but even if a viral video does n't get you want you want , all three say the process affords a measure of control -- something they 'd lost in what @entity4 calls the " customer service maze " and @entity54 called the " black hole of customer service			1
" so it 's no surprise that all three say they would make another video if they found themselves in a similar situation			2
for others contemplating going this route , @entity4 says " make sure that you are fair and you are articulate and you are creative and that your story resonates with other people			2
" it also does n't hurt to be good with a guitar .			0

@entity54 and @entity274 made a video in *exasperation* after home loan delays
@entity4 's song about an airline breaking his guitar became a web sensation
@entity4 advises that complaint videos be light on *vitriol* , heavy on facts
@entity45 's @entity44 says the videos should be funny and infuriating at the same time
