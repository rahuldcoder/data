@entity0 -- for all the discord the @entity3 administration sowed on the world stage -- withdrawing from the @entity6 and various arms agreements , holding foreign nationals indefinitely at @entity9 with restricted rights , generally disdaining multilateralism -- the previous president was rightfully celebrated for his commitment to fighting the global @entity15 epidemic			1
in the four years following the unprecedented creation in 2004 of the funding mechanism known as @entity18 ( president 's @entity18 ) , @entity3 sent some $ 19 billion to @entity20 and other hard - hit parts of the world			1
how much has the @entity24 administration added this year ? only $ 366 million beyond the prior year 's level			1
it does n't come close to the $ 1 billion a year the current president promised to add as a candidate			1
that @entity29 president @entity3 was a bigger advocate on @entity15 than " liberal " @entity24 may come as a surprise , but many people around the world are starting to notice the discrepancy			1
that includes @entity35 , the former archbishop of @entity36 and @entity38 laureate			1
on wednesday , @entity35 took the president to task in a sharply worded @entity42 op - ed that noted substantially fewer additional @entity20 @entity44 patients will receive treatment than did under @entity3 if the funding slack persists			1
indeed , according to two @entity51 researchers , if aid is n't substantially increased over bush - era levels , an estimated 1.2 million avoidable deaths could occur just in @entity20 over the next five years			0
that would happen on @entity24 's watch			1
domestically , the news is n't much better			0
when @entity24 rolled out his ballyhooed national hiv / aids strategy last week , there was no new funding attached , just a mandate to re-allocate existing funds to the communities most in need and the tactics that work best			1
( for all his global generosity , @entity3 was rightly knocked stateside for prioritizing abstinence - based prevention approaches over condom - based ones			2
the needs of gay men , one of the most affected groups of @entity69 , were largely left out of the playbook altogether because of pressure from the @entity73 right			2
) read about men who have survived 30 years with @entity44 but for all the innovative ideas in the strategy document , such as using social media to raise awareness of hiv / aids , what we really need is money			2
the federal / state @entity83 , which provides @entity44 drugs to more than 200,000 uninsured and underinsured people , has a wait list of some 2,300 people			0
and it 's growing monthly			0
that 's too many @entity69 going without medicines that can save their lives			1
meanwhile , the number of people living with @entity15 in the @entity69 -- more than 1 million -- continues to rise			1
in some cities , the situation is as bad as parts of @entity20			0
in @entity97 , 3 percent of residents have @entity15			2
of course , in many parts of @entity20 , the statistics are much more dire			0
in @entity20 , some 5.7 million people are @entity44 - positive			0
that 's 11 percent of the population			0
but you would n't believe how few federal dollars go to finding a cure : just $ 40 million in 2009 , according to the @entity106			0
i know the country is lurching back from recession and funds across the board are tight			0
but if the administration can approve hundreds of billions of dollars for stimulus spending or health care reform -- let alone the countless billions of dollars wasted by a bloated intelligence infrastructure -- then the @entity112 can certainly commit a fraction of these amounts to help out an even worthier cause : people 's well - being			2
it takes vigilance to beat back the @entity15 scourge , to make sure people with @entity44 get the treatment they need to survive , and that people without the virus stay free of it			2
we 've made important strides in recent years			0
just this week , the promising results of a @entity20 microbicide trial were announced , meaning that down the road women may be able to protect themselves from the virus without a vaccine			0
but there 's still a lot to do			0
if @entity69 cuts back on aid , other countries will , too , because we 're the pacesetter			1
the @entity24 administration defends itself by saying the @entity69 is the world 's biggest financial contributor to the fight against hiv / aids			1
as important as that is , we need to keep up with the epidemic , which requires more resources every year			0
@entity24 should listen to his fellow @entity149 , who helped lead his country out of apartheid , and lead the way on ending this scourge , both globally and here at home			2
after all , he wants posterity to judge him more favorably than @entity3 , right ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			1

@entity3 set *standard* for increasing @entity69 aid to fight @entity15 , says @entity160
he says president @entity24 has not lived up to his promise to add $ 1 billion more to the fight
@entity160 says national commitment to fighting @entity15 needs *strengthening*
he says @entity24 should *respond* to @entity35 's call for spending more on hiv / aids
