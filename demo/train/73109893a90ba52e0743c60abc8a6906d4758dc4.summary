@entity0 -- @entity3 telecommunications companies are trying to put some distance between themselves and @entity3 government spying programs after years of quietly complying with court orders to cooperate with @entity8 surveillance			1
the @entity10 administration on wednesday released a set of declassified court documents showing that in 2010 , a @entity3 telecom company pushed the government to prove the legality of the @entity8 's bulk collection of data on @entity3 phone calls			1
the so - called phone metadata program , authorized under @entity20 of the @entity21 , became public last year in documents leaked by former @entity8 contractor @entity23			0
since the @entity23 disclosures , telecommucations providers have come under criticism from privacy advocates for not fighting hard enough to protect their customers ' data from the government 's mass surveillance programs			2
some technology companies have complained that their compliance , under court order , with @entity3 surveillance programs has caused customers to distrust them and could harm their business and the @entity3 economy			2
in january , after a pair of conflicting federal court rulings on the legality of the data program , @entity40 questioned the @entity45 about the legal basis for the program			0
the court turned away the challenge and ordered the company to continue complying			0
the documents released wednesday show there was an earlier , more modest effort in 2010 made by at least one provider to push the government to explain the legality of the data collection			1
wednesday 's declassification came after the company , unidentified in the partially redacted court documents made public , pressed the government to release the 2010 court records , according to people familiar with the matter			1
the name of company remains classified , but an official familiar with the matter confirmed it was @entity69			0
the @entity70 first reported the name of the company and said the company 's lawyers were prepared in 2010 to challenge the @entity8 program 's legality until the government more fully explained it			1
sprint is pleased with the release of the records , spokesman @entity75 said			0
" @entity69 believes that substantive legal grounding should be provided when the government requests customer information from carriers , " he said			0
" @entity69 has a longstanding commitment to protecting our customers ' privacy and will challenge an order for customer information that we do n't think complies with the law			0
" this is an important part of the debate in how our government balances the need to provide for our national security while protecting civil liberties , " @entity75 continued			0
" @entity69 also believes this balance can be achieved without obligating carriers to keep customer information any longer than necessary for legitimate business purposes			0
" with ongoing @entity23 document disclosures , the company sought the declassification to show it did n't blindly go along with government spying , according to a @entity3 official familiar with the matter			2
the 2010 records show the dispute fell short of a full court challenge of the @entity8 data collection			1
but documents show the company pushed the government into negotiations to provide more information about the legality of the program			1
in the end , the documents show , a federal judge on the @entity45 ordered the company to continue to comply with the @entity8 's programs			1
