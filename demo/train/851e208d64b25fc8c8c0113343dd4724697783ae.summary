-- @entity2 's governor has unilaterally imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in his state , saying tuesday there are " too many doubts " and " too many flaws " raised about its application			1
in a statement , gov. @entity11 said he is suspending executions while he is in office , meaning he will issue reprieves when any capital cases come to his desk for action			1
he said his decision comes after a months - long internal review that included input from law enforcement and families of murder victims			2
@entity11 concluded the death penalty was inconsistently applied			1
" equal justice under the law is the state 's primary responsibility			1
and in death penalty cases , i 'm not convinced equal justice is being served , " the first - term @entity31 governor said			1
" the use of the death penalty in this state is unequally applied , sometimes dependent on the budget of the county where the crime occurred			1
" the governor 's executive action will not definitively end future use of capital punishment in @entity2 -- that would take action from the legislature or voters -- nor will death row sentences automatically be commuted or pardons issued			1
nine murderers , all men , remain on @entity2 's death row , at @entity51			1
five men have been executed since 1976 , when the @entity53 allowed the practice to resume			0
two of the condemned inmates died by hanging , in 1993 and 1994			0
the last execution in the state was in 2010 , according to the @entity60			2
lethal injection remains the primary method , but a shortage of drugs nationwide has led other states to seek new pharmaceutical sources and methods , or effectively postpone executions			2
@entity11 said his action had nothing to do with mercy			1
" let me say clearly that this policy decision is not about the nine men on death row in @entity51 , " he said			2
" i do n't question their guilt or the gravity of their crimes			0
they get no mercy from me			0
this action does not commute their sentences or issue any pardons to any offender			0
but i do not believe their horrific offenses override the problems that exist in our capital punishment system			0
" state law gives @entity11 the authority to stop death warrants from being issued			1
civil rights groups applauded the move			0
" this announcement marks an important step forward for @entity2 , and is a victory for the @entity101 - @entity101 community			2
nowhere are disparities between black and white inmates in criminal justice more apparent than in sentences deciding who lives and who dies , " said @entity102 , the president of the @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity105 of the @entity106			0
" @entity101 residents are disproportionately represented on death row , and our state is more likely to impose the death penalty on @entity101 defendants than white defendants convicted of the same crime			1
" eighteen states have officially banned capital punishment as a matter of law , including the @entity125			2
seven others have had a moratorium imposed either by the courts or the governor			0
among them was @entity104 in 2011			0
" it is time for @entity104 to consider a different approach			0
i refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer ; and i will not allow further executions while i am governor , " said @entity133 , a @entity134			0
both of @entity104 's executions since the @entity53 allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976 happened during @entity133 's first administration as governor , from 1995 - 2003 .			1
