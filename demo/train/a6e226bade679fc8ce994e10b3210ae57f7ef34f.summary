@entity0 -- the @entity3 is replacing its much - mocked system of color - coded terrorism alerts with detailed advisories about specific threats , homeland security secretary @entity2 announced thursday			1
" when we have information about a specific , credible threat , we will issue a formal alert providing as much information as we can , " @entity8 said			1
that information will include a summary of the threat , steps authorities are taking to guard the public and what the public can do , she said			1
" the alerts will be specific to the threat			2
they may recommend certain actions or suggest looking for specific suspicious behavior			0
and they will have a specified end date , " @entity8 said in a speech at @entity26			1
@entity8 's formal announcement confirmed reports that emerged wednesday			2
the new system , set to take effect in late april , replaces the five - color system established after @entity34 's september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity36 and @entity0			1
@entity8 said those warnings were " too often accompanied by little practical information			1
" the new system , she said , is built on the idea " that we are all in this together , and that we all have a role to play			0
" the five - color system has rarely changed from its middle setting of yellow , or " elevated , " for the general public and orange , or " high , " for commercial aviation			1
it has not been lowered below those levels since its establishment in 2002			0
the system was the butt of jokes and parodies almost from the start , and polls found that the public considered it confusing			2
@entity61 , of the airline travelers ' advocacy group @entity62 , called it " very useless			2
" " people just ignored it , " @entity65 told @entity1 on wednesday			0
since the color rarely changed , passengers came to believe it did n't mean anything , she said			0
in addition , some critics accused the @entity75 administration of manipulating the system to gin up fear at politically sensitive times			2
just days after he announced his resignation in 2005 , then - homeland security secretary @entity80 told a @entity0 forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the administration 's @entity86 , which made the decisions			0
the @entity75 administration denied @entity80 's assertions			0
@entity8 said the new system " is built on a clear and simple premise : when a threat develops that could impact you -- the public -- we will tell you			1
" the alerts will distinguish between " elevated " and " imminent " threats and could be limited to warnings for specific industries or police or communicated more broadly to the public , she said			1
the yellow alert was raised to orange five times for the nation as a whole and three times for specific industries			0
the orange alert for aviation was raised to red once , in august 2006 , and only for flights from @entity114 to the @entity3			0
the alert followed the announcement by @entity114 authorities that they had disrupted a major plot to blow up jetliners , and it was lowered back to orange six days later .			0

" specific , credible threats " will be *outlined* to the public , @entity8 says
the warnings will include detailed information and have an end date
critics called the five - color system confusing and " very useless "
