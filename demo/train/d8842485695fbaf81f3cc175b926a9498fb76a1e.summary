@entity0 -- the nation 's powerful gun lobby has faced headwinds from vocal lawmakers , a galvanized presidential administration and an @entity8 electorate that polls show favors tougher gun laws following december 's school massacre in @entity13			1
yet , when the hundreds of hours of legislative debate , on camera pleas , backroom negotiations and intense lobbying have ended , groups like the @entity15 may find that they have narrowed the scope of gun control legislation			1
" if you have 100 missiles coming at you and you knock out 99 , i would say you were successful , " @entity22 , president of the gun rights group , the @entity24 , said of efforts by gun rights groups			1
" after the @entity34 massacre , i was very worried , " said @entity22 , who served as regional political director for the @entity15 during its rise to power in the 1980s			0
" the talk was about an assault weapons ban , a gun registry , background checks			1
everything was on the table			0
but the only thing legislatively coming down the pike , the only thing we 're talking about is background checks			1
i would count that as a success for the @entity15 , " he added			0
@entity49 gun law proposal lacks enough support now the @entity49 has taken up legislation backed by president @entity52 and many democrats that would toughen laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases , and devise ways to improve school safety			1
a bipartisan compromise by sens. @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62 , @entity63 , to expand background checks is the first item up for debate			2
but @entity60 said on monday that it did n't have enough support yet			2
a minimum of 60 votes are needed to clear procedural hurdles			0
as things stand now , supporters need at least seven votes from @entity74 , the party most closely aligned with @entity15 views on gun rights			2
though smaller gun rights groups , such as the @entity78 , support the measure , the @entity15 reiterated its threat to hold those who back the compromise politically accountable			1
the @entity15 exerts political clout through a rating system that identifies friends and foes of its positions in @entity90			0
it directs substantial contributions to political campaigns it favors or opponents of candidates it dislikes			0
the @entity15 was also able to marshal its large and active membership base to press lawmakers on the upcoming gun vote			1
" @entity15 is opposed to @entity104 , and it will be a scored vote , " @entity15 spokesman @entity100 said , meaning lawmaker ratings with the organization will be affected by how they vote			0
a high rating is a political plus for congressional lawmakers from conservative states or districts , especially those up for re-election in 2014			2
" there is a lot of member contact going on right now that is n't so obvious , " said @entity113 , dean and professor at the @entity115 at @entity117 's @entity116			2
" this is n't one of those debates where we 're seeing a lot of ads. but this is where groups like the @entity15 are strong at using members in states to reach out to lawmakers , " he said			2
gun rights group endorses background check deal the @entity15 's message both in public and private conversations with lawmakers is clear			1
" the @entity15 is forever			0
your vote on that issue is forever			0
and when the next election comes along we 're going to talk about that , " @entity113 said of the @entity15 's message to lawmakers			1
the @entity60 - @entity62 amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws pushed by president @entity52 following the shooting deaths of 20 first - graders and six educators at the @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity13			2
in debate expected to last two weeks , senators will consider efforts by both sides to either expand or weaken the gun package			1
key issues that had some momentum coming out of @entity153 but are fiercely opposed by the @entity15 appear to have a slim chance of passage			0
these include a @entity165 - driven push for banning semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds			2
republicans will push an @entity15 proposal to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable throughout the country , a concept opposed by many @entity176			0
the assault weapons proposal by sen. @entity180 , the @entity60 - @entity62 compromise and the plan around concealed weapons will all be up for votes beginning on wednesday as amendments , senate majority leader @entity177 said			1
the powerful gun lobby and its allies in @entity90 have been able to use a sophisticated campaign			1
they have consistently shifted the focus among various provisions , raised new arguments to old issues , and proposed solutions that would expand weapons use and training instead of increasing regulation			0
the gun lobby has had a hand in helping to shape or steer the direction of many amendments to the overall bill , gun policy experts say			1
take , for example , the ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons proposed by @entity180 , a @entity207 @entity165 , and backed by @entity52			0
fiercely opposed by the @entity15 , republicans and some @entity176 , @entity177 calculated that it would be best not to include it in the main bill because it would invite a filibuster			2
in the @entity213 , speaker @entity211 , @entity212 , has said the chamber would look at anything the @entity49 approved			1
but he 's not promising a vote			0
" what the @entity15 does as well if not better than any organization in this country i do what you do in the old civics courses			0
you educate your supporters , " @entity22 said			0
" you get them to communicate their views with elected officials in a targeted manner			0
" why is this so hard ? the disconnect on background checks and guns @entity1 's @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .			1

the gun lobby has beat back *challenges* from lawmakers , public opinion
background check legislation once deemed a sure thing *struggles* to gain support
gun lobby 's efforts include " activating " membership , pressuring lawmakers
new : @entity49 plans to begin voting on gun amendments on wednesday
