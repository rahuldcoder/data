@entity0 , @entity1 -- when the sun dips below the @entity4 and the streets of @entity0 go dark , @entity6 , his girlfriend @entity9 and their friend @entity10 head home			1
they climb in between the rafters of a highway overpass , crouching as they sit under the concrete structure that rumbles with every car that crosses overhead			1
it is where they will sleep tonight			1
it is where they say they can live safely after escaping from abusive homes			1
" it 's pretty hard , " says @entity9 , 18 , when asked about living on the streets			2
" but most of the time it 's just life , you know			2
life 's not going to be easy			2
" she refuses to talk about what caused her to leave home			2
her boyfriend @entity6 has a different outlook : he says he enjoys the fun and freedom of life on the streets			2
" i do n't really have to worry about anything , " says @entity6 , 20			2
" i get some food and kick back with the homies			2
" out of the three friends , @entity10 seems to be the most concerned about the future			2
he says he began living on the streets two years ago , after escaping a violent relationship with his stepfather			2
" if i defended myself against him , i always got looked at badly , " he said			2
" so when i turned 18 , i left			2
" he stops talking as he watches a homeless man walk by			1
" i 'd hate to think that 's the way i 'm going , " says @entity10			2
" that i 'm going to end up being 40 years old and on the streets			2
" getting off the streets is a daunting challenge for these young adults and others like them , who have no address , no job , very little education , and many times drug addictions and mental health issues			1
" we see a lot of kids really since age of 7 or 8 [ who ] have n't had any real roots to call their own , " according to @entity68 , spokesman for @entity69 , which helps those who are young and homeless			1
" those are the 18 - year - olds who [ have ] very limited education and really need to start from square one			1
" @entity68 , who has worked with homeless youths for 20 years , said a key goal is reaching these young adults before they " disappear into the streets			1
" " it sounds like a movie , but it 's true : pimps and traffickers , they spot these kids and go after them , " @entity68 said			1
" if we do n't get to them , many will end up on drugs or in prison			0
" the youths can be helped , he said , if they can learn to establish healthy relationships with others			1
" it 's a trust issue : most of these kids have been abused and taken advantage of by every adult they 've met , " @entity68 said			1
@entity98 is at the heart of the family that @entity6 has created for a small group of his friends living on the streets of @entity0			1
they call themselves " @entity106 " -- the name for fans of the rap group @entity110			0
but now , the name has a more important meaning			0
" @entity106 started as a family for people who feel like they do n't have family , " @entity6 explained			0
" other people see it as a gang , but we just look out for each other any way we can			0
" they mostly hang out , swimming in the @entity121 or -- if they manage to panhandle a few dollars -- buying beer or marijuana			0
most days , they eat lunch at @entity127 , which was set up in 2002 by @entity128			1
he got his street name after spending a year handing out clean socks to street kids			1
every day , about 100 young people come by to eat lunch , use the computers , watch movies and also pick up a fresh pair of socks			1
" they are just like any other kids out there , they have the same struggles , the same issues , " @entity128 said			1
" they still want love , they want acceptance , they want protections , they want rules , they want to be held accountable			0
" @entity128 said his goal is simply to provide a stable place where they can be loved for who they are			1
" i do n't try to change them , " he said			0
" if they want to change , we 're here for them			0
if they do n't want to change , we 're still going to love them			0
" @entity128 , 55 , says his @entity164 faith motivates him to help these kids , although he does n't try to push religion on anyone at @entity127			1
he says he lies awake at night after hearing their stories of abuse and neglect			0
" it shakes my faith in people , " he said			0
" how can we allow this to happen in our own country ? " read more about @entity128 's perspective on faith the @entity180 administration recently unveiled a plan to end homelessness in the @entity183 over the next decade			1
the @entity187 will " harness public and private resources to build on the innovations that have been demonstrated at the local level nationwide , " according to council chairman @entity188			0
@entity128 is skeptical about whether the government can adequately address the root causes of homelessness			1
" we need less government and more grass roots , " he said			0
" we need taxes not to go to renovating parks , but renovating lives			0
" all the government can really do is put a roof over someone 's head , he said			0
and that does n't necessarily constitute a " home			0
" " they do n't have a home , the sense of family , " @entity128 said			1
" all we 're doing is pushing them to the sides , we 're not dealing with the real issues			0
" @entity209 wandered into @entity127 one afternoon in june , a pretty young woman with an air of confidence that contrasts with the cuts across her cheek and the brace on her knee , injuries she said were inflicted by her pimp			1
" people think it 's a choice to be on the streets , but it 's never a choice , " said @entity209 , 18			0
she said she has been sexually abused since she was 6 years old and was in and out of foster care until recently			1
now , she is living in a camp with other homeless kids , hiding from her pimp			1
" yeah , it 's not a house , but a house is n't everything , " she said			0
all i ever wanted was a family			0
" she wants to go to college to study psychology and help other street kids , but she knows the odds are against her			1
" i do n't have the building blocks to get up in life , to be able to do what i need to do , because i never learned it , " she said			0
" i have to learn that on my own			0
" the odds were against @entity247 , who left home at age 12 and eventually became a member of the @entity106			0
" they were better than my own biological family , " said @entity247 , who is now 21			0
" they did n't put their hands on me , they fed me , they kept me safe , they cared about how i felt			0
" after nearly a decade on the streets , she has just gotten her first apartment with her boyfriend and is looking forward to a more stable future for her 5 - month - old daughter			1
" i have almost $ 1,000 saved up from selling plasma and doing day labor , and hopefully in the next month and a half to three months , i 'll have my ged , " she said			0
@entity247 has drawn strength from living on the streets , and she thinks others can do the same : " if you can survive off of living on the street and sleeping on cold concrete or behind a dumpster when it 's snowing , you know you have the strength to do just about anything			0
