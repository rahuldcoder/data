-- born into grinding poverty and with a degenerative eye condition which left her almost totally blind , @entity1 first became aware of her athletic abilities when fleeing a school bully in her home city of @entity8 in @entity9			1
despite her apparent disadvantage , @entity1 easily outpaced her much older would - be assailant and , as fear mixed with exhilaration , she inadvertently found her true forte in life			1
" i love to run			2
i feel free and complete , " the three - time @entity16 gold medalist told @entity0 's @entity18 series			1
" the feeling of moving fast is just magical , it 's wonderful			2
" @entity1 may have been blessed with natural talent , but the handicaps she faced on her journey to track and field stardom would have defeated most mere mortals			1
coming from a family of 12 , her mother died when she was just nine and the children were often left to forage for leftovers just to feed themselves			0
" we did n't have much to eat , our diet was always poor , " the 34 - year - old recalled			1
despite her visual impairment , @entity1 was forced to attend a regular school -- " i suffered from bullying because i was n't normal " -- and was in her early 20s before she completed her education			1
sporting dream still harboring a dream to excel at sports , the impoverished @entity1 enrolled on a disability project being run by the @entity8 city council , focusing on swimming and running			1
" i found an association that had sports for the vision - impaired			2
i joined and started to compete			0
" she initially chose swimming because she did n't own a pair of running shoes , but her sister , who worked as a maid , said " here , take mine			0
" @entity1 may have had a pair of hand - down trainers and a coach who encouraged her to compete in her first race , but her visual handicap left her at a further disadvantage			1
" i had to train when no one was around because i had no guide , " she said			0
so for fear of obstructing other runners , @entity1 took to the track when it was deserted			1
" i had to train at the hottest time , which was from 12 - 2 p.m. because there was no one around			2
i would run and run until i did 40 laps ( 16 kilometers )			0
" existing on a diet of flour and sugar , living in a house where there was no real shelter from the rain , only an incredible inner will to succeed kept her going			0
" i said i wanted to be the best in the world , i thought if i could make it , i would be able to change my future , to change my destiny , " she said			2
" i would push myself to the limits			0
i would do 70 laps and barely eat			0
" first prize @entity1 started taking part in local road races with the aim of making money to fund her activities and buy basic foodstuffs			1
" the first money that i earned made me believe that i would be able to realize all my dreams , " she said			0
" i won 80 @entity92 ( $ 40 ) in a street race , and stopped in a market to buy a yoghurt that i always dreamed of eating since i was little			2
" her ability came to the notice of @entity9 @entity16 officials and she was selected to compete in the 2004 games in @entity100 , over the distances of 400 , 800 and 1500m			1
categorized as @entity102 for athletes who have no functional vision , @entity1 was able to run with a guide , but the athlete nominated to run with her proved of little use			1
" when we got to @entity100 , the first thing he said was , ' you are on your own			0
' the night before the 400m race , he spent the whole night clubbing and during the event he almost fell ... he was more tired than i was ! " she said			1
despite the near mishap , @entity1 took the bronze medal in the 400m -- but finished down the field in the other two events			1
she realized that she was competing in the wrong races , and swapped the two longer ones for sprints over 100m and 200m			0
it proved an inspired move and , once she had mastered the skill of driving out of the starting blocks , @entity1 never looked back			1
first gold a world record in the 100m for her category came in 2007 and she won a full set of medals at the @entity134 the following year			1
her defeat in 100m was a disappointment though , as @entity138 runner @entity137 won gold			1
" i was slow getting out of the blocks and i stumbled			0
" but @entity1 made amends in the 200m to win her first @entity16 gold , and repeated her bronze of @entity100 in the 400m			1
coming into @entity146 , @entity1 was ever more confident , particularly because of the ability of her guide runner , @entity148			1
he is her seventh , having come together in 2010			0
" he 's the best guide in the world because i 'm not aware of him on the track			2
@entity148 has given me back the feeling of running by myself			0
that 's the best gift i could have			0
" the ultimate goal for 2012 was a hat - trick of @entity16 golds and , after a comfortable win in the 200m , they seemed on track			2
then disaster struck in the 400m , in one of the most heartbreaking moments of the @entity167			2
the pair looked set for victory when @entity148 fell in the finishing straight , pulling down @entity1 in full flight			1
the capacity crowd gasped in disbelief as @entity174 's @entity173 crossed the line first while the @entity9 pair lay prone on the track			2
world record in defeat , @entity1 had made the headlines and highlighted the fine line between success and failure in disability sport			1
" i felt literally blind in that moment , and that moment , he stopped being invisible to me , " she recounted			2
but it was to be expected that @entity1 would not let that setback derail her ambitions and the very next day , still " very sore from all the previous races , " she stormed to victory in the 100m in a world - record time of 12.01 seconds			1
@entity193 was restored after the bitter disappointment of just 24 hours previously , and she and @entity148 shared the glory on the podium			0
" we are a team			0
if we lose we do it together , and if we win ... we win together , " she said proudly			0
despite her advancing years -- she will be pushing 38 by the time of the @entity200 -- @entity1 is absolutely determined to compete in her three events in front of home fans and achieve the hat - trick which so cruelly eluded her			1
" i 'm going to take care of myself so that in @entity200 i can win gold medals in every race i compete			1
i intend to do better than @entity208 when it comes to my times			0
" the inspiration is performing for the last time in front of her home fans and being a role model for the next generation			0
" i feel honored to be an example for others , " she said			0
" it makes it feel worthwhile to have overcome all the challenges i have encountered so i can help others to dream and also fulfill their dreams			0
" ultimate high @entity1 describes the award of the @entity224 and @entity167 to the @entity225 as a " gift from god " which leaves her with the opportunity to go out on the ultimate high with " unforgettable moments " which could not be topped			2
her future after running is unclear , though when she was younger she had ambitions to go into the legal profession			0
fearing that her disability would lead to being discriminated against in such a profession , @entity1 opted for a sporting life			2
" i feel like i 've accomplished all my fantasies and childhood dreams , " she said			0
" i had nothing , now i have everything			0

@entity1 is the fastest blind woman runner in the world
she won two gold medals at 2012 @entity244 but fell in 400m
the 34 - year - old will *retire* after the 2016 *paralympics* in her native @entity9
@entity1 : " i had nothing , now i have everything "
