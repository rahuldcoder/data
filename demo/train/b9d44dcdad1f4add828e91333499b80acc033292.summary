-- an @entity2 man accused of murder , rape and holding three women in a @entity7 house against their will pleaded not guilty wednesday			1
his attorney said it was an effort to stave off a death penalty and an arduous trial			1
@entity13 , 52 , wore an orange jumpsuit , kept his head bowed and did n't speak as attorneys entered the plea on their client 's behalf at his brief arraignment in a @entity7 courtroom			1
he was indicted last week on 329 counts			1
defense attorney @entity25 , speaking to reporters after the arraignment , said some charges in the indictment " can not be disputed			0
" but the plea -- targeting the murder accusations and the specter of a death penalty -- signals an effort to forge a " resolution " and avoid a trial , he said			1

police say one of the young women he is accused of holding was impregnated five times by @entity13 , and another bore a child fathered by him			1
@entity25 told reporters that the plea " requires the prosecutor to continue to evaluate their case and determine whether medical and forensic evidence can actually support an aggravated murder conviction for the death of a fetus and whether the death penalty is warranted			0
" rescued women ' happy and safe , ' attorneys say the prosecutor released a statement saying a capital review committee will consider whether the case is appropriate for seeking the death penalty once the indictment process is complete			0
@entity25 , @entity13 's attorney , acknowledged that " in all likelihood , the prosecutor 's decision will be predicated upon the opinions of medical and forensic experts , and more importantly , whether the women in this case want this case to go to trial for those limited issues			1
" " we are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women , their families and this community , " the lawyer said			1
" mr. @entity13 currently faces hundreds of years in prison with the current charges , and it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty			1
" life during and after the abductions @entity89 , a @entity7 criminal defense attorney , told @entity0 's @entity90 later wednesday that @entity13 's defense team appeared to be laying out a scenario that ends with their client spending the rest of his life behind bars			1
" do n't bring the death penalty , there will be a plea , let 's do life , " @entity89 said , offering his take on their strategy			0
the charges cover only half of the 10 years the three women allegedly were held captive -- from august 2002 , when the first of the three disappeared off a @entity7 street , to february 2007			0
in addition to the two murder counts , the indictment charges @entity13 with 139 counts of rape , 177 counts of kidnapping , seven counts of gross sexual imposition , three counts of felonious assault and one count of possession of criminal tools , prosecutors said			1
@entity13 's case has attracted national attention because of the unusual length and depravity of the alleged crimes			1
" the horrific brutality and torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension , " @entity132 prosecutor @entity131 has said			0
' please do n't let me go , ' @entity7 kidnap victim told officers the women were freed last month after one of the three shouted for help while @entity13 was away from his 1,400 - square - foot home			1
the women have been identified as @entity13 , abducted at age 21 in august 2002 ; @entity13 , who was kidnapped at age 16 in april 2003 and has a 6 - year - old daughter allegedly fathered by @entity13 ; and @entity13 , who was 14 when she disappeared in 2004			2
