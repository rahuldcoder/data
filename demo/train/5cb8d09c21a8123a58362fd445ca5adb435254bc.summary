a new @entity1 poll finds that about half of @entity3 sympathize with the tea party movement			1
the other half either remain aloof or ( 5 % ) even express hostility			0
that second group of @entity3 has received remarkably little media attention this cycle			2
yet their man -- @entity11 -- has held steady in first or second place for the past three years			2
meanwhile tea party @entity3 have bounced from @entity14 to @entity15 to @entity16 to @entity17 to ( now ) @entity18 , transfixing the media every time they lose faith in one messiah and search for another			1
yet sooner or later , the tea party @entity3 must converge on a single choice			1
when they do , they will present the non-tea party republicans with a troubling menu of possibilities			1
possibility 1 : @entity11 is nominated , @entity11 is elected			2
from the point of view of non-tea party republicans , this is the ideal outcome of the 2012 election			1
yet it is also an outcome that looks worryingly out of reach			0
as we enter the final 12 months of the election countdown , @entity11 still can not rise above 30 % support in his own party			1
worse , while it 's easy to imagine ( say ) @entity18 's voters shifting to @entity17 or vice versa , it is very hard to imagine where @entity11 will find the additional @entity3 votes he needs			1
possibility 2 : @entity11 is nominated , @entity11 loses			1
for non-tea party republicans , this second outcome opens all kinds of ugly , ominous possibilities			1
if candidate @entity11 loses , tea party @entity3 will claim that the @entity3 lost because it failed to nominate a " true conservative			1
" that claim may fly in the face of political math ( how would a more extreme candidate win more votes ? ) , but it will pack a lot of emotional punch			0
intense partisans are always ready to believe that the way to win is to be more intense and more partisan			0
back - to - back losses under @entity63 in 2008 and @entity11 in 2012 will open the way to an ultra-conservative nominee in 2016 -- and a true party debacle			1
possibility 3 : a tea party @entity3 is nominated and loses			1
from the point of view of a non-tea party @entity3 , the third possibility is the most tragic waste			1
a winnable election will be thrown away on an ideological adventure			0
yet within the disaster might lurk a silver lining			0
at least the @entity3 will get the ideological adventure out of its system			2
for three years , @entity3 activists have lived in a fantasy world in which fringe characters like @entity14 and @entity18 somehow " speak for the common sense of the common people			2
" it seems incredible that anybody could believe such a thing			0
it seems crazy that anyone would actually need a presidential election to disabuse them of such notions			0
but as @entity91 said : " experience is a hard teacher , but fools will have no other			0
" possibility 4 : a tea party @entity3 is nominated and wins			1
this possibility has to be reckoned the most unlikely			0
but it can not be excluded as utterly impossible , on two conditions : if the @entity101 economy continues as weak and sick as it is today , and ; if tea party @entity3 revert from the utterly unelectable @entity18 to @entity17 , who as governor of @entity104 possesses at least the paper qualifications for the presidency			1
then - who knows ? - anything might happen			0
@entity17 would be a much weaker candidate than @entity11 , but if the voters are determined to fire the incumbent , then even a weak challenger can prevail			2
( see @entity112 , 2008 candidacy of			0
) in which case , not only tea party @entity3 but all @entity3 and all @entity101 will confront the problem : what next ? the tea party stands for a series of propositions that do n't meet the reality test : that deficits matter more than jobs , that cutting deficits and tightening credit will accelerate economic growth , that high taxes and over-regulation are the most important reasons that growth has not revived , and that @entity101 still offers the world 's best opportunity for the poor to rise			1
tea party plans call for a radical shift in the burden of taxation from the rich to the poor -- and promise big reductions in government spending without touching any of the benefits of current retirees			2
if put into practice , the tea party platform is a formula for political and economic crisis			2
fortunately , it remains a long - shot outcome			0
if you 're betting the odds , you want to put your money on possibility three			0
as for possibility one -- that 's just good government			0
and nobody seems to get much excited about that these days .			0

@entity158 : non-tea party @entity3 hope @entity11 will be the nominee and win election
he says @entity11 seems stuck in the polls and ca n't seem to win @entity118 voters ' support
if @entity11 is nominated and loses , tea party will push party further right
@entity169 : tea party stands for a series of ideas that do n't meet the reality test
