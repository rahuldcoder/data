@entity0 -- @entity2 conceded thursday they do n't have the votes to pass the @entity4 , a bill that would have offered a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants who entered the @entity9 as children			1
@entity2 voted to pull the measure from consideration , a move that jeopardizes the chances for passing the hotly contested bill during the current lame - duck session of @entity17 that ends in early january			1
while supporters say the measure that passed the @entity20 on wednesday could still come up , each passing day reduces the likelihood for introducing and debating the act as legislative leaders battle over priorities in the waning days of the session			0
@entity2 @entity28 opposed the bill , standing by their pledge to block any legislation during the lame - duck session until the chamber approves bills to extend the @entity36 tax cuts and fund the government			1
the so - called @entity38 would have affected immigrants who entered the @entity9 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the country for at least five years			2
other requirements include graduating from high - school or obtaining a general education development diploma and demonstrating " good moral character			0
" even then , only a six - year conditional status would be awarded			0
before moving to the next phase , the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years , and passing criminal background checks			0
proponents , including president @entity55 and @entity57 leaders , say the bill offers legal standing to young people brought to the @entity9 who have bettered themselves and served their new country , while opponents claim it is a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants			1
a @entity20 statement thursday praised @entity2 @entity57 leaders for pulling the bill so that the chamber can take up the version passed by the @entity20			2
noting that eight @entity72 voted with @entity2 to pass the measure , the statement by press secretary @entity71 said the proposal " should get bipartisan support in the @entity2 as well , and in light of the vote in the @entity20 , this is the right way to move forward to get that			1
" rep. @entity79 , @entity80 , a major supporter of the @entity4 , said thursday that " we now have the weekend and into next week to launch a national mobilization to get the votes to enact this important bill			0
" @entity1 's @entity84 and @entity85 contributed to this report .			0
