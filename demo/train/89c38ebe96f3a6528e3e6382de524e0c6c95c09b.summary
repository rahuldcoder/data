a federal judge said monday that he believes the government 's once - secret collection of domestic phone records is unconstitutional , setting up likely appeals and further challenges to the data mining revealed by classified leaker @entity7			1
@entity9 district judge @entity8 said the @entity11 's bulk collection of metadata -- phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content -- apparently violates privacy rights			1
his preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice , but @entity8 limited the decision only to their cases			1
" i can not imagine a more ' indiscriminate ' and ' arbitrary invasion ' than this systematic and high - tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval , " said @entity8 , an appointee of president @entity24			1
" surely , such a program infringes on ' that degree of privacy ' that the @entity36 enshrined in the @entity37			0
" @entity8 's ruling said the " plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a @entity37 claim , " adding " as such , they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury			2
" he rejected the government 's argument that a 1979 @entity49 case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata , noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in the past three decades			0
@entity8 also noted that the government " does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the @entity11 's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack , or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time - sensitive in nature			1
" however , he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information , pending an appeal by the government			2
a @entity67 spokesman said monday that " we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found , " but said the ruling is being studied			0
@entity73 sen. @entity72 of @entity74 , a critic of the @entity11 data mining , said @entity8 's ruling showed that " the bulk collection of @entity9 ' phone records conflicts with @entity9 ' privacy rights under the @entity79 and has failed to make us safer			1
" he called on @entity80 to pass legislation he proposed to " ensure the @entity11 focuses on terrorists and spies - and not innocent @entity9			1
" explosive revelations earlier this year by @entity7 , a former @entity11 contractor , triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the september 2001 terrorist attacks			1
@entity7 's revelations led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance			1
in a statement distributed by journalist @entity96 , who first reported the leaks , @entity7 said he acted on the belief that the mass surveillance program would not withstand a constitutional challenge , and that @entity9 deserved a judicial review			1
" today , a secret program authorized by a secret court was , when exposed to the light of day , found to violate @entity9 ' rights			0
it is the first of many , " according to @entity7 , who is living in @entity108 under a grant of asylum to avoid prosecution over the leaks in the @entity9			1
@entity96 said the judge 's ruling vindicates what @entity7 did			1
" i think it 's not only the right , but the duty of an @entity9 citizen in @entity7 's situation to come forward , at great risk to himself , and inform his fellow citizens about what it is their government is doing in the dark that is illegal , " the journalist told @entity129 's " @entity128 " monday night			2
the @entity11 has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant @entity133 and leading internet companies , including @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			2
the case before @entity8 involved approval for surveillance in april by a judge at the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) , a secret body that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for " foreign intelligence purposes			0
" @entity133 turned over the metadata to the government			0
@entity8 's ruling comes as the @entity153 administration completes a review of @entity11 surveillance in the aftermath of the @entity7 leaks			1
@entity129 's @entity158 reported monday that tech company executives would meet with president @entity153 at the @entity160 on tuesday to discuss the issue			0
@entity153 plans to sit down with @entity163 of @entity136 and @entity164 of @entity137 , as well as executives from @entity166 , @entity135 , @entity139 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity138 , @entity171 , sherpa @entity172 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 , a @entity160 official said			0
some of those companies issued a joint letter last week calling on the government to change its surveillance policies in the wake of the @entity7 revelations			1
last month , the @entity183 refused to take up the issue when it denied a separate petition , which was filed by the @entity186			0
prior lawsuits against the broader @entity11 program also have been unsuccessful			2
days after the @entity7 disclosure in june , some @entity133 customers filed legal challenges in the @entity193 federal court			1
the left - leaning @entity194 also filed a separate , pending suit in @entity197 federal court			2
under the @entity199 of the 1970s , the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping , data analysis , and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the @entity9			0
the @entity207 that @entity80 passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government 's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the @entity9 and abroad , eventually including the metadata collection			0
in order to collect the information , the government has to demonstrate that it 's " relevant " to an international terrorism investigation			0
however , the 1978 @entity199 law lays out exactly what the special court must decide : " a judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the @entity9 , interfere with a criminal , counterterrorism , or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person			0
" in defending the program , @entity11 director gen. @entity236 told the @entity238 last week that " 15 separate judges of the @entity144 have held on 35 occasions that @entity241 ( of the @entity207 ) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations			2
" initially , telecommunications companies such as @entity133 , were the targets of legal action against @entity207 provisions			0
@entity80 later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses			0
the revelations of the @entity11 program and the inner workings of the @entity144 court came after @entity7 leaked documents to the @entity259 newspaper			1
@entity7 fled to @entity260 and then @entity108 to escape @entity9 prosecution			2
the case is @entity263 v. @entity153 ( 13 - cv - 881 ) .			0

@entity7 says he knew the surveillance would not withstand legal review
the limited ruling opens the door to possible further legal challenges
the @entity11 data - mining can *continue* , pending a likely appeal
classified leaks by @entity7 revealed the *extent* of the data - mining
