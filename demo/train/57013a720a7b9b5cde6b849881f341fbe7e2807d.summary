@entity0 -- the naughty step is not working			0
after the @entity4 slapped tougher sanctions on @entity6 after its third nuclear test in february this year , @entity3 screamed in defiance			1
it canceled its hotline with @entity11 , withdrew its workers from the @entity14 industrial complex it jointly operates with @entity16 , and carried on with its over-the - top threats			0
@entity18 may have backed those sanctions but the economic lifeline is still there			1
trade goes on between @entity6 and @entity18			1
in 2011 , before some of these trade embargoes began , @entity18 accounted for an estimated 67.2 % of @entity6 's exports and 61.6 % of imports , according to the @entity26			1
" if you talk to officials at the border , there 's no change , " says @entity27 , the @entity28 head of the @entity29			0
" and a lot of that trade is conducted by government trading companies especially on the @entity6 side , " adds the @entity37 ' @entity36 chief @entity35			2
" there 's a lot more @entity18 could do that it has chosen not to			2
" so why is @entity18 not using its economic leverage to rein in the nuclear threat and proliferator next door ? in a word -- fear			2
there 's fear of a @entity6 collapse that would lead to instability and a refugee crisis along its 1,400 kilometer ( 880 mile ) border with @entity6			1
and then there 's the far greater fear of an all - out conflict that would redraw the geopolitical map			0
" their end goal might be similar in terms of denuclearization , but @entity18 is looking at preventing war on the peninsula , which would allow a @entity66 government right on its border , " says @entity27			0
and there 's something else holding @entity70 back -- the historic and symbolic relationship with @entity3 that is hard to give up			1
" the @entity72 thinks of @entity6 as this small state that is in its own image , " says @entity35			0
" the structure of the @entity6 government is very similar to the @entity18 government and , in a way , it 's the pure communist state			1
" it 's just really hard psychologically to dump @entity6			0
" " they treat @entity6 a bit like a wayward child , " adds @entity27			0
" you want to be the one to punish your child , but you 're not going to turn them over to police			0
" but for many people in @entity18 , enough is enough			0
" their rhetoric is increasing the number of @entity18 who feel very , very disgusted by their behavior , their psyche and their regime , " says @entity90 , professor of @entity91 at @entity92			1
" @entity18 's government is seriously under fire because i think the majority of @entity18 really , really feel that @entity6 's bad behavior will inevitably endanger @entity18			1
" @entity70 has mastered the art of " scream - free parenting " with @entity3			2
it has learned to lower its voice and control its emotional reaction with every new threat or missile test			0
but public opinion is shifting and @entity18 's new leadership is recognizing the need to re-evaluate how it manages its troublesome neighbor			2
in a sign of @entity70 's evolving approach toward @entity6 , @entity18 president @entity114 recently offered this veiled criticism : " no one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains			1
" the pressure is on for @entity18 to spell out -- and carry out -- the consequences for @entity6 's bad behavior .			2
