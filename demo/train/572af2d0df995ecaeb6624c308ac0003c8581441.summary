-- an emotional @entity1 came back from a set down to beat @entity2 4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in the final of the @entity4			1
@entity2 had won the first set 6 - 4 but @entity1 , who has dedicated his victories from previous rounds to the victims of floods that have deluged both @entity10 and his homeland @entity12 , fought back to clinch a memorable victory			1
the @entity4 has been something of a victory procession for @entity2 , the defending champion who has won the title seven times			1
and it looked like he would make that eight after a steady first set put the @entity21 in control			2
@entity1 , however , was having none of it			2
after breaking @entity2 's serve early in the second set djokovic powered on to win the next two sets and his 19th career @entity26 title			1
" he 's one of the best in the world , he 's playing great , " @entity2 said of @entity1 after the defeat			1
" i played well for moments , i had my chances for moments , but i could have done with a little more energy at times			0
my legs did n't answer me after a tough week			0
" " i was able to find positive things during the tournament but i played three very tough matches this week and it was very hard mentally , as well as physically			0
i was a little bit tired			0
" it is the first time in a decade that @entity2 has lost three matches in a season on clay			2
@entity1 had endured something of a torrid time in @entity4 , struggling to defeat the young , big - hitting @entity50 @entity49 in a three hour , three set epic in the semi-finals			1
@entity53 lost the first set , and again he powered back			2
after the match , @entity12 's most famous sportsman described how he had been keeping abreast of events back home , sent a message of support and even criticized western media outlets for not covering the floods adequately			1
" there have not been floods like this in the existence of our people , " he said after that match , as reported by @entity64			0
" it is a total catastrophe of biblical proportions			0
i do n't really know how to describe it			0
half the country is in danger of not having any electricity , there is total immobilization , evacuations -- and we 're talking about whole cities , not small villages			0
" " i see that on @entity0 , the @entity84 and other big networks there is a lot about the miners in @entity88 , and so forth			0
this is another disaster , but there is no broadcast from @entity12 and @entity10 , nothing about the biggest floods that we have ever seen , that maybe @entity95 has ever seen			0
" now attention turns to the @entity98 , which begins next week			1
@entity2 is the reigning champion and has won eight titles in the past nine years .			1
