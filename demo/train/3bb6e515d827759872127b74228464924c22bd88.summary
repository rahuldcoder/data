@entity0 , @entity1 -- a visit to the @entity4 is a test of diet discipline : they fry just about everything -- from @entity9 to butter to mac & cheese -- and the bigger the better , from half - pound tenderloins to massive turkey legs and pork chops			1
not much changes from year to year			0
there 's the butter cow , nightly entertainment at the grandstand , arcade games and amusement rides			0
but the " @entity23 " booth , while hardly a scientific enterprise , offers a big hint of change from the last presidential year : with more than 30,000 kernels cast , @entity27 is leading president @entity29			1
@entity1 , the scene of a 10 - point @entity29 blowout in 2008 , is a 2012 presidential battleground			1
@entity29 stopped by the fair during his three - day @entity1 bus tour this week			1
and the @entity27 campaign chose the fair for the solo debut of rep. @entity37 , the @entity38 vice presidential pick			1
" we have a real battle going on here for the heart and soul of the people of this state , " @entity38 gov. @entity39 says during an early afternoon walk through the fairgrounds			1
" president @entity29 had a tremendous following here four years ago , " @entity39 says in making the @entity38 's case			1
" but people feel betrayed			1
they feel like he ran as someone who was going to bring people together and reach across the aisle and he has n't done that			1
" @entity39 is both a throwback and part of an @entity1 @entity38 revival : he was governor for 16 years , left office , and then decided to run again in 2010 , when the @entity61 was a big part of the midterm @entity38 rout			1
four years ago , @entity65 enjoyed a significant numbers advantage in @entity1			1
now , there is parity -- even a slight @entity38 edge in the latest active voter registration tally			1
" have you been outhustled here ? " is the question we put to top @entity29 political strategist @entity73 as he traveled with the president this week			1
@entity73 was quick to offer a tip of the cap to @entity39 and the @entity78 for their aggressive work the past few years , but he voiced confidence the @entity29 campaign was stepping up its grass - roots organizing			1
" i think we still have an organizational advantage in this state , " @entity73 says			2
" we 've done a good job of registering new voters so i think we are building that back up			0
but i do n't think we are going to be outhustled on @entity89			2
" the urgency is obvious when you stop by a local @entity29 campaign office			2
in @entity100 this week , for example , everyone in line for tickets to one of the president 's rallies was asked if they were registered voters			2
those who said no were immediately handed a clipboard with the registration form , and volunteers -- knowing anyone not registered by now might be unreliable come @entity89 -- suggested they also sign up to vote by mail , which allows the campaign to follow - up and witness the process			2
you do n't need to visit the fair or a campaign office to understand 2012 is different from 2008			2
just turn on the television			0
the tv ad war is bruising , and unavoidable -- $ 6 million spent just in @entity1 in the last month			2
the @entity29 campaign outspent the @entity27 campaign more than 2 - 1 in the past month in @entity1			1
but the tv ad war scales tip back in favor of @entity27 and the @entity38 when spending by the political parties and super pacs is factored in			0
@entity1 is a great test of the @entity124			0
the president 's team says his policy views -- on @entity129 , on a new long - term farm bill and on renewable energy subsidies -- will in the end trump any short - term bounce from his campaign skills and @entity61 roots			1
" he may hail from @entity137 , " @entity73 says in the interview , " but he is very much a product of the right - wing @entity139 think tanks			2
and that vision is not a good vision for this country			0
" @entity39 , in turn , calls the @entity37 pick " brilliant " and , a @entity145 himself , predicts having a @entity145 as the no. 2 on the @entity38 ticket will help with a critical voting bloc here , especially in the @entity151 corner of the state			0
plus , @entity39 says @entity1 voters rank the federal deficit higher than jobs as an election priority -- and says @entity37 is in tune with their worries about annual deficits and long - term debt			2
" you can not increase the deficit , the debt , a trillion dollars every year and have 40 cents of every dollar you spend be borrowed money , " @entity39 says			0
@entity39 also says he is confident of what you might call a reverse - coattails effect : he says republicans are competitive in each of the state 's congressional districts this year , and suggests that will help with the presidential margins in traditionally @entity65 areas like @entity0 and surrounding @entity173			1
democrats take a not - so - fast approach to that dynamic -- promising to make the @entity37 budget , particularly its @entity129 proposals , an issue in every @entity180 race here and beyond			0
@entity39 acknowledged the potential power of the issue , especially in an older state like @entity1 , but predicted it would not hurt the @entity38 provided @entity27 and @entity37 used every opportunity to rebut the attacks and explain their proposals			1
" it 's going to be close , " @entity39 says of the state , making note of the heavy commitment of candidate time , staff and spending both campaigns are making to @entity1			2
that includes busy booths just a few steps away from each other at the fair , where both campaigns are helping to register voters and recruit volunteers			0
@entity39 , whose involvement in presidential politics goes back more than a quarter - century , smiles at all the activity -- and attention			0
" it 's fun , " the governor says , " to be a battleground state			0
" @entity73 , who also traveled with vice president @entity210 the last time he came to @entity1 , says the state and its six electoral votes could prove decisive			1
" @entity213 , my philosophy is always to plan for the worst and hope for the best , " @entity73 says			0
" and so we 're planning for 270 electoral votes ( the minimum for victory )			0
in that scenario , even a smaller state like @entity1 can be a pivotal state			0
and that 's why we 're spending three days here			0
we 're not leaving anything to chance			0
we 're fighting for every vote and every electoral vote			0
and these electoral votes matter			0

president @entity29 won @entity1 in a 10 - point blowout in 2008 ; this year it could go either way
@entity65 enjoyed a numbers advantage in 2008 , this year there is parity
@entity1 's @entity38 governor says people feel betrayed by @entity29
@entity29 strategist @entity73 says the campaign wo n't be " outhustled " in @entity1
