-- on wednesday some @entity2 wireless carriers implemented the first part of a national strategy to deter cell phone theft : a joint " blacklist " database of identifying information about cell phones reported lost or stolen			1
as of now , cell phone dealers are supposed check this database before honoring requests to reactivate allegedly " locked - out " phones , in order to prevent people from using stolen phones			1
it used to be that when you reported a phone lost or stolen , your carrier would suspend service to that device			2
but the person who stole your phone ( or someone who bought it from the thief ) could still walk into a cell phone dealer and get your phone reactivated under a new account			2
@entity32 , vice president of regulatory affairs for @entity33 ( a global association of wireless carriers ) , explained : " the point of the blacklist database is to dry up the aftermarket for stolen phones			1
if you ca n't reactivate a stolen phone , it 's just a worthless hunk of plastic and metal			1
" the @entity44 first announced this @entity46 initiative in april to combat the theft of smartphones , tablets and the data they contain			0
under this plan , @entity2 carriers that use gsm network technology ( that 's @entity53 and @entity54 ) committed to launching their databases by october 31			2
the other @entity2 carriers , which operate cdma - technology networks , still have over a year to get their lost / stolen phone databases up and running ( by november 30 , 2013 )			1
according to @entity33 , @entity61 has already implemented its database			0
at first these @entity64 databases will be carrier - specific ; later the blacklists from all carriers will be integrated into a single database			0
carriers which have launched their blacklist databases are now working to educate phone dealers on how to access them			0
it 's likely that phone dealerships operated by carriers will follow this process -- but educating and gaining cooperation from independently operated phone retailers will be more challenging			0
wireless carriers join forces to fight theft " this will take time , " @entity32 acknowledged			1
" i tend to see this as a glass half full			0
we 're definitely making progress on fighting this problem , but it 's not solved yet			0
" in the meantime , carriers are stepping up their efforts to get cell phone users to protect their devices			1
public service announcements and other education efforts are under way to remind people to keep their cell phones and tablets locked with a password or pin code			2
these carrier efforts include web pages about phone security , mobile apps , e-mail information , bill inserts , and more			0
some carriers such as @entity53 and device manufacturers such as @entity108 offer a free " remote wipe " service -- allowing users to delete all data from a lost or stolen device to prevent data or identity theft			2
other carriers charge for this service , and most mobile security vendors , such as @entity118 or @entity119 , offer remote wipe as part of an annual subscription service package			0
it is possible to forcibly unlock a phone that is locked with a password or pin , but this is considerably more difficult for thieves and could act as a deterrent			0
one factor slowing the implementation of a centralized cross-carrier database of lost or stolen phones is the uneven pace of @entity135 network rollouts across the @entity2 some of the identifying information listed in the database is derived from wireless networks , and variations in network technology make it difficult to create consistent and reliable listings for individual devices			1
so , while the carriers work to dry up the stolen phone aftermarket , take a moment to set up remote wipe service for your phone , remember to keep it locked , and beware of low - cost used phones available for sale on @entity155 , @entity156 , and elsewhere			1
if you purchase a device that turns out to be stolen and therefore ca n't activate it , you wo n't get your money back			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity163 .			0
