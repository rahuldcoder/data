-- in an unprecedented action , the @entity1 is restoring scholarships to the @entity5 football team that were originally lost last year when the school was sanctioned for its handling of the @entity9 child sex abuse scandal			1
@entity9 , 69 , a former defensive coordinator , was convicted last year of sexually abusing 10 boys he met through his charity			2
he is serving a 30 - to 60 - year prison term			2
but the sanctions against @entity5 mostly revolved around an alleged cover - up by the university 's former president , vice president and athletic director			1
all three men are facing trial in the spring on charges they lied to authorities and never reported an incident of sexual abuse witnessed in 2001 in the @entity5 locker room facilities			2
the gradual restoration of scholarships was recommended to the @entity1 board by former sen. @entity29 , the athletics integrity monitor for the university , for the school 's " groundbreaking work " and " strong commitment to restore integrity " in the last year			1
@entity29 said tuesday that the school has consistently cooperated with the @entity1 since the sanctions were imposed			0
@entity29 said more than 120 reforms have been implemented , and @entity5 has become a model for reform at other schools			0
other sanctions levied last year , including a post-season ban , a $ 60 million fine and 13 years of vacated wins of legendary coach @entity46 , remain in place			1
@entity29 said he recommended a post-season ban stay in place , for now , to give the university a continued incentive to work toward reform			1
the @entity1 has never before rescinded sanctions imposed against a university			0
the restoration will mean that @entity5 's football team , under coach @entity56 , will get five more scholarships next year , and 10 more each of the following three seasons			1
by the start of the 2016 season , @entity5 will again have the full amount of scholarships			2
@entity5 president @entity65 said the change represents " significant efforts over the past year to make @entity5 a safer , stronger institution			0
" @entity1 president @entity69 , who has been widely criticized for relying on the university 's independent report instead of launching his own @entity1 investigation at @entity5 , said the board was " pleased " to make this decision			0
in making his recommendation to the @entity1 board , @entity29 said he considered the sanctions that most affect student athletes			0
he also noted a great divide among the @entity5 community over how the @entity9 scandal has been handled			1
the university recently settled lawsuits with several men who said @entity9 abused them			0
the role of @entity46 , who died in january 2012 , in the cover - up has been widely debated			1
in an internal investigation done for the university , @entity88 director @entity87 concluded that @entity46 played a role , but former state prosecutors handling the case said they found no evidence of that .			0
