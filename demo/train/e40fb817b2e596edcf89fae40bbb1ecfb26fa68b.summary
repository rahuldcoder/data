-- it takes a truly adventurous actress to pull off a razored @entity3 , a platinum pixie and a @entity6 bob , but we 'd expect nothing less from the ever provocative @entity9 , who experimented with all three looks in under a year			1
@entity9 says she works with hairstylists and makeup artists who " have a vision			1
" " i have no fears when it comes to my hair or clothes , " proclaims the 36 - year - old star of @entity16 's upcoming mom - and - daughter sitcom " @entity17 " and july 's action flick " @entity19 : the @entity19			1
" makeup , however , is an entirely different matter for the self - declared " poor applier , " who sticks with basics like nude lipstick and pink blush , and ducks whenever she sees a liquid liner			2
" i avoid anything difficult , " she says			2
@entity35 's signature look : " a rosy cheek , a smudgy eye , a lot of mascara -- i look like a doll that has too much makeup on , and i love it ! " have you always been a beauty chameleon ? in high school i would mess with my hair and makeup all the time			1
i used to wear a shirt that said " ms. @entity51 " because i changed my hair color so much			0
i was blond for a long time , then what my mom called " barnyard red			0
" do you still dye it yourself ? only when i have to cover up stray grays			0
and i 'll just use whatever color i find in the grocery store that looks good on the box , like preference by @entity61 -- because i 'm worth it [ laughs ]			0
but for my platinum hair , i went to @entity65 at @entity66 in @entity67 she was a saint			0
i had just dyed my hair dark brown , so she had to very slowly strip out all the color so that my hair would n't burn off			1
and the cut -- are you keeping it short ? i tend to like my hair whatever way it 's not , so now i miss it being long			1
i think i 'm more approachable with long hair			0
when it 's short , i come across as being artsy and weird			1
what 's your typical makeup look ? i used to wear a lot of red lipstick , and when i got a pimple , i 'd cover it up with eyeliner to turn it into a beauty mark			1
but everything has changed since i hit 35			0
i 'm at an age where any makeup that 's meant to look " slept in " really looks like i slept in it			1
that 's for youngsters ! now less is more			2
i do n't like to wear concealer or anything			2
i 'd rather have uneven skin than feel like my face is cracking from too much foundation			0
then you must be serious about your skin care			0
i go to a spa in @entity67 called @entity100 for its @entity101			0
you go once a week for 12 sessions and they 'll look at your skin and tell you how to get it in better condition			0
they really helped me a lot			0
i also stay out of the sun. any thoughts on @entity111 or plastic surgery ? i wanted to get @entity111 once to make me feel younger			1
but i do n't really have [ enough wrinkles ] to justify it yet			1
as for going under the knife , i ca n't say i would n't , but i have n't thought too much about it			2
best beauty product ? @entity120 @entity119 cream is my saving grace for everything			0
it works for my friend 's baby 's bottom , and i can also use it instead of @entity128			2
so what 's next ? i 'm really excited about having a perma - tan and wearing long highlighted hair extensions for my role on " @entity17			1
" and i 've been gaining weight for the part by eating a little bit more of what i want and not moving around as much			0
i 've already put on 15 pounds , and i 'll probably gain another 10			1
it 'll be a whole new me ! will this be your most drastic transformation ? actually i wore huge prosthetic boobs for a @entity143 movie			1
they were glued on every day by a really handsome guy , but ripping them off every night was definitely outside my realm of comfort			0
after those bosoms , i did n't mind being flat - chested anymore ! get a free trial issue of @entity151 ! copyright © 2008 @entity153 all rights reserved .			2
