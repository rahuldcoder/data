no words of remorse ever left his lips , though some expected him to say he was sorry for the blood that was spilled			0
or perhaps , that he made a mistake			0
for journalist @entity164 , @entity7 's trial is not about revenge			1
it 's about justice in a land where the courts and legal system have been rife with corruption			0
