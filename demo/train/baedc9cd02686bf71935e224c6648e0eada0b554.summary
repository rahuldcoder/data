-- the @entity1 are in the home stretch this week , but for the network airing them the games have just begun			2
as @entity6 celebrates ratings success with the @entity8 -- and weathers the shouts of # @entity10 from the critical -- it 's also staring down the onset of fall tv season , that @entity14 flood of returning prime - time staples and new programming			1
in an attempt to rise above the swell and pick up as many viewers as possible , @entity6 's getting a jump - start on the competition and offering advance screenings of two new comedies following its @entity25 coverage as well as two - week " sampling " windows on a variety of platforms for all its fall pilots ahead of their premieres			1
" we are so committed to looking at this as a sampling opportunity that we 're running it without commercials , " said @entity32 , @entity6 's executive vice president of current programming			1
" we 're not focused on ratings ; we 're focused on getting eyeballs			2
" the idea -- to secure viewership before a show premieres -- is n't a new strategy , and @entity6 's not the only network employing it			1
@entity46 , for example , has used pre-premiere sampling in the past to promote " @entity49 " and " @entity50 , " and the network 's doing the same again at the end of this month by offering a two - week window to watch pilots for " the @entity54 " and " @entity55 " online ahead of their september premieres			1
but at the moment , @entity46 does n't have the viewership that @entity6 has -- on monday night , 26.6 million were tuned in to @entity6 during prime time -- nor does it have a reputation of poorly received fall seasons past to shake off			1
@entity6 's chairman of entertainment , @entity65 , reportedly told press at the recent @entity68 tour the brand 's in a period of transition after being in last place since the ' 03 - ' 04 season , and is trying to stretch toward content with broader appeal			1
to that end , no one 's batting an eyelash that @entity6 is trying to capitalize on this sizable audience , but whether the efforts will pay off is up for debate			1
one potential kink is a question of timing , and whether tv - deluged audiences , more accustomed to on - demand versus appointment viewing , will remember to tune in a month			1
the answer to that , of course , will be compounded by the other question at hand , that of quality			2
it 's no secret that in its post- " friends " and " er " years , @entity6 acquired a rep for dismal programming , and was unable to find anything that stuck , said @entity100 , a tv critic and former president of the @entity68			1
" after a while , it 's difficult to get momentum again , " @entity102 said			2
" they 've tried to do quality shows			2
' parenthood ' is a quality show , ' @entity111 ' was a high - quality show , but they somehow just lost traction with viewers , and they have to do something to try to get people back into the tent			2
" wednesday night will bring a look at @entity120 's " @entity119 , " a darker comedy about a radio sportscaster who joins a group therapy session after his wife dies			2
after the @entity128 ' closing ceremony sunday , there 'll be a viewing of " @entity130 " in which @entity131 plays a womanizing veterinarian who 's not that into people but does have a monkey sidekick			2
" @entity6 has not done well in a crowded landscape , " @entity102 said , so this year 's strategy " gives an opportunity to let their shows shine			1
having said that , they do n't have very many shiny shows			0
" " @entity130 , " in the estimation of free - lance tv critic @entity146 , " is the lowest common denominator at the time when they have the most people			2
" @entity120 's " @entity119 , " while not a favorite , was more fully formed			2
" for all of @entity6 's desires to sort of tack toward the middle , it 's a very dark show , " @entity148 said			1
" i have no problem with drama in comedy			0
... there 's a lot of space in the half - hour medium to do different things			0
but people think 30 minutes and they think , if i did n't laugh the whole time this was n't a successful episode of television			0
i do n't know how ( ' @entity119 ' ) will play after the shot put			0
" regardless , " they 'd be foolish not to try , " said @entity168 of @entity169 , although he hastened to add , " i just do n't think it 's going to have that much of an effect			0
" the ' 08 olympics , he noted , did n't offer a promotional boost for that year 's fall lineup			1
" all of @entity6 's new fall 2008 shows -- ' @entity177 , ' ' @entity178 , ' ' @entity180 , ' ' @entity179 , ' ' @entity181 ' -- were canceled in their rookie seasons , " @entity168 added via e-mail			1
" none of them even received a full first - season order			0
" the concept for this year 's strategy has been evolving since 2011 , with @entity6 aware that the @entity25 will bring viewers who are fans of the sporting event but who may not regularly watch the network			1
" we 're doing everything we can to get things out there			0
it 's been a shift in thinking since @entity65 came aboard , " @entity6 exec @entity32 said			1
" these days you have to do it all			0
... when you 're competing with four other networks and there 's 15 new shows all premiering within one week , it becomes very difficult to get attention and , in some cases , convince people to check out your show , whether it 's a new show or a show that they 're loyal to			2
we 're really hoping that by doing this not as a traditional launch , but just as a chance to get people to sample the shows , that we 're getting to have a leg up on our competitors , perhaps , and to have a leg up on a more traditional launch			0
" the concept also applies to its prime - time fantasy show " @entity221 , " which will launch its second season well ahead of the pack on august 13			0
industry observers will likely watch how this plan pays off , as it 's yet another sign of networks being confronted with a vastly changing landscape			1
" there 's really no need for a fall season anymore , " said tv critic and @entity229 contributor @entity227 of @entity230			1
" that started so car companies could roll out their new car advertisements , and that 's not happening			0
the @entity238 model of shows that have like , 10 episodes a season , seems to be much smarter in terms of getting good talent and good scripts , but it 's not a model that has worked economically for the @entity245 yet			0
" networks and newspapers , he added , are having " the same problems right now			0
they 're desperate for the viewers and readers that they do n't have			0
they do n't know how to get them , but in trying to attract them , they 're alienating the people that they do have			0
i think they were trying for young , hip viewers with shows like " @entity263 , " which certainly increased their web presence and their presence in social media , but it did n't pay off in ways that counted , or at least still count for the networks			0
" critic @entity148 agrees , noting that @entity6 's evolution could create problems as it raises awareness of the programming -- that being a lack of clarity of what makes an @entity6 show			1
" right now it 's ' @entity280 , ' ' @entity281 ' and ' @entity263 , ' " but if you ask the broader contingent what 's on @entity6 , " they 're going to say ' @entity286 : @entity289 ' and ' @entity290 , ' " which is problematic considering how well the other networks have shaped their content			1
" @entity291 is a very well - defined identity , with basically the same show on every night , and people love that type of show			0
@entity297 is a well - defined identity , where it 's family comedy with a slight edge plus reality programming for women , " @entity148 said			0
" @entity46 has its reality shows and slightly edgy comedies			0
@entity6 has been struggling for something -- it 's got ' parenthood ' over here , it 's got ' @entity263 ' over here , it 's got ' @entity290 ' in the middle , it 's got ' svu ' hanging on for dear life			1
it 's trying to figure out -- when you think of @entity6 , what are you going to think of ? right now , they want you to think of @entity120 and a monkey			1
" for @entity32 , the answer to the question about the network 's brand is to create " great shows " -- and , yes , great ones that people watch			0
in his estimation , the network 's aiming for greater accessibility , which is n't to discount its more sophisticated programming			0
the thursday night comedies most readily associated with @entity6 -- " @entity281 , " " @entity330 , " " @entity280 , " " @entity263 " -- " they 've brought us attention and acclaim , and we 're incredibly proud of them , " @entity32 said			1
" as for these ( new ) shows , we 're hoping that they 're going to be just as smart , just as funny and insightful , and we 're hoping that they 're going to be instantly accessible to the audience , " he continued			0
" the big shift that i 've felt in the development and the attention in these new shows is just making sure we 're adding an extra dollop of heart			0

@entity6 will use the @entity25 as an entree to two new comedies in coming week
it 's part of a larger strategy to capitalize on ratings and *highlight* content ahead of fall premieres
critics say timing and quality could derail the strategy 's effectiveness
the move is also a sign of the changing tv landscape
