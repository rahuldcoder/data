-- @entity1 came under fire monday for claiming close to 1,000 acres of land in the @entity5 @entity4			1
@entity1 announced sunday that the land in and around the @entity8 valley , would become " state land , " clearing the way for the development of a new @entity1 settlement			1
the affected land lies near @entity14 and close to @entity15 -- one of the biggest @entity1 settlements in the @entity4			1
farmers in the area have 45 days to appeal @entity1 's decision to claim the land			1
" the seizure of such a large swathe of land risks paving the way for further settlement activity , which -- as the @entity23 has reiterated on many occasions -- is illegal under international law and runs totally counter to the pursuit of a two - state solution , " @entity23 secretary - general ban ki - moon said in a statement monday			2
@entity35 foreign secretary @entity34 issued a similar statement , criticizing the move			2
" this is a particularly ill - judged decision that comes at a time when the priority must be to build on the cease - fire in @entity43			0
it will do serious damage to @entity1 's standing in the international community , " he said			2
" our position on settlements is clear : they are illegal under international law , present an obstacle to peace and take us further away from a two state solution at a time when negotiations to achieve this objective urgently need to be resumed			0
" @entity34 said efforts should be focused on securing a durable cease - fire in @entity43 and lasting peace			0
" we strongly urge the government of @entity1 to reverse this decision , " he said			2
teens ' abduction @entity1 officials told @entity0 the expropriation was linked to the kidnapping and murder of three @entity1 teenagers who disappeared from the @entity4 settlement of @entity73 in june			1
tensions between @entity1 and @entity75 ratcheted up after the teens ' bodies were found june 30			2
both sides last week agreed to an open - ended cease - fire following more than seven weeks of heavy fighting			0
@entity75 has said the teens were abducted by @entity75 militants who did not inform the group 's leadership about their operation			0
the @entity86 , which rules over @entity5 in @entity1 - controlled areas of the @entity4 , has posted " no trespassing " signs in the valley			1
farmer @entity91 , 66 , told @entity0 he had grown vegetables and olives in @entity8 for 42 years and did not see why he should suffer the consequences of others ' crimes			1
" we are the neighbors of the @entity1 people , " @entity91 said			0
" we share water and air and everything			0
we have to find a way to live together			0
" the @entity103 said the expropriation was the " the largest @entity1 land grab in the @entity106 of @entity107 in three decades			1
" " this move is further proof of @entity1 's relentless policy of destroying the prospects for a negotiated peace and an independent @entity5 state , living @entity115 in peace and security , " the @entity103 said in a statement			1
the @entity1 group @entity118 expressed bafflement at the move			0
" it 's a crazy idea			0
in my view it 's collective punishment not only to @entity5 but also to @entity1 that it 's actually killing our chances to get to peace some day , and a two state solution , " spokeswoman @entity122 said .			1

@entity103 says " land grab " destroys prospect for peace
@entity35 has urged @entity1 to reverse moves to claim land in the @entity5 @entity4
