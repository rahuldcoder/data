-- are these the worst working hours in world sport ? twenty days at a time working four hours on and four hours off , crammed onto a boat with seven crewmates , some freeze - dried food and one change of clothes each			1
repeat for nine months , until you have crossed the globe			0
" my family did n't want me to join this team , " admits @entity10 , who goes by the @entity12 name @entity13 on the boat			2
his teammate , @entity17 , confides : " actually , i have n't told my family yet			0
they do n't know i 'm going to do offshore sailing			2
" @entity13 and @entity17 are fighting to join an experimental boat for one of sport 's toughest events : the @entity24			1
when the race begins , in october , the @entity25 will be @entity28 's first meaningful attempt at offshore sailing			1
the route will take the crew from @entity32 around @entity33 to the southern coast of @entity35 , on to @entity36 , beneath @entity37 to @entity38 , then back across the @entity39 to @entity40			0
there are only seven places available on the boat , manned by @entity45 skipper @entity44 , and @entity28 hopefuls have endured months of testing and training			1
hundreds initially applied â € ” most had some sailing knowledge but none had the experience expected of an ocean race competitor			1
even so , 20 applicants were selected			2
twelve reached the second phase and now a handful remain			0
selectors kept the top applicants awake for 40 hours at a time , giving them task after task , replicating the demands they may face as a small crew , alone in a storm			1
some left after that experience			0
some walked away once the real sailing began			2
novelty segments " we did a big , real test offshore and one of our best guys decided to stop			0
he said it 's too hard , too long , " recalls @entity44			0
the 40 - year - old was part of the team which won the last @entity24 and is now making his debut as skipper			1
he faces a race against time to prepare crew members from a country where sailing is barely known			1
in @entity28 , the big sports include football , basketball , table tennis and badminton			1
a fishing nation ? yes			0
sailing as a sport ? no. @entity28 companies have sponsored boats in the past and , recently , individual @entity28 sailors have won an @entity99 title and crossed the globe , yet the sport remains in its infancy			1
" they had a few novelty segments on @entity28 tv , where they would stick a reporter on a boat for a day			1
and @entity28 has one @entity99 sailing champion in @entity111 , " explains @entity107 , founder of the @entity109 blog			1
" but no - one would recognize her on the street			2
very , very few people would know her name			0
" @entity44 's @entity28 recruits hope to make their names in one of the world 's most treacherous sporting endeavors			1
the team manager , @entity121 , has personal experience of the worst the race can offer			1
@entity121 , 54 , skippered a boat in the 1989 - 90 ocean race			1
in just one leg of that race , rival boats had seven crew members swept overboard : one died			2
as racing progressed , some boats hit whales and others capsized			0
earlier in june , as the @entity25 crew crossed the @entity39 for the first time , they themselves almost struck a whale			0
" so close , we could hear it breathing , " reported @entity44 from the boat			0
" i have that in my mind all the time , " says @entity121 , " knowing we are bringing the @entity28 along			1
" i know it 's going to be hard and i do n't want to finish the race with something dramatic like what happened in 1989			2
" communication problems though the @entity28 hopefuls all have some sailing experience , they are offshore novices and will be paired with experienced team - mates , mostly @entity45 , for the race itself			1
safety is paramount , but tricky : language is proving a barrier			1
all of the crew , @entity45 and @entity28 , must speak @entity12 as their common tongue , and one or two are struggling			1
" communication is a big problem , " admits @entity44			0
" two of the @entity28 sailors do n't speak @entity12			1
they are having @entity12 lessons , every day we try to improve their @entity12			0
" @entity121 adds : " we have decided that when all the @entity28 are together , if there is one @entity170 person at the table , they have to change to @entity12			1
same with the @entity45 , which is really hard for them , too			1
" each time you fail , you have to put 50 cents in a box			0
we 'll use the money for a big party			0
" @entity44 warns : " everything is in @entity12 -- the rules , everything			0
if they want to play the game , they have to speak @entity12			0
for @entity186 racing it will be a problem of safety if we do n't manage to solve this			2
" so why do it ? why take a group featuring inexperienced sailors , some of whom have trouble communicating , on such a daunting feat of endurance ? " @entity25 , @entity201 , " reads the slogan of the boat 's backer , a commercial vehicle manufacturer			2
for them , the chance to send a @entity28 crew to the @entity24 is a matter of global prestige			1
" @entity207 and @entity208 are blocked in @entity28 , yet they are on the team 's website , " notes @entity107			1
" it 's definitely very western			0
" a lot of @entity28 companies , from a business perspective , are trying to go global			2
" look at @entity215 [ the @entity28 telecoms company ]			2
they have sponsored a ton of different football teams across @entity219 , to make them look impressive in the eyes of the @entity28 public because they were involved in international sport			2
" more challenges for the sailors , both @entity45 and @entity28 , the motivation is a rare chance to bring their sport to a new frontier			1
" i feel more than just a responsibility , " says @entity121			0
" it wakes me up sometimes at night , and i know @entity44 is the same			0
because we have , in 10 months , tried to do what people have done in 10 years and it 's not easy			0
" if we can show the public that 40 % or 50 % of our team is from @entity28 , the next time it will probably be 80 %			1
they will learn more and more			0
the challenge for us is to bring some legacy in @entity28 for offshore sailing			1
" @entity13 says , through a @entity28 interpreter : " the sport of sailing has just started in @entity28			1
as @entity28 , what we need to do is to take more challenges , and to participate in more this kind of race			1
" i think there will be lots of @entity28 sailing teams joining international sailing in the future , so we must find the best way to do it at the beginning			1
" @entity13 will find out if he has made the team on june 26 , while the race begins in @entity261 on october 4			1
" my big fear is not being good			0
not being competitive , " admits @entity44 , who won aboard the @entity264 boat in 2012			0
" i hope we win some legs at least			2
for sure , it 's more complicated because we have the @entity28 aspect and we have to teach them			2
" but i think , if we want to win , the story will not finish at the end of this race			0
@entity186 want to do the next three @entity271 and have more @entity28 on board , maybe a @entity28 skipper in three years ' time			2
we have to continue the job			0
" kit says : " it 's not scary			0
we really want to take the challenge			0
" we know it 's tough , we know it 's dangerous , we know we 'll have to take risks			0
but that 's the game			0
" learn : why size really matters in the yachting world inspire : ca n't afford a house ? try this			0
