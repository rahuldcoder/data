@entity0 -- federal prosecutors tuesday urged a @entity4 judge to sentence actor @entity5 to three years in prison and fine him $ 5 million to demonstrate to taxpayers that refusal to pay income taxes carries severe penalties			1
@entity5 was acquitted of the most serious charges against him			1
@entity5 is scheduled to be sentenced april 24 by @entity14 district judge @entity13 in @entity15 , @entity4 , on three counts of failure to file federal income tax returns			1
one week after vowing to crack down on " tax defiers , " the @entity19 filed court papers seeking the maximum penalty for the three misdemeanor counts on which @entity5 was convicted			2
" this case presents the court with a singular opportunity to deter tax fraud nationwide , " the government said in its sentencing recommendation			1
@entity5 had been charged with felony conspiracy counts for participating in a scheme that rejects the legal foundation of the tax system			1
however , a jury accepted his argument that he was innocently duped by errant tax advisers , and acquitted him on the most serious charges			2
" the fact that @entity5 was acquitted on two felony charges and convicted ' only ' on three misdemeanor counts has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a ' victory ' for @entity5 , " the government document says			2
" the troubling implication of such coverage for the millions of average citizens who are aware of this case is that the rich and famous @entity5 has ' gotten away with it			0
' in the end the criminal conduct of @entity5 must not be seen in such a light			0
" assistant attorney general @entity53 , head of the @entity19 's @entity54 , last week promised to beef up the government 's efforts to pursue those engaged in a variety of schemes making legal assertions that income taxes are either voluntary or unconstitutional			0
" for nearly a decade @entity5 has engaged in a campaign of criminal tax conduct combining brazen defiance with insidious concealment , " the prosecutors say			2
" by these means @entity5 has escaped paying more than $ 15 million in income tax to the @entity67 and has pursued an intended fraudulent harm to the @entity69 of more than $ 41 million			1
" the document says @entity5 shipped millions of dollars to accounts in @entity72 , @entity73 and the @entity74 to avoid taxes			0
" given defendant 's income , earning capacity , and financial resources , both disclosed and undisclosed , the @entity14 submits that a fine of at least $ 5 million is warranted , " the sentencing recommendation says			1
the 35 - page argument for the stiffest possible penalty ends with a dramatic flair			0
" in the defendant @entity5 , the court is presented with a wealthy , famous and inveterate tax scofflaw			0
if ever a tax offender was deserving of being held accountable to the maximum extent for his criminal wrongdoing , @entity5 is that defendant , " it says			0
the @entity67 is also seeking repayment of all taxes and interest through civil court proceedings			0
