@entity0 -- the chairmen of the @entity7 and @entity8 committees have reached a tentative agreement on a bill to reform the @entity12 health system , aides to each of the men said sunday , just days before @entity13 is scheduled to leave on its august recess			1
the deal , which still needs to be approved by both chambers , is expected to address both short - and long - term needs at the department , which was rocked by a waiting list scandal earlier this year			1
sen. @entity25 , i - @entity21 , and rep @entity22 , @entity24 , scheduled a monday news conference to outline their agreement			0
a news release for that event said " @entity22 and @entity25 continued negotiations this weekend and made significant progress on legislation to make the @entity12 more accountable and recruit more doctors , nurses and other health care professionals			1
" a separate @entity37 source confirmed a deal â € ” but also declined to give the dollar amount			0
the @entity12 , a massive bureaucracy with more than 300,000 full - time employees , is under fire as it deals with allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities			2
the controversy , as @entity1 first reported , involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases			0
@entity49 stepped down as head of the department in may after @entity52 , @entity53 and veterans ' advocacy groups joined in calling for his resignation			0
@entity57 , a @entity58 graduate and former ceo of @entity60 , was tapped to become the troubled department 's new head			1
at the @entity8 medical center in @entity66 , for example , a preliminary report made public in may indicated at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment and were never placed on a wait list			1
@entity1 has reported that in @entity66 , the @entity12 used fraudulent record - keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans , some of whom died in the process			1
but the problems go well beyond @entity66			0
dozens of others of @entity12 centers , all around the country , also face a host of allegations like possible abuse of scheduling practices			2
" it is clear that there are significant and chronic systemic failures that must be addressed by the leadership at @entity12 , " said a report last month prepared by @entity88 , president @entity89 's deputy chief of staff			2
veterans waiting longer for cancer care @entity1 's @entity96 and @entity97 contributed to this report .			0
