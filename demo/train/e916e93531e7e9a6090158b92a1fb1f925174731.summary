-- hosts @entity1 claimed top spot in @entity3 at the troubled @entity4 with 4 - 2 win over @entity6 in @entity7 saturday			1
the match may have lacked the quality of previous classic encounters between the world football heavyweights , but burst into life in the second half			0
@entity14 had given @entity1 the lead before the break , but it needed a double from @entity18 and a classic free kick from home talisman @entity20 to see off a determined @entity23 challenge			1
@entity24 also meant @entity1 will likely avoid world champions @entity26 in next week 's semifinals			0
@entity26 currently top @entity28 ahead of the final round of matches sunday and have been in commanding form , beating minnows @entity32 10 - 0 in their latest match			2
@entity1 have also impressed with comfortable wins over @entity35 and @entity36 , but this has gone almost unnoticed because of the mass popular protests outside games and across the country			1
demonstrators have taken to the streets to highlight the cost of @entity1 hosting next year 's @entity44 and the @entity45 against a background of sub standard public services and corruption			0
the other match saturday in @entity3 in the southeastern city of @entity51 , between @entity36 and @entity35 , saw a massive rally in the streets near the @entity54			1
police fired tear gas to attempt to disperse protesters , who had gathered despite a televised appearance late friday by president @entity59 , who had promised changes			0
@entity35 beat @entity36 2 - 1 after two goals by @entity63 's @entity62			1
before the match in @entity7 at the @entity66 , @entity6 coach @entity64 had advised his squad to stay inside their hotel because of security fears , but only limited protests were reported there			1
@entity20 proved a thorn in @entity6 's side from the start and was behind a flurry of attacks in the first minute			2
but the rest of the half proved scrappy until the home breakthrough in added time			0
@entity20 whipped in a free kick and after @entity18 's header was palmed clear by @entity23 goalkeeper @entity82 , @entity14 pounced to slot home the rebound			2
@entity6 surprisingly equalized in the 51st minute as @entity85 cleverly flicked on a long ball with a backheel and @entity88 charged forward to score			0
but parity lasted just four minutes , @entity20 winning a free kick on the edge of the area and stepping up to beat @entity82 with a precise strike			0
it was the @entity96 - bound star 's 23rd goal for @entity1 and sixth in his last seven games , continuing his superb form at the @entity4			1
@entity85 had a penalty appeal denied before @entity18 showed his strength to thump home the third in the 66th minute			0
shortly afterwards , @entity20 , who has scored three goals in the competition , was substituted by coach @entity105 , rested ahead of a last four clash in @entity51 next wednesday			1
but it looked an unwise move as @entity6 pulled one back as @entity109 scored with a low shot after @entity1 failed to clear a corner			2
@entity112 thumped the woodwork as @entity6 pushed for an equalizer but were finally defeated when @entity18 converted after @entity82 could only push out @entity116 's shot into his path			2
" we beat a strong @entity23 team and i think this shows we are on the right road , even if there are a few things we need to improve , " @entity105 told @entity118 .			0
