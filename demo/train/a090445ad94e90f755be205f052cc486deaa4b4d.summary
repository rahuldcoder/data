-- monsters of the deep will have a man - made horror to contend with , as the @entity5 is released into the oceans			1
weighing over half a ton , the six - legged , crustacean - inspired robot is intended for the most dangerous undersea exploration			1
developed by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , the @entity5 offers a solution to a longstanding problem			1
while propeller - driven craft do not work well in fierce tides , and divers are limited to calm , relatively shallow seas , the new machine mimics the design of crabs and lobsters that live in stormy waters but are still able to control their movements			2
the @entity24 is 2.4m long , 2.4m wide and 1.3m tall -- rising to 1.8m when it stands up			2
including payload it weighs around 650 kg , and its six legs contain 30 motors , giving the remote pilot ample control and dexterity			2
as the @entity24 creeps along the ocean floor , it can adapt its posture to different current or pressure conditions , to a depth of around 200 meters			2
using sonar , it scans the landscape for objects of interest , and can relay images through onboard cameras			2
@entity24 is undergoing final tests in " aggressive waters " ahead of its first mission			0
in may , it will be hunting for ancient artifacts in the @entity51 , where existing crafts have failed			0
read this : the guns that know who 's firing them lead researcher @entity57 told @entity0 the machine had performed " very well " in tests , but was undergoing constant modification			0
" we are performing tests nearly every day , " @entity57 told @entity0			0
" we upgrade @entity24 software for more stable and fast walking and manipulation			0
" the researcher says the robot 's speed of just 10 cm / second is one of the main challenges his team face , along with enhancing the vehicle 's stability in strong currents and on rough terrain			1
the underwater vision system is another priority			1
but should crabster succeed in its maiden voyage , @entity57 predicts a widespread impact			0
" we suppose @entity5 can conduct seabed mapping , survey and inspection of wrecks , pipelines , ecosystems and pollution down to a 200 - meter depth			1
@entity5 will help divers or work instead of them in harsh environments			1
it also could assist in locating underwater resources , carrying out underwater mining , and responding to oil spill incidents			1
" @entity57 hopes his creation will be manufactured for use across the world , and is already looking ahead to future incarnations inspired by nature			0
" we are now studying to make the @entity24 to swim like turtles or diving beetles			0
and we are also considering the hydraulic @entity24 for heavy - duty underwater working			1
" and are the researchers expecting their machine to be accepted in the marine environment ? " i do n't know if the animals treat the @entity5 as a real crab or not , " says @entity112 " i thought fish like it more than the other underwater vehicles with propellers that make noise			1
i hope animals treat @entity24 friendly			0
" as of its introduction this year , any swimmers that come into contact with the robot may hope for the same treatment			0

@entity5 is an underwater exploration vehicle
it is being developed by @entity10
it is set for its first *expedition* in may 2014
