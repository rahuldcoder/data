-- @entity1 writes best - selling fiction , but it was real - life drama -- a very public divorce -- that garnered her some of her biggest headlines			1
the nasty split with ex-husband @entity1 , the inspiration for the popular novel and movie " how @entity13 , " was dissected everywhere , from book blogs to " the @entity15			1
" a lawsuit , fraud allegations and public accusations all played out like plot points in one of her novels			2
a lot has changed since then			2
" i just ended up realizing i had become this other person that i did n't like , " @entity1 said			1
she is now friends with her ex ( " i just spoke to @entity1 on the phone yesterday " ) and has set out to explore other family dramas in her trademark candid and funny style			1
her new book , " who asked you ? , " explores grandparents raising grandchildren -- a topic that has long fascinated her			1
" one of the reasons that i write is because i 'm more interested in looking , as opposed to looking away , " @entity1 said			1
in the book , @entity41 , or @entity42 , is the matriarch of a family that includes an ailing husband , two sisters , a son in jail , a daughter on drugs and a son who is trying to forget where he came from			1
it delves into a serious topics from 15 viewpoints , an ambitious exploration of the inner lives of characters that are not normally given a voice			2
though it touches on drug abuse , coming out of the closet and prison sentences , " who asked you ? " still features the typical @entity1 humor and smart dialogue , connecting the themes through family and friendship			1
and while she insists her personal life has been an inspiration for her fiction , it is not the template			2
" a lot of the characters i write about are n't like me , with the exception there might be snippets or little particles of their personality that i might identify with , " she said			1
" the fact that they think this might be real -- that means i did my job			2
" @entity1 spoke to @entity0 about learning to trust her instincts , what she learned from a highly publicized divorce and where her life ends and art begins			1
an edited transcript of the conversation follows : @entity0 : what inspired you to write " who asked you ? " @entity1 : what inspired me to write this book was my ongoing or longstanding concern and curiosity about grandparents , and grandmothers in particular , who raise their grandchildren			1
i knew it would be a hardship story , and i did n't want it just to be that , based on the grandmother			2
so i also figured that there was another element that would probably lend itself to the story , one i was familiar with , and that is when you open your mouth to offer unsolicited advice , and people either resent it or do n't use it or do n't take it			2
and , when people do this , not just me , but when people offer advice , they do n't look at their own behavior			2
@entity0 : you have spoken about drawing from real - life observations and experiences for previous novels			1
how do you balance that public persona that people really relate to , with the fictional stories that some might assume to be the story of your life ? @entity1 : well , i 'll put it this way , i separate my personal life from what i write about regardless			1
this book is not necessarily a reflection of my own personal experiences			1
but there are certain things that are universal : disappointment , love , forgiveness , just a sense of responsibility , danger , etc. you just personalize that , you bring it down to ground level			0
@entity0 : one of the stories you drew from personal experience was " how @entity13 , " about an older woman who falls in love with a much younger man while on vacation			0
your subsequent divorce from @entity1 , your ex-husband who inspired the book , became a topic of discussion			1
what was the lesson you took away from that public divorce ? @entity1 : you have to go through what you go through , regardless of what other people say			1
and you should n't have to apologize for grieving			0
i was grieving , and i was angry -- two bad combinations			0
and so i had to go through it			0
it took awhile for me to realize that , to this day , i still love the @entity1 that i loved , that i was with eight of those 10 years			1
and i stopped holding myself emotionally hostage , and i stopped holding him responsible for it			0
i think that 's the lesson			1
but there 's no time limit on grief or anger until you start realizing it 's like a termite and it 's eating you up			1
that 's when you need to pay attention			1
and i realized also that i had given this man too much power over my life			0
and not only was he not worth it , but i was worth more			0
@entity0 : part of your appeal is having been such an authentic voice and being honest in sharing your personal life			0
do you ever regret sharing some parts because of reactions or reviews like the @entity201 that comment on your life as well as your books ? @entity1 : no. the bottom line is this -- this book had nothing to do with my personal life			1
it was n't even a reflection of it			0
the review was a short review , anyway ; it was only two paragraphs			0
the entire first paragraph , she spent reviewing me			0
which i thought was grossly unprofessional as well as just tacky			0
and plus it was tinged with anger			0
it was anger in that first paragraph			0
i mean , i can handle a bad review , especially if there 's something i can get out of it			2
i 've been out here too long			0
a lot of people make their own deductions about what 's real and what 's not real			2
personally i do n't really care , but when i go around and i do book tours , i often have cleared things up			2
and sometimes it shows up in print , and now with social media			0
there are people that know what i stand for and who i am			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know about you that they may not already know about you ? @entity1 : that i 'm a die - hard romantic			1
you get energized by ( love )			0
i do n't care what kind of love it is -- it could be a baby , a puppy			0
romantic love probably tops all of them			0
maybe -- i have n't had a grandchild yet .			0

best - selling author @entity1 's new book is " who asked you ? "
the book explores the relationship of grandmothers raising grandchildren
@entity1 : " i write *...* because i 'm more interested in looking , as opposed to looking away "
