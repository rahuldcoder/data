an independent report released monday into the execution of @entity3 inmate @entity2 revealed the state 's @entity4 followed protocol			1
" this independent review concluded that at all times following the administration of the execution protocol , the inmate was fully sedated , was totally unresponsive to stimuli , and as a result did not suffer , " said corrections director @entity7			1
" in fact , the @entity15 medical examiner is cited as reporting that the breathing pattern exhibited by the inmate prior to his death is a normal bodily response to dying , even in someone highly sedated , " @entity7 said			0
the report timeline for the july 23 execution confirmed previous accounts that it took two hours for @entity25 to die after the first drug protocol was administered at 1:40 p.m. and after the first lethal injection failed to kill @entity2 , executioners gave him 14 additional doses of a two - drug cocktail			1
during those two hours , witnesses including @entity2 's attorney claimed to have seen @entity2 snorting and struggling to breathe			1
@entity34 , a media witness from @entity35 , likened @entity2 's breathing to a " fish gulping for air			1
" the report timeline did not remark on @entity2 's breathing			1
after the staff administered a dose , they confirmed that @entity2 remained sedated			2
" the medical examiner in this case offered no apparent explanation for the time lapse that occurred in the @entity2 execution , " read the report			1
" the iv team leader , medical examiner and an independent correctional health expert agreed that the dosage administered was sufficient to cause death in a relatively short period of time			0
all agreed that the dosage of midazolam would result in heavy sedation			0
" the two - drug cocktail itself -- a mix of midazolam and hydromorphone -- came into question			0
@entity2 's attorney , @entity65 , argued the report did not " answer the question of why the experimental drug protocol did not work as promised			1
" in an open letter , @entity7 told @entity3 gov. @entity70 he intends to stop using the midazolam and hydromorphone cocktail and instead use a one - drug injection or a three - drug cocktail			2
" based on this report , i forwarded my assessment to governor @entity70 that the state continue efforts to procure drugs for the one - drug protocol , and begin the process to adopt three - drug protocols , as opposed to utilizing a modified two - drug protocol , " @entity7 said			2
@entity65 said he warned the @entity4 of the two - drug combination long before the execution			1
" the pre-identified problems came true , " @entity65 said			0
" the decision to now remove this formula is an acknowledgment by the @entity90 that it was wrong in choosing this combination of chemicals			0
" the independent review came at @entity70 's request			2
she directed the @entity4 to review the process citing concerns over the amount of time it took for @entity2 to die			2
a federal judge ordered local officials to preserve all physical evidence in @entity2 's execution			1
@entity2 was convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father			2
" you do n't know what excruciating is			0
what 's excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood , seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood			0
and i should n't really call him a man , " said @entity123 , a relative of @entity2 's victims			1
@entity2 was the latest @entity126 death row inmate to argue that an anesthetic recently introduced in some states ' execution protocols could fail to sufficiently knock out the inmate ahead of the lethal drugs , subjecting the person to an agonizing death			1
@entity2 claimed among other things that the state was going to use an " experimental " drug protocol			2
in documents filed with the state @entity138 , @entity2 contended the use of the anesthetic midazolam was problematic in recent @entity126 executions and that it would violate the @entity144 's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment			1
some states turned to midazolam this decade after they could no longer get sodium thiopental , a drug that was regularly used for executions			0
a @entity126 manufacturer stopped producing sodium thiopental in 2009 , and countries that still produce it wo n't allow its export to the @entity126 for use in lethal injections			0
earlier this year , @entity155 put executions on hold after the controversial execution of @entity158			0
@entity160 was part of the injection combination , and it took 43 minutes for him to die , @entity155 officials said			0
the @entity3 report remarked on the differences with the @entity155 case			0
" staff performance in no way contributed to the extended time lapse from initiation of the drug protocol to pronouncement of death			0
as noted , the execution was not ' botched " in comparison to what occurred in @entity155 with @entity158 , " said the report			1
" the state should release all of the documentation and witness reports that went into this review			0
only through discovery in a court of law will there be a truly independent and comprehensive examination of what went wrong during mr. @entity2 's nearly two - hour execution , " he said			1
@entity191 mom swaps death row for jail cell to await trial death penalty facts that may surprise you @entity198 's death penalty ruled unconstitutional			0

@entity2 execution was initially *believed* to be " botched "
a media witness likens @entity2 's breathing to a " fish gulping for air "
@entity2 had argued the combination for lethal injection was cruel and unusual punishment
