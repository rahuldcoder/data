-- no administration in modern times has been as confused , contradictory and incompetent in trying to make the case for war as this @entity5 has been in its push for action against the @entity9 regime of president @entity10			1
listen to the words of the @entity13 administration : on war and peace : at the @entity16 on friday , president @entity13 said as he pushed for strikes in @entity9 , " i was elected to end wars , not start them			1
i 've spent the last four and a half years doing everything i can to reduce our reliance on military power as a means of meeting our international obligations and protecting the @entity26 people			2
" then @entity13 signed onto a joint statement with 10 other nations present at @entity33 's @entity16 , " recognizing that @entity9 's conflict has no military solution , we reaffirm our commitment to seek a peaceful political settlement through full implementation of the 2012 @entity30			1
" on boots on the ground : testifying before the @entity39 , secretary of state @entity38 wavered on whether @entity26 ground forces could be deployed in @entity9			1
@entity38 told @entity39 chairman @entity41 , " i do n't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the @entity26 to secure our country			0
" then @entity38 backtracked when pressed by ranking member @entity47 , " let me be very clear now , because i do n't want anything coming out of this hearing that leaves any door open to any possibility , so let 's shut that door now as tight as we can			0
" @entity38 explained his contradiction by admitting , " i was thinking out loud			0
" on who supplied @entity10 with chemical weapons : defense secretary @entity58 told the @entity59 this week when asked where @entity10 got his chemical weapons , " the @entity62 supply them			1
" the @entity62 called that a lie and the @entity65 walked back the comment , saying @entity67 meant @entity62 supply conventional weapons to @entity9			1
on war objectives : gen. @entity70 , chairman of the @entity71 , could n't answer even the most basic question on @entity26 objectives on a @entity9 intervention			1
when @entity47 asked , " what is it you 're seeking ? " @entity70 replied , " i ca n't answer that , what we 're seeking			0
" on the cost of war : @entity67 told the @entity83 the entire @entity9 campaign 's cost , " would be in the tens of millions of dollars , that kind of range			1
" since @entity91 missiles cost about $ 1 million each , the administration would only be able to deploy several dozen missiles before going over its own budget			1
so this administration does not know if it wants war or peace , if it will need to deploy ground troops , where the chemical weapons it wants to eradicate come from , what our war objectives are and how much this war will cost			1
@entity62 president @entity106 attacked @entity38 's assertion that @entity108 and radical islamists comprise only a small part of the @entity112 rebels , saying @entity38 " is lying and he knows that he is lying			0
" that a foreign leader would so forcefully call @entity26 's top diplomat a liar points to the administration 's growing credibility gap with the world and the @entity26 people			2
retired gen. @entity123 chalks up the public relations disaster to amateurism , writing " [ military leaders ] are embarrassed to be associated with the amateurism of the @entity13 administration 's attempts to craft a plan that makes strategic sense			2
none of the @entity5 staff has any experience in war or understands it			0
" @entity123 has a point -- when the sitting secretary of state , while discussing matters of war , admits to " thinking out loud , " something is very wrong			0
every member of @entity141 should vote his or her conscience on matters of peace and war			2
after weeks of misstatements , contradictions and gaffes , it is becoming clear that the administration 's leaders are in way over their heads on these weighty matters			0
for members carefully weighing the decision to authorize force , they should know that a yes vote rewards the most incompetent , atonal security team in our lifetime			0
it will only encourage more incompetence			0
if they ca n't even explain the war , how can they win it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : administration officials seem confused on basic points
he asks : are they for military action or for peace ? what are the objectives ?
how much will it cost ? who supplied @entity9 with chemical weapons ?
@entity185 : administration officials have wavered on these *vital* questions
