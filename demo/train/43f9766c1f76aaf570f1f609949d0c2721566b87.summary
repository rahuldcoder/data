@entity58 and @entity57 were responding to a 911 call about " a gentleman walking around with a gun in the store , " pointing it at people and " waving it back and forth , " according to a recording of the call			0

" @entity4 concealed carry laws do n't regulate " open " care of firearms , so the open carry of firearms is " a legal activity in @entity4 , " the state 's attorney general office says			1

" the @entity10 family is seeking at least $ 75,000 in compensatory damages and an unstated amount for punitive damages , the suit said			1
the family alleges , among other things , that the police officers did not use due diligence to determine that @entity34 was n't a threat ; that the officers did n't give him enough time to put down the weapon ; and that @entity4 was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf , unpackaged and unsecured , for at least two days , the family 's lawyers said tuesday			1
the suit also accuses the police chief of failing to properly train and supervise the two officers			0
@entity10 was the father of a baby son , @entity212 , born last march , the suit said .			0
