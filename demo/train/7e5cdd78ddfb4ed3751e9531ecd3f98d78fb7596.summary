i use a @entity2 coffee machine at home because i 'm lazy			1
and , quite frankly , do n't feel like i 've really done my duty to @entity5 and country until i 've added a little something to the landfill			2
" here ya go , @entity10			2
" though , to be fair , i do actually use 97 % biodegradable @entity15 roast @entity13 from @entity16 , a brand of the @entity18 out of @entity19 , @entity20			2
mind you , i use these @entity13 not so much for environmental reasons , but because the price is right and i quite like the taste			2
i 'm still a delightfully lousy , wasteful human being			2
however , my day - to - day brand of single - serve coffee may soon be a thing of the past , because this fall @entity2 plans to launch a new system that will use @entity32 ( @entity32 ) technology			1
it 's fancy science , but ultimately it means unlicensed cups wo n't work with the new machines			1
@entity38 , senior public relations specialist from @entity39 , the parent company of @entity11 , could n't tell me exactly how their new interactive technology would work -- and even if she did i 'd probably have to take a 40 - minute nap -- but i did get the basics			1
" each @entity11 2.0 brewer will have a camera that can ' read ' a proprietary taggant material , " @entity38 says , adding that it 's similar to current anti-counterfeiting technology and will be " embedded on the lid of each @entity11 brand pack			1
" so , essentially , our coffee is going bionic , and if your current pod does n't have that taggant , it 's no coffee for you ! this includes my @entity13 from @entity16			1
which can only mean ... brace yourself			0
welcome to the @entity60 of 2014 ! @entity61 argues that its new advancements in roasting and flavor extraction , as well as thermodynamics , have been expertly developed to ensure perfect consistency with each cup			0
therefore , @entity38 told me , " it is critical for performance and safety reasons that the system only brews @entity11 brand packs			1
" and i did n't have to look far to find someone who agrees with that assessment			0
my co-worker , @entity77 , says he does n't want somebody 's inferior brand of @entity11 malfunctioning and screwing up his system , declaring from his desk three cubicles away , " the sanctity of the @entity11 should be respected ! " mind you , i once said the exact same thing about @entity85			1
it was 2:30 a.m. i was outside			0
" the sanctity of the @entity85 should be respected ! " looking back , that probably was n't my finest moment			0
anyway , while @entity2 says adding @entity32 is all about performance , @entity92 , founder and president of the @entity18 ( makers of my @entity16 coffee ) calls it " baloney			1
" he thinks it 's all about money and keeping @entity102 coffee out of your hands			1
by e-mail , he explained to me , " prices would be higher to the consumer			0
" in february , another company , @entity109 , even filed a lawsuit against @entity61			1
the @entity18 is considering legal action as well			0
@entity92 says , " if @entity39 is allowed to introduce @entity11 2.0 with the feature that , in our opinion , is clearly in restraint of trade , the @entity11 2.0 monopoly would be reinstated as it was when @entity2 was the only brewer on the market			1
" whatever happens , it 'll be interesting to see this play out over the coming months			0
but i do have to say that the new @entity123 are really sexy			0
@entity127 , in addition to brewing single cups , they 'll also do full carafes			2
so , never mind whose cup you choose ( or are allowed ) to brew			0
multiple sprints to the bathroom are coming			0
follow @ @entity134 on @entity135 .			0

in the fall , @entity2 plans to release their new 2.0 brewing system
the new systems will use @entity32 technology
@entity109 has filed a lawsuit against @entity2 's parent company
