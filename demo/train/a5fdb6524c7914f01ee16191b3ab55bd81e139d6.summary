-- first it was @entity3 , now it 's the turn of @entity4 to unveil the car they hope will speed them to victory in the forthcoming @entity10 season			1
the sport 's oldest team , based in @entity14 , @entity11 unveiled their new @entity16 car on their website on saturday			1
a raft of technical changes introduced for the 2014 season sees teams racing with , to the untrained eye at least , similar looking cars but vastly - changed setups -- most notably using smaller 1.6 - liter @entity26 engines compared to the 2.4 - liter @entity28 engines used last year			1

@entity38 - eyed observers will also note that the nose cone has been lowered and narrowed			0
along with @entity4 's new car comes a new driver -- the quietly charismatic @entity42 replaces @entity44 's @entity43 -- and new hope that the @entity46 and @entity48 's @entity47 can return the team to championship - winning ways			1
" we both want to win and time will tell what will happen and if we can bring the championship back to @entity4 , " @entity42 told the @entity4 website			1
" we are more than capable , both of us , to be up there and fight for championships			0
" @entity42 won the drivers championship in 2007 with @entity4 , the same year they won their last constructor 's championship			2
this year 's car is the 60th built by @entity4 for the @entity4 world championship with the @entity16 name being chosen by fans via a poll on the @entity4 team 's website			1
" it 's nice to know the name of the car has been chosen by our fans , " team principal @entity69 said			1
" the amazing number of votes shows just how popular @entity4 has always been and this will be , as always , a further impetus for us to do well this year !

the @entity91 - based team finished a lowly fifth , 193 points behind fourth place @entity95 , with neither @entity96 nor former teammate @entity97 managing a podium finish in 19 races			2
the @entity100 is a " sensible and calculated response to the new regulations , " @entity3 said			0
@entity102 , managing director of @entity3 said in a statement : " we 've never had such significant new regulations before ; reacting to them , and managing those changes , while still pushing the performance limits , has been an extremely tough job			0
" we 've been relatively pragmatic about it			0
we know that the need for consistency initially outweighs the need for performance -- the winter tests wo n't be about chasing set - up or refining the car ; the envelope of performance is likely to be so wide , and so relatively unknown , that the winter -- and to some extent the opening races -- will be about understanding the operational boundaries of the car as best we can			2
" @entity96 , who will be partnered by @entity125 this season , is looking forward to getting behind the wheel			2
" i 'm very keen to learn all about the new formula and our new car , and i want us to be in a position where we head to the opening flyaways feeling comfortable with our package , yet still ready to absorb and learn more as we go , " @entity96 said in a statement			0
testing for the new season , which starts in @entity135 on march 16 , begins at the end of january in @entity137 , @entity48 .			0
