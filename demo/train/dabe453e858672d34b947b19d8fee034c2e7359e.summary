-- as the @entity3 players stood silent on the football field in @entity5 , @entity6 , they could be forgiven for allowing their minds to wander			1
this game , a friendly against the @entity10 , was hardly significant given the scale of events which have taken place in @entity3 over the past fortnight			1
the contest , which was supposed to be played in @entity16 , @entity3 , was moved to @entity6 where less than 2,000 people came to witness two teams go through the motions			1
it was not just the @entity3 players who may have been preoccupied , the performance of weakened @entity10 side also raised questions over whether its squad had been affected by the late upheaval of switching the game			1
some @entity3 fans came with banners to support their country , while others appeared glad to have something to take their minds off what was happening at home			1
a 2 - 0 win thanks to goals from @entity36 and @entity37 may not register on the national consciousness at this moment in time -- but it gave them a brief respite from the trouble their country has endured			2
history makers elsehwere , football history was being made as @entity47 made its long - awaited debut in international football			1
there were no national anthems -- there were no flags , and in the end , there were no goals			2
but that did not detract from an emotional evening in @entity58 where @entity47 played its first ever @entity59 sanctioned friendly			1
a goalless draw against @entity61 in front of 17,000 people , came six years after @entity47 declared independence from @entity65			1
" bearing in mind our lack of preparation , the very difficult terrain ... and knowing the importance of this game we all have to be happy as we are all winners , " @entity47 coach @entity66 told reporters			1
" i am very happy with what i saw in this game			0
this is our first step in a very long journey ahead ... where our objective is ( qualifying for the ) @entity81			0
" we have shown that we deserve to be part of world football			0
" @entity47 , which does not have a seat at the @entity85 , is not a member of @entity59 nor @entity87			1
it was only after negotiations with the @entity89 that @entity59 declared in january that @entity47 could partake in friendly games as long as it did not display any national symbols , sing its national anthem or have its flag raised			1
@entity58 , which is home to some 5,000 soldiers in the @entity96 peace - keeping force , endured a 78 - day barrage of air strikes between 1998 - 99			0
record breaker elsewhere , @entity100 scored twice as @entity101 thrashed @entity102 5 - 1			0
@entity100 scored his 48th and 49th goal for his country to become @entity101 's all - time leading goalscorer			0
meanwhile , @entity106 overcame @entity107 2 - 0 in @entity108 thanks to goals from @entity110 and @entity111 , while @entity113 's late winner gave @entity114 a 1 - 0 victory against @entity116			1
@entity117 was made to fight all the way and was jeered from the pitch by supporters despite its 1 - 0 win over @entity122			0
@entity123 scored the only goal of the game with the visitors hitting the crossbar and @entity117 goalkeeper @entity128 making some impressive saves			0
" that was a lucky win			0
i can understand the jeers and whistles , " @entity117 captain @entity131 told reporters			0
" people pay good money to watch us and it 's clear that we have a lot of work to do before the @entity81			0
but we always prepare well for a @entity81 , so i am not worried			0
" world champion @entity141 defeated @entity143 1 - 0 in @entity145 courtesy of @entity147 's strike			2
@entity149 - born @entity148 made his debut for @entity141 but failed to shine			1
@entity151 became @entity153 's all - time leading goalscorer after netting twice during his side 's remarkable 4 - 3 defeat by @entity156			0
@entity153 had cruised into a 3 - 0 lead before @entity156 launched a stunning second half fightback			0

elsewhere , @entity163 was held to a 2 - 2 draw by @entity165 , @entity162 defeated @entity166 2 - 1 and @entity167 overcame @entity168 2 - 0			2
@entity149 @entity169 scored a stunning hat - trick as @entity149 cruised to a 5 - 0 win over @entity172 at @entity173 in @entity174			1
in the final warm - up game before its @entity81 squad is announced , @entity149 , which had won all four of its previous encounters against @entity172 by a one - goal margin , was in prolific form			1
after @entity180 had given @entity149 a 10th minute lead , @entity169 added two of his own before @entity184 midfielder @entity183 struck a 30 - yard screamer into the top corner			2
@entity169 scored his third and @entity149 's fifth in stoppage time from close range			2
@entity190 @entity191 vomited on the playing field during @entity190 's goalless draw with @entity194 in @entity195			1
