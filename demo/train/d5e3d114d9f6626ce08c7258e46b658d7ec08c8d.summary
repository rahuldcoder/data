it 's been seven years since " @entity1 " and " @entity2 " t - shirts were flying off the shelves			0
now , with rings on their fingers , it seems both women have moved on , yet the saga continues			0
many people are referencing @entity11 in the wake of @entity13 and @entity15 's engagement			1
and if countless headlines like , " anything @entity17 can do ! as @entity17 set to wed @entity23 , ex-wife @entity13 announces her engagement ... " are any indication , the media has no intention of giving up on the love triangle			1
even @entity26 commenters have taken sides , perpetuating a fictitious ( we imagine ) rivalry between the actresses			1
opinion : we care that @entity13 's getting married			1
why ? " @entity17 so traded down ... congrats @entity33 & @entity15 i hope you all beat the odds and live happily ever after , " commenter @entity37 wrote			0
some commenters ' well wishes were masked by unkind words for @entity23 : " she 's the underdog ! we always root for the underdog			1
@entity17 left her for a puffy lipped bomb shell ! she got dumped ! plus the entire world talked about it			0
. so you go @entity13 ! " james648 wrote			1
@entity13 has also received her fair share of flak : " something must be wrong with her , @entity17 dropped her like a bad habit			1
" so why continue picking sides ? " we like to take sides on everything , " said @entity54 , who owns @entity55 , a boutique that sold @entity1 and @entity2 shirts back in 2005			0
" the thing with @entity13 is that she was in peoples ' living rooms for ( 10 ) years			1
... people felt like they were one of her friends ... whereas @entity23 was n't in our living rooms			1
" that might be why @entity1 shirts sold faster than @entity2 shirts , @entity54 said , adding , " it was 25 to one at the beginning			0
" but do n't feel bad for @entity23 just yet			2
her fans have since shown support by purchasing " @entity77 " paraphernalia			0
" my guess is that most people on @entity2 would not be focusing on the fact that @entity17 left @entity13 for her , " said @entity78 , a professor of psychology at @entity80 at @entity81 and editor of the @entity84 journal of @entity85			2
" they 're more seeing @entity23 as this strong independent single woman who is both happily ( engaged ) and successful in her career and doing all this stuff with the travel and the charity and these generally positive things			2
" " @entity1 , " @entity97 added , " more identifies with the girl next - door side who has been screwed over by her man			0
" even though both women are engaged , @entity54 said he does n't anticipate any " mrs. @entity103 " or " @entity105 " t - shirts			0
" we do n't want to dig up the past , " he said			0
some @entity26 commenters , like @entity109 , echoed his sentiment : " i do n't condone cheaters ( if that is what happened with @entity17 and @entity23 , who really knows ) but what i do know is that life is too short to stay in an unhappy marriage			1
i think it 's absurd that the public want to paint @entity13 as this ' wronged ' woman for the rest of her life			2
my @entity123 folks , lets just move on and let it go ! " @entity13 's men			2
