-- in case you have n't heard , nothing worthwhile will happen in @entity4 until after the midterm elections			2
that 's the conventional wisdom anyway , where the thinking is that a bitterly divided @entity8 will be lucky to name a post office , let alone deal with pressing issues like the budget or jobs			1
the conventional wisdom is wrong			2
on wednesday , something important is happening in @entity4			2
on that day , a bipartisan group featuring dozens of members of @entity8 , state and local leaders and business , citizen and community leaders is gathering at the @entity22 to kick off a yearlong process to set a path for where @entity25 needs to go and how we get there			1
this is n't the type of gathering you 'd expect six weeks out from an election			2
these days , members of the two parties barely talk , let alone work with one another			0
to crib an old @entity37 line from " @entity38 " : the sight of @entity40 and @entity41 actually meeting together may cause mass hysteria			1
the subject of debate will be @entity45 , which sets a framework for action on four goals chosen with input from a nationwide survey that @entity22 conducted last fall : create 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years ; balance the federal budget by 2030 ; secure @entity53 and @entity54 for the next 75 years ; and make @entity25 energy - secure by 2024			1
the process to create @entity45 has been endorsed by over 80 members of @entity8 , and it 's coming together with an entirely original approach			1
this is not just another policy plan			1
in fact , at this point , the @entity45 is n't a policy plan at all , because its details will be filled in over the next year -- with input from people across @entity25			1
this agenda will be developed in a step - by - step fashion that solves problems the way they should be solved			1
the way we tried to solve problems when we served as the governors of @entity76 and @entity77			0
at the @entity22 , participants will join working groups ( with a member of @entity8 in each group ) to focus on one of the four signature goals , progress to agreement on the fundamental facts , and conclude by agreeing on broad policy principles that can inform the creation of specific policy and legislative solutions			1
subsequent meetings in @entity92 , @entity93 and elsewhere will take a similar approach			0
the effort will culminate on october 5 , 2015 , when the fully formed @entity45 will be unveiled in @entity92 and @entity93			0
no labels will work to inject the agenda into the emerging presidential debate by activating our network of citizens , members of @entity8 , and state and local leaders			1
the ultimate aim of this exercise is for the next president and the next @entity8 to use the @entity45 as a basis for bipartisan action			1
like everything @entity22 has proposed since its launch in december 2010 , the @entity45 will be a product of discussion and agreement from every part of the political spectrum			0
we do n't for a moment underestimate how hard it will be for a future @entity8 and president to coalesce around even one of these goals			1
but difficulty is no excuse for inaction			0
for too long , @entity4 has been a place defined by all tactics , and no strategy			2
we spend all our time focused on winning the day , the week or the next election , and in the process , we 've lost sight of doing what 's necessary for @entity25 to win the future			2
with the @entity45 , @entity22 is bringing a unity of purpose that has been missing in our government			0
we 're not just identifying what needs to be done			0
we 've developed a rigorous process for how it gets done			0
to the many millions of @entity25 who are wondering what , if anything , they can do to fix the dysfunction in our government , this is your chance to get involved			2
these @entity45 meetings could be coming to a town near you , and you can help determine what is in the final plan			2
if you ca n't make a meeting , you can still work to ensure that candidates and members of @entity8 endorse the @entity45			1
this is no time to let frustration with the political process lead you to tune out			0
because @entity25 is facing a fork in the road			0
we can continue the partisan fighting and failures of the last decade			0
or we can choose a different path			0
our leaders can come together around a shared vision to deliver good jobs , a balanced budget , peace of mind for our seniors and energy security			1
we 've done it before			0
we can do it again .			0

a group of @entity41 , @entity40 , *independents* looks to shape a national agenda
@entity176 , @entity177 : the plan is to develop long term goals for next president , @entity8
securing the future of @entity54 , adding millions of new jobs are among the goals
ideas *include* balancing budget by 2030 , attaining energy security by 2024
