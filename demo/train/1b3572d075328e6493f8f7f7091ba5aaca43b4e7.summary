@entity0 , @entity1 -- a defense attorney tuesday tried to poke holes in the highly emotional testimony of the first witness in the murder trial of @entity10 double - amputee @entity8 , as another witness said she also heard screams the night model @entity13 was killed			1
on the second day of the trial , testimony continued with the questioning of @entity8 ' neighbor , @entity17 , who said monday she was awakened by screams , followed by gunshots , when @entity8 shot and killed his girlfriend on @entity21 last year			1
defense attorney @entity22 attacked @entity24 's credibility , accusing her of using her husband 's statement to craft her own			2
paragraph by paragraph , @entity22 pointed out similarities between their two statements			2
@entity24 repeatedly explained that the statements were similar because they both heard the same thing			2
" i 'm as honest as i can be to the court , " she said			2
@entity8 has admitted he killed @entity13 but pleaded not guilty , saying that he mistakenly believed he was shooting a burglar			1
he only realized after firing four shots that his girlfriend was not in bed but in the bathroom he was firing at , his defense team said on his behalf monday			2
@entity24 cried when she described the gunfire			2
" it was awful to hear the shots , " she said through tears			0
on monday , @entity24 testified that , " something terrible was happening at that house			0
" she called the shouts and screams " petrifying			0
" @entity22 questioned how @entity24 had heard the screams from far away : " you heard that out of a closed toilet in a house 177 meters away ? " clearly rattled at times , she was granted a small reprieve as the court adjourned to investigate claims her image had been seen on television -- a violation of her right to remain anonymous			0
the case has fascinated @entity1 and much of the world , with its high - profile defendant , the double - amputee track star so talented that he competed not only in the @entity65 but against able - bodied runners in the @entity67 two years ago			1
neighbors heard shouting a second witness , another of @entity8 ' neighbors , told the court tuesday she also was awoken by shouting on the night @entity13 was killed			1
in brief testimony , @entity73 said she heard loud voices that went on for about an hour and put a pillow over her head to try to get back to sleep			0
she said she heard four sounds but could not be sure what they were			0
@entity24 's husband , @entity82 , was the third witness to take to the stand before the court adjourned for the day			1
describing what he heard from his home that night , he said the " intensity and fear in ( the woman 's ) voice escalated and it was clear that her life was in danger			2
" " that 's when the first shots were fired			0
i remember hearing a succession of shots , " @entity82 said			0
" i heard the lady scream again and the last scream faded moments after the last shot was fired			2
" prosecutor @entity104 , reading a report from an expert , told the court that of the four bullets that were fired toward @entity13 : " the fourth bullet hit her in the head			1
" at this remark , @entity8 clutched his head in his hands			1
live updates : @entity8 on trial for murder testy testimony @entity24 's testimony has been marked by confusion at times			1
after @entity22 had asked her a question several times tuesday , judge @entity119 intervened : " when counsel asks a question , you answer that question ... the quicker way to get out of that ( witness ) box is to answer exactly what counsel is asking			1
" during @entity104 's questioning monday , @entity24 told the court that she heard a woman 's screams and a man yelling for help			0
" just after 3 , i woke up from a woman 's terrible screams , " she said			0
" then i also heard a man screaming for help			0
three times he yelled for help			0
" she assumed a nearby home was being invaded by criminals			2
she later told her husband that she feared the woman had witnessed her husband being shot " because after he screamed , we did n't hear him			1
" @entity22 spent hours hammering @entity24 with questions in monday 's cross-examination , asking repeatedly if there could have been shots before she woke up , if she was sure about the sequence of events and about her knowledge of guns			0
he asked if the " bang " sounds she heard might not have been gunshots , but rather a cricket bat bashing at a bathroom door			0
she answered that she had clearly heard gunshots , testily answering @entity22 's questions about how much time had elapsed between them by saying she " did n't sit there with a stopwatch and take down the timing of each shot			2
" moments of low comedy despite the serious subject of the trial , there were lighter moments , such as when @entity22 described the voice of @entity8 as sounding " like a woman screaming " when he 's anxious			1
" i 'm 100 % certain i heard two different people that evening , " @entity24 insisted			0
there also was repeated confusion , irritation and befuddlement over the language in which @entity24 testified			0
she spoke @entity187 , her native language , and had an interpreter translate her words into @entity191			0
personal essay : what my son taught me about @entity8 but she regularly corrected her interpreter 's @entity191 and had a brief discussion in @entity191 with the judge about whether she should testify in that language			1
it was agreed she would continue to testify in @entity187 , but she repeatedly lapsed back into @entity191			0
@entity8 pleaded not guilty monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with @entity13 's killing , as well as two gun indictments unrelated to @entity13			1
it 's expected to take at least three weeks for judge @entity119 to hear the case and decide whether @entity8 mistook @entity13 for a burglar or killed her in cold blood			1
in @entity1 , which abolished jury trials in 1969 , premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence , with a minimum of 25 years			0
@entity8 also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge			1
interactive : explore each side 's argument if he is n't convicted of premeditated murder , the sprinter could face a lesser charge of " culpable homicide , " a crime based on negligence , and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge , experts say			2
parts of @entity8 ' trial are being televised live -- a first in @entity1 -- after a judge 's decision last week allowing cameras in the courtroom			1
but witnesses have the option of not having their images televised			0
the witnesses so far have taken that option			0
june @entity13 , @entity13 's mother , was in the courtroom for monday 's testimony , marking the first time she had laid eyes on @entity8 in person			1
the two had never met before			0
@entity13 's parents have avoided previous court appearances because they wanted privacy			1
dream couple @entity8 , now 27 , and @entity13 , 29 when she died , were a young , attractive , high - profile couple popular in @entity1 's social circles			1
@entity8 , nicknamed the " @entity8 " because of the special prostheses he uses while running , won six @entity65 gold medals and became the first double - amputee runner to compete in the @entity67 , in @entity255 in 2012			1
cover girl @entity13 , who was soon to star in a tv reality show , was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right			1
everything changed before dawn on @entity21 2013 , as @entity13 lay lifeless in a pool of blood on the floor of her boyfriend 's house in an upscale gated community in @entity0			1
moments before , @entity8 says , he had pointed his 9 mm pistol toward an upstairs toilet room and fired four bullets through the locked door			1
in court documents , @entity8 has said he heard a noise from the bathroom in the middle of the night and -- feeling vulnerable without his prosthetic legs on -- charged toward the bathroom on his stumps			1
he has said he shot through the toilet door in order to protect himself and @entity13			1
" i felt a sense of terror rushing over me , " he said in his court affidavit			0
" there are no burglar bars across the bathroom window , and i knew that contractors who worked at my house had left the ladders outside			2
" " it filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet			0
i thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window			0
as i did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable , i knew i had to protect @entity13 and myself			1
" prosecutors are painting a different picture			0
they say the pair had an argument and that @entity13 locked herself in the toilet			2
at last year 's bail hearing , the state said @entity8 put on his prosthetic legs , collected his gun from under the bed and walked down the hall leading from the bedroom to the bathroom before unloading a flurry of shots through the door			1
@entity8 is not claiming self - defense ; he is claiming to have been mistaken about his need for self - defense			1
he is denying that he intentionally , unlawfully killed @entity13			1
he has never denied killing her			0
the case has put the spotlight on @entity1 's rampant gun violence and high crime rates			0
roughly 45 people are murdered every day , according to police statistics , and the number of home burglaries is up 70 % in the last decade			2
in 2012 , more than half of @entity1 told the country 's police force that they were afraid of having their homes broken into			0
in his affidavit , @entity8 said he had been the victim of violence and burglaries before , including death threats			2
@entity2 's @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 contributed to this report .			0
