-- let me start by saying " @entity2 : assassins of @entity6 " is rated 'm for @entity3 ' for a very good reason			2
there is more cursing in the game than at a @entity12 / @entity11 playoff game and quite a bit of nearly full frontal nudity			1
developers at @entity16 have been very upfront about this title being for adult audiences and make sure people ca n't be surprised by the content			2
even the storyline involving , monster - hunter extraordinaire @entity21 , is more in line with a plot from " @entity26 " with its political intrigue , backstabbing and power struggles , than your typical " kill the monsters " role playing game ( @entity32 )			1
" @entity2 : assassins of @entity6 " was released last year as a pc - exclusive title , but the game was recently ported to the @entity35 to open it up to console audiences			1
the " @entity42 " for the @entity35 also offers new content , about four more hours of gameplay and many updates to the interface			1
using the @entity35 controller to narrate the action can be quite the agility test			1
each button , including the triggers and shoulder buttons , will be used constantly and , sometimes , in a hurry			2
preparations for combat , which are almost always necessary , will require multiple button pushes to cycle through numerous menus for potions , oils and the like			1
if hacking and slashing your way through a campaign is your style , this game is not for you			1
here , combat is largely about proper preparation before battle , then making sure to use the right combination of attacks -- depending upon your opponents			1
fortunately , the action slows or stops when you try to access magic ( " signs " ) , but that also requires a couple of button mashes , some joystick movement , then more mashing to get back to the action			0
while the pc version allows for hotkeys to make accessing abilities faster and easier , the console controller does n't have that option			1
it takes some getting used to , but becomes second nature as the game progresses			1
as with most rpgs , there is a certain amount of hunting and gathering that goes on			0
all different kinds of herbs , trinkets and supplies are lying around , waiting for @entity21 to pick them up and convert them into potions , armor or oils			0
inventories will fill up fast , but you 'll need every scrap to gain advantages in combat			1
leveling up through earned experience allows players to augment certain abilities through skill trees			0
a training skill tree is unlocked at the beginning and lets players enhance abilities			1
the other three trees will help shape how @entity21 plays and where his strengths will lie			0
a magic skill tree powers up spells and unlocks new mystical abilities			2
the alchemy skill tree boosts gathering and blending abilities as well as increasing the effects of potions and oils			2
the swordsmanship tree is all about the combat , boosting defenses and damage through different skills learned			1
players will have to concentrate on one of the three specialty trees to really get the best abilities			0
each level @entity21 gains gives him points to unlock new abilities , and every ability has two levels to unlock its maximum impact			0
the environments are fabulously rendered and the lighting is superb			0
buildings have their own individuality and subterranean areas do n't just feel like recipients of a copy - and - paste tool job that some games appear to rely upon			0
different races look and sound unique and the level of immersion is very deep and rich			0
the missions and side missions follow along a fairly laid - out path			0
for all the environmental splendor , there is little reason to go wandering around the countryside unless you just want to see how much work the developers put into the forests ( hint : a lot ; it is gorgeous )			0
the story is all about king - killing , kingdom - making and political intrigue			0
some of the dialog would probably play out very well in the halls of @entity167 ( minus all the swearing , i think )			0
even though @entity21 is a renowned monster hunter , there are very few true monsters to be slain			0
yet , it is all done within the context of the story and accomplished very well			0
a few buggy moments slow down the game			2
following other characters during missions can be hit and miss as the leader is stopped or slowed down by every rock , twig and bump in the road			0
however , it only bogs down the pace and never crashes the game			2
overall , " @entity2 : assassins of @entity6 " does a great job of extending its legacy with a deep storyline , intricate combat and a level of immersion that keeps players interested and involved			2
the mature plot is handled very well , not getting bogged down in the minutiae of drama for drama 's sake			1
cursing and nudity aside , the mature themes are really aimed at an audience who is interested in living the lifestyle of another the era rather than just killing everything in sight			1
" @entity2 : assassins of @entity6 " is available now for the @entity35			1
it was previously released for the @entity208 in may 2011			0
it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence , nudity , strong language , strong sexual content , and use of drugs			2
this review was done with the @entity42 for the @entity35 .			1

the game was recently ported to the @entity35 to open it up to console audience
