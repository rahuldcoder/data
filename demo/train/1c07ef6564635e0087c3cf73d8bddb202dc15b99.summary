-- what @entity2 wants , he gets			1
after all , he wanted @entity4 for years , and is now set to marry her in may			2
( they already welcomed their first child together , @entity7 , last june			2
) so should we be surprised that the rapper , who 's previously campaigned for his bride - to - be to appear on the cover of @entity12 , can place a checkmark next to that goal ? it 's true			1
@entity4 and @entity16 are appearing on the april issue of @entity12			1
and this , soon after @entity2 proclaimed on @entity19 's radio show that it was preposterous it had not yet happened			2
" there 's no way @entity4 should n't be on the cover of @entity12 , " @entity2 told @entity19 back in october			1
" she 's like the most intriguing woman right now			2
... and collectively , we 're the most influential in clothing			0
" " no one is looking at what @entity30 is wearing			0
@entity30 ca n't instagram a ( bathing suit ) pic like what my girl instagrammed the other day			0
" the cover is vaguely reminiscent of @entity4 's other high - profile appearance on the front of @entity40 in 2011 , when she posed with her then - @entity42 © , basketball player @entity43			1
except this time , she 's traded in the contemporary clothing for sumptuous luxury wares			0
calling @entity4 and @entity16 # theworldsmosttalkedaboutcouple , @entity12 is promising a firsthand look inside the pair 's " fashionable life and surreal times , " including a glimpse of how they interact as parents			1
the pair 's daughter , @entity7 , appears with them in a behind - the - scenes video of the @entity12 photo shoot			1
the unveiling of the issue , which arrives on newsstands march 31 and digitally march 24 , was met with a mix of reactions , from stunned to supportive to upset			1
" somewhere , @entity65 is flipping a table , " joked one observer			0
" vogue negotiates with terrorists , " quipped another			0
@entity12 is n't a stranger to controversy -- earlier this year it was criticized by some for its treatment of " girls " star @entity74 -- but the vitriol directed toward @entity12 editor @entity76 regarding the april issue has been visceral			1
" if someone could start a petition to have @entity76 fired over this , society would appreciate it , " said @ @entity78			0
you 're mentally unstable , " chimed in @ @entity83			0
" i just wonder what went through @entity76 's mind			0
has she gone mad ? " asked another onlooker			0
given the timing of the issue , a handful wondered if @entity12 was pulling some sort of elaborate ( not to mention expensive ) @entity95 prank			2
fans of the couple were just as breathless as @entity4 tweeted she was when they spotted the pair 's glossy cover shot			1
" if you 're actually mad at @entity4 and @entity2 's @entity12 cover , " tweeted @ @entity100 , " go outside , start walking and do n't stop until you reach the horizon			1
" added @ @entity108 , " @entity4 and @entity2 refuse to accept the limitations people try to put on them and it 's inspiring			1
" mostly , though , it looks some are just confused by the # worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple hashtag @entity12 is trying to promote			2
" wait , " said @ @entity113			0
" that does n't look like @entity115 and @entity116			0

@entity2 and @entity4 are on the cover of @entity12 's april issue
@entity2 had previously said he *believed* there was no reason @entity4 should n't be on the cover
the couple 's daughter @entity7 was also present at the photo shoot
the issue arrives digitally march 24 and on newsstands march 31
