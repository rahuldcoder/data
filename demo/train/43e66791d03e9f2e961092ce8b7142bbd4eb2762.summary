-- violence in recent weeks has prompted a " slow but steady exodus " of @entity5 from the @entity7 cities of @entity8 and @entity9 , the @entity2 refugee agency said on friday			1
the trend started after a @entity8 church attack on october 31 and subsequent targeted attacks of @entity5 in @entity8 and @entity9			1
the total death toll at @entity14 in @entity8 was 70 , and 53 of the people killed in the strike were @entity5 , a minority group in a predominantly @entity19 nation			1
@entity2 offices in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 are reporting a growing number of @entity7 @entity26 arrivals			1
the @entity2 high commissioner for refugees said @entity8 and @entity9 @entity5 have been headed to other destinations in @entity7 , such as the @entity30 region and the @entity31 , a region in the north with a strong @entity26 presence			1
" we have heard many accounts of people fleeing their homes after receiving direct threats			2
some were able to take only a few belongings with them , " the agency said in a statement			0
" churches and @entity44 are warning us to expect more people fleeing in the coming weeks			2
" in @entity21 , since november , about 133 families , or 300 people , have registered with @entity48 , " the majority of whom fled @entity7 following the october church attack in @entity8			0
" in @entity22 , the number of registrations of @entity5 during october and november doubled from the same period last year			1
in september , 57 @entity5 had been registered and the figure rose to 98 and 109 in october and november respectively			1
" one man who is now registered with @entity48 in @entity22 narrowly escaped the attack , having left the church minutes before the bombing took place			0
this refugee had been deported from @entity62 just days beforehand , " the statement said			0
because of the recent hostilities , the agency urges " countries to refrain from deporting @entity7 who originate from the most perilous parts of the country			2
" @entity48 said it was " dismayed " that @entity69 on wednesday forcibly returned a group of some 20 @entity7 , five of whom were @entity5 from @entity8			2
" one of the @entity26 men said he escaped @entity7 in 2007 after militiamen directly threatened to kill him			0
fearing for his life , he traveled through several countries in the @entity79 and @entity62 before reaching @entity69 where he applied for asylum			0
" he said his claim was rejected three times in 2008 and that his claims were not accepted as he was not considered to have been personally targeted			0
the others we spoke to said their asylum claims were rejected on the basis of improved security conditions in @entity7			0
" @entity48 said asylum seekers from @entity8 , @entity90 , @entity31 , @entity91 and @entity93 provinces should n't be returned by other countries and should get some form of protection			1
the agency said that despite @entity7 's efforts to protect minority groups and their places of worship and an overall decrease in civilian casualties , these people are " increasingly susceptible to threats and attacks			0
" " our position reflects the volatile security situation and the still high level of violence , security incidents , and human rights violations taking place in parts of @entity7			0
@entity48 considers that serious -- including indiscriminate -- threats to life , physical integrity or freedom resulting from violence or events seriously disturbing public order are valid reasons for international protection , " the @entity2 agency said .			1
