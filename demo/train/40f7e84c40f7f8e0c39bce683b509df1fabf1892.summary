@entity0 -- depending on whom you ask , either @entity5 efforts to force big - dollar donors out of the shadows are a smokescreen that hides union clout , or @entity10 opposing the efforts are just blowing smoke in an attempt to ensure well - heeled donors stay anonymous			1
" right around an election , when the campaigns start rolling in the money , we 're going to hear about disclosure from whichever side is getting less , " said @entity15 , a government affairs consultant who lobbies for financial transparency for the @entity17			1
" whichever party is feeling beaten up is going to say , ' we need to fix it			0
' " keenly aware that @entity10 presidential candidate @entity26 has out - raised president @entity27 in direct contributions for the past two months , @entity5 twice brought a @entity30 bill to the floor aimed at unmasking wealthy , secret donors to outside groups -- the kind that have thrown their weight behind @entity10 candidates this election cycle			1
nearly 700 independent political groups have poured more than $ 187 million into 2012 campaigns nationwide so far , according to @entity42 records compiled by the @entity43			0
more than $ 41 million of that has come from groups that disclose only a limited amount of information about their donors , or none at all			1
@entity51 : top super @entity53 donors about $ 140 million of the total has been spent by conservative groups , with most of that laid out during the @entity10 presidential primary battles , according to the group , which runs the campaign - finance website @entity43			1
it 's @entity5 concerns about that kind of money that led to two votes this week on a bill called the @entity66 , which would have required organizations that spend money on politics to name donors who give more than $ 10,000			1
republicans successfully filibustered the measure both times , with @entity30 minority leader @entity74 accusing @entity5 of seeking to cow president @entity27 's opponents into submission by making activist groups name their high - dollar donors			1
" democrats can call this bill whatever they want , but they can not conceal its true intent , which is to encourage their allies and discourage their critics from exercising their first amendment right to speak their mind , " @entity79 said			0
republicans also complained that the measure gave an unfair break to labor unions , which typically contribute to @entity5			1
unions have to disclose their expenditures , but individual members ' dues would most likely fall below the $ 10,000 threshold for disclosure			2
" what is the final difference between one $ 10,000 check and 1,000 $ 10 checks ? , " asked sen. @entity96 , @entity97 , co-author of a bipartisan 2002 campaign finance law			0
" other than the impact on trees , very little			0
so why should one be free from having to disclose its origin ? " @entity30 @entity10 block @entity66 for second straight day @entity106 , executive director of the @entity43 , says the power of unions is " incontrovertible			1
" but unions already disclose the amount they spend , and its source -- members ' dues -- is a known quantity , she said			2
" what we do n't know is who is bankrolling these patriotic - sounding but vague and unfamiliar groups which are funded to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by individuals , by corporations and trade associations , " she said			2
" ... we do n't have good enough and routine enough information about union spending to these outside groups , but we have no information from the other side			0
" labor groups now have to report political expenditures of more than $ 5,000 , though they do n't have to disclose individual members whose dues are pooled to provide that money			0
@entity133 labor lawyer @entity132 told @entity1 that 's not a break for the unions , just a reflection of the comparative wealth involved			2
opinion : why @entity5 need labor unions " the @entity10 are essentially crying foul because individual union members are not wealthy enough , " said @entity132 , whose firm of @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 has represented several public - and private - sector unions			1
" if we were to go back to square one , i do n't think anyone on labor 's side of the fence is particularly happy the floodgates have been opened with respect to political spending , " @entity132 said			0
but he added , " workers are never going to have as much money as the bosses , and that 's just a fact			0
and you should n't punish workers for banding together to get some sort of a voice in the process			0
" @entity5 say legislation is necessary to stanch the tide of money that has been pouring into @entity170 politics since the 2010 @entity172 decision in the @entity174 case			0
that ruling struck down some long - standing limits on campaign spending by corporations , unions and other groups			1
a previous version passed the @entity182 in 2010 , but also fell to a @entity10 filibuster			1
@entity190 : " ... there is nothing free about an election purchased by a handful of billionaires for their own self - interest			2
" " instead of standing up for the @entity170 people , @entity10 stood with big banks and oil companiesâ € ” special interests that certainly do n't need more clout in @entity0 , " president @entity27 said monday in a statement released after @entity10 successfully blocked the @entity66			1
and senate majority leader @entity190 said the $ 10,000 limit was added at the request of the @entity200 , the @entity10 - leaning gun - rights lobby			1
" we thought that perhaps with the @entity200 having so much power on the @entity10 , that we would raise that to $ 10,000 , which we were told would make them happy , " the @entity204 @entity203 said before tuesday 's vote on the legislation			1
" but it did n't make any difference to the @entity10			1
" a longtime foe of any campaign finance legislation , @entity79 has argued that full disclosure of campaign donations is " the best disinfectant , " as he told @entity217 in 1997 -- but he 's also qualified that call by saying it should be limited to groups directly involved in politics , not " issue advocacy " groups like those unleashed by the court 's ruling in the @entity227 case			0
but the opposition had some high - profile opponents on the left as well			2
the @entity233 opposed both the 2010 and 2012 versions , noting that some features it supported in the previous bill -- such as making corporations disclose their political spending to shareholders and requiring broadcaster to provide low - cost airtime -- were n't included this year			2
" measures intended to root out corruption should not interfere with freedom of expression by those wishing to make their voices heard , and disclosure requirements should not have a chilling effect on the exercise of rights of expression and association , especially in the case of controversial political groups , " several of the @entity233 's top lawyers wrote in march			0
and @entity260 sen. @entity259 , a moderate @entity10 who has supported earlier overhauls of campaign - finance law , dismissed the @entity66 as an election - year stunt by @entity5			1
" i have long believed that @entity170 have the right to know who is contributing to political campaigns , and i share the serious concerns of so many who believe that outside , third party groups , should not be allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money without revealing the names of donors , " @entity264 said in a statement to @entity1			2
" that is why it is so frustrating that we find ourselves , once again , being asked to consider a partisan bill that would not fix the real problem			0
" meanwhile , @entity27 and @entity26 have benefited from the deluge of campaign cash pouring in from the " super pacs " spawned by the @entity227 decision			2
pro-obama super pac raises $ 6.1 million in june the @entity285 has raised more than $ 61 million , according to @entity43 and spent $ 53 million of that			0
the @entity27 - allied @entity287 has raised nearly $ 15 million and spent about $ 10 million , while during the @entity10 primaries , the super pac that backed former house speaker @entity290 's failed campaign raised nearly $ 24 million and spent all but a few hundred thousand			1
pro-romney super pac brings in $ 20 million in june all unions combined have put about $ 52 million into the 2012 elections so far , according to @entity43			0
about $ 30 million of that has gone to @entity5 , roughly $ 4 million to republicans and the rest to independent groups			0
rarely do big - dollar donors to either candidate rush forward to give their names and declare how much they 've contributed			1
" @entity51 is never going to run short in our political system , " the @entity17 's @entity15 said			0
" where it does run short is ( what 's fair ) for the average voter and the average citizen ... if you are a voter and you 're being bombarded with negative ads and you do n't know whose behind them			0
" does big money spell big trouble in campaigns ? @entity1 's @entity313 and @entity314 contributed			0

@entity203 and @entity10 leaders are battling over disclosing big - dollar donors
the fight is *fueled* in part by a huge influx of cash by anonymous donors and unions
voters are the *ultimate* losers in this fight over transparency , some politicos say
