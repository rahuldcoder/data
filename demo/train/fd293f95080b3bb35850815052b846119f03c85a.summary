-- social media sites have evolved into the global equivalent of the office watercooler , but could the buzz they generate be analyzed to predict real - world outcomes ? leading @entity8 economist @entity7 thinks so			1
she believes analyzing the chatter from @entity10 and @entity11 for example , will become a dominant force in the business of forecasting			1

because , if we could improve upon the political forecasts ; if we could improve upon sales forecasts by listening in on people 's chatter on @entity10 , @entity11 , those sorts of media , that would be a really exciting prospect. , " she said			0
her and a team of computer scientists , sociologists , and economists worked together to develop a method of research that they hoped would enable them to predict the winner of talent contest " @entity55 "			1
by developing a sophisticated algorithm , the team effectively " listened in " on hundreds of thousands of tweets at once and deduced not just the number and subject of messages but also , for the first time , the sentiment			0
in doing so they were able to make an accurate guess about who would stay and go each week			0

an influential economist , @entity25 has a knack for prescience that has put her ahead of the curve among her peers			1
her work is all about conducting research that gives raw data some context			0
it 's about understanding the culture , language and psychology of social media users , which , she says , has huge implications for both business and government			1
under her school of her thought , in order for social media marketing to have any real value we need to understand what people 's actions really mean			1
" if somebody tweets ' i like @entity119 ' , does that mean that they 're actually going to buy @entity119 ? one can ? two cans ? three cans ? if they retweet someone else 's @entity10 , does that mean they 're going to buy it ?
