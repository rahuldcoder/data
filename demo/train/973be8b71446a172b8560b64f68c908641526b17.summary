-- on one hand , @entity1 is still scoring goals for fun and @entity5 is starting to justify his mammoth transfer fee			0
on the other , @entity8 's defensive game is appalling			2
@entity9 , who learned the game in a league where solidity at the back is everything , must be having kittens			0
so would you if your team took a three - goal lead against the bottom team in @entity20 , then proceeded to hang on nervously for a 3 - 2 win that so easily could 've ended in misery			1
especially when your previous outing started similarly and ended in a 7 - 3 scoreline			0
and even more so when your next game is a trip to @entity27 in the @entity28			0
" a disaster , " @entity9 called saturday 's second - half display against city rival @entity30 , a team which had conceded 27 goals and scored just eight in 11 previous @entity34 league matches			1
" against @entity37 we were 3 - 0 up and let them back into the game			1
today the same thing happened and that is not a coincidence , " the @entity40 told reporters			0
" we need to change and remove the superficiality we have on the pitch , the second half was a disaster			0
you can not let a team back into the game like that when you have the quality of @entity8			2
" it is something that we have to talk about in the dressing room			0
it has happened twice that being in front has changed the attitude out on the field , and that is not good			0
" @entity8 had started so well , with @entity1 waltzing down the left and firing in a low shot for a third - minute opener			2
@entity30 had a good penalty appeal turned down and a goal disallowed before @entity8 's marquee signing @entity5 laid on a perfect cross for @entity69 to head the second just after half an hour , having been set free by @entity71			2
@entity71 , making his first start this season , was a major factor in @entity8 's first - half dominance but the @entity77 midfielder did not come back out after the break due to another fitness problem which puts him in doubt for tuesday 's trip to @entity82			1
nonetheless , @entity5 was again the provider as @entity1 punished @entity30 at the near post soon after the interval , putting the @entity87 captain above @entity89 's @entity88 in the @entity90 with his 13th league goal this season			0
it was downhill from there for @entity8			0
vallecano won two penalties in quick succession -- both converted by @entity99 , one coming after @entity100 hit the bar -- while @entity102 did well to tip @entity104 's shot onto the post			0
the result left third - placed real six points behind @entity107 -- which won 1 - 0 against @entity108 on friday -- and two behind @entity89 , which hosts @entity110 on sunday			1
@entity111 moved up to seventh with a 5 - 0 drubbing of @entity113 , while @entity114 climbed off the bottom on goal difference with a 1 - 0 win over @entity118			1
@entity119 moved away from the bottom three with a 1 - 0 win at @entity37 -- which had conceded seven against @entity8 in midweek			1
in @entity82 , @entity121 and @entity27 moved to within two points of @entity125 leader @entity123 with respective victories on saturday			1
second - placed @entity121 , which hosts @entity127 in the @entity28 on wednesday , beat @entity128 2 - 1 with first - half goals from former @entity8 forward @entity130 and @entity132 @entity131 -- putting both on six in the league this season			2
@entity27 , which needs to beat @entity8 to have any chance of a place in the knockout stage , triumphed 1 - 0 at @entity139 thanks to a 77th - minute strike from midfielder @entity141			1
struggling @entity142 lost 2 - 0 at home to fourth - placed @entity144 ahead of wednesday 's trip to @entity107 in @entity147 's top club competition , further progress in which may be the key to the future of under - pressure coach @entity151			1
his @entity142 hold the second qualifying place above @entity155 side @entity154 , but languish 11th in @entity125 -- 18 points behind pacesetting @entity123 , which will seek an unprecedented 11th successive win at @entity158 on sunday .			2

@entity8 struggles to 3 - 2 win over @entity77 's bottom team @entity30
@entity9 's team had to hang on nervously after leading by three goals
win leaves third - placed real six points behind @entity20 champion @entity107
wednesday 's *opponent* @entity27 wins 1 - 0 at @entity139 in @entity82 's @entity125
