-- @entity1 has worked with victims of disturbing voyeuristic trends such as " upskirting " and " downblousing			1
" one woman showered for years in a swimsuit after a peeping incident involving her landlord , @entity6 said			1
others stopped wearing skirts entirely			1
" victims say people do n't understand the impact of this crime , " said @entity6 , a policy expert at the @entity15 - based @entity14			1
" it feels like a combination of a kind a sexual assault and stalking			1
" the subject of modern - day peeping @entity27 made national headlines this week when @entity30 ' highest court ruled that a man who snapped cell phone photos up the skirt of women on the @entity36 subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude , as stipulated by a state law against secretive photography			1
the controversial decision overruled a lower court that upheld charges against @entity44 , who was arrested in august 2010 , after police set up a sting following reports that he was using his cell phone to take " upskirt " photos and videos of women without their knowledge			1
" a female passenger on a @entity58 ( @entity58 ) trolley who is wearing a skirt , dress , or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is ' partially nude , ' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing , " wrote justice @entity53 of the state @entity54			1
in @entity30 , prosecutors and state lawmakers called for a revision of the law			1
after state house speaker @entity73 said the legislature would seek to close the loophole in the law quickly , the @entity76 and state senate on thursday passed a bill making " upskirting " illegal , with the measure going to the governor for signing			1
armed with smartphones , @entity84 or other high - tech gadgetry , peeping @entity27 are snapping pictures of unsuspecting women in public places and sharing the images on the @entity90			1
keyword searches on web browsers and social media sites such as @entity94 and @entity95 turn up multiple hits for " upskirting " and " downblousing " sites displaying surreptitious images of women 's private body areas			1
" there 's an epidemic around street harassment broadly , but also we 've received tons of ' upskirt ' reports as well , " said @entity102 , executive director of @entity103 , a web site that encourages women to share their stories and cell phone photographs of harassers and peeping @entity27			1
" i think there 's a fear among people that you could have an ' upskirt ' photo taken of you and never realize it			2
your crotch could be on the @entity122 and you may never know about it			2
" @entity6 said some states have taken steps to deal with high - tech peeping , but many others have failed to update antiquated voyeurism laws that are on the books			1
in @entity133 , for instance , video voyeurism is a felony			2
@entity135 changed its law to add language noting that people have an expectation of privacy in public as well as private spaces			2
@entity6 said states such as @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 have not updated laws to make the distribution of such images or videos on the @entity90 a crime			2
in 2004 , @entity155 passed a federal law making it a crime to photograph people 's " private area ( s ) " on federal properties , including national parks and military bases or to broadcast such images			2
but states are responsible for making high - tech peeping a crime elsewhere			1
" we do n't know how many ( incidents ) happen and victims do n't know about it , " @entity6 said			1
" but when the cases do come , i think that we need laws that cover them			2
what we know about these cases is , it 's not only one picture taken for somebody 's personal gratification			2
but other times people are taking the pictures and putting them on the @entity122 and they 're going even international			2
it 's not just one instance of victimization , it 's many			2
" @entity186 , a professor of political science at the @entity188 whose specialty is gender , privacy and politics , said that stricter " upskirting " laws could make the practice more tantalizing to voyeurs			1
" it 's only because it 's creepy that people do this , " she said			0
" you could see obviously a lot more of women 's bodies in other places			0
' @entity205 ' does n't really reveal much of women 's bodies			0
you could see way more on the internet if you just wanted to			0
" she added , " i think the only thrill is the surreptitiousness of it			0
she 's sort of turned into , like , this passive object			0
" @entity186 said that snapping pictures of perpetrators and making them public is more of a deterrent			0
" that 's much more effective , " she said			0
" the picture takers do n't want to be outed			0
" when @entity186 lived in @entity222 , she said , men exposed themselves to her on two occasions			0
" the way i got back was i did n't react , " she said			0
" i said , ' oh , hello , ' as if there was nothing going on			0
he wanted me to be shocked			0
i think the picture taking is the same sort of defense			0
you 're going against the expectations of the perpetrator			0
" but may said the hollaback ! site -- backed by activists in 71 cities and 24 countries -- is not about revenge			0
in fact , the group prefers educating harassers than penalizing them , she said : " we 're really trying to bring awareness			0
" still , may said there is value in the digital stories and pictures from victims			1
" what 's amazing about it is your ability to turn the lens on them right when you 're being harassed , " she said			0
" it 's certainly a very empowering thing			0
