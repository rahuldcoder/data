as the hours count down to $ 85 billion in government - wide spending cuts , there 's one transportation service that wo n't be derailed -- @entity4			1
officials of the nation 's only long - haul passenger railroad say there will be no cutbacks or changes in its schedule , especially on its popular @entity14 route between @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
that 's much different than the scenario facing @entity21 airlines , which may be forced to alter schedules if federally run air traffic control services are disrupted by spending cuts due to take effect on friday			1
just how is @entity4 able to absorb a hit from the so - called budget sequester ? part of the answer lies in its charter as a for - profit government corporation , which allows it to operate like a business and charge fares and fees			1
" @entity4 is planning to take actions to allow it to withstand a funding cut and not cut service			2
during ( fiscal year ) 2013 , @entity4 is experiencing solid revenue growth and we have been controlling our costs and managing our budget in anticipation of a possible reduction in federal funding , " said @entity38 , an @entity4 spokeswoman			1
congressmen leave as spending cuts loom however , she acknowledged that the " continued lack of predictable federal appropriations makes proper budgeting and future planning extremely difficult			2
" rail service has been a priority for the @entity57 administration			0
while in the @entity59 , vice president @entity58 commuted for years to his home in @entity61 on @entity4 and is one of its biggest supporters			2
the railroad has instituted a number of business reforms over the years , some of them under pressure from @entity70 , lowered debt , and has been able to make infrastructure improvements to boost operating efficiency			1
@entity4 carried more than 31 million passengers last year and covers most of its operating costs from passenger revenue			1
why @entity15 ca n't cut wasteful spending but it also receives taxpayer help each year			1
in fiscal year 2012 , @entity4 was approved to receive an operating subsidy of $ 466 million			1
the remainder of government help for capital improvements and debt service was estimated at $ 950 million			1
if @entity4 is going to continue to stay on track , it will have to rely on its money - making short haul routes , where it competes with airlines			2
nearly 90 percent of the rail service 's ridership since 1997 has been on trips under 400 miles			0
along with a 55 percent jump in passengers , it generated a positive operating surplus of $ 47 million in 2011 , according to a new report released by the @entity97			0

these ridership numbers include our long - distance train passengers , " @entity117 , @entity4 spokesman , said in an e-mailed statement			2

what you need to know about spending cuts the report on rail travel trends found ridership on long distance routes carry less than 20 percent of system riders and contributed a drag to @entity4 's bottom line to the tune of $ 614 million			1
" we appreciate their suggestion to allow states the flexibility to use their federal surface transportation dollars for rail investments			0
with regard to how long - distance trains are funded , @entity70 has determined that these services are vital and a necessary part of @entity21 's national transportation system and economy , " @entity117 said			0
@entity151 , a @entity97 senior fellow and co-author of the report , said that @entity4 is " too often considered a big , bloated bureaucracy that depends heavily on federal subsidies and is no longer relevant to the technologically oriented metropolitan economies of today			1
