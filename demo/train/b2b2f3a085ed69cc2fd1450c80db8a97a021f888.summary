-- a friend said monday that " something happened " to the man police accused of killing four homeless people in @entity6 , after he came back from serving in the @entity8 military in @entity9			1
" he was a little bit more serious , it seemed like there was something on his mind , " @entity10 , who lived a few doors down from @entity12 and asked to be identified only by his first name , told @entity0			2
" he seemed really depressed and down , and things in his life were n't looking that well			2
" the 23 - year - old @entity12 was arrested friday night after he allegedly stabbed a transient to death in @entity27 , @entity24 sgt. @entity23 said sunday			1
the suspect has not been arraigned in relation to that or the three other killings , and police have not detailed evidence behind their accusation			2
his father , @entity35 , who lost his home in 2008 and now lives in the cab of a semi-trailer parked in @entity39 , @entity6 , said it was hard to believe his son could be involved in the killings			1
" i saw him so many times giving the last money he had in his pocket ... to the homeless , to the people that ( are ) asking for some help			0
... my son 's always been a role model , " @entity12 said in a video interview posted on the @entity51 's website			1
@entity12 , 50 , told the @entity51 that his son , worried about his father 's safety , had recently pointed out an @entity56 warning about homeless men being killed in the area			1
@entity35 said his son was a @entity59 in @entity9 , and returned a changed man			2
he started talking about things that " did n't make any sense , " like the @entity63			0
@entity8 military officials did n't immediately respond monday to @entity0 requests for information about @entity12 's military service			1
" they killed the person he was , " he told the @entity51			0
" and that 's the only possibility i can think of that he would do something like that			0
" @entity10 , the neighbor , described @entity12 as a " fun , ... ordinary kid " when they grew up together in southern @entity6 , adding " he was really looking forward to the service " after graduating from high school			1
" when you were around him , you had fun , " the suspect 's high school classmate said			1
but like @entity12 's father , @entity10 said he noticed some recent changes in the young man , including when the two met up a few times last summer			1
" i knew he wanted to see ( combat ) action , and i knew he enjoyed it , " said @entity10 , noting he 'd lent his friend a self - help book			2
" then something happened , and i just do n't know what			0
" @entity10 added that he had a hard time reckoning that his friend possibly could be responsible for the killings			0
" i would never have guessed this , " he said			0
