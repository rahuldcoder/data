-- on the afternoon of august 3 , a graying , slightly paunchy , well - dressed man in a mask and carrying a baseball bat strolled into the bedroom of an 18 - year - old @entity7 woman studying for a school exam			1
he strapped something that seemed to be a bomb to her neck and told her not to move			1
with that , a man police now identify as @entity17 , 50 , touched off a baffling international investigation that eventually reached 9,317 miles across the ocean to @entity20 , @entity21 , where an @entity23 team arrested @entity17 on monday			1
authorities say @entity17 attempted to extort money from @entity17 's family in suburban @entity28 by fastening a black box around her neck that he said in a note contained " powerful new technology plastic explosives " that would go off if she did not follow his instructions , according to a complaint for provisional arrest filed tuesday in @entity37 in @entity38			1
those instructions included orders to write to an e-mail address and wait for details on handing over an unspecified amount of money			1
@entity17 spent nearly 10 agonizing hours in her bedroom as authorities tested the box to make sure it would not explode before removing it from her neck			2
at the same time , authorities allege , @entity17 was stopping off in his four - wheel - drive @entity50 at a library and video store to check the e-mail account he 'd given @entity17 and whiling away at least part of the time at a liquor store browsing for wine , a @entity58 to be precise			1
@entity17 ' attorney , @entity59 , said the investment banker and attorney will contest the charges			2
" it is my understanding that he has no criminal history whatsoever , " @entity59 added			2
" we are enormously relieved that an arrest has been made , " father @entity67 said			2
" these past two weeks have been a very difficult time for us			2
" on wednesday , @entity17 told reporters the incident was " all very surreal			1
" " i 'm glad it 's all over , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity73 in @entity7			1
investigators in @entity7 and the @entity76 say they were able to link @entity17 to the e-mail address using video surveillance and access logs , and found credit card records showing that he had purchased a thumb drive , lanyard and baseball bat identical to those used in the extortion attempt , according to the complaint			1
a magistrate in @entity21 ordered @entity17 , an @entity7 national , held without bail until at least october 14 , when he may be allowed to apply for bail			1
that 's also when @entity7 will be required to request @entity17 ' extradition			1
@entity59 told @entity0 that the proceedings may include a probable cause hearing			0
@entity7 police plan to seek charges against him including kidnapping , aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious indictable offense , and demanding property by force with intent to steal , according to the complaint			1
@entity17 is not accused of any @entity76 offenses			0
assistant commissioner @entity106 of the @entity107 said @entity17 was not yet a suspect when he flew to @entity38 on august 8 , arriving the next day			2
but " a fairly detailed chain of circumstantial evidence " -- including @entity17 's detailed description of the " heavily disguised " assailant -- ultimately led them to the @entity76 and the arrest			0
according to the complaint , a man wearing a business shirt , slacks and a blue , yellow and white mask that covered everything but his mouth and a pair of " saggy and wrinkly " eyes sauntered into @entity17 's room , carrying a backpack and a black aluminum baseball bat			0
he said he was n't going to hurt her , forced a black box around her neck using something like a bike chain and locked it			0
to this he added a lanyard with a green thumb drive and a plastic document sleeve containing a note			2
" count to 200 , " the man said , according to the complaint			0
" i 'll be back			0
" @entity17 waited a few minutes , called out to the man but got no response			0
she contacted her parents and asked for police , and after a tense nine or 10 hours , tests concluded that the device was not a bomb			1
@entity7 and @entity76 authorities say the e-mail account listed in the note was created may 30 at a computer using an internet address assigned to the @entity154 airport , where travel documents indicate @entity17 was on that day			1
investigators say video surveillance linked him to the only three logins to the account , all in the hours after the break - in at the @entity17 home			1
surveillance cameras at a library in @entity165 , @entity7 , showed him pulling up in a silver @entity50 and leaving moments after the first login			1
the next two came at a video store in @entity170 , @entity7			1
surveillance cameras from a liquor store next to the video shop showed a man resembling @entity17 entering the store on two separate occasions that evening , each shortly before the e-mail account was accessed			0
@entity17 apparently spent part of this afternoon waiting for a response by shopping for @entity181 wine , according to a liquor store employee who police said remembered talking to @entity17			2
the man , the store clerk said , appeared to be just " wasting time , " according to the complaint			0
investigators say credit card receipts indicated that @entity17 bought the thumb drive , lanyard and baseball bat used in the incident in the weeks leading up to it , as well as a deleted file on the thumb drive that forensic analysis showed was created on a computer called " @entity197 " authorities in @entity7 alerted their @entity76 counterparts to @entity17 after finding travel records showing that he had flown to @entity38 on august 8 and had previously wired money to a woman living in @entity203 , @entity21 , who turns out to be his former wife			1
the @entity23 sent an agent to check out the house two days later and spotted @entity17 in the backyard			0
" i do n't think he resisted in any respect , " @entity59 said			0
authorities do not believe his ex-wife was involved in or aware of the plot			0
the couple divorced in 2007 , according to @entity59			0
@entity17 is a globe - trotting investment banker who went to primary school in @entity216 , attended college in @entity28 , ran investments in @entity219 and spent quite a bit of time in the @entity76 , where his ex-wife and three school - age children live , according to authorities and his attorney			2
a woman who identified herself as his hairdresser was quoted by the @entity228 newspaper in @entity7 as saying he was a " happy - go - lucky chap			1
" " i was actually really shocked , you know , i could n't believe it because he was such a nice fella , " the newspaper quoted @entity229 as saying			0
how he ended up in the wealthy @entity28 suburb of @entity233 , where many athletes and celebrities live , allegedly attempting to extort money from the @entity237 remains something of a mystery			2
an @entity7 police official who accompanied @entity23 agents on the raid in @entity243 said the @entity244 did n't know @entity17			1
but it appears he was formerly employed by a company with which the @entity237 have links , according to the complaint filed in federal court			0
the complaint did n't elaborate , and the nature of the specific link was n't immediately clear tuesday			0
a @entity254 profile that appears to be @entity17 ' lists his job as managing director at @entity258 , formerly @entity259			0
no web listing for such a company could be immediately located			0
@entity17 was formerly the @entity76 managing director at @entity262 , according to the profile			0
@entity0 's @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
