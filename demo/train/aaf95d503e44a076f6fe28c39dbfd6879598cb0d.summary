@entity0 , @entity1 -- attorneys supporting the voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage in @entity1 filed a notice of appeal in the case thursday , one day after a federal judge ruled that the measure is unconstitutional			1
however , chief u.s district judge @entity11 in @entity0 granted a temporary stay along with his ruling wednesday , which stops his decision from taking immediate effect			2
" @entity16 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license			0
indeed , the evidence shows @entity16 does nothing more than enshrine in the @entity27 the notion that opposite - sex couples are superior to same - sex couples , " @entity11 , who was appointed to the federal bench by former president @entity23 , wrote in his opinion			1
supporters of @entity16 argued , prior to @entity11 's ruling , that same - sex marriages would be performed soon after his decision and could be complicated by rulings and appeals farther down the legal road			1
the judge 's decision striking down the ban handed supporters of gay rights a major victory in a case that both sides say is sure to wind up before the @entity46 @entity45			1
the case will be appealed to the 9th @entity48			0
@entity49 , a former @entity50 prosecutor and criminal defense attorney , said he believes @entity11 's decision is likely to be upheld there , saying the appeals court " is a very liberal court which is favorable on these issues			2
" @entity11 's 136 - page decision does a good job in laying out a compelling case for the unconstitutionality of the proposition , @entity49 said			1
" he 's looking ... to the appellate process , which is going all the way to the @entity45			1
" but , he said , the nation 's highest court typically handles big social questions like this one slowly , allowing state and lower federal courts to issue decisions			2
" and they kind of let it percolate in the lower courts , " @entity49 said			0
opponents of same - sex marriage have said their best bet lies with higher courts			1
" the court 's disregard for the historical purposes of marriage would require @entity1 to embark on a novel experiment with the fundamental institution of marriage , " said @entity77 , lead counsel for @entity16 supporters , in a statement			1
he said @entity11 's decision treats children as a " mere afterthought when it comes to marriage ... and the court also found that there is no benefit whatsoever for a child to be raised by its own biological parents			1
" fortunately , the @entity96 does not require the people to substitute the social science musings of gay rights activists for common sense , " @entity77 said			0
" this decision will not stand			0
" @entity49 said he does n't expect the @entity45 to enter the fray immediately			2
" i think it 's probably going to be another couple of years			0
a lot of cases will be decided by the lower courts , and then they 'll move in and make the big decision as to whether it 's legal or not , gay marriage , " he said			1
the proposition defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman			0
at stake in the trial was whether the ban violates same - sex couples ' rights to equal protection and due process , as protected by the @entity46 @entity96			1
same - sex marriage is currently legal in five @entity46 states -- @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 -- and in the @entity130 , while civil unions are permitted in @entity132			1
@entity11 pointed out in his ruling , " race restrictions on marital partners were once common in most states but are now seen as archaic , shameful or even bizarre			0
gender no longer forms an essential part of marriage ; marriage under law is a union of equals			0
" elated supporters of same - sex marriage gathered to celebrate the judge 's opinion in the @entity149 district of @entity0			1
after speeches and songs , they began a march to @entity153			0
people waved rainbow flags and @entity46 flags , and carried signs that read , " we all deserve the freedom to marry , " and " separate is unequal			2
" similar rallies unfolded in cities across @entity1 -- including @entity162 and @entity163			2
" for our entire lives , our government and the law have treated us as unequal			0
this decision to ensure that our constitutional rights are as protected as everyone else 's makes us incredibly proud of our country , " said @entity167 , a plaintiff in the case along with @entity170			1
@entity175 and @entity176 are the other couple at the heart of the case			0
many @entity46 , however , still oppose same - sex marriage			1
in a national survey , conducted by @entity183 in may , 53 percent of respondents said such marriages should not be recognized by law , while 44 percent said they should			0
proposition 8 is part of a long line of seesaw rulings , court cases , debates and protests over the controversial issue			0
it passed in @entity1 with some 52 percent of the vote in november 2008			2
" big surprise ! we expected nothing different from judge @entity11 , after the biased way he conducted this trial , " said @entity198 , president of the @entity199			0
" with a stroke of his pen , judge @entity11 has overruled the votes and values of 7 million californians who voted for marriage as one man and one woman			0

new : a notice of appeal has been filed in the case
a @entity1 judge ruled the state 's ban on same - sex marriage is unconstitutional
the decision is a major victory for *proponents* of same - sex marriage
the case is expected to *ultimately* land at the @entity46 @entity45
