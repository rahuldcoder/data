-- @entity1 marked @entity3 's final match in charge with a 3 - 0 win over @entity6 to win the @entity7 friday			1
it was the 14th trophy of @entity3 's remarkable reign at the @entity11 giants which began at the start of the 2008/09 season when he succeeded @entity14			1
to honor their departing coach , @entity1 turned on the style in the @entity17 in @entity18 and the match was effectively over inside the first 25 minutes as @entity20 with a double and @entity22 scored to put them 3 - 0 ahead			1
the emphatic victory will be consolation in part for shattering defeats to eventual winners @entity28 in the semifinal of the @entity30 and the concession of their @entity33 title to arch - rivals @entity18			0
after the @entity28 reverse , the 41 - year - old @entity3 announced he would be leaving at the end of the season , bringing to a close a 23 - year association with the club as a player and coach			0
@entity3 cited tiredness and the need to take a break as reasons for his departure , but he has been linked with a number of vacant managerial vacancies , including @entity28			0
his assistant @entity51 will take charge of @entity1 next season			0
they shared the dugout for the final time as @entity1 rounded off their season and afterwards @entity3 said he left with a special sense of accomplishment			2
" fourteen titles in four years is a very high standard so i am very happy to leave the club in a good position , and tonight we played great for the first 35 minutes , we 've had a good year with four titles so i leave very satisfied , " he told gathered reporters			0
" from ( @entity22 ) @entity22 i have learned to be even more competitive than i ever was , without him we would not have won the number of titles we have and i 'm very privileged to have coached who for me is the best player i have ever seen			0
" @entity1 's 2011/12 campaign had begun in the usual all - conquering fashion for @entity3 and his men as they collected the @entity75 , beating @entity18 , the @entity76 and their second @entity77			1
but @entity18 took advantage of rare slips by the three - time reigning champions to forge clear in @entity33 , the title sealed by a 2 - 1 win at the @entity83 last month			2
a 2 - 2 home draw to @entity28 , losing 3 - 2 on aggregate , prompted @entity3 's shock departure and left the @entity7 as their only remaining target			1
@entity88 's @entity6 were expected to offer stiffer resistance but defeat to @entity91 in the @entity93 final and disappointing late season form in @entity33 was reflected in their performance			0
@entity20 , who has endured a mediocre season , thumped home the first after three minutes and @entity22 made it 2 - 0 with his 73rd goal of the season for @entity1 soon afterwards			1
@entity20 's low strike on 25 minutes settled all doubt about the eventual outcome although @entity105 looked to have a strong penalty claim when pulled down by @entity107			0
@entity6 had the better chances after the break but @entity1 's stars coasted to their third victory in @entity113 's domestic cup competition in four years to provide a fitting finale for @entity3			1
editors note : read @entity117 's feature on @entity118 that asks : did @entity3 reinvent football in his time at @entity1 ?			2
