-- @entity1 , one of @entity4 's largest consumer electronics exhibitions kicked off this week in @entity5			0
with manufacturing giants such as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 all rumored to be launching new products at the show , @entity0 asked @entity12 , online editor at @entity13 , to select five of his favorite gadgets from the exhibition floor			0
@entity16 @entity8 's new flagship smartphone features an amazing @entity19 camera , plus an even tougher and more water - resistant frame than its predecessor the @entity22 inside , the @entity16 has a more powerful quad - core processor and a whopping @entity25 battery -- and with a razor - sharp 5in full hd screen , it 's shaping up to be yet another top class @entity28 phone			1
@entity13 's @entity30 says : " although it 's not a comprehensive overhaul of @entity8 's flagship phone , the @entity16 does offer several incremental improvements			1
" read more : @entity16 review @entity36 - @entity35 @entity36 has managed a world first with this 4k - compatible tablet , which features an incredibly sharp 3840 x 2560 pixel screen			1
at 20 inches in size , it 's around four times bigger than an @entity41 and manages only two hours of battery life , so portable it is n't -- but this @entity45 8 - powered beast is certainly something to behold			1
do n't expect to spot many in the wild though -- the â ‚ ¬ 4,500 price tag will be hard for even the most ardent early adopter to stomach			0
@entity52 and @entity53 @entity7 put on a huge press conference to announce a handful of new products , but the @entity58 giant is clearly banking on them being blockbuster hits			0
the @entity53 is the third - generation of the note " phablet " ( bigger than a smartphone , smaller than a tablet )			2
with a 1920 x 1080 5.7in screen , eight - core processor , @entity68 camera with 3x optical zoom and a swanky stitched leather back panel , it 's looking set to be one of the most powerful , versatile mobile devices on the market			2
read more : @entity53 review the @entity52 is something entirely new for @entity7			0
it 's an @entity28 - powered smartwatch that maintains a link to your @entity79 phone to deliver notifications , control music playback and access apps			2
read more : @entity52 review @entity85 a 3d printer that you hold in your hand like a pen , the @entity86 - funded @entity85 is undoubtedly one of the coolest breakout oddities of @entity1 2013			1
the size of a @entity96 cigar , it extrudes hot , quick - setting plastic from its nozzle nib , allowing you to " sketch " out small 3d models in minutes			1
it 's much faster than using a traditional 3d printer -- and does n't require any software to boot			0
