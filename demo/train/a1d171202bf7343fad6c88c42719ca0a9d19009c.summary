@entity0 -- thousands of confidential files on the @entity5 military 's most technologically advanced fighter aircraft have been compromised by unknown computer hackers over the past two years , according to senior defense officials			1
the @entity10 's self - diagnostic system was compromised by hackers , officials say			1
the internet intruders were able to gain access to data related to the design and electronics systems of the @entity10 through computers of @entity19 contractors in charge of designing and building the aircraft , according to the officials , who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue			1
in addition to files relating to the aircraft , hackers gained entry into the @entity29 's air traffic control systems , according to the officials			1
once they got in , the @entity32 hackers were able to see such information as the locations of @entity5 military aircraft in flight			1
the joint striker fighter plane is the military 's new @entity10 ii. it designed to become the aircraft used by all of the branches of service			1
most of the files broken into focused on the design and performance statistics of the fighter , as well as its electronic systems , officials said			1
the information could be used to make the plane easier to fight or defend against			2
additionally , the system used by the aircraft to conduct self - diagnostics during flight was compromised by the computer intrusions , according to the officials			2
however , the officials insisted that none of the information accessed was highly sensitive data			1
the plane uses stealth and other highly sensitive electronic equipment , but it does not appear that information on those systems was compromised , because it is stored on computers that are not connected to the @entity32 , according to the defense officials			1
the @entity10 's main contractor is @entity70 , and @entity71 and @entity72 are major subcontractors in the plane 's production			1
@entity70 's chief financial officer denied that there was any breach of classified information , which was first reported by the @entity79 on tuesday			1
" the @entity5 government does n't talk a whole lot about this , and neither do we			0
but in response to the [ @entity79 ] report , we think it 's incorrect , " said @entity84 of @entity70			2
" there 's never been any effective attack			0
we have measures in place , and there 's never been a successful attack			0
" in a statement released later , the company reiterated its position that no classified information had been accessed			1
" to our knowledge , there has never been any classified information breach			1
like the government , we have attacks on our systems continually and have stringent measures in place to detect and stop attacks , " the statement said			0
representatives of @entity72 and @entity71 would not comment on the story and referred all questions to @entity70			0
different variations of the @entity10 will be produced for the different branches of service it will be used in			1
many international partners are helping build the plane , and it will be sold to @entity5 - allied countries			0
the involvement of multiple nations raises concern about the level of computer security measures the partner countries have , officials said			0
companies contracting with the @entity19 now have to prove that they are using the proper computer security before a contract can be awarded , @entity19 officials said			0
that measure was put into place within the past year because of the increase in cyber intrusions , they said			0
asked whether sensitive technology for the @entity10 had been jeopardized , @entity19 spokesman @entity133 said , " i am not aware of any specific concerns			1
" @entity133 would not confirm the cyber-security breach on the @entity137 but said the number of attempted attacks on the @entity5 military 's network has been on the rise			2
" we have seen the number of intrusion attempts more than double recently , " he said			0
he would not reveal a timeline			0
he said the computer systems of the @entity19 are scanned thousands of times a day by entities looking for ways inside @entity5 military computer networks			2
officials could not say who was behind the computer hacking , which has occurred numerous times since 2007			0
the intruders were able to cover their tracks , making it look like the virtual break - ins were coming from various parts of the world , according to officials			2
the @entity79 reported that the attacks appeared to originate in @entity164 , citing " former @entity5 officials			0
" last month , a @entity19 annual report to @entity167 about @entity164 's military power said @entity164 has been making continued progress in developing cyber-warfare techniques			2
the report noted that @entity5 government computers were the target of " intrusions that appear to have originated " in @entity164 , although they were not confirmed to be from the @entity164 military			2
@entity1 requested a comment about the accusation from the @entity178 in @entity0			0
an embassy spokesman denied the allegations to the @entity79			0
the @entity29 , the main program manager of the @entity137 , has a number of ongoing investigations into the multiple hackings , officials said			1
the officials said that a number of safeguards have since been put into place to protect that system			0
@entity1 's @entity191 contributed to this report .			0

intruders got access to @entity10 info through contractor computers
hackers also gained entry to @entity29 's air traffic control systems
officials insist that no highly classified information was taken
@entity10 *jet* is designed to be used by all branches of military
