@entity0 , @entity1 -- four months after he built a new , two - story brick house in his village in northern @entity1 's @entity6 , @entity3 was alarmed to find a huge crack on the living room wall			1
having seen homes in neighboring villages sink , @entity3 realized his long - held fears were coming true			1
" i knew the day was coming , but i did n't expect it to happen so soon , " said @entity3 , who has been forced to move from the land -- on which four generations of his family have lived -- as a consequence			1
@entity3 's hometown , @entity0 , is one of @entity1 's " coal cities , " whose mineral wealth helps light up the night skies of the world 's most energy - hungry country			1
the land here is honeycombed with coal mines , which can form massive sinkholes that leave thousands of homes uninhabitable every year			1
ten years ago , the area where @entity3 lived was a vibrant farming community on the @entity33			1
but sinkholes are devouring 20 million square meters ( 7.7 square miles ) of land here a year , according to the @entity36 , and have displaced an estimated 100,000 people , mostly farmers and their families , over the past decade			1
by 2090 , the bureau predicts one third of the city -- an area as large as @entity43 -- will fall into the earth , and an estimated 5 million people will have been forced out of the region by the problem			1
those figures worry government - affiliated sinkhole researcher @entity49 , who said tensions over migration may lead to social unrest			0
" schools in some districts are overwhelmed with migrant students , while in other districts , classrooms are half empty , " she told @entity2			0
sinkholes : common , costly and sometimes deadly in this low - lying area , most sinkholes quickly fill with water			1
" i am afraid the city is turning into the @entity65 , " former mayor @entity62 told the @entity63 , a local newspaper , earlier this year			1
when coal was discovered in the region in the 1960s , it proved a boon for the local economy			1
state - run miner @entity72 grew from a local coal company to a multination - listed energy giant , employing about one of every two workers in town			1
@entity78 , a coal company employee , remembers the city as an underdeveloped backwater thirty years ago			1
" when i was young , the town did not have a single factory , shopping mall or train station , " he said			0
" now we are one of the most affluent regions in @entity1			1
" but that prosperity has come at a price			0
each day , @entity78 passes hundreds of sinkholes on his way to work			2
like many urban residents , he believes it is too late for the city to withdraw from the lucrative coal business			2
" we are nothing without the coal company , " he said			2
" all we can do is keep mining and fixing the sinkholes			2
" in recent years , local officials tried several creative solutions for the sinkhole crisis , transforming the gaping holes into water theme parks , fishing ponds and lakes			2
one has been turned into a wetland park , a major spot for bird watching in the northern part of the city ; another is now a fish breeding pond powered by solar panels			0
but more than 50 % of the subsided land remains abandoned , often polluted and emitting a pungent aroma			2
" the fund from central government for fixing sinkholes can barely cover expenses , " government official @entity116 told @entity2			2
while @entity1 's @entity122 gives clear guidance for how much a coal company should pay displaced residents for damages , it fails to take into account the problems that follow , @entity116 said			1
" the sinkhole issue is more complicated than removing a village and refilling the sinkholes , " said another local official , who asked his name not be used because of the sensitive nature of the issue			2
" many deep sinkholes have been sinking for over 10 years			2
you do n't know the right time to treat them			0
also communities removed from the subsidence area still need government support after moving to a new place			0
" but government - affiliated researcher @entity49 claims the government has done a poor job addressing the problem			0
" local government would not consider filling sinkholes , " @entity49 said			2
if you can easily turn a flooded subsidence into a water theme park , would you take pains to reclaim the land ? " some farmers have attempted to fill the holes themselves -- only to find the cost is too high			0
it costs at least us $ 15 per square meter to drain a hole and put in new soil			0
but according to @entity3 , villagers only get compensated to the tune of @entity165 $ 5 per square meter from the coal company			1
the @entity168 declined @entity2 requests for comment , citing the sensitivity of mining - induced farmland losses and migration issues			0
for @entity3 , the move to his new home has hit the family 's dinner table as they can no longer raise their own pigs or grow their own vegetables			1
" the pork price is rising and we can not afford it			0
having fresh vegetables and meat had never been a problem before because we grew and bred what we wanted to eat , " @entity3 said			1
another villager points out the lack of jobs in the new location			0
" our new home is 20 miles ( 32.1 kilometers ) from the nearest town			0
it is hard for us find a decent job , " said @entity195 , who operates a street noodle stand			0
" young people flock to bigger cities , looking for factory jobs			0
those who stayed are doing small businesses like operating noodle restaurants , " @entity3 said			1
" but for the next generation , nobody will know how to farm			0
" the 50 - year old gets emotional when talking about his old village			0
" as i get older , my nostalgic feeling for the old village grows stronger			0
i try not to think about it -- about the fact that it is a lake and the village only lives in my memory			0

when cracks appeared in @entity3 's house he feared the worse
@entity3 's hometown , @entity0 , is one of @entity1 's massive " coal cities "
he watched many of his neighbors ' homes sink into the ground
