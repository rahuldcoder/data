it 's only going to get worse unless you give us more money , administration officials warned thursday about the flood of @entity7 children illegally entering the @entity8 from @entity9			2
homeland security secretary @entity10 told the @entity11 that $ 3.7 billion in emergency funding requested by president @entity13 anticipated up to 90,000 of the unaccompanied minors this fiscal year , which ends september 30 , and another 145,000 in fiscal year 2015			1
so far , the 57,000 who crossed the @entity18 border in the past nine months have overwhelmed the immigration system , causing overcrowded holding facilities and a huge backlog of cases awaiting hearings that can take years to schedule			1
" doing nothing is not an option , " @entity10 said , noting the increased demand for his department 's services would cause @entity27 to run out of money next month while @entity29 would burn through its annual funding by mid-september			0
emergency funding the emergency money sought by the president would hire more border patrol officers , judges and others to deal with the unprecedented influx from @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 while providing more detention facilities and other resources -- all designed to speed up the processing of the child immigrants			1
however , the deep partisan divide over the immigration issue set up a certain congressional battle over the funding			0
earlier thursday , house speaker @entity51 erupted in anger over what he called @entity13 's lack of leadership on the issue , telling reporters that " this is a problem of the president 's own making			1
" " he 's been president for five and a half years , " the @entity62 @entity61 thundered			0
" when is he going to take responsibility for something ? " after @entity13 's @entity18 trip , what now for the immigration crisis ? while motivated in part by the rolling tv cameras , @entity51 's outburst also responded to salvos fired at him by @entity13 on a two - day trip to @entity18 -- the epicenter of the immigration influx -- in the endless effort to gain political advantage			1
seeking political advantage on wednesday night , @entity13 told reporters in @entity80 that @entity61 put party gain over progress in resolving what the @entity84 calls an urgent humanitarian situation -- tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors overwhelming the immigration system after illegally entering the @entity8 in recent months			1
" the problem here is not a major disagreement around the actions that could be helpful in dealing with the problem , " he said , but whether @entity97 would " put the resources in place to get this done , " adding : " are folks more interested in politics , or are they more interested in solving the problem ? " @entity18 gov. @entity101 and other @entity61 lashed out at @entity13 , particularly his decision not to tour overcrowded border facilities while in @entity18 to see for himself the human side of the situation			1
" the @entity8 people expect to see their president when there is a disaster , " @entity101 told @entity107 's @entity106 in an interview that aired thursday , citing @entity13 's trip to the @entity110 to tour damage caused by @entity112 in 2012			1
" he showed up at @entity112			0
why not @entity18 ? " @entity18 governor lashes out at @entity13 over immigration crisis ' go down there and see what we 're facing ' even some @entity122 were critical of the decision			1
@entity18 @entity122 rep. @entity124 told @entity107 's " @entity128 " that it 's important for @entity13 to see what the children are going through			1
" i 'm interested in him looking at the kids			0
the kids that i 've talked to , little innocent little boys and girls that have come across and have traveled over 1,000 miles , that a third of the girls have been abused and raped on the way up here , " he said			0
" the last young kid was an 11 - year - old little boy from @entity40 that died of dehydration			0
that is the face that i want him to see			0
do n't take any cameras , mr. president , but go down there and see what we 're facing			2
" @entity13 said wednesday that visiting facilities where the children are processed and detained would be little more than a photo opportunity			2
" there 's nothing that is taking place down there that i am not intimately aware of and briefed on			0
this is a problem , " he said			0
other democrats from states bordering @entity9 questioned @entity13 's handling of the problem , indicating major challenges for the emergency funding sought by the president			1
immigration limbo @entity13 called on @entity97 to quickly approve the $ 3.7 billion in additional money this fiscal year to deal with the crisis , which has left tens of thousands of new undocumented immigrants in a kind of immigration limbo			1
a lot of them surrendered themselves to @entity29 officers on the belief they will be allowed to stay in the country , and officials have struggled to house the children amid a staggering backlog of immigration cases			2
to @entity51 and other @entity61 , @entity13 gets the blame because of his past decision to halt deportations of some young undocumented immigrants			1
" on our southern border , we 've got a true humanitarian crisis underway with children caught in the middle , " @entity51 said , adding that @entity13 's actions " gave false hope to children and their families ( that ) if they entered the country illegally , they would be allowed to stay			1
" criticized by @entity13 for preventing a @entity84 vote on a @entity11 - passed immigration reforms that would provide a path to legal status for millions of undocumented people living in @entity8 , @entity51 said he wanted the @entity84 to take up legislation addressing the current influx before it goes on recessin august			1
however , he made clear @entity13 's emergency funding plan would get serious scrutiny , saying : " we are not giving the president a blank check			1
" is the immigration crisis @entity101 's second act ? process overwhelmed @entity13 administration officials blame the influx on dire conditions in @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , the three countries of origin for most of the new child immigrants			1
they note that people from other countries do n't join the influx , saying that showed it involves those fleeing bad conditions in the three @entity7 nations			0
to @entity51 , @entity101 and other @entity61 , the administration invited the problem			2
" the children are a symptom of policies that have enticed them to come , " he said			0
" the first thing you have to do is stop the flow , because if we do n't , then the problem 's not going to be the size we have today			0
" @entity61 have called for the repeal of a 2008 law signed by president @entity235 that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from countries that do not border the @entity8			2
" i do n't think we can solve the problem unless we revisit " the law , @entity18 @entity239 sen. @entity239 said			2
" what 's happened is these children are placed with family members in the @entity8 and given a notice to appear for a later court hearing			0
some have called this a notice to disappear , not a notice to appear , " as most do n't show up , he said			0
another @entity239 , sen. @entity250 of @entity251 , said the @entity8 should immediately fly the children back to their home countries			0
it would cost less and signal @entity8 intolerance for those who enter the country illegally , he argued			0
@entity239 and @entity124 planned to introduce legislation thursday to alter the 2008 deportation hearing provision			0
the bill , @entity124 said , will include protections for children who come to the @entity8 because of concerns about drug or sex trafficking			0
@entity122 want to keep the law intact to ensure that children who deserve asylum receive a full hearing			0
funding breakdown @entity13 's emergency funding request seeks $ 1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts as well as crack down on smugglers			1
another $ 300 million would go to help @entity9 and @entity7 governments counter claims by smugglers to desperate parents that @entity8 officials wo n't send their children back			2
" while we intend to do the right thing by these children , their parents need to know that this is an incredibly dangerous situation and it is unlikely that their children will be able to stay , " @entity13 said			2
the request also includes $ 1.8 billion to provide care for unaccompanied children crossing the border			2
overall , it amounts to about 10 % of the $ 30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the immigration reform bill passed by the @entity11 but stalled in the @entity61 - controlled @entity84			1
