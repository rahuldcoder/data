-- world no. 1 @entity1 and 14 - time major winner @entity3 are both accustomed to life on the road , but even the planet 's two top - ranked golfers are not immune to the stresses and strains of the professional golf circuit			1
in an exclusive joint interview with @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 explained how the grueling calendar has forced them both to skip this week 's lucrative $ 7 million @entity15 tournament in @entity16 -- which starts just three days after their " duel at @entity18 " exhibition match			1
@entity1 won that clash a day after finishing second at a tournament in @entity22 on sunday , while @entity3 came straight from playing in @entity23			1
" for me , i 'm fried , " said the 36 - year - old @entity3			1
" i 've played a lot of golf towards the end of the year ... i have one more tournament for the year and then i 'm done until next year			2
" a resurgent @entity3 has recovered from a loss of form and fitness which dates back to november 2009 and the scandal that ended his marriage			1
after dropping out of the top 50 of the world rankings in october 2011 , @entity3 has bounced back in 2012 by winning three @entity35 events and he is second on the @entity38 - based circuit 's money list behind its winner @entity1			1
woods , who has spent a record 623 weeks at the top of the world rankings since turning pro in 1996 , will finish the season by playing at the @entity45 event that he hosts later this month			1
" i looked at it , i wanted a break , " @entity3 explained			2
" i wanted a long extended break from competing and get back into training			0
" it has been a stellar year for @entity1			1
he won the second major title of his career at august 's @entity53 , adding to his 2011 @entity55 triumph , as well as helping @entity56 retain the @entity57 in @entity58 thanks to a stunning comeback victory against a @entity38 team including @entity3			1
but @entity1 , who also leads the @entity64 's " race to @entity63 " money list , is feeling the effects of a long season and is wary of playing too much			1
" someone needs a week off somewhere , " the 23 - year - old said			2
" if i played @entity69 , i would be playing five events in a row to finish the season			0
" after such a busy summer , a @entity57 and everything which has gone on , there has got to be an event somewhere which has to be left out and this year unfortunately it was @entity69 , for the reason that i was n't a fan of the golf course and i needed a week off			1
" @entity1 is one half of sport 's most high - profile love match with @entity84 tennis ace @entity83			1
but despite having a sporting girlfriend -- the couple have been dubbed " @entity87 " -- @entity1 admitted life on the tour can get lonely			2
" you want to have guys you can go out for dinner with and have a laugh with in the locker room , " he added			0
" you 're out there for 25 weeks a year , so you might as well make it fun			2
" the growing rivalry between @entity1 and @entity3 is proving to be a big drawcard for golf , as witnessed by the chaotically enthusiastic scenes in monday 's one - off clash between the pair			1
the confident @entity1 has not been shy in pointing out @entity3 ' fall from his previous apparent invincibility , and the @entity38 compared their relationship to that of previous adversaries @entity109 and @entity110			1
" i talked to @entity109 about it and @entity109 and @entity112 did n't like each other at the very get go , " @entity3 said			2
" they just did n't see eye - to - eye			0
but now they are best of friends , so that does happen -- mutual respect , or mutual respect over time and getting to know someone			0
" one @entity57 player who will be lining up at @entity124 in @entity125 for thursday 's opening round is @entity3 ' @entity38 teammate and great rival @entity127			1
the veteran formed a formidable partnership with @entity57 rookie @entity131 as the @entity38 built up a 10 - 6 lead over @entity56 heading into the final day at the @entity133			0
but @entity56 , captained by @entity134 , launched a stirring comeback to win 8Â½ points on the final day and retain the trophy			0
four - time major winner @entity127 admits bouncing back from the defeat has been one of the toughest tests of his career , but he is ready to roar into action in @entity16			0
" i think the first two weeks following the @entity57 was a really tough low , one of the biggest lows of my career , " the 42 - year - old told the @entity64 's website			1
" it was a very emotional time because we really thought we were going to win			0
we expected to win ; we were playing well and we thought that we were going to do it on sunday			0
" i think that the disappointment will last a lot longer than a month			0
i feel that over the next two years , we 'll still have the same disappointment from not winning this year 's @entity57			2
" @entity127 has won this event on two previous occasions when it was held in @entity22 , and he is confident of more success at its new home			2
" i enjoyed our first time in @entity22 , but i think this golf course is wonderful , too , " he said			0
" the fact that the golf tournament is moving is nothing different than what we have amongst all of the big major championships in golf			0
this is a great site with a great golf course to host it			0
" i played the course for the first time this morning ; @entity131 and i played a practice round and i really enjoyed it			0
i thought it was fun to play			0
( there is a ) great mixture of holes and challenges , the greens are very fair and i think it 's going to be a fun course			0
