@entity1 operatives linked to senate majority leader @entity3 have launched a new super pac focused on keeping the @entity5 in @entity1 hands in 2016 , when they 'll face a much tougher map and a political climate that favors @entity9			1
the new super pac , called the @entity11 , will work with @entity12 , another major @entity1 super pac , to defend @entity1 - held seats and help nominate the most electable candidates in primaries to contest @entity9 - held seats , according to a source familiar with the group 's plans			1
the source said the group will operate largely in general election and open - seat primary battles , but may also engage in defense of incumbents facing primary challenges			0
@entity12 will also be heavily engaged in the @entity1 presidential general election fight , and @entity1 will have 24 seats to defend in 2016 — far more than the 10 @entity9 must defend , and many in blue - leaning or purple states that are more favorable to @entity9 in a presidential year			0
@entity11 will aim to pick up some of the slack at the @entity5 level , and will coordinate messaging , media buys and fundraising with @entity12			2
@entity33 , @entity34 's former chief of staff who currently heads up @entity12 , will also sit on the board of the @entity11			0
" the @entity5 is under new management — and is taking on president @entity41 's freedom - constricting , big - government agenda , " the group 's website says			0
" as a new , independent super pac , the @entity11 has one goal : to protect and expand the @entity1 @entity5 majority when @entity45 , @entity46 and their army of left - wing activists try to take it back in 2016			2
" according to the @entity51 , which first reported news of the group 's creation , @entity34 and his allies have conceived of the group as an answer to the @entity57 , the @entity9 super pac launched by operatives with ties to @entity5 minority leader @entity45 that engaged heavily in @entity5 races this past cycle .			1
