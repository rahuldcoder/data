@entity19 and her friend agreed and went to their assigned seats when they boarded			2
later they were escorted to the cockpit , she said , and they were there for the rest of the flight			2
such a practice would be illegal on @entity40 carriers , but not necessarily so on international ones , @entity20 aviation correspondent @entity37 said			1
access to the cockpit is up to the discretion of the captain			0
@entity19 provided pictures she said was from the flight she described			1

i 'd just like to make it very clear i do n't think they were distracted at all by posing for pictures			1

@entity92 , a former @entity40 @entity93 chief of staff , said that the long routes in international flying can be boring and some pilots will watch movies on personal computers while the plane is in the cruise portion of the flight			1
but inviting outsiders in the cockpit would be a no - no. " it just violates every code of conduct			0
i do n't believe @entity2 ( would approve of such conduct ) ... they certainly would be shocked at that , " he said			1
after the flight , @entity19 said , @entity17 sent her a @entity16 message , wishing her a safe flight home			1

it 's a really sad story			0
" asked why she had contacted the television program , @entity19 said , " it seems like everybody 's completely in the dark and nobody has any information , so i thought the tiny bit that i have i just want to share and maybe it can help with something			0
" she brushed off suggestions that she was lying about the cockpit adventure and told @entity136 the proof was in the pictures			0

it 's not malicious at all , , " she said			0
" i would n't want to make something up that would potentially hurt people			2
