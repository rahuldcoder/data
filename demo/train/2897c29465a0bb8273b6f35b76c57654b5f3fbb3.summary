-- in 2013 , events such as the @entity3 government shutdown , hot - button issues such as marriage equality and ramped - up debates about privacy and surveillance made headlines and caught readers ' attention			1
many of the perspectives published by @entity14 were shared widely on social media			1
here are some of the most shared op - eds from the year			1
@entity18 : marijuana is safer than alcohol for more than 80 years , our government has spent tens of billions of taxpayer dollars fighting a war against marijuana			2
we arrest three - quarters of a million adults every year , 87 % for simple possession rather than production or sales of marijuana			1
courtrooms turn into assembly lines churning out probationers -- mostly minorities -- with convictions that will make it almost impossible to find employment			2
the result ? marijuana is universally available , used by almost half of @entity3 at some point in their lives , and we 've enriched murderous drug cartels fueling violence in @entity43 that has claimed more than 60,000 lives			1
read more ... @entity18 is a former assistant prosecutor and the director of federal policies at the @entity47 , the primary financial backer of the 2012 campaign to regulate marijuana in @entity51			2
( note : on the subject of marijuana , dr. @entity53 's opinion piece in the @entity55 section was hugely popular : ) dr. @entity53 : why i changed my mind on weed i was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis			2
instead , i lumped them with the high - visibility malingerers , just looking to get high			1
i mistakenly believed the @entity66 listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof			2
surely , they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have " no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse			2
" they did n't have the science to support that claim , and i now know that when it comes to marijuana neither of those things are true			2
it does n't have a high potential for abuse , and there are very legitimate medical applications			2

@entity90 : the courage of teachers each day more than 55 million students attend the country 's 130,000 schools			1
each day , parents and guardians entrust some 7 million teachers with the education of our children			1
and on a normal day , that is all we expect teachers to do -- teach			1
but on those not - so normal days , we are reminded that for six hours a day and more , five days a week , teaching is not the only thing teachers are charged with doing			1
on those not - so - normal days , we are reminded that teachers are also asked to be surrogate parents , protectors , heroes			1

@entity121 : the @entity122 is a surveillance state welcome to a world where @entity124 knows exactly what sort of porn you all like , and more about your interests than your spouse does			1
welcome to a world where your cell phone company knows exactly where you are all the time			2
welcome to the end of private conversations , because increasingly your conversations are conducted by e-mail , text or social networking sites			2
and welcome to a world where all of this , and everything else that you do or is done on a computer , is saved , correlated , studied , passed around from company to company without your knowledge or consent ; and where the government accesses it at will without a warrant			2
welcome to an internet without privacy , and we 've ended up here with hardly a fight			1

" @entity289 : president @entity290 ? if she wants it @entity290 is likely to be the next @entity293 presidential nominee because she is the best - known active @entity293 politician , because she has repeatedly triumphed over adversity and because she has made herself well - liked at a time that politicians are typically viewed with contempt			1
but she is likely to be the next president , the first woman to be president of the @entity3 , because of the quality of her character and her work on behalf of the @entity3 people			1
with some luck , she will use the next two years to restore her energy and prepare for what lies ahead			0
