-- @entity1 , the @entity3 amputee who is running in the @entity5 on prosthetic legs , might be surprised to learn he is part of a history that traces back 3,500 years			1
many ancient civilizations used prosthetic limbs made of wood and metal to get soldiers back into battle			2
they were also used for basic health reasons			2
for example , archaeologists have found two very old @entity20 artificial big toes that had been skillfully crafted			0
one toe was still fastened onto the right foot of the mummy of the daughter of an @entity20 priest , who may have suffered from diabetes			0
how good were the @entity20 prosthetics ? modern volunteers with similar amputations tried them on and reported the toes were both comfortable and highly efficient during walking			0
for most of history , prosthetic limbs were used primarily to restore function and secondarily to mimic the human form ( one of the @entity20 toes even had a false toenail )			2
in the 1980s , prosthetic limbs underwent a radical evolution when high - tech materials , sophisticated electronics , hydraulics and even microprocessor - controlled joints began appearing			1
today , @entity1 ' " @entity46 " legs are made of sophisticated curved composite carbon fiber that can handle fast running			1
there is no doubt that @entity1 , dubbed " @entity1 , " is a world - class athlete			1
born with missing fibulas , his legs were amputated below the knees as a baby			2
@entity1 holds the double - amputee world records for the 100 - , 200 - and 400 - meter dashes , and he has performed well against able - bodied athletes in international competitions			1
he is also courageous and determined			0
in 2007 , however , the @entity61 banned @entity1 from competing in able - bodied competitions after tests at the @entity65 @entity64 showed the @entity46 blades allowed him to expend less energy than able - bodied runners			1
@entity1 assembled his own legal and scientific team and successfully appealed to the @entity70 in @entity64			1
further tests showed that @entity1 uses energy at the same rate as other elite runners , and that the @entity46 legs are not more efficient than human legs			1
also , while his artificial limbs are lighter than human legs , he must push off the ground harder to get the same thrust , which cancels out any advantage			2
the @entity61 decision was overturned			2
however , the story is far from over			0
the ruling only applies to @entity1 , and right now there is no general decision nor any guidelines about the future use of what the court called " adaptive sports equipment			1
" the issue will have to be revisited by each new athlete who wants to use artificial mechanisms in competition			0
what happens if one day prosthetic technology advances past the able - bodied athlete ? the biophysicist @entity98 of @entity99 , himself a double amputee and one of the scientists who tested @entity1 , suggests that athletes will simply have to use less advanced technology to keep them on par with able - bodied athletes			1
but such a standard is clearly untenable			0
we do not ultimately know the degree to which technology mimics true physiological function			2
what if an amputee high jumper wants to use @entity46 ; what level of springiness is " fair " against able - bodied athletes ? what about a swimmer who wants to use prosthetic hands or legs ? or an archer whose prosthetic arm does not tremble like an arm of flesh and blood ? we do not have metrics that can determine true equivalence with able - bodied athletes			1
then there is the issue of fairness			0
in this year 's @entity135 @entity137 trials , @entity133 , the two - time olympian and 5k @entity135 record holder , was eliminated from the marathon team because of leg cramps			1
@entity1 can not get cramps in his calves because he does not have any , and so he can never be eliminated based on this criterion			1
the @entity1 case confronts us with two important questions			1
what is a disability ? and what is the rationale for elite sport ? defining " disability " is a notoriously slippery enterprise			0
in 1997 , @entity152 , a professional golfer with a circulatory disorder , sued under the @entity135 with @entity154 to be allowed to use a golf cart to play in the @entity156			0
the @entity157 argued that walking the 72 holes while playing world - class golf was a significant factor in tournament play			2
who determines what components of a sport are part of its competitive fabric ? in the @entity152 case , it was the @entity135 @entity171 , who overruled the @entity157 and allowed @entity152 to use a golf cart			0
the world is not divided into the disabled and the able - bodied			1
" disability " is a medical term , but it is also a legal and a social term ; one can have a disability according to medicine but not law , or be considered disabled by social convention but not law or medicine			0
" @entity195 " refers to a range of functioning , and a good case can often be made that those at the lower end of the " normal " range have a disability			0
where we draw the line can be arbitrary			0
what is the purpose of sport ? sport is an artificial world			0
the rules of a game , the distances we run , the criteria for inclusion are all made up , and we change them regularly			0
we can either have pitchers in professional baseball bat , as in the @entity212 , or have a designated hitter as in the @entity214			0
neither is " right , " no matter how passionately some feel about it			0
the great symbolic power of the @entity137 is that we all agree on the same rules and then abide by them			2
many opposed to @entity1 ' inclusion in the @entity137 argue that fair competition requires people who start with the same basic physiological equipment			1
@entity1 ' supporters argue instead that fairness in sport means allowing all qualified people to compete , even those born without fibulas			1
@entity1 did not advance to the men 's 400 - meter final , but he is still an inspiration			1
the decision to let him compete in the @entity137 is the beginning of this conundrum			1
more and more , our powerful technological achievements will butt heads with our sense of naturalness and fairness			0
a lot of the debate and controversy around biotechnology will be played out in athletic competitions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253 .			2

@entity1 is running in the 2012 olympics on prosthetic legs
@entity258 : is it fair for amputee athletes to compete with able - bodied athletes ?
he asks what would happen when prosthetic technology becomes even more advanced
@entity253 : decision to let @entity1 participate in the @entity137 raises many *ethical* issues
