@entity0 -- a federal appeals court on monday affirmed the conviction and life sentence for convicted terrorist and 9/11 co-conspirator @entity6			1
@entity6 had agreed to plead guilty in 2005 to six criminal conspiracy charges arising from the @entity9 terror plot to use commercial aircraft to strike key @entity12 targets on september 11 , 2001 , in the worst domestic terror attack in @entity12 history			1
a three - judge panel of the @entity16 for the @entity17 concluded @entity6 's trial was fair , despite the defendant representing himself against the advice of the trial judge and his own lawyers			2
the judges said a life sentence imposed by the jury was appropriate			0
" @entity6 , having pled guilty , has waived all nonjurisdictional errors leading up to his conviction except those affecting the adequacy of his pleas , " the panel said			0
@entity6 has been held by the government since august 2001 , and was the first person charged in the @entity12 in connection with the 9/11 attacks			1
he was indicted in december 2001 , accused of being part of a broader terror conspiracy in the months leading up to 9/11			2
several other accused top @entity9 officials -- including alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity39 -- are awaiting transfer into federal custody and future prosecution in civilian courts , the same as @entity6			1
government sources have told @entity1 that three top @entity9 detainees have told their interrogators that @entity6 was not meant for the 9/11 plot , but for a future terror operation			1
@entity6 had said as much in open court , admitting allegiance to @entity9 leader @entity51 , but denying he was to have been part of the 9/11 hijacking of planes			1
prosecutors had questioned the validity of some of his claims			0
the 41 - year - old faced the death penalty , but was instead given life in prison , and serves his sentence at the so - called " @entity66 " correctional facility in @entity65			2
his trial was delayed for many months over whether the @entity69 citizen of @entity71 descent had the right to introduce testimony from the three top @entity9 leaders who he said may have evidence that could clear him			1
the court agreed but said no direct access was allowed , only written summaries of the interrogations			2
that evidence was the key basis of @entity6 's current appeal			1
" we find it significant that @entity6 never sought to rescind the admissions he had just made " at his march 2005 guilty plea , wrote the judges , " nor to withdraw his guilty plea during the nearly three - year long period that elapsed between his [ initial ] appeal and the conclusion of the sentencing proceeding			2
" @entity6 tried to use @entity51 's own words to help his case			0
the @entity102 leader -- reportedly in hiding in @entity103 or @entity104 -- said in an audio message , " i was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers -- @entity107 have mercy upon them --- with those raids ... and i did not assign brother @entity6 to be with them on that mission			0
" those 19 @entity114 men were the @entity9 members aboard the planes that crashed one 9/11			1
at the same time , the defendant also claimed he was supposed to fly a fifth plane into the @entity118 , and that @entity119 , the so - called " shoe bomber " was supposed to be on his hijacking team			0
only four planes were involved in the 9/11 attacks			1
but after his may 2006 sentencing , @entity6 claimed he lied on the stand			0
his erratic behavior at trial , including his frequent outbursts and threats and his insistence of representing himself for a time , led to calls for a mistrial by his legal team			0
in his last public appearance at his sentencing , @entity6 waved the " v " victory sign , and attacked the @entity12			1
" we will come back another day , " @entity6 told the court			0
" as long as you do n't hear , @entity12 , you will feel			1
you will never get him			0
" @entity6 now has the option of asking the full appeals court to hear his case or of going directly to the @entity146			0
the justices had earlier refused to stop his trial from going ahead			0
the case is @entity6 v. @entity12 ( 06 - 4494 )			2

convicted terrorist and 9/11 co-conspirator *remains* in *maximum* security prison
he was first person charged in the @entity12 in connection with 9/11 attacks
in appeal , he said he should have been allowed to give evidence from @entity9 leaders
