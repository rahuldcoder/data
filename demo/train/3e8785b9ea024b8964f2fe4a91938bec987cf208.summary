-- @entity2 president @entity1 said saturday that the country 's state of emergency , in effect since 1963 , should be lifted by next week at the latest -- but that the final decision is up to the newly sworn - in @entity7			1

the law also bars detainees who have n't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations			0
" we ( will ) lift the state of emergency contrary to the opinion of many others who think this might lead to imbalance in the state of security , " @entity1 said as he chaired a meeting of the new government			2
" i disagree with this , and i think this will consolidate the security of the country			0
" the president indicated he wants a new law allowing demonstrations to take place while protecting the public from " any chaos or damage to properties " and allowing @entity2 security forces to enforce the law			2
" we have to distinguish between reform and chaos , " he said			0
" the @entity2 people are civilized people			0
