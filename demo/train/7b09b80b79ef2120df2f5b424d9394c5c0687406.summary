@entity0 -- beginning saturday , many air travelers will be asked their birth dates and genders when making airline reservations			1
the new travel rules are the latest " visible " expansion of the @entity9 program			0
it 's the latest " publicly visible " expansion of @entity9 , a program that transfers responsibility for checking air passengers ' identities from the airlines to the federal government , the @entity10 said			1
the change keeps the agency on track to assume responsibility for @entity23 checks on all domestic flights by early next year , according to the @entity10			1
currently , the airlines check passenger identifications against lists of suspected terrorists			0
but the @entity29 said the job was better suited for the federal government , which compiles the " terror watch lists			2
" government control increases security , according to the @entity10 , while reducing the number of instances in which innocent people are mistakenly confused with possible terrorists having similar or identical names			2
in may , the federal government began the first public phase of " @entity9 " when four small airlines began asking passengers to provide their names , as the names appeared on the government - issued ids they would be traveling with , when making reservations			1
since then , additional airlines have begun asking for full names , @entity10 spokeswoman @entity51 said , though she declined to say how many airlines are participating for security reasons			0
the new change requires travelers to provide three pieces of information when making reservations : the passenger 's full name as it appears on the government - issued @entity23 they will be using , their birth date and their gender			2
the airline will transmit that information to the @entity10 , which will compare it to a " no - fly " list of people prohibited from flying or a list of " selectees " who can fly after they pass additional physical screening			0
if passengers are not asked for this addition information , they should not be concerned , as it will not affect their travel , the agency said			1
early efforts to create the @entity9 program were beset by problems , including program delays and complaints of privacy breaches			0
finally , in 2006 , after the @entity10 spent more than $ 130 million and four years on the system , then - @entity10 director @entity84 ordered a complete overhaul of the program and dropped plans to check passengers ' names against commercial databases , one of the most contentious features of the program			2
" @entity9 is a key tool in confirming that someone identified as a ' no fly ' does not receive a boarding pass , " @entity10 acting administrator @entity93 said in a statement wednesday			0
" @entity9 will make travel safer and easier for passengers			0
" the @entity10 says it plans to vet 100 percent of passengers on all domestic commercial flights by early next year and 100 percent of passengers on all international commercial flights by the end of 2010 .			1
