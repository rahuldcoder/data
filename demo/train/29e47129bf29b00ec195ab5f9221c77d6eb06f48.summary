-- in the grand scheme of things , @entity5 's answer to @entity0 's @entity6 regarding whether race played a role in the backlash to his " the decision " special -- " i think so , at times			1
it 's always , you know , a race factor			1
" -- was n't much			0
this was n't @entity15 supporting then - teammate @entity17 's assertion that , if @entity19 was black , " he 'd be just another good guy			2
" yet here we are			0
for those of you who may have missed it , @entity5 chose to announce he was leaving his home state @entity25 via " @entity26 , " an hourlong , prime - time special aired on @entity28			1
this was not the best decision anyone has ever made			0
in fact , in the annals of @entity35 - related tv decisions , it may rank just above @entity40 's deciding he 'd make a good late - night talk show host and just below everything else			2
when at the end of the hour @entity5 announced -- finally -- that he was " taking his talents to @entity45 " ( making him sound more like a particularly driven @entity47 waitress than an elite professional athlete ) , the sports world could stop holding its collective breath			1
many used that very next breath to refer to @entity5 as some sort of selfish expletive			1
this was the equivalent of a breakup via @entity57 times a million			0
the fact that the advertising revenue -- some $ 3 million -- went to the @entity60 did n't make it any less self - serving and egotistical and misguided			2
@entity5 probably keeps that much on his @entity62 card			1
somewhere along the line , though , the self - righteousness of the backlash eclipsed the selfishness of the initial announcement			1
and with that one innocuous comment on @entity0 , the backlash actually became the story itself			2
noted good decision - maker and @entity74 analyst @entity72 stated on @entity76 radio that @entity5 's continued decisions were " like watching a movie -- just when you think it could n't get any stupider , it gets more stupid			1
" @entity72 was 100 percent correct ; just not in the way he intended			0
some things worth noting : @entity5 did n't bring up the racial element , @entity6 -- who previously anchored a @entity0 special entitled " @entity86 " -- did			1
his statement was in response to the question , " do you think there 's a role that race plays in this ? " what was he supposed to say ? " no " ? just because we elected @entity96 , a black man , to the presidency , does not mean we immediately moved on to some sort of utopian post-racial society			1
@entity5 did n't say all the backlash was racial in nature			1
he did n't even say that most of it was			0
he did n't call anyone a racist			2
@entity104 , he did n't really say anything at all			0
he did n't " play the race card " as much as quickly drop it face - down in the discard pile			1
@entity5 was 100 percent correct			1
even @entity5 's closest advisor , @entity111 's less nuanced follow - up : " it definitely played a role in some of the stuff coming out of the media , things that were written for sure " seemed true enough after , well , things that were written			1
there was n't anything particularly overt , except for ( mostly white ) sportswriters lamenting @entity5 's sense of entitlement while displaying an absolutely shocking amount of their own			2
in the prologue to his 2006 book , " forty million dollar slaves , " @entity122 wrote : " today 's generation of pro athletes may be wealthy , but they are simultaneously cheered and resented -- a tension that ca n't last forever			0
" we like our greatest athletes to stick to a time - worn script , to stay where they are and persevere until mountains are climbed , hurdles are hurdled , bullies are vanquished and championships are won			2
we 're able to overlook the staggering salaries and outrageous ticket prices in hopes of seeing another @entity140 , another @entity141 , another bird			0
we like our sports stories to build like fairy tales , to end with @entity145 vanquishing the giant , with @entity147 going to the ball , with " and they all lived happily ever after			0
" and when a superstar departs from this storyline , we feel betrayed			0
how could you do this to us ? to claim that such reactions do n't split at least partially on racial lines is to be either irrationally optimistic or willfully blindered			0
even the numbers support a division			0
according to a @entity159 popularity poll taken after " @entity26 , " @entity5 's negative q rating amongst nonblacks went from 24 percent to 44 , while among blacks it only gained one point , from 14 percent to 15			1
those numbers ca n't be explained away , or attributed to some sort of polling error			0
to deny the racial aspect of the backlash entirely -- well , just when you think it ca n't get any stupider , it gets more stupid			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

@entity5 said race played a role in backlash to " @entity26 "
his announcement generated more negative reaction from whites , says @entity184
he says @entity5 was asked about race factor , and never said anyone was being a racist
@entity184 : self - righteousness of backlash eclipsed selfishness of announcement
