@entity0 poured his grief into the thing he loved most : carpentry			2
shaken by the @entity4 , the retired teacher and longtime resident of @entity7 went to his barn , picked up an oak children 's bench and went to work			1
he sawed away , cutting it into two shelves			2
on one , he made 20 individual slots for candles , one for each slain child			2
on the other , he placed six candles for the heroic educators			2
he drove into town , unsure of his destination			1
at the intersection of @entity22 and @entity23 , he felt a tug			1
after all , the park there is called @entity27			2
on a tree and nearby street pole , there were two signs			2
both read : pray for @entity7			1
it was the perfect spot			2
just enough room to fit the shelves , and just enough space to let people hug , pray and cry			2
he and his wife , @entity39 , placed the shelf for the children in front and the one for the educators in the back , as if still watching over their young students			2
@entity0 struggled to light each candle			2
" it was really hitting me , " he said , " with how many were involved			2
" glimpses of normalcy amid reminders of horror a car pulled up and a man placed a giant brown teddy bear next to the makeshift shrine			1
the memorial grew and grew			2
" we did it to help ourselves , and maybe the town , " said @entity0 , a resident of 15 years			1
" i just wanted to do something			2
now , i 'm in awe			0
" the pain in @entity7 is suffocating			1
it 's felt on every corner , in every store , in every church			1
each fresh news report -- each photo of those precious children , those tiny victims with so much youthful exuberance -- brings another wave of emotions , of sorrow , horror and disbelief			1
did you hear a child was shot 11 times ? can you believe the strength of @entity84 -- whose daughter @entity85 was killed -- to forgive the shooter 's family ? why did the shooter take out his rage on such pure innocence ? the shooter 's name is n't mentioned in conversations			1
it 's just too damn painful			0
@entity7 is grappling with other pressing questions : how does the town handle 26 funerals with only one funeral home ? what becomes of the school building , and when do @entity4 students begin school again ? soundwaves : @entity7 wonders how to heal sunday was supposed to be a festive day , filled with holiday revelry as students prepared for the final week before @entity107 holiday			1
instead , churches overflowed with mourners			0
@entity111 clouds stretched from horizon to horizon , a cold drizzle dampening the already somber mood			0
@entity7 was the idyllic @entity117 community -- that @entity118 setting of rolling hills , a town green and an unwavering slice of @entity122			1
the bumper stickers throughout town declared : " nicer in @entity7			1
the town of 27,500 had great schools and great people			1
notable residents have included 1976 @entity131 champion @entity130 , " @entity132 " author @entity133 and cartoonist @entity134			1
it served as a bedroom community for @entity137 and even @entity138 , with people making the 60 - mile commute into the city			1
founded in 1711 , the town in southwestern @entity143 spans 60 square miles , the fifth largest town in area in the state			1
@entity7 's most gruesome crime story had been a murder charge against a husband accused of killing his wife in 1984 ; her remains were found beneath the floor of a barn in 2010			1
but the town was best known for its 100 - foot flagpole that sits , literally , in the middle of @entity22			1
the flagpole also had been the town 's greatest source of controversy for nearly 100 years -- declared a road hazard as cars replaced ox wagons			1
yet the flagpole survived every attempt by highway authorities to remove it			1
it also survived a lightning strike and a car that slammed into it going 55 mph			0
the 12 - foot by 18 - foot flag now flies at half staff , a sad reminder hovering above the town 's center			1
headlines in friday 's @entity178 reported on vandalism at a cemetery and warned of police plans for a sobriety checkpoint over the weekend			0
remembering the victims librarian @entity185 was celebrating with staff at their annual holiday party last friday			1
they were preparing to sing @entity107 carols when word came			0
" we got a call that there was a lockdown at the schools , " she said			0
at one point , they were told the library was in lockdown			0
" we thought they were joking : what could we be locking down the library for ? " she asked			0
" it just got worse as the day went on			0
" many of those precious children had studied in the library 's children 's area , accompanied by their parents			0
she had volunteered at the school over the years ; both her sons attended school there , too			0
one librarian , she said , plans to attend at least six funerals			1
" we just ca n't believe it , " she said in the gentle voice of a well - schooled librarian			1
" i hope this does n't define the town , because it does n't deserve to be remembered as a place of horror			1
" not too far from @entity232 's desk , pamphlets were spread out for any resident to take			0
one began , " facts for families : children and grief			0
" another provided the number for a grief hot line " should you or anyone you know need to talk to someone during this very difficult time			0
" the old town hall will be turned into a grief counseling center monday , complete with privacy screens			1
the @entity249 has established the @entity250 to help families pay for funerals			0
librarians across the country have begun pitching in			0
one book that 's being shipped is called " @entity256 , " considered one of the best at helping people , especially children , cope with tragedy			0
just up the road , @entity0 stood near the memorial with his wife and 22 - year - old stepson , @entity265			1
@entity265 had attended @entity4 in first grade			0
he could n't help but wonder about that classroom of children			1
he likely had studied in that exact same room			0
@entity265 had begun his first day at work on friday , at a dna sequencing job in @entity272			0
his friends teach at the school and " students that they used to have are now dead			0
" " i do n't know what to even say to them , " he said			1
" it just does n't make any sense why he would go into school where these kids ca n't even defend themselves			1
" @entity265 was a senior in high school when the shooter , @entity286 , 20 , was a sophomore			0
he does n't remember much about @entity286 other than the way he dressed			1
" i would see him in the hallway just dressed up formally with a briefcase , like shirt and tie , " he said			0
" he stood out so much wearing such odd apparel to school when we do n't have a dress code			2
" @entity265 glanced at the memorial his stepdad made			0
" it 's a visual representation			0
seeing how many candles there are , it 's just terrible			0
" @entity306 , from the nearby town of @entity305 , stopped to hug people standing at the memorial			2
" this has always been the sweetest of towns			0
it 's held onto its identity , " she said			0
" it 's hard to bear for any town , but this is a particularly kind , good , open , balanced place			1
" she described the memorial as beautiful , and said she stopped at it " because we 're all in this together			0
" @entity0 accepted a hug			0
he taught woodworking , architecture and robotics at nearby @entity324 for 37 years , retiring three years ago			0
he searched for words as to how the tragedy affected him			0
" i taught high school , but i had a special place in my heart for young children			2
" weeping , he walked off			0
like the rest of town , he cried tear soup			2
strangers inspired to honor @entity7 victims			1

the pain in @entity7 is felt on every corner , in every store , in every church
it was the idyllic @entity117 town : rolling hills , a town green , 100 - foot flagpole
