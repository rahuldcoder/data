-- @entity1 , your mother and i are so proud that in less than a week you 'll be graduating college , and from my alma mater , no less ! so this seems an opportune moment to share some thoughts about what you might look for in a career			0
and as luck would have it , i 've just finished a new book , " @entity16 , " which has helped crystallize in my mind some things you ought to consider			2
the book has caused a predictable stir among the pro-equality set because the author , @entity23 is a @entity25 economist with the gall to propose a global tax on wealth			1
but putting aside this @entity30 , socialist claptrap , the book is a veritable treasure trove of advice on getting into ( or staying in ) the top 1 %			1
the book confirms what you already know firsthand : the rich are getting richer ; the really rich are getting really richer ; capital is hot ; labor is not			1
the obvious implication is that you must find a job where the distinction between capital and labor is blurry			1
a job where you can take a slice off the top by getting paid as if you owned a piece of action even though you do n't			1
because without some capital working on your behalf , no amount of even the hardest and most skillful labor will get you anywhere near the top			1
( how many doctors or engineers join the country club these days ? virtually none			0
) the great news is that there is a record amount of capital out there to work on your behalf			2
@entity23 estimates that total capital is up almost threefold since i graduated from college 30 years ago			1
and these days , the real owners of capital do n't seem to notice if people take a little off the top or are largely powerless stop it when they do			1
this was not always the case			0
indeed , @entity71 -- the first economist -- felt that even a " principal clerk " ( his word for ceo ) would always be paid based on his " labour and skill " and never in " proportion to the capital of which he oversees the management			2
" fortunately , times have changed in part because economists -- @entity71 's intellectual heirs -- invented myriad ways like the " principal agent problem , " " competitive assignment models , " or the " marginal product of labor " to justify otherwise outrageous levels of compensation , provided there is enough capital in the picture			1
@entity71 must be turning in his grave ! now you may be wondering : " how much capital will i need working on my behalf ? " it 's a tricky question , but @entity23 provides the answer			1
let 's assume that you wo n't settle for mere membership in the top 1.0 % but have your sights set on the top 0.1 % with a corresponding annual income of roughly $ 4 million			1
@entity23 's analysis of long - run returns ( 4 % to 5 % ) suggests that this would require you to have roughly $ 100 million of capital working on your behalf			1
although this seems daunting -- it 's what the average @entity111 makes in 2,000 years -- fear not , for there are a few places where this type of money can be found : listed stocks : the average @entity119 company has a market value of $ 28 billion ( 280 times more than you need ) and its real owners -- the shareholders -- are virtually powerless to stop senior management from taking 3.0 % or more off the top			1
so even if the company 's performance is lackluster , and the pot is split between you and four or five other top guys , there 's plenty to go around			1
so while the corporate ladder can be long and greasy , it 's worth the climb			2
i 'd suggest you steer clear of smaller companies as they 're just as hard to run as the bigger ones but do n't hold enough capital -- the average @entity142 company has a market value of only $ 1.4 billion -- to be worth your while			1
venture - capital - backed start - ups are also a decent bet provided you get in early and abandon ship at the first sign that the organization is not steadily progressing toward an ipo , or a buyout from @entity153 , @entity154 and the like			1
you might try a few ventures in your 20s and then go back to business school if it has n't worked out			2
@entity159 and hedge funds : this industry is a dream come true			1
the standard take is generous -- a 2.0 % fee plus 20 % profit share -- which should net out to at least 3.0 % assuming average performance and even after deducting the operating expenses of the fund			0
at 3.0 % , you 'll need $ 130 million working for you , which is more than achievable when private equity and hedge fund assets are a record $ 4.5 trillion ( 35,000 times more than you need ) despite lackluster aggregate performance			1
this mountain of capital attracts a lot of competition , so do n't be discouraged if you fail to break into the industry the first few times			1
just keep at it , but please do n't be tempted to cheat , as the government appears to be getting tougher on the insider stuff these days			2
asset management : this is a decent fallback if the hedge fund thing has n't worked out by age 35			1
the take is much lower -- probably 0.6 % after costs -- so you may need $ 600 million or more working on your behalf but do n't be daunted			2
despite strong evidence that the industry destroys value compared with lower - cost index funds , it still manages trillions			0
and the lifestyle is decent as many people secretly accept that they ca n't beat the market so they do n't work that hard trying			0
personal services : if you 're satisfied with being toward the middle of the top 1 % then consider offering personal services to those with capital or access to it			2
they tend to be very brand / quality conscious and willing to pay top dollar for services , particularly when spending the real owners ' money			0
most well - paid service positions are in investment banking , law , and management consulting , though the occasional doctor , psychotherapist , real estate agent , or art adviser can make the cut			0
it goes without saying that you must steer clear of government and the nonprofit sector at all costs			0
although the @entity228 decision suggests that the @entity229 may one day allow it , explicit profit sharing by government officials remains strictly illegal at the moment			0
as a result , you should only consider public service as second career after you 've made the money you need			0
the nonprofit sector is even worse because it holds little capital , has no profits , and generates nothing but a " social " return that would hardly pay the bills even if you got to keep it all			0
finally , never fear that mooching off someone else 's capital is somehow second - rate compared with earning income from your own			2
i 've never felt that way , and nothing could be further from the truth			0
you 'll seldom be exposed to meaningful losses ( even the @entity252 gave back only two years of compensation ) , and your slice is often in addition to , not in lieu of , a decent salary			0
furthermore , if you mooch long enough , you can build your own capital provided you avoid profligate spending , multiple divorces and the like			0
i 'm not denying that there is a certain nostalgic appeal to building your own capital the old - fashioned way by starting a business , or by saving gradually over a lifetime of work			0
but these are risky and time - consuming strategies in the low - growth , high - capital environment you 'll likely be living in			0
son , the time for internships is over , and now your real quest begins			0
in the 21st century , a man without capital runs a grave risk of finding himself squeezed towards the bottom of the top 10 % and possibly even lower			2
this is not a place you want to be			0
somewhere out there is a $ 100 million slice of capital with your name on it just waiting to be found			2
your mother and i have given you everything money can buy , and your children deserve no less			0
i know that you wo n't disappoint us			0

@entity294 writes letter to *imaginary* son turning @entity23 's *controversial* book on its head
@entity300 : if you want to be be super rich , find a job that lets you benefit from others ' capital
he says in such a job , you can take a slice off the top even though you do n't do much
@entity300 : these jobs are in industries like hedge funds , private equity , venture capital
