@entity0 -- a bloody war between @entity6 drug cartels is no longer solely a south - of - the - border problem , members of @entity3 said tuesday at a hearing on the issue			1
a member of the @entity12 patrols in @entity13 during a recent operation to fight drugs			0
the violence accompanying those battles has crept into the @entity18 , and is believed to be largely fueled by money and guns from @entity18 , said sen. @entity21 , @entity22			1
" the drugs are coming north , and we 're sending money and guns south , " said @entity21 , chairman of the @entity23			1
" as a result , these cartels have gained extraordinary power			0
" about 90 percent of guns seized in @entity6 raids are traced back to the @entity18 , according to the federal @entity32 , he said			1
about 2,000 firearms cross the border into @entity6 daily , according to the @entity35 , he added			1
the subcommittee held a joint hearing tuesday on the issue with the @entity39 on @entity40			0
the hearing focused on ways the @entity18 can assist @entity6 president @entity44 's efforts to combat drugs and violence			1
in addition , @entity18 communities are seeing an increase in violent crimes related to the @entity6 drug trade			1
in @entity54 , @entity55 , in 2008 , 366 kidnappings for ransom were reported -- more than in any other @entity18 city , @entity21 said , citing federal statistics			2
the vast majority of those , he said , were related to @entity6 drug cartels			1
" we 're not winning the battle , " @entity55 attorney general @entity61 told lawmakers			0
" the violence that we see in @entity6 is fueled 65 to 70 percent by the trade in one drug : marijuana			1
" @entity61 said he believes the @entity18 can do more to remove the profit from such operations , as well as attempt to reduce the demand for the drugs			2
it 's not only border states that are affected , either			0
authorities believe cartels reached 230 @entity18 cities , up from 50 in 2006 , @entity21 said			1
in his home state of @entity22 , far from the @entity6 border , he said , cartels are believed operate in three cities : @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
lawmakers and witnesses at the hearing universally applauded @entity44 's efforts to deal with drug violence through actions such as sending troops into @entity13			1
" i think he needs every single bit of our support , " said sen. @entity92 , @entity93			0
however , the violence has skyrocketed , @entity61 said , with a new and appalling trend : assassinations of police officers , prosecutors and other officials who are combating cartels			2
perhaps even more horrifying , as the violence increases , so does the possibility that innocent citizens will be caught in it , he said			0
in at least one instance in @entity54 , criminals making a home invasion had the wrong house , he said			0
" the casual fallout is going to be significant if we ca n't do something to try to assist @entity6 in stopping it south of the border , " @entity61 said			2
efforts by @entity55 authorities to fight the violence include intercepting wire transfer payments to smugglers of drugs and of human beings , @entity61 said			0
between 2003 and 2007 , he said , @entity55 seized about $ 17 million in such transfers			0
however , a more comprehensive and regional effort is needed , he said , as the cartels , faced with increasing law enforcement surveillance in one area , will simply take their crimes elsewhere			0
and authorities must target the masterminds and leaders behind the violence , he said : " just arresting and deporting foot soldiers is a waste of critical assets			0
" also tuesday , a federal firearms official told the subcommittee there has been a " troubling increase " in the number of hand - grenades seized from @entity6 drug traffickers recently , and that officials are concerned violence involving explosives could spill into @entity18 border towns			1
" in the past six months , we have noted a troubling increase in the number of grenades seized from , or used by , drug traffickers , " @entity147 of the @entity32 told the @entity23 subcommittee			1
" we are concerned about the possibility of explosives - related violence impacting our @entity18 border towns , " he said			2
@entity147 did not give statistics about the number of hand - grenades seized by @entity32 , nor were statistics immediately available from the agency			0
another federal law enforcement official told the subcommittee he does n't expect @entity6 cartels to intentionally target @entity18 officials and interests " in the near term			1
" @entity166 of the @entity167 said the @entity167 does not believe " that in the near term the cartels will deliberately target @entity18 government personnel or interests or intentionally target @entity18 civilians in the @entity18			2
" but , he added , " defining spillover is a tricky business			0
" @entity1 homeland security correspondent @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
