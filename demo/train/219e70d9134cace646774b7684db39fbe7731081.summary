@entity0 -- with her flaming red hair , @entity5 figure , and lurid green snake casually coiled around the arm , @entity2 looks like a real - life muse emerging from a @entity10 painting			1
it 's impossible not to stare at the neon python on her left wrist			2
but take a closer look and you 'll discover that the reptile slithers in and out of the flesh like a psychedelic needle and thread			0
and her fantastical arm -- described as everything from cool to creepy , and erotic -- is the work of a @entity0 designer reinventing the way we see prosthetic limbs			1
from stereo legs to feather arms , @entity31 's @entity30 crosses into the realm of surrealist art , yet with a very important function			1
" it 's drawing attention to their disability in a positive way , " said de @entity37			0
" rather than people seeing what 's missing , it 's about what they 've got			0
" having an alternative limb is about claiming control and saying ' i 'm an individual and this reflects who i am			1
' " superhuman @entity54 's remarkable work was thrust into the international spotlight last year when model and singer @entity56 wore her @entity59 crystal leg at the @entity61 closing ceremony			1
artificial limbs are usually designed to be as inconspicuous as possible			1
yet here was an amputee proudly stretching her bejeweled leg before a stadium of flashing cameras and millions of tv viewers across the world			1
" generally the whole technology is moving towards trying to recapture a lifelike limb that looks realistic and also acts realistic in motion , " said @entity71			0
" in this instance i 'm doing the complete opposite and i think it does capture that whole childlike imagination -- it 's like being a superhero with super powers			0
" read this : are bionic superhumans on the horizon ? loud and proud for @entity86 - born @entity56 , who had her left leg amputated below the knee as a teenager due to ongoing health problems , alternative limbs are as much a way of expressing herself as the clothes she wears			1
" being a self - confessed fashionista , things that i 'm into tend to change all the time , and like most key pieces in my wardrobe i would only wear it a number of times , " she said			0
" the first time i wore a limb that was so obviously bionic , it gave me a total sense of uniqueness and feeling mutant human in the best way possible			1
" interactive : explore the bionic body similarly @entity2 , who tends to wear her snake arm on nights out with friends , says it makes her feel powerful and sexy			2
" i wanted people to have to look at me twice with amazement , " said @entity2 , a motivational speaker and para triathlete , who was born without an arm below the elbow			0
" i 'd rather people just asked me outright how i lost my arm			0
this is so out there -- like i 'm wanting you to look at me -- that it makes people feel ok to ask questions			0
" a special effect after studying special effects prosthetics for film and tv , de @entity37 worked with a realistic prosthetics company for eight years , continuing to experiment with artistic limbs in her spare time			1
in 2009 she contacted @entity136 with her unique idea for an alternative limb company , and the pair began collaborating on a groundbreaking stereo leg , replete with speakers and stiletto shoe			1
the prototype was a success and de @entity37 's clients now range from ex-military men looking for a sci - fi leg to children wanting a secret compartment to store their pencils			2
the bespoke limbs cost between $ 4,600 and $ 21,000			2
materials vary according to each design , but must be durable , lightweight , and water resistant			0
in @entity156 , the @entity155 currently only funds realistic limbs			2
but @entity54 argued that alternative prostheses could be just as beneficial			1
" the dominant thinking is that a new limb should be as close a match to the previous limb as possible , " she said			0
" but until technology gets to the point where you can have a realistic looking limb in movement and aesthetics , there will always be this uncanny middle ground			0
" having an alternative limb embraces difference and can help create a sense of ownership and empowerment			2
" moving with the times not just aesthetically pioneering , @entity71 is now working on a new series of limbs with alternative functions			1
@entity183 army knife arms with fold - out tools , nightclubbing legs that light up to music , and cooking arms with different attachments for kitchen appliances , are just some of the futuristic designs she 's been working on as part of the project with special effects students at @entity196 , in @entity197			1
there is something undeniably playful about the project			0
after all , one of @entity2 's favorite tricks is walking around with her snake arm poking out the top of her bag			2
" it provokes some strange reactions , " she admitted			0
" but i 've never wanted to just fit in -- i 've always wanted to be different			0
