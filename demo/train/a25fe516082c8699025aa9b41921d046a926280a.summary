all signs indicate @entity2 gov. @entity1 will likely veto politically - charged legislation that supporters say promotes religious freedom and opponents contend discriminates against gays and lesbians			1
@entity1 did not signal her intention either way in an exclusive interview with @entity13 on monday at the @entity15 meeting in @entity16			1
" i can assure you , as always , i will do the right thing for the state of @entity2 , " she said			0
but some @entity2 republicans who know her well say they are confident those comments mean @entity1 will almost surely reject the bill that is generating nationwide controversy			1
the @entity26 - led measure would allow @entity2 business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers as long as they assert their religious beliefs			1
@entity1 is scheduled to return to @entity2 on tuesday , and a source tells @entity13 those familiar with her thinking say she will likely spend at least one full business day in the state before acting			1
" i 'm going to go home , and when i receive the bill , i 'm going to read it and i 'm going to be briefed on it			2
we have been following it			0
and i will make my decision in the near future , " @entity1 told @entity13			2
she has until saturday to sign or veto the bill			2
if she does nothing , it automatically becomes law			0
@entity49 sources say @entity1 considers herself a pro-business governor -- someone who above all else wants to protect and promote @entity2 's economic interests			2
they say she knows full well there will be economic consequences for the state if it has a law on the books perceived to effectively codify discrimination			0
" i have a history of deliberating and having an open dialogue on bills that are controversial , to listen to both sides of those issues , and i welcome the input , and information that they can provide to me			0
and certainly i am pro-business , and that is what 's turning our economy around , so i appreciate their input , as i appreciate the other side , " @entity1 said			2
business leaders in @entity2 and around the country , including the chief executive of @entity78 , have urged @entity1 publicly and privately to veto the bill			1
approval also is likely to trigger lawsuits			0
the bill was pushed by the @entity83 , a conservative group opposed to abortion and same - sex marriage			1
the group argues the proposal protects people against increasingly activist federal courts			0
@entity1 vetoed a similar bill last year , arguing that the state legislature should focus on more pressing issues , such as a @entity94 expansion plan she was promoting			1
sources say she is concerned about this bill taking away from other issues she is now pressing , such as overhauling @entity2 's child protective services system			0
freedom or oppression ? that 's the question for @entity2 's @entity105			0

@entity107 would allow business owners to deny service to gay and lesbians *based* on religious *objections*
some *lawmakers* who know gov. @entity1 believe she *'ll* reject the measure
businesses pressure her to reject the bill pushed by group opposed to abortion , same - sex marriage
