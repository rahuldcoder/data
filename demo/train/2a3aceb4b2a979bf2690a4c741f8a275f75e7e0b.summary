-- @entity1 is being redeployed			1
the coda to last year 's " @entity1 " set up " @entity4 " and , in turn , " @entity4 " is apparently setting up a " @entity1 " sequel			1
@entity7 and parent company @entity6 announced today that @entity9 ' patriotic superhero will go straight into a stand - alone followup scheduled to debut april 4 , 2014			1
while the original " @entity1 " began in the 1940s and saw scrawny @entity1 become a chemically enhanced super-soldier who helped save the @entity14 during @entity15 , the sequel will , understandably , keep him in his chronological position in the present day			2
after being frozen for decades , and resuscitated in the strange new world of contemporary @entity18 , @entity1 is now planning to take it one day at a time			0
@entity7 's announcement said the sequel will pick up where " @entity4 " ( out may 4 ) leaves off , " as @entity1 continues his affiliation with @entity23 and @entity24 and struggles to embrace his role in the modern world			1
" what we can infer from that ( apart from the obvious , that " @entity1 " survives the ordeal of " @entity4 " ) is that @entity31 sounds like he will be a significant part of the sequel , as opposed to the glorified cameos he has done in other @entity7 movies			1
no other details about the project were released			0
" @entity43 " ( or whatever it is eventually called â € ” let 's pray it 's not " @entity42 , " or some such ) wo n't be the first sequel to hit theaters after " @entity4			2
" that honor goes to " @entity45 , " which is aiming for release nov. 15 , 2013 , with " @entity47 " director @entity48 taking over for @entity49			0
one question , though : after all he 's been through , is n't it time @entity1 got promoted ? " @entity53 " @entity1 ? guess that does n't have the same ring			0
