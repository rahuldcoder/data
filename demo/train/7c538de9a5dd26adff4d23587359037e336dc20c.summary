-- the recession means competition in pro football this year is n't restricted to the gridiron			2
the @entity5 and its 32 teams also are battling for the consumer 's discretionary spending dollars			1
less - established @entity5 teams , such as the @entity10 , face special challenges in the recession			1
and just like on the playing field , some teams are having an easier time scoring an economic touchdown than others			0
" overall ticket sales are very positive but difficult in these challenging times , " @entity5 spokesman @entity17 said in a statement			1
he did not provide overall ticket sales numbers for the current season			1
the league is coming off a year that saw overall attendance drop slightly , 0.7 percent , from 2007 amid the start of the economic slowdown			0
@entity27 , a @entity10 vice president and the team 's chief financial officer , said the team started to see the impact of the recession last year , when single - game ticket sales and concession revenue dropped as the season progressed			1
heading into this season , he said , sales are off even more than the team expected -- new ticket sales are down 75 percent from last year and season ticket renewals are down 10 percent			1
no @entity42 games are sold out , despite a recent survey by @entity44 that found 76 percent of adults in @entity46 , @entity47 , regularly follow the @entity10 -- the fifth - best percentage of any @entity5 market			1
" the economy is having that impact on us , " @entity27 said			0
" as a very small market , i think we 're feeling it more than some of the other teams in the league			0
" the @entity58 also have yet to sell out any of their games , though the team expects that could change with the recent high - profile signing of quarterback @entity62			1
within a day of @entity62 's signing , the @entity58 had sold an additional 3,000 season tickets and 10,000 single - game tickets			1
" the economy 's affecting all professional sports teams , " said @entity66 , the @entity58 ' vice president of sales and marketing			1
" we 're not only competing for people 's time and money , but trying to keep the fans in the stadium on game day as opposed to watching on tv			2
" @entity66 said there were n't a large number of cancellations in season ticket holder accounts			2
however , some fans did trim down the number of seats in their respective accounts			0
@entity66 added some are coming back on board as the season approaches			0
the @entity88 are getting nationwide exposure through the @entity91 reality series " @entity96 , " which chronicles the team 's training camp and preparation for the upcoming season			1
however , the @entity88 ' streak of 44 straight sellouts , a franchise record , is at risk , according to spokesman @entity101			1
the @entity88 ' september 13 home opener against @entity103 is not sold out yet			1
some teams , however , are more than holding their own as far as ticket sales go despite the nation 's fiscal woes			1
the @entity103 are sold out for the 40th straight year -- dating back to the first game of the 1970 season , according to spokesman @entity110			1
and @entity112 spokesman @entity111 says the team is sold out for the 25th straight season			1
he adds the season ticket renewal rate is well over 90 percent , on par with the prior decade			2
according to league spokesman @entity17 , 24 of the @entity5 's 32 teams did not raise ticket prices from last year			1
one of the teams that did is the @entity120 , which bumped up the cost of 10 percent of its season ticket holder seats , according to team spokesman @entity124			2
all games are sold out			0
two factors working in the @entity120 ' favor -- they have a new stadium that opened last season and the team has been a perennial contender for the past decade			0
in order to try and offset the impact the economy has on the game , @entity17 said teams have created more options and flexibility for fans in order to help them afford tickets			0
among those options are half - season ticket plans , such as the ones offered by the @entity10 and the @entity146			1
" we knew some season ticket holders because of the economy would n't be able to afford to come to all 10 games ( including the preseason ) , " said the @entity10 ' @entity27			1
the half - season plan has been very popular , he said			0
" we wanted to make as many products available to them whether they could come to one game , two games or with the half package we 've bundled five games in each package so they can come for half a season			0
" @entity27 said the team is also considering introducing a package where fans can purchase tickets for a few games of their choice			0
@entity165 , executive director of the @entity166 , thinks the best way for teams to limit the recession 's impact on ticket sales is to offer exemplary customer service			1
" these fans need to feel as though they 're having a great time and they 're getting value for their money , " said @entity165			0
" if they 're able to do that , they will justify continuing to spend on the @entity5 , because every game matters			1
they want to be part of the continuity of the @entity5 season			1
" @entity165 believes the league has to fight the recession on two fronts			2
he says the first is the pricing of seats to everyday fans -- especially those in markets where the demand is n't as keen as the @entity5 would like			1
the second challenge is corporate resistance			0
" you have those that have traditionally purchased seats or acquired sponsorships taking a long look at whether they want to be involved this year or not , and a lot of corporate budgets are already in bed for the rest of the year , " explained @entity165			0
still , @entity165 believes the @entity5 may be well - equipped to weather the economic storm , thanks in large part to timing			1
" there 's a general feel that things are picking up in the economy , and i think that 's going to bode well for them over time			2
they may have survived this downturn a little better than the other leagues			0
" @entity216 has been a @entity218 season ticket holder for the past five years			2
he said he briefly considered whether to cancel his subscription heading into this year but decided against it -- citing the team 's long waiting list to get season tickets			2
" i swore to myself if i ever got @entity218 season tickets , i 'd do everything in my power to keep them , " @entity216 said			0
however , he did turn down an option to upgrade to different seats and a parking pass , saying he would have considered it in years past but not under the current economic climate			0
he also might sell his tickets for certain games online			0
" i 'm thinking of going on @entity234 and selling a couple of tickets			0
i eat so much of the cost for the preseason tickets , because you have to pay full price for those , " @entity216 said			0
one ticket for an @entity5 game this year on the secondary ticket seller goes for an average of $ 151 , compared with $ 156 at this time a year ago			1
four - year @entity248 season ticket holder @entity246 held on to his subscription and plans to make cutbacks instead when it comes to concessions and tailgating costs			2
however , he may get rid of some of his tickets before the season is over			0
" if they 're not doing well , i would maybe try to sell the tickets for some of the cold weather games , " @entity246 said			0
@entity246 and @entity216 admit surrendering their season ticket packages for good would be a painful decision			2
" the atmosphere is unmatched , " @entity246 said			0
" there 's nothing like being in the stadium or in the parking lot when the @entity248 are doing well			2
" @entity216 says the camaraderie is worth the cost			0
" i just like the experience of sitting in the parking lot under a tent , tailgating , drinking beer and then going to the game and having a good time watching the @entity218			0

for @entity10 , ticket sales off more than expected
@entity88 and @entity58 also looking to score more sales
@entity103 and @entity112 holding the line despite recession
sports expert says @entity5 's best weapon would be exemplary customer service
