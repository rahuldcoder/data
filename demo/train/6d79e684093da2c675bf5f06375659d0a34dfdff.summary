with more than 700 million mobile broadband subscribers across the continent , it 's little wonder a growing number of young entrepreneurs are jumping on the digital bandwagon and creating innovate , interactive content for their home market			1
one such man is @entity19 @entity18			0
earlier this year he launched @entity20 , a gaming firm aimed at creating culturally relevant content that reflects the lives of average @entity19			1
" @entity19 is the largest country in the continent , " he said			0
" it has the fastest growing internet users , fastest growing mobile users and the shared nature of the @entity19 people is how they love to consume			1
" they are very keen on new trends and new content			2
so there is an immense opportunity and you can already see that with loads of other young tech start ups			1
" @entity18 took inspiration from the @entity41 - based company @entity40 , which was founded in 2007			2
its development of hugely popular games like @entity45 and @entity46 introduced gaming to a new and even wider audience			2
it also gave @entity18 the determination to tap into the market of around 44 million @entity19 internet users , by offering them a local gaming experience			1
his firm now creates apps developed by @entity2 , for the @entity2 market , which can be played through websites like @entity59 or on mobile devices			1
" @entity67 " is just one of @entity20 's browser games that has a local narrative , in which the player weaves in and out of @entity19 's pot - holed roads , avoiding oncoming traffic			1
@entity68 " @entity67 " @entity18 said : " @entity70 ( motorbikes ) are everywhere -- it 's insane			0
our game allows people to get a local interactive experience			1
they can drive around pot holes and tuk tuks			0
we brought in local sounds from busy streets			2
" @entity18 is not alone in his crusade to turn @entity83 into a mobile gaming continent			1
@entity85 founded the digital company @entity86 in 2009			2
" when i started the company three years ago there was a global market for this , but there was n't an @entity2 market , " she said			1
" the skill set was here , but companies did n't believe it was worth investing			0
for us we are prioritizing content for @entity83			1
" @entity86 now employs nine people in @entity83 and @entity100			1
its primary focus is educational gaming for teenagers and young adults who use smart phones and basic @entity107 or @entity108 handsets			1
" our focus is games for change , " said @entity85			2
" we have developed a game called @entity113			2
it 's part of a partnership with @entity116 and its aim is to end violence against women			2
as you play the games you answer questions related to gender - based violence			1
" the games are available for free , with revenue generated through sponsorship and advertising			2
@entity18 also believes games can be educational			1
he said : " our focus is on the interactivity and the fun			2
but if we can offer another element then we think that could be a way for us to give back			0
" in a game of multiple levels the challenge becomes more difficult			0
we 're looking at educating people between levels			0
you can score extra points if you answer questions ( related to the game 's genre ) correctly			0
" along with providing a fun , interactive and sometimes educational experience , @entity83 's burgeoning digital industry is also creating jobs			1
it is estimated that 70 % of @entity83 's young people are jobless but a growing number are capitalizing on the digital market and are setting up their own companies			1

" we have a 12 - hour power supply and 12 - hour internet supply			0
we pay a flat rate over a 12 - month period and that has significantly reduced our operation costs			0
" @entity177 agrees that networking is paramount to building a successful tech industry across the continent			0

" it 's about creating a network , not only of youth , young students , young professionals , young entrepreneurs , but more experienced professionals , " she said			1
" the captains of industries , the dignitaries , people that have that inside knowledge they can share with them			0
" we ca n't wait around for the government or older generations to do everything for us			0
" for @entity18 , waiting around is definitely not an option			0
he plans to develop his company quickly and release more titles soon			0
" it is very , very challenging but the opportunities are immense			0
