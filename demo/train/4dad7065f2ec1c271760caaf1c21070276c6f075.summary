" i do n't want anyone to go through what i have gone through , " he said			1
" words ca n't describe it , nothing has changed ( with the church )			1
" when the alleged sexual abuse began , @entity10 was 14 and assigned to the post of parish sacristan -- someone who is responsible for preparing the church sanctuary for @entity30 , as well as cleaning up afterward -- according to the complaint			1
" @entity10 was brave enough to come forward and put a face to the real tragedy that 's been happening not only to him , but probably countless other in the @entity35 , " said @entity34 , @entity10 's attorney			2
raised @entity36 , @entity10 now struggles with his faith			2
he does not attend @entity30 and will not let his son become a parish sacristan			2

@entity11 was a family friend for nearly 40 years , said @entity54 , @entity10 's father			1
" it 's a shock for a parent , it challenges our faith , " the senior @entity10 said			0
" you have to think , how did n't we know , and why did n't he tell us			1
" at the time , he said , he and his wife were proud their son was chosen to work in the church			0
the complaint comes in the wake of the @entity66 charging on february 10 three @entity0 priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care , while a former official with the @entity35 was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children , following the release of a scathing grand jury report			1
the lawsuit was filed in response to new information released in the 2011 grand jury report that involves monsignor @entity82 , who is facing criminal charges for endangering the welfare of children and having knowledge about a perpetrator			1
@entity82 served as the secretary for clergy under the former @entity0 archbishop @entity5			0
this year 's grand jury report is the second priest sexual abuse grand jury report in @entity0 , and the first time that a catholic church leader has been charged criminally for an alleged cover - up			1
the lawsuit filed monday alleges " @entity4 officials conspired to endanger the safety of the plaintiff when they actively concealed their knowledge of priest 's previous offenses , lied to parishioners , and created a sham sexual abuse victim assistance program for the @entity4 , " according to a statement from @entity10 's attorneys			1
he is seeking more than $ 50,000 in damages			0
" this is n't about the money , " @entity10 said			1
" no other kid should have to go through this			0
no other person should have to live with this for two minutes , let alone 15 years			2
" @entity10 's attorneys filed another sexual abuse lawsuit on february 14 on behalf of a @entity0 man who claims two priests at two separate schools sexually abused him , said attorney @entity34			1
" both of these cases clearly demonstrate the nefarious ways that the hierarchy of the @entity4 utilized to not only intimidate survivors through their so called " victim 's assistance " program , but also how they actively engaged in a coverup of known sex abusers who were permitted to continue victimizing untold numbers of other children , " @entity34 said			0
@entity1 's @entity130 contributed to this report			0
