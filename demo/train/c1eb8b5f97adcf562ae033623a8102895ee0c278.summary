@entity0 -- three days after embattled @entity4 chairman @entity3 announced his resignation , the @entity2 announced president @entity6 intends to nominate @entity7 , a professor at @entity8 , to the agency 's top post			1
" the president has made clear that we need a strong @entity4 , and he believes @entity7 is the right person to lead the @entity4 , " @entity2 spokesman @entity11 said in a statement			1
" dr. @entity7 is a highly regarded expert who was a member of the president 's @entity15 on @entity18 's @entity17 , and has spent years analyzing nuclear issues while at @entity8 , @entity20 as well as at @entity21 , " @entity11 said			1
she received her doctorate degree from the @entity21 and served fellowships at @entity25 and @entity20 universities during her academic career			0
much of @entity7 's university research has included nuclear energy , and specifically the back - end nuclear fuel cycle , or nuclear waste , according to her @entity8 biography			1
@entity7 's expertise in nuclear waste disposal and her criticism of plans to dispose nuclear waste at the @entity37 in @entity38 makes her nomination a more popular choice with senate majority leader @entity41			2
the @entity37 site has long been a political lightening rod for the @entity38 senator			0
in her book , " @entity45 : @entity37 and the @entity52 , " @entity7 claims , " although geologic repositories are the best solution to the nuclear waste problem , there are substantial uncertainties in projecting the performance of a geologic repository far into the future			2
" after the @entity2 's announcement , @entity41 gave @entity7 a ringing endorsement			0

" @entity7 's selection reveals that president @entity6 and @entity41 have a @entity37 litmus test for any prospective nuclear chief			1
as we continue overseeing the agency and its leadership , our litmus test will be their adherence to the law -- including the law on @entity37 , " @entity75 members of the @entity76 said in a statement			0
in his resignation announcement monday , @entity3 said he intended to stay on until a successor is confirmed by the @entity87 , a message he echoed during a press conference on wednesday in @entity90			2
the quick move to nominate @entity3 's successor could be a signal the @entity2 hopes to move beyond the controversy that has surrounded his tenure as the agency 's chairman			1
@entity3 , a former top aide to @entity41 , has been under fire after complaints from @entity101 and @entity67 on the commission about his management style surfaced last year			1
last month , @entity3 denied allegations that he targeted women and created a hostile work environment			0
the accusations came amid a political fight between @entity110 and the @entity2 over who should serve on the five - member commission that oversees the nation 's nuclear industry regulation			0
@entity3 served on the panel for almost eight years , including three as chairman			2
he was nominated for the @entity4 's top spot by president @entity6 in 2009			1
in a statement to @entity1 , @entity3 said , " i have known @entity7 for a long time , and i think she is well - qualified to carry on my strong focus on the vital public health and safety mission of the @entity4			1
" @entity7 's nomination now heads to the @entity124 , which oversees the @entity4 , in june			2
if approved by the committee @entity7 's nomination would then go before the full @entity87 for confirmation			0
