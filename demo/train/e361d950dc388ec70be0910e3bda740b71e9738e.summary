-- whether @entity3 stays or goes , the turmoil - wracked country is likely to be in for more of a rough time , two @entity2 experts told @entity0 monday			1
" whichever way this goes , i think there 's going to be a good amount of chaos , " said @entity6 , associate professor of government at @entity8			1
during his 42 years in power , @entity3 has limited the formation of political and other institutions , @entity6 said			1
" all civil society organizations have been eviscerated by the regime , " he said			1
in a telephone interview monday night , he predicted more bloodshed if @entity3 steps aside			1
" we could see some tribal uprisings " as competing groups seek a share of @entity2 's oil wealth , he said , describing the likely scenario as " not very pretty			1
" but , he added , oil exports will likely continue after " some " interruption			0
" it would be in the interest of all parties that oil keep flowing , " he said , dismissing as unlikely any apocalyptic scenario in which @entity2 would descend into civil war			1
the current uncertainty will likely be decided in the next few days , he predicted			0
" it seems to me that we 're in an endgame here , " he said			0
" the big question is how much bloodshed we 're going to see			0
" he called the violence against unarmed civilians " extraordinary , but not surprising from a regime that 's truly entrenched			2
" there are few candidates in the wings to replace @entity3 -- " no younger leadership able to assume that mantle of leadership , " he said			1
but @entity3 's imminent departure is not a foregone conclusion , he added , putting the odds at " 80 % go , 20 % stay			1
" @entity54 , who has written seven books on @entity2 , said @entity3 's reign appears to be drawing quickly to a close			1
" he 's losing support by the hour from critical people in his regime , " he said			2
but @entity54 said it was unlikely that the next leader would emerge from the military , since @entity3 has long sought to keep the institution at arm 's length			1
" though he was an army officer when he came to power and was supported by the military and all the original members of the @entity70 were from the military , he has , from the beginning , evidenced a great distrust for the military , " @entity54 said			0
" he recognized it as the most likely power to overthrow him			0
" as a result , @entity3 has routinely rotated commanders " so no one established a base of support			1
" unlike @entity81 , who were seeking a more liberal system , @entity80 want a new system , @entity54 said			0
accomplishing that will mean " a great deal of chaos in the short term , " he predicted			0
" if he does leave , i think we 'll see the tribal leadership of @entity2 , probably through social leadership committees , trying to come up with some kind of a nonviolent solution , " he said			1
@entity54 noted that two major tribes had already withdrawn their support of @entity3			2
one of them , the @entity98 tribe , has long been a supporter			0
the other , the @entity100 , is one of the larger tribes of eastern @entity2 and is located near the terminals from where oil is exported			2
" that 's a significant loss , " he said			0
though another strongman could emerge , @entity54 predicted instead that a nationwide network of " social leadership " committees set up by @entity3 in 1993 and composed primarily of traditional leaders and tribal leaders would seek to take charge			1
@entity3 had tried without success to eliminate the more than 100 tribes in @entity2 in an effort that lasted from 1969 to 1980 , @entity54 said			1
so in 1993 , the leader made a dramatic move -- reinforcing the tribal system and recognizing its leaders as important by creating social leadership positions , @entity54 said			2
the leaders were given power at the local level as well as such " goodies " as housing and scholarships for their tribal members , he said			2
but the gifts came with a catch : " in turn , you must recognize that you 're in charge of your tribe , " @entity54 said			0
" if they step out of line , we 'll go to you			0
" if @entity3 leaves power , " those tribal leaders will try to find a way to put together some kind of a new government , " he predicted			1
" i think you 'll see the tribes being the ones that will , in the short term anyway , try to find a way through the obvious chaos that 's going to occur			2
" are you there ? share photos , video not everyone predicts rough sailing			0
@entity152 , an exiled @entity2 opposition figure who said his great - uncle was overthrown by @entity3 , predicted that any transition would go smoothly			1
" if @entity3 departs , there will be no problem , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview from @entity156			2
" there will be a national council , which would be represented by all the tribes and all the @entity80 from all different walks of life			0
" he said the opposition already has a constitution and a flag ready for use in the event of @entity3 's departure			1
" we will have a democracy , " he predicted			0
" after this experience , i do n't think they 'll allow anybody to single - handedly rule			0
" despite an exile that has lasted four decades , @entity152 said he would return to @entity2 " in a heartbeat			2
" but @entity8 's @entity6 said @entity152 and his relatives would have little hope of gaining a position of power upon their return			0
" it 's about as likely that they 'll get back in power as the @entity191 in the @entity186 , " he said , referring to the family of the former president of the @entity186 , @entity185 , who in 1986 fled a military rebellion and moved to @entity188 .			0
