residents lobbed rockets and fired bullets at one another saturday , leaving at least three people wounded , state news agency @entity14 reported			0
the city is home to both @entity17 and @entity18 , and sectarian tensions have worsened in recent months as the civil war in neighboring @entity22 rages on			0
the @entity17 support @entity22 president @entity23			0
the @entity18 want his ouster			0
the @entity4 government has remained officially neutral in the conflict -- even as it has firmly , but quietly , supported @entity23			1
and @entity3 , while a @entity18 , led that effort			1
his departure , therefore , comes at a sensitive time for @entity4			1
analysts say the longer the @entity22 conflict rages , the more destabilized @entity4 will become			1
deadlock prompts resignation @entity3 announced the resignation of his government friday after he said he could not negotiate a breakthrough on two fronts : -- preparations for the country 's june parliamentary elections -- extending the term of the head of @entity4 's internal security forces			1
the group to blame in both cases is @entity46 , a powerful @entity47 political party that has links with the @entity23 government and dominates @entity4 's government			1
in the case of election preparations , lawmakers have been unable to come to an agreement on an election law			0
in the second instance , @entity46 distrusts maj. gen. @entity57 , the security forces head			0
@entity57 , like @entity3 , is a @entity18			1
" the prime minister can not work in such conditions			0

complicated politics politics in @entity4 is complicated as it constantly struggles to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects			1
by law , the prime minister must be a @entity71 , the parliamentary speaker a @entity47 , and the president a @entity74			0
@entity3 became prime minister two years ago , after @entity46 brought down the previous unity government			1
since then , he has maintained a balance between pro- and anti-al - @entity23 factions			2
his government , says @entity80 expert @entity79 , was more interested in keeping @entity4 from getting dragged into the conflict			1
but in recent months , he has been at odds with @entity46			0
and the latest issues brought the tension to the surface			0
the @entity22 connection the major concern for @entity4 is that @entity22 's troubles will reopen the wounds of @entity4 's 15 - year - long civil war , which ended in 1990			2

this all changed in 2005 after former prime minister @entity105 was killed by a car bomb in @entity107			0
anti-al - @entity23 elements in @entity4 accused the @entity22 government of being behind the attack , and popular protests -- along with international pressure -- forced the @entity22 military to withdraw from the country			2
