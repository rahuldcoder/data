-- work hard , get promoted , succeed in your new post , and eventually you 'll start earning the big money			1
this progression seems like a firmly ingrained part of the @entity6 , and it 's certainly worked for a lot of people			0
@entity9 spent $ 6 million on office renovations , @entity12 tickets , and a @entity13 , among other expenses			1
however , these steps are n't absolutely necessary to fatten your bank account , as @entity18 ceo @entity17 learned last week			1
when @entity18 failed and was seized by government regulators , @entity17 had been on the job for just 17 days			1
however , he was contractually guaranteed $ 11.6 million in cash severance on top of the $ 7.5 million signing bonus he got for taking the job			2
basically , @entity17 netted just under $ 20 million for 17 days of work , which is a pretty nice setup for the head of a collapsing corporation			1
( in @entity17 's defense , it 's tough to blame @entity18 's failure on his leadership alone ; it seems highly unlikely that any ceo , however determined , could crash such a large thrift in just two weeks			1
) @entity17 's not the only person to reap huge rewards for relatively little work			1
here are few other well - compensated employees who did n't have to put in too many years of service : 1			2
@entity9 after co-founding @entity39 in 1975 , @entity9 quickly skyrocketed through the ranks of entertainment agents until he established himself as one of the most powerful men in @entity44			2
in 1995 , though , he left @entity39 to become president of @entity46			2
@entity9 's tenure at @entity46 was stormy ; he clashed with ceo @entity48 , who did n't share @entity9 's penchant for delegation			1
@entity9 also racked up a $ 6 million tab for various expenses ranging from renovating his office , buying @entity12 tickets , and purchasing a @entity13			1
it quickly became obvious that @entity9 was n't going to be a great fit at @entity48 's @entity46 , so the board terminated his contract after just 16 months			1
while @entity9 put in more work than @entity17 did at @entity18 , he also received a lot more cash : a severance package of stock and cash that was worth around $ 100 million at the time			1
as @entity46 's stock price rose , though , so did the value of the package ; at one point @entity9 's take might have been as much as $ 140 million for those 16 months of work			1

@entity75 critics raved about @entity78 's turn as @entity79 in this summer 's @entity80 , and most could n't help but mention that it was a marked improvement over @entity83 ' campy portrayal of @entity79 in 1995 's @entity84			2
however , @entity83 was n't the only man to portray @entity79 in that run of @entity88 films			0
@entity75 had the role of @entity79 in @entity91 's 1989 film @entity88			2
although the role was a fairly minor one in that film , @entity75 allegedly took the part with the understanding that he would reprise the character in a sequel in which two - face would be one of @entity88 's antagonists			1
to this end he had a pay - or - play clause inserted in his contract that basically assured that if the @entity79 / two - face character appeared in a future @entity106 @entity88 film , @entity75 would play the role			1
if the director chose to cast another actor in the part , the studio would have to cough up a buyout to @entity75			2
in the end , that 's exactly what happened : when @entity91 left the series ' helm , @entity117 took over and wanted to cast @entity83 in the part			0
@entity75 received a cash buyout to not be in @entity84 , a deal most of the principals in the critical disaster probably wish they 'd been offered themselves			2

@entity125 when a professional baseball player signs a new deal , he 's pretty much guaranteed to pull in the cash regardless of whether or not he plays			1
if you want proof , just mention the name @entity125 to @entity133 fans and watch as their faces contort in terror			1
after an early stint in @entity137 and three fairly strong seasons in @entity139 , @entity125 signed a four - year contract worth $ 39.95 million with the @entity133 before the 2005 season			1
the pitcher 's ill - fated tenure in the @entity145 included pretty standard baseball injuries like an elbow strain and some problems with his throwing shoulder , but he also had some booboos that made @entity133 fans wonder if he might be cursed , including two broken ribs in a car crash and a disabled - list trip for bruised buttocks			1
in all , the @entity133 shelled out that $ 39.95 million for @entity125 to make 26 starts over the four - year span			1
to make matters worse , on the rare occasions when @entity125 was healthy he was n't very good at baseball			2
his best season with the @entity133 saw him compile a 4.77 era and allow 1.47 baserunners per inning he pitched			0
even @entity164 , baseball 's other pricy - but - fragile starter , has to shake his head at those numbers			2

@entity170 while he may not be as high profile or as well - paid as the other names on this list , @entity170 may have found the sweetest deal an average guy could find			0
in a coup ripped directly from one of @entity179 's daydreams , @entity170 claimed that he did nothing for seven years while employed as a scientist at the @entity182			0
in 2003 @entity170 told the @entity183 that he had n't really been given any job responsibilities since 1996			0
prior to that , he had been a researcher and program officer on @entity187 , but he was removed from that position in 1995 for arguing with a sufferers ' support group			0
although he had a title as director of the @entity194 - @entity193 and a list of nominal duties associated with that role , @entity170 claimed that he only carried out the tiniest of tasks like ordering coffee			0
in exchange , he received a salary in the neighborhood of $ 100,000			0
when the @entity182 vehemently disputed @entity170 's story that he simply went to work and did nothing all day , he maintained that he never received any assignments			0
@entity170 would show up , sit in his office , and read to kill time			0
he took up fiction writing to fill his workdays and published a pair of novels he allegedly wrote while at the office			0
he told @entity214 in an interview that he also joined a health club near work " just to sort of break up the day			0
" the most amazing part of @entity170 's story is n't that he managed to stay employed through this seven - year period , but that he received positive performance reviews from his superiors			0
he wryly explained to @entity214 , " i guess i 'm good at doing nothing			0
