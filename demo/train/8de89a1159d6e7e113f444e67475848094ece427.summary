@entity0 , @entity1 -- the one - star general almost yells when asked to talk about the infamous @entity5 photos showing @entity7 soldiers abusing @entity1 detainees			1
an @entity1 detainee grips a fence at @entity11 , one of the few @entity7 detention centers remaining in @entity1			1
" if we had had a company commander doing what he was supposed to be doing , a battalion commander doing what he was supposed to be doing ... , " brig			0
he carried on -- growing more and more angry			0
so the next obvious question was , " it makes you angry ? " " it does make me angry , " he said			0
" because i think we lost a lot of @entity7 lives because of those photos			1
" and there it is -- the issue of detainee abuse and what the @entity7 military struggles with , and has struggled with , since the release of those photos in 2004 , some of which showed naked prisoners being humiliated , stacked in piles or subjected to mock torture			1
@entity40 , the head of detainee operations in @entity1 , is echoing a debate raging in @entity44			1
another round of photos allegedly showing further abuse of prisoners was to be released by the end of this month			1
but president @entity50 asked that the photos be held back			0
@entity50 said he believed the release of the pictures could put @entity7 lives in danger			1
that is @entity57 situation no. 1 : on one hand transparency ; on the other , the safety of @entity7 troops			2
@entity40 agreed with his commander in chief			0
" the jihadists have used those pictures			0
and it has spurred some of the violence , " he said			0
walking through @entity11 -- one of the last remaining @entity7 detention centers in @entity1 -- it is clear the damaging photos have forced the @entity7 to become more transparent in its dealings with prisoners			1
detainees are now checked before and after interrogations to ensure the guards have not abused them			0
officers who walk the catwalk , the long metal walkway that surrounds the sprawling yard housing the detainees , have more oversight			0
these institutional checks reduce the possibility that abuse could reach the same scale as it did in @entity5 in 2003			1
the camp itself has a strange feeling to it			0
visitors are told to put on sunglasses before entering some of the holding areas			0
many of the detainees spit and even throw their own fecal matter at the guards , officials said			0
inmates in @entity7 detention with arrest warrants against them will be turned over to @entity1 authorities under the terms of the @entity7 - @entity1 security agreement			1
all others will be released			0
but the @entity7 has signed the international treaty against torture , which compels a nation to keep suspects detained rather than send them to another country if that other country might ill - treat them			2
" @entity1 detention facilities are not good ; they are not like @entity7 facilities , " said a woman who had just visited her detainee husband at @entity11			1
" there is a lot of witness testimony from detainees who suffered maltreatment in @entity1 detention facilities			2
" a @entity125 report examining the second half of 2008 agreed , saying that detention centers run by @entity1 are using torture and physical abuse to extract confessions			2
the lingering questions about @entity1 detention facilities create @entity57 situation no. 2			2
the @entity7 very much wants not only to get out of @entity1 , but to get out of the detainee operation business			1
but it has a legal bar to satisfy			0
for its part , the @entity7 military said it is inspecting and monitoring nine of the @entity1 facilities where its detainees will go			1
@entity1 government authorities maintain that they are treating all prisoners in accordance with international law			2
but when the @entity7 pulls its last troops form @entity1 , the monitoring is likely to stop			1
nongovernmental organizations have been denied access , and @entity2 recently has not been allowed into any @entity1 prison .			2

@entity7 head of detainee operations in @entity1 is angered by @entity5 photos
the pictures showing abuse of @entity1 prisoners continue to cause *problems*
@entity7 military faces tough choices over future of detainees in @entity1
