-- it was a weekend that @entity2 and @entity3 will never forget			1
for @entity2 , it saw him clinch a three - shot victory at the @entity6 and climb to third in the @entity10 's @entity9 standings			1
but the @entity11 benefited from the withdrawal from the tournament of halfway leader @entity3 , who left the @entity14 in @entity15 after receiving news his wife @entity17 had gone into labor			1
@entity17 gave birth to a daughter , @entity20 , and @entity2 plans to send the newborn a gift for inadvertently aiding his sixth @entity10 win			1
" @entity20 will be getting a very nice baby gift from me , " the 32 - year - old told the @entity10 's website after finishing the tournament 16 - under par ahead of @entity28 in second place			2
" i ca n't thank @entity17 enough for going into labor early			0
i do n't know if i 'd be sitting here if she had n't			0
" but that is a way more important thing than a golf tournament			0
i missed a golf tournament when my first was born , and it was the best decision i ever made			0
i 'm sure @entity3 would say the same thing			2
" @entity2 is the reigning @entity9 champion and sunday 's win , his second of 2013 , leaves him behind compatriots @entity43 and world no. 1 @entity45 in the standings			1
" it feels great to get a win , " added @entity2			2
" to validate all the hard work i 've put in over the past three months where i have n't played my best and know that i 'm working on the right stuff and able to hold up under some pretty serious pressure this afternoon			0
" to win a tournament like this with those pivotal holes coming down the stretch means a lot			0
