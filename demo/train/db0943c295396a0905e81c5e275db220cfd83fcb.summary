-- two farms have been quarantined by the @entity3 @entity2 as the agency continues to investigate last month 's discovery of mad cow disease at a @entity8 dairy farm			1
authorities also have launched an investigation at a calf ranch where the initial infected cow was raised 10 years ago , according to a statement released late wednesday by the @entity2			2
last week , the @entity2 documented the fourth confirmed @entity3 case of @entity15 ( @entity15 ) -- a brain wasting disease affecting cattle -- known commonly as mad cow disease , at a rendering facility in central @entity8			1
@entity2 officials said the cow was never presented for human consumption and was not a threat			2
the farm where the cow was initially discovered has been under quarantine since the discovery , agriculture officials said			2
wednesday 's announcement of a second quarantine involves a farm closely associated with the dairy where the sick cow was discovered last month , the @entity2 said			2
the agency is still trying to determine if any at - risk cattle are present at either of the two farms			2
eating contaminated meat or some other animal products from cattle that have @entity15 is thought to be the cause of @entity41			0
the fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in @entity45 , where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s			1
learn more about @entity41 disease in people , symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes , movement deficits , memory disturbances and cognitive impairments			1
@entity15 can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression , difficulty in coordination and standing up , decreased milk production or weight loss			0
it is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein , which is fed to other cattle			0
in this case , the @entity68 reported that the cow had a rare form of @entity15 not likely carried by contaminated feed			2
since 2004 , the @entity2 has removed the brain and the spinal column , the parts suspected of causing mad cow disease in humans , from the food system			1
the @entity2 says that since the discovery of the infected cow , they have identified 10 different feed suppliers that delivered animal feed to the farm			0
determining if the cow became sick from feed is an area where investigators are focusing close attention			0
authorities have determined the infected cow gave birth twice			0
one calf was stillborn and the other was located on a farm outside of @entity8			1
that cow was subsequently euthanized and tested negative for mad cow disease			1
unlike most other meat - borne illnesses , such as those caused by e. - coli bacteria , cooking does not kill the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease			1
consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the web - based consumer advocacy group @entity105 , which advises the avoidance of brains , neck bones and beef cheeks , bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone			0
the group also says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store			0
" evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent @entity15 are working , as are similar actions taken by countries around the world , " said @entity119 , the @entity2 's chief veterinarian			0
last year , 29 cases of @entity15 were reported worldwide , down 99 % from the peak of 37,311 cases in 1992			0
" this is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease , " he said last month			0
the @entity2 confirmed the first case of mad cow disease in @entity3 on december 23 , 2003 , in a cow born in @entity140 , @entity136 , in april 1997 , only four months before the @entity3 and @entity136 began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed			1
a second @entity3 case was confirmed june 24 , 2005 , and a third on march 13 , 2006 .			1

the quarantined farms are in @entity8
two calves were born to the cow that tested *positive*
in people , symptoms of mad cow disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes
there are four confirmed cases of mad cow disease in the @entity3 since 2003
