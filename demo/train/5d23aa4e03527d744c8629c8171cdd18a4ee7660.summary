-- in the iconic film , " @entity9 , " @entity2 , a white lawyer defending a black man accused of attempting to rape a white woman in the @entity5 , is delivering his closing argument to an all - white - male jury : " in this country , our courts are the great levelers ... in our courts , all men are created equal , " he says			2
like the fictional defendant in the film , black @entity15 knows all too well that in this country , the promise of equal justice for all is often a hollow one			1
that is never more true than in cases where a black man or boy is killed by a non-black			0
there will be much debate in the coming days about whether the not guilty verdict in the @entity31 self - defense trial was the right or wrong outcome			1
experts will analyze the strategy , tactics and performance of the prosecutors and the defense attorneys , seeking to explain it			0
this , however , will miss the bigger and more important point : in truth , when black boys and men are killed by non-blacks , more often than not , justice will not be served			2
many black parents will try to explain to their children , especially their sons , what to make of the verdict , and they may be at a loss for words			0
how is it possible that a black child , walking where he had a right to walk , doing absolutely nothing wrong , could be pursued , confronted and ultimately shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer -- and the killer escape punishment ? @entity61 : @entity62 could have been my son @entity65 can not conceive of such a thing happening to its children , nor can it imagine that , were such a travesty to occur , the killer would escape punishment			1
but for black @entity15 , @entity70 is the latest name on a long list of @entity74 men and boys whose non-black killers escaped justice in @entity15 's courts -- a list that runs from @entity79 to @entity80 to @entity81 to @entity82			1
often , the killers are never even charged and brought to trial , which is precisely the course that the @entity31 case would have taken were it not for the protests of african - americans and others across the country			0
@entity91 : @entity31 case echoes issues of race , guns there was a time in this nation 's history , not so very long ago , when black @entity15 looked to the courts , particularly its federal courts , for justice , and received it , most notably in the area of civil rights			1
the courts , particularly the @entity105 , were places where black @entity15 's rights were validated and vindicated			2
now , our courts are places where black @entity15 's rights are often eviscerated			2
@entity74 's belief in the possibility of receiving justice from our legal system is eroded by every verdict that fails to hold a killer who is not black accountable for the death of a black man or boy			1
i was at the mall in my predominantly @entity74 - @entity74 community doing late - night shopping when the verdict was read			0
like the @entity126 store clerks who waited on me , i did not expect that @entity31 would be found guilty , but i did harbor that hope			0
@entity128 : doing what 's right not just about law now , my heart is heavy , not merely because @entity31 was acquitted , but also because we as a nation have yet to make @entity2 's words ring true			0
until we do -- until our courts are really " the great levelers " in which " all men are created equal , " african - americans killed by non-blacks will not find justice in a system that fails to demand accountability for their lost lives			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 - @entity145			0

@entity148 : justice in @entity15 often hollow , especially for blacks killed by non-blacks
she says whites ca *n't* conceive of a @entity31 - like outcome happening with their children
she says killers escaping punishment in death of *young* blacks has long history in @entity15
*writer* : every verdict that fails to hold killer of black accountable erodes black 's trust in courts
