@entity1 , 27 , joined the @entity0 - sponsored team at the start of the 2011 season , and is currently behind first - choice drivers @entity14 and @entity15 in the pecking order			1
but @entity2 team principal @entity17 raised hopes of the former @entity20 driver taking part in the inaugural @entity23 race when he said he would like to see @entity24 take to the track on october 30			1
" i 'd like him to			2
it 's up to the team to see [ whether he will ] , " @entity27 chief @entity17 told @entity28			0
veteran @entity15 signs new deal at @entity2 on the issue of which racer would make way for @entity24 , @entity17 , who recently purchased @entity37 soccer team @entity36 , suggested @entity15 would be the one to face the axe			1
" yes , i think @entity14 [ @entity14 ] is our number one driver , although @entity15 's outqualified him [ at the @entity42 @entity41 ]			1
" in response to @entity17 ' admission , @entity1 said : " it 's obviously very nice to hear			2
he 's the man who can make it happen			0
i 've just got to wait and see what he decides			0
" as a racing driver , the most emotional race is certainly your home grand prix			1
if i do get the opportunity to do it , it 'll be fantastic , but as this moment it 's a question only @entity17 can answer			0
" to be an @entity8 driver on the grid for the first @entity8 @entity41 would be magic			1
i 've been very involved in the circuit ; i 've been visiting the site every month			0
to have the opportunity to drive would sort of complete that circle			0
" @entity24 was given a drive ahead of the veteran @entity63 , who extended his contract with @entity2 last weekend , for the @entity65 @entity41 in july , where he finished in last place			1
while @entity1 admitted dropping a driver can create a difficult situation for the team , he insisted his relationship with @entity15 has been unaffected			2
" it 's not ideal , there 's no doubt about that ... i experienced it last year [ at @entity20 ] , my drive was given to @entity78 in the second half of the season			2
" when they put me in the car in @entity65 ... it 's a very difficult situation			0
but i have to say @entity15 was fantastic			0
he offered his advice and support all through the weekend			0
i have to say hats off to him , he was a model professional			0
" on his own future , @entity1 , who made his @entity5 debut at the @entity90 , made no secret of his desire to earn a full - time seat with @entity2			1
but he said any decision on his future with the team would be made by @entity17			2
" i need to sit and figure things out with @entity17 and where we are and where we see the future			0
i 'd like to stay with @entity17 , with @entity2 , and in the future race for them full - time			1
" i 'd love to race with these guys and @entity17 's got a fantastic vision of trying to build an @entity110 team and i 'd love to be a part of that programme			2
