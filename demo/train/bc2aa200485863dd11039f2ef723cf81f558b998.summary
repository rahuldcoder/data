-- it all seemed like a friday night prank in the beachfront paradise of @entity4 , the off - campus housing quarter for students from @entity7 at @entity8 and the local community college			1
the pops sounded like firecrackers , a common mischief			2
and the gun looked fake , like one used for pellet games			2
but what seemed like a college joke at first became very real			0
@entity17 saw the gunman driving by her and thought he was a hoaxster -- until she felt the whoosh of a bullet passing her skin			0
" he lifted up a little black pistol and ... i just thought it was an airsoft gun or something , so i was like , hey , what up ? " she said , becoming tearful as she recounted the experience			0
" and i turned around and i started walking the other way , " she said			0
" he shot ... i just felt the wind pass right by my face			1
" @entity17 broke down in retelling how the beauty of @entity4 became a scene of mass death friday night			1
in all , seven people were killed , including the gunman who fired into crowds while driving his black @entity44			1
it was the second time that a mass killing has occurred in the unincorporated community in 13 years ; the other one also involved a motorist			1

just 100 miles from @entity60 , @entity8 attracts weekend crowds seeking a getaway			0
its main street features boutiques and eateries in stylish spanish - mission architecture			0

pizzerias , delis , cafes and convenience stores downtown were lined with yellow police tapes zigzagging everywhere -- because the drive - by gunman apparently fired upon several places while in motion			0
bullet casings lay scattered on the street , and storefront windows were shattered			0
2001 mass killing as grisly as it was , the setting was n't the first time that @entity4 has known a mass killing , especially by a motorist			1

@entity116 was then sent to a @entity79 mental hospital			0
in friday night 's deaths , witnesses -- largely of college - student age -- initially thought the unfolding events were student antics			2
sounded like fireworks @entity130 said she was walking down the street and heard what sounded like fireworks set off by students			0
" people get stupid out here sometimes , " she said			2
but the pops were gunfire , and the car passed her , she learned			0

another witness , @entity143 , a @entity8 student , also described the bangs as fireworks			2

one woman appeared to be dead			2
another was struggling and " just barely able to move her eyes			0
" a third , wounded in the kidney and arm , was on the phone with her mother , telling her she probably was n't going to make it and " how much she loved her , " @entity155 said			1

it was heartbreaking , that something would happen in our community like this			2

other students were doing homework inside the eatery			0
