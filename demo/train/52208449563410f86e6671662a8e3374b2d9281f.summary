-- @entity1 , @entity3 's brutal @entity2 affiliate , has claimed credit for the attack by multiple gunmen at an upscale shopping mall in @entity8 , @entity9 that has already killed at least 59 people			1
this should not be a surprise			0
for @entity1 , the mall was an attractive target because @entity15 , including @entity16 , frequented it			1
the mall is also in the capital of @entity9 , a country that @entity1 has good reason to dislike , as the @entity9 military played a major role in handing their forces a defeat last year when they liberated the key @entity2 port of @entity24 from their control			1
@entity1 ( " the youth " ) tweeted saturday that " all @entity28 inside @entity29 " -- referring to the mall that was attacked in @entity8 -- " were escorted out by the @entity27 before " the armed assault commenced			1
members of @entity1 use @entity32 frequently to communicate their messages to the world			0
the group has recruited around 40 young @entity16 men and also dozens from @entity37 and has shown that it is comfortable with internet technology , despite the fact that @entity2 is one of the poorest and most anarchic countries on the planet			1
dozens killed , scores wounded , hostages taken more than 10 % of the @entity9 population is @entity28			2
so it is interesting that @entity1 took the precaution of evacuating @entity28 from the @entity8 mall they were attacking , suggesting a greater sophistication in the tactics of this attack than the group has shown hitherto in @entity2 , where they have killed large numbers of civilians indiscriminately in a country that is almost entirely @entity28			1
before he was killed by @entity60 two years ago , even @entity59 had scolded members of @entity1 , telling them to try to avoid killing @entity28 civilians			0
in a letter that was recovered in the house in @entity65 where @entity59 was killed , @entity3 's leader warned @entity1 members that they were killing too many civilians in battles in and around the key @entity69 in the @entity2 capital , @entity71			1
saturday 's attack on the @entity8 mall seems to owe some of its tactics to @entity74 , the @entity65 terrorist group that attacked upscale hotels catering to @entity15 in @entity76 , @entity77 , in november 2008 over the course of more than three days , killing 166 people			1
@entity1 grew amid @entity2 's lawlessness in both the @entity8 and @entity76 attacks , a group of armed gunmen shot at civilians indiscriminately and conducted the operation in a manner that would guarantee sustained media coverage over many hours and even days by taking a large number of hostages			1
in both assaults , the gunmen did not negotiate for the release of hostages but went into the operation seemingly prepared for a fight to the death			0
@entity1 has previously shown that it is capable of carrying out operations outside of @entity2 , bombing two groups of fans watching the @entity101 on television in @entity103 , @entity104 , on july 11 , 2010 , killing more than 70			2
the group seemed to have carried out that operation because @entity104 had provided troops to a @entity109 - authorized @entity108 mission then fighting @entity1 in @entity2			1
the group has also shown an interest in targets in the @entity15			0
eight months before the attack in @entity104 , a 28 - year - old @entity2 man armed with a knife and an ax had forced himself into the home of @entity117 -- a @entity119 cartoonist who had depicted the @entity120 with a bomb in his turban -- and tried unsuccessfully to break into the panic room where @entity124 was hiding			2
@entity119 intelligence officials said the suspect had links with @entity1			0
@entity1 has managed to plant @entity3 - like ideas into the heads of even its @entity16 recruits			1
@entity131 , an ethnic @entity2 , graduated from high school in @entity133 in 2003 , then worked pushing passengers in wheelchairs at the @entity133 airport			0
during this period @entity131 was radicalized ; the exact mechanisms of that radicalization are still murky , but in late 2007 he traveled to @entity2			0
about a year later , on october 29 , 2008 , @entity131 drove a truck loaded with explosives toward a government compound in @entity142 , northern @entity2 , blowing himself up and killing about 20 people , including @entity109 peacekeeping troops and international humanitarian assistance workers			0
the @entity146 matched @entity131 's finger , recovered at the scene , to fingerprints already on file for him			0
@entity131 was the first @entity16 terrorist suicide attacker anywhere			0
@entity1 breaks new ground with complex @entity8 attack the attack on the @entity8 mall may be an attempt by @entity1 to signal its continued relevance			1
over the past three years , @entity1 has lost substantial territory and influence in @entity2			2
@entity1 controlled much of southern @entity2 in 2010 , but operations by @entity108 and @entity9 forces have ended its domination of southern @entity2			1
in 2011 , the @entity109 - sanctioned @entity108 mission partnered with @entity2 troops to fight @entity1 militants , and in august of that year , @entity108 and @entity2 government forces defeated @entity1 forces in @entity71 , forcing the militants from a stronghold they had controlled since 2009			2
although @entity1 has long been regarded as a regional offshoot of @entity3 , its leaders only declared their formal ties to the international terror organization in february 2012			0
while the group seems to have been interested in an alliance before then , in 2010 , @entity59 instructed the group 's leaders to keep their association with @entity3 a secret , fearing that openly linking the groups would be bad for @entity1 's fundraising efforts			1
by february 2012 , however , @entity59 was dead and @entity1 had suffered significant losses in its southern @entity2 safe haven			2
@entity3 's new leader , @entity184 , who had earlier petitioned @entity59 to reconsider his views about the proposed merger between @entity1 and @entity3 , believed the time was right to announce formal ties between the two groups			0
while there are a number of @entity16 citizens fighting for a variety of @entity3 - affiliated or - inspired organizations , @entity1 seems to boast the most @entity16 fighters			2
according to a 2011 report by the @entity197 , an estimated 40 @entity16 have joined @entity1 in the last few years , at least 24 of them coming from the @entity2 community in @entity199			1
@entity1 has prominently featured these recruits in its propaganda operations , releasing three official videos that starred @entity203 ( " the father of @entity205 , the @entity16 " ) , who is actually @entity203 , in his late 20s from @entity208 , who was raised as a @entity210 and converted to @entity211 in high school			2
one of the videos shows @entity203 preparing an ambush and features @entity216 rap lyrics extolling jihad			0
@entity203 was reported to have been killed on september 12 during the course of some kind of an internal conflict within the @entity221			0
the news of his death was confirmed on @entity203 's @entity32 account four days later .			0

for @entity1 , the mall was an attractive target because @entity15 frequented it
also , it fits with the @entity2 - based terrorist group 's *enmity* with @entity9
the group has recruited around 40 @entity16 men and also dozens from @entity37
the attack on the @entity8 mall may be an attempt by @entity1 to signal its continued relevance
