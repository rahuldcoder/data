@entity0 -- the maker of a fake bomb detector that investigators say put lives at risk was sentenced thursday to 10 years in prison by a @entity0 court			1
@entity9 , 57 , marketed his @entity9 units to government agencies and private companies around the world , including in @entity14 , with sales exceeding $ 50 million by his own admission			2
however , independent tests showed the device has no better than a random chance of finding a golf ball , much less a bomb			0
@entity23 police say the device -- the @entity9 standing for " @entity26 " -- is really a novelty golf - ball finder with the label removed			2

" @entity40 was convicted last month on three counts of fraud			1
he was sentenced to 10 years on each of the counts , to run concurrently			1
half of the 10 - year term must be served before he 's eligible for release on parole , the judge said			2
while specific cases of death or injury as a result of the use of the devices ca n't be proved , their sale was a " callous confidence trick , " the judge said			1
" the jury found that you knew the devices did not work , yet the soldiers in @entity14 and elsewhere believed in them , in part due to your powers of salesmanship and in part the extravagant and fraudulent claims made in your promotional material			0
" after a six - week trial , i am wholly satisfied that your fraudulent conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent individuals			0
" explaining his decision to hand @entity40 the maximum possible sentence , the judge focused on the scale of the fraud and its potentially deadly consequences			1
@entity40 was the driving force and sole director of his company , @entity88 , and with a small number of employees sold well over 7,000 devices to the @entity14 government and other international agencies for between $ 2,500 and $ 30,000 per unit , the judge said			1
one invoice showed total sales in excess of $ 38 million to @entity14 over a period of nearly three years , he added			0
police investigators believe it cost @entity40 less than $ 60 to make each device			2
in some places , the fake detectors remain in use and are a continuing danger to life , @entity31 said			1
" soldiers , police forces , border customs officers , hotel security staff and many other users trusted their lives to the overpriced devices sold by you , which were no more than plastic components with a disconnected antenna with a capability of detecting explosives no better than random chance , " he said			0
" your profits were obscene , funding grand houses , a greedy and extravagant lifestyle and even a yacht			0
" @entity40 also has shown no remorse for his actions , the judge said			1
he made millions from the sale of the devices and used the proceeds to fund a luxurious lifestyle			1
ahead of the sentencing , a defense lawyer for @entity40 told the court that there was no evidence that vehicles carrying bombs passed through checkpoints where his devices were in use			0
@entity40 was not responsible for any attacks , his lawyer said , and any number of devices could not protect the people of @entity14			0
superintendent @entity146 , of @entity147 , told reporters outside the court that the next step for investigators would be to ensure that all the proceeds from @entity40 's criminal activities are seized			0
@entity146 described him as a shameless con - man who had personally pocketed millions of dollars from his scam			0
but it was n't just a good sales line that allowed @entity40 , over a 10 - year period , to become wealthy from a fraudulent device			2
an @entity14 general has been jailed for procuring the @entity9 through " unauthorized " channels			0
@entity23 police believe that @entity40 paid off officials to buy the @entity9 in bulk			1
@entity1 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
