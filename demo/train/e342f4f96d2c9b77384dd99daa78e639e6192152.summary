-- what happened in @entity3 's @entity2 as the light began to fade last saturday took many serious @entity6 watchers by surprise			0
not only was @entity8 released from house arrest at the very point the military regime 's containment order expired , but within a very short space of time some tens of thousands of her supporters had gathered at her gates , among them many young people who had had no exposure to her before			1
any idea that @entity8 , a @entity19 peace laureate , has been successfully sidelined in @entity6 politics by her uniformed oppressors evaporated			1
even so , harping on the occasion as a " @entity24 moment			0
" the international media provided a distorted picture			0
with some deft camera work and biased reporting it would be perfectly possible to sell a lie , say , that everyone in the @entity32 is a @entity33 football fan			0
not true , of course , just as any suggestion that the whole of the @entity6 people , except for the senior military , is squarely behind @entity8 would be a misrepresentation			1
there are those doing quite nicely under the regime , thank you very much , there are ethnic minority members whose principal dream is autonomy , not national democracy , and there are those with little or no interest in politics			2
ms. @entity8 is not about to assume the reins of government			1
even so , it has become obvious that , politically , @entity8 does still command perhaps a greater following inside @entity6 than any other person or entity , whatever the outcome of the sham elections conducted a week earlier			1
so the question is , what will she do with such momentum behind her ? the only certainty is she must tread carefully			0
while rebuilding her badly fractured party , the @entity64 , may seem a priority , how she goes about it could decide whether or not she remains at liberty			0
any idea that the @entity69 ( the military junta 's formal title ) is running out of steam is misbegotten			1
senior general @entity73 and his colleagues have , over the last few years , expended enormous energy shoring up their position -- promulgating a new constitution and choreographing the first elections in 20 years as well as building themselves a brand new and secure capital at @entity81			0
the generals and the generals alone hold all the actual power			0
should @entity8 resume where she left off in 2003 and campaign against the regime , addressing mass rallies up and down the country , then the generals ' patience will snap , and the gates of her lakeside villa will once again be locked			1
or something worse could occur			0
conversely , if @entity8 , once she has recuperated her physical strength , does not return to the hustings , then that would seem to some like moral cowardice , as she would be the first to admit			1
there is perhaps another way			0
to remain at liberty and to stand any chance of effecting real change within @entity6 ( something she has singularly failed to do thus far ) , @entity8 might be well advised to step back from the cut - and - thrust of daily politics and begin taking on the role of eminence grise , for which her personality is well suited			1
let others rebuild the @entity64 ( if such is to be permitted ) while she operates as an intermediary between all the parties concerned , including the " international community " and the junta itself			2
critics of this view will say that while @entity8 has always sought dialogue with the generals , they have never wanted to talk to her			1
but i suspect there may have been a meaningful sea change			2
everything revolves around the trade sanctions imposed on @entity6 by the @entity125 and the @entity126 ( including @entity32 , the former colonial power )			0
sanctions have failed , driving the junta into the arms of @entity131			2
the generals , however , would rather be beholden to no one at all , @entity134 or @entity135 , and they will be aware that @entity8 has revised her opinions , to the chagrin of some activists			2
whereas when sanctions were introduced in the 1990s she countenanced them , now it seems , from recent statements she has made , she has swung to the view that sanctions hurt the ordinary people of @entity6 far more than their rulers			0
could it be that the room for maneuvering improbably extended to @entity8 at the present time is tied to this ? if anyone could persuade the @entity135 to drop sanctions , then that person is @entity8			1
and , on the premise that politics follow economics , that would be good news indeed			0
a more prosperous @entity6 achieved through inward investment and all the values that come with that could also be a @entity6 where actual social and political change finally becomes a possibility			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			2

@entity165 says *excitement* over @entity8 release shows her political potency
the military junta likely will limit her , he says , but she can use her sway to influence change
he says she should step back from activist politics and help *broker* end to sanctions
@entity181 : her help in ending sanctions could *foster* *climate* for real political change
