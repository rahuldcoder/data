they do n't call journalists ' hacks ' for nothing			0
at large news agencies where speed is crucial , template - style stories have long been used for company results , allowing journalists to simply key in the relevant facts and numbers and fire off the dispatch			1
often disparagingly referred to as ' churnalism , ' some of the larger media organisations -- including the @entity14 and @entity15 -- have now turned to robots to take the grind out of formulaic dispatches			1
the @entity14 uses the algorithms in its in - house software -- called @entity22 - to produce reports on local earthquakes , using data provided by the @entity26			1
the reports typically hit the newspaper 's website within three minutes of the tremor being recorded			1
for data - rich stories such as finance stories , sports stories and breaking news where dry facts need to be collated and sent out quickly , robo - journalists are becoming increasingly common			1
narrative science , a @entity38 company set up in 2010 to commercialize technology developed at @entity41 that crunches data into a narrative , markets its quill software to television stations and to financial houses that generate earnings statements			1
" a lot of people felt threatened by what we were doing , and we got a lot of coverage , " narrative science ceo @entity54 told @entity55			0
" it led to a lot of inquiries from all different industries and to the evolution to a different business			0
" read this : will nanotechnology soon allow you to ' swallow the doctor ? ' its algorithms now write up lengthy reports on the performance of mutual funds for the consumption of investors and regulators			1
" it goes from the job of a small army of people over weeks to just a few seconds , " @entity54 said			0
" we do 10 - to 15 - page documents for some financial clients			2
" while the prose can seem stilted , chief scientist at the company @entity80 says the algorithm is growing in complexity			2
" we know how to introduce an idea , how not to repeat ourselves , how to get shorter , " he said			0
writing in the nuances can simply be a matter of setting the software 's parameters : a devastating loss for a sports team can be written in a sympathetic style for the team 's home audience while regulatory filings can be as exhaustive and granular as required for the client			1
known as ' natural language generation ' , the company -- which does not reveal exactly how its software operates - is tapping into years of research into how software can write in language that responds not just to the data but its context and its relevance			1
@entity80 , meanwhile , believes it is only a matter of time before a robo - journalist will write a @entity112 winning story as the software grows in sophistication			1
he said there is no reason for the algorithms to move from commodity news , to narrative journalism to complex long - form features			1
asked whether a computer would win a @entity112 within 20 years , he disagreed saying it would happen within five years			1
" humans are unbelievably rich and complex , but they are machines , " @entity80 told @entity123			2
" in 20 years , there will be no area in which @entity129 does n't write stories			1
" while media organizations that use bots to crunch data say the software is merely an adjunct to the journalist 's work , and will never replace them , some commentators believe that mapping the way forward for artificial intelligence will be one of the most urgent tasks of the 21st century			1
professor @entity143 , @entity144 historian and author of @entity146 : a @entity147 , believes it is not just journalism that is being challenged by machines			2
" the conscious experiences of a flesh - and - blood taxi driver are infinitely richer than those of @entity155 's self - driving car , which feels nothing , " @entity143 told @entity1			2
" but what the system needs from a taxi driver is to bring passengers from point a to point @entity162 as quickly , safely and cheaply as possible			0
" @entity155 's self - driving car will soon be able to do that far better than a human driver			2
the same goes for mechanics , lawyers , soldiers , doctors , teachers -- and even computer engineers			2
" read this : in a hurry ? let a robot valet park your car he said that while machines may have replaced humans for the past 200 years since the @entity180 , there has always been something that humans could do better than machines			2
however , he said that this gap is likely to close over the next 100 years			0
" ( since the @entity180 ) humans have focused more on performing cognitive tasks			0
but what will happen once computerized algorithms can outperform humans in that ( area ) too ? some believe that artificial intelligence should be viewed as a threat to the human race			0
@entity196 philosopher and transhumanist @entity195 is convinced that humanity will end up being " the biological boot loader for superintelligent @entity200 "			0
@entity201 , the superstar entrepreneur who founded @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 , echoed this warning via his @entity207 feed : " the idea that humans will always have a unique ability beyond the reach of non-conscious algorithms is just wishful thinking			0
it is based on the traditional assumption that intelligence and consciousness are inextricably linked to one another			0
for millions of years of evolution , this may have been true			0
but no longer , " says @entity143			0

software with increasingly complex algorithms are now writing news stories and financial reports
the @entity14 uses @entity22 to write about tremors , using data from the @entity26 .
@entity38 - based company @entity129 markets its quill software to media and financial houses
the company 's chief scientists believes a computer *program* could win a @entity112 within the next 5 years
