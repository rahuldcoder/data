@entity1 , @entity0 -- on march 30 the @entity4 treaty went into effect , liberalizing air travel between the @entity7 and @entity8			1
but how will the ease of restrictions on transatlantic routes affect business travelers ? under @entity4 , @entity14 and @entity7 airlines will be given unlimited access between @entity8 and @entity7 points			1
the treaty puts an end to the exclusive arrangement granted to @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 to fly transatlantic out of @entity24			1
but with the airport currently operating at almost - maximum capacity , new flights will be severely limited			2
as a result competition is fierce for @entity24 slots , with airlines paying as much as $ 60 million to get their hands on them			2
for each flight that is added , another less lucrative service is scrapped			0
airlines are giving priority to high - yield business routes to and from @entity24			2
while @entity14 carriers are now allowed to fly from any point within @entity41 across the @entity42 , the @entity7 domestic market remains closed to them			0
operators in @entity8 hope that a second phase of the @entity4 deal will mean a relaxation of restrictions on @entity14 airlines ' investment in @entity7 carriers and the ability for @entity14 airlines to compete in the @entity7 domestic market			2
the issue is pending in @entity55			0
if the @entity7 does n't deliver , there is a clause in the agreement that states the @entity4 treaty -- phase i included -- can be torn up			0
industry experts foresee some fare wars in both economy and business - class			0
service options are also likely to improve as competition intensifies			0
@entity7 airlines will vie with @entity20 , the dominant carrier at @entity24 , that currently has flights to 24 @entity7 cities			1
the biggest challenge to the incumbent airlines operating out of @entity24 will come from carriers in the @entity75 alliance , that includes @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80			1
before @entity4 , the @entity75 alliance offered no transatlantic routes to and from @entity24			1
by summer they will offer 10 percent of these flights			0
@entity75 carriers will be located for the first time in @entity86			2
given the size of the market for @entity7 - @entity24 flights , airlines will continue to offer services from @entity92 , @entity24 's second - busiest airport			1
open skies will intensify competition for ailing @entity7 airlines on what has been their most profitable route			0
analysts expect to see consolidation between @entity7 airlines as they combine international networks to beat competition			0
one advantage @entity7 airlines can offer is opportunity for connecting flights to other @entity14 cities as well as on to @entity105 and the @entity106			0
@entity14 carriers on the other hand , can not operate domestic flights within the @entity7 new flights and new airlines @entity112 @entity20 will shift its @entity114 and @entity115 services from @entity92 to @entity24 and its @entity117 operation to @entity92			1
flights to @entity119 and @entity120 will be axed			0
in june , the airline will also launch services between @entity8 and @entity123			1
operated by subsidiary @entity125 , the daily flights will fly from either @entity126 or @entity127 to @entity128 or @entity129 using @entity130 757s from its existing fleet			0
in the future , @entity125 plans to fly to other business centers , including @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140			0
@entity20 will also commence business - only flights between @entity123 and @entity142 next year using @entity144 jets in a 32 - seat layout			1

slots were secured as a result of @entity76 ditching four daily rotations from @entity24 to @entity129 @entity129 and @entity77 dropping three of its slots to @entity79 from @entity167 and @entity168			1
@entity170 airlines @entity171 launched services from @entity173 to @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 last year			2
this followed agreement between the @entity180 and @entity7 governments that the airline could begin operations before others			0
low - cost airline @entity184 is considering setting up a separate long - haul carrier that would fly ultra-low - fares between secondary airports in @entity8 and @entity7 such as @entity188 and @entity190 - @entity189			2
@entity21 has decided to wait to see if @entity191 is adopted before starting new flights to @entity123 from @entity194 cities			1
