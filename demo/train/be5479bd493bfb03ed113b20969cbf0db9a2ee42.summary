-- lawmakers in @entity3 moved friday to ban @entity4 from adopting @entity6 children , passing a bill that imposes a series of sanctions on @entity4 interests , state media reported			1
@entity6 is one of the top countries of origin for international adoptions in the @entity4			2
the @entity18 , @entity6 's lower house of parliament , adopted the bill on its third reading , the state - run @entity16 news agency reported			1

it also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the @entity4 , if such activities may affect @entity6 interests , the news agency said , and imposes sanctions against @entity4 officials thought to have violated human rights			1
the move by @entity6 politicians is widely seen as retaliation for a law that @entity4 president @entity44 signed december 14			1
that bill , called the @entity46 , imposes @entity4 travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in @entity6			1
" the @entity4 is concerned by measures in the bill passed in the @entity18 today that , if it becomes law , would halt inter-country adoptions between the @entity4 and @entity6 and would restrict the ability of @entity6 civil society organizations to work with @entity4 partners , " @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said			1
the @entity61 act is named in honor of @entity6 lawyer @entity63 , who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country 's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state			2
@entity63 died in 2009 after a year in a @entity3 detention center , apparently beaten to death			0
@entity6 leaders have criticized the bill , which also places sanctions on those involved in the tax fraud @entity63 uncovered and those responsible for his detention , abuse , and death			0
the bill passed by the @entity18 is named in turn after @entity83 , a 2 - year - old boy who died while in the care of a @entity4 adoptive family , @entity16 said			1
its implementation would nullify a recent agreement between the @entity4 and @entity6 in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in inter-country adoptions			2
" @entity4 families have welcomed more than 60,000 @entity6 children into @entity4 homes over the past 20 years , " @entity50 said			2
" just last month we implemented a bilateral adoptions agreement with @entity6 to improve safeguards for adopted children and their families			0
if @entity6 officials have concerns about the implementation of this agreement , we stand ready to work with them to improve it and remain committed to supporting inter-country adoptions between our two countries			0
" only @entity107 has more adoptions to the @entity4 than @entity6			0
backers of the @entity6 bill said @entity4 adoptive parents have been abusive , citing 19 deaths of @entity6 children by their adoptive parents since the 1990s , according to local media			1
in 2010 , an @entity4 woman caused outrage after she sent her adopted son back to @entity6 alone on a one - way flight , saying the boy , then 7 , had violent episodes that made the family fear for its safety			0
@entity124 called on @entity6 lawmakers thursday to reject their measure , which it said would " have a chilling effect on human rights defenders and civil society " and end adoptions to the @entity4			2
" there is a huge risk that the vaguely worded provisions in this bill will be used to clamp down on government critics and exposers of abuses			0
indeed this would appear to be its real purpose , " said @entity139 , @entity124 's @entity140 and @entity142 program director			0
" this bill is frankly a childish response to the @entity46 , " he said			0
" the @entity18 should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen @entity6 civil society and not weaken it			0
" @entity0 's @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
