" while admitting that his behavior toward women was inappropriate at times , he insisted that he " never sexually harassed anyone			0
" did @entity0 mayor target victims of military sexual assault ? in the process of " trying to establish personal relationships , " the mayor explained , " the combination of awkwardness and hubris , i think , led to behavior that many found offensive			0
" he added , " not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court			0
" " but the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob , " @entity2 said , criticizing an environment in which " rumors become allegations , allegations become facts , facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall			2
" blasting politicians and members of the media who " unleashed a monster , " the mayor said , " the hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo			0
