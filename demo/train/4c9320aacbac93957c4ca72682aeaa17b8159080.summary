-- in @entity2 , and other @entity4 countries , it 's called " aguinaldo " -- the term used for the bonus government and private sector workers receive this time of the year , their right by law			1
the aguinaldo is equivalent to one month 's salary			0
in other words , workers who are eligible for this benefit get twice as much money in december as they do during each of the other 11 months of the year			2
the problem is that criminal extortion gangs know this and are increasingly demanding their share of this @entity23 bonus			1
frequent victims include city bus drivers who also get their aguinaldo			1
for them , extortion gangs become the @entity28 who steals @entity23 , and the choice they give bus drivers is harsh : either pay up or we will kill you			1
@entity34 , a representative for the @entity35 in @entity36 , said the extortion attempts even go beyond @entity23			2
" the gangs demand a @entity23 bonus			1
they also demand a summer bonus			0
around @entity43 , they also want a bonus for leisure travel , " @entity34 told @entity0			0
according to the @entity35 , so far this year 87 bus drivers have been murdered by criminal gangs , who extort drivers in exchange for safe passage on specific routes			1
drivers who refuse to pay face deadly consequences			2
authorities say riders who take buses to go shopping are also likely to be robbed			0
victims include workers who also receive their @entity23 bonus			1
the criminals know this and board the buses with the intention of robbing them or stealing @entity23 gifts they have just bought for their families			2
@entity70 , president of the @entity36 and @entity71 , said the trend is alarming			0
" so far this year , when you count robberies and direct attacks , there have been 44 riders of mass transit murdered and 78 injured in these kind of violent incidents , " @entity73 said			0
violence in @entity2 is nothing new			0
the @entity85 nation lived endured a civil war between 1960 and 1996 that left as many as 200,000 people killed or missing , according to some estimates			0
more recently , members of criminal gangs who were deported from the @entity93 and criminals associated with @entity96 drug cartels have terrorized the country			1
in an international travel alert published last month , the @entity93 @entity98 said that in @entity2 " violent crime is a serious concern due to endemic poverty , an abundance of weapons , a legacy of societal violence , and weak law enforcement and judicial systems			1
" this wave of crime affects many other people who are not necessarily directly victimized by the criminal gangs			1
every time a bus driver is killed , @entity73 says , up to a quarter of a million riders are affected due to cancellations in service			0
@entity2 authorities say they 're taking these developments seriously , arresting many of the gangs behind the extortion schemes			2
@entity121 as @entity122 , an investigator with the @entity123 who specializes in solving extortion cases , says so far this year they have put 24 criminal gangs out of business with the arrest of 250 suspects			1
in his investigations , @entity122 has noticed a puzzling new trend : " interestingly enough , in this type of crime 80 % of the perpetrators are women			0
it 's a phenomenon that we 're paying close attention to			0
" @entity122 believes those women are following orders from , and acting as messengers for , male gang leaders who have already been arrested and are extorting people from behind bars -- transforming a season of joy into a time of sorrow for their victims .			0
