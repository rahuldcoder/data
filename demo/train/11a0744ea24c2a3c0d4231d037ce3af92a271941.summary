he was a beefy 5 - foot - 10 but won an @entity1 for playing the slight , 5 - foot - 3 @entity2			2
he had the booming voice of a deity but often played schlubs and conflicted characters			2
he could be heartfelt and giving , as with his male nurse in " @entity8 " or rock critic in " @entity10 , " or creepily machiavellian , such as the gamemaster in the latest " @entity13 " movie			2
@entity14 was an actor who could be anybody			1
" i do n't know how he does it , " director @entity15 told the @entity16 in 2008			2
@entity17 directed @entity14 on both stage ( " @entity20 , " " @entity21 " ) and screen ( " @entity22 " )			1
" again and again , he can truly become someone i 've not seen before but can still instantly recognize			2
... he may look like @entity14 , but there 's something different in his eyes			1
and that means he 's reconstituted himself from within , willfully rearranging his molecules to become another human being			2
" " @entity14 's precise , uncanny performance as @entity2 does n't imitate the author so much as channel him , as a man whose peculiarities mask great intelligence and deep wounds , " wrote @entity32 about 2005 's " @entity2			1
" @entity14 was found dead sunday			1
reports attribute his death to a drug overdose			1
for years , @entity14 was the kind of anonymous character actor who earned critical raves but was often unnoticed by the general public			1
he had an @entity45 face -- burly enough to be an athlete , soft enough to be an artist , with an eye twinkle that could be either vicious ( as in his " @entity51 " villain ) or humorous ( the frat - boyish @entity52 in " @entity54 " )			1
consider the roles that earned him @entity1 nominations : a conniving writer ( " @entity2 " ) , a cranky @entity59 desk jockey ( " @entity22 " ) , an upbeat , dissembling priest ( " @entity61 " ) and a charming , enigmatic cult leader ( " @entity63 " )			2
or consider the ones that did n't : baseball manager @entity65 ( " @entity66 " ) , suspicious @entity67 ( " @entity68 " ) , clever @entity69 ( " @entity70 " )			2
the @entity16 ' @entity71 , who saw him on stage , was unequivocal			2
" one of the finest actors of his generation , " he wrote in his review of the 2012 staging of " @entity21 " -- even while finding @entity14 miscast in that production			1
one of a kind everyman : he 's of a type harder to find in @entity82 these days , where movie - star looks and charisma often take precedence over the ability to disappear into a role			1
indeed , even when movie stars do try to disappear , we 're all too aware of the tricks , whether it 's weight gain , a putty nose or an unfamiliar accent			1
character actors -- and @entity14 , for all his intensity , was a character actor -- support movie stars			1
that seemed ok with him			0
you could more often find him in challenging roles or secondary parts than leads			0
he liked to take chances			0
he worked with director @entity106 ( " @entity107 , " " @entity8 , " " @entity63 " ) before either was a big name , and @entity106 provided him with a steady stream of interesting roles			0
he took small parts in such films as the dark comedy " @entity122 , " based on the unpleasant characters dreamed up by @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , and " @entity123 , " @entity119 ' comedy about religion and atheism			0
in some respects he followed the path of one of his heroes , @entity126 , who had looks and magnetism to burn but was n't shy about taking " character " parts , such as a broken - down lawyer in " @entity132 " or a ne'er - do - well in " @entity133			0
" the latter featured @entity126 acting opposite @entity14 , as did the @entity137 miniseries " @entity138			1
" he also kept his talent sharp with frequent stage work and the kind of " one for me , one for them " movie philosophy that made sure he was both busy and successful			0
the price of fame : in recent years , he 'd become a more recognizable face -- and persona			1
in a video that quickly made the rounds , his voice was dubbed into a trailer for the @entity154 movie " her , " taking the place of @entity158 's operating system , @entity159			0
where @entity158 is relaxed , @entity14 is intense ; where @entity158 is helpful , @entity14 is wily			1
it neatly summed up his capabilities			0
but with fame comes intrusion , and @entity14 seemed uncomfortable with the attention			1
he was a @entity167 - based actor , not a movie star			2
it was a job , not an excuse to turn him into an open book			0
" somebody wanted me to talk about my personal life , " he told the @entity173 newspaper @entity172 in 2012			0
" i 'd rather not because my family does n't have any choice			0
if i talk about them in the press , i 'm giving them no choice			0
so i choose not to			0
" his death has left his colleagues in shock			0
" we have lost a true artist , " said @entity185 in a statement			0
@entity185 worked with @entity14 in " @entity66 " and the forthcoming " @entity189			1
" " he was a giant talent , " said @entity190 , who co-starred with @entity14 in " @entity22			1
" but perhaps director @entity17 was most succinct -- and heartfelt -- in describing the void left by @entity14 's death			1
" no words for this , " he said in a statement			0
" he was too great and we 're too shattered			0
" " @entity201 " is an all - too - appropriate word , as @entity14 himself used it when expressing his goals			1
given his work and the circumstances of his death , a line from the 2008 @entity16 profile seems more haunting today			0
" for me , acting is torturous , and it 's torturous because you know it 's a beautiful thing , " he said			0
" i was young once , and i said , ' that 's beautiful and i want that			0
' wanting it is easy , but trying to be great -- well , that 's absolutely torturous			2

@entity14 was a rare breed in @entity82
the actor could disappear into -- and *transcend* -- any role
he seemed to care more for his craft than celebrity
@entity14 died of an apparent drug overdose at the age of *46*
