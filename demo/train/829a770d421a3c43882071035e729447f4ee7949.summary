-- we should all be so lucky to have friends like @entity3 and @entity4			1
private detectives in modern - day @entity7 , they 're the stars of best - selling author @entity10 ' award - winning series of crime novels			1
@entity3 and @entity4 have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987 's " @entity14			1
" the books are international bestsellers , published in 42 countries , and have developed a fervent following			2
in " taken , " @entity10 's newest novel , his 15th featuring the daring duo , @entity3 and @entity4 take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores			1
they are bandits who prey on other bandits along the @entity28 - @entity27 border , dealing in drugs , murder and kidnapping			2
" taken " is intense and fast - paced and reads like a big - budget @entity33 blockbuster			1
though that 's not surprising when you consider @entity10 began his career writing for television series like " @entity39 , " " @entity40 " and " @entity41			1
" @entity0 recently spoke to the author about his new book , his loyal fans and why he 's refused to bring @entity3 and @entity4 to the big screen			1
the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : how has writing about @entity3 and @entity4 changed over the course of the series ? @entity10 : i really strive to bring something new to each book			1
i do n't want to write the same book over and over again			2
i 've done @entity3 books ; i 've done @entity4 books ; i 've done mixed books , but this time , i made a conscious decision i wanted to tell a story where i could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50 - 50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles			1
when i discovered this particular story , it just seemed a perfect way to do that			2
part of the book , they 're working together			2
then there 's @entity3 ' track through the story , and there 's @entity4 track , where he 's trying to find @entity3 and save him			1
so it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage			2
@entity0 : in " taken , " the story jumps between several points of view and moves back and forth in time			2
how difficult was it to put together ? @entity10 : it was like a crazy puzzle that kept changing			1
you should have seen my office			2
i have these huge black foam boards on the wall , and tacked to them , i have these white punch cards with my story ideas , scenes and notes			2
i kept juggling these cards and amending them , making little scrawls on them			0
notions came to me , things changed , and i literally shuffled them around like a deck of cards , trying to bring them all into focus so the events were as exciting as i could make them			0
@entity0 : how do you start a novel ? what comes first , an idea , an image , a scene ? @entity10 : it could be any of the above , but it 's usually an image , almost always driven by a character moment			1
in " taken , " it was the notion of @entity117 and her hunger to know more about her mother 's experience that night in the desert			0
it was literally my first image in the book			0
i saw her staring out into the black desert sky with this open - eyed wonder , trying to see the path her mother took to get to this country			2
all i had was her face in the moonlight , staring out there , and i just knew whatever she 's looking for , i want to find			0
that was the engine that really kicked off the rest of the book			0
@entity0 : " taken " revolves around a kidnapping on the @entity28 - @entity27 border by bajadores			2
what prompted you to write about these bandits ? @entity10 : i had heard about these atrocious mass graves uncovered in @entity27 south of the border : 52 people in one grave , 87 people in another , 164 bodies at a ranch with multiple burial sites			1
if you watch the news at all , you know @entity27 is pretty much defining itself now as a war between the government and the various drug cartels			0
@entity159 is fairly well - patrolled by armed groups of thugs who work for the cartels , and those guys end up preying on civilians , policemen and government officials , but they also prey on each other			2
i found out most of the people who were found in those mass graves were immigrants who were headed @entity171 from as far away as @entity172			0
they were trying to get to the @entity28 , and somewhere along the way , cartel bandits or " bajadores " would kidnap them , rob them , force them to call their families or employers or whoever and try to extort additional money out of them			0
when there was no more money to be had , they would just be murdered and buried in mass graves			0
the business was literally stealing people			0
the nature of this victim was very moving to me			0
when you consider that the victim is basically an innocent , penniless person who 's just trying to find a way to make his or her life better was super appealing to me , and it seemed like the type of people that @entity3 and @entity4 would sympathize with and risk their lives to try and save			1
@entity0 : while there 's lots of action in your books , it seems like the friendship between @entity3 and @entity4 is what keeps readers coming back			1
the books are about @entity3 and @entity4			1
the books are about their friendship and who they are as men and human beings			0
i think that 's why the readership has grown the way it has and why readers keep coming back to them			0
there 's a value to their friendship that i think people admire and envy and want in their own lives			0
i know i do , so i kind of attribute it to other people , too			0
i would love to have either @entity3 or @entity4 , preferably both , as my friends			1
they 're certainly interesting guys , and we can live vicariously through them for their adventures , but there 's something beautiful about these two guys and about having someone so trustworthy and dependable in your life			0
it 's very comforting , i think			0
@entity0 : has the success of the series surpassed your expectations ? @entity10 : i 'm certainly thrilled by the reaction			1
honestly , i never would have thought the characters would have become as popular as they have			2
in the beginning , my dream was simply to make a living at it			0
i wanted to be a writer			0
i wanted to earn a living , but it never occurred to me that the books would become bestsellers			0
i mean , i 'm glad , but none of this was by design			0
i wrote these guys because they 're guys i wanted to spend time with			0
writing a book is a long and difficult process for me			0
i 'm a slow writer , so i spend the year with @entity3 and @entity4 in my head			1
i was thinking about this the other day			0
i wrote the first book in 1987			2
literally every day since that time , @entity3 and @entity4 have been in my head			1
i started these guys because i like them			0
i still like spending time with them , and i think that 's probably the reason the readers have embraced @entity3 and @entity4 the way they have			1
whenever there 's a new book , they want to refresh that friendship			0
@entity0 : despite many lucrative offers , you 've never sold the screen rights to @entity3 and @entity4			1
why is that ? @entity10 : it 's pretty simple			1
you know the old saying , if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it ? i 'm concerned that if there 's a film of @entity3 and @entity4 , that somehow it will interfere with the collaboration i have with my readers			1
i 'm the first to admit this is probably a knuckleheaded fear on my part , but i have it nevertheless			0
books are a collaborative art. @entity3 and @entity4 do n't exist until someone picks up one of the books and reads it			1
in the act of reading , you and i collaborate , and @entity3 and @entity4 come to life inside your head			1
what i 've learned over time is that the @entity3 and @entity4 you see and hear in your head , they are only yours			1
there might be however many hundreds of thousands of other people who 've read " taken , " and each and every one of them is going to have a unique @entity3 and @entity4			1
it 's going to be a little bit different from everybody else 's because we all bring our own stuff to this			0
to me , that is the great thing about books , and i guess part of me is a little scared that if i let @entity33 get involved , and even if there 's a really good movie made , that somehow once you 've seen the film , when you come back to the new book next year , that collaboration that you and i have is going to be a little bit different			1
because then , the movie is going to have inserted itself			0
so i 'm really jealous and guarded about that			0
i want your @entity3 and @entity4 to be a product of yours and mine and nothing else			1
