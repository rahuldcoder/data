@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's opposition fighters launched an assault on one of @entity8 's last bastions of support on saturday , but they met stiff resistance and some even pulled back , military commanders said the fighting raged after negotiators failed to work out a deal to surrender the city of @entity0 , a hardcore @entity8 stronghold southeast of @entity17			1
fighters believe key members of the ousted @entity1 leader 's regime -- including two of @entity8 's sons -- may be hiding			1
positioned on the outskirts of the city , grad rockets and bullets targeted the advancing fighters , some of whom retreated			1
others worked to position themselves in advantageous locations			0
planes were heard overhead and fighters assumed they were @entity36 jets because no other aircraft has been allowed in the no - fly zone established by international powers			0
the @entity40 , @entity1 's new leadership , said it wanted to negotiate the surrender to prevent further bloodshed and destruction , though critics believe it would give @entity8 's fighters time to entrench themselves within the town			1
opposition forces claim @entity8 loyalists fired on them friday , hours ahead of a saturday deadline to lay down their arms			1
" the deadline expired yesterday when they fired at our forces with grad rockets , " ntc chief negotiator @entity56 told @entity2			1
@entity56 said he expects opposition forces to take the town soon but acknowledged the tough resistance by snipers positioned in houses and loyalist forces firing artillery and rockets			1
opposition forces have been staging outside the town for nearly two weeks , surrounding it on three sides , while negotiations were under way			2
shortly before the saturday deadline expired , @entity40 spokesman @entity72 @entity71 said absent a resolution " it 's up to military planners to decide how to move forward			1
" sticking points in the negotiation included the demand by @entity78 for opposition fighters to enter their communities unarmed , and to refrain from searching houses , @entity71 said			1
the loyalists also asked for blanket pardons , but the @entity40 wanted to prosecute loyalists with blood on their hands , @entity71 said			0
@entity0 is one of three major towns in @entity1 that remain loyal to @entity8			1
the other towns are @entity90 , on the @entity92 coast , and @entity93 , in the southwest of the country			2
opposition forces do n't know how many @entity8 loyalists are in @entity0 , though they believe they are heavily armed with machine guns and rockets , said @entity100 , an @entity40 spokesman			1
the @entity40 has previously said it had confirmed reports that two of @entity8 's sons -- @entity104 and @entity105 -- were seen inside @entity0			1
@entity104 , who was once viewed as @entity8 's possible successor , is wanted along with his father , for crimes against humanity for a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters			2
@entity105 , a defender of his father , served as @entity8 's national security adviser			2
@entity71 also said he received intelligence reports that loyalist forces were moving captured @entity40 fighters to @entity116 for use as human shields			2
that town is 10 miles east of @entity90			2
loyalists and opposition forces clashed about 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) outside of @entity90 , said @entity123 spokesman @entity122			1
@entity2 can not independently verify the reports			0
the renewed fighting came as @entity126 issued @entity128 arrest warrants friday for @entity8 , who is wanted by the @entity129 in the @entity130 for alleged crimes against humanity			1
a red notice allows @entity126 , the international police agency , to circulate arrest warrants widely with an intention to extradite suspects to the @entity129			0
at the @entity138 , @entity136 , the secretary - general 's special envoy to @entity1 , told reporters that fears of a humanitarian disaster within the capital city have not materialized			0
@entity17 's infrastructure has suffered little damage , the disruption of the water supply has been largely alleviated , supplies of fuel and electricity are improving , schools are slated to reopen september 17 , and there has been no general breakdown of public order , said @entity136 , who had earlier briefed the @entity154 after his return from five days in @entity1			0
" that 's quite a striking conflict with other post-conflict " cities , he said			0
but those advances do not minimize the enormous challenges that transitional authorities still face			0
a @entity163 has been established in @entity17 to bring all armed elements under a single command , but " the proliferation of weapons is a major concern , including to @entity1 's neighbors , " @entity136 said			0
" the approach they 're taking is to , at this stage , tell the very top echelon of the military , the police , the civil service , to remain at home while decisions are taken as to which of them should or should not be part of the future , " he said			0
despite appeals by @entity40 leaders , acts of revenge have been carried out , " especially of @entity187 accused -- often , i think , quite wrongly -- of having fought for the @entity8 regime , " he said			2
in addition , " terrible evidence continues to come to light of the deliberate human rights abuses and crimes of the @entity8 regime , both those that took place over many years and during the fall of @entity17 , when many of the prisoners were massacred , " @entity136 said			2
meanwhile , an interim government is to be established within 30 days of the declaration of liberation , @entity138 envoy @entity136 said			0
until then , the @entity40 is assuming " caretaker responsibilities " to carry out urgently needed functions , he added			0
@entity138 secretary - general @entity205 has proposed a support mission for three months , after which " we would then go back to the @entity154 for a longer mandate , " @entity136 said			0
@entity2 's @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
