@entity0 -- the skirmish between @entity3 over @entity4 , an island in the disputed zone between the two sides , has brought new danger to a standoff that has been escalating for more than two years			0
it happened just two days after @entity10 revealed a sophisticated uranium enrichment program to three @entity13 visitors from @entity14 , and in the midst of its leadership transition from @entity18 to his son , @entity19			1
how can the international community respond in a way that will deter @entity10 without pushing the situation into all - out war ? none of the options is particularly attractive : strong sanctions and displays of force have already been tried , and failed to stop the latest attack			1
military retaliation could easily escalate into war involving the @entity32 , the @entity13 and possibly @entity33 , with devastating consequences			0
negotiations , many would argue , have failed , too			0
but among the available options , a return to negotiation seems the least bad one			1
this would not be " rewarding bad behavior , " but trying to test @entity10 to see what it would take to bring us back from the brink of war			1
negotiation would have to be pursued multilaterally -- most likely through the @entity47 among the @entity32 , the @entity13 , @entity33 , @entity48 and @entity49 -- or perhaps even more importantly , bilaterally between the @entity13 and @entity10			2
it is never possible to be sure what is going on within the @entity10 regime , but its growing belligerence -- through nuclear tests , military muscle - flexing , and the demonstration of nuclear capacity to foreign visitors -- suggests that @entity10 is trying to show the world it is a force to be reckoned with			1
@entity62 has made it known that it wants to be accepted as a nuclear weapons state and wants to deal with the @entity13 from that position of strength			2
this may in turn be related to the transition underway in the @entity10 leadership : either @entity19 himself demonstrating his toughness to his military , or groups within the military showing their loyalty to him by their forceful actions			1
the @entity13 has stated repeatedly that a nuclear @entity10 is unacceptable , especially because of the effect a nuclear @entity10 would have on other would - be nuclear powers , above all @entity79			2
but for now , a nuclear @entity10 is a reality we must deal with			2
@entity10 manufactured this crisis renewed dialogue between the @entity13 and @entity10 could reveal what combination of incentives might get the @entity10 to back down and eventually relinquish its nuclear capability -- and a nonnuclear @entity87 is the stated goal of all the parties in the six - way talks , including @entity10			1
@entity33 , which has its own interest in a stable @entity87 , must be brought into the negotiating process as well			0
the government of @entity94 in @entity3 has promised " stern retaliation " over the @entity4 attack , but knows its real options are limited			0
the @entity98 and @entity99 have strongly condemned the @entity10 action but have wisely urged restraint			1
@entity33 has also criticized @entity10 and called for a return to dialogue and a peaceful resolution of the current standoff			0
a space for common interest can be found among all sides with a stake in the @entity10 situation			0
what is required is the political courage , not least in @entity113 , to look beyond condemnation and to engage in the hard negotiations necessary to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .			0

@entity119 says @entity10 attack *confronts* the world with difficult options
sanctions have failed , military action could be *disastrous* ; talks the least bad choice , he says
@entity10 may be trying to show it *'s* a force to be reckoned with , @entity119 says
talks could reveal what it will take to get @entity62 to *abandon* nukes , he says
