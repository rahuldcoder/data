@entity0 -- one minute , he 's checking a cat 's mouth for gingivitis			2
the next , he 's carefully bandaging a dog 's bloody , broken nail			0
this could be any hard - working veterinarian tending to ailing animals			1
but the embroidered name on his crisp white medical coat bears a familiar name : dr. @entity16			1
he 's better known as former @entity17 sen. @entity16 , who abruptly announced his resignation 10 months ago amid a high - profile sex scandal			1
" i built this , " @entity16 told @entity1 in an exclusive interview inside @entity21 , where he now works			1
" it was the first 24 - hour animal hospital in @entity0 , and dr. @entity24 [ the current owner ] bought this from me , and now i 'm working for him , " he mused , calling it humbling , yet also " a very healthy thing to have happen in life			1
" @entity16 was the only veterinarian in @entity29			1
he had n't practiced since becoming a @entity31 senator more than a decade ago			2
@entity16 took @entity1 on an exclusive tour of the animal hospital , just a few blocks west of the @entity36 hotel and famous @entity0			1
stopping to look at a large dog getting a digital x-ray , he points to the image			0
" you can tell he 's had a crushed pelvis there , " he said			0
" you see our x-ray equipment ? it 's all digital now			0
" he said he works hard to get up to speed on the changes in technology and techniques since he was elected to the @entity53			0
" literally , i 'm studying , you know , till 10 , 11 o'clock every night and just trying to make sure that i get back up to a very high level in veterinary medicine , " @entity16 said			1
" there 's been a steep learning curve , and i 've gone to continuing - ed [ education ] conferences			0
i 've spent time with specialty practices , both in @entity63 and here , " he said			0
he insists veterinary medicine is where his heart is			0
" i loved being in the @entity53			0
that was a wonderful experience			0
but i 'm putting as much passion into this as i did that , and so i 'm really enjoying it			0
and the other nice thing is being home every night , you know , seeing my wife and kids every day , " @entity16 said			1
@entity16 is still with his wife , @entity76 , and says they 're doing " great " -- healing after his extramarital affair with @entity80 , a longtime friend and employee , led to his political downfall			1
last spring , the @entity83 issued a lengthy , stinging report with a torrid narrative of the affair , accusing @entity16 of violating the law by trying to help @entity89 's aggrieved husband -- a former staffer -- find lobbying jobs			1
@entity16 , an evangelical @entity91 , resigned three weeks before the report came out			1
when asked if he left @entity29 to avoid testifying before the @entity83 , he said , " my family had been through enough			1
i did n't want to put them through more			0
" @entity16 and his wife have three children , two boys and a girl -- one in college , one in high school and one in junior high			1
the committee report recommended that the @entity103 investigate @entity16 for violating the law , but he told us he has no indication that is happening			1
" i have n't heard anything since i left			2
i really do n't think about it until somebody like you asks me about it , " he said			0
but he did offer that he did n't think the ethics report was fair , saying it published the report without incorporating what @entity16 submitted			1
" they did not even consider our side in it , " @entity16 said			1
he is introspective about his fall from grace , warning those still in politics not to let power get the best of them , as it did him			1
" do everything that you possibly can to keep yourself grounded			0
and a big part of that is keep people surrounded , keep people around who basically will slap you upside the head and tell you when you 're doing wrong , " he advised			0
did n't he have that ? " i thought i did , but after a while , you develop invisible barriers and to where they 're actually intimidated to do that , even though i would say it all the time , " he said			0
" even when you really value people , you can still develop a little bit of an arrogance that you do n't even see in yourself			0
" @entity16 's political star was once so bright , the former member of the @entity147 leadership in the @entity53 had pondered a presidential run			2
does he have pangs now , watching @entity147 contenders like @entity152 and his old friend @entity153 go at it ? @entity16 shakes his head			2
" the chances for me would have been so slim anyway , but you know you ca n't go back , you ca n't look back			0
i 'm looking forward to veterinarian medicine , i 'm having a ball			2
" when he 's not at @entity21 , @entity16 spends his time at an animal shelter neutering dogs and cats -- and the shelter sometimes does hundreds in one day			2
he recently had to put a dog to sleep for the first time since returning to veterinarian medicine			2
" it was an older dog , and you know i held the lady , i hugged her			0
she wanted to be there when the animal was put to sleep			0
it was her husband 's dog , and he died four years ago , and so at the same time , you look at that as an incredible responsibility to be there for people , " @entity16 said			2
it 's those moments that make @entity16 call veterinarian medicine his life 's passion			1
and what about the politics ? the profession he was forced to leave ? @entity16 tries to keep a sense of humor about it all			1
" you know the bark is worse than the bite in @entity198 , " he said , tongue firmly in his cheek , adding , " i was vaccinated for rabies			2
" @entity1 senior congressional producer @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
