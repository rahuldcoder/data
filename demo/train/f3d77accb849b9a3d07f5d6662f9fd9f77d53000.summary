for the second year in a row @entity3 's leading women let fly a clarion call , setting the industry to rights			1
following @entity11 's remarks last year , in which the @entity8 winner excoriated the industry for its focus of male - centric filmmaking , @entity7 winner @entity7 rounded on @entity16 's attitude to gender inequality			1
@entity18 from a prepared speech @entity7 dedicated her award to " every woman who gave birth , to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation			2
we have fought for everybody else 's equal rights , it 's our time to have wage equality once and for all , and equal rights for women in the @entity16			1
" the actress ' comments received a rousing response ; three - time oscar winner @entity36 burst into enthusiastic applause alongside @entity38 , whilst @entity7 's ' boyhood ' co-star @entity39 and director @entity41 looked on with a mixture of pride and surprise			2
social media immediately rallied behind @entity7 's call			2
model @entity47 took to @entity49 while ' girls ' creator @entity50 and documentary maker @entity52 turned to @entity53			0
it was a night in which inequality was in tight focus			0
host @entity58 poked fun at the lack of diversity among the nominations , whilst rapper @entity63 and @entity65 star @entity64 brought tears to the eyes of audience members with their rendition of ' @entity71 's civil rights inspired song ' glory '			0
but with much of the pre-ceremony disquiet focused on the lack of racial diversity , few expected women 's inequality would be brought to the fore			2
wage inequality is still prevalent in @entity16			2
women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn , the nation ranking 65th globally in a report last autumn by the @entity85			0
last year the top ten earning actors made a combined $ 419 million , whilst the top ten earning actresses only managed $ 226 million			0
@entity7 's comments come after reports repeatedly confirm that women in @entity3 are being underpaid and underrepresented compared to their male counterparts			1
a 2014 study from the @entity95 found @entity3 's women commanded their highest wages at the average age of 34 , before rapidly declining			1
meanwhile men peak at the considerably older age of 51 , remaining stable thereafter			0
it speaks to @entity3 's obsession with women aging that much of the praise @entity7 received for ' boyhood ' revolved around her choice to age naturally on screen across the film 's long gestation period , from her peak of 33 through to 46			1
at age 65 , @entity36 has rebuffed the terminal decline @entity3 imposes on many actresses ' careers , but the pedestal the industry places her upon testifies to how rare a case she is			1
a recent report from the @entity120 in @entity121 and @entity122 has recorded a dearth of female - driven features , with actresses making up only 12 % of protagonists in 2014 's top - grossing films			1
this was despite such films earning a large share of total box office -- spearheaded by @entity132 , ' @entity133 : @entity134 ' was the top - grossing film in the @entity16 last year with $ 334 million			1
but such leading parts are few and far between			0
in fact , data suggests the number of female starring roles is decreasing , falling 3 % since 2013 and down 4 % on 2002			1
author of the study , dr @entity142 , told @entity143 that " there is a growing disconnect or gap between what we might perceive as being the current status of women in film and their actual status ... a few high - profile cases can skew our thinking			0
" lead actresses are even missing out in films directed by women			0
last year female protagonists starred in only 39 % of such films , whilst those directed by men registered at a meager 4 %			2
among the 57 films nominated at this year 's @entity163 , 15 had out - and - out female leads -- that being , a film told from the lead actress ' perspective			0
representing 26 % of the total nominees , this percentage is far higher than @entity3 's output last year			1
however , among those 15 films there were 11 foreign films , shorts , animations and documentaries , demonstrating how leading actresses are often left on the periphery when it comes to major @entity3 features			1
there were no female - driven stories among the eight films vying for @entity184 ; so too in both adapted and original screenplay categories			0
speaking of the lack of female - driven films , dr @entity142 pointed the finger of blame at those off - screen			0
" we need to have greater diversity behind the scenes if this is going to change			0

@entity7 took to the stage and *criticized* the lack of gender equality in @entity16
data shows women are both underrepresented and underpaid in @entity3
women took only 12 % of leading roles in @entity3 last year
women also underrepresented in minor roles , with age *demographics* still skewed towards the *young*
