-- nearly one in four people worldwide is @entity3 -- and they are not necessarily where you might think , according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global @entity3 population			2
nearly two out of three of the world 's @entity8 are in @entity10 , stretching from @entity11 to @entity12			1
@entity13 , a majority - @entity14 country , has more muslims than any country except for @entity12 and @entity17 , and more than twice as many as @entity18			2
@entity19 has more muslims than @entity21			2
@entity22 has more muslims than @entity24			2
and @entity25 has more muslims than @entity27 and @entity28 put together			2
nearly two out of three of the world 's @entity8 are in @entity10 , stretching from @entity11 to @entity12			1
the @entity31 and @entity32 , which together are home to about one in five of the world 's @entity8 , trail a very distant second			1
there are about 1.57 billion muslims in the world , according to the report , " mapping the @entity40 , " by the @entity41			1
that represents about 23 percent of the total global population of 6.8 billion			2
there are about 2.25 billion @entity45 , based on projections from the 2005 @entity47			2
@entity49 , the senior researcher on the @entity41 project , was slightly surprised at the number of @entity8 in the world , he told @entity0			1
" overall , the number is higher than i expected , " he said , noting that earlier estimates of the global muslim population have ranged from 1 billion to 1.8 billion			0
the report can -- and should -- have implications for @entity59 policy , said @entity60 , the best - selling @entity61 - @entity59 author of " no @entity62 but @entity63			0
" " increasingly , the people of the @entity31 are making up a smaller and smaller percentage of the worldwide @entity3 community , " he told @entity0 by phone			0
" when it comes to issues of outreach to the @entity3 world , these numbers will indicate that outreach can not be focused so narrowly on the @entity31 , " he said			0
" if the goal is to create better understanding between the @entity59 and the @entity3 world , our focus should be on south and southeast @entity10 , not the @entity31 , " he said			1
he spoke to @entity0 before the report was published and without having seen its contents , but was familiar with the general trends the report identified			0
the team at the @entity41 spent nearly three years analyzing " the best available data " from 232 countries and territories , @entity49 said			1
their aim was to get the most comprehensive snapshot ever assembled of the world 's @entity3 population at a given moment in time			1
so they took the data they gathered from national censuses and surveys , and projected it forward based on what they knew about population growth in each country			0
they describe the resulting report as " the largest project of its kind to date			0
" it 's full of details that even the researchers found surprising			0
" there are these countries that we do n't think of as @entity3 at all , and yet they have very sizable numbers of @entity8 , " said @entity111 , the associate director of research for the @entity41 , naming @entity13 , @entity25 and @entity19			1
one in five of the world 's @entity8 lives in a country where @entity8 are a minority			1
and while most people think of the @entity3 population of @entity123 is being composed of immigrants , that 's only true in western @entity123 , @entity111 said			0
" in the rest of @entity123 -- @entity25 , @entity127 , @entity128 , those places -- @entity8 are an indigenous population , " he said			1
" more than half of the @entity8 in @entity123 are indigenous			1
" the researchers also were surprised to find the @entity3 population of @entity135 to be as low as they concluded , @entity111 said			0
it has only about 240 million @entity8 -- about 15 percent of all the world 's @entity8			1
@entity138 is thought to be growing fast in the region , with countries such as @entity141 , which has large populations of both @entity45 and @entity8 , seeing violence between the two groups			2
the @entity41 researchers concluded that @entity141 is just over half @entity3 , making it the sixth most populous @entity3 country in the world			1
roughly nine out of 10 @entity8 worldwide are @entity148 , and about one in 10 is @entity8 , they estimated			1
they warned they were less confident of those numbers than of the general population figures because sectarian data is harder to come by			0
" only one or two censuses in the world ... have ever asked the sectarian question , " said @entity49			0
" among @entity8 it 's a very sensitive question			1
if asked , large numbers will say i am just a muslim -- not that they do n't know , but it is a sensitive question in many places , " he said			0
one in three of the world 's @entity8 lives in @entity61 , which is one of only four countries with a @entity8 majority , he said			1
the others are @entity168 , @entity169 , and @entity170			0
huge as the project of mapping the world 's @entity3 population is , it is only the first step in a @entity41 undertaking			1
next year , the think tank intends to release a report projecting @entity3 population growth into the future , and then the researchers intend to do the whole thing over again with @entity45 , followed by other faith groups			0
" we do n't care only about @entity8 , " @entity49 said			2
they 're also digging into what people believe and practice , since the current analysis does n't analyze that			0
" this is no way reflects the religiosity of people , only their self - identification , " @entity49 said			0
" we 're trying to get the overall picture of religion in the world			0

there are about 1.57 billion muslims in the world , according to the report
