-- @entity1 is one of @entity3 's most recognizable and prolific movie stars			1
in a career spanning four decades , he 's starred in more than 50 feature films , including blockbusters such as " @entity7 " and " @entity8			1
" in the early ' 80s , back - to - back performances in " @entity10 " and " @entity11 " raised temperatures worldwide and cemented @entity1 's status as a heartthrob and sex symbol			1
but for all his accolades , one thing missing from the star 's resume is an @entity20			2
many critics were certain a nomination would come for his memorable turn as @entity25 in the 2002 @entity27 winner , " @entity28			1
" the movie musical earned a whopping 13 nominations , including acting nods for @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			0
it sent @entity36 home with a statue -- but nothing for @entity1			1
@entity3 has once again shifted into awards gear , and for the first time in a decade , the iconic leading man could get another swing at @entity27			1
this year , @entity1 flexed his dramatic muscles in @entity45 's " arbitrage , " playing a brilliant but troubled @entity47 tycoon			1
his performance has received widespread praise from critics as well as a @entity52 nomination			1
with the film now available for home viewing and @entity27 voters turning in their ballots , @entity1 opens up about what a nomination would mean to him ; why things such as power , money and beauty do n't really matter ; and the best decision he 's ever made about his hair			1
@entity0 : in " arbitrage , " you play a hedge fund fat cat with a lot of personal and professional secrets			2
since the economy took a nosedive , these guys are usually the villains , but somehow you make him sympathetic			0
@entity1 : i would n't say he 's sympathetic ; i was trying to make him human			1
he does a lot of bad things , and i did n't want to sugarcoat that , but i do n't know how you could sustain this story , if the guy was a capital " v " villain			2
the world has gray areas for all of us			0
most of us do n't have the opportunity to compromise to the degree that this guy does with that much power and money , but the impulse is the same -- it 's just a question of degree			1
that 's what i wanted to do with this			2
i wanted to be a mirror for ourselves			0
@entity0 : in the first scene , you 're celebrating your 60th birthday , and i thought , " there 's no way @entity1 is 60 ! " but you 're 63			1
... @entity1 : i 'm actually 83			1
( @entity107 ) i 'm very well - preserved			0
i had six hours of makeup before i came in here			0
@entity0 : that would be a headline			0
but seriously , aging in @entity3 is famously difficult , and you 've managed to do it seamlessly			0
@entity1 : we were laughing about it before			1
someone told me recently , " oh , you never colored your hair			2
" i know a lot of actors and directors who seem to get darker hair every year , and mine gets more paper white all the time			0
but i 'm very glad i made that decision , and it seemed to work out			0
@entity0 : was there a time in your life when you knew you had a certain impact on the opposite sex ? @entity1 : not at all			1
the only difference in my life over anyone else is that i 've gone through this kind of scrutiny for a long time			0
but we all have hopes , fears , angers , jealousies -- we 're all the same			0
it 's like my character in the film ; look at the package of this guy -- that car , those suits , the haircut , the mistress , the way he moves			2
in the end it 's all meaningless			2
there are some core issues that we all go through			0
it does n't matter how poor or rich or whatever , if you 've done that kind of internal work that can open up genuine doors to selflessness -- which is the root of some kind of happiness that is real and that you can hold on to			2
@entity0 : some might say it 's a bit easier to have that opinion when the surface looks so nice			2
@entity1 : yeah , but nobody looks in the mirror and goes , " oooh , nice ! " @entity0 : really ? i might argue that point			1
look , i 've been married to two of the world 's most beautiful women , and i never remember them looking in the mirror and going , " oooh , you look good			2
" it 's all relative			2
@entity0 : there 's a theory that the grumpy old men in the academy are jealous of matinee idols , like you , @entity187 and @entity188 , and that 's why you do n't win @entity20			1
it 's only when you cross over behind the camera like @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 that they take you seriously			0
have you heard of that ? @entity1 : ( @entity107 ) no. @entity0 : what would it mean to you to be nominated for your performance in " arbitrage " ? @entity1 : it would feel great , of course			1
everyone wants to feel appreciated			0
i like the movie , and i think @entity204 , who wrote and directed it , did a really great job			0
i 'm happy with my performance in it			0
i do n't think any actor is ever totally delighted with what they do , but you get easier on it later			1
@entity0 : you 've accomplished so much , but do you still dream and set goals for yourself ? @entity1 : i 've never wanted for something and then was able to make it happen			1
life does n't really work like that			0
i think the process of getting older is just to let it happen			0
while you 're focused on trying to make something happen , you 're missing out on so many other things around you			0
so i think in my own case the process of maturing is to just be more open -- to feel the whole thing .			0
