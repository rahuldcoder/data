@entity0 -- a day after state lawmakers were due to head home , a pair of controversial issues seem to stubbornly postpone their summer recess			2
the first is something that many call a quintessential @entity0 battle : whether to enact the first statewide cap on property taxes			0
the cap is linked to the extension of rent control laws that apply to roughly 1 million apartments , most of them in @entity16			0
the second is the subject of national debate : should @entity0 become the sixth state in the union to adopt same - sex marriage laws ? monday was technically the last official day of the legislative session , but the votes are still pending			1
on tuesday , senate majority leader @entity25 said lawmakers had reached a " framework for an agreement " on the rent and tax issues , but acknowledged that same - same sex marriage was not a part of those deliberations			1
the @entity34 has struggled to bring to the floor a bill that would legalize the unions , but separate talks continued tuesday , according to a spokesman for @entity25			2
a vote on the measure , which the state @entity43 passed wednesday night , has been stalled in part by @entity46 concerns over protections for religious institutions against the potential for litigation in the wake of the proposed law			1
republicans , led by @entity25 , have expressed concerns over the " unintended consequences " of a bill that redefines the legal parameters of marriage			1
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators filled the state @entity60 in @entity62 in anticipation of the vote , chanting slogans and wielding signs for and against the controversial measure			0
at last public count , 31 senators , including two republicans , were in favor of the bill			0
its backers need one more @entity46 member to vote in favor for it to pass			1
gov. @entity78 , who proposed the bill , says it would grant same - sex couples equal rights to marry " as well as hundreds of rights , benefits and protections that are currently limited to married couples of the opposite sex			1
" the first - term governor has lobbied opposition and undecided senators in an effort to secure the lone vote needed for the bill 's passage			0
meanwhile , @entity95 -- one of several @entity46 senators who are considered on the fence over the pending vote -- reiterated his party 's concerns about the legislation 's potential impact on religious institutions			2
" i 'm not going to vote for a bill where @entity109 adoption agencies or religious organizations are shut down or are opened up to lawsuits , " he said friday , noting that adoption agencies were closed after same - sex marriage laws were adopted in other states			1
democrat @entity112 , an openly gay member of the @entity34 , countered friday that there are " already laws on the books in @entity0 which protect people of faith			0
" " marriage is a civil right			0
people get married , and it is recognized in government , " he said			0
" we 're talking about the government recognizing same - sex equality			2
" but the passage of same - sex marriage laws faces a daunting history in the @entity129			1
the @entity34 rejected a bill to legalize same - sex marriage in 2009 and has blocked the last three attempts by the state 's lower house to get the proposed legislation signed into law			1
although @entity0 currently does not grant same - sex marriages , a 2008 appellate court ruling upheld the right of couples to have their same - sex marriages recognized if they are performed elsewhere			2
the current measure would amend the state 's @entity143 to say , among other changes , that " no application for a marriage license shall be denied on the ground that the parties are of the same or a different sex			0
" five states -- @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 -- and the @entity157 currently grant same - sex marriage licenses			1
@entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0

@entity34 leader says lawmakers reach " framework for *...* agreement " on rent , tax issues
@entity46 have concerns over " unintended consequences " of same - sex marriage bill
backers need one more @entity46 @entity34 vote for same - sex bill to pass
