@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 mounted a counter-attack sunday against ratifying a new nuclear arms treaty with @entity6 this year , trying to put off a vote that @entity8 say they will win if it is held			1
senate minority leader @entity9 of @entity10 led the way , telling @entity1 's " @entity16 " that members of his party need more time to consider the @entity15 accord			2
" i 've decided i can not support the treaty , " @entity17 said in his first outright rejection of ratifying the treaty during the current lame - duck session of @entity21			1
the treaty would resume mutual inspections of @entity26 and @entity6 nuclear arsenals , while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each			1
on sunday , @entity8 rejected a @entity2 amendment to the treaty 's preamble that would have added a reference to tactical nuclear weapons , which are not covered by the pact			1
@entity2 senators are " uneasy " about the treaty , and trying to get a vote before @entity38 was not the best way to " get the support of people like me , " @entity17 said			1
his unequivocal stance increased the @entity2 's public opposition to ratification , which would require at least 10 @entity2 senators to vote with the @entity8 to reach the two - thirds majority of 67 needed			1
the @entity51 caucus has 58 members , but one of them , sen. @entity53 of @entity54 , is preparing for prostate cancer surgery monday and is expected to miss the rest of the current lame - duck session that expires january 4			0
if the vote gets put off to the new @entity21 , as @entity2 want , the number of @entity2 votes needed for ratification rises to at least 14 because the @entity8 will have a diminished majority of 53 seats			1
@entity17 's comments prompted a response from his @entity51 counterpart , senate majority leader @entity67 of @entity69 , who issued a statement saying he was " deeply disappointed " at @entity17 's opposition to the treaty			1
@entity67 's statement noted that " respected @entity2 leaders " including former president @entity76 and several former secretaries of state , as well as the current military leadership all called for ratification			2
in addition , @entity67 's statement said , the proposed treaty has been available since may and the @entity83 administration has answered questions from senators and taken steps to address concerns			0
for example , the administration has committed to increased spending on modernizing the @entity26 nuclear arsenal at the request of sen. @entity92 , @entity93 , who had been leading the @entity2 opposition to the treaty			1
" i know many senators , including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , who share the belief that this treaty is too critical to our national security to delay , and i look forward to strong bipartisan support to pass this treaty before we end this session of @entity21 , " @entity67 's statement concluded			1
later sunday , @entity67 filed a cloture motion -- a necessary procedural step to end debate and set up a vote			2
" after months of consideration and five days of open and robust debate , it is time to move forward on a treaty that will help reverse nuclear proliferation and make it harder for terrorists to get their hands on a nuclear weapon			1
every day we delay is another day we do not have inspectors on the ground in @entity6 monitoring their nuclear arsenal , " he said in a statement			0
@entity51 sen. @entity125 , the chairman of the @entity126 , predicted sunday that @entity8 have the necessary support for ratification and that the vote would occur in the coming days			1
" i believe it will pass , and i believe there will be a vote , " @entity125 said on the @entity131 program " @entity132			0
" however , the ranking @entity2 on the @entity3 panel , @entity137 of @entity138 , said he was uncertain that the vote would occur before the lame - duck session expires			1
" several republicans will support it , and i join the chairman ( @entity125 ) in believing that there are the votes there , " said @entity137 , who backs ratification			0
" the problem is really getting to that final vote			0
" @entity137 noted that the @entity3 still needs to debate @entity2 amendments to the treaty			1
any change in the language or substance of the pact would require reopening negotiations with @entity6 , effectively killing the agreement			0
so far , @entity8 have defeated the two @entity2 amendments proposed -- sunday 's attempt to add a reference to tactical nuclear weapons , and a saturday bid by sen. @entity163 of @entity93 to remove from the preamble language recognizing a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons			1
in both cases , however , @entity8 were at least seven votes shy of the 67 they will need to ratify the treaty			2
@entity2 sen. @entity171 , @entity173 - @entity172 , on sunday continued questioning the language cited in the failed @entity163 amendment , telling the @entity177 program " @entity178 " that it could undermine future development of @entity26 missile defense systems			2
according to @entity171 , @entity6 could object to continuing @entity26 development of missile defense capability as a violation of the treaty and withdraw from it			0
@entity92 , appearing on " @entity186 , " also challenged the language in the preamble , which he said changes the past @entity26 stance by linking offensive and defensive weapons			0
" in the last arms control treaty with @entity6 in 2002 we absolutely separated the two issues , " @entity92 said			0
now , he said , the @entity8 were insisting the treaty ca n't be changed			2
if that 's the case , @entity92 said , " we 're just a rubber stamp for the administration and the @entity6 , the administration that for the first time was n't willing to stand up to the @entity6 and say , ' you 're not going to implicate our missile defenses			0
' " however , @entity51 sen. @entity202 of @entity203 , the chairman of the @entity204 , labeled the missile defense concern a " straw man " argument without substance			0
the nation 's top military leaders say " there is no restriction , no limitations whatsoever " on missile defense in the treaty , @entity202 said			0
@entity137 also challenged some of the @entity2 arguments , saying the resumed inspections under the new treaty were essential for verifying compliance by @entity6			1
in addition , the treaty represents new opportunities to engage with @entity6 on important issues in the continuing evolution of relations between the countries after the @entity229 era , he noted			0
" to throw away all of those opportunities simply because some feel the @entity6 are no longer relevant or we should just simply build whatever we want to quite apart from the @entity6 seems to me is an illogical stance , but we 're hearing a lot of that , " @entity137 said on the @entity131 program			0
@entity8 argued that the @entity3 has plenty of time to consider further @entity2 amendments and debate the treaty before the new @entity21 gets sworn in during the first week of january			1
previous arms control treaties have taken a similar amount of time to debate , @entity202 noted on the @entity177 program			0
the @entity3 is expected to go into a closed session monday afternoon to discuss classified information related to the treaty			2
on saturday , president @entity83 sent letters to @entity17 and @entity67 expressing his support for the accord			2
" the new start treaty places no limitations on the development or deployment of our missile defense programs , " @entity83 wrote			0
@entity1 's @entity256 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 defeat a second @entity2 amendment
the @entity3 @entity2 leader says he opposes the treaty if the vote occurs now
wait until a new @entity21 *convenes* in january to debate it , @entity17 says
the treaty resumes inspections and limits nuclear arsenals of both nations
