-- @entity3 and @entity4 plan to take in about 200 @entity6 refugees from @entity7 who have been living in refugee camps along the @entity7 - @entity10 border , the @entity2 refugee agency said tuesday			1
more than two dozen refugees stranded at the @entity14 refugee camp for the last two years will be headed to @entity3 in the next few weeks , the agency said			2
in addition , 155 @entity6 in the @entity17 refugee camp have been accepted for resettlement in @entity4 , it said			1
many @entity6 living in @entity7 have gotten caught up in the violence that has engulfed the country since the @entity23 - led invasion in 2003 and have had to flee their homes			1
the @entity2 high commissioner for refugees said that out of the estimated 34,000 @entity6 who lived in @entity7 since 2003 , about 10,000 to 15,000 remain			1
the @entity26 says about 2,300 @entity6 " are living in desperate conditions along the @entity7 - @entity10 border			1
" they are , the @entity26 says , " unable to return to @entity7 or to cross the borders to neighboring countries			0
" it says the @entity14 camp has 1,400 people and @entity17 about 900			0
" @entity26 has repeatedly called for international support for the @entity6 but with few results			0
few @entity6 in the border camps have been accepted for resettlement or offered shelter in third countries ; 223 @entity6 left to non-traditional resettlement countries such as @entity41 and @entity42			0
" some urgent medical cases were taken by a few @entity46 countries , but this is a very small number out of the 2,300 palestinians stranded in the desert , " the @entity26 said in a statement			0
it noted that @entity50 has made an offer to take in some of those @entity6 , and said " @entity26 and @entity6 representatives are finalizing an operations plan that will enable this to take place			1
" @entity56 recently asked the @entity23 government to intervene and resettle the @entity6 in the @entity23 instead of @entity50 , which itself is engulfed in sectarian fighting and whose government has been condemned for atrocities			2
" the @entity6 being resettled in @entity50 is obviously not an ideal or preferred solution , " @entity62 spokesman @entity61 told @entity0 last month			2
" but we accept the judgment of the @entity26 that it is preferable to the @entity6 continuing to be stranded in the border area in extremely dire circumstances			0

some 200 @entity6 refugees from @entity7 will go to @entity3 , @entity4
2,300 @entity6 " are living in desperate conditions along the @entity7 - @entity10 border "
