-- bashing @entity1 for his remarks regarding race is like @entity4 dunking on a 5 - foot rim : pointless			1
and the same is true for @entity7 owner @entity6 , if you believe that he made the remarks attributed to him by @entity10 and @entity11			2
as president @entity15 said , " when ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance , you do n't really have to do anything , you just let them talk			0
" still talking about the talk of the ignorant is fun			0
after all , few things are more entertaining than well - executed memes and a hashtag in front of stupidity			2
the problem is that while men such as @entity1 and @entity6 may be racist , they are not the face of racism			1
but we 'll place that yoke on their shoulders anyway because it 's easy , like @entity4 dunking on a kiddie rim			2
some conservatives will quickly pedal away from the @entity36 and the @entity37 of the world , insisting that they are not like those rodeo clowns			0
they do n't have a racist bone in their body because they would never make such outlandish statements			2
but then they turn around and marvel at how " well - spoken " or " articulate " a black person is and think nothing of it			0
politicians of all stripes will publicly denounce the offensive things that @entity1 says but continue to construct policies that cater to his sensibilities			1
today , racism is n't a crazy old white man with a dead calf on his shoulders proclaiming he 's " unracist			1
" no , it 's elected officials such as @entity60 rep. @entity59 of @entity61 saying inner - city men are " not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work " and then feigning shock that people saw a racist element to his statements			1
@entity1 and @entity6 are just the lightning rods of the moment			2
not too long ago , @entity73 was the social pariah			0
meanwhile , @entity75 is busily working in the shadows , gerrymandering away voting rights and creating legislation that makes pre-emptively shooting dead a young black man who makes you nervous synonymous with standing one 's ground			1
the longer the media allow ignorant relics like @entity1 to continue to hog the spotlight -- and the public points at him as the face of conservative racism -- the longer the current incarnation can go unchecked			1
that does n't mean @entity1 's fight with the government should be ignored			1
that does n't mean @entity6 's alleged remarks -- and well - documented past of discrimination -- should be overlooked			1
only that their views -- and thus , importance -- should be kept in perspective			0
for mispronouncing @entity102 ' name pales in comparison to the politics of courting a racist electorate			0
it pales in comparison to the lack of compassion for the five children who were shot @entity111 at a park on the south side of @entity114 or the characterization of poor people as takers			0
during the height of the recession , according to an analysis in @entity120 , 33 states increased spending on prisons while decreasing spending on education , and we 're to believe the disproportionate number of minorities in jail is a coincidence ? so , yeah , yuk it up at @entity1 's expense			1
keep tweeting # @entity133 if it makes you feel better ( though i 'd be more prone to use my 140 characters to ask why the @entity137 thought @entity6 was a good candidate for a lifetime achievement award )			0
but do n't make such people out to be anything more than what they are -- the few remaining voices of oppression from years past			0
today racism has a different look			2
a different voice -- though the song is still the same .			0

@entity151 : bashing @entity1 's remarks is easy , but he 's not face of today 's racism
he says politicians denounce remarks even as they push or abide de facto racist policies
he says gerrymandering , stand - your - ground laws , voter id laws all are @entity164 *2.0*
@entity151 : look for real racism in spending on jails , not *schools*
