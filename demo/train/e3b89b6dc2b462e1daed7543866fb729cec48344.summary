-- from the " @entity8 " trilogy to the tearjerkers adapted from @entity4 novels to nearly every film where @entity6 takes off his shirt , let 's face it : most cinematic love stories are made for women			2
so it may seem strange to release the new " @entity16 " installment , " @entity17 , " on @entity15			0
but for our money , it makes perfect sense			0
where " @entity24 " is the gold standard for women , the original " @entity16 " is the ultimate romantic movie for men			2
sound crazy ? stick with me			0
the 1988 original stars @entity29 as @entity30 , a sarcastic @entity31 cop visiting his estranged wife @entity32 ( @entity33 ) and his two children in @entity35			1
when he arrives at @entity32 's office @entity40 party , the tension in their relationship is immediately evident			2
@entity32 is using her maiden name again and @entity30 does n't even plan to stay with his family while he 's in town			1
there 's no doubt that @entity30 loves his wife and wants to rekindle the romance , but he ca n't seem to admit it			1
but while @entity30 proves incapable of communicating his feelings to his wife verbally , an opportunity arises allowing him to prove his devotion to her			1
review : @entity29 goes through the motions in ' @entity17 ' @entity60 through the party , a team of terrorists led by the stylish @entity56 ( a scene - stealing @entity57 ) interrupts the event and holds most of the attendees hostage			1
the quick - thinking @entity30 eludes their grasp and eventually begins taking down the bad guys one by one in order to rescue his captured wife			1
the story 's subtext recognizes the stereotypical , but undeniable fact that many men are n't romantic or open with their emotions			2
despite what many rom - coms and dramas suggest , a lot of guys do n't picture themselves courting a woman by blasting a boombox outside a bedroom window , as is done in " @entity81			0
" ( in fact , that 's probably illegal in most states			0
) and forget " @entity85			0
" guys do n't want to get the girl of their dreams by freezing in the ocean while keeping the one they love afloat on a piece of driftwood			0
( that plan does n't actually work long - term , either			0
) men often imagine winning a girl 's affection by proving their worth in a battle against someone or something that threatens their loved one 's life			0
while many women want the men in their lives to be sensitive like @entity110 's " notebook " character @entity109 , guys aspire to be like the renegade @entity30 in " @entity16			1
" @entity30 offers a brand of masculinity and strength that men can look up to ( akin to what @entity117 and @entity118 once offered moviegoers )			1
@entity30 does n't back down and he never gives up			1
the cold and calculating @entity56 may mock @entity30 for his cowboy mentality , his freewheeling spirit and his assumed affection for masculine film actors of the past ( like @entity117 )			2
but @entity30 does n't care what @entity56 thinks			2
@entity30 just keeps killing bad guys			1
while separated from his wife , @entity30 shows his love for her by killing terrorists and trying to protect her			1
compare that to @entity110 's @entity109 : when he 's separated from the girl he loves , he writes love letters			2
how does @entity30 send messages in " @entity16 " ? he writes notes on the sweatshirts of dead terrorists , and in one scene even throws a dead terrorist out a window to send a message to a passing police officer			1
that 's how he communicates			0
the climactic scenes at the end of " @entity16 " prove why it 's a perfect @entity15 flick for guys			0
there is no declaration of love between @entity30 and his wife			1
there is no grand romantic gesture that shows how much he cares for her			0
as the story concludes , @entity30 â € ” who has been shot , brutalized and cut by hundreds of pieces of glass â € ” has proven his love for his wife by killing all the terrorists who threatened her			1
and with that , he gets the girl and they make out in the back seat of a limo			0
now that 's love .			0

writer *argues* that " @entity172 " is kind of romantic
@entity29 ' character loves his wife and wants to rekindle their relationship
@entity30 proves his love for his wife by killing terrorists
