-- a @entity3 clan leader 's bizarre attempt to revive the territorial claims of a defunct @entity6 sultanate on the island of @entity8 appears to be falling apart			0
with his followers engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with @entity14 security forces in the villages and palm oil plantations of northeastern @entity8 , the self - proclaimed @entity17 is calling for a cease - fire after the @entity20 secretary - general urged an end to the violence			1
but @entity14 promptly rejected the proposal and said its security forces had killed more than 30 of the @entity3 fighters on thursday			1
between 100 and 300 men from the southern @entity3 came ashore in the area , in the @entity14 state of @entity29 , about three weeks ago , claiming to be the @entity30 of the sultanate of @entity17 , a former kingdom in the region whose power has faded			1
@entity35 , one of the clan leaders claiming to be the rightful sultan , says he sent the men , some of whom are armed , to @entity29 to reassert the sultanate 's sovereignty over the area			2
but their arrival in the coastal district of @entity47 caused alarm and embarrassment in @entity14 , which still pays a token fee each year to the sultanate for the lease of @entity29			2
while scrambling to explain how so many armed intruders had managed to slip through the maritime border that separates @entity29 from the nearby southern @entity3 islands , @entity14 security forces tried to persuade the clansmen to return home peacefully			1
but those efforts -- supported by the @entity3 government , which is pursuing a peace initiative with @entity63 rebels in its restive southern islands -- failed as clashes in @entity29 late last week left about 28 people dead , including several @entity14 police officers			1
a @entity14 offensive @entity14 authorities responded by launching an offensive using fighter jets , mortar shells and ground troops on tuesday			0
they followed that up with what they called a " mopping up " operation , going house to house in the area , searching for the @entity84 fighters			0
but @entity35 's spokesman , @entity85 , said wednesday that the @entity14 attack had missed its target , striking an area that the @entity84 clansmen had already vacated			1
he claimed the group had n't suffered casualties			0
a day later , @entity85 made the call for a cease - fire on behalf of @entity35 , saying the clan was responding to @entity20 @entity96 ban ki - moon 's plea for the fighting to stop			1
but @entity14 prime minister @entity99 said @entity100 wo n't consider any request for a cease - fire as long as the armed intruders in @entity29 refuse to lay down weapons unconditionally , the official news agency @entity98 reported thursday			1
later on , @entity105 , the head of the @entity14 @entity106 , said security forces had killed 32 " militants " in @entity29 on thursday , including one they believed had the rank of general , according to @entity98			1
the task of the @entity14 security forces in hunting down the clan members has been made more complicated by the strong ethnic ties between many of the people in @entity29 and the southern @entity3			1
many of the sultanate 's followers are believed to have friends and family living in the area			0
@entity14 police have admitted that the @entity3 are blending in with the local population			2
in a statement wednesday , @entity96 's office said the @entity20 secretary - general " urges an end to the violence and encourages dialogue among all the parties for a peaceful resolution of the situation			0
" @entity96 also expressed concern about the effects of the fighting on the civilian population in the area , including migrants			0
people and goods regularly go back and forth across the porous sea border between @entity29 and the southern @entity3			2
eroded power established in the 15th century , the @entity17 of @entity17 became an @entity6 power center in the southern @entity3 that at one point claimed sovereignty over @entity29			2
but the encroachment of @entity148 colonial powers , followed by the emergence of the @entity3 and @entity14 as independent nation states , steadily eroded the sultanate 's influence			0
@entity17 is now a province within the @entity3			0
but the historical connection still fuels tensions between @entity14 and the @entity3 , with @entity156 retaining a " dormant claim " to @entity29 through the @entity17 , according to the @entity157			1
the @entity3 claims much of the eastern part of @entity29 , which was leased to the @entity160 in 1878 by the sultanate of @entity17			0
in 1963 , @entity162 transferred @entity29 to @entity14 , a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal			0
@entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0

new : more than 30 " militants " are killed in @entity29 , @entity14 says
@entity14 says it wo n't consider a cease - fire unless armed intruders drop weapons
@entity14 forces launched an attack this week on @entity3 clansmen in the area
between 100 and 300 @entity3 arrived by boat on the @entity14 coast in *february*
