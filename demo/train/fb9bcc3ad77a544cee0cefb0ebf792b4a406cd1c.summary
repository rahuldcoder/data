-- hugely successful and often controversial , @entity1 is a man full of complexities			1
he points the finger in his new book " @entity5 " but calls for " @entity6 " in his upcoming rally			0
he jokes about being " unelectable " on his comedy tour , but his new studio in @entity10 includes a replica @entity12 for his mock presidential addresses			0
now , the media mogul is dropping his name from the online tv network based on his personal brand			1
@entity18 will be merged with @entity19 , the @entity1 - owned but independently operated news and opinion website			1
the entire network will be called @entity23			0
" i did n't like the name @entity18 from the very beginning for a couple of reasons , " @entity1 said in an exclusive interview with @entity0			1
" one , it 's a little egocentric , and two , it 's television , which does n't describe necessarily what we do			1
" @entity1 and @entity31 , president and coo of @entity23 ( @entity1 's company ) , said they planned to change the name once the online streaming network was more established but the early success of @entity18 precipitated an earlier name change			1
the latest estimate is that @entity18 has more than 300,000 subscribers			0
while the numbers are strong , that is still a significant reduction from @entity1 's nightly audience when he worked at @entity43 and talked to millions on the traditional media outlet			1
" we are out of the comfort zone for a lot of @entity47 , " said @entity1 of @entity18			2
the online network that airs @entity1 's program also has shows such as " @entity51 , " a news roundtable show ; " the @entity53 , " a comedy show ; " @entity55 , " a children 's program ; and " @entity57 , " a reality show			1
much more programming is on the way , and it will soon become a 24/7 channel			0
@entity19 launched in august 2010 and now claims more than 7 million unique visitors a month			2
already before the merger , the @entity1 empire was increasingly falling under the " @entity66 " moniker , including a print magazine			2
" from a management perspective , what we 're doing is bringing together what are the all - stars from both groups into one team , " said @entity31			0
that all - star team includes some unlikely executives who have joined the @entity1 team			2
there 's @entity78 , formerly ceo of @entity79 and before that an executive at @entity81			0
there 's @entity83 , formerly a senior vice president at @entity0 and @entity43			1
also @entity84 , formerly founder of @entity86 , and @entity87 , who was a consultant at @entity88			0
another notable part of @entity19 is its clear non-beckness			2
" if you just look at the comments section , there are people who read the @entity66 all the time but hate my guts , " said @entity1			1
but it 's more than that -- one of the most memorable and talked about series of articles on @entity19 was a meticulous debunking of the @entity105 @entity104 videos , which claimed to show an @entity104 executive denigrating the @entity107 , that ran on an @entity109 - associated website			1
the series garnered strong praise from places such as long - time beck nemesis media matters			0
" hopefully some of them will discover @entity23 , will discover @entity1 's show , and decide that they want to watch , " said @entity31			1
" others will discover other things on @entity23 which they might like more			0
" if people were surprised by the takedown of the @entity105 video , @entity1 says it 's because they do n't remember who he was before his @entity43 days			1
" i think that 's people forgetting who i was and what i was saying when i was on @entity0 before @entity128 , " said @entity1 , who was a @entity124 host from 2006 to 2008			1
" i was one of the hardest - hitting conservatives on @entity130			0
republicans did n't like me on @entity130			0
republicans still do n't like me on many things			0
if any @entity134 thinks i 've been hard on @entity135 or @entity136 or any of these guys , wait until @entity135 gets into office			2
i 'll hold his feet to the fire just as much			1
" @entity1 : as we shrink government , grow giving of course , it may be the @entity43 days that people remember , when he 'd assign labels such as fascist , communist and radical to those , mostly on the left , with whom he disagreed , often with the tone of impending doom ( and chalkboards )			1
@entity1 agrees that the polarization and ratcheted - up rhetoric is bad for the country , but was he part of the problem in the first place ? " nobody ever , ever gives me credit for the times i 've said on the air ' the president is right on this , did this right ' or ' the media is unfair by trying to say this about the president , ' or ' the right is unfair			1
' i bet i do that at least once a month			0
" but what about calling @entity128 a " coward " in his new book ? " sometimes the truth hurts , " said @entity1			2
" and if you 'd read the book ' cowards , ' you 'd see president @entity128 is not the only one , and it 's certainly not a @entity134 and @entity181 book			0
it is a human problem			1
cowardice is a human problem			1
" while @entity1 is n't outwardly supporting either of the two major candidates in the 2012 election , he does have a prediction			1
" if things would remain stable , i would say we are looking at a loss for the president around the size of , if not greater than , @entity194 , " he said			0
they are tired of the finger - pointing			0
they are tired of the excuses			0
they 're tired of it on both sides			0
" @entity1 is someone who constantly talks about truth			2
@entity19 's tagline is " the truth has no agenda " while @entity18 currently uses " the truth lives here			1
" explaining his ideology , @entity1 described it as " people should be free , people should be unencumbered by regulation as much as possible , that big government always goes corrupt and the truth shall always set you free			1
" it 's this philosophy that seeps into his plans for the independence of the new , merged @entity23 : " we have to tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may			0
" trust comes into play in another area of the @entity1 empire , arguably where he has his most power and is at his most contentious : radio			2
last week it was announced that @entity1 signed a new five - year deal with @entity86 , reportedly estimated at $ 100 million			2
is he worth it ? and what is it about the show that makes it worth one the biggest contracts on radio ever ? " the strength of the show is the listeners , and the bond i have with the listeners , " said @entity1			2
" they are some of the smartest , unforgiving people			0
they mean what they say and say what they mean			0
... the biggest thing we have going for us is we 've always tried to shoot straight with the audience , we 've always tried to hold ourselves to our own standards , and part of those standards is we do n't waste anyone 's time			1
" with @entity18 gone and @entity23 taking over , @entity1 is n't done			1
the change is one part of a new plan , which he 's dropped some hints about recently , to focus on inserting conservatism into the mainstream cultural landscape			0
" a country is made not by policy alone , but by its music , its entertainment shows , all of it , " said @entity1			2
that plan may get mainstream acceptance like @entity18 has			0
recently , talent agent @entity265 , certainly not a fan of @entity1 's politics , praised the network as a " model " for the media			1
it could also face mainstream derision as some of @entity1 's radio proclamations do , but it likely will get an audience talking			1
" change is not bad , " said @entity1			2
" we are on the threshold of something i think is as powerful as the @entity280 was , except this one will happen in a very short period of time			0
... whether we 're the ones to [ revolutionize media ] or we 're just the ones who happen to be the first on the scene , i do n't know			0
but we 're moving forward because the media revolution has begun			0
" it 's another complexity in the @entity1 world			1
while the message is about " restoring " conservative values of the past , the delivery model is revolution , and the future .			0

" cowardice is a human problem , " he says
@entity1 on @entity135 if he wins : " i 'll hold his feet to the fire "
