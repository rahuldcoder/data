under the watchful gaze of one monarch , a new king was crowned at @entity3 saturday as the @entity5 - trained @entity4 dominated rivals to claim @entity8 's most prestigious race , the @entity9			1
but it was a day of disappointment for the pre-race favorite , @entity14 - owned @entity13 , who failed in his quest to add the @entity9 to his 2,000 @entity17 last month			1
@entity18 , a regular @entity9 attendee , was among those who had gathered to see @entity13 attempt to become the 38th horse to win the first two legs of @entity8 racing 's @entity23			1
but his race was over within the first furlong as the @entity29 - trained colt appeared to crack under the pressure of a tactical early pace , pulling fiercely from the start and refusing to settle for jockey @entity33			2
after briefly hitting the front at the mile marker , the son of 2008 @entity9 winner @entity38 faded badly and eventually finished second from last			1
his connections conceded it would probably be his last outing over a mile and a half			0
but it was a different story for @entity4 , rated at 7/1 odds to win			1
@entity44 , @entity45 's stable jockey and son of the trainer , had opted to ride the equally immodestly named @entity48 , leaving the way clear for @entity50 to claim the ride on @entity4			1
@entity50 's faith in the chestnut colt paid off as he blasted home by one and a half lengths from a strong - finishing @entity56 , winner of last month 's @entity58			1
@entity59 was just a short head behind in third , with @entity48 next to finish			0
acknowledging the first part of the race had been " messy , " @entity50 said that @entity4 had quickened well rounding @entity63 , adding that he thought the horse could get an even further trip in the future			2
" he has got a real , likeable attitude , " @entity50 said			0
" you have got to give credit to the horse			0
he really toughed it out and showed a very good attitude			0
" @entity5 thanked the horse 's owners , @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
" we are so lucky to be in the position that we are in , to get such horses , " he said			0
" they are incredibly bred horses and , even before they are mated , the dream is for this to happen			0
" @entity4 's triumph gave the @entity88 trainer a second consecutive win in this race and a fourth in total , while @entity50 has previously won on @entity91 in 2010			1
a son of super sire @entity59 , @entity4 was , unusually , not raced at two years old			2
he is the first horse in such a position to win the @entity9 since 1993 , and has enjoyed an undefeated three - year - old campaign over distances from 10 furlongs to a mile and a half			2
his performance over the demanding @entity101 course on just his third start suggests there could be plenty more to come from a horse whose very name seems to betoken greatness .			0

@entity4 ends @entity13 's hopes of @entity23
rated at 7/1 odds , he wins by one and a half lengths from @entity56
2,000 *guineas* victor @entity13 , son of the 2008 victor , fades to second last
@entity9 is @entity8 's most prestigious race and second leg of @entity23
