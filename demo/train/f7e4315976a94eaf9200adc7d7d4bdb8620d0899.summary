-- eighteen - year - old @entity1 , charged with a crime for having sex with a 14 - year - old girl , rejected a deal friday that would have required her to plead guilty to child abuse , according to @entity1 's attorney			1
@entity1 was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of the 14 - year - old went to authorities			1
@entity1 's family says their relationship was consensual , but in @entity17 a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to give consent to sex			1
if @entity1 is convicted , she could go to prison for 15 years -- a reality that touched off a maelstrom of controversy across the country this past week			2
the case became widely known when @entity1 's family began an online campaign in defense of their daughter			1
the plea deal from the @entity32 prosecutor 's office would have required @entity1 to plead no contest to child abuse , spend two years " on community control , " which usually involves strict supervision , followed by one year of probation			1
according to the plea deal document , during her probation , @entity1 would have had to agree to stay away from the 14 - year - old , and to provide her probation officer with immediate access to her @entity44 and telephone communication			1
read the report , offer in a statement saying that @entity1 was rejecting the plea deal , her attorney , @entity49 , wrote : " this is a situation of two teenagers who happen to be of the same sex involved in a relationship			1
if this case involved a boy and girl , there would be no media attention to this case			2
" our client is a model citizen			2
she has been placed in an environment of school with her classmates where they go to school together , have lunch together , and play on the same team and are allowed to have communication and contact without barriers			2
then when something develops between the two as a result of this environment created by the state , it leads to criminal prosecution			0
" " if this incident occurred 108 days earlier when she was 17 , we would n't even be here , " the attorney wrote			0
the parents of the young girl friday evening said they are prepared to go forward with the case			1
his daughter 's innocence was taken away , @entity84 told @entity0 affiliate @entity87			1
" there deserves some type of punishment for that			0
" the office of state attorney @entity93 said it tendered an " extremely lenient plea offer in this case which would have ensured that the defendant avoided any term of incarceration and the stigma of being labeled a sex offender			1
" in fact , in all probability the defendant would have avoided being a convicted felon , " the statement continued			0
@entity93 will prepare for a @entity107 trial			0
earlier this week , @entity1 cried in front of news crews			0
" i 'm scared of losing my life , the rest of my life , " she said , " not being able to go to college or be around kids , be around my sisters and my family			0
" in response , @entity117 , the attorney for the 14 - year - old girl 's family , said they had been hoping the case would be resolved by now			1
now the 14 - year - old girl may have to take the witness stand if the case goes to court , @entity117 said			1
" no parent wants their child to have to testify in court , but unfortunately the reality of our system is we have a system where a defendant has the right to have all the witnesses present			0
it 's just the aspect of our law , " @entity117 said			1
" it 's a difficult process but it 's a necessary process in our system of justice			1
" a case catches fire on @entity145 the case has been a lightning rod for controversy after @entity1 's family went public on @entity145 , describing their daughter 's case and essentially accusing the victim 's family of going after their daughter because she is gay			1
the victim 's family said that is n't true ; they are only trying to protect their 14 - year - old			1
the @entity162 has spoken out in defense of @entity1 and an online petition by @entity165 had attracted some 279,000 signatures by friday evening			0
they say the punishment does not equal the crime			0
despite the online furor , a case like this is n't all that unusual , said @entity173 , president of the @entity174 , a national professional group			0
" prosecutors get these kinds of cases all the time , and it 's almost always parents who come to them saying that something like this has happened , " said @entity173 , who worked as a trial attorney in @entity176 for 10 years and focused on prosecuting sex crimes for four years			1
the amount of difference between the alleged perpetrator 's age and the victim 's age weighs heavily in whether a prosecutor moves forward on a case , he said			1
" if you had an 18 - and 17 - year - old , there may be some investigation , " he said			1
" if the 17 - year - old says it was consensual , that would probably be the end of it and you would n't have charges			1
" but in this case , 18 and 14 is a wide gap , he said			1
" according to law in @entity17 , this is a crime			1
" it does n't matter -- and should n't matter -- what people in an online community who do n't have the investigative details of a case believe , he said			0
he drew a comparison to the @entity219 case currently under way in @entity221			0
many people -- even those on the jury -- said they could n't conceive how a petite woman who claimed she 'd been the victim of domestic violence could repeatedly stab her boyfriend , as she admits doing			0
" as a prosecutor you can not be influenced by anything other than the facts , " he said			2
while some have suggested this case is being handled differently because it involves two females , @entity32 sheriff @entity235 said that has nothing to do with it			0
" if this was an 18 - year - old male and that was a 14 - year - old girl , it would have been prosecuted the same way , " he said			1
parents of girl , 14 , say they are protecting her at trial , the prosecutor is likely to try to put on witnesses who can show that the 14 - year - old was damaged psychologically by engaging in sex at such a young age , and that she would n't have normally done such a thing			1
in an earlier interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity87 , @entity84 and @entity253 insisted that the girls ' gender has nothing to do with the case			0
they are concerned about ages			0
" our daughter was 14 , and this girl was 18 , " said @entity84			1
according to the @entity264 , they twice warned @entity1 to stop			0
" i had another adult , who is a mother , she came to me and said , ' ms. @entity253 , you need to know this			0
' she said , ' we told ms. @entity1 to leave your daughter alone but they are in a relationship			2
and , she 's 18			2
' " @entity253 said she was shocked			0
her daughter was just too young , she thought			2
the 14 - year - old began to act out , the @entity264 told @entity87			1
then one weekend morning the @entity264 went to their daughter 's bedroom and discovered she was missing			1
they panicked , thinking someone took their daughter or that she was hurt			2
" her running away was the furthest thing from our mind , " said @entity84			0
" we thought ... you hear about kids getting abducted from their homes			0
" but they later learned that @entity1 had picked their daughter up , they told @entity87			2
" we had no other alternative but to turn to the law , use it basically as a last resort , " @entity84 said			0
bloggers have called @entity253 a gay basher and accused her of being abusive to her daughter			2
numerous news reports have asked whether the @entity264 went after the teen because of her sexual orientation			1
but @entity84 says her goal is to protect her 14 - year - old , and she will not relent			1
" i will be an advocate of what she needs , " the mother told @entity87			0
" the stories that people are saying ... i love my daughter			2
... i 'm willing to do whatever to protect her			2
" " this whole story about you blaming @entity310 for making your daughter gay ... where did that come from ? " a reporter asked the parents			1
" i do n't know			0
it did n't come from us			0
that 's not how we feel , " @entity84 answered			2
still , @entity1 's supporters say she is being prosecuted because she was in a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex			1
a @entity145 support page the @entity322 set up called " @entity323 " has gathered more than 47,000 names			0
not everyone who is posting online might have the facts of the case			0
a glance at postings on @entity145 and @entity330 show that some people are getting the ages of the girls wrong			0
others have posted erroneously that @entity1 is being prosecuted for numerous other charges			2
regardless , everyone seems upset about the effect a felony child abuse conviction would have on @entity1 , if she agreed to the plea deal			1
@entity173 told @entity0 that a felony child abuse conviction would mean that @entity1 would have to disclose her felony conviction on employment applications and she could never serve on a jury			0
she would be prohibited from voting for a period of time , though each state has different time frames for that rule , the attorney said			0
she may not be able to secure student loans either , he said , and she might not be allowed to adopt or obtain a childcare license			0
@entity49 , @entity1 's attorney , had earlier asked that the charges be reduced to a misdemeanor			1
" this is a life sentence for behavior that is all too common , whether male , female , gay , straight , " @entity49 said at a wednesday news conference			0
" high school relationships may be fleeting , " she said , " but felony convictions are forever			0
" @entity0 's @entity362 and @entity363 contributed to this report .			2
