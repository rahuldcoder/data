@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 leapt out of a black suv near a high cliff overlooking the @entity6 , dashed to the edge of a boulder and scanned the river that divides her country from another			1
it was a quiet friday afternoon in this border town where immigrants routinely sneak across the river in inflatable rafts , climb a ravine and seek shelter in a local church			2
but at this moment , there was little more to see on the @entity22 side than some fishermen casting rods and a few horses snacking near the river			0
" today it 's dead , " said @entity3 , a @entity27 congresswoman from @entity28 , sounding disappointed			1
she blamed the stillness on the presence of a hand - held @entity2 camera			0
" i think it 's quiet because the cameras are here			2
because more than anything , the criminal cartel worries about and fears the wrath of the @entity39 people , " @entity3 said			1
" they 're crooks , they 're villains , but they 're businessmen			0
and that 's why they fear the @entity2 cameras			2
" she was joined by her friend , @entity47 @entity46 rep. @entity46 , on a boulder above the river			1
the duo represent a coalition of @entity53 lawmakers who are staunchly opposed to any legislative action on immigration that would offer lawful status to immigrants living in the @entity39 illegally			2
while they do n't hold much official sway in @entity61 € ” neither chair a congressional committee and @entity3 plans to exit @entity64 in @entity65 € ” they do play an outsized role in amplifying conservative messaging			1
they are prolific fundraisers and enjoy widespread support among the @entity27 's @entity71 base			0
@entity3 raised her profile in 2011 when she launched a brief presidential bid			1
as a veteran congressman from @entity47 , the state that holds the first electoral contest of the presidential calendar , @entity46 also has the ear of the nation 's top @entity27			1
and both are known to make inflammatory statements , a practice that gives them a platform in both conservative and liberal media			0
they arrived in @entity1 a day after president @entity85 announced a controversial plan to invite certain immigrants living in the @entity39 illegally to " come out of the shadows " with an offer for temporary legal status to some who pass background checks and pay back taxes			1
the president said he was acting in the absence of congressional action since the @entity27 - led @entity53 had failed to take a vote on a bipartisan immigration reform bill the @entity99 - controlled @entity98 passed in 2013			0
the announcement outraged republicans , who argue that he 's overstepping the bounds of his office			1
house speaker @entity105 labeled him " emperor @entity85 " and one rank - and - file @entity27 , rep. @entity110 , suggested the president could face impeachment and even prison time for his decision			2
not to be outdone , @entity3 and @entity46 , representatives of districts that both lie more than 1,000 miles to @entity0 's north , wanted to be some of the first lawmakers on the border to respond			1
the spot they chose to visit , a @entity6 overlook near a bridge that connects these two countries , is one they know well			0
the duo visited this exact place in july , when they took cell phone video of what they said showed a pregnant woman crossing the river			0
" it just occurred to me , " @entity46 said on his second trip here , " the pregnant mother who was put off on the side here , she surely had the baby			2
that little baby is an @entity39 citizen			0
last night @entity85 gave that little baby 's mother amnesty			1
" @entity46 's claim about the woman is n't accurate : to receive legal status under @entity85 's new plan , immigrants must have lived in the @entity39 for a minimum of five years			1
the woman in his story , which occurred over the summer , would not qualify			0
in response to @entity85 's action , @entity3 and @entity46 want @entity64 to pass a resolution of disapproval , followed by a vote to censure him			1
then they want to send an appropriations bill to the @entity53 that excludes money necessary to carry out his plan , a strategy that @entity27 @entity53 and @entity98 leaders support			0
@entity46 did n't rule out impeachment down the line			2
" let 's hope that we never have to answer that question , " he told @entity2			0
" let 's hope that we can do the most reasonable things that we can do first			0
" watch : @entity2 's tense encounter at the border			2
as for a solution to the nation 's illegal immigration problem , @entity46 has proposed a three - tiered fence system that could span the length of the 2,000 - mile border			1
after surveying the border , @entity46 opened the hatch of his suv and pulled out a worn piece of paper that revealed a mock - up of a concrete fence system he designed in his free time			1
" i constructed that fence on the floor of the @entity53 , " he said			0
" it 's kicking around on @entity189			0
" @entity46 's not joking			1
in 2006 , he constructed a scale model of the fence he designed live on @entity192 , complete with miniature barbed wire and cardboard to represent the dirt			0
when asked about critics who argue a border - length fence would be costly and nearly impossible to build in entirety , @entity46 compared it to the @entity200 , a project intended to keep out invading armies that cost the lives of thousands of @entity205 workers to build			1
" there were plenty of @entity205 left over , " @entity46 said			2
the fence idea , however , would potentially only solve part of the problem			0
even if the border were completely secured , an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would still would remain in the @entity39			0
for @entity27 who routinely rail against offering so - called " amnesty " to these people , they have little to say about what to do with them			0
even @entity46 , who has built his career on railing against immigration , initially skirted the question			1
finally , after multiple attempts for clarity , he conceded that he did n't feel it was the government 's responsibility to address them			0
" we do not have a moral obligation to bring people out of the shadows , " @entity46 said			1
" they came here to live in the shadows , that 's their choice			2
so this idea that we 've identified people that are living in the shadows and say ' we 're going to come find you and bring you out of the shadows -- we 're not called to do that			1
" with dusk approaching and no crossings to be found , @entity46 and @entity3 loaded back into their suv and drove east toward @entity245 , where they met with border control agents at a @entity249 outpost			1
after the long day , they congressional day - trippers capped their adventure at a local @entity22 restaurant over plates of enchiladas and a round of margaritas			0
on the rocks and with salt , of course .			0

@entity3 and @entity46 traveled to the border together
they were there a day after @entity85 's immigration announcement
