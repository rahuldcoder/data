" @entity2 is expanding its relentless use of cluster munitions , a banned weapon , and civilians are paying the price with their lives and limbs , " said @entity122 , director of the arms division at @entity105			2

@entity2 is not one of the 111 states worldwide that have signed up to the @entity207 , which bans their use			0
