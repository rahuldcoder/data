-- there are myriad ways to scrawl out the @entity4 language : loopy and slanting letters , tight and focused penmanship , and the ever - present chicken scratch , to name only a few			1
this was readily apparent when @entity0 solicited handwriting samples from @entity10 as part of the cultural census			1
some submitters favored the clean and simple script that denotes years of penmanship practice			0
others had messy lettering and sentences tracing defiant diagonal trajectories off their guidelines			0
in the era before the printing press , handwriting was a highly specialized and labor - intensive monastic discipline , one undertaken only by those who had committed their lives to the church			1
scribes worked painstakingly in a scriptorium , a room connected to a monastery 's library where transcribers would spend their entire workday ensconced in one of the many cubiclelike recesses lining the walls			0
there , they inscribed letter after letter on sheets of parchment for months ( or years ) at a time -- all to produce a single book or manuscript			1
in the opinion of @entity50 , associate professor of @entity4 at @entity51 in @entity52 , the history of handwriting is a perfect encapsulation of how the collision between the secular and the sacred has informed our literary traditions			1
" it 's impossible to say how many different styles of handwriting there were , " he said			1
" each monastery would have its own scriptorium , if it was not extraordinarily poor			0
they had to reproduce the service books that they were wearing out			0
some became specialists in doing this for other monasteries that were not as good at it			0
it takes a long time to produce manuscript books			1
" the leaders of the scriptorium were looking for people who cared enough about books and writing to dedicate their entire lives to the process , " he said			1
" these skills were something that could carry you through your whole life			0
once you learned how to do this , you were n't going to ever be sent out into the fields to mow hay or to plow			0
books became the labor that you gave to @entity91			1
" in all three of the @entity93 faiths -- @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 -- handwriting is inexorably connected to religion and the worship of @entity91			1
the scribe 's duties were among the most sacred of religious tasks			2
" the real purpose of writing was to propagate the word of @entity91 , and to regulate the worship of @entity91 , " @entity50 said			1
" that 's what kept handwriting alive , and why it was taught as a vocation			2
" computers and calligraphy : long - lost twins ? a fitting analogy to the manuscript process is , ironically enough , computer programming			1
though the two disciplines are separated by more than a millennium of history , they share fascinating similarities and parallels in their evolution , @entity50 said			1
" who programs their own computer any more ? in the olden days , when ( @entity130 ) @entity129 and ( @entity130 ) @entity131 were out in the garage doing their thing , everyone had to program their own computer , " @entity50 said			2
" that was the scriptorium of the modern era			0
now we hire scribes to program for us			0
modern computer users are in the ' @entity143 ' era			2
the new scribe is the poor , underpaid and underappreciated programmer who 's cranking out @entity147 revisions			0
" in the early era , while scribes were still working to produce books , before the printing press , you just hired a scribe if you were rich , " he continued			1
" even people who were literate did n't bother to write their own letters			0
" indeed , until the mid- 15th century , handwriting remained a specialized vocation mostly reserved for the church and the aristocratic classes			1
only specialists could decode the then - standard gothic script style , because only specialists needed to do so			2
@entity165 lettering is famous for its complex and ornate style , which can be extremely confusing to the uninitiated			0
every serious work of the time , including @entity170 's legendary " @entity169 , " employed this script			0
then , as the @entity175 movement began to take root in @entity177 , @entity173 writers began to revive @entity179 lettering , a form of script predating the gothic style			0
@entity183 sought to apply @entity175 logic and critique to ancient texts , making the writing more digestible and accessible to a wider audience			2
their ultimate goal was the " wider distribution of their manuscript works about the pagan classics as well as to challenge @entity196 religious orthodoxy , " @entity50 said			2
carolingian script -- being much simpler , cleaner and easier to read than @entity165 -- suited the @entity183 ' purposes , and was popular enough to become the next step in the evolution of @entity4 writing			1
and just as with computers , this increased user - friendliness led to a massive proliferation of styles and formats			2
" after that last burst of clarity , once literacy spreads beyond professional scribes to ordinary readers like you and me , manuscript writing becomes distorted and stretched out by the very difficult - to - read early modern cursive script of the 15th to 17th century , " he said			1
" this also leads to an explosion of different handwriting styles , the results of which you 're seeing today			2
look at modern writers ' cursive signatures , and you 're looking at a late form of this popularized script			0
" where the sacred and the secular meet indeed , the history of handwriting can be summed up by this constant interplay and between script 's religious roots and its secular applications			1
" literally , it 's the power to control the pen , and the power to control what the pen perpetuates , " @entity50 said			0
" people 's interest in this debate about cursive handwriting , typing , texting and other incarnations of the language -- this is proof that these things still have the power to move us			0
it 's the surest evidence you need for the importance of handwriting to the culture			0

before printing press , handwriting a specialized , labor - intensive monastic discipline
handwriting history shows how collision between secular , sacred informs literary traditions
" the real purpose of writing was to propagate the word of @entity91 , " @entity4 professor says
ironically , manuscript process and computer programming share parallels in evolution
