-- the @entity1 have pulled out of the bidding process for both the 2018 and 2022 @entity3 because of financial concerns during the current economic downturn			1
the @entity6 will not be returning to @entity1 after the country pulled out of the buidding process			1
in a statement on their official web site , the federation said : " the decision is based on two premises : the global economic environment and the investment required in infrastructure			0
" the outlook regarding the global economic environment does not allow the country 's authorities -- neither at federal nor local government level -- to commit funds towards the necessary works that will be required			0
" the federation added that it would be " practically impossible " to find the public and private investment required to bring the country 's stadia up to scratch in time to stage the event			0
" in @entity1 we do have a sufficient number of stadia to stage the contest , but the majority of these were built several years ago to meet old @entity39 requirements , " the statement continued			2
@entity1 , who hosted the @entity6 in 1970 and 1986 , were always considered outsiders in the 2018/2022 tender			1
with the neighbouring @entity44 putting together an impressive bid and the 2014 edition being staged in @entity47 , it was always unlikely that @entity39 would opt for more than one country in the @entity49 when voting on the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 events			2
the other bidders include @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , while @entity58 and @entity59 have tabled a joint bid , as have @entity61 and the @entity62			0
@entity63 and @entity64 will compete with the other eight bids to host the @entity66 , with @entity39 set to decide on the hosts of both events in december 2010			0
@entity39 secretary general @entity69 added : " even though @entity1 , one of the biggest football nations on earth and host of two @entity74 , has finally opted to withdraw its bid to stage a third edition , @entity39 wishes to thank the whole @entity78 football family for having taken part in this process			1
" we obviously fully respect this decision and are very much looking forward to continued cooperation with the @entity1 as another very nice goal approaches , namely the @entity85 2011 , for which the preparations are well on track			2

@entity1 pull out of the bidding process to stage the 2018 and 2022 @entity3
the @entity1 *blamed* financial concerns for their decision
@entity1 were always considered one of the outsiders in the 2018/2022 tender
