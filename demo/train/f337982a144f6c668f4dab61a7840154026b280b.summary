@entity0 -- a landmark ruling which could change the way top - level @entity5 football matches are broadcast and sold by television companies was made on tuesday			1
the @entity7 said that soccer fans have the right to watch sport franchises , such as the @entity11 , on a range of @entity5 broadcasters rather than solely via the rights holder designated for each national territory			1
the court said in a statement : " a system of licenses for the broadcasting of football matches which grants broadcasters territorial exclusivity on a member state basis and which prohibits television viewers from watching the broadcasts with a decoder card in other member states is contrary to @entity28 law			1
" since its launch in 1992 , the @entity11 has sold exclusive match rights to a small number of television networks per national territory , a business model which has seen it become one of the richest in the world -- generating an estimated $ 5.3 billion in income , according to @entity39 newspaper @entity38			1
can football chants ever go too far ? but the ruling -- in response to a long - running case by @entity44 against a @entity39 pub landlady who broadcast a @entity47 match feed -- now means that consumers could buy decoder boxes from satellite broadcasters from other nations , at a cheaper price , to watch the games they are interested in			1
@entity44 , which paid a combined $ 2.73 billion with @entity54 to be the main rights owner for the @entity11 in the @entity39 , saw its share price drop 3 % on news of the statement			1
" it will have implications for how rights are sold across @entity5 in future , which we are considering , " a @entity44 spokesman told @entity1			1
" as a broadcaster , it will remain our aim to secure high - quality content for our customers based on the rights available to us			0
" the ruling 's effect could be far reaching if the value of football rights were to be diminished			2
the large amount paid to the @entity11 has seen record amounts of prize money given to top - flight @entity79 clubs such as @entity80 and @entity81 -- finance which has subsequently been used to build new stadia and attract some of the world 's best players			1
" this could drive a coach and horses through @entity44 's business model for broadcasting of @entity11 matches , " according to @entity92 of intellectual property law specialist @entity93 , based in @entity0			1
" there is every prospect they will find fewer people willing to pay for licenses to broadcast @entity11 matches if for a little effort they can get the same pictures via a cheaper overseas feed			1
when the deal is re-negotiated with the @entity11 it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change			2
" and if they are markedly reduced , of course , that will have a direct impact on clubs ' revenues and therefore their ability to buy and pay the salaries of top talent			2
that in turn could lead to yet more polarization between the haves and the have - nots of the @entity79 game			0
" the @entity11 said it would release a statement shortly			0
@entity122 , a sports lawyer for @entity123 based in @entity0 , told @entity1 it could affect future revenues for sport franchises across @entity5			1
" any broadcasting rights holder that intends to license rights will be bound by this ruling , it appears they will not be able to limit exclusivity to national borders and consequently the value of these rights could be limited			0
they may have to look for other models , " @entity122 said			0
" we 're not sure but we would imagine the @entity11 would possibly be considering a pan-european license to sell the same broadcasting rights to the continent			2
" but it could mean that football fans in @entity5 are able to pay less to watch the matches they want			1
" currently top - level football is sold to a host broadcaster in each @entity145 , you have only one choice of provider through which to watch the match			0
now , this ruling allows you to watch on the same terms as any other person across @entity5 , " added @entity122 , who is representing suppliers of satellite television decoders over the issue			2
" what this gives the consumer is choice because through increased competition they are able to choose cheaper providers			0
" however , the ruling could have a detrimental affect on @entity79 lower - league football , @entity92 told @entity1 , as it would circumvent the ban on saturday afternoon matches being broadcast live -- a regulation which is supposed to protect smaller clubs			0
" this would have a huge potential impact on clubs ' pricing policies as they are likely to have to reduce prices at the turnstile in order to continue to attract crowds , " @entity92 said			0
" while this is an issue for @entity11 clubs , it is likely to be much more acute for lower - league clubs who are far more at risk of reduced attendances in these circumstances			0
such clubs are also more reliant on revenue generated at the turnstiles			0
" if the net result of this is more football on the telly for fans to watch , and less money for clubs to lavish on the salaries of their top players , i think most of us would be overjoyed			2
but if we also see smaller clubs go out of business as a direct consequence , i 'm not so sure that football fans will be cheering quite so loudly			0

@entity5 court says sports fans have the right to choose how they watch matches
it could have a major impact on broadcasters which hold regional licenses for tv rights
