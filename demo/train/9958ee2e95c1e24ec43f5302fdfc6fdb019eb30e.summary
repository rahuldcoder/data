-- you 're sitting in a hip @entity3 cafe , having a fish cake and sake			0
your server has been especially attentive , so when the check arrives , you think nothing of pulling out some extra yen and leaving a healthy 20 percent tip. but suddenly things go horribly wrong : the server turns wide - eyed , becomes agitated , and walks away			0
what happened ? ! you 'll likely come across more people at a hotel that need to be tipped than anywhere else as you travel			1
tipping in @entity18 and many other @entity20 countries is simply not a way of life			1
in fact , it 's usually regarded as a vulgar display of wealth and a disregard for the culture			2
the same can be true in @entity29 and @entity30 ... though not always			0
and in the @entity33 , of course , tipping is expected ( and sometimes demanded )			1
with expectations all over the map , it 's not surprising that anxiety and confusion about whom to tip -- and how much -- are commonplace for travelers			2
so we 've done the legwork for you , talking with concierges , tourist boards , and other travelers to find out the real protocol on when ( and when not ) to reach into your wallet and how much of a tip you should give to waiters , sky caps , maids , doormen , and cabbies all over the world			0
of course , tipping is confusing enough for @entity33 traveling domestically			1
the expectation is to tip not only big but also often , from the kid handing you a @entity62 coffee at @entity63 to the multiple hotel hands that rush to open doors , carry bags , and offer an escort to the hotel room			2
go abroad and the situation changes			0
the legion of skycaps , cab drivers , bellboys , and waiters may perform the same services as their @entity33 counterparts , but they often have radically different expectations of a tip. you can credit different customs , as well as a service industry with a different wage scale			1
in the @entity33 , tips usually abet low wages			1
in other parts of the world , service employees are often paid a living wage			0
if you 're taking a taxi in @entity93 or @entity94 , for example , the driver wo n't give you the evil eye if you do n't tip -- it 's not expected			2
@entity97 's guide to tipping around the world at a hotel , you 'll encounter more people who potentially need to be tipped than anywhere else during your travels			1
in fact , there are so many people it can become confusing			2
if a doorman opens the door of your cab , another takes your bag , and a third delivers it to your room , who gets the tip ? it should be the last person in the chain -- the one who actually brings the bags to your room			0
and at checkout , only tip the one who loads your bags onto a cart and takes them out of the room			0
restaurants can be tricky , too : keep an eye out for the service charge			0
in many @entity29 countries , this charge averages 10 percent , but it 's usually included in the price of a meal			2
if it is , then do as the @entity29 do , and leave a few extra coins or round up the bill -- in cash , even if you 've paid for the meal with a credit card			2
and if you 're heading to @entity141 , @entity142 , or @entity143 , be aware that no tip is required in restaurants			0
here are some other scenarios : spa therapists : tipping 15 or 20 percent is common practice in the @entity33 but rare at any spa abroad , where a service charge is typically added to the cost of the treatment			1
if a concierge gets you theater or train tickets , or has been especially helpful during the course of your stay , then a $ 10 or $ 20 tip ( in local currency ) is in order			0
guides : booking a ski guide to take you off - piste in @entity166 , a golf pro in @entity168 , or a fishing guide in @entity170 ? all should be compensated in the 10 to 15 percent range , as they would be in the @entity33			1
a good tip on tipping ? get small bills or coins from your hotel 's front desk to make tipping easier			1
but if you have only large bills , it 's perfectly acceptable to ask a hotel porter or even a skycap for change when you give them a tip. after all , tips are a part of their business			1
they 're not embarrassed , and you need n't be either			0
and if you do n't have local currency , @entity33 greenbacks can work just as well as a " thank you " in @entity194 , @entity195 , or @entity196			1

tipping *conventions* overseas can be *vastly* different from those in the @entity33
more people at a hotel will potentially need to be tipped than anywhere else
