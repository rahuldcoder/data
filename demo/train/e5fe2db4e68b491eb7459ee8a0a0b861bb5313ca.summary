@entity0 -- letting openly gay or lesbian troops serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the @entity10 armed forces , a major @entity5 review has found , several sources familiar with the results told @entity1 tuesday			1
putting an end to " do n't ask , do n't tell " would have " some limited and isolated disruption to unit cohesion and retention , " the year - long study found , but the effects would not be long - lasting or widespread			1
there will be some strong minority opposition , particularly in the @entity19 and some combat arms specialist units , said the chairs of the study , defense department general counsel @entity22 and @entity24 gen. @entity23			2
as many as 40 to 60 percent of troops in those units were against changing the 17 - year - old policy that lets gay and lesbian troops serve as long as their sexual orientation is secret			1
overall opposition throughout the military was about 30 percent -- roughly the same as it is in @entity10 as a whole , according to recent findings from @entity35 and the @entity36			2
top administration and military officials are briefing the @entity39 on tuesday on the results of the @entity5 review			1
@entity22 told members of @entity44 on tuesday that he thought " do n't ask , do n't tell " could be repealed even while the @entity10 is at war , sources said			2
the @entity5 believes that the study is " the largest , most comprehensive review of a personnel policy matter which the @entity5 has ever undertaken , " a defense official close to the process said			1
more than nine out of 10 troops said their unit 's ability to work with someone they thought was gay or lesbian was very good , good , or neither good nor bad			0
the authors of the report say gay and lesbian troops would continue to be discreet about their personal lives , even with a repeal , based on observations of workplaces in civilian society			1
the authors said they did hear a large number of religious and morally based objections to homosexuality			0
troops would not be asked to change their beliefs , and their the views should not be downplayed , the authors said in their remarks to @entity44 , even as they pointed out that troops already work and fight alongside people with other faiths and beliefs			0
the authors outlined a number of recommendations for effectively handling the repeal , including leaders making clear what is expected of troops in the field			2
although the report will say it is not necessary to change standards of conduct extensively , some new guidance on conduct will be necessary			2
the authors will also recommend that those previously removed from the military under " do n't ask , do n't tell " be allowed to reapply under the same criteria as anyone else seeking to rejoin the military			1
even with a repeal , not all benefits will be available to gay service members and their partners because of the @entity98			2
the recommendations are based on surveys , focus groups and face - to - face meetings at bases around the world and even a carefully controlled effort to communicate anonymously with homosexuals serving in the military			1
the @entity5 sent surveys to 400,000 troops and got about 115,000 responses			1
it sent separate questionnaires to 150,000 military spouses and got 44,000 back			2
the @entity5 also set up a website for service members who wanted to comment			1
that effort elicited 72,000 responses			0
and the @entity5 held meetings at 51 @entity10 military bases around the world where 24,000 more troops discussed the issue			1
officials preparing the report also went to the service academies to hear from staff , faculty and students			2
key senators fired the warning shots for what could be a bitter debate in the chamber as the week began			0
" the system is working , " sen. @entity131 , @entity132 , said on @entity1 's " @entity133 " on sunday			0
" the military is at its highest point in recruitment , in retention , in professionalism , in capability			2
so to somehow allege that this policy has been damaging the military is simply false			1
" sen. @entity142 , @entity143 , shot back on " @entity144 , " saying that " gay members of the military have served for decades , and there has n't been a problem with our military being the finest in the world			1
... we should move forward to make sure that any person who stands up and says , ' i 'm willing to die for our country ' can do so with honor			0
" on thursday , the committee will hear from defense secretary @entity158 and adm. @entity159 , chairman of the @entity160			0
on friday , it will hear from the top brass of the @entity24 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity19			2
@entity131 , the ranking @entity165 on the committee , will undoubtedly ask why a survey of active duty military and families -- a central part of the report -- did not directly ask whether they supported changing the present policy but focused instead on how it should be changed			1
the former presidential contender wrote a letter to @entity158 about this in september			0
in a response in october , @entity158 told @entity131 that it was not part of the charter of the @entity5 's so - called working group to poll the troops on whether the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy should be repealed			1
" i do not believe that military policy decisions should -- on this or any other subject -- be subject to referendum of service members , " @entity158 wrote			1
his letter to @entity131 has not been released , but a @entity5 source confirmed the accuracy of the quote			1
@entity158 said the survey will allow him , @entity159 and the chiefs of the individual services to understand how a policy change may affect " unit cohesion , military readiness and effectiveness , recruiting and retention and family readiness			2
" outside the military , @entity10 are overwhelmingly in favor of repealing the @entity206 - era law			1
a @entity36 survey released monday indicated that a majority of @entity10 say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces			0
according to the poll , 58 percent of the public approves of allowing homosexuals to serve openly , with 27 percent saying they are opposed			0
a @entity35 poll conducted earlier in november indicated that more than seven in 10 @entity10 said that people who are openly gay or lesbian should be allowed to serve in the military , with 23 percent opposed			0
despite public opinion on the side of repeal supporters , the heads of the four military branches have either directly opposed or been unenthusiastic about the policy change , at least until the @entity5 report was finished and released			1
@entity227 commandant @entity227 has said that he opposes the change while the @entity10 is fighting in @entity229 because of its potential negative effect on unit cohesion			0
he will be joined on the second day of hearings by another @entity19 , the vice chairman of the @entity160 , @entity234 gen. @entity234			0
gen. @entity235 , the @entity24 chief of staff , has said he is on board with @entity158 in considering the effect of the repeal			0
but committee members may remind him of something he told them earlier			0
" i do have serious concerns about the impact of the repeal of the law on a force that 's fully engaged in two wars and has been at war for eight and a half years , " @entity235 said this year			1
once the hearings are over , the spotlight will turn to senate majority leader @entity251			0
he will decide how the issue will move forward , whether to keep it part of the @entity255 or whether to strip it off for a separate vote			0
but the calendar could be the biggest factor weighing on whether the law is repealed or upheld			0
with just weeks left for this @entity44 with its significant @entity263 majority , the leadership will need to decide whether it has the time , amid other priorities it wants considered , to mire the @entity39 in debate about " do n't ask , do n't tell			0
" @entity1 's @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 contributed to this report .			0

military brass appear before the @entity278
