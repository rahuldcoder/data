the thing about the old card game of @entity2 is that anything can happen			2
in @entity7 's case , he got drenched with water			2
the " @entity11 " actor , appearing on " @entity10 , " took on the host in @entity2 , in which the competitors turn over playing cards , with the higher card designated the winner			1
in the @entity20 battle , there was an extra twist : after each card was turned , the winner got to throw a glass of water at the loser			1
at the conclusion , the person with the most wins got to soak the other with a water cannon			0
@entity7 held his own in the early going , but things did n't turn out well for the @entity35 actor			0
perhaps things go better in " @entity11 , " which opens friday .			0

@entity7 and @entity39 play @entity2
the pair turned over playing cards ; winner threw water at loser
