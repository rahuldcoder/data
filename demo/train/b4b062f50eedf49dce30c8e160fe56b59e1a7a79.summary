-- the @entity2 administration said over the weekend that it would not support legislation mandating changes to internet infrastructure to fight online copyright and trademark infringement			1
" proposed laws must not tamper with the technical architecture of the internet through manipulation of the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , a foundation of internet security , " the administration said in a statement on saturday			1
" our analysis of the @entity14 filtering provisions in some proposed legislation suggests that they pose a real risk to cybersecurity and yet leave contraband goods and services accessible online			2
we must avoid legislation that drives users to dangerous , unreliable @entity14 servers and puts next - generation security policies , such as the deployment of @entity30 , at risk			0
" the announcement follows a whirlwind week in which leaders in the @entity34 and @entity35 , apparently buckling to widespread pressure , announced they would at least temporarily remove @entity14 - redirecting requirements in the @entity39 in the @entity35 and the @entity40 in the @entity34			1
the @entity34 move likely signals that @entity42 chairman @entity41 ( @entity43 ) and @entity45 chairman rep. @entity44 ( @entity46 ) would not likely re-introduce the @entity14 redirecting provisions in their bills			1
the @entity14 - redirecting provisions in both bills were designed to prevent @entity52 citizens from visiting sites the attorney general maintains are dedicated to infringing activities			2
the @entity2 administration 's announcement appears to have conceded to opposition from security experts who say the plan would sabotage @entity52 government - approved efforts to secure dns against hackers and break the @entity65 's unified naming system by introducing lies into infrastructure			1
the government is agreeing with experts who maintain that the @entity40 and @entity39 and the @entity35 's @entity39 would break the @entity65 's universal character and hamper @entity52 government - supported efforts to roll out @entity30 , which is intended to prevent hackers from hijacking the net through fake @entity14 entries			1
however , both bills essentially grant the government the authority to bring lawsuits against so - called rogue websites and obtain court orders requiring search engines like @entity83 to stop displaying links to them			0
they would allow rights holders to seek court orders instructing online ad services and credit card companies from partnering with the infringing sites			0
the administration 's announcement was unclear on whether it would support those provisions			1
the @entity34 announcement was penned by @entity96 , the @entity34 copyright czar ; @entity99 @entity52 chief technology officer ; and @entity100 , special assistant to the president for cybersecurity			2
@entity104 , a @entity52 @entity105 president , urged lawmakers to move forward on the bills without the @entity14 provisions , saying it was " much needed legislation			0
" @entity110 , deputy legal director of digital rights group , @entity112 , said the @entity34 statement underscored that the @entity2 administration has concluded that the legislation " poses real risks to the security and stability of the internet			1
" rep. @entity120 ( @entity121 ) was scheduled to conduct a hearing wednesday on the cybersecurity issue before the @entity124			0
@entity120 , the committee 's chairman , has called prominent internet security experts and others to testify about the security ramifications of @entity14 redirecting			0
but in response to the @entity34 announcement , that hearing has been tentatively postponed			2
among those summoned by @entity120 was @entity133 , a former @entity135 administration @entity134 policy director , who has said tinkering with the @entity14 " would do great damage to internet security			0
