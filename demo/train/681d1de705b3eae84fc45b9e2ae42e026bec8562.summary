-- @entity1 is n't the sort of comedian who typically apologizes for anything			1
his hit @entity7 series " @entity8 " frequently explores potentially offensive territory with jokes that some would consider misogynistic or racist , and that his fans find hilarious			0
but it seems @entity1 firmly strayed over the line during a recent live appearance			1
the comedian tweeted an apology and a link to a blogger 's account of his recent stand - up performance			1
" all the out of context misquotes aside , i 'd like to sincerely apologize , " @entity1 wrote			2
the original anonymous " friend of a friend " account would be too sketchy to use for a source if not for @entity1 's tweet acknowledging there is some substance to it			0
so keeping in mind that @entity1 says he was misquoted , the original account was by a female audience member who says she was unfamiliar with @entity1 's act when she caught his performance at the @entity35			1
she claims , " @entity1 [ started ] making some very generalizing , declarative statements about rape jokes always being funny , how can a rape joke not be funny , rape is hilarious			2
" the audience member felt " provoked " and says she yelled out , " actually , rape jokes are never funny ! " continues the account : " after i called out to him , @entity1 paused for a moment			0
then , he says , ' would n't it be funny if that girl got raped by like , 5 guys right now ? like right now ? what if a bunch of guys just raped her ... ' and i , completely stunned and finding it hard to process what was happening but knowing i needed to get out of there , immediately nudged my friend , who was also completely stunned , and we high - tailed it out of there ... i should probably add that having to basically flee while @entity1 was enthusing about how hilarious it would be if i was gang - raped in that small , claustrophobic room was pretty viscerally terrifying ... " @entity1 tweeted : " the point i was making before i was heckled is there are awful things in the world but you can still make jokes about them , " then added : " on a lighter note tonight 's new episode of @entity8 will be featuring clowns			1
