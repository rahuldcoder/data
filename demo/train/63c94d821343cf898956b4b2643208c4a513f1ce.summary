the @entity1 administration fiddled while @entity2 burned and four @entity3 died			1
late last week , @entity4 of @entity5 reported that @entity7 operators caught in the attack in @entity2 requested military backup but were denied by higher headquarters			1
if true , this would exhibit fatal inaction and negligence on the part of the administration or the military 's chain of command , or worse , some sort of cover - up			0
on friday , president @entity1 was asked directly by @entity21 's @entity20 's @entity19 whether our forces were denied backup during the attack			1
the president dodged the first question			0
@entity28 followed up , " were they denied requests for help during the attack ? " " well , we are finding out exactly what happened , " the president responded			1
" i can tell you , as i 've said over the last couple of months since this happened , the minute i found out what was happening , i gave three very clear directives			0
number one , make sure that we are securing our personnel and doing whatever we need to			0
" this is different from what the president said in his @entity47 speech on september 12 , when he mentioned nothing about securing personnel the evening of the attack , or what he said to " @entity52 " or @entity53 in the weeks after the attack			1
we now know that president @entity1 met with defense secretary @entity55 and vice president @entity56 in the @entity57 at 5 p.m. et on the night of the attack			1
we also know that the first e-mail announcing the attack came in at 4:05 pm et , about a half hour after the attack started , and that there was a drone overhead monitoring the attack and diplomatic security official @entity66 was monitoring the audio feed of the attack in real time in @entity69			0
that night , the commander 's @entity70 , a special rescue team of commandos , was moved from @entity74 to @entity75 , @entity76 , about a two - hour flight from @entity2			1
also that evening , a " @entity80 " ( @entity80 ) of @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , was deployed to protect the @entity78 in @entity79			0
the @entity84 was aware of the attack and put forces into motion			0
all information seems to indicate president @entity1 or the highest - ranking officials in the @entity90 and @entity84 knew of the attack the same evening it occurred			1
which begs the all - important question : why was no additional military aid sent to secure our personnel , like the president claimed he directed ? shortly after the fighting started in @entity2 , the embassy in @entity79 ( 400 miles away ) sent its own separate aid , dispatching an aircraft carrying 22 men			1
they did n't arrive in @entity2 until hours into the battle and were not nearly as qualified or as equipped as the @entity105 standing by in @entity74			2
the battle raged for seven hours , resulting in the death of four @entity3 , including ambassador @entity108			1
it finally ended at dawn the next day when @entity111 militia forces showed up to aid the @entity3			2
asked to explain the inaction on the part of the @entity84 , @entity55 said , " the basic principle is you do n't deploy forces into harm 's way without knowing what 's going on , without having some real - time information about what 's taking place			0
" contrary to @entity55 's claim , we know with certainty that there was real - time information coming into @entity69 and the @entity84 during the attack			2
we are therefore left with two conflicting explanation 's for the administration 's inaction -- either the president 's directive to secure our personnel was n't heeded , or he did n't exactly give such a directive			1
after all , as former @entity81 captain and former assistant secretary of defense , @entity138 , has so well chronicled , directives of such serious importance would be recorded and sent throughout the chain of command			0
the administration insists that aid was not declined			0
" neither the president nor anyone in the @entity90 denied any requests for assistance in @entity2 , " @entity144 spokesman @entity143 told @entity145 this past saturday			2
we will wait and see what unravels in the coming days , but regardless , the public deserves to know why , with real - time intelligence of the attack , @entity55 and defense officials did not immediately send military aid to secure our personnel			1
it 's been more than a month since the @entity2 attacks and many of the crucial details are still unknown			2
some of the mainstream media have been reticent to cover in - depth the story in @entity2			2
since the second presidential debate , @entity162 has been noticeably silent on @entity111 ; he should n't be			0
without the @entity164 @entity90 investigating it , one wonders whether @entity2 would be a story at all			2
the death of four @entity3 at the hands of terrorists deserves serious and sustained attention			1
@entity171 is the best disinfectant			0
the administration 's first explanation , a spontaneous mob reaction to a @entity177 video , has already been shattered			0
now we are left putting together the real story piece by piece			0
either there was serious malfeasance on the part of this administration or a knowing cover up with shifting stories and blame			0
either way , the @entity3 people deserve to know the full story of the disaster in @entity2 .			1

@entity192 : president @entity1 needs to come clean about the @entity2 disaster
@entity192 : it appears that high - ranking officials knew about the attack the night it happened
he asks whether the president tried to secure @entity3 personnel
@entity192 : the death of four @entity3 at the hands of terrorists deserves serious *scrutiny*
