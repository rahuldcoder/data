the heat inside the small medical clinic is stifling			2
an occasional breeze from an open window provides the only relief			2
a dozen lethargic children , their ribs exposed and twig - like arms outstretched , lay on beds covered by mosquito nets			2
i accompany @entity12 , a doctor with the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , as he checks on patients in a health clinic located in the densely populated @entity16 , near the @entity18 capital of @entity19			1
@entity16 has been hard hit by @entity18 's deepening hunger crisis and as elsewhere in the country the crisis is having an especially devastating impact on children			1
dr. @entity12 kneels in front of @entity26 , a ghost of a child whose loose skin sags over a skeletal frame			2
she is 16 months old and weighs only a little over 9 pounds ( 4 kg )			2
in addition to being severely malnourished , @entity32 is suffering from pneumonia and anemia that have ravaged her weakened immune system			0
@entity32 was rushed to the clinic after she was found by @entity13 volunteers who travel throughout @entity16 district to identify malnourished children and inform villagers about the help available at the health clinic			1
" if she had stayed in the village , she would have died for sure , " dr. @entity12 says			0
he instructs @entity32 's mother , who has come to the clinic with her daughter , on how to feed the girl nutritionally fortified peanut paste			0
although malnutrition is not unknown in @entity18 -- in the past decade , the country has faced three droughts which all led to major food shortages -- this year the country has struggled to cope with a prolonged drought and food crisis that is affecting large areas of the @entity59 region of @entity60			1
the crisis has been made worse by a spreading internal conflict			1
@entity64 militant groups with ties to @entity66 control about two - thirds of @entity18 after hijacking a secular rebellion by @entity69 in the north at the start of this year and seizing more territory in the wake of a march 22 military coup , which toppled the president based in @entity19			1

the remaining 120,000 are internally displaced			0
@entity32 's mother , @entity86 , explains that food in her village ran out months ago			1
" we are farmers and normally grow peanuts and millet , but we have nothing to eat now , " she says			0
" i have five children to feed and one more on the way			0
" two weeks after being admitted to the clinic , @entity32 seems to be out of danger			0
although still shockingly thin , her protein levels are up and the edema , a swelling caused by the build - up of fluid beneath the skin , has disappeared			0
@entity104 : find out how you can help an hour 's drive south of the @entity19 , in the village of @entity108 , i meet a group of farmers			1
they take me to a small hut used to store grain			0
@entity115 , a 50 - year - old father of eight , shines a flashlight through a small window			0
" this time last year it was almost full with millet , " he tells me			0
" we have used up all of our reserves and wo n't have any millet until the next harvest in january or february			0
" in the meantime , @entity115 says , three families comprising some 30 people will have to survive on a small quantity of corn and , money permitting , the occasional serving of fried fish			2
" it wo n't be enough , " he adds , shaking his head			0
" the months ahead will be very hard			2
" despite the vast need , international aid efforts in @entity18 have been hampered by political chaos and uncertainty , and in the conflict - ridden north , by @entity143 extremists who have prevented outsiders from operating in the region			1
however , @entity13 staff members who are natives of the north have managed to deliver vital aid to displaced people			1

these intrepid aid workers are distributing water purification kits and conducting hygiene promotion campaigns			0
still , many people continue to lack clean water , putting them at high risk of cholera			2
the @entity18 people i meet express sadness and disbelief over the severity and rapidity of the humanitarian crisis in a country long viewed as stable			1
" it 's a difficult time for everyone , but especially the children , " says @entity149			0
" we 're doing our best to serve the needs of the @entity18 and help them get through these multiple crises			1
