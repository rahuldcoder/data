-- the nomination of @entity2 to fill the seat of retiring @entity5 @entity4 has caused quite a stir on the political left and right , as operatives on both sides try to ascertain exactly where she stands			2
but it has also opened another fissure in the complex relationship that exists between black organizational leaders and president @entity17 , the nation 's first @entity18 - @entity18 president			1
over the past year we have seen criticisms leveled by grass - roots activists , civil rights groups and the @entity24			1
but instead of taking on the president , the beefs are largely aimed at " those around the president			0
" in previous administrations , these same individuals would n't have hesitated to call out presidents @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 or @entity34			1
why the hesitance ? because they also understand that a direct attack on president @entity17 could hurt them in two ways : they could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president 's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from @entity47			1
even among @entity18 commentators , columnists and radio and tv show hosts , if you are too harsh on president @entity17 , the backlash has been swift and vicious			1
the organizations know this , and trust me , the @entity54 knows this , and has used it to its advantage			0
that 's why i call it the @entity17 - @entity60			1
i 've been told countless times by folks on both sides that @entity17 ca n't be seen as favoring african - americans over others , and his @entity54 has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race			1
as a result , black civil rights leaders and prominent @entity69 have largely bitten their tongues , unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions			2
instead , they quietly fume , mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones			0
yet i have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for			2
i 've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of @entity69 to hold on to the @entity54 and @entity87			1
the nomination of @entity2 has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship , because this is the second time in a year that president @entity17 has made a @entity5 appointment and his administration did n't seriously consider an @entity18 - @entity18 woman for the job			1
the nomination of @entity96 certainly was historic in that she became the first @entity97 to sit on the high court , and it was embraced by civil rights groups			1
yet this time , for highly qualified @entity18 female judges , such as @entity101 , the retired chief justice of the @entity102 @entity5 , to never make the cut for a face - to - face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders i 've talked with over the last several days			1
what 's the big deal about including a black woman ? a @entity69 pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic - gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it 's vital for @entity17 to appeal to them			1
when @entity17 was behind sen. @entity117 in the polls , it was because black women had n't embraced him yet			1
when they did , the race changed			0
the uneasiness with @entity2 's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at @entity128 , which was followed by the @entity54 pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the @entity128 faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions			0
they were quick to blast out blogs , columns and articles written by african - americans at @entity128 to make clear @entity2 is a major advocate of diversity			2
when a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the @entity54 on tuesday with senior adviser @entity143 , i was told " more listening than talking " was done by the administration			2
civil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process , and were expected to rubber stamp the choice			2
when @entity2 's nomination was unveiled monday , the only prominent african - americans in attendance were @entity151 , a @entity128 professor who taught both @entity153 , and @entity154 , president of the @entity155			2
that 's a stark contrast to @entity96 's unveiling , when a number of civil rights leaders were there to back her bid			1
that 's why if you look at the public statements released this week by the @entity165 , the @entity166 and others , they are more neutral on @entity2 's appointment , saying they look forward to hearing more about her views on a variety of issues as the nomination plays out			0
folks , that 's lukewarm at best			0
i 've heard the previous complaints that congressional and civil rights leaders have been ignored by @entity54 chief of staff @entity179 , with one saying he has never attended a meeting with them ( " even @entity31 sent @entity183 to meet with us , " one leader told me )			2
and that extends to others surrounding the president in various parts of the @entity54			0
" these problems are valid and big , and we can not let them off the hook , " i was told by one frustrated organizational head			0
yet this time is different			0
@entity54 officials would quickly suggest that they are on excellent terms with the rev. @entity198 , but this goes beyond him			0
the rev. @entity201 is clearly on the outs with this administration , as seen in his banishment from the @entity205			0
but this contentious relationship is with civil rights , religious , economic and social justice officials			0
and it 's getting worse			0
one civil rights leader opined that president @entity17 is " losing his emotional connection with black leadership and black voters			1
" this has huge ramifications for the president and his agenda , because @entity69 are facing a major battle to hold on to the @entity54 and @entity87 in november			1
a @entity222 / @entity221 poll released thursday shows that voters are split over who should control @entity225 -- democrats and the @entity47 both got 44 percent			0
but of those most interested in the midterm elections , @entity47 garnered 56 percent to 36 percent for @entity69			0
yet according to a study released in april by the @entity235 , a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on african - americans , upwards of 80 percent of black voters say they are very likely to vote in november			2
the group surveyed 500 african - americans in @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241			2
what helped catapult president @entity17 into the @entity54 was a high black turnout , especially in the @entity241 , and he garnered 95 percent of the black vote			1
a drop of 10 to 15 percent by black voters for @entity69 in november would be catastrophic			0
as the @entity2 nomination goes forward , @entity54 officials have told me they expect no problems from civil rights groups			0
that may be the case			0
but the distance is growing between this president and what many figured are his natural allies			1
in a year when you have energized your enemies , the last thing you need is to push away your friends			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			1

@entity265 : twice @entity17 has n't seriously considered an @entity18 - @entity18 woman for high court
this has ticked off a number of leaders @entity265 has talked with
@entity265 : distance growing between @entity17 and many of his *presumed* natural allies
some leaders may not help @entity278 , @entity87 *candidates* , says @entity265
