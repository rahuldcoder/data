one person dies every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose in the @entity2			0
in an effort to combat " misuse and abuse , " the @entity3 is proposing new restrictions that would change regulations for some of the most commonly prescribed narcotic painkillers on the market			1
the @entity3 's latest proposal would specifically affect hydrocodone combination pills , also known as opioids , which combine hydrocodone with less potent painkillers such as acetaminophen			1
one example is the drug vicodin			0
currently labeled as @entity23 drugs , these opioids would , if the reclassification proposal is accepted , be labeled as @entity24 this means patients would have to have a written prescription from a doctor -- instead of a prescription submitted orally over the phone -- to access the drugs			1
and refills would be prohibited ; patients would have to check in with the doctor to get another prescription			2
a @entity36 classification would also put manufacturing quotas in place for these hydrocodone products			2
pure hydrocodone is already a @entity36 substance			0
drugs are categorized into one of five " schedules " by the @entity45 based on " whether they have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the @entity2 , their relative abuse potential and their likelihood of causing dependence when abused			1
" other drugs , such as @entity53 and morphine , are also labeled as @entity24 " when you wonder why your dentist gives you 40 hydrocodone for a toothache , or your knee doctor prescribes far more than he should , that 's because they 're under the impression that it 's not addictive as @entity70 , " dr. @entity55 , president of physicians for @entity57 , told @entity58 in january when an @entity3 advisory panel first urged the administration to recommend tighter restrictions			1
" that 's completely false			0
" in an online statement posted thursday , the @entity3 said it " has become increasingly concerned about the abuse and misuse of opioid products , which have sadly reached epidemic proportions in certain parts of the @entity2			1
" approximately 80 % of the world 's pain pills are consumed in the @entity2 , according to 2011 congressional testimony from the @entity81 of @entity82			0
since 1999 , sales of prescription painkillers in the @entity2 have quadrupled			0
so have the number of fatal poisonings from prescription painkillers			0
almost twice as many people abuse prescription drugs as the number of people abusing cocaine , heroin , hallucinogens and inhalants combined , the @entity45 says			2
report : states failing to curb prescription abuse " truth is , it is easier for a doctor to write a prescription than to explore other effective options to combat pain , " @entity58 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity98 wrote in an editorial			0
" and it is easier for patients to take those prescription pills than to search for alternatives themselves			0
both those things must absolutely change			0
" the @entity3 argues it did not come to its decision lightly , saying it conducted a " thorough and careful analysis of extensive scientific literature , review of hundreds of public comments on the issue , and several public meetings " in an effort to ensure that future drugs are " properly prescribed and appropriately used by the patients who need them most			1
" the @entity3 's proposal is scheduled to be submitted to the @entity124 by early december , but the @entity45 has the final decision on whether to reclassify the drugs			1
a spokesman for the @entity45 told @entity58 it would be premature to speak about the @entity3 's recommendation at this time			2
in september , the @entity3 took another step to reduce painkiller abuse with new labeling regulations , which are set to go into effect at the end of this year			1
currently , the labels on the drugs say they are for " the relief of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring continuous , around - the - clock opioid treatment for an extended period of time			2
" the new labels will say the drugs should be used only when " alternative treatment options are inadequate			0
" the @entity3 said it hopes the changes will result in a larger conversation about pain management between patients and doctors .			1
