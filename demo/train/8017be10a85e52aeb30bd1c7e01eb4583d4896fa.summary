" the first half of the seventh , and final , season of " @entity3 " ends sunday night with the characters continuing to grope with a new world -- one with a computer in its center			1
the computer may not be @entity9 , and the world is a far cry from the fictional future of " 2001 : a space odyssey , " but as the show 's many references to that film have made clear , the characters are in transit , trying to get their bearings			1
it 's a mad , mad , mad , ' @entity3 ' world what direction will they go ? you 've got @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , who has spent these early months of 1969 demoted from creative director to copywriter ( copywriter ! ) in hopes of forcing him out of @entity3 & partners altogether			1
he 's been spending his weeks jetting back and forth between the agency in @entity33 and @entity34 , where his wife , @entity35 , has been pursuing her acting career			2
as a couple , they 're adrift			2
indeed , about the only time this season @entity24 's felt the grounding of family is during an outing with daughter @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , which ended with an actual profession of love , and a trip to @entity50 with @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and @entity53 ( @entity54 )			1
and @entity51 ? she 's a manager , essentially no. 2 to the grouchy and limited new creative director , @entity55 ( @entity56 )			2
she 's smarter than he is but gets no respect			2
between spending his nights with his orgiastic hippie friends and his days wondering about life , @entity59 ( @entity60 ) has practically checked out			0
@entity64 ( @entity65 ) is a figurehead			0
the guy pulling the strings appears to be @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , who 's as sleek and deadly as a certain " 2001 " computer			2
no wonder @entity74 ( @entity73 ) cut off his nipple			0
it 's almost the only way to relieve the pressure			0
the reviews for this year have ranged from respectful to laudatory			0
even though ratings have been down from last season , there 's a sense that " @entity3 " has found its footing again			1
about the only episode that really took hits was " @entity87 , " which had the most heavy - handed references to " 2001 " -- but , then again , what other show would bother with such references at all ? " @entity3 " being " @entity3 , " there are all kinds of theories about how this half - season will conclude			1
@entity35 is going to cross paths with @entity94 ; @entity24 will mount an office coup			0
you have to wonder how the moon landing will figure into things -- especially since it appears the series ' timeline is nearing july 1969			0
fans , however , will have to hang on			0
the second half wo n't air until next spring			1
the series could end on a down note , but keep in mind : in 1969 , miracles do happen			0
