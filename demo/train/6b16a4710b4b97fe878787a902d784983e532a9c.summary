-- a 24 - year - old surfer was killed last weekend in a shark attack off the coast of @entity4 , marking the fifth such reported incident in ten months			1
the deaths have reopened the debate about our understanding of sharks and whether more should be done to control their population			2
how many shark attacks have occurred in @entity4 ? since 1791 , there have been 689 unprovoked attacks recorded in @entity4 by the @entity16 , 200 of which were fatal ( 29 % )			1
in the last decade , fatalities have occurred primarily in the states of @entity19 and @entity20 , with the others in @entity4 and @entity22			2
has there been a sudden increase in shark attacks in @entity4 ? " the events in @entity4 over the last two years are unusual in that they occurred in one state , " said @entity26 , curator of the @entity28 @entity16 and @entity29 at the @entity30			1
over the past century , there were five years that saw more than 10 annual fatalities , and eight years when five fatalities occurred over a two - year period , he said , citing the @entity28 @entity16			2
at the same time , " there is no scientific evidence to suggest that the shark - related fatalities in @entity4 are a reflection of an increase in the population size of white sharks , " said @entity38 , a shark biologist and founder of @entity40 , reiterating his comments after the fourth attack			1
" it is more likely a combination of factors , including more people in the water and white sharks being present around the southwest coast this time of year			0
" what brings sharks to @entity4 ? the recent attacks are believed to involve white sharks			1
for millions of years , white sharks in particular have been migrating along the coast of @entity4 between feeding and possibly mating grounds , explained @entity26			1
while they do not lie in wait for food at beaches , he said , white sharks are particularly inquisitive and will investigate floating objects , including cigarette packets , buoys , surfboards and humans			0
historically , human encounters with sharks have typically occurred during the summer , @entity26 said			0
but due to improvements in wetsuit technology , people engage in water sports outside of the summer season and for longer periods , leading to shark encounters year - round			2
should i be worried about future shark attacks ? " the chance of encountering a shark remains very low , and ... even if an encounter occurs , the chances of being attacked are very small , " said @entity26			1
over the last decade , an annual average of 16 shark encounters has been recorded , with 27 % of cases resulting in no injury or death , he said			1
comparing the figure with the annual average of 87 drowning deaths at @entity28 beaches , he commented , " people should be more concerning with swimming at a beach than being killed in a shark attack			1
" " it has been said that humans are not on the shark 's menu -- they are just in the way ! " @entity26 added			0
" history seems to support this observation			0
" " shark bite incidents are a rare occurrence and almost impossible to predict , " @entity38 said			0
" people need to realize that when they enter the water they are taking a risk -- albeit minimal -- of encountering a large predatory shark			0
" what are people doing wrong ? @entity38 urged beachgoers to have a sense of personal responsibility , as he pointed out that , " after the most recent attack , there were surfers in the water at the same beach the attack occurred , even though there were clear signs warning people not to enter the water			0
" @entity26 echoed that people should avoid areas where dangerous sharks are known to gather , as well as far - offshore areas , deep channels , drop - offs to deeper water , and areas with poor underwater visibility			0
people should swim at beaches patrolled by @entity135 and swim with companions ( although not pets , as non-aquatic animals can attract sharks			0
) the @entity140 recommends that all shark sightings should be reported to the water police			0
what is the @entity4 government doing to address the situation ? the @entity140 announced that it will spend aud 13.65m ( us $ 14m ) over five years to research shark populations and movements and improve attack response procedures			1
this includes setting up the @entity150 and extending its white shark monitoring program for two years under the unit , which includes tagging white sharks with acoustic transmitters to track their movements .			2

five deaths from unprovoked shark attacks reported within ten months in @entity4
while number of deaths is unusual , " no scientific evidence " to suggest increase in sharks
shark encounters remain very low , with annual average of 16 encounters over the last decade
government has committed us $ 14m over five years for shark attack research and *prevention*
