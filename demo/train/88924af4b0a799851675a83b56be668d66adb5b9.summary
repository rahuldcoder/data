-- @entity2 's controversial anti-gay propaganda law has sparked the " defining civil rights movement of our time " according to @entity4 athlete @entity3			1
the recently implemented law has been criticized by @entity4 president @entity9 and there have been calls by some to boycott next year 's winter olympics in the @entity2 city of @entity14			1
it bars " propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors " and so effectively prevents gay people from expressing their sexuality in public			2
" as an @entity4 who believes in freedom of speech and freedom of assembly i take huge offense that the @entity2 government is limiting their people in that way , " @entity3 told @entity0 friday			1
already a talking point at the track and field world championships in @entity31 , the issue intensified when one of @entity2 's greatest athletes , @entity32 , appeared to back her nation 's stance thursday			1
" if we allow to promote and do all this stuff on the street , we are very afraid about our nation because we consider ourselves like normal , standard people , " @entity32 said in @entity36 at a press conference			1
" we just live boys with woman , women with boys			2
" after the pole vaulter was criticized , too -- @entity3 was one of those who took offense -- she backtracked friday , claiming she had been misunderstood as @entity36 was n't her first language			1
but even before @entity32 's comments , @entity3 had stated his disapproval with the law in his blog for @entity57 -- though he promised to not discuss the subject during the championships			1
however he " could n't stay silent anymore " after watching a @entity0 story that showed two @entity2 women shoved to the ground after they appeared to kiss each other in the street			1
it was " based on nothing more than they wanted to express their love for each other , " he told @entity0			0
" i was just appalled			0
" @entity3 dedicated the silver medal he won in the 800 meters tuesday to his gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender friends in the @entity4 , @entity75 newspaper the @entity76 reported			1
" this is the defining civil rights movement of our time , " @entity3 told @entity0			1
" i just want to say in 100 years when people look back on this moment , the people who are against equality and against love are going to be remembered on the wrong side of history			0
" and i 'm honored to be standing alongside our gay and lesbian friends on the right side of history			0
" he is n't the only competitor at the world championships supporting gay rights			2
@entity95 high - jumper @entity93 and sprinter @entity96 wore rainbow - colored fingernails in their events			0
@entity99 posted a picture on her @entity102 account captioned : " nails painted in rainbow sign @entity105			0
" that prompted @entity32 to hit back			1
she complained about the @entity95 being " unrespectful to our country " and " unrespectful to our citizens because we are @entity2			1
" we have our home and everyone has to respect ( it )			0
when we arrive to different countries , we try to follow their rules			0
" @entity3 said he was trying to be respectful but felt he had to speak up			2
" i 'm a guest in this nation , " he told @entity0			0
" and if i really wanted to press this issue i could go a lot further and be assembling in the streets but i want to be respectful			0
respect the fact that there are a lot of competitors around here that still have to compete and i 'm trying to not create a huge distraction for them			0
" but at the same time , you watch that video and if that just does n't show how antiquated some people 's thoughts are on this issue , then i do n't know what does			2
" running around in circles is great			0
if you can maybe change the mind of people for the better and encourage love and equality , then that 's what this is really all about			2
