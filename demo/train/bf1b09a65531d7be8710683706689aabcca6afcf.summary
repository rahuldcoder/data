-- " yesterday is gone			2
tomorrow has not yet come			2
" -- @entity2 maybe it was because my parents were immigrants , who scraped by most of their lives and were always forced to plan for tomorrow			2
maybe it was because some of the scars from their past were too painful , and they felt those moments should be forgotten			2
it could be they felt their lives were moving so quickly that if they spent much time in the past , they would lose out on their future			2
no matter what the reason , when i told my parents we were going on a journey to the other side of the world to find our roots , they were a little skeptical			1
sure , a family medical history was important to know , but learning about our ancestors ' lives ? they were n't all that interested			1
in many ways , they believed that visiting the past would be , at best , a luxury			2
at worst , it would be a complete waste of time			0
they would be the first to tell you now it was a wonderfully transformative experience that brought three generations of our family closer together			1
as much as i thought i knew the story of my family , i really only had a few headlines			1
i did n't know the nuances , the details , the tidbits that painted a more complete picture of who we really are			0
i did n't know that my dad 's great - uncle was a freedom fighter who was jailed twice for speaking truth to power			1
i did n't know that my great - grandfather gave away all his money and land ( and a herd of buffalo ) to the priests in the north @entity62 community where he lived with his wife and five sons			0
even 100 years later , they describe him as the most charitable person who ever lived in that small town			0
i did n't know that at 6 feet 4 inches , he was able to jump over a water buffalo in one leap			0
i did n't know when my mom fled as a 5 - year - old refugee from the bloody partition in 1947 , that her @entity74 relatives all disguised themselves in the traditional garb of @entity76 to blend in and ensure their safety			0
i saw that scared little girl in my mind and better understood the remarkably resilient woman who grew up to be my mother			1
at one point during our trip , she turned to her three granddaughters and said , " i am proof that anything is possible			1
" to understand truly where you are going , it helps to understand from where you came			0
there are so many moments from our journey that i will never forget			0
there was the camel ride on @entity97 beach in @entity98 with my mom			1
for the first time , she shared some of the awful details of her life as a refugee			0
that beach was the last place she saw before leaving the war - torn country			0
another moment involved ancient scrolls that date back 40 generations			0
my father 's side of the family had its history recorded going back nearly 1,000 years -- and the look on my father 's face when he saw the scrolls for the first time will forever be seared in my mind			1
i will never forget the questions my daughters started asking -- not just the names of their ancestors , but what kind of people were they , really ? i can now honestly answer some of those questions			1
i can tell them the extraordinary story of how their grandparents met			0
it 's a tale that will inspire faith even in the most cynical of people			1
even today , many @entity62 still have arranged marriages			0
but in the mid- 1960s , my parents , two young college students , started a romance in @entity136 , @entity137 , and fell in love			1
" then you happened , " my dad told me with a smile as we stood in the exact spot they first met			0
if you are reading this , you 're probably already interested in the idea of finding your roots			2
here is what i 've learned : while the journey was life - altering , i will most remember the conversations we had along the way			1
there is something about finding your roots that fosters and nurtures family discussions that you would not otherwise have had			1
@entity2 was right : yesterday is gone			0
but i learned , along with my family , that it is very worthwhile to pay a visit every now and then .			2
