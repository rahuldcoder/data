@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 put forth a historic @entity0 membership bid for an independent state of @entity6 on friday ; a move @entity8 says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns			1
the formal application -- viewed as a largely symbolic gesture because an @entity14 veto is all but assured should the request come to a vote in the @entity17 -- drew applause in the assembly when the @entity3 leader raised the document at the podium during his speech at the 66th annual session of the @entity25			2
the time has come for a " @entity27 " to join the @entity28 in reshaping the @entity29 , he said			2
" my people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity			0
" but @entity8 prime minister @entity35 , later taking his turn to address the @entity25 , said @entity3 are looking for a " state without peace , " ignoring security concerns important to @entity8			1
he said @entity3 are not armed only with their " hopes and dreams , " as @entity2 said in his speech			1
to that he added " 10,000 missiles , and grad rockets supplied by @entity44 , not to mention the river of lethal weapons flowing into @entity47			0
" " palestinians should first make peace with @entity8 , and then get their state , " he declared , adding that peace must arrive through a two - state solution that recognizes @entity8 as a jewish state			1
if that occurs , @entity8 " will be the first " to recognize @entity3 statehood , the prime minister said			1
representatives from the @entity0 , the @entity14 , @entity57 and the @entity58 -- a group commonly referred to as the @entity61 -- discussed the request later friday , and issued a statement saying the bid is now before the @entity17			2
the group called for a " preparatory meeting , " to take place within one month and intended to outline how peace negotiations between @entity8 and @entity3 leaders might take place			1
each side would then be tasked with producing a comprehensive proposal on territory and security issues within three months , and " to have made substantial progress with six months , " the statement said			0
the timetable for an agreement is not to exceed the end of 2012 , countering any anticipation of immediate change in the region			1
the @entity17 is expected to meet monday to further discuss the issue			0
@entity2 ' speech , meanwhile , provoked cheers and chants from flag - waving @entity3 who watched the address on a big - screen television in a square in @entity89 , the @entity90			1
moments after handing over the formal letter seeking full @entity0 membership , @entity2 said @entity8 continues to stymie peace and flout international law , and he called on @entity0 to act urgently			1
" we aspire for and seek a greater and more effective role for the @entity0 in working to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region that ensures the inalienable , legitimate national rights of the @entity3 people , " said the @entity3 leader			1
his speech was closely watched across the @entity29			0
the hundreds who gathered in @entity89 greeted the news that he had formally filed the request with cheers , song and dance			0
demonstrations took place friday in @entity113 and in cities across the @entity29 as demonstrators waved @entity3 flags and chanted slogans in a show of solidarity			0
@entity14 @entity120 across the region warned citizens to avoid the expected demonstrations , saying they could turn violent with little warning			0
an increased police presence was visible in @entity126 , where the military had stockpiled riot - control gear against the possibility of greater violence			0
ahead of the speech , @entity3 youths lobbed rocks and bottles at @entity8 security forces at a @entity90 security checkpoint leading to @entity126 , a fairly routine friday occurrence			1
there were no injuries , but rock - throwing between @entity8 citizens and @entity3 in @entity142 led to three injuries , one of them fatal , according to the @entity144			1
no immediate action is expected on @entity2 ' request that @entity6 become a member state of the international body , and such a @entity0 declaration is almost certainly doomed to failure because of the @entity14 ' veto power in the @entity17			1
" peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the @entity0 , " president @entity152 said in a speech to delegates at the @entity25 earlier this week			2
" if it were that easy , it would have been accomplished by now			0
" @entity152 and @entity2 met wednesday as part of behind - the - scenes wrangling that has accompanied the controversial request			0
the @entity14 president said he supports @entity3 statehood , but reiterated a long - standing @entity14 position that @entity8 must be part of the discussions			1
@entity8 has described the bid as counterproductive , and has called for an immediate resumption of talks to begin in @entity113 and to be continued in @entity89 and @entity126			0
negotiations broke down last year			0
and while a @entity14 veto would block the bid for full @entity0 membership , the @entity25 could still vote to upgrade the status of @entity3 , who currently hold the status of non-voting observer " entity			2
" the body could change that status to permanent observer " state , " identical to the @entity186 's standing at the @entity0			2
despite a breathtaking year of change that has seen popular revolutions mark political upheaval in @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and other nations , talk of @entity3 statehood dominated the @entity25 's session this week			0
" the membership effort sends a strong message by @entity2 to @entity3 that he is working to advance the @entity3 ' cause , " said @entity197 , a senior fellow for @entity29 studies at the @entity199 " right now , he 's thinking about his domestic political situation in order to maintain his position , " @entity197 said			2
" so he 's not eaten alive			0
" @entity206 , the dominant of two @entity3 political groups , has maintained that neither a @entity0 application nor direct negotiations with @entity8 would provide the @entity3 people " with what they 're looking for			1
" " @entity2 ' emotional speech succeeded in moving people 's feelings but his description of @entity3 suffering is different from reality , " said @entity206 spokesman @entity213			1
@entity206 controls @entity47 while @entity2 ' @entity221 organization holds the @entity90			2
@entity1 's @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0

it is time for a " @entity27 , " president @entity2 tells the @entity0
@entity3 want " state without peace , " @entity8 prime minister @entity35 argues
the quartet issues a timetable for an agreement not to exceed the end of 2012
@entity206 spokesman says @entity2 ' solution is not what @entity3 are looking for
