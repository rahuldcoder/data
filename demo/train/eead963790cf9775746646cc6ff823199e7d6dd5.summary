the brazen terrorist assault on @entity2 's largest @entity1 that began near midnight sunday left almost everybody stunned			1
it was the @entity2 @entity5 's biggest strike on state security apparatus -- in terms of human casualties -- and is a reminder of the massive security challenge that comes from affiliates of @entity12 holed up in the mountainous @entity2 - @entity14 border terrain			1
of the 28 dead , 10 were attackers who were killed during a firefight which latest several hours			2
almost all of the suspected gunmen were reportedly wearing suicide vests , devices usually worn by terrorists on termination missions			0
military officials said two of the terrorists had detonated suicide vests			0
by putting down the attackers , the security forces most probably preempted a big hostage - taking too ; reports the terrorists had foodstuffs like dates , chickpeas , hand - grenades and petrol bombs suggest they came for the long haul			0
what was the motive for the attack ? as usual , the outlawed @entity40 ( @entity40 ) claimed responsibility for the @entity1 carnage			1
" this was revenge for @entity45 's martyrdom " ( @entity45 was killed in a @entity47 drone strike in november , 2013 ) , and a warning against the impending military operation the government is preparing against the " helpless and innocent tribes in @entity55 , " a @entity40 statement sent to media via email said			1
in an earlier message on their @entity58 page , the @entity40 said : " the biggest reason for attacking @entity1 airport is because it serves as the biggest air logistics center supplying goods for the @entity64 ' war in @entity14 and @entity2 , " referring to the @entity65 which handles the @entity14 - bound @entity47 - @entity67 cargo			1
is the first such assault @entity40 made a similar claim following a dramatic raid on @entity72 's @entity71 on december 15 , 2012			2
the group also took responsibility for similar commando raids on the @entity77 airbase @entity76 near @entity1 in may 2011 , followed by a deadly assault on a @entity2 air force base at @entity80 , 70 kilometers north of the capital , in august 2012			1
all three resulted in damage to several air - surveillance and combat aircraft , including a multi-million dollar @entity87 surveillance aircraft			0
the @entity40 justified the three attacks as " revenge " for the may 2 , 2011 secret @entity47 raid that killed @entity91 in his @entity93 compound			1
at the early stage of investigations , a number of questions and theories can be raised			0
were attackers trying to discredit @entity2 ? the @entity40 again appears to be at the center of a terrorist pattern that ostensibly aims to hurt he country 's economic interests and isolate it internationally			1
following a brazen daylight attack on the visiting @entity108 cricket team in march 2009 , for instance , all foreign cricket teams refused to visit @entity2 , thus bringing an end to international cricket in the country			2
" the only message flowing from these strikes is that foreigners and foreign airlines should not fly into @entity2 , " @entity113 , a retired general told me			2
he also recalled the coldblooded execution on june 23 , 2013 , of 10 foreign tourists in an unprecedented attack in the @entity122 of @entity123 , one of the highest peaks in the world			0
the nighttime raid at a height of over 4,000 feet killed three @entity128 , two @entity129 , one @entity130 , two @entity131 , one @entity132 , one @entity133 and their @entity2 guide -- in what was the worst attack on foreigners in @entity2 in a decade			1
what was the role of foreign fighters in the @entity1 attack ? major general @entity140 , the head of the paramilitary outfit @entity141 , who led the operation , hinted at the possible involvement of @entity145 militants in the deadly attack			2
" from their appearances they look like @entity145 but we will wait for dna tests to say something with authority , " @entity140 responded when asked whether foreign terrorists carried out the assault			0
and this is not the first time officials named @entity145 as part of an extremely well - coordinated strike			0
the @entity40 appears to enjoy active support of fighters that belong to the @entity161 ( @entity161 ) , a dissident group that escaped persecution in @entity145 and settled down in the mountainous region of @entity55 between @entity2 and @entity14 following the @entity5 regime 's defeat in december 2011			1
particularly since the killing of its leader @entity167 in an august 2009 drone strike , the @entity161 has increasingly gravitated towards @entity12 central and acted as its militant arm against the @entity2 security apparatus , which it sees as the major stumbling block in its fight for survival in @entity2			1
did the attackers have inside information ? @entity40 and its foreign affiliates draw support from " the enemy within			0
" " such a coordinated attack is not possible without inside information , " @entity181 , a former @entity2 @entity182 commodore told me			2
" we really have to think very seriously of purging the security apparatus of such inside supporters , " he said			0
what was the influence of recent peace talks ? the recent breakdown of @entity40 talks with government also revived a new string of attacks against security and strategic targets ; despite a several week engagement , the talks offered by prime minister @entity200 in an attempt to improve internal security led nowhere			0
the government and the security forces found it impossible to accept @entity40 demands like enforcement of @entity209 across the board , withdrawal of the army from the tribal regions and a peace zone for itself			0
and soon after the stalemate became evident , the army began pounding @entity161 and @entity218 hideouts in the @entity55 mountains , where the @entity40 provides them social cover			0
the @entity222 ( @entity222 ) represents @entity223 who want an independent @entity224 and have been reportedly waging a war on @entity131 interests from the @entity2 - @entity14 border region			2
was the attack linked to a " proxy war ? " some officials tie the @entity40 - led terror campaign to the proxy war that both @entity2 and @entity233 have been involved in for quite some time			1
some @entity2 accuse the @entity40 of being an @entity233 proxy , while among the @entity233 and @entity14 establishments there are those who treat @entity14 's @entity5 , particularly the @entity237 , as @entity2 proxies			1
often , @entity233 officials blame attacks on @entity233 interests on the @entity2 spy agency @entity242 , including the suicide strike at @entity233 's consulate in the western @entity14 city of @entity246 last month			1
what does the attack reveal about security in @entity1 ? lastly , the @entity1 attack , too , exposed the weaknesses in the early warning capacity of the @entity2 security apparatus ; while forces on ground managed to engage and neutralize the attackers within five hours -- restoring air traffic by noon -- questions loom over the intelligence			1
@entity260 , a prominent security commentator based at @entity261 , wonders as to how such a big number of attackers remained undetected			0
this requires a deep introspection and represents a huge challenge for the government and the entire security agencies			0
counter-terrorism would require extremely close coordination , which could possibly help in early warning as well , he said .			0

28 people died in an attack on @entity1 's @entity1 , @entity2 's military says
@entity40 ( @entity40 ) says the attack was revenge for the killing of its leader
@entity40 leader @entity45 was killed in a @entity47 drone strike in november 2013
@entity285 says the @entity40 appears to be trying to hurt @entity2 's economic interests , isolate it
