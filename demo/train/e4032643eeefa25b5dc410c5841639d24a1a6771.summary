-- @entity1 has postponed for one day the scheduled launch of a rocket carrying a solar probe			1
the space agency plans to launch an @entity7 rocket carrying its @entity8 , which it says will study the sun " in greater detail than ever before			2
" after delaying the launch three times because of windy conditions wednesday at @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity1 said it will try again thursday , with a launch window of 10:23 a.m. to 11:23 a.m. et. " the vehicle 's flight control system sensed wind loads exceeding the limit , prompting the abrupt end to the countdown , " @entity1 said			1
the agency says the observatory will provide a better understanding of the sun and its role in space weather events such as solar flares , which can wreak havoc on @entity31			1
the observatory is designed to deliver solar images with resolution 10 times better than high - definition television , according to @entity1			1
the five - year mission " will determine how the sun 's magnetic field is generated , structured and converted into violent solar events like turbulent solar wind , solar flares and @entity41 , " according to the agency			1
the solar wind , a stream of electrically charged particles flowing out from the sun , fills the entire solar system with charged particles and magnetic fields , according to @entity1			1
solar flares are actual explosions in the sun 's atmosphere , the largest of them equal to billions of one - megaton nuclear bombs			1
and @entity41 , or @entity57 , are eruptions that launch solar material into space at a high rate of speed			2
such events can put astronauts at risk , as well as aircraft flying over @entity31 's @entity67 , and can also disrupt satellite communications , navigational systems and power grids , @entity1 said			1
in 1969 , for instance , a solar current knocked a power grid serving @entity74 , @entity75 , off - line for nine hours			2
" that 's a direct impact on life and society , " said @entity76 , director of @entity1 's @entity77			2
he is in charge of wednesday 's launch			0
in addition , changes in magnetic energy such as those around sunspots can change @entity89 signals , making them less accurate " if you 're landing a great big jet airliner in a low - visibility situation and you have one of these events that causes a misinterpretation of location by 150 to 200 yards , that 's big stuff when you 're trying to hit a runway with these instruments , " @entity76 said			1
there 's no way to predict space weather			1
officials hope the @entity8 can provide information to help change that			0
" this is the most advanced spacecraft we 've ever designed to study the sun and its dynamic behavior , " @entity76 said			0
the sun , he said , " has this trick of converting magnetic energy into other kinds of energy that can affect the @entity31			2
" " i believe we 're up to the point now where we can probably predict when something like this is more or less likely and you can at least take precautions , " @entity76 said about solar weather			2
a warning system , for example , could help power grid operators avoid an outage by taking some of the grid 's load off or finding alternative configurations			0
the sun 's effect was n't an issue for the @entity31 until the technological advances in electronics over the last hundred years , he said			2
the observatory is " going to give us good awareness of the dynamics of the sun , and we 're going to be able to make estimates on when we should take precautions with our satellites or with airline operations or with @entity142 , " @entity76 said			0
" we have an increasing pressure on science to try and predict what 's going to happen on the sun , and that 's the scientific bent of this ( @entity8 ) satellite , is to try to get a handle on it			0
" the observatory contains three major instruments that scientists believe will send data back to @entity31 for at least five years			0
the @entity156 and @entity155 and the @entity157 will allow scientists to see the sun in high resolution			2
the imaging assembly will also observe the outer layer of the sun 's atmosphere , and the @entity165 will measure its ultraviolet spectrum every 10 seconds			1
" space weather forecasting is in its infancy ... just like hurricane forecasting was years ago , " according to an article on @entity1 's web site by @entity172 , @entity8 project manager at @entity1 's @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , which developed and will manage the mission			1
" we built up experience in collecting data , designed models , tested those models and now look what we can do			0
" the observatory will snap an image of the sun in eight wavelengths every 10 seconds , @entity1 said			1
it will remain in continuous contact with a station at the @entity188 in southern @entity189			0
" the biggest challenge of this mission was the data rate , " @entity172 wrote in the article			0
" @entity8 will blast back 1.5 terabytes of information every day			0
... that 's equivalent to a half - million song downloads			0
" the observatory is the first mission of @entity1 's @entity200			1
the program is aimed at increasing understanding of the sun in order to address its effect on @entity31			0
the mission was supposed to launch in august 2008 , but scientists decided more testing was needed			0
