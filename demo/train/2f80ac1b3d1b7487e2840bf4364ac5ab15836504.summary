@entity0 -- @entity2 , who fervently pound the podium against the deficit , did n't blink friday at passing a whopping $ 287 billion business tax cut measure with no effort to pay for or offset that amount			1
@entity9 lawmakers argued the bill helps the economy , but budget - watching organizations outside @entity14 proclaimed it an irresponsible move			1
the 258 - 160 vote marked one of the largest unpaid - for measures passed by the @entity19 in years , but was also the latest sign that tax cuts are at the center of the @entity9 universe and the ballyhooed deficit fight is not on the same level as a priority			1
" @entity35 , we 're doing what we can to help ( pass jobs ) , " read the statement from @entity9 house speaker @entity28 , " passing another bill today that would create more certainty and give small business owners an incentive to invest and put more @entity33 back to work			1
" what $ 287 billion does the bill , @entity19 4718 , would make permanent something called " bonus depreciation " : a significant and recent benefit for businesses			1
bonus depreciation allows companies to deduct 50 % of the value of new equipment or assets in the year they are purchased			1
it 's considered a " bonus " because the provision provides a much greater and much faster tax benefit than traditional depreciation			2
the idea first became law under president @entity55 in 2002 , who said it was meant to be temporary			1
the tax benefit has been extended repeatedly until the end of last year			2
at that time , it expired along with a slew of other temporary tax provisions called " tax extenders " because they have gone through this process so often			2
the issue of $ 287 billion now the move by @entity2 to back $ 287 billion in tax cuts comes at a time when they are loudly questioning much smaller spending bills : the president 's request for $ 3.7 billion to respond to children crossing the border , $ 11 billion to keep highway projects afloat for less than a year and the roughly $ 35 billion @entity77 measure to revamp the veteran 's health care system			1
combined , those measures are still less than a fifth of the tax cut bill			2
" wildfire season is approaching and there are not enough resources , " said @entity85 @entity84 rep. @entity83 during friday 's debate , " our highways crumble , bridges literally fall down ... while there is so much of vital needs that we just do n't seem to have the resources to address , these same @entity2 tell us that we can afford to borrow from the @entity95 or the @entity96 to deliver ( tax cuts )			2
" should tax cuts be paid for ? " permanency is something we need to strive for , " said rep. @entity99 , @entity100 , on the @entity19 floor , arguing that if a tax provision is extended year after year , it should be made into firm law			2
but that was a change in position from february , when he and other @entity2 on the @entity109 initially proposed erasing bonus depreciation altogether , a point @entity84 stressed			0
" @entity116 gives inconsistency a bad name , " said rep. @entity112 , @entity113 , the ranking @entity114 on @entity115			0
" i want to say how appalling it is for @entity2 to come forward and say ' let 's ( push $ 287 billion ) unpaid for			0
' " conservative groups split on the question , with @entity123 urging republicans to vote " yes " and issuing a blunt statement that cut to the heart of the @entity9 argument			0
" members should not hesitate to make bonus depreciation permanent , " the political organization wrote in a statement to @entity14			0
" nor should they feel compelled to offer a " pay for " as reducing taxes does not require a budget offset			0
" that is a central point of debate , should tax cuts require an offset ? is it ok to add the cost of tax cuts to the deficit ? while @entity2 point to sweeping economic benefits , opponents insist those benefits will never materialize if the tax breaks are made permanent			0
" the temporary nature of the break may induce a modest number of firms to accelerate some purchases , " wrote @entity147 , in an analysis for the nonpartisan @entity149 that slammed the bill			0
" if , however , the tax break is permanent , then there is no incentive for firms to accelerate purchase			0
" the @entity149 called the measure " irresponsible			1
" separately , the nonpartisan @entity163 has also indicted that the tax cut loses some economic bite when made permanent			0
the conservative @entity166 objects to tax extenders in general but did not issue a statement on friday 's vote , because the organization sees it as maneuvering in a predictable battle with the @entity77			1
" the whole process is silly and everyone knows how it 's going to end , " said @entity166 's @entity173 to @entity1			0
the spokesman thinks the @entity19 and @entity77 will combine their bills and pass some form of tax extenders later this year			1
" what next ? while the vote passed with the overwhelming endorsement of @entity183 -- just two voted ' no ' -- this will not be the final version of a tax cut bill			0
the @entity77 also must ring in on how deal with the expired tax cuts			1
and as @entity173 with the @entity166 noted , @entity19 members openly are positioning for those negotiations with the @entity77			1
that could happen in the last months of the year			0
" we 'll have a good old - fashioned compromise , " said rep. @entity191 , @entity9 of @entity192 and sponsor of friday 's bill .			0

@entity28 says measure meant to help small businesses
*critics* say the measure may not get the desired effect
@entity77 must weigh in
