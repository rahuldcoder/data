-- rape has turned into a weapon of war in the @entity5 , with the number of attacks on women having grown threefold over the past few years , human rights activists said in october			2
@entity9 , senior researcher with @entity10 , told @entity11 that 200,000 women and girls have been raped in @entity14 since 1998 , and the condition of women has become more dire as the @entity5 army has pressed a military campaign against armed groups in the countryside			1
" rape is being used as a weapon of war in eastern @entity14			1
so we notice and we have documented that when armed groups walk into town , they will rape the women and girls , sometimes publicly , sometimes privately , in order to punish the local population , " she said			1
" it 's the easiest way to terrorize a community			0
" @entity14 has witnessed one of the worst humanitarian crises since @entity36 , with a death toll estimated at more than 5 million			1
most of the dead have come not from direct violence , but the consequences of the fighting : disease and starvation			1
while the war formally ended six years ago , fighting persists in eastern @entity14 , and women are paying a high price			1
" one of the other sad realities is that the majority of those who are raped are adolescent girls , 12 - year - olds , 13 - year - olds , 14 - year - olds			1
their lives are often ruined by this			0
and i think we 've got to take more seriously -- protection of civilians is not just protecting them from death			0
it 's protecting them from rape , " @entity63 said			0
there have also been reports of members of the @entity5 army , particularly high ranking officers , attacking women			1
in may , the @entity73 handed over the names of five top military officers accused of rape			0
two of the senior officers are being detained in the capital of @entity80 and the three others must report to authorities under close observation			0
still more must be done , aid groups say , starting with the establishment of a special court made up of @entity5 and international judges and prosecutors to investigate rape allegations			2
" i think they 've got to start holding to account the generals and colonels who are either themselves responsible or who allow their troops to rape			0
and so far , those are the guys that have been untouchable , " said @entity63			0
" no general has yet been held to account in @entity14 for rape , and it 's high time that that changes			1
" @entity14 has taken some measures to try to curb the sexual violence			1
in 2006 , its parliament passed a law criminalizing rape , with penalties ranging from five to 20 years			0
penalties are doubled under certain circumstances , including gang - rape and if the perpetrator is a public official			0
@entity114 's wife , @entity113 , has launched a public campaign speaking out against rapes of the nation 's women and girls			1
the army has also started a zero - tolerance campaign in which commanders have emphasized to troops that they must respect human rights and protect civilians from harm , according to the @entity73 the @entity73 maintains in @entity14 its largest peacekeeping force anywhere in the world			1
but the forces have been ineffective at stopping rape			0
@entity131 , the former head of @entity73 peacekeeping , told @entity11 that the international forces face a serious problem : too few troops assigned to the vast inaccessible reaches of eastern @entity14			2
" in the @entity139 provinces , there are 10 million people , " @entity131 said			2
" if one applied the counterinsurgency ratios that the @entity142 thinks of -- say , 20 per 1,000 -- that would mean 200,000 troops in @entity14 -- 200,000 accountable troops			1
" " the @entity73 is in a tough spot , to be frank , because if it did not give any support to the @entity5 army , probably the @entity5 army might prey even more on the population , " @entity131 said			2
part of the problem stems from the tactic applied by the @entity5 government to quell previous armed rebellions against @entity80 by incorporating insurgents into the ranks of the national army , leading to a military that paid scant attention to human rights , and the rights of women in particular			1
watch how one community is coping " what needs to be done is to have a state in @entity14 that can control its territory and that has the confidence of the people , " @entity131 said			2
" the violence in the @entity139 , the violence in @entity176 , it is the result of a vacuum , the fact that there is no administration , there is no credible state , there is no justice			0
and so that vacuum is being occupied by various militias			0
" and , unfortunately , when the @entity5 army integrates a militia without sorting between the killers and those who could be integrated , it just adds to the problem			0
" @entity189 called for international pressure to force the @entity5 army to bring abusers to justice			0
" my worst fear is that we 're going to continue to see those individuals responsible for rape being promoted			0
my hope is that the women and girls of -- of eastern @entity14 in particular -- will continue to speak out			1
i think we 've seen immense courage from those women and girls to say , ' no , we 've had enough			2

@entity10 : 200,000 women , girls raped in @entity14 since 1998
condition of women more dire as the army fights armed groups in the country
more than 5 million die in @entity14 from disease , *hunger* resulting from fighting
@entity14 has taken some measures to try to curb the sexual violence
