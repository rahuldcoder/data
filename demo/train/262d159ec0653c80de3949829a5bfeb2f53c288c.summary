-- @entity1 prepays for a rental car through @entity4 's web site			1
but when her flight is canceled , and she arrives a day late , the company charges her three times more than it originally said it would			1
is it allowed to do that ? and is there any hope for a refund ? a customer 's late arrival cost her an additional $ 1,116 for her car rental			1
q : my car rental company has more than tripled the rate it charged me , and i do n't know what to do			1
i had prepaid $ 390 for the car through @entity4 's web site			1
when my flight was canceled , i called @entity4 to tell it i could not get the car until the next day			1
i was told that my reservation would be held for 24 hours			1
i picked up the car the next day and returned it on time			1
when i dropped off the rental , a representative said the computer system was down			2
but when i got my bill the next month , there was an additional $ 1,116 charge because of the late pick up			1
i believe this additional charge to be unfair and am requesting a refund			2
i believe @entity4 should honor its promise of the prepaid amount as well as the representation that my reservation would be held for 24 hours			1
can you help ? -- @entity1 , @entity41 , @entity42 a : so @entity4 is charging you another $ 1,116 even though you rented one of its cars for one day less			1
where 's the logic in that ? the answer : it 's airline logic			2
air carriers have figured out a way to quadruple the price of a ticket depending on the time you bought it			0
so a " walk - up " fare purchased at the last minute can be hundreds , and even thousands , of dollars more expensive than an advance - purchase fare			0
but you 're getting the same seat			0
you prepaid for your rental weeks in advance -- kind of like an advance - purchase ticket			2
but when you did n't show up as expected , the system reset your rate , charging you the more expensive " walk - up " rate			0
the computer problems should have been a showstopper			0
when a representative says the system is down , you need to get a receipt , even if it 's handwritten			2
that way , if the company tries to double - dip , you can dispute the charge using the invoice as evidence that your bill was paid			0
even if you have assurances that you wo n't be billed again , it 's important to monitor your credit card			0
a car rental company is n't going to send you an e-mail letting you know that you 're being charged more			1
it 's just going to quietly take it off your credit card			0
as soon as you see a questionable charge on your card , mention it to the company or dispute it with your credit card company			0
i think you would have won a credit card dispute , by the way			0
you would have needed to show the prepaid voucher as proof that you had already paid for the rental , and the credit card company should have sided with you			0
i suggested you write a brief , polite e-mail to @entity4 , asking it to reverse the charges			1
the response ? a snippy note that said , " any changes to the basis of the reservation makes the rate subject to change , " and adding , " we are disappointed that this policy is a source of dissatisfaction for you			0
" @entity4 denied your request			2
like you , i was unhappy with the denials by phone and e-mail			0
so i contacted @entity4 for you			2
it promptly refunded the $ 1,116 it should have never charged you in the first place			1

a customer 's flight was canceled , and she arrived a day late for her car rental
she called to let @entity4 know and it said her reservation would be held
she was charged an additional $ 1,116 for the rental because of the late pick up
after *declining* a refund , @entity4 was *persuaded* to reverse the charges
