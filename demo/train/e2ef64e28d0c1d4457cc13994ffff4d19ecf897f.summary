@entity0 -- energy giant @entity2 was trying wednesday to contain a gas leak that forced the evacuation of a platform off the coast of @entity7			1
a union representing workers on the rig warned there was an " urgent need " to stop the leak , which began sunday			1
" if the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source , we could be looking at complete destruction , " said @entity14 , an official with the @entity15			1
" this is an unprecedented situation and we really are in the realms of the unknown , " @entity14 said of the leak from the @entity22 platform in the @entity23 , about 150 miles ( 240 km ) east of the @entity7 city of @entity25			1
but oceanographer @entity28 said the risk of explosion may not be as high as initially feared			1
" initially the risk of explosion was seen as being very high			2
there were reports coming through of a large gas cloud enveloping the whole rig , " he told @entity1			1
but the fact that there has been no blast when the flare on the gas rig is still burning " obviously contradicts the idea that there was a very high risk of explosion , " he said			1
" perhaps the quantity of gas is not that great as first thought , " he said			2
for the moment , the wind seems to be blowing the gas cloud away from the flare on the @entity22 rig			1
nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed sunday , @entity2 said in a statement			1
" investigations are ongoing to analyze the causes and to determine the remediation of the gas leak , " the company said			2
@entity2 confirmed there was a " sheen on the water in the vicinity of the platform , " but said there was no indication of environmental damage			2
there have been no injuries , the company said			0
@entity71 , national shipping secretary for the @entity15 , said that while the workers were safely evacuated , they are being kept in the dark about what happened			1
more information is needed on what measures are being taken to prevent such a leak occurring again , he told @entity1 , speaking from @entity81 , @entity82			2
" we really need reassurances before anyone is put back out there that the danger has been cleared up altogether , " he said			0
@entity89 partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms , @entity90 and @entity92 , as a " purely precautionary " measure , it said			0
the @entity90 crew was reduced from 90 to 38 , and the @entity92 crew is in the process of being reduced from 106 to 38			0
drilling was suspended on the @entity92 rig , @entity97 said			0
the @entity22 leak has echoes of the @entity103 spill in the @entity104 , but there are significant differences			1
the @entity22 is in significantly shallower water , which could make problems easier to fix , but it is leaking gas , rather than oil			1
gas catches fire much more easily			0
" this is nothing on the scale of the @entity104 spill two years ago , " @entity28 said			0
" this is a relatively light spill			0
the gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly			0
" but there is one parallel , he pointed out			0
" ironically , it sounds as if , just like with the @entity103 , they were closing off a well and somewhere along the line something went wrong , " he said			0
" the hope is that there is so little gas pressure in there that it will just blow itself out , " he said of the @entity22 spill			2
failing that , @entity2 may have to dig a bypass well to close off the leak from another angle , as @entity132 did with the @entity104 spill , he said			2
any effect on the environment is likely to be strictly local , he predicted			0
@entity2 's share price fell 7 % tuesday on news of the leak , but market analyst firm @entity139 said wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted			1
the company 's value continued to fall on wednesday , but not as sharply			0
it was down about 1 % from the day before as of wednesday afternoon in @entity144 , where it is traded			0
the @entity23 was the scene of the world 's worst offshore rig disaster , the @entity150 explosion , which killed 167 people in 1988 .			1
