-- it was two hours before friday 's concert , and already fans of @entity4 were tailgating in the gravel parking lot			1
not surprising since @entity4 's " @entity7 " tour has sold out in venues across the country , often in under a couple of hours			1
last week , the singer 's latest single , " @entity11 , " hit the top of the charts , marking his ninth no. 1 overall and his fifth consecutive no. 1 from the " @entity7 " album			1
@entity4 's sound is a little bit country and a little bit rock ' n ' roll			1
introspective songs such as " @entity26 " and " @entity22 " have earned him big sales numbers , but concert fans clamor for his more upbeat numbers such as " @entity29			0
" he 's also not afraid to step outside his comfort zone -- " @entity35 " was a collaboration with @entity32 that had @entity4 rapping about jumping barbed wire and lighting bonfires			1
still , it surprised more than few people in the audience friday when @entity32 appeared onstage with @entity4 during the encore to perform the hit song			1
while tour buddy @entity41 has an infectious eagerness on stage , @entity4 rarely breaks his brooding stare			1
that does n't change backstage as his tour manager brings him in			1
he 's friendly , but no overly so			1
i get the impression that manners are as ingrained in this @entity51 homeboy as deep as his music			1
the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity : @entity0 : this show in @entity57 sold out in minutes , so you had to add a second night			1
what does that tell you about your fans ? @entity4 : obviously that 's a good sign			1
we 've always made it a point to let fans know that when you come out to our shows , it 's going to be fun			2
you 're going to have a good time , and we encourage that -- probably a lot more than other people do			0
( laughs ) but that 's what you want			2
you know , people come to a show to kind of forget about whatever crappy week they had at work or school or whatever it was , and it 's our job to make sure that that 's what happens			2
@entity0 : what 's the best thing about touring with @entity41 ? @entity4 : the best thing about touring with @entity41 is just the fact that he and i are legitimately friends away from the music business			1
i think that , unlike a lot of other artists in the business , you know , he and i actually pull for each other			2
we want to see each other succeed and do well			0
there 's not a competition sort of thing there at all			2
he 's one of my best friends			1
so obviously when he 's out on stage and he 's doing his thing and you see people going crazy , that 's cool			2
it makes you feel good			0
and i think he 's the same way			2
and like i said , i legitimately like hanging out with the guy			0
he 's a lot of fun			2
we come from the same part of the country , we grew up about two hours apart from each other			2
so even though we did n't know each other until five or six years ago , we have a lot in common			0
@entity0 : @entity57 country radio has been touting @entity51 as the new capital of country music thanks to artists like you , @entity128 , the @entity129 and @entity130			1
do you think @entity132 can really be ousted ? @entity4 : i do n't know if @entity132 will ever be ousted as the @entity132			1
but i also think that here , over the last few years , @entity51 has definitely kind of risen to the top as far as the crop of young artists coming out of this area that are kind of making waves , you know ? i think for long time it was artists from @entity143 , then it was artists from @entity146			0
now it just seems like @entity51 is kind of a hotbed for that kind of thing			0
and it 's cool to be part of that fraternity a little bit			2
@entity0 : you 're elected president of the @entity157			0
what 's the first thing you do ? @entity4 : well , first of all , i would n't want to be president			1
but if i was , the first thing i 'd probably do is uh ... hm			0
let me think about this for a second			0
i 'd probably do away with , try my best to do away with taxes ( laughs )			0
but i know every politician says they 're going to do that , and they 're all liars			0
but i would actually really try to do that			0
that would be beneficial to everybody			0
or at least give a flat tax across the board -- everybody pays , you know whatever , 20 %			0
@entity0 : have to say i 'm a bit disappointed -- i was hoping for a big country party			2
@entity4 : oh , i 'd definitely turn the @entity179 into a @entity180 , for sure ! there 'd be deer heads hanging off the wall , in the @entity184			1
@entity0 : what do you always bring with you on tour ? @entity4 : i always bring my bow and arrow			1
i love to hunt so it 's always under the bus			2
i like to just get out there in the day and just shoot , backstage somewhere , and just practice doing that			0
never know when i might luck up and get an invite to go hunting somewhere too ... so i like to prepare for that			2
so i usually bring that and my golf clubs			0
@entity0 : do you have a good golf score ? @entity4 : my golf score is really bad			1
i 'm definitely not a good golfer			0
off the tee box , i can drive it about 275 , and i 'm in the fairway about 99 % of the time			0
it 's my next shot that needs work			2
@entity0 : if you had to survive on one meal for the rest of your life what would it be ? @entity4 : you know what , i 'm a steak and potatoes guy			1
so it would be a thick filet , baked potato and maybe like something else really bad for you , like fried okra			0
the fact that it 's okra makes me feel like it 's good for you -- i forget the fact that it 's fried			2
@entity0 : it seems everybody these days -- singers , actors , etc. -- has a clothing line , a perfume , a jewelry brand			1
what are you doing to expand your empire ? @entity4 : we did a deal with @entity238 where we 're kind of the face of their @entity238 retro line of clothing -- jeans , shirts			1
i got a hat deal with @entity246 , where i have my own line of cowboy hats			0
@entity41 and i both actually are part owners in a company called @entity251 , which is a hunting -- it 's a show but we also have hunting products , clothes , that kind of stuff			1
@entity0 : and do feel that 's important for you to do , or is it just something to do with your money ? @entity4 : i think it 's important to do things that you 're interested in			1
i think it 's important to have other outlets away from the music industry			1
you know , for me that 's what the hunting side of it is , just kind of a way for me to somewhat get away from the music side of it and have another outlet to kind of decompress			1
... things like that for me are kind of for sanity reasons i think more than anything else			0
and you know the other thing , with the clothes and that kind of thing -- i think when you wear the brand anyway , why not go out and try to promote it and make it as cool as you can ? the fact that i can continue to do what i 've always done and kind of become the face of that brand is to me , kind of just makes sense			0
it does n't make sense not to do it i guess			0
@entity0 : what 's left on your dream list ? @entity4 : there 's still a lot of things i 'd like to accomplish			1
there 's still a lot of artists i 'd like to work with			2
we 're in talks right now of like possibly doing a movie so we 're kind of dabbling in on the acting part of it			0
you know , i think a lot of times you just kind of wait and see what opportunities present themselves			0
my main focus was to be successful in the music business , which has always been my main focus , and i never really want to get away from that			1
but at the same time , i think it 's cool to branch out and do some other things and see if it 's something that you like			0
one day the music business , the music side of it goes away -- to have some other things that you 've kind of dabbled in that you like ... you can kind of maybe travel down that route for awhile			1
@entity0 : you 're new album comes out in october			0
what should listeners expect to hear that 's different ? @entity4 : when it comes to albums , i think it 's important to never get away completely from what got you to this point , and obviously , what 's worked for you			1
that said you do n't want to go out and continue to make the same albums over and over -- that 's going to be kind of boring too			0
so you know for me it was about going in and finding the best songs we could find and trying to put together a record that i felt like was you know , just as good if not better than the previous record			0
i think " @entity7 , " that album , was so successful , it 's going to be really hard to compare any album to that one			1
now [ i 'm ] not saying that i do n't hope this next record does n't come out and blow the doors off of that one , but you ca n't really expect that			0
you 've just kind of got to go in and make what you feel like is a great record and put it out there and hope people dig it .			0
