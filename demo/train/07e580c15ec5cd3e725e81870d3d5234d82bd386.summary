after more than 800,000 @entity2 voters said they want the island to become the 51st @entity5 state , the @entity0 is calling on lawmakers to take action			1
" @entity10 should now study the results closely , and provide the people of @entity13 with a clear path forward that lays out the means by which @entity13 themselves can determine their own status , " @entity0 spokesman @entity8 told reporters this week			1
last month 's statehood referendum in @entity13 was nonbinding , but it was the first time such a measure garnered a majority of votes ; 61 % of voters who cast ballots on that question said they supported the island commonwealth becoming a @entity5 state			1
critics say the two - part plebiscite on @entity13 's status was unclear and does n't accurately represent the will of the island			1
even the @entity0 has n't been clear about what the vote means , they say			1
" democracy should never be used to confuse people			0
... i 'm sorry they are confused in the @entity0 , " said @entity2 sen. @entity35 of the @entity36			2
the first ballot question asked @entity2 voters whether they supported the island 's status as a @entity5 commonwealth ; 54 % of them said no. in response to the second question , which asked voters to select an alternative , 61 % of those who cast ballots chose statehood , but more than 480,000 people abstained from voting on that question			1
" they could have voted for statehood , if they had really supported it , " said @entity51 , senator - elect for the @entity52 , which supports the island becoming its own sovereign republic			2
" when you combine all the votes , statehood does n't appear as the true winner in the second question about non-colonial options			2
" one thing is clear , the @entity0 spokesman said monday : @entity13 " want a resolution to the issue of the island 's political status			1
" @entity10 action in @entity73 would be necessary for @entity13 to become a state			0
@entity75 has long been a thorny issue in @entity13 , with political parties sharply divided over the matter			0
those who support statehood say last month 's vote is a sign that change is coming , despite what critics say			1
" if they do n't want to pay attention to it , let them not pay attention , " said @entity86 , @entity13 's secretary of state			0
" but the @entity0 is paying attention			0
" a law passed in 1917 made @entity13 @entity5 citizens			0
but the @entity97 island 's roughly 4 million residents can not vote for president under its status as a commonwealth , @entity13 is subject to @entity5 federal laws , though island residents are exempt from some federal taxes			2
@entity13 has a nonvoting representative in @entity10			0
after last month 's referendum , @entity86 said an economic downturn and shrinking population contributed to the support for statehood , where as referendums in 1967 , 1993 and 1998 failed			1
" i think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need , " he said			0
an exodus of residents from the island has culminated in a staggering statistic : 58 % of @entity13 live in the mainland @entity5 , @entity86 said			0
" when you have a political status that scares away half of your population , " he said , " it is time to reject that political status			0
