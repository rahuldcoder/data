-- if you have ever tried to grab a bargain that appears online , you 'll know you have to be quick			0
the business of high frequency trading -- using algorithms and superfast computers to conduct trades in a fraction of a second -- is a supercharged version of this , with the potential to execute millions of buy and sell orders electronically each day through the myriad exchanges currently in existence			1
advocates argue that high frequency trading reduces market volatility and lowers transaction costs for small investors , but others claim it is unfair on slower traders , and can lead to instability -- trading algorithms and high frequency trading were behind the " @entity25 " of may 6 2010 , when the @entity26 briefly plummeted almost 1,000 points			1
irrespective of how the popularity of high frequency trading changes in the future , this need for speed will continue to drive a technological arms race where the weapons of choice include new types of computer circuits hard - wired with dedicated trading algorithms ; new tunnels blasted through mountains to ensure more direct optic fiber connections ; new cables being laid in straighter paths across the @entity45 seabed ; and even new networks of microwave towers to profit from the speed of electromagnetic signals through air			1
and as the search for an evolutionary edge continues , " genetic " trading programs will be created that develop specific mutant offspring in response to real - time changes in market conditions			0
even long - term pension funds play the high frequency game , hence it involves us all -- whether we like it or not			1
there is one factor that limits speed : according to @entity66 , nothing can travel faster than the speed of light			0
however this leaves ample opportunity for future increases in trading speed			0
light can travel approximately one foot in a nanosecond ( a billionth of a second ) in free space , meaning that current processers , routers and switching devices have plenty of room for improvement			0
and just as faster predators in the animal kingdom catch more prey and will be less vulnerable to other predators , faster trading companies will emerge at the expense of slower ones			0
in parallel , a new form of ultrafast options market may emerge with second - scale contract times in order to hedge high frequency risk			1
however , there are two problems that make the future of high frequency trading of unique global concern , irrespective of how popular it becomes			1
the first is a scientific one : financial markets represent the largest - ever sociotechnical system in existence , with a mix of state - of - the - art communications and computational power operating at speeds approaching the natural speed limit of light			2
yet nobody , including @entity66 , has ever produced a theory that predicts what might go wrong in an ultrafast global network of interconnected machines that carry out millions of operations in the blink of an eye -- or what can be done to prevent or manage it			2
this leads to the second problem			0
how can regulators and governments possibly decide how to manage this emerging ultrafast financial jungle if nobody yet fully understands it ? my fellow researchers and i recently uncovered glimpses of what is already going wrong in the form of escalating patterns of " sub-second tsunamis			1
" these tsunamis are huge spikes and dips in the price of an individual stock			1
although the @entity25 was fast , lasting only a few minutes , these sub-second tsunamis are over in the blink of an eye -- and there are thousands of them			1
a 10 % daily change in a major stock would guarantee breaking news coverage , but these tsunamis typically send the price plummeting to almost zero			2
however they go unnoticed since the price quickly recovers as other algorithms jump in for the kill			2
their existence reveals a remarkable difference between the human trading world above the typical human response time of one second , and the all - machine ecology of trading algorithms below one second			1
just like cracks propagating in a structure prior to mechanical failure , these sub-second tsunamis escalated in the lead up to the 2008 financial meltdown			1
most importantly , the stock showing highest proliferation are the banks that are now associated with the crisis			0
yet nobody knew at the time			0
indeed our research predicts a growing zoo of such tsunamis in the future , with each species having its own characteristic twist and turns			0
governments need the financial equivalent of an air traffic control system in order to know how to manage this brave new world , and hence what rules ( if any ) to impose			1
this in turn will require a joint research program between trading houses , regulators and academics			0
however , instead of using conventional economics , the methodological approach should be built around complex adaptive systems and dynamical networks			0
generative market models must be tested in real - time against high resolution data , to see if they can reproduce the observed price exchange dynamics down to the sub-second scale			2
our own research predicts that these sub-second market movements will be neither completely unpredictable nor predictable , but will instead have pockets of predictability that come and go in particular ways			0
estimates of the market share of different trading algorithms will enable real - time system management , while ensuring that the secrecy of individual trading entities remains intact			1
without such a financial @entity210 , regulatory bodies will effectively be flying blind and may end up doing more harm than good			0
read this : how to start your own currency read this : would you bank with @entity216 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			2

high frequency trading uses algorithms to conduct trades in fractions of a second
it can cause individual stock prices to spike and dip close to zero , says @entity219
these " sub-second tsunamis " go unnoticed and are over in the blink of an eye
governments need a financial " air traffic control system " to manage this , says @entity219
