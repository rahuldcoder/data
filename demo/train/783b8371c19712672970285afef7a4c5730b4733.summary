using machine guns , sticks and anything else they could find , crowds protected the courthouse , serving as an operations center by the opposition in @entity11 , and successfully repelled @entity8 militias armed with tanks and heavy artillery , the witness said			1

" fighting also raged in the town of @entity60 , where the sounds of booms -- either aerial bombardments or heavy artillery -- could be heard echoing			0

the battles came in stark contrast to the image @entity8 's regime sought to portray in the capital , @entity0			1
throngs filled @entity74 , cheering their support of @entity8 , with some insisting they were celebrating the government 's victory in @entity11			1
a government official said @entity8 's regime was victorious in @entity67 and in @entity79 , as well			0
@entity2 was not allowed to enter @entity79 on sunday , and could not reach people inside the city			1
reports said communications had been cut off			0
@entity1 state tv also claimed that the government had gained control of the eastern port city of @entity88			1
" morning victory , oh people of @entity1			1
victory city of @entity88 from terrorist gangs , " the station said			0
witnesses in @entity88 , though , said it was still under opposition control			0
@entity48 secretary - general @entity97 talked sunday morning with @entity1 foreign minister @entity98 , appealing for an end to hostilities and discussing " the increasingly troubling humanitarian situation , " according to a statement from his office			1
the release criticized @entity8 's government for what it called " disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets			0
" after reports of the opposition successfully fighting off @entity37 forces in @entity11 , @entity1 state tv showed a graphic -- in both @entity114 and @entity115 -- saying that " strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs , who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities			1
" the report cited " military sources , " and said those cities " are being circled by the armed forces except those neighborhoods where the terrorist gangs have sought refuge			1
" while the @entity37 rally in @entity0 was crowded and boisterous -- including the sounds of car horns and celebratory gunfire -- such demonstrations do not offer a clear sign of how much support the 68 - year - old leader actually has			2

on sunday , police forces searched cars to try to ensure that no @entity148 protesters were out on the streets , though some still managed to venture out , a witness said			1

" the strife engulfing the north @entity198 nation is reverberating across the country , the region and the world			0
death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the @entity8 regime			2
the protesters are seeking the ouster of @entity8 after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring @entity211 and @entity212			0
but unlike in those countries , the uprising has turned into warfare			0
@entity216 , a fellow at the @entity218 - based @entity217 think tank who had worked closely with the @entity221 , told @entity2 's @entity222 that he felt @entity8 , his son @entity224 and their supporters would likely " fight to the death " -- meaning a prolonged war , compared to the relatively quick and peaceful political transition that happened in @entity212 and @entity211			0
even if @entity8 is somehow ousted , @entity216 predicted the violence could continue as tribes duke it out for supremacy in a nation that has few significant public institutions that could fill a potentially chaotic void			0

the council said its main missions are to represent all of @entity1 internationally , liberate the country , draft a constitution and hold elections			2
