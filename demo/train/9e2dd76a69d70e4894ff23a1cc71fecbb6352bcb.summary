@entity0 -- a new national poll indicates that white and black americans do n't see eye to eye on last month 's arrest of @entity7 professor @entity6			1
sgt. @entity8 and professor @entity6 sit for beers with the president and vice president thursday			0
the @entity13 survey released tuesday also suggests a racial divide over president @entity16 's initial comments on the incident			1
the arrest sparked a national discussion on the issue of racial profiling , which was amplified when president @entity16 weighed in on the matter			2
in a prime time news conference on july 22 , @entity16 said " the @entity25 police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home			1
" fifty - four percent of people questioned in the poll said they do n't think @entity25 , @entity31 , police office @entity8 acted " stupidly " when he arrested @entity6 at the professor 's home after @entity8 responded to a call that someone was breaking into the house			1
thirty - three percent said @entity8 did act stupidly			2
but there 's a major racial divide , with 59 percent of black respondents saying @entity8 acted stupidly compared to 29 percent of whites questioned			2
fifty - three percent of those polled felt @entity6 acted stupidly in the incident , with 30 percent saying no. broken down by race , 58 percent of whites said @entity6 acted stupidly , with african - americans split on the question : 44 percent said yes and 43 percent said no. two days after @entity16 's remarks , after criticism from police unions and after speaking with @entity8 , @entity16 said " because this has been ratcheting up , and i obviously helped to contribute ratcheting it up , i want to make clear that in my choice of words , i think , i unfortunately gave an impression that i was maligning the @entity55 or @entity56 [ @entity8 ] @entity8 specifically and i could have calibrated those words differently			1
and i told this to @entity59			0
" fifty - four percent of people questioned said they think the president acted stupidly when he commented on the @entity6 arrest , with 32 percent disagreeing			1
but again , the poll indicates a racial divide , with 63 percent of whites feeling @entity16 acted stupidly and 26 percent of black respondents agreeing			1
sixty - one percent approve of how the president has handled race relations , with 92 percent of african - americans and 56 percent of whites approving			0
did @entity16 's initial comments damage his political standing ? " one - third of whites say that @entity16 's comments about this matter made them feel less favorable toward him , compared to only 4 percent of whites who feel more favorably toward @entity16 due to his comments , " said @entity1 polling director @entity73			1
" but the majority of whites say that @entity16 's comments did not affect their views of him , and most whites approve of how @entity16 is handling race relations			1
" fifty - two percent of @entity69 feel racism among police officers is common , with 44 percent saying it 's rare			0
whites are split on that question -- 47 percent said it 's common , 49 percent said it 's rare -- with 86 percent of black respondents feeling racism among police offices is common			0
sixty - six percent of whites said a white homeowner would have been arrested for the same behavior			0
twenty - five percent of blacks agree			0
" that difference may be due to life experiences -- more than half of blacks say they have been treated unfairly by the police because of their race , but only a handful of whites report the same kind of treatment , " @entity73 said			0
the poll indicated that both blacks and whites believe friday 's " beer summit " at the @entity111 , in which @entity16 was host at a meeting with @entity6 and @entity8 , was a good idea			2
but was it a " teachable moment , " as mentioned by the president ? " not according to the public -- blacks and whites agree that the whole controversy did not teach @entity69 a lesson that will lead to better race relations , " @entity73 said			0
the @entity13 poll was conducted friday through monday ( july 31 - august 3 ) , with 1,136 adult @entity69 , including 226 african - americans and 773 whites , questioned by telephone			2
the survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample and plus or minus 6.5 percentage points for the breakdown by race .			0
