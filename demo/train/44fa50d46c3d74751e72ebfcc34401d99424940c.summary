when the @entity0 unleashed 47 @entity2 missiles on september 22 on suspected @entity4 sites to the west of @entity6 , @entity7 , one of their top targets was an unlikely figure : @entity12 , a 24 - year - old @entity13 convert from @entity14 who had become a key bomb - maker for the group			1
@entity17 suggested that @entity18 , a group of veteran core @entity21 operatives who have found sanctuary in @entity25 province and surrounding areas , was in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in the @entity29 , including against @entity0 aviation			1
among the devices @entity18 's bomb - makers were developing to try to beat airport security : bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics			1
@entity0 officials told @entity41 's @entity40 and @entity42 on wednesday that @entity43 may have been actively involved in these efforts , which also involved technology transfers from @entity21 's master bomb - maker in @entity47 , @entity48			1
in july , the @entity49 banned cell phones without electronic charge from airplane cabins in response to the intelligence , much of it fragmentary , coming in on the plans			0
but the cruise missiles in september appear to have missed their mark			0
@entity0 officials told @entity41 that @entity43 -- and @entity18 leader @entity59 , a veteran @entity60 operative once close to @entity61 -- almost certainly survived the strikes			1
it is unclear whether they were even at any of the locations that were targeted			0
that has left @entity43 free to continue plotting terrorist attacks against the @entity29			2
his knowledge of explosives , @entity71 background and access to @entity74 fighters in @entity7 makes him arguably one of the most dangerous operatives in the entire global @entity21 network			2
@entity78 rise from unlikely beginnings @entity43 was born in 1989 in a blue - collar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of @entity84 on the @entity86 coast of @entity14 , according to @entity87 a reporter with @entity88 who has extensively reported on @entity43 and shared his findings with @entity41			1
by all accounts , @entity43 had a very normal childhood			2
his father was a bus driver and his mother a secretary and committed @entity96			0
he had an elder brother who shared his passion for the @entity13 soccer team @entity99 and he got good grades at school			2
but like a significant number of others who later took the path to radicalization , his parents ' divorce when he was 13 was traumatic			0
@entity43 began acting out , and his grades at school nosedived			2
he began hanging out with a group of young @entity112 in the neighborhood who espoused a fundamentalist interpretation of @entity116			0
before he turned 14 he converted , changing his name to @entity118			0
" @entity43 was radicalized over a period of several years			1
a local imam played a key role			0
he was part of group of about a half dozen @entity112 in the town , " @entity87 told @entity41			0
by 2010 , @entity43 was on the radar screen of @entity13 security services and had made several trips to @entity128 to learn arabic and more about @entity116			1
he funded the trips by taking driving jobs			0
in april that year , he slipped away from @entity13 for good , traveling via @entity131 for the tribal areas of @entity133 , to join the jihad against @entity0 forces in @entity136			1
according to @entity87 , @entity13 intelligence established that @entity43 joined a small @entity21 subgroup known as @entity139 based in the @entity141 area			1
@entity41 understands their knowledge of his involvement in the group came partly from the interrogation of one of the group 's fighters held in @entity150			0
security sources in @entity150 confirmed the incarceration to @entity41			0
the group was led by @entity154 , a @entity156 @entity155 operative married to @entity157 , a @entity159 - @entity158 " @entity21 living legend " imprisoned for terrorism offences in @entity159 whose deceased previous husband had assassinated @entity163 , the head of the @entity165 , on @entity61 's orders two days before 9/11			2
i interviewed @entity168 and @entity154 for @entity41 in 2006			0
taking tea with a terrorist from @entity133 to @entity7 ? @entity43 first learned how to make bombs in the tribal areas of @entity133 , and over time became skilled in making explosives			2
he took on a new fighting name " @entity177 " and made several forays into @entity136 , according to @entity87			0
in september 2011 , @entity43 likely came into contact with a new recruit into the group , a @entity13 - @entity182 from @entity183 named @entity184 , who in march 2012 would kill seven , including three @entity186 schoolchildren , in a spree of shootings in southern @entity13			1
investigations shed new light on @entity183 terrorist shootings during the short time @entity184 spent with the group , he was offered explosives instruction , but instead opted for shooting practice			0
it is possible @entity43 helped inspire the terrorist shootings in southern @entity13			1
besieged in his apartment in @entity183 in a final stand before his death , @entity184 told @entity13 negotiators over a walkie - talkie that " an @entity21 brother " in @entity133 who had spent time in @entity13 helped persuade him to return to @entity13 to launch attacks			1
before returning to @entity13 , @entity184 agreed with @entity154 that the latter could claim credit for any attack he launched back in his home country , which the @entity155 operative duly did before being killed in a @entity0 drone strike later that year			1
@entity43 is believed to have left @entity133 some time in 2013 or very early 2014 , and to have traveled to @entity7 to join up with the @entity214			0
a significant number of @entity21 operatives were making the same journey , convinced that @entity7 now offered a better sanctuary away from the sight lines of @entity0 drones			1
@entity0 officials told @entity41 they believe @entity43 has been heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from @entity71 , and in planning attacks in @entity71			1
the potential threat from @entity43 is " preoccupying the entire @entity13 intelligence establishment , " @entity87 told @entity41			2
the skilled @entity13 bomb - maker has an unprecedented large potential pool of @entity74 extremists he can recruit for attacks			1
according to @entity71 counterterrorism officials , more than 3,000 @entity71 have traveled to fight in @entity7			0
the mix there of sophisticated explosive technology and @entity74 passport holders is a perfect storm that is keeping @entity74 officials up at night .			0

@entity21 bomb - maker is a @entity13 convert
@entity12 apparently escaped from @entity0 missiles
