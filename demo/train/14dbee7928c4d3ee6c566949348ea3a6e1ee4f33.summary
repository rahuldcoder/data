@entity1 , @entity0 -- when a woman dates a much older man , bystanders often speculate that she has only the most superficial of motives			1
@entity9 actress @entity8 stars in veteran @entity12 filmmaker @entity11 's " @entity10 in two			1
" in " @entity10 in two , " veteran @entity9 filmmaker @entity11 tells the story of one young woman for whom just the opposite is true			1
it stars @entity9 starlet @entity8 as a young woman who rejects the amorous advances of a flashy , wealthy man her age , in favor of a sleazy affair with a fickle , 60 year - old father figure			1
@entity8 's desire to take on the role was also motivated by the allure of a much older man : @entity11			1
" the idea of working with @entity11 was the main attraction at the beginning , " she told @entity2			1
" he is a great @entity9 director , one of the pioneers of the @entity12			1
" " the guy has so much experience			0
i felt like i was a journalist , always asking things , " continues @entity8			2
" he 's very old ... he 's been through many , many things			0
this was his 66th movie , or something like that			0
" @entity8 describes her character , @entity45 , a charming , 20 - something television weather girl , as " very naive			2
" " she falls in a trap like a poor little lamb and she gets eaten by wolves			0
" the thing is , she does n't have a dad , so she lacks affection , and sometimes that lack of affection can drive you to make mistakes			0
" i 'd say i 'm stronger than that , " says 29 year - old @entity8 , who is perhaps best - known for her provocative portrayal of a highly - sexualized teenager opposite @entity59 in @entity61 's 2003 drama , " @entity62			2
" @entity8 who is often compared with screen sirens like @entity65 and @entity66 , drew international acclaim for a series of films in 2002 and 2003 , but has recently has been taking smaller roles			2
many of the qualities that attracted @entity8 to @entity11 are similar to those that draw her on - screen alter - ego @entity75 to writer @entity76 ( @entity77 ) -- @entity79 ' knowledge of life , literature and his ability to treat her like a little girl , not as an equal			1
@entity8 says of working with @entity11 : " it was like opening a cinema book , because when you work with him he talks to you about @entity91 , he talks to you about @entity88			1
" he met everyone , so he 's full of anecdotes , so you want to know more			0
" @entity11 began his career in 1956 , earning his stripes alongside fellow @entity12 directors @entity98 and @entity97			1
he became famous in the late 1960s for suspense thrillers such as " @entity100 " ( 1969 ) and " @entity101 " ( 1971 )			0
he has continued working prolifically in film and television ever since			0
@entity11 co-wrote the screenplay for the heartbreak drama , in which @entity8 character is consistently disappointed in love and let down by the men around her , with his step - daughter , @entity109 , who also served as assistant director on the film			1
at the end of " @entity114 , " @entity8 appears on stage as a magician 's assistant , smiling in the spotlight as she hears applause rise from the audience , the attention perhaps curing her depression over lovers lost			2
she lies in a box , appearing to be cut in half , the trick functioning as an almost literal embodiment of the film 's title -- but clearly there 's more to it than meets the eye			0
" she cuts into two men first of all , and she 's also cut in two different sides of her personality , " said @entity8			2
" she has a part of shade and a part of lightness			0
" @entity8 's fate since her collaboration with @entity11 has , thankfully , been a decidedly rosier affair : since finishing " @entity10 in two , " she has starred in @entity143 's , " @entity144 , " which received more nominations than any other film at the 2009 @entity147 , @entity9 's equivalent of the @entity149			1
the indefatigable @entity11 has recently wrapped up yet another film : " @entity152 " starring @entity151			0
" @entity154 " is released in the @entity153 on 22 may 2009			0
