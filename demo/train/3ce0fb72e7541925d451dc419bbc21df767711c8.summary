-- one year ago this week , president @entity1 launched the @entity2 to find ways to get ahead of the kind of crisis we 're seeing in @entity7 , and the kind we witnessed in @entity10 and @entity11			1
the board 's aim is to shift @entity15 foreign policy away from responding to atrocities to preventing them ; to oversee the development of prevention and response policy , and to deal with urgent situations as they arise			1
the board is under the chairmanship of the @entity25 and is a result of a decades - long effort by the global anti-genocide community			1
it marks its one - year anniversary 10 years after the genocide began in @entity10 , and nearly 20 years after @entity11			0
given the changing nature of warfare , the board -- and the 12 agencies that compose it , including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , and the @entity39 -- also was charged with suggesting ways in which conflict prevention could be more nimble and effective			0
the problem , however , is that we 're still using hardware to fix a software problem			0
and we 're not particularly nimble			0
in a fast - moving , interconnected , and open - information world , anticipating and preventing armed conflict or mass atrocities requires tools that are equally as fast , flexible and high - impact as the modern perpetrators of violence			1
we do n't need new targeted sanctions programs , visa bans , or expanded military authorizations			1
these are old tools , more reflective of an outdated , hard - powered and overly militarized approach to engagement than those needed to counter 21st - century security threats			0
the tools we need are people who are well - trained , technologically connected , fully empowered and well - resourced in hot spots throughout the world			1
these people , @entity15 and local , collect our intelligence , design and inform our early warning systems , quell political unrest through diplomacy and development , and train the next generation of leaders in conflict regions to read and write , legislate and litigate , reignite broken economies and repair eroded social fabric			2
what work did we do in the last 10 years in @entity7 or @entity80 to empower civil society in conflict prevention , invest robustly in strengthening governance , access to justice and the rule of law , and expand information networks and open communication ? we did very little			0
this work -- building human capacity in countries in turmoil and expanding systems for information sharing -- is the single most cost - effective approach to atrocity prevention when the true objective is sustainable peace			2
and yet we have left meager footprints on these fronts in @entity101 or @entity102			0
as the @entity104 begins its second year , the road ahead must be redesigned to better reflect these recommendations			0
if we want to prevent more situations like @entity7 , we must work closely with @entity107 to protect or increase funding for the @entity110 's @entity109 and the @entity111 , international organizations , transition initiatives , and programs focused on access to justice , governance and security reform , human rights and social inclusion			1
how do we get @entity107 to fund this critical atrocities prevention work in the age of sequesters and cost - cutting measures ? engage the @entity15 public			1
the public will be essential for atrocities prevention efforts to succeed			2
the @entity15 public is behind us on this			2
according to a poll by the @entity128 , seven in 10 @entity15 think the @entity15 should prevent or stop genocide or mass atrocities from happening in another part of the world			1
engagement with the @entity15 public is an untapped resource of support			2
yet , a year after the board was established , a clear mechanism for civil society to engage in its work does not exist			2
we commend the @entity1 administration -- along with civil society , international institutions , think tanks and academics and activists in anti-genocide and prevention -- for their efforts to advance our national understanding of modern day conflict , and our ability to respond in a truly paradigm - shifting way			1
the @entity2 filled a major hole in @entity15 foreign policy and sets a promising trajectory for increasing the @entity15 and international community 's ability to prevent mass atrocities			1
but more work is needed			0
now it is time to take that commitment to the next level by issuing an executive order spelling out the @entity15 government 's strategy for preventing mass atrocities and the key tasks of those charged with making it happen			1
we can stop the next genocide			0
we can prevent the next violent conflict			0
but to do so , we have to commit the resources early , not after atrocities have already started			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0
