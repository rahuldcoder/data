the historian , @entity38 , told @entity39 saturday that she had bought death certificates for the children but she found that there had been no burial records			1

" in an interview with @entity9 's national broadcaster @entity77 , @entity10 said it was important that any commission investigating the graves be given " full judicial powers			0
" " i also think it 's very important that the commission be clearly separate from church / state or any other organization that was involved in it , " he told @entity77			0
" i 'm not too sure we can throw the entire blame at the church , i think that would be wrong to do that			0
there was a society in which there was a sort of collusion between the church and state institutions , " @entity10 said			0

government response minister for children and youth affairs @entity102 said in a statement wednesday that " active consideration " was being given to how to address the details that had emerged			2

' @entity134 ' the @entity32 case is the latest high - profile episode in which the state and @entity51 have been called to account over care of the most vulnerable in @entity9 society			1
a government report last year into the so - called @entity141 , run by various @entity2 orders , acknowledged that @entity9 's government sent thousands of women and girls to " harsh and physically demanding " workhouses , where they worked and lived without pay , sometimes for years			1
