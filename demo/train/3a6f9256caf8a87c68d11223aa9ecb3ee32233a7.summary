-- we are ... @entity2			1
i can not recount the thousands of times that i have proudly proclaimed that chant throughout the years			0
i belted it out as a @entity2 cheerleader , later as a proud alum standing in @entity9 among nearly 100,000 raucous fans , and more recently on saturday afternoons sitting solo in my tv room watching my @entity14 roar in those classic no - name jerseys			1
those words still give me goosebumps nearly 20 years after i left @entity17 , @entity18 , lovingly called @entity17			0
looking down from my perch on other colleges over the past decade , i 've watched major programs crumble as their dirty little secrets were revealed			0
and through all those college scandal headlines -- paying players , inflating sat scores , falsifying classroom grades -- i have held @entity2 up as a shining example of all that is good and right and pure about college sports			1
we are the good guys			0
but today , i 'm putting my pompoms down			0
i 'm done covering up @entity17 's secrets			0
and it 's time for others in the program , starting with coach @entity31 , to do the same thing			1
and then , @entity31 has got to go , immediately			1
that is the only real alternative after the shocking allegations that @entity40 , 67 -- a former assistant coach who worked with the program for more than 30 years and who was viewed by many as @entity31 's heir before he retired in 1999 -- has been charged with multiple felonies in the alleged sexual abuse of eight boys during a 15 - year period			1
prosecutors now expect that more boys will come forward with abuse claims			0
before this week , i 'd argued that @entity31 should coach until he takes his last breath			1
this year , @entity2 tied with @entity54 for the top graduation success rate among teams ranked in the october 30 @entity57 and @entity58 25 rankings , according to the @entity60			1
during his 46 - year tenure , @entity31 has had 47 academic all - americans , with 37 earning first - team honors			1
i made excuses for @entity2 in 2007 when the women 's basketball coach , @entity65 , quit after the university was sued over her " no lesbians on the team " policy			1
@entity71 , who had coached at the university for 27 years , was accused of bullying and humiliating one of her young players because she believed the girl was a lesbian			0
@entity71 's homophobic views were well - known on the team			2
still , i reasoned that she was just a rogue coach , an anomaly at the school			2
surely , her brand of bigotry was not the norm			0
right ? and i even defended @entity2 after my own ugly experience with discrimination , when an adviser for the cheerleading squad tried to force me to quit the team after i was elected by my peers as the first @entity95 - @entity94 captain			1
it was n't the only racial hatred i 'd experienced at the school			0
in the late ' 80s , it was routine to find the campus littered with leaflets from the local @entity101 telling us blacks to " go back to @entity104			0
" sometimes the writer even drew a nice little noose on the fliers			0
but i stayed at the school , kept cheering on my @entity14			2
i was proud to be there			2
plus , i reasoned that my struggles there would prepare me for the real world			0
now , i 've run out of excuses			0
according to a grand jury report , @entity31 back in 2002 was informed by a grad assistant that he had seen former @entity2 football coach @entity40 naked and forcing a boy who appeared to be about 10 - years - old to have anal sex in the showers of the school 's sports complex			1
@entity31 reportedly told his boss , athletic director @entity121 , but it 's unclear whether the coach did anything further to follow up on the shocking report			1
and incredibly no one , @entity31 or his superiors , reported this alleged incident to the authorities			1
those of us who have been on campus find it a joke that coach @entity31 would now say that he reported the incident to his bosses			1
what bosses ? everyone knows @entity31 had as much or more power on that campus than anyone to make things happen , including the president			2
it 's absolutely unforgivable if @entity31 did nothing but pass the information up the chain			2
in fact , even after this incident was reported , @entity40 still had the keys to the complex and free rein to bring boys he mentored at his nonprofit foundation , the @entity152 , to visit the campus and hang out around the sports facility			0
if these allegations are proven true , this scandal is far worse than anything that 's happened at other universities			1
exploiting dozens and raping young boys could never compare to the minor infractions of boosters buying a car for a player or a player selling his autographed football jersey for a few bucks			0
now , as i look back at my years at @entity2 and realize that some of these alleged incidents were possibly taking place as i was a student there proudly waving my pompoms , i feel sick			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			2

@entity176 is a proud @entity2 alum , former @entity14 cheerleader
@entity2 sports had *squeaky* - clean reputation ; @entity181 defended it through thick or thin
@entity181 : coach @entity31 must step down , it is inexcusable he did not tell authorities
if this is true , it is far worse than any infractions seen at other universities , she writes
