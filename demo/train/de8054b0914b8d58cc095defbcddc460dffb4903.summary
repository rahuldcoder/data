@entity0 , @entity1 -- the last time i 'd seen @entity0 , it was a mangled wreck			1
much of the city had been smashed			1
what was left was a landscape of rubble , rain and mud , stripped and torn - down trees , smashed vehicles and isolated concrete shells that had been homes			1
worst of all was the smell of death and decay as bodies were dragged from the ruins and left at the side of the road to be collected			2
the living were in a state of shocked bewilderment			0
it was a little more than a week after @entity26 had pummeled this @entity1 city			1
as i climbed onto a @entity30 military flight to @entity31 i could see thousands of people trying desperately to get out on one of the handful of aid flights -- a stark testimony to the devastation they were leaving behind			0
half a year on coming back , almost seven months later , i was prepared for the worst and half expecting to see a city still in shock , lacking the basics of food , water and housing			1
the scars of @entity26 are still vivid but the city is recovering			1
the main commercial district is very much open for business , the roads are cleared and busy and the power companies are restoring supply			0
the @entity53 and @entity54 plants are both back up and running and hotels are open doing a brisk trade , especially with workers from the many @entity58 involved in the recovery effort			0
but the evidence of one of the most intense storms in recorded history is everywhere -- in shattered steel structures that were once factories , as well as the many wrecked houses left by their owners to rot in the searing tropical heat			1
and always most haunting are the graveyards			0
from tiny unmarked mounds indicating the burial of a child , to bigger plots filled with extended families			0
on one wooden board , i counted 22 names from the same family			0
moving forward but even amid these scenes of such desperate sadness , there is an acceptance of what has happened and a willingness to move forward			0
we arrived at sundown at a mass grave in the grounds of @entity91 church in @entity92 , which is just outside @entity0			1
an empty piece of ground just meters from the graves had been taken over by children playing , the sound of laughter ringing across the night			0
it is the resilience of the people here that stands out			0
@entity0 was a moderately wealthy , mid-sized city before the storm -- though that does n't mean they 're insulated from nature			1
on average 20 powerful storms hit the region ever year			1
loss and destruction are part of the fabric of this region			0
but talk to the local people here now and it becomes clear that the rebuilding of @entity0 has reached a critical stage			1
the initial response to @entity26 as the international aid effort ramped up was a success -- no outbreak of disease , no widespread breakdown in law and order and enough supplies of emergency food and clean water			1
however , the rebuilding stage needs to be faster			1
after six months , less than 150 permanent new houses had been built			2
the master - plan calls for 200,000			2
while bureaucracy has been a major factor in the delays , the most important has been finding suitable land that fits in with the government 's " @entity139 " plan			2
new accommodation must be able to withstand @entity26 - like wind speeds , and be built on ground not vulnerable to storm surges and landslides			1
i asked @entity146 what he thought			0
i 'd met @entity146 at the hotel the @entity2 team had taken refuge in during @entity26			1
producer @entity153 , " storm - chaser " @entity151 and i had helped rescue @entity154 , his wife and their disabled daughter who had been trapped in their ground floor room by the rising storm surge			2
@entity154 was angry at the pace of the rebuilding but at the same time he was proud of what had been achieved in the recovery			2
" the national government should help the city more , " he said			2
" the money is here -- it 's just taking so long for the government to release it			2
why ? " his family is divided about whether they should stay			0
his daughter @entity174 , who has cerebal palsy , probably put it best though			0
" i do n't mind where we are , " she said			0
" as long as we are together			0
" in pictures : @entity0 after @entity26 and six months later			1

@entity26 hit the @entity1 in *november* , devastating towns such as @entity0
@entity2 's @entity183 returns to the city almost seven months on
landscape littered with wrecked cars , torn - down trees *slowly* *replaced* by signs of rebuilding
