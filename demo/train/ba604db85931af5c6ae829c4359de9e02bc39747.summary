-- @entity1 was the star witness thursday in his trial for the death of @entity4 -- for the prosecution , not in his defense			1
assistant state attorney @entity7 tried to use the defendant 's words against him , hoping to convince a jury that now has one more option than it once had : it can convict @entity1 of manslaughter , or the original second - degree murder charge , after a decision earlier thursday by judge @entity16			1
the third option is acquittal			0
no one else saw the february 26 , 2012 , altercation between @entity1 and @entity4			2
after that , the 17 - year - old could n't give his side			0
and , @entity23 argued thursday , @entity1 account that he was attacked and fired his gun because he feared for his life does n't hold up			2
" he brought a gun to a struggle , to a fight that he started ... wanting to make sure the victim did n't get away , " the prosecutor said			0
" and now he wants you to let him off because he killed the only eyewitness , the victim @entity4 , who was being followed by this man			0
" the now 29 - year - old @entity1 declined to testify wednesday , when his defense team rested its case , but his words were front - and - center thursday			1
@entity39 played in court excerpts of interviews @entity1 had given to police and in the media , then picked them apart			1
he said that they showed that the defendant ca n't be trusted , suggesting that his account from that evening in @entity48 , @entity49 , does n't mesh with reality			0
" ( @entity1 ) always has an excuse , or they catch him in a lie , " de la @entity7 said			1
how , the prosecutor said , does a neighborhood watch volunteer not know the names of that neighborhood 's three streets , getting out of his car to find an address ? why would a scared man get out of his car and walk around , after being told by a 911 dispatcher not to follow a man he thought was suspicious ? did @entity1 walk toward @entity4 , or did @entity4 come after him -- as he seemingly said both ? should he have had more than a bloody nose and scratches on his head after being pummeled ? on friday , it will be the defense 's turn , with lead attorney @entity70 spending up to three hours giving a closing argument			1
after that , the prosecution will have as long as one hour to give a rebuttal argument			0
and then , likely sometime friday , @entity1 's fate will be in the hands of the six jurors , all of them women			1
police urge calm as verdict nears in his final words thursday , @entity83 reminded them that , while @entity1 still has hope , there 's no more special moments for , there can be no more photos of @entity4			1
" and that 's true because of the actions of one person , " he said			0
" the man before me			0
the man who is guilty of second - degree murder			2
" judge : jury can consider manslaughter charge what happened to @entity4 -- and whether @entity1 was justified in shooting him -- has been debated intently for a year and a half			1
@entity1 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , talked with police but was n't arrested immediately after he admitted to the shooting			1
but in short time , community members and activists rallied against him -- claiming that @entity1 , who is @entity106 , had racially profiled the @entity109 - @entity108 teenager , tailed him over the objection of police dispatchers , then wrongly shot him down			1
the defense , in frequent media appearances by its lawyers and some by @entity1 and his immediately family members , said that it was wrong to characterize @entity1 as a racist			2
he acted to protect his own life , after being repeatedly punched and having his head slammed into the ground , they said			0
justice @entity123 ' peacekeepers ' worked ' @entity4 ' rallies , group claims on june 24 , the trial kicked off with opening statements			0
the prosecution called 38 witnesses in nine days , while the defense took parts of four days to call its witnesses			0
some of the testimony appeared contradictory			0
take , for instance , the panicked voice yelling for help as heard on the background of a 911 call from that night in @entity48 , @entity49			0
@entity1 's parents , @entity141 and @entity142 , both testified that they knew the person screaming was their son			1
contrast that to @entity4 's brother and mother , @entity147 , with the latter saying was " absolutely " certain the voice belonged to her child			0
for all the back - and - forth during the trial , the early part of thursday 's court proceedings was dominated by debate over what exactly the jury will be deciding			2
prosecutors asked that the six women be able to consider manslaughter and third - degree felony murder , in addition to the original second - degree murder charge , in their deliberations			2
defense attorney @entity163 reacted angrily to the third - degree felony murder charge , citing an element in it related to child abuse			0
" @entity170 , " he told judge @entity16 , calling the charge a " trick			0
" " just when i thought this case could n't get any more bizarre , the state is seeking third - degree murder based on child abuse			2
" @entity163 also argued against the manslaughter charge , telling @entity176 that @entity1 believes that because the " state has charged him with second - degree murder , they should be required to prove it , if they can			1
" in the end , the judge split the difference : the jury can consider manslaughter , but not third - degree felony murder			2
having both options is " enormous , " said @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity190 , especially given that @entity1 could serve decades in prison on a manslaughter conviction			1
" the jury can think to itself , well , ... we 're compromising , " @entity190 said			0
" if the jury convicts on manslaughter , that would be a win for the prosecution			2
" @entity199 police chief : @entity1 probe ' taken away from us ' prosecutor : ' innocent 17 - year - old kid was profiled as a criminal ' the debate over the charges set the stage for @entity83 to give his closing argument			1
referencing a widely heard call to police that @entity1 made to police that night , the prosecutor contended that the defendant was bent on going after @entity4 -- even if the 911 dispatcher told him otherwise , and even though he never asked the unarmed teen directly what he was doing -- after he spotted him walking through his neighborhood			1
" this innocent 17 - year - old kid was profiled as a criminal			0
he was one of those a * * holes who get away , " de la @entity7 told jurors			0
" he was one of those f * * * ing punks			0
" the profane language , @entity7 argued , offers insight into @entity1 's mind that winter night -- depicting someone who bore particular malice toward a person he had decided without justification was among the criminals who had plagued his neighborhood in the months leading up to the shooting			1
that 's important , because to find @entity1 guilty of second - degree murder , jurors will have to find that he acted with " ill will , hatred , spite , or an evil intent " in shooting @entity4 , according to @entity49 law			1
opinion : what about @entity4 's right to ' stand his ground ? ' @entity39 characterized @entity1 as a wannabe police officer who wrongly took the law into his own hands and pressed the fatal encounter with @entity4			1
the teenager was " just doing a normal everyday thing " -- going to a convenience store to get skittles and a drink , then walking back to his father 's fiancee 's home before he ended up dead shortly after 7 p.m. , the prosecutor said			2
" a teenager is dead through no fault of his own , dead because a man made assumptions and acted on them , " said @entity7			0
" unfortunately , because his assumptions are wrong , @entity262 no longer walks on the earth			0
" " he profiled him as a criminal			0
he assumed certain things , that @entity4 was up to no good			0
and that 's what led to his death , " de @entity7 said before going on to attack many defense arguments about what happened that rainy night : @entity272 : -- argued that @entity1 , who had taken criminal justice classes , fed police a story of escalating violence and exaggerated fear to meet the standards of @entity49 's " @entity280 " self - defense law			1
-- questioned @entity1 's account of @entity4 straddling him , pounding his head into the pavement and , at one point , covering his mouth and nose with his hands			1
why is none of the blood seen on @entity1 's face found on @entity4 's hands , he asked			1
and , if the attack was so violent , why was @entity1 's jacket in such good shape afterward ? -- asked how was @entity1 able to scream for help , as he has said he was , if his mouth was filling with blood and he was being smothered by @entity4			1
-- said the lack of @entity4 's @entity299 on @entity1 's pistol refutes defense arguments that @entity4 had grabbed the gun during the struggle			1
thursday 's closing argument also marked the return of the foam , life - sized dummy that famously appeared a day earlier , when @entity70 grappled with it inside the courtroom to show rapt jurors the competing versions of what happened the rainy night @entity4 was killed			2
this time it was de @entity83 's turn			0
characterizing @entity1 's account of how @entity4 had straddled him -- while allegedly punching him , slamming his head and covering his neck and mouth -- the prosecutor questioned how the late teenager could have seen , much less reach for , the gun that @entity1 said he 'd had in a holster inside his waistband			1
" the truth does not lie , " @entity325 said			0
" ... so how does he manage to get it out and get a perfect shot to the heart of a 17 - year - old man ? " in trial , it 's a jury of millions @entity335 's @entity334 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 and @entity339 and @entity0 's @entity340 and @entity341 contributed to this report .			2
