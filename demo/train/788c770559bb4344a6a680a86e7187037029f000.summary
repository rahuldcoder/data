@entity0 -- whether or not the @entity4 parliament decides to subject the proposed takeover of @entity4 - based @entity6 by @entity8 pharmaceutical giant @entity7 to a public interest test , it 's clear we have already seen much more political intervention than is typically involved in an acquisition of one company by another			1
the chief executives of both companies are being hauled in front of not one , but two parliamentary committees this week to give evidence about the possible implications of a deal , when an offer has n't even been accepted yet			2
@entity7 's pursuit of @entity6 has stirred up a wealth of protectionist feeling in @entity4 , despite the fact the company was originally created from a merger with @entity31 's @entity30 and has the bulk of its employees outside of the @entity4			1
the reaction to @entity7 's bid raises the question of what nationality really means for modern multinationals			1
over 50 % of shares on the @entity4 stock market are owned by investors from the rest of the world and many of the companies have employees and customers on several continents			0
they make their investment decisions based on a range of commercial and reputational factors , with nationalism way down the list			0
when companies choose to locate their operations in the @entity4 , they do so because it is an attractive place to do business			0
the @entity4 accounts for 10 % of world 's pharmaceutical research and development spending and @entity6 says it supports more than 33,000 jobs			1
companies have chosen to conduct their r&d here in part because of the strength of @entity4 's universities and a positive tax system , including the " patent box " which incentivizes businesses to invest in research			2
government has a significant role to play in promoting life sciences , and creating a stable tax and regulatory regime , but ultimately it will always be up to companies to make those investment decisions			1
many have argued that the government should be doing all it can to protect these r&d jobs , but that displays a degree of wishful thinking about the state 's ability to pick winners			2
@entity4 politicians have a poor record in this area , as shown notably with @entity90 in the 1970s and 80s			0
some have argued that , while not intervening in the running of companies , the government should require firmer commitments to retain research facilities and employees			0
the memory of the @entity100 takeover over @entity101 , which saw significant lay - offs soon after the takeover , is fresh in the memory			2
the shadow secretary of state for business , @entity106 , is right to argue that there are no assurances that a company could give that they would be able to preserve jobs forever after a takeover , but it does n't follow that we should demand ever more promises			0
the merged company , large as it would be , would still be subject to commercial pressures , and forced to adapt as necessary to an ever - changing world			0
the very impossibility of cast - iron guarantees should convince us that politician intervention is at best futile , and at worst risks undermining the @entity4 as a destination for investment			0
this may have been an unusually large reaction , but foreign companies looking at @entity4 may be entitled to think that being the subject of a parliamentary debate and receiving a grilling from two select committees are not the hallmarks of an economy which allows firms to conduct their lawful business as they think best			0
none of this , of course , is an argument in favor of the takeover			0
there may even be good reasons to think that the tax benefits for @entity7 give the whole thing a fishy smell			1
but the people to decide this are the board and the shareholders			0
this is n't about making a quick buck from the sale			0
under the @entity154 , the company 's directors are explicitly required to deliver success over the long - term			1
the board of @entity6 must consider a range of stakeholders , including employees and the scientific community			2
if it continues to feel that it has a stronger future as an independent company , as it did when it rejected the recent bid , then the board should continue to advise shareholders to ignore @entity7 's advances			1
ultimately , the decision is in the hands of shareholders			1
they must consider carefully whether even an increased offer should make them sell up -- after all , any deal would involve part payment in shares of the combined company , not something you want to hold if you think it 's a bad deal			1

@entity190 's @entity188 says the @entity7 bid for @entity6 has *prompted* significant political intervention
he said @entity7 's pursuit of @entity6 has stirred up a wealth of protectionism , even if it 's a global company
ultimately the decision is in the hands of the shareholders who must consider the deal carefully
