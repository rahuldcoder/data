" we check email pretty much everywhere these days , " @entity5 content manager @entity15 wrote on the @entity7 blog			1
" and when we do , we want easy access to our important messages so we can respond quickly and get back to life -- or slinging birds at thieving green pigs			0
" users of @entity3 's operating system could already access @entity7 through a mobile site or set it up as their default e-mail account			1
but the new app promised a smoother experience with a host of new features			0
the tech blogosphere was delighted			0
" go get the @entity8 app for @entity7 ! " popular blogger @entity33 wrote on his @entity35 page			1
then , a few minutes passed			0

the @entity7 app is really a piece of crud , " he wrote			1
" @entity5 had obviously already noticed what @entity33 did			2
shortly after it was unveiled , the app was pulled from the @entity44			2
" the @entity48 app we launched today contained a bug with notifications , " @entity5 posted on its @entity46 account			2
" we have pulled the app to fix the problem			0
" later , a fuller explanation was added to the original blog post			0
" earlier today we launched a new @entity7 app for @entity48 , " @entity5 posted			1
" unfortunately , it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app. we 've removed the app while we correct the problem , and we 're working to bring you a new version soon			1
everyone who 's already installed the app can continue to use it			0
