@entity0 , @entity1 -- two of the rev. @entity5 's children are suing their brother , accusing him of wrongfully taking money from their parents ' estates			1
@entity10 , left , @entity11 and @entity12 attend a 2006 tribute for their late mother			1
@entity11 and @entity12 allege that @entity10 took " substantial funds " out of @entity16 's estate and " wrongfully appropriated " money from their father 's estate			1
the suit , filed thursday in @entity23 , serves as a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity , particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings			1
in a written statement friday , @entity10 called the suit " inappropriate and false			1
" " i 'm disappointed that our personal family disagreement , as it relates to the family business , has evolved into being handled in a public legal forum , " he said			0
" it is my hope that this inappropriate and false claim by my siblings will be swiftly resolved and we can go about the business of focusing on our parents ' tremendous legacy			0
" the rev. @entity5 was assassinated in april 1968 in @entity42 , where he was to lead garbage workers on a protest march			0
@entity5 's wife , @entity16 , also devoted her life to the civil rights movement , died in 2006			2
attorneys for @entity11 and @entity12 would not say friday how much money they are accusing @entity10 of taking from their mother 's estate			1
@entity11 is the administrator of that estate			2
@entity10 , the suit says , controls their father 's estate , which is registered as a @entity1 corporation			1
all three children are shareholders in that corporation			0
the lawsuit names @entity10 and the corporation as defendants			2
it alleges that last month , the defendants " converted substantial funds from the estate 's financial account at @entity67 for their own use			1
" @entity70 , an @entity0 attorney representing the plaintiffs , said @entity10 is a signatory on the account , but " was not authorized to transfer the funds , " and gave his sister " no notice that those funds were being transferred			1
" the suit says that as a result of the transfer , " plaintiffs have and will suffer financial loss			2
" the lawsuit lists @entity11 as a plaintiff both individually and as administrator of their mother 's estate			1
separately , the suit says @entity10 " has wrongfully appropriated assets belonging to the [ estate of the rev. @entity5 ] or its shareholders for his own benefit			1
" @entity70 said @entity10 has refused to say what has happened with some of the corporation 's money			1
" i ca n't tell you that he 's gone out and used corporate assets for his own living expenses , " the attorney said			0
" what i can tell you for certainty is that by not providing @entity5 and @entity11 with information about how the corporation is using its assets , he is essentially using those assets , appropriating those assets for his own benefit			2
" the plaintiffs ' attorneys would not estimate the size of either estate			0
but one , @entity110 , noted that a collection of @entity5 's manuscripts and other items was sold in 2006 for a reported $ 32 million			0
" i do n't think it was a substantial corporation of any sort before that , " @entity110 said			0
over the years , the family of the civil rights leader has zealously protected its financial interests , at times taking legal steps even against the media for showing some of @entity5 's most famous speeches			0
in 2005 , some news agencies reported on the @entity126 , a nonprofit , having put millions of dollars into a for - profit business run by @entity10			2
the family rejected allegations of wrongdoing , and has generally pushed to keep financial matters private			0
@entity110 said his clients made repeated efforts to reach out to their brother in recent weeks before deciding to take legal action			0
@entity110 agreed with the suggestion that it was emotionally tough for the @entity5 children to file the suit			0
" that would be the understatement of the year , @entity110 said .			0
