-- for the last 10 years , people have blithely commented , " @entity2 is really changing our world			2
" the use of mobile and wireless technologies has thrust people into a permanent technology age with the kind of warp speed that author @entity10 predicted in his groundbreaking book " @entity12 " some 40 years ago			1
as a result , we now live in a time of profound social upheaval equivalent to the @entity17			1
it seems we have little choice but to embrace our techno - driven reality			0
while countless individuals and corporations race to create bigger - better - smaller - faster hardware and software , the rest of the world struggles to keep up			0
this struggle takes many forms : learning new gadgets and systems ; successfully integrating into the workplace different competencies with digital technology ; and somehow being able financially to keep up			0
it also includes asking , " how , exactly , is mobile changing our world , and is it all for good ? how can we incorporate more and more technology without losing our humanity ? " many people understand the need for addressing the " human cost " of digital device mobility			1
recently , the @entity43 dedicated two pages of its @entity46 section to an article entitled , " the @entity48 of @entity49			0
" the article addressed whether or not the increase in childhood injuries could be directly attributed to mobile device distraction of supervising adults			2
fortunately , international thought leaders and scholars have begun to examine mobile and wireless for their effects on a wide variety of areas in our lives			1
i have coined a single word -- @entity66 [ mobile + ology ] -- to describe and give context to the study of mobile and wireless usage specifically as it relates to human behavior ; community ( formation , building and abandonment ) ; culture ; economics ; education ; entertainment ; healthcare ; and international relations			1
since 2009 , i have lectured around the world advocating for the creation of mobilology as a new and formal social science at university level			1
since mobile affects nearly every established academic discipline , acknowledging its importance , independently , as a pivotal change agent in a rapidly evolving world makes good sense educationally , can cost very little to implement , and will prove invaluable			1
by establishing mobilology as a bonafide field of study , universities can remain at the cutting edge of education by offering course work with clear relevancy to incoming and interested students			1
the first university to do so will get permanent bragging rights			0
furthermore , it will foster the development of future scholars and leaders in an ever - expanding field that heretofore has simply lacked a unifying name			0
students will learn about the effects of mobile and wireless use as it relates to human behavior in their psychology classes			1
they will gain insight to the effects of mobile on community building ( e.g. through mobile gaming ) , community sustenance ( @entity116 continues to grow at an unprecedented pace ) , and community abandonment ( remember @entity124 ? ) through their sociology courses			1
similarly , they will learn about the effects of mobile as it relates to culture , economics , education , entertainment , healthcare ( which itself is a dynamic growth industry as a direct result of what can be achieved through mobile and wireless devices ) , and international relations			1
many developing nations are far more innovative and advanced than the @entity141 in their uses of mobile			2
if we are to remain competitive internationally , we must take the lead educationally			0
the creation of a distinct mobilology discipline will benefit everyone by identifying those academics and students doing cutting - edge and thought - provoking research that can be applied to almost any industry			2
it will allow mobile - and wireless - based enterprise to connect with top minds to share existing information , with the possibility of funding future research that would otherwise not be sustainable			2
as for the argument that some companies have in - house r&d and this would cut out independent research companies , i say " no. " @entity169 companies will always need commissioned research			0
this will increase the pool of experts available to glean the truest , most current information for a client			0
right now , hundreds of academics are involved in research either directly or tangentially related to mobilology			0
but finding these people is not easy			0
they identify primarily with the schools or departments in which they normally work			0
one reason may be that within today 's university system , no matrix exists to provide the cohesion necessary for examining a growing cache of independent and / or university - acquired metadata that can reveal profound global trends and potential pitfalls			0
without a formalized matrix to provide global context to their work , and encourage connectivity with other like - minded academics , we will continue to have a disarticulated population of individual experts in the effects of mobile and wireless use			1
today we have the means to connect these individuals to each other , as well as to the global mobile industry , for cross-pollination of ideas , funding , research , manufacturing , and responsible forward growth that advances by incorporating the fascinating and sometimes unexpected effects of mobilology .			2

@entity217 is advocating for the creation of " @entity66 " as a new social science
@entity66 aims to study how mobile devices are changing our society , and whether it is all for good
social changes created by mobile tech are " equivalent to the @entity17 "
students would learn about the effects of mobile and wireless use on human behavior
