-- @entity2 's imdb page experienced a sudden assault of truth grenades earlier today , resulting in an @entity6 bio that looked just a little bit ... different			1
" @entity2 is emblematic of the shallowness of @entity11 culture in the first two decades of the new millennium , " read her official biography			1
" while some cultural critics call her the prime avatar of the ' famous for being famous ' faux celebrity crowd , she along with @entity13 is a new breed of cat whose celebrity comes from the release of a sex tape and the canny exploitation of the resulting publicity			0
" too many truth grenades ! my nose is bleeding ! the @entity6 bio continued : " for @entity13 and @entity2 , the release ( accidental or not - so - accidental ) of boudoir tapes did n't result in shame but celebration			2
@entity11 , like ancient @entity32 , seems to have shuffled off the moral coil of virtue of the @entity35 and is now enjoying its @entity37 self in an orgy of ignominy			2
" the bio then noted various superstars who have derided @entity2 for her faux fame , including @entity43 and @entity44 , before concluding with a walloping pulpit - imploding rant , noting that @entity2 's fame was kick - started by a sex tape , " an apt metaphor for socio - economic - cultural malaise in @entity51 and the country beyond , where everything seems to be run by amoral prostitutes in bed with each other and merely out for a buck			1
" the bio has disappeared from @entity6 , but @entity59 has a screenshot , where it 's credited to @entity62 , a writer who has crafted over six hundred @entity6 biographies			1
it 's unclear if the bio was actually written by @entity62			0
but the rant does read like the typical aggressive pseudo-philosophical @entity32 - referencing post that overworked frustrated - narcissist bloggers tend to write about @entity2			0
