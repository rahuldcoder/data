-- @entity2 veteran @entity1 won his second stage of the @entity4 on wednesday as cycling 's premier event returned to less testing terrain after two days of crash - marred racing			1

@entity16 retained the leader 's yellow jersey as he came home 26th in the 163 - strong peloton in the same time as last year 's winner @entity21 ( 32nd ) and seven - time champion @entity21 ( 36th )			1
@entity23 rider @entity15 , who won six stages last year , had a better day after struggling in the wet and on the cobble stones of previous runs but will be disappointed after being forced out of contention at the final sprint			1
@entity1 timed his dash to perfection as he followed up his win in the first stage into the @entity34 capital of @entity35 , where several crashes dented the hopes of @entity15 among others			1
the @entity40 team rider came home in three hours 34 minute and 55 seconds to edge out new zealander @entity42 and @entity44 's @entity43 , with @entity46 @entity45 fourth and @entity48 's @entity47 fifth			2
@entity49 's @entity16 retained a 23 - second lead over @entity52 's @entity51 , who was 19th , while third - placed @entity46 @entity53 remained a further 16 seconds back after ending in 16th			1
@entity13 retained the sprinters ' green points jersey that he won overall last year and in 2005 , but had his margin trimmed to 10 points by @entity1 and acknowledged the threat posed by the 36 - year - old -- back at the tour for the first time since 2004			1
" i do n't know what happened at the finish today , i just had nothing in the legs when i started to sprint			2
i just felt tired and i could n't go in the last couple of hundred meters , " @entity13 told the @entity67 website			0
" yesterday and the day before i went really deep and i think i 'm paying for it now			0
i still have a lead in the green jersey competition but you saw today that i lost a lot of points to @entity1 and @entity45			2
it was a fast and nervous sprint today and in the last corner i was too far back			0
" i think i spent too much energy to fight with @entity15 and , when @entity1 went on the left , i just could n't sprint			1
@entity1 is a threat to the green jersey			2
he seems really strong now and , if he wants to , he come make it all the way to @entity83			0
" i 'm surprised by how well @entity1 is going			0
i know he 's a good , strong rider but to come back to the @entity67 like he has is impressive			2
" @entity84 rider @entity16 was happy to have an uneventful day after losing teammate @entity85 on tuesday			0
" my team was happy and i think many other teams were pleased			0
we needed something like this after tough , hard , nervous , and stressful opening stages , " he said			0
" we 've spent a lot of energy and we need to recover a bit because soon we 'll get to the @entity95 , and that 's when another sort of music will play			0
