on wednesday night , @entity0 opened " @entity10 " with a big reveal : a first look at the cover of this year 's @entity5 swimsuit issue , featuring model @entity6 , and quite a lot of her at that			1
the ultra-revealing cover shows @entity12 pulling down her already - minuscule bikini bottoms to within a millimeter of an area typically reserved for intimate partners and gynecologists			2
she 's been waxed , it is evident , to bald perfection			0
one wrong breath , and she 'd expose actual labia ( how 's that for newsstand - appropriate ? ) of course , @entity5 's annual swimsuit spectacular has never been without controversy			1
it 's almost intended for controversy			0
last year 's cover featured three topless models , although they faced away from the camera			2
supermodel @entity29 's 2012 cover featured her in similarly barely there bikini bottoms			0
putting aside the fact that a woman is more likely to end up on the cover of @entity5 for her ability to look amazing in a bikini than for her accomplishments as an athlete -- and indeed few press mentions of @entity12 ' cover have noted that she is a former tennis champion , while few have omitted the fact that she is @entity44 's girlfriend -- it 's possible to consider the notion that the issue 's purpose is to celebrate the female form , with a side of swimwear			1
i 'm not opposed to celebrating beauty , especially when a woman works hard to achieve and maintain it			0
the idea of " if you have it , use it " is ok by me , even if the beauty the swimsuit issue tends to show off is a very specific sort of beauty			0
( indeed , perhaps the biggest disappointment is that @entity12 ' headline - generating cover overshadows what truly is a positive step for female empowerment : the issue 's first - ever inclusion of a plus - size model , @entity69 , and in a bikini of her own design , no less			1
but you 're hearing far less about that			0
) this year , though , @entity5 has gone too far			2
in the photo , @entity12 eager pulls down her bikini bottom and thrusts forward her pelvis in a way that 's clearly meant to draw the eye to that very spot between her legs -- far more so than her eyes , or even her breasts			0
it 's an invitation to picture her naked , and more			0
and in case there was any ambiguity of what the image is supposed to evoke , there 's the clever cover line that begins : " @entity6 goes @entity94			0
... " it is explicitly explicit , and as such impossible not to view it as intending to reduce women to billboards and sex objects			1
claiming to portray @entity12 this way in the name of " celebrating the female form " is a lie balder than her nether region			1
plus - size models give @entity5 's swimsuit edition more curves after all , if the point is n't to objectify women for the pleasure of the male gaze , why has no one created a counterpart magazine featuring a scantily dressed man ? why are men so rarely offered up as objects to behold ? men are n't the only ones who like to " appreciate the beauty " of the opposite sex			1
if the point is n't to objectify women , and subvert them in some way , then why is n't there a similar model for men ? instead , most examples of men gracing magazine covers with their bodies on display are for men 's magazines , with a male readership			2
why is it normal to " celebrate the female form " but not the male one ? maybe that 's next			1
but it 's highly doubtful			0
the only thing remaining that could be more shocking than this year 's cover image would be if the magazine decided next year to run a cover of a supermodel in a ( gasp ! ) one - piece swimsuit			1

@entity146 : @entity5 swimsuit edition cover baldly about reducing women to sex objects
@entity146 asks why is there no *heralded* magazine cover showing a man
why is it only normal to " celebrate the female form " ? she asks
