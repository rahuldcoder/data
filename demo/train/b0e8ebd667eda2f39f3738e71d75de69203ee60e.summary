forget the tuba and accordion			0
put away the lederhosen , and keep the beer steins on the shelf			1
the vast majority of today 's beer festivals have little in common with the traditional @entity8 celebration			1
as craft beer continues to rise in popularity , the trickle - down effect of that growth means more beer festivals popping up all over the @entity14			1
and the beer festivals of today offer a lot more than just drinking ales and lagers			1
many offer live entertainment , educational workshops and even food pairings			0
below are seven upcoming beer festivals that are setting the standard by which to measure all others			1
@entity26 savor stands out from the pack with its thoughtful pairing of great food with exceptional ( and often rare ) beer			1
the festival takes place in @entity34 this year , and apart from the chance to try great beer and food combinations , it gives attendees an opportunity to hang out and chat with the " rock stars " of the beer world			1
chef @entity42 leads a team of culinary professionals who create the food pairings based on the flavor profiles of each beer being served			2
but perhaps the coolest thing about this event are the tasting salons , intimate educational ( and drinking ! ) sessions where brewers speak on topics like " blending a barrel - aged sour beer " and " a taste of @entity58 from the @entity59			2
" the event takes place june 14 and 15 , and tickets are on sale now			0
8 best beer towns in the @entity14 @entity65 the @entity66 is put on by the folks behind @entity69 magazine			1
it 's considered one of the best beer festivals in the country , and beer lovers flock from all over the world to attend this two - day festival in @entity75			1
the festival serves more than 600 beers from 135 breweries and includes several beers that are brewed exclusively for the event : once the beer is gone , so is the chance to ever have it again			2
it takes place on may 31 and june 1 , and tickets are available online			0
@entity85 , @entity86 when people ask me " what 's your favorite brewery ? " my answer is inevitably either " the one i 'm drinking right now " or " @entity95			0
" the @entity86 brewery has won several medals at beer competitions and has raked in numerous " brewery of the year " awards			2
but instead of resting on its laurels , it continues to champion craft beer with the @entity105			1
the festival is described as " a day where we can all put down our sales and marketing pitches and simply commune and share our beers and stories with people who are truly interested in craft beer			1
" the festival takes place june 1			0
sadly for many , tickets sold out in a matter of hours			0
mark your calendars for next year , beer lovers			2
@entity123 @entity122 , @entity123 the 26th annual @entity124 is one of the longest - running and largest beer festivals in the country			1
it takes place in @entity130 over five days in july and draws more than 80,000 beer drinkers every year			1
the festival also includes live music , home brewing demonstrations and beer - related vendors			1
the all - ages festival is free to attend and even includes the @entity137 , so the kiddos can get their drink on , too			0
for those consuming beer , this is a " pay as you drink " festival , and beer pours range from $ 1 to $ 4			2
i like this option because i rarely drink enough beer at a festival to justify the price of admission ( that can hit upwards of $ 75 )			2
burning @entity153 , @entity152 for all the canned beer lovers out there , there 's the @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity152			1
this can - only beer fest is put on by the pioneers of the craft beer can movement , @entity162			1
the festival features more than 30 breweries , a @entity166 dirt bike competition and live music			2
oh , and it 's all set against the backdrop of @entity170			0
go for the scenery and stay for the beer and entertainment			2
tickets for the june 1 @entity157 fest are available online			0
paste @entity177 paste magazine has taken its love for indie music and craft beer and turned it into a series of festivals taking place throughout the country			1
other beer festivals have live music , but let 's be honest , it 's usually local bands that provide background noise			1
@entity193 brings musicians and bands that are worth the price of admission alone			0
add an awesome selection of craft suds , and it 's easy to see why this is one of the most talked - about festivals of 2013			1
according to @entity202 , the next @entity193 is set for @entity203 in september			0
road trip , anyone ? @entity206 and @entity207 are slated to follow in october and november			0
the @entity130 , @entity208 no fancy or clever name is needed for this @entity130 , @entity208 , beer fest that 's simply called @entity211			1
most of the aforementioned beer festivals highlight @entity14 craft beer , and this one slightly deviates from the norm and offers mostly international beers			1
presented by @entity218 and 12 percent imports , this two - day beer festival includes limited releases like @entity221 , an extremely rare beer out of @entity223			2
the @entity66 takes place on june 21 and 22 , and tickets are still available for purchase online			0
lastly , here 's some tips to make sure you get the most out of your beer festival experience : eat before ( and during ) the festival			2
drinking on an empty stomach is never a good idea			0
drink plenty of water to stay hydrated			0
a good rule of thumb is an ounce of water per ounce of beer			0
have a game plan before you attend			0
or else you risk spending too much time wandering around looking for the @entity245 booth			0
try beers you 've never had / can not easily get			0
and make sure to hit those booths first before the beer runs out			0
many festivals offer free or discounted admission for designated drivers , and car services like @entity254 will sometimes offer discounts to festival attendees			0
