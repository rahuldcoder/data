-- former world no. 1 @entity1 has fired @entity3 coach @entity2 after just two months and decided to return to working with her father @entity4			1
the @entity5 slipped to fourth in the @entity7 rankings after a quarterfinal exit at the recent @entity9 , where she once again failed to secure a first grand slam title			2
@entity12 , a journalist with the @entity14 newspaper @entity13 , told @entity0 how @entity2 had struggled to penetrate the close bond @entity1 enjoys with her @entity17 - born father			1
" @entity1 and @entity4 are mentally very tight , " @entity12 said			1
" it 's very hard to break into the circle			0
he is not the first one has experienced that			0
" it was more @entity4 's idea than @entity1 's and i do n't think she ever got used to him			1
they had agreed that they should sit down after the @entity9 and discuss the situation			2
" @entity12 said the tactical advice @entity2 gave @entity1 during last month 's @entity30 grand slam appeared to be ignored by the 21 - year - old			1
" he must have seen that his input did not come out on the court			0
when the @entity14 press confronted @entity1 with his analysis , she would not comment , " @entity12 said			1
" i sensed when i got to @entity30 that something was wrong because the @entity1 team are usually in good spirits , but they were not this time			0
" despite the split with @entity2 , @entity12 stressed that there was still a high level of respect between the three			2
" they like him very much and they 're good friends			0
in my opinion they should have been more clear about who should do what and who is entitled to do what before they started working together			0
" @entity1 's failure to capture a grand slam title during her spell at the top of the world rankings meant she faced constant questioning on the subject			2
@entity12 said @entity1 is also now facing criticism from a vocal minority of @entity14 tennis fans who find it hard to identify with her lifestyle			1
" there is a part of the @entity14 population who are irritated by her and think that she is not very @entity14 , she 's very @entity72 in her ways because of her father , " he said			2
" they say , ' she is living in @entity75 , not paying her taxes blah blah blah ... ' but i think it 's a minority , but they are very loud			0
if you see the forums and newspapers ' websites , people are a little bit skeptical about her chances of winning a grand slam			0
" @entity1 will look to return to winning ways at this month 's @entity7 tournament in @entity92 , where last year she lost in the final			0
this year 's entry list includes new no. 1 and @entity9 champion @entity96 .			1
