-- while tragedy envelops the families of the injured and dead in @entity7 's @entity6 train derailment , the train 's operator could be facing a crisis of his own from criminal charges , if compelling evidence supports them			1
although such charges are difficult to prove in accident cases , this one may prove to be an exception to the rule			2
it is the kind of high - profile case involving multiple deaths and many injuries that will undoubtedly attract the careful scrutiny of the prosecutor in charge : @entity25 district attorney @entity24			0
even at this early stage of the investigation , it would appear that a determined prosecutor could find adequate evidence to support an indictment			2
@entity7 's gov. @entity32 , a former prosecutor himself , made it clear he believes law enforcement will look into the engineer 's actions , and that the derailment was related to " excessive speed and reckless handling of the train			1
" he focused on the investigators ' assessment that the train was traveling at least 82 mph through a sharp " deadman 's curve , " which requires a speed of 30 mph for the safety of the train and its passengers			0
" i would n't be surprised if criminal agencies looked into the facts of the matter once they 're fully developed , " @entity32 said			2
should these facts prove to be accurate , the framework of a criminally negligent homicide prosecution begins to emerge from the twisted rubble on the @entity55			1
under @entity7 law , criminally negligent homicide can be charged in cases where death is caused by acts of grossly negligent or reckless conduct			1
@entity7 characterizes these charges as criminally negligent homicide , manslaughter or " depraved indifference murder , " depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the case			1
the penalty for these crimes increases exponentially as the degree of negligence escalates to killing with " depraved indifference " to human life			0
the depraved indifference murder charge carries essentially the same penalty as a deliberate and intentional murder , usually known as " @entity78 " in other states			0
unlike civil cases , in which the only penalty is the award of money damages , criminal liability for a homicide based on gross negligence , recklessness or " depraved indifference , " can result in substantial prison sentences , ranging from a year - and - a - half to life			2
for this reason , the standard or proof required to prove such charges is quite rigorous			0
certainly operating a commuter train at such an excessive speed would easily constitute either reckless or grossly negligent conduct			1
historically , @entity7 courts have required more than a single act of negligent conduct before upholding a very serious charge like criminally negligent homicide			1
in most cases in which the charge of criminal negligence or recklessness is upheld by appellate courts , a defendant must exhibit at least two forms of negligent conduct in the commission of the crime			1
for example , in drunken driving prosecutions for criminally negligent homicide , cases are often based on the claim that the defendant was not only drunk but was also speeding or ignoring other traffic laws when the person was killed			1
( in mr. @entity123 's case , blood tests for alcohol were negative			2
) but it 's possible that the prosecution could meet this high standard if investigators find evidence that mr. @entity123 was not only speeding at 82 mph when entering the dangerous curve , but was also operating a train while inattentive or impaired			1
that is similar to running a red light or a stop sign because of inattention -- the law does not grant a waiver for the failure to perceive an obvious risk			0
his own lawyer 's surprising admission that mr. @entity123 was driving a train while dazed or " zoned out " could constitute yet another form of gross negligence -- at the first sign of such a condition , prosecutors will argue , a reasonable person exercising due care for the safety of his passengers would have stopped the train and radioed for assistance			1
even if the engineer avoids a criminal indictment , he will most certainly be involved as a witness or a party in many civil lawsuits filed by the victims and their families			2
both he and @entity6 officials will have to fight claims of negligence in the training and monitoring of railroad personnel			0
they will also have explain to the families of those whose loved ones perished on a routine commute to @entity7 why this happened when technology has long existed to stop an out of control locomotive from speeding into a dangerous curve			0
@entity123 's real worries , however , should be focused on possible criminal charges			1
in november of 1992 , 39 - year - old @entity179 motorman , @entity177 , was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison for the reckless manslaughter of five subway passengers in a derailment caused by speeding			0
he was drunk , however , and had walked away from the accident			0
a robbery suspect who ran over a nun while fleeing police in a minivan was convicted of murder in yet another example of reckless homicide while operating a vehicle in @entity7			0
the @entity194 's findings are not yet in			0
but if the investigation finds the accident was not related to track conditions or a terrible mechanical problem , but was because of human error , the defense will have to prove the existence of something that struck him suddenly and unexpectedly -- or mr. @entity123 could soon be traveling " up the river " in handcuffs toward a new residence			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity209 : train operator could face charges if evidence supports criminal negligence
@entity209 : criminally negligent homicide very difficult to prove , but possible in this case
@entity209 : grounds seem adequate to seek an indictment against train engineer @entity123
gov. @entity32 says tragedy related to " excessive speed and reckless handling of the train "
