-- it was inevitable that the fiery politics of the death penalty would punctuate saturday 's remembrance of @entity5			1
his 20 years of claims of innocence on @entity10 's death row earned him millions of supporters who believe the state wrongfully executed him on the night of september 21			1
saturday , @entity5 ' family and closest friends gathered inside the @entity16 to celebrate his life			1
a mass of flowers covered @entity5 ' closed casket			1
two photos flanked it -- one a color portrait of a young boy who grew up on the streets of @entity28 's @entity27 neighborhood and the other a black and white photo of a young man in a suit attending his murder trial			2
those in attendance repeatedly chanted : " i am @entity5 , " the slogan adopted in the campaign to spare his life and one that went viral on social media networks			1
" look at those last two lines of your program today , " said @entity42 , president of the @entity43			2
" jealous and other friends and advocates for @entity5 , including his lawyer , @entity49 , voiced @entity5 ' last words before he was put to death by lethal injection			1
that he was sorry for the family of police officer @entity54 , but that he was innocent			2
" we 're going to keep on fighting until his name is finally cleared and @entity10 admits what it has done , " @entity42 said			2
" we 're going to keep on fighting until the death penalty is abolished and this can never be done to anyone else			1
" @entity54 was shot in the early morning hours of august 19 , 1989 , in the parking lot of a @entity64 just a few miles north of the church where @entity5 was memorialized			1
@entity5 was tried and convicted for @entity54 's murder and sent to death row in 1991			1
but he and his family had always maintained that the jury convicted the wrong man			2
the @entity71 said they lived in agony as legal proceedings dragged on year after year			2
the case became controversial after several of the witnesses who testified against him at trial later said they were coerced to speak against @entity5			1
it was battled in many courtrooms before his execution			2
but in the end , @entity5 lost all his appeals			1
" we are gathered here in a place of the most unjust execution of mankind , " @entity49 said			2
" @entity90 was killed on the cross , not because he was guilty , but because we are			2
" many have spoken of @entity93 as a symbol , " @entity49 said			0
" he was the soul of something profound			1
" @entity49 , a young antitrust lawyer signed onto defending @entity5 shortly after graduating from @entity98 's law school in @entity99			1
" i met him seven years ago			0
when i met him i was young			0
i was green , " he said			0
" from the very first conversation i had with @entity93 i knew he could be my older brother , my friend , and eventually , he became just that			0
" @entity103 , pastor at @entity104 in @entity99 , invoked the 1994 book that made @entity28 famous			0
" it 's midnight in the garden of good and evil , " he said			0
" but i am so glad @entity109 does his best work at midnight			0
when the adversary has our backs against the wall , that 's when @entity109 does his best work			0
" strange things happen in @entity28 , @entity10 , " he said			0
" this city of cobblestone streets and verdant town squares ... you have become the ground zero for the struggle to abolish the death penalty once and for all			1
@entity28 , @entity10 , the world is watching you			0
" @entity5 ' mother , @entity127 , died in april			1
she was not around to see the execution of her son , an act that would have surely been wretchedly painful to bear			0
@entity5 ' sisters , @entity132 and @entity133 , attended the funeral saturday , as did @entity136 's son @entity135			1
@entity136 , born prematurely , said his uncle @entity93 was afraid to hold him when he was first born			0
he weighed only 3 pounds , 8 ounces			0
" he thought he would break me , " @entity136 said			0
but he grew into a strong young man , he said , through his uncle 's guidance			2
he spoke of how @entity5 , from death row , used to help his nephew with homework , even put his tests and exams on his calendar			1
people tell him now that he 's a little version of his uncle			0
and that makes @entity136 , the nephew of an executed man , very proud			2
for all his life , his uncle lived 300 miles away , behind brick walls			0
but , he said , " it was always like he was home with us			0
" the funeral was open to the public , but @entity5 was to be buried saturday with only his family at his graveside			1
and then , just before people began streaming out of the church well into saturday afternoon , a message recorded by @entity5 thanked his supporters all over the world for their efforts on his behalf			1
" everything we do today will clear the way for a better tomorrow , " @entity5 said			1
" we can correct all the wrongs if we band together			0
do n't give up the fight			0
" the voice of the dead had filled the sanctuary .			0

" i am @entity5 , " chant those at the funeral
@entity5 is called an innocent man put to death
many speak out against the death penalty
he was the " soul of something profound , " says his lawyer
