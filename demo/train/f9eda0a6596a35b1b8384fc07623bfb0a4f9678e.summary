-- the resilience of a burned baby golden eagle that survived a @entity4 wildfire is astounding wildlife rehabilitators nursing him back to health			1
" the trauma and the injury and the situation he is in -- to come out of it is amazing , " said @entity8 , executive director of the @entity9 in @entity10			0
all of the eaglet 's feathers , even on his head , were charred			1
he also suffered burns to the feet and around his beak			0
his improbable story began june 1 , when a volunteer who documents eagles placed a band on the bird			0
the @entity28 erupted three weeks later , burning more than 5,500 acres south of @entity29 and west of @entity31			0
@entity32 returned in late june to the nest , built on the edge of the cliff , thinking he would recover the band from a deceased animal			1
the nest on @entity39 was gone , the rocks behind it blackened by the blaze			1
@entity32 then spotted legs and talons near a scorched juniper below			0
amazingly , the baby eagle was alive			1
near him were rabbit and squirrel carcasses , evidence his parents had tried to feed him after disaster struck			0
fortunately , his eyes had not been burned			1
wildfire victims face second tragedy @entity32 said he has thought of the horror the helpless nestling might have felt when flames approached			1
" he had enough courage to jump from that nest and try to save himself anyway , " said @entity32 , 56 , who describes himself as an amateur ornithologist			1
" he is a real fighter			0
" the fall was about 25 feet , and the eagle probably walked back to the base of the cliff after rolling another 100 feet , said @entity32			2
the bird remained in the area for several days while @entity32 , who is authorized to band raptors , sought permission from federal and state authorities to obtain care for him			2
on wednesday , @entity32 handed the bird over to @entity8			0
she and her staff dubbed the survivor " @entity79 " -- a reference to the mythical creature that is reborn from the ashes			1
there was no food in the craw of the dehydrated eagle , which weighed just over 5 pounds			2
" he was lethargic and just obviously hurting , " @entity8 told @entity0 on saturday			0
" after we got him hydrated and medications , he perked up and that fire came back in him			2
" @entity8 said @entity79 , now about 70 days old , was a handful saturday , lunging and using his talons as caregivers fed and provided antibiotics to the animal			1
" he 's not grateful , " she quipped			2
rehabilitators limit their contact with the eagle so that he will not " habituate , " or become too comfortable around people			2
they use hydrotherapy to help the healing in his feet			0
" he needs those for hunting			0
there are lots of tendons and muscles we need to protect , " said @entity8			0

@entity8 called @entity32 " the hero in this story			2
" it 's too early to tell whether @entity79 will be able to fly in the wild			1
rehabilitation will take at least a year and his feathers wo n't fully molt until mid- 2013			0
" we are fairly confident , but there could be follicle damage we do not know about that would prevent feathers from coming in , " @entity8 said			0
the nonprofit center , which treats about 1,800 animals a year , is accepting financial and food donations to offset the cost of caring for the golden eagle			1
" he is doing well and we are very positive about his outcome right now , " said @entity8			0
" ( but ) these types of things can turn at any moment			0
" how to donate in her 12 years of wildlife rehabilitation , @entity8 said , the eagle 's story is among a few cases she considers " nothing short of a miracle			1
