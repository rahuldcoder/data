-- it is a surprising scene -- a picnic - like atmosphere with children playing in the pool under the tropical sun. the adults are also in celebration mode			2
the crowd is listening to a couple of rappers and some people dance to the beat			0
but this is not a park or a recreational facility			0
it 's not somebody 's backyard either			0
this is pavilion 1234 at one of the largest correctional facilities in @entity22 : @entity23			1
the prison is located on @entity22 's @entity25 , also home to a popular beach resort that attracts international tourists			1
@entity29 , a @entity22 human rights advocate , says @entity23 , located in @entity32 state , has become a recreational facility where you can find anything from weapons to drugs and alcohol			1
inmates allegedly even have access to cockfighting rings and prostitutes , but that 's not the most shocking part			2
@entity29 , who 's also the general coordinator of a window to @entity46 , a prison watchdog group , says the inmates recently had a grand opening for a discotheque with capacity for 600 people			1
he learned about the night club after getting an invitation by email and confirming the news with prisoners			1
" this invitation talked about a discotheque with stage lights and led screens			0
it also talked about a party lasting until sunrise where there would be ' bad girls , ' with ' toys ' to play with them			0
you can then assume that they also had drugs , alcohol , and other things , " @entity29 said			0
this is not the first time conditions at the @entity23 prison have raised eyebrows			1
a @entity79 report in 2011 called the prison " a @entity82 - inspired fleshpot			1
" @entity29 , who has been at @entity23 several times , says the prison is actually run by @entity85 , a convicted drug trafficker known as " @entity86 " or " @entity87			1
" nothing happens at @entity23 without the approval of the rabbit or his gang , he says			1
" the state has n't been able to do anything against them in spite of the multiple statements made by the minister of prisons vowing to end the power of the mafias , " @entity29 said			0
@entity0 tried for weeks to get a response to the allegations from the @entity103			0
in a phone call , ministry spokesman @entity104 dismissed the discotheque claim			2
" that 's a lie			0
someone came up with that lie because they were trafficking drugs inside the prison and we ruined their business			1
we do not respond to lies , " @entity104 said , before abruptly ending the call			0
the possible existence of a discotheque inside a @entity22 prison is just the latest example of a prison system that human rights groups including a window to @entity46 , the @entity125 and @entity126 say is in a state of crisis			1
they say in the best cases , prisoners control their own affairs to preserve a fragile peace , while the worst involve constant riots and a climate of violence and murder			2
read more : report -- prison riot kills dozens in @entity22 according to the @entity125 , a prisoner rights organization , there are 45,500 inmates in 33 @entity22 prisons that were built for 17,500			1
this means the overcrowding rate in the country 's prison system is 176 %			0
@entity147 , an attorney with the group , says the observatory estimates that about 5,300 inmates have died inside prison walls since 1999 and more than 15,000 have been injured			2
many of the fatalities and injuries have been the result of prison uprisings			0
in january , 56 prisoners and one member of the @entity159 were killed during riots at @entity161 in @entity162 , according to a report by @entity126			0
forty - six other prisoners suffered serious injuries			2
during a weekend riot in june 2011 , 19 people died at @entity168 near @entity169 , the @entity22 capital , as reported by the @entity22 @entity170			2
" this government has been an accomplice by omission			0
we have a population of more than 20,000 inmates who have been the victims of violence in jails			2
some have lost their lives others have been injured			0
the state does not have the ability and has not demonstrated in practice that it can protect the life of prisoners , " @entity182 said			0
read more : @entity22 prison standoff comes to an end [ 2011 ] last december , minister @entity190 issued a statement after launching an investigation into the savage beating of inmates at a federal prison in @entity196			1
the investigation was launched after a video showed prisoners forced to strip completely naked and hit in the buttocks , one by one , with what appeared to be a baseball bat			0
" we strongly repudiate those actions against the inmates			0
if there 's a government that has respected the human rights of prisoners , that is the revolutionary government led by [ then ] president @entity211 , " the statement said			1
but @entity29 , the prisoner rights activist , says the government has done little to improve the situation and suggests the minister knows what happens inside prisons like @entity23 , on @entity25			1
he showed @entity0 a picture of @entity190 posing with @entity87 to make a point : gangsters have plenty of clout			0
what makes @entity23 different is a lower homicide rate			2
in other facilities , where overcrowding can be at dangerous levels , violence is common			2
last year alone , nearly 600 people died inside @entity22 prisons , according to @entity126			1
but at @entity23 , hard - core criminals seem to be content for the most part			1
their perks include free access to entertainment and women and a pool awaits those ready for a splash under @entity22 's tropical sun. additional reporting by @entity240 in @entity169			1

a human rights advocate says @entity23 prisoners have access to weapons and drugs
prisoners were recently allowed to open a 600 - person night club , @entity248 alleges
but a @entity22 government spokesman says claims of the prison discotheque are " a lie "
a prisoners ' rights group says jails are overcrowded and that violence is common
