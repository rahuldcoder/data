-- " think before you speak " must be high up on the job description for the modern central banker			0
few people hold the power to send markets into fever panic or bullish euphoria by words alone			0
but every time a head of a major central bank takes to a podium , holds a press conference or sits before a panel of politicians , these characteristically modest officials shoulder the weight of the global economy as markets scavenge for clues as to the bank 's next policy move			0
this week , it was once again @entity26 chairman @entity25 's turn , when he faced lawmakers in his semi-annual testimony to @entity29 and the @entity30			1
with his last three public appearances leading to large swings in the markets , @entity25 took a softer tone to reassure @entity35 that the @entity26 was still providing the necessary backstop for the @entity38 economy through its bond - buying program , known as quantitative easing			1

investors have become " addicted " to @entity56 , according to @entity43 , and by @entity26 members speaking out publicly about tapering the program , the central bank is trying to wean the markets off the @entity56 drug			1

@entity43 said that by signaling a gradual slowdown in its asset - purchases program , the @entity26 wants to stem complacency and any repeat of the excessive risk - taking that led to the financial crisis in 2007			1
he said : " universally , every @entity26 member started talking about the possibility of tapering about three or four months ago ... there will be small tapering in september ... $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion maybe [ of the $ 85 billion a month program ]			1

meanwhile , inflation has remained below the @entity26 's target of 2 % per year			2
@entity95 , global head of economics at @entity98 in @entity99 , warns that markets and investors can not expect central banks to fix everything and must " be careful not to over interpret every single little word " that central bank leaders say			0
she cites the role of the @entity107 and its president @entity108 in the eurozone debt crisis as an example of where governments must take responsibility when central banks can not			2
last year at the @entity107 's monthly press conference , @entity108 stated that the euro was " irreversible " and the central bank would do everything within its power to ensure the future of the euro area			2
the mere utterance of those robust statements immediately took the sting out of the eurozone crisis ; borrowing costs for struggling @entity128 and @entity129 dropped , the euro strengthened , markets rallied and the sheer power of central bank rhetoric became apparent to all			0
@entity95 told @entity0 : " it 's really interesting when you see what people listen to and what they do n't listen to because if you look at every single press conference since then , @entity108 has said that @entity142 policymakers need to move forward on banking union			0
" despite the @entity107 's best efforts to reassure markets and support governments , through its announcement of an unlimited bond - purchasing program last year , dubbed @entity149 , the @entity107 has been reluctant to implement a fully - fledged quantitative easing program similar to that of the @entity26 , @entity152 and the @entity153			1
and @entity43 believes simply announcing the plan is not enough , investors want action			0
