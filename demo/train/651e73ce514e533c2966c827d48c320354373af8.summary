@entity0 -- @entity2 delved wednesday into the politically explosive issue of unmanned drone attacks , questioning the legality of operations increasingly used to combat @entity8 and @entity9 militants in countries such as @entity11			1
in the eight years of @entity13 's presidency , unmanned aircraft -- or drones -- attacked militant targets 45 times			0
since president @entity19 took office , the numbers have risen sharply : 51 last year and 29 so far this year			1
most attacks have targeted suspected militant hideouts in @entity11			0
while the @entity23 is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- @entity23 officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes			1
based on a @entity1 count , all of the 29 drone strikes this year have hit locations in @entity34 and @entity35 , along the 1,500 - mile porous border that @entity11 shares with @entity38			2
several top @entity23 law professors debated the legality of the attacks in a hearing before the @entity43 on @entity44 and foreign affairs , the second such hearing held by the subcommittee within the past two months			1
" the @entity23 is committed to following international legal standards , " said rep. @entity48 , @entity49 , the subcommittee 's chairman			1
" our interpretation of how these standards apply to the use of unmanned weapons systems will set an example for other nations to follow			0
" the four legal scholars invited to testify , however , offered sharply contrasting views of what constitutes an acceptable legal standard			0
the biggest controversy appeared to surround the legality of strikes conducted by @entity67 operatives , as opposed to strikes by the @entity23 military			1
" only a combatant -- a lawful combatant -- may carry out the use of killing with combat drones , " said @entity70 , a professor from the @entity72 law school			0
" the @entity67 and civilian contractors have no right to do so			2
they do not wear uniforms , and they are not in the chain of command			0
and most importantly , they are not trained in the law of armed conflict			0
" @entity70 also said that " we know from empirical data ... that the use of major military force in counterterrorism operations has been counterproductive			0
" the @entity23 government , she said , should use force only " when we can accomplish more good than harm , and that is not the case with the use of drones in places like @entity11 , @entity99 and @entity100			2
" @entity101 , a professor from @entity103 law school in @entity104 , @entity105 , defended the drone attacks on the grounds that there is " no dispute that we are in an armed conflict with @entity8 and with the @entity9			1
" that fact " allows the @entity23 to call upon the full scope of authority which is provided by the law of war			1
" @entity101 said there is " nothing within the law of war that prohibits the use of drones			0
in fact , the ability of the drones to engage in a higher level of precision and to discriminate more carefully between military and civilian targets than has existed in the past actually suggests that they 're preferable to many older weapons			0
" he conceded , however , that there are legitimate concerns about the @entity67 's use of drones			2
@entity67 personnel are " clearly not lawful combatants , [ and ] if you are not a privileged combatant , you simply do n't have immunity from domestic law for participating in hostilities			1
" @entity101 warned that " any @entity67 personnel who participate in this armed conflict run the risk of being prosecuted under the national laws of the places where [ the combat actions ] take place			2
" @entity67 personnel , he said , could be guilty of war crimes			2
@entity148 , the founding director of @entity150 's @entity149 , said the @entity23 government has engaged in targeted killings of individual combatants dating at least back to a 1916 border war with @entity156 bandits			2
banks said the authors of the 1947 @entity159 , which traditionally gives the @entity67 much of its legal authority , probably did n't contemplate the targeted killings tied to drone attacks			1
but the statute , he said , was " designed as dynamic authority to be shaped by practice and by necessity			0
" " the intelligence laws permit the president broad discretion to utilize the nation 's intelligence agencies to carry out national security operations , implicitly including targeted killing , " he said			0
@entity23 laws " supply adequate -- albeit not well - articulated or understood -- legal authority for these drone strikes			1
" the @entity178 sent a public letter to @entity19 on wednesday that said the drone attacks are part of an illegal program authorized by the administration allowing suspected terrorists -- including @entity23 -- to be targeted and killed by @entity23 operatives			1
" the program you have reportedly endorsed is not simply illegal but also unwise , because how our country responds to the threat of terrorism will in large measure determine the rules that govern every nation 's conduct in similar contexts , " @entity178 executive director @entity186 said			1
" if the @entity23 claims the authority to use lethal force against suspected enemies of the @entity23 anywhere in the world -- using unmanned drones or other means -- then other countries will regard that conduct as justified			0
the prospect of foreign governments hunting and killing their enemies within our borders or those of our allies is abhorrent			0
" @entity214 , a fellow at the @entity215 , a nonpartisan group , suggested that the increase in drone attacks during the @entity19 administration is , in part , revenge for the bombing of a @entity67 base in eastern @entity38 that killed seven @entity23 on december 30 , 2009			1
" the people who died in this suicide attack were involved in targeting people on the other side of the border , " he said earlier this year			0
@entity228 , an online publication that charts data for @entity23 airstrikes against @entity8 and the @entity9 in @entity11 , says the air campaign " remains the cornerstone of the effort to root out and decapitate the senior leadership of @entity8 , the @entity9 , and other allied terror groups , and to disrupt both @entity8 's global and local operations in @entity38 and @entity11			1
" such attacks , which have taken a civilian toll in many cases , have frequently caused tension between @entity11 and the @entity23			2
@entity1 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
