-- when it comes to rebooting @entity4 's tale of an adolescent web crawler , @entity1 seems more than happy to sing the same old song with today 's release of " @entity8			1
" only 10 years have passed since @entity9 started swinging through the urban jungle in " @entity8 , " and now @entity11 is stepping into his flight path in what often feels like a straight - up remake			1
considering how important the idea of evolution is to this story , is it unreasonable to expect something more inventive than the same origin tale ? note to @entity1 : the entire planet saw @entity26 's " @entity8 , " and you guys know this better than anyone ! @entity28 iconic scenes from " @entity29 , " " @entity30 " and " @entity31 " only makes matters worse			1
yes , there are variations ; " @entity36 " is n't a carbon copy			0
and , to some extent , there are improvements			2
the biggest plus point has to be @entity11 , the @entity41 actor who played @entity43 's former friend and ally in " @entity45			1
" at 28 , @entity11 's slightly older than @entity9 was when he played @entity46 in 2002 , but his combination of fresh - faced innocence , nervous agitation and wry humor is immediately appealing			1
@entity11 's @entity46 is still very much a boy -- the prologue introduces him as a child , searching for the father he 's about to lose			1
he 's a good - hearted , curious kid who is n't prepared for the hormonal surges that sweep his body shortly after he 's been bitten by a genetically modified spider in the research laboratory of one dr. @entity58 ( @entity59 )			0
the next thing @entity46 knows , he 's climbing the walls			1
he 's stronger , stickier and getting a good deal further than he ever thought possible with @entity63 ( @entity64 )			0
not surprisingly , director @entity65 -- whose last film was the sleeper rom - com " ( 500 ) @entity68 " -- employs a deft hand with the relationship scenes , and @entity11 and @entity64 have a nice , frisky rapport			2
the dialogue scenes are light and " on point			0
" but none of this can dispel the whiff of déjà vu			1
at least we get a new bad guy			0
when the semi-sympathetic dr. @entity58 rashly doses himself into a poor man 's @entity81 -- a middle - aged @entity83 -- @entity65 dutifully strings together three or four wham - bang set pieces , including a novel interlude in the sewers , where @entity46 spins his own advance warning system , a welcome breath of presumably foul air after all his usual zip - lining antics			2
the action is mostly coherent and the @entity93 is a notch or four up from the first @entity26 movie , but not a significant advance on the last of them unless you 're crazy for 3 - @entity99 ( a couple of dizzying subjective close - ups do make the case for it -- but they 're the exceptions			0
) this is yet another blockbuster sprinkled with numerous continuity errors , ridiculous coincidences , contrivances and gaping lapses in logic			0
to take just one minor example : an 8 - foot reptile rampages across the @entity113 during rush hour , and no one gets a photograph ? and just because it runs two - and - a - quarter hours does n't mean you should expect the filmmakers to tie up loose ends			0
the sinister billionaire who is bankrolling @entity58 ' work , some chap by the name of @entity123 , remains ominously off - screen , and we never do find out what happened to @entity46 's parents			2
but i suppose that 's not carelessness as much as it 's confidence			0
" @entity8 " is slick and entertaining and artfully packaged , and @entity11 is utterly engaging , so yes , you can count on seeing more of the same			1
prepare to be unamazed .			0

" @entity8 " sings the same old song as its *predecessors*
there are some improvements , with the best being @entity11 as @entity46
but none of its *positives* can dispel the whiff of déjà vu
