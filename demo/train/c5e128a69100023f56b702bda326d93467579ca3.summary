editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity20 tailor @entity19 specializes in making garments that enable the wearer to get shot at point - blank range with nary an injury besides , maybe , a bruised ego			1
at - high - risk - of - catching - a - bullet demographics , such as rappers and politicians all over the world , rely on @entity19 's handiwork			1
and , lucky me , when i was recently in @entity33 for @entity9 covering a few stories , i had the chance to visit @entity19 's shop , learn about his protective clothing , and get shot in the gut by him			1
upon arriving at @entity19 's warehouse one sunny morning , i received a guided tour from a friendly office assistant			1
it all seemed totally benign -- sweet middle aged ladies stitching together jackets and blazers , smiling at me as i walked by			0
i could 've been at @entity49 's @entity48 warehouse			2
but when i sat down with @entity19 and he got into the whole spiel about why he made the type of clothing he did , nervousness started to set in			1
was this guy seriously going to put a thin jacket on me and then shoot me with a real live handgun ? the man is running a multimillion - dollar international business			2
is he really so confident in his wares that he 's going to risk it all by potentially killing a novice @entity63 journalist on camera ? the answer was yes			2
but first he had to finish telling me about himself			0
@entity19 explained his business model to me , and it was hard to dispute the logic			1
the world 's an increasingly dangerous place for political leaders and citizens alike			2
@entity19 is simply combining the need for safety with the natural desire to look good			1
watch more videos from around the globe on @entity9 and judging by his success , i 'm not the only one who gets it			1
there were rumors that president @entity83 wore some of @entity19 's goods during his inauguration			1
plus , look at the automobile industry			0
not long ago , hummers were the province of soldiers in combat			0
today , they 're a staple of suburban strip malls			0
how long until @entity19 's pieces follow suit ? by this point , @entity19 seemed very determined to prove the reliability of his products to me			1
i figured it would be somewhat staged : i 'd sign something , be ushered into a safe room , and he 'd fire a couple blanks into some military grade flak jacket			2
instead , my new buddy @entity19 popped the question mid-interview in his office			1
and it was n't really a question			0
i believe he said , " now we 'll do a demonstration with you			0
" not exactly a request			0
he stood up from his desk , opened a drawer , and casually pulled out a .38			2
this was happening very fast			0
he moved me over to the side of the room , outfitted me with some noise - reducing headphones , and offered me a black suede jacket			0
after instructing me to take a deep breath on " 1 " and prepare for a gunshot on " 3 , " he shot me in the gut on " 2			1
" obviously i lived to tell the tale			0
but -- most importantly -- i like to think that i looked damn good doing it .			0
