-- @entity1 has extended his lead to seven shots at the @entity4 in @entity5 after posting a second round four - under par 68			1
the @entity6 could n't match his course record - equaling opening round of 62 in friday 's second round , but is firmly in the box seat not only to claim a maiden win at the event but also take over from @entity13 as the world @entity14			1
a win for the current world no. 2 on sunday would still leave him fractionally behind @entity13 in the rankings but he will assume top spot if the 14 - time major champion , who is currently injured , does n't play before next month 's masters at @entity23			1
the two - year rolling points system which looks likely to hand defending @entity25 champion @entity1 the top ranking spot may not be immediately easy to understand , but the 33 - year - old 's dominance at @entity29 is clear for all to see			2
@entity1 's two - round 14 - under par total ties the 36 - hole record at the course and leaves him seven clear of @entity31 's @entity30 and @entity32 and @entity33 from @entity34			1
" i think it was a pretty good way to back up a low round , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's not easy to do that , especially around a tough course			0
" and i think the first hole was key in keeping some momentum out of yesterday , making kind of a scrappy par and a good putt on the 1st to feel like i 'm heading in the right direction to start the day , " he added			0
" i think you have those days like yesterday where it seems every yardage is perfect and you 've got the read on every putt and things just happen			0
" and as soon as you do n't have that perfect yardage , maybe on the first few holes , the pin 's a little tucked and it 's not shaping up for you , it all becomes a lot harder			2
" elsewhere , @entity60 's five - under 67 was the best of the day and lifted the @entity31 to joint fifth on six under with five other players including compatriot @entity64 and @entity65 from @entity66 who both shot second rounds of 71			0
@entity69 's @entity68 and @entity70 from @entity71 are two of six players on five - under par. read more : woods a doubt for @entity23 read more : @entity76 's favorite bunker			0

world no. 2 in *command* at @entity4 in @entity5
@entity1 adds four - under 68 to opening round 62 to reach 14 under after 36 holes
@entity6 could topple @entity13 as world no. 1 with a win this *weekend*
