@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's government appeared tuesday to have lost control of @entity0 , where demonstrators angry over what they see as the @entity8 ' role in starting the ongoing cholera epidemic controlled many of the streets for a second consecutive day			1
at the airport in the country 's second - largest city , commercial flights were suspended tuesday			2
police were not wearing uniforms in an apparent attempt to elude the wrath of @entity1 , who had torched at least one police station on monday			1
the only way to get from the airport into town was by motorcycle			2
barricades composed of burning tires and vehicles blocked cars from traveling on many of the roads			2
as the sun set , smoke from the many fires mixed with tear gas fired by peacekeepers , and hovered over the city			2
the office of prime minister @entity38 had said early in the day that it was sending a delegation of government ministers by helicopter from the capital city of @entity44 to @entity0 in an attempt to orchestrate a return to order , but by nightfall they were not visible			1
in @entity0 , at least one demonstrator was killed in riots monday by a @entity8 peacekeeper			1
at a hotel , guests were hunkered down , unwilling to brave the chaos of the streets			0
the focus of the the @entity1 ' ire centers on their contention that the cholera outbreak blamed for more than 1,000 deaths was started when untreated sewage from a @entity62 contingent of peacekeepers entered the water supply			1
that assertion has been denied by the @entity8			0
protesters have demanded that the @entity8 forces pull out of @entity1			1
@entity0 is in @entity1 's @entity68 , which has had the nation 's highest rate of cholera deaths			1
of the 1,578 people hospitalized in the department from cholera , 119 have died			0
the 7.5 percent death rate is the nation 's highest , according to figures released tuesday by the @entity78			2
the @entity8 stabilization mission in @entity1 charged that the riots may be politically motivated in advance of elections set for november 28			1
" the way in which the events unfolded leads to the belief that the incidents had a political motivation , aimed at creating a climate of insecurity on the eve of the elections , " the @entity8 mission , known by the acronym @entity84 , said in a statement tuesday			1
" @entity84 calls on the population to remain vigilant and not let itself be manipulated by the enemies of stability and democracy in the country , " the statement said			1
@entity101 , a spokeswoman for the @entity8 , said at least one @entity8 warehouse has been looted and that a flight that was to have carried cholera supplies intended for @entity0 was suspended			1
" @entity0 is very serious for cholera right now , " she said			1
" you ca n't run cholera response in this atmosphere			0
" in the town of @entity111 , northeast of the capital , about 400 demonstrators protested the peacekeepers , six of whom were injured , said @entity116 , a spokesman for @entity84			1
" this is a situation that began with a child who was in agony with cholera , " said @entity117 , a former minister of education and presidential candidate who was campaigning for the upcoming elections			2
" they were calling ambulances and @entity84 but nobody came			1
the kid died in front of many people and made the people furious			0
" @entity132 insisted the protests were spontaneous			0
" the @entity62 [ peacekeepers ] are their target , " added @entity132 , who said he was stranded at a local hotel overnight after the riots erupted on monday and the airport shut			1
" people believe the cholera came from @entity62			1
" in @entity144 , a municipality in the @entity0 arrondissement , a protester was killed after he was hit by a peacekeeper who fired in self defense , the @entity8 said			1
the cholera outbreak , which was confirmed last month in northwest @entity1 , has killed 1,034 of the 16,799 people who had been hospitalized with the disease , the @entity78 reported			1
it has been confirmed in seven of the country 's 10 departments			2
so far , the government has been keeping track of the outcome only for those patients who have sought treatment in hospitals			2
" we are now trying to ramp up the collection of data from the communities so that we can get a more realistic figure , " deputy special representative and humanitarian coordinator @entity159 told reporters monday at the @entity8 in a teleconference call from @entity44			0
" we expect to have , once that data comes in , a significant increase in recorded cases			0
" but counting the deaths that occur in the community will be difficult , said @entity172 spokesman @entity171			0
he noted that care is being provided by " tons of @entity175 , " each with their own hospitals and health centers			0
" we 're trying to integrate everything so we have one main source of information for @entity1 , and that 's a real challenge			1
" the government was trying to halt the spread of rumors and to educate the populace via radio and television programs about how to stem the spread of the disease , which experts say is relatively easy to treat through oral - rehydration therapy , and to prevent , through good hygiene			1
both are often in short supply in much of @entity1 , the hemisphere 's poorest country			1
its already fragile infrastructure was worsened during last january 's earthquake , which killed more than 200,000 people			2
since then , more than 1 million people have been living in makeshift camps in and around the capital			0
still , many of the camps are equipped with latrines and most people in the camps are getting clean , chlorinated water , @entity159 said			0
" our concern has been , i must say , less for the camps than it has been for the slums , " he added , citing the @entity209 slum in the capital as an example			0
it has neither latrines nor access to clean water , ripe conditions for the spread of the disease			2
" it is moving more rapidly in the slums than in the camps , " he said			0
despite the dire conditions and the mounting death count , he said , " the government strategy , which we support at the moment , is to look at ways in which the ( november 28 ) elections can go ahead -- even with the situation of cholera			1
" planning has begun on how to disinfect polling booths between voters , he said			0
the situation has gone far beyond one of health or sanitation , he said			0
" it 's an issue , obviously , of national security			2
" efforts are under way to get 10,000 to 12,000 more " cholera beds " in place , and plans are being put in place to transport the sickest people to treatment centers , which some residents do n't want , he said			0
" one of the demonstrations in @entity44 was against the transport of sick people from a triage center to a cholera treatment center , " he said			0
the government has asked @entity1 's mayors to handle the disposition of bodies , but city authorities need help on how to do that , he said			1
the team leader in @entity1 for the @entity265 's anti-cholera effort said the agency determined that the strain of the bacteria is found not only in @entity269 but elsewhere			1
" this is not an uncommon strain , " dr. @entity270 told @entity2 in a telephone interview from @entity44			0
" it 's around the world			2
" he described the bacteria , orginally found in the @entity277 in the country 's northern region , as " like a hitchhiker , " having arrived in @entity1 through contaminated food , water , or in an infected individual who may have had no symptoms			1
" trying to figure out who did it and what country they came from , i think , is extremely challenging to do , probably not possible , " @entity270 said			0
" what we should focus on , as we have been , is preventing deaths			0
" those prevention efforts include training health care workers , few of whom have experience treating patients who may be losing up to a liter of water per hour			0
" it requires some training " to manage them well , he said			0
the goal , he added , is to get mortality to less than 1 percent , " and we 're not there yet			0
" indeed , as of tuesday , the death rate among hospitalized patients with cholera was 3.9 percent nationwide , according to the @entity78			0
the @entity8 , which has appealed to international donors for $ 164 million in aid , said it anticipates as many as 200,000 @entity1 will be sickened with cholera over the next six to 12 months			1
symptoms of the acute , bacterial illness , which is caused by drinking tainted water , can be mild or even nonexistent			0
but sometimes they can be severe : leg cramps , profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting , which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration , shock and death			0
