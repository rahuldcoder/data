-- barely a day passes without news of another major computer security breach			1
last week a hacking network named " @entity4 " began their attack on the personal data of celebrities , officially adding the glitterati to a roll of shame that already includes targets as diffuse as @entity14 , the @entity15 and @entity16			0
however only a few days before the emergence of this latest hacking outfit , a far less conspicuous but similarly - skilled group met at a @entity21 hotel to discuss the other side of all matters of information security , otherwise known as " infosec "			1
the inaugural @entity25 was @entity27 's first major conference for the good guys of infosec			1
among the 300 delegates and speakers were a number of so - called " white hats " , programmers and penetration testers specifically employed to discover businesses ' weak spots			0
using information from these ethical hackers , manufacturers can remedy or " patch " the problem before its release and companies can take measures to safeguard their data			1
although their more destructive brethren might continue to grab headlines , @entity25 demonstrated that the fight against hackers , and other more traditional threats to information security , is also strong			1
" the way people use and consume media and share information has drastically changed over the past ten years , " said @entity53 , a security professional and co-founder of @entity25			1
" the information that we used to think would stay on a computer , in an increasingly networked world , it goes everywhere			1
so there is an increasing demand for people to secure that information because otherwise people wo n't put it there			1
" @entity25 attracted representatives from governments and members of the military , alongside risk managers , consultants and students			0
according to @entity53 , the roll call included " hackers , freaks , geeks , spooks and kooks , " none of whom was required to identify themselves further than a first name			1
" it 's everyone around the table all looking at the same problems and hopefully coming up with some solutions , " @entity53 said			2
high - profile hacking is only one strand of the ongoing battle to protect electronic information from damage or infiltration			2
events at @entity25 ran the gamut from workshops demonstrating old - fashioned lock - picking with a paperclip , through discussions of threats to @entity106 and smart phones and even a presentation of how @entity110 's transmissions to astronauts have recently been intercepted			2
" we 've got a serious problem here ... like the global financial crisis , " said @entity112 , a researcher at the infosec consultancy , @entity113			0
but although @entity112 also referred to " our upcoming security apocalypse " , others were focused on how intelligence can be used to predict attacks before they occur and , crucially , how to acquire boardroom backing for improved security measures			2
@entity124 professionals often converse in a language that is not always immediately accessible to a layman ( executives included ) , but the result of their endeavors can often be startlingly clear			2
" every single guy at boardroom level that i speak to says , ' are we going to be the next @entity14 ? ' " said @entity53 , referring to the recent devastating hack on the electronics giant			0
" everybody had a look at the @entity14 thing and thought , ' oh @entity139 , i hope i 'm not next			0
' " @entity14 given ' epic fail ' award from hackers several presentations at @entity25 offered chilling demonstrations of the vulnerabilities of common business devices			1
@entity147 , a consultant at @entity148 , who described himself as someone who has been " professionally breaking things " for many years , performed a so - called " drive - by " exploit on a @entity152 smart phone			0
independent security consultant , @entity154 , performed a take - down of the much garlanded online banking security software @entity157 , running a key - logging program that replicated on screen anything a user might be entering into supposedly secure password fields			2
another security expert @entity162 showcased the most recent version of @entity164 , software that analyzes and compares freely available information from numerous social networking sites			1
using the website of the executive office of the president as an example , @entity162 was able to extract specific information such as favored restaurants among @entity174 staffers , as well as other behavioral trends			1
" even if we do n't want to attack , what can we learn ? " @entity162 asked , before revealing that at least one member of the @entity180 administration was a fan of @entity181 , visited a psychic medium named " @entity184 the @entity183 " and was a keen editor of @entity187 pages			0
the examples were deliberately banal and outdated , but the implication was clear			0
through similar paths , hackers of more nefarious intentions could determine what versions of browsers are being used in the @entity174 , for instance , and probe specific vulnerabilities			0
" if you can exploit the browser of a leader , then you 've exploited the pc of a president , " @entity162 warned			0
however it was left to @entity204 , a former confidence trickster who appeared in a @entity27 tv show called " @entity208 " , to sum up the challenges still faced by the infosec sector			0
" the general public will only take steps to protect themselves if they know what the dangers are , " he said .			0
