-- the inside accounts of the @entity4 administration 's internal debate over @entity5 may be grabbing the headlines , but former defense secretary @entity8 ' new memoir has some other eye - openers as well			1
yes , @entity8 levels blistering criticism at @entity12 , vice president @entity13 and former colleagues and describes @entity16 aides working to undercut president @entity4 's confidence in his own commanders			1
but in " duty : memoirs of a secretary at war , " the low - key @entity27 -- who replaced @entity28 at the @entity29 late in @entity31 's administration and was kept on by @entity4 when he took office in 2009 -- also talks about his own moments of doubt , anger and frustration			1
here are a few items from the book that may surprise readers			2
-- take this job and shove it : gates fantasized about quitting " all too frequently , sitting at that witness table , the exit lines were on the tip of my tongue : ' i may be the secretary of defense , but i am also an @entity43 citizen , and there is no son of a bitch in the world who can talk to me like that			1
' it was , i am confident , a widely shared fantasy throughout the executive branch			0
" -- @entity31 and @entity4 ' had much more in common than i expected			1
' that was n't always good " both were most comfortable around a coterie of close aides and friends ( like most presidents ) and largely shunned the @entity61 social scene			0
both , i believe , detested @entity12 and resented having to deal with it , including members of their own party			0
and so , unfortunately , neither devoted much effort to wooing or even reaching out to individual members or trying to establish a network of allies , supporters -- or friends , " @entity8 writes			1
" they both had the worst of both worlds on @entity74 : they were neither particularly liked nor feared			0
accordingly , neither had many allies in @entity12 who were willing to go beyond party loyalty , self - interest , or policy agreement in supporting them			0
" however , @entity8 adds , " i liked and respected both men			1
" " i witnessed both of those presidents make decisions they believed to be in the best interest of the country regardless of the domestic political consequences , both thereby earning my highest possible respect and praise			0
although , as i 've said , political considerations were far more a part of national security debates under @entity4 , time and again i saw him make a decision that was opposed by his political advisers or that would be unpopular with his fellow @entity96 and supportive interest groups			1
" -- the price of public service : @entity8 writes that he spent $ 40,000 on lawyers to help him fill out financial disclosures and other government paperwork			1
before his 2006 confirmation hearing , he filled out a 65 - page questionnaire from the @entity105			2
at one point , @entity31 's chief of staff , @entity112 , " asked if i had any ethical issues that could be a problem , like hiring illegal immigrants as nannies or housekeepers			1
" i decided to have some fun at his expense and told him we had a non-citizen housekeeper			0
before he began to hyperventilate , i told him she had a green card and was well along the path to citizenship			0
i do n't think he appreciated my sense of humor , " @entity8 wrote			2
he told his wife , " i have to do this , but i just hope i can get out of this administration with my reputation intact			0
" -- ' i could n't sleep that night ' @entity8 writes that an encounter with a woman in a restaurant who had two sons fighting in @entity133 drove home the human dimension of the job			1
" i could n't finish my dinner , and i could n't sleep that night , " he wrote			0
" our wars had just become very real to me , along with the responsibility i was taking on for all those in the fight			0
" -- time to go : by early 2011 , " my fuse was really getting short			2
it seemed like i was blowing up -- in my own , quiet way -- nearly every day , and no longer just in the privacy of my office with my staff ... i had blown up at ( @entity149 and the vice president at a meeting on @entity152 on march 2 and at @entity154 chair @entity153 on the third , and had come close to openly arguing with the president in the @entity157 meeting that same day , and had gone off on @entity158 again on the fifth			0
partly , i think , i was just exhausted from the daily fights			1
" in addition , he wrote that his desire to protect @entity43 troops -- " from the wars we were in and from new wars -- was clouding my judgment and diminishing my usefulness to the president , and this is played a part in my decision to retire			2
" he left that june , with @entity4 awarding him the @entity173 -- the highest @entity43 civilian honor -- on his way out .			2
