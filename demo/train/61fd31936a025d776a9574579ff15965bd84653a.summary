@entity0 said she ran " to make a difference " and not to make history			1
but she said she hopes the @entity5 will be more reflective of @entity15 and the " life experience " of women			2
" having a seat at the table matters and i think we will see a @entity5 that is more reflective of @entity15			1
we 're certainly not there yet , but this will be a change that moves us forward , " she told @entity21			0
" people ... see our country and our states moving toward full equality in many respects , " @entity0 said			1
" when you have legislative bodies that look more like @entity15 , that happens			0

" for the @entity60 person growing up in @entity4 or anywhere across the country , seeing an openly gay woman who is able to rise up to become a senator in the @entity53 is an incredible role model , " said @entity70 , president of the @entity71			1
though @entity0 's sexual orientation makes her victory notable , it rarely came up during the campaign , unless it was called a nonissue			1
the race pitted @entity8 's " conservative leadership " platform against @entity0 's progressive agenda			1
