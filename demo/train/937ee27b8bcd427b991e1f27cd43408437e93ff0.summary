@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 plans " something really unusual and different " when he hands over " @entity4 " to @entity5 on may 29 , 17 years after @entity6 left the hosting duties to him			1
@entity3 begins " the @entity9 " in september			1
his last " @entity4 " is may 29			1
but do n't expect an emotional final show , since @entity3 and most of his staff are just moving across the @entity14 lot to produce a nightly prime time show debuting in september			1
the traditional desk , chair and guest sofa probably wo n't follow @entity3 to his 10 p.m. show , but many of his favorite comedy elements will , @entity3 said			1
making people laugh before they go to bed is still the mission			0
" to me , 10 o'clock is like the new 11:30 , " @entity3 said			1
" i hear more and more people , even young people , say ' i ca n't stay up past 11			0
@entity28 car pool , i got ta get up at 6			0
' " " the @entity9 " will be competing against scripted dramas , not other comedians telling jokes , which @entity3 said should give him the edge over the long haul			1
" when i was a kid , there was comedy all over tv , and it was fun to watch , whether it was @entity38 or any of the sitcoms , " he said			2
" you 'd have a whole night of comedy , and now everything is very serious and it 's all murder			2
" the new show will have famous guests , but they will not drive the ratings , @entity3 said			1
" it 's all about the joke material , " he said			0
he will " try to keep it moving " with a longer monologue with dozens of jokes , he said			0
the last half - hour will be filled with comedy , he said			2
" you look right in the camera , you directly talk to people as low - tech as possible , a little humor before people go to bed , " he said			0
@entity14 's decision to put a talk - variety show on at 10 o'clock raised some complaints from affiliate station owners , worried the ratings would n't be strong enough to build an audience for their 11 o'clock local newscasts			1
the network 's @entity66 affiliate briefly threatened to move its news to 10 , pre-empting @entity3			1
@entity3 , who grew up in @entity66 , said he understood the economics behind the concern			2
" although my job previous to this was to give a good lead - in to @entity73 , the job giving a good lead - in to the 11 o'clock news is really , really important , " he said			0
" that 's really where our local affiliates make their money , is on the 11 o'clock news			0
" he does n't expect to beat the dramas the first week out , but he noted those shows produce only about 22 new episodes a year			0
" during those repeat weeks and whatever , we 'll be live , fresh , original shows , " @entity3 said			2
the last week of " @entity4 with @entity3 " will include a lot of looking back and " best of " segments , " because that 's easier than writing new stuff , " @entity3 said			1
his guests monday through thursday include @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			0
@entity5 will be on the final show , along with singer @entity98			0
@entity98 's songs were the last thing @entity3 heard on the radio when he left @entity66 in the late 1970s to start his career , so he wanted to have him as his last musical guest , he said			1
@entity3 hinted the last show would have some surprises			1
" i have something really unusual and different planned , " he said , " something really out of left field that we 're going to end on			0
" pressed for more hints , @entity3 said it was " something really personal , something that has to do with show and staff			1
" " i think it will make people smile , " he said			0
@entity3 can smile as he moves on , having left the legendary show -- which has had only four hosts in 54 years -- as the top show for the past 16 years			2
" ' @entity4 ' is sort of the @entity121 of television , and you do n't want to be the guy to screw it up , " he said			2
if he fails in the new show , he will be all right , he said			0
" if it did n't work out , then oh well , at least i have this			0
