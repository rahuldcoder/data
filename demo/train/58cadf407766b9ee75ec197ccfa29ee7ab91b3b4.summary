-- the cigarette companies -- and , boy , it 's hard to say this -- may turn out to be right			1
not " right " in the sense we usually think of the word			0
the death , suffering and heartache that cigarettes have brought to millions of families is no longer in serious dispute			1
but in the courts right now , it is beginning to look as if those gruesome , graphic warning illustrations that were supposed to be plastered all over packs of cigarettes might not happen after all			1
you know the illustrations -- there has been abundant advance publicity about them			0
a photograph of a diseased lung , a picture of a tracheotomy hole in a man 's throat , an illustration of a man with his bare chest surgically stitched up , a picture of rotting teeth			0
the full - color illustrations were mandated by the government to cover the entire top half of the front and back of every package of cigarettes			1
they were intended to be so revolting and so visually inescapable that potential customers would turn away			0
but five tobacco manufacturers have argued in federal court that what the government has ordered is in violation of the @entity47			2
the cigarette companies say that freedom of speech must not be trampled upon -- and that for the government to tell private companies what large , ugly , dominant illustrations they must print on their packages is an infringement upon basic @entity56 principles			1
the government derives the power to do this from the @entity60 of 2009 , which was enacted by @entity61			2
the @entity62 , manufacturer of @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity67 cigarettes , has said that the government - ordered images are " intended to elicit loathing , disgust and repulsion			1
" @entity56 district judge @entity73 appears to believe the cigarette manufacturers have a strong case			2
back in november he issued a temporary injunction that blocked the forced publication of the images			0
at a hearing this month , he said : " there 's nothing on the record to suggest that @entity61 gave any clear and thoughtful analysis on the @entity47 implications of this			0
" he promised to have a final ruling soon			0
no matter how much many of us may dislike what cigarettes have done to the nation 's health , the @entity47 argument is a compelling one			1
the government risks setting a troubling precedent when , regardless of how laudable the intentions , it tells someone -- either a person or a company -- that it must say and show things that aggressively advocate against the person 's or company 's own interests			1
that 's the slipperiest of slopes to start sliding down			0
what about the text - only warning labels that have appeared on packs of cigarettes for decades ? the cigarette companies have never liked them either , of course			1
but the argument in court is that there is a legal distinction between requiring labels that state facts and requiring illustrations that serve to actively advocate against the purchase of the product			1
the government believes that public health concerns are paramount ; the cigarette companies contend that nothing outweighs free speech			1
the tobacco manufacturers , as we all know , have long made ample use of their own free speech			1
some of the old advertisements for cigarettes , when you come upon them now , are simply astonishing			2
i recently saw a november 1936 national magazine advertisement for @entity135 , which presented cheerful , colorfully illustrated , course - by - course instructions on how to smoke five cigarettes at the table during @entity140 dinner to achieve " the peaceful feeling that comes from good digestion and smoking @entity135			2
" among the tips : start with tomato soup and " smoke a @entity63 right after the soup			0
" before asking for a second helping of turkey , " smoke another @entity63			0
" after the salad course , another @entity63 , which " clears the palate and sets the stage for dessert			0
in 1954 , when health concerns about cigarettes were gaining momentum , the @entity156 brand took out a double - spread national magazine ad that all but mocked the medical evidence			2
" @entity56 , we love you ! " the ad began			0
" thanks again for putting your trust in the cigarette made by tobacco men ... not medicine men ... we promise ! @entity156 will continue to cure just one thing : the world 's best tobaccos ... @entity172 for a treat instead of a treatment			2
" if , in 2012 , cigarettes were a new prescription drug , or a new over-the - counter medication , or a new snack , and the government knew what it knows now about the health ramifications , such a product would never be approved for consumer use			1
it would be yanked from the shelves right away			0
but cigarettes are n't a new product			1
they have a history of being sold legally			0
so the government is telling the manufacturers that they must run those illustrations to drive people away			2
will it transpire -- will the government get its way ? or will the cigarette companies ' @entity47 argument prevail ? it has long been axiomatic that free speech stops at the right to yell " fire ! " in a crowded theater			1
but do cigarette marketers have the unfettered right to enthusiastically yell " @entity207 ! " to a crowded nation ? you can almost bet that this one is going to end up in front of the @entity56 @entity211			0
what a case it will be			0
join the conversation on @entity217			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			1

@entity220 : cigarette companies fighting a government mandate ; they may be right
they say requiring them to show graphic warnings on packs hurts free speech
whatever you think about *scourge* of cigarettes , their argument is compelling , he says
@entity220 : cigarette companies have long pushed a dangerous product . do they have the right ?
