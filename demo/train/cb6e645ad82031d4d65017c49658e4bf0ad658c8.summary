@entity0 -- amid criticism that he 's fanned tensions between the public and police , @entity0 's mayor met with the families of two slain officers on monday			1
" they are in tremendous pain , " mayor @entity9 told reporters , " and they are worried deeply			1
" the mayor said speaking with officer @entity16 ' two teenage sons made him think of his own children			1
" you have two teenage , good young men , who no longer have a father because of an assassin , " @entity9 said			0
" i told them that i lost my own dad when i was 18 , and that as painful and difficult as it is , families come together			2
people find a way forward , " he said			0
" i also told them that we would be there for them			0
that the @entity32 family would be there for them and the people of @entity0 and the family of @entity0 would be there for them , and we will be			1
" officer @entity38 's family also is devastated , @entity9 said			2
his parents are mourning the loss of their only child , and his wife of just two months is facing the heartbreaking reality of losing her husband in an instant			0
@entity47 repeated his calls to put aside debates and protests and focus on the officers ' grieving families			1
" it was an attack on every single @entity0 and we have to see it as such , " he said			1
the slain officers are " now our family and we will stand by them , " de @entity9 said			1
" our first obligation is to respect these families in mourning			2
" he also pushed back against his critics , calling remarks from the head of the city 's police union " wrong and mistaken , " and accusing the media of contributing to the atmosphere of tension between police and protesters			1
police investigators told reporters they 're trying to piece together where the gunman who ambushed and killed the two officers saturday was in the hours before the shooting			1
officials told reporters monday there 's a roughly two - hour gap in the timeline they 've assembled leading up to the shooting , and they asked for the public 's help to pinpoint where shooter @entity84 was before the incident			2
police commissioner @entity87 told reporters that investigators believe the gunman acted alone			2
so why is it so important to piece together his every move leading up to the shooting ? " we owe it to the families to find out what happened , " @entity87 said			2
" that 's why we 're seeking to build this case up , so we know going forward exactly who talked to this man			2
" the backlash police say @entity38 and @entity16 were sitting in their patrol car in the @entity105 neighborhood of @entity106 on saturday afternoon when @entity84 ambushed them			1
authorities have n't established the gunman 's motive , but they 've noted that @entity84 , 28 , broadcast his plans to kill police on social media			1
and in some of his posts , investigators have said , he mentioned the cases of @entity118 and @entity119 , @entity122 - @entity121 men who were killed by police			0
@entity84 's sister and aunt told @entity1 affiliate @entity126 that he was estranged from them , deeply troubled and suicidal			0
but the family members said they do n't believe the police officers he killed were targeted for what they represented , despite his social media posts before the shooting			1
" this has nothing to do with police retaliation , " said @entity133 , the gunman 's older sister			1
" this was a troubled , emotionally troubled , kid			0
he did n't get it			0
" since saturday 's shooting , critics have taken aim at @entity9 's comments about the protests surrounding @entity119 , a 43 - year - old who died in july after police in @entity148 placed him in what appeared to be a chokehold			1
a wave of protests erupted in @entity0 -- and nationwide -- after the officer involved was not indicted			1
the head of @entity0 's police union said @entity9 had " blood on his hands			1
" and , in the aftermath of saturday 's shootings , video showed officers turning their back on the mayor as he passed them			1
others have said that @entity9 should not be blamed , arguing that the gunman is solely responsible for the weekend 's bloodshed			0
@entity87 told reporters monday that tensions between @entity0 mayors and police unions are decades in the making			1
" can you point out to me one mayor that has not been battling with the police unions in the last 50 years ? ...			1
so the experience of this mayor , in terms of some cops not liking him , it 's nothing new			1
it 's part of life , it 's part of politics			0
and it is what it is			0
we voice our concerns and we voice our opinions , " @entity87 said			0
" so what i suggest is ... that we will engage in dialogue once we get our officers respectfully mourned and buried , and return to dialogue where we can hopefully resolve whatever differences are out there			0
" ' we can not take this lightly ' but there 's one thing @entity0 's mayor said should n't wait			1
" if you see something on social media that is a threat against a police officer , call 911 immediately , " @entity9 said			1
" we would much rather get too much information than too little			0
" online threats against police officers must be taken seriously to stop future attacks , @entity9 said , referring to social media posts by the gunman who killed the officers			1
" once this individual posted on @entity214 his intention , anyone who sees that has the obligation to call the police immediately and report it , " he said			1
" we can not take this lightly			0
" investigators have been combing through the gunman 's social media posts and looking through his cell phone			1
many of his @entity227 posts show " self despair , " said @entity229 , the @entity32 's chief of detectives			0
there are also anti-government tirades , he said			0
among several thousand images on @entity84 's cell phone , investigators found footage of a recent protest in @entity0 's @entity238 , @entity229 said			1
in the video , recorded around december 1 , " he is a spectator watching one of the protests , " @entity229 said			0
new threats as they grieve the deaths of two of their colleagues , @entity0 police must also deal with a spate of new threats			1

the @entity32 has already pulled all of its auxiliary officers off the streets in the wake of the killings of the two officers			0
auxiliary officers are unarmed volunteer officers who help with traffic control or other minor situations			0
the victims as they grapple with the shooting , @entity9 said @entity16 ' family remains united in their @entity291 faith , their strong sense of family and their belief in public service			2
@entity16 had been scheduled to graduate later saturday afternoon from a community - crisis chaplaincy program , according to the rev. @entity297 , president of the @entity300 chaplain @entity298			2
" he thought being a chaplain was something he could see himself doing as a full - time ministry when he retired from the @entity32 , " @entity301 said			0
" you just looked in his eyes and there was kindness all the way around			1
" a quote on the slain officer 's facebook page says , " if your way is n't working , try @entity315 's way			2
" a funeral service for @entity16 will be held on saturday at @entity317 , the church he 'd attended for nearly 14 years			2
