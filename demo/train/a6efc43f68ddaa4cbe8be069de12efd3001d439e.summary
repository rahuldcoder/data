@entity0 , @entity1 -- after 31 years and two months at @entity4 's @entity0 , @entity3 is joining the ranks of the unemployed			1
he showed up for his last day at 7 a.m. friday , turned in his employee badge and then left to go hunting			2
" i 'm very proud i was a part of this , " he said			0
" there were some challenging times , but i am glad i was part of this team			0
" he is one of more than 1,200 @entity15 employees whose were laid off october 1 : coincidentally , the same day @entity4 began operating in 1958			1
@entity3 , 50 , started his career as a technician on the shuttle thermal protection system and then worked his way up to manager for @entity0 's orbital processing facility			1
now , he 's updating his résumé and taking welding classes at @entity24 in hopes of finding another job			1
" i do n't know how to put 31 years into a sentence , " @entity3 said			1
@entity28 and the others who walked out the door of the @entity0 on friday are some of the nearly 9,000 @entity4 employees whose jobs will be cut as the shuttle program nears its end			1
some of those jobs may be extended if president @entity37 signs the $ 19 billion budget for the space agency , passed by @entity40 this week , that authorizes an additional shuttle launch			1
@entity40 passes @entity4 budget but the extension comes too late for @entity3 and the other @entity15 employees			1
the ending came as no surprise : six years ago , president @entity47 announced that 2010 would be the last year for the shuttle program			1
because many @entity4 workers like @entity3 have specialized jobs , it will be hard to transition from the space agency to other employment			1
with the help of federal funding , @entity1 has set up a transitional program to help aerospace workers prepare for new employment			2
read more coverage from @entity2 affiliate @entity60 many of the @entity4 employees seeking employment help are " like deer in the headlights , " said @entity66 , president of @entity68 , which runs the federally funded aerospace transitional program			1
" first reaction : ' where do i go ? what do i do ? ' " she said , describing @entity4 employees ' responses after being laid off			1
job loss , @entity76 explains , is kind of like a grieving process			0
with the help of the transitional program , aerospace employees are lead through the process of résumé writing , sharpening interviewing techniques and developing skills needed for new jobs			2
many @entity0 workers , like @entity3 , have not written a résumé for more than 30 years			1
transitional instructors teach workers how to include decades of experience into a one - or two - page résumé			2
" you need to have a plan b , " said transitional program director @entity92			0
" the shuttle is retiring , and the end is inevitable			2
" @entity98 aerospace engineer @entity97 took the warning to heart , having worked on shuttles for 23 years			0
this year , he opened two laundromats that he runs in his spare time			0
to ensure that he would succeed as a small - business owner , @entity97 completed the transitional program 's entrepreneur training class			1
" i grew up on shuttle			0
i 've been working on shuttle since i was 18 years old , " @entity97 said			0
" i pretty much live and breathe this stuff			0
i really enjoy what i do			0
" other shuttle workers have had a hard time coming to terms with the idea that there is no definite replacement for shuttle , according to @entity76			2
when @entity47 announced that the shuttle program would end in 2010 , he said it would be replaced by the @entity122 program to return man to the moon and beyond			1
many shuttle workers held out hope that they could find new jobs in the @entity122 , which would have included two new rocket systems and a new crew module to transport astronauts into space			2
from the beginning , @entity122 was plagued by underfunding			0
this year , @entity37 killed the program 's future funding because of budget overruns and because it was behind schedule			1
that could affect more than 20,000 workers along @entity1 's space coast , according to @entity76			0
" we are looking at 9,000 aerospace workers who will be affected with another 14,000 indirectly affected in community , " she said			0
for @entity3 , walking away from @entity0 was not as hard as he thought , he said friday morning			2
he praised @entity15 for going " above and beyond to help their people adjust , from job placement to constant job fairs			0
" but it 's more about just losing a job , he explained			0
" i have a lot of friends , a lot of teammates , " @entity3 said			0
" i wish them all the best , and i 'm going to miss them all			0

more than 1,200 @entity4 workers were laid off friday because of the shuttle program 's end
