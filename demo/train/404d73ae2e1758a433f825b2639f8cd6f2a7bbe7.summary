-- the @entity1 will phase out its stockpiles of landmines designed to target people , moving closer to joining a global ban on a weapon that kills more than 15,000 people a year -- most of them civilians			1
@entity1 officials made the declaration at an anti-mine conference in @entity12 , @entity13 , according to a statement issued by @entity16 spokeswoman @entity15			1
activists have long pressured the @entity1 to join the international treaty banning the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines -- the kind meant to kill or maim when someone steps on them			1
such mines are easily triggered when stepped on , unlike anti-vehicle mines			0
those weapons can still kill , but only go off when heavy vehicles pass over them			0
anti-personnel mines , many of them placed during earlier conflicts dating back years , kill more than 15,000 people a year , according to the @entity34			1

" activists welcomed the @entity1 statement			2
" the message to the international community is clear -- the @entity39 is the only solution to eliminate the suffering caused by landmines , " said the head of the @entity58 delegation to the @entity12 conference			0
but some criticized the @entity1 for failing to commit to a ban on the use of its current stockpiles of mines , and chastised the @entity71 administration for failing to set a date to join the treaty			1
" by not setting a firm date to complete this task , the @entity1 runs the risk of allowing its landmine policy review to drift beyond president @entity71 's term in office as president , " said @entity74 , executive director of @entity75 @entity1 more than 100 million mines are believed to be in stockpiles around the world , with millions already in the ground in 59 countries , according to the @entity43			1
in 1997 , the @entity89 administration made a goal of joining the treaty by 2006 , but president @entity92 reversed the decision in 2004 , according to @entity94			0
in a policy announced that year , the @entity1 said it would no longer use mines made to be invisible to metal detectors and those that do n't self - destruct after a set time			1
in 2009 , the @entity1 announced a comprehensive landmine policy review			2
anti-landmine activists had been pressuring the @entity71 administration to announce the results of that review before the @entity12 conference			0
despite not being part of the treaty , the @entity1 is the largest donor worldwide to efforts to combat landmines and help victims , providing more than $ 2 billion in aid since 1993 , according to the @entity58			2
