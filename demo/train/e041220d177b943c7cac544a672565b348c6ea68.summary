@entity0 -- the @entity5 administration is drafting new plans to hold suspected terrorists without trial indefinitely but allow them to challenge their imprisonment periodically , a @entity3 official said tuesday			1
a proposed executive order would cover prisoners who ca n't be tried in civilian courts or before the military commissions set up at @entity14 , @entity15 , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
the official provided few details , since the draft had not yet been presented to president @entity5			2
but the official said @entity5 had pledged in may 2009 to give suspected terrorists some recourse			2
" we must have clear , defensible and lawful standards for those who fall in this category , " @entity5 said in a 2009 speech at the @entity22			0
" we must have fair procedures so that we do n't make mistakes			0
we must have a thorough process of periodic review , so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified			1
