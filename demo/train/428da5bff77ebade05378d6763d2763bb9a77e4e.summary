-- are you reading this article on your cell phone or tablet ? these days , that makes you pretty normal , especially if you 're @entity6 , according to a recent report from @entity8			1
according to @entity8 , which tracks these sort of things , 55 % of the 234 million cell phone subscribers in the @entity6 are getting at least some of their media diet via mobile devices			1
only @entity15 and the @entity16 had higher levels of mobile media usage			1
people in the @entity6 increasingly purchase more than one device to help them consume all this mobile content			1
according to @entity8 , 14 % of @entity6 cell phone subscribers also own a tablet -- the highest percentage in any of the countries @entity8 examined			1
in contrast , fewer than 5 % of @entity15 mobile subscribers also own a tablet			1
" in less than two years , nearly 40 million tablets were in use among mobile subscribers in the @entity6 , outpacing smartphones -- which took seven years to achieve the same level of adoption , " @entity8 noted			1
driving this sharp growth was the expanded array of @entity38 tablet options , especially @entity40 's @entity39 , released in late 2011			2
also , the @entity42 release yielded another spike in tablet ownership			2
does this mean people are shifting their media experience away from computers and smartphones -- or broadcast and print media -- to tablets ? not necessarily			2
here 's what @entity8 has to say on the matter : " as tablets gain popularity among users , they are not replacing mobile phones or computers			1
rather , it would seem that tablets are supplementing a multi-device diet that is increasingly becoming the norm among consumers			0
... while smartphones may have provided consumers with a first taste of mobile internet connectivity , tablets have furthered the rise of the ' digital omnivore ' -- consumers who now go about their days engaging seamlessly through multiple online touchpoints			2
" seamlessly ? well , sort of			0
a " seamless " cross-device media experience implies that you can easily pick up where you left off when switching devices			1
this is the case when reading @entity39 e-books , whether via the @entity39 smartphone or tablet app , on a @entity39 e-reader or @entity39 tablet , or on a computer			2
similarly , when you stream a @entity81 movie to your tv or computer , and pause it , you can resume watching it from the same point via the @entity81 app for mobile devices			1
but not all services work this well			0
if i 'm watching a short film on the new @entity93 app for @entity38 phones , pause it , put down my phone and turn on my tv , bring up my @entity93 account ( i use @entity98 for streaming media ) , and select the movie i 'd paused ... it takes me back to the start of the movie			1
it does n't remember where i stopped watching			0
gamers often experience similar frustration when they try to continue a game in progress on a different device			0
how well you can sync a game -- if at all -- depends on the game and the devices involved			2
sometimes that experience is seamless			0
and all those long - form articles you want to read ? features like " @entity116 " in @entity118 's safari browser for computers and mobile devices -- or third - party services such as @entity122 -- allow you to sync a list of articles to read across devices			1
but they do n't let you just pick up where you left off in the midst of a 8,000 - word @entity130 's feature story			0
and they may not support offline reading			0
syncing your content across multiple devices is a major technical challenge which will take time to solve			2
but so far , that kind of syncing is n't a big concern for most consumers			0
more commonly , people tend to use different devices to access content at different times of day or in different settings			0
for instance , @entity8 's analysis of traffic to news websites found that from about 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on a typical weekday , computers are the leading source of site traffic			1
tablet traffic to news sites peaks in the evening			0
on weekends , however , tablet traffic to news sites peaks in the morning			0
simultaneous use of multiple devices has already become major part of how we experience media			2
last october , @entity162 found that 40 % of people who own a smartphone or tablet use those mobile devices while watching tv			1
what do people do on their smartphones and tablets while watching tv ? according to @entity162 , " e-mail was the top activity for both men and women during television programming and commercial breaks			0
in addition , women reported engaging in social networking more than men , while men checked sports scores more often			0
" the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity186 .			0

more than half of cell phone owners get some of their media on mobile devices
@entity8 finds *47* % of all @entity6 cell phone owners currently use apps
14 % of @entity6 cell phone subscribers also own a tablet , highest in any country
