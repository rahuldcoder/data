-- in the 100 years since @entity2 army officer @entity1 traversed @entity4 's desert and the half century since @entity5 set out to capture it for his cinematic epic " @entity1 , " the blood red landscape that entranced both men has scarcely changed			1
still " vast , echoing and @entity11 - like " -- as @entity1 wrote in his account of his war experiences " @entity16 " -- the desert 's hidden gems are now accessible to all			1
today , @entity4 is one of the @entity18 's safest tourist destinations and plays host to an endlessly varied landscape			2
fifty years since the film crews left , following in @entity1 , and later @entity5 's , footsteps can still reveal some of @entity4 's finest desert jewels			1
@entity24 when @entity1 , as a junior officer , was first sent out into the desert to locate the @entity29 rebels who he would join in revolt against the @entity31 , he found himself in a vast gorge , where red rock monoliths rose more than 800m into the air around thin sand corridors			0
he was inspired to write of the granite and sandstone cliffs " sheering in like a thousand - foot wave towards the middle of the valley			0
" in the south of modern day @entity4 , 300km from capital city , @entity45 , near the border with @entity47 , the landscape appears unchanged from the scenes described by @entity1 -- the same landscape which lean used as the backdrop for the @entity52 's first encounter with @entity54 ' prince @entity53 -- in what is now a protected @entity56			1
click on the pindrops above to trace @entity58 's @entity4			0
all photos courtesy @entity59 the natural wonder remains awe - inspiring , says travel writer @entity66 who authored the @entity67 to @entity4 : " it 's a very evocative place , the sound is echoing off the walls around you , you 're looking up and down this broad desert canyon with sun coming down and the blue sky above			0
" the desert dunes @entity1 's masterplan of leading an army across the arid brick - red sand of the desert to launch an attack on the coastal town of @entity77 -- an idea considered so perilous that the @entity31 had not bothered to defend against it -- became his defining act			1
those wishing to follow in @entity1 's footsteps can take camel treks from @entity24 , says tourism expert @entity84 , who has worked with @entity4 's @entity86 to develop their @entity58 adventure trails			1
more leisurely tourists can explore the wild terrain from the comfort of 4x4s with air conditioning			0
the real treat , agree @entity84 and @entity66 , is connecting with the culture of the @entity95 , the descendants of those tribesmen who joined @entity1 in revolt and participated in the filming of @entity5 's movie			1
eating lamb cooked slowly in a @entity103 ( sand oven ) in the company of the @entity95 , camping out under the stars in black goat hair tents and seeing the sunset " make the desert come alive , " says @entity66			0
@entity77 at the other edge of the desert lies in the far south of the country , lies @entity4 's tiny @entity112 coast and the coastal fortress which would make @entity1 famous			1
in 1917 , this was where @entity1 claimed credit for uniting @entity95 tribes to mount a surprise attack , emerging from the desert to defeat @entity31 forces whose artillery pointed out to sea			0
in @entity5 's film , @entity1 lures @entity124 's mercenary tribal leader @entity123 to join the attack with the promise of a " great box " of gold in @entity77			1
since then the fortune of the country 's only sea port has only grown : @entity77 now boasts 5 * luxury seaside resorts , beach hotels and a marine park			0
amid this modern day opulence , the historic 14th century fortress is still there , though damaged by @entity1 's attack and an earthquake a decade later , and is open to visitors			1
@entity141 in " @entity16 , " @entity1 described the harsh winter of 1917 when -- as he and @entity53 prepared to lead their troops north to capture @entity145 -- they stopped to rest at the oasis and ancient fort of @entity141			2
far from the path of most tourists , says @entity66 , the fortress -- including @entity1 's room above the gateway -- are now guarded by the direct descendants of those who provided refuge to @entity1 and @entity53 's army			1
visitors willing to travel out to " @entity159 " -- one of a string of desert castles built by the @entity163 in the 7th and 8th century -- can experience the " unfathomable silence " @entity1 recounts in his book			2
while there , visitors can also enjoy the @entity168 , established by the @entity4 @entity169			0
@entity171 bird watching is popular , says @entity66 , with migratory birds stopping in the area to drink at the only oasis in 12,000 square kilometers of desert			0
@entity45 when @entity1 arrived in @entity4 in 1916 , @entity45 was a village , home to the ruins of @entity178 , @entity180 and @entity181 civilizations and a new train station on the @entity183			2
by the time he sat down to write his account in " @entity16 , " the railway was in tatters and @entity45 was capital of the new emirate of @entity188 -- both thanks , chiefly , to @entity53 and @entity1 's revolt			1
today , @entity45 's sprawling business , technology and financial districts dwarf the old town			0
but relics of @entity1 's stay can still be found			2
the original railway carriages dating from 1908 still make chartered journeys from @entity199 , 90km to the south , on one of the last surviving stretches of the @entity183 , says @entity84			0
@entity66 describes an old @entity31 - style building of " creamy limestone , with tiled floors , a semicircular veranda in a wooded garden on the slope of a hill overlooking downtown @entity45			0
" it is now a gallery for contemporary @entity4 and @entity213 art called @entity214			0
but , @entity66 says : " this very beautiful old building was ( @entity2 arab legion commander ) @entity218 's house , and the story goes that when @entity1 was a guest of @entity221 in the early twenties , this house was where he wrote some , or all , of ' @entity16			2
' " the 50th anniversary @entity225 of " @entity1 " opens in cinemas across the @entity2 on 23 november .			1
