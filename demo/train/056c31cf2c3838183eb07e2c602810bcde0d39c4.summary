-- @entity1 has a toothache			2
he thinks he needs a root canal , but the full - time student , 22 , is uninsured			2
he ca n't afford a trip to the dentist			0
" i 'm only working 30 hours a week			0
i would n't have enough money to do something like that , " said @entity1 , a film and video student at @entity9 in @entity10			0
while many young adults are now covered by the @entity17 , able to remain on their parents ' insurance until age 26 , the rules are different for those like @entity1 , who grew up in the foster care system			1
there are more than 400,000 children in foster care in the @entity27 , the @entity23 said last year			1
all are provided with health care coverage as long as they are wards of the state			1
when foster kids turn 18 , they age out of the system and instantly lose their coverage			1
that 's about to change , when another part of @entity17 takes effect on january 1 , 2014			1
medicaid coverage will be extended for former foster youth until they reach 26 , as long as the individual was in foster care and enrolled in @entity44 until the age of 18			1
" i definitely think it would be a big relief , and i would definitely feel more secure as far as my health goes , " @entity1 said			1
but there 's a catch			0
@entity1 has dreams of traveling across the nation and becoming a filmmaker			0
a future relocation could jeopardize his medical coverage			1
states will only be required to keep former foster children on @entity44 if they continue to reside in the state where they were in foster care originally			1
@entity60 : most individual health insurance is n't good enough for @entity17 this part of the provision is " an incredibly troubling aspect , " said @entity66 attorney @entity65 , who founded the child and family advocacy group @entity68			1
young adults can be highly mobile as they move for educational purposes , job opportunities and a host of other reasons , she said			0
" you ca n't be on a film set if you are uninsured , " @entity1 said			0
" you could get hurt			0
i definitely think [ being uninsured ] is limiting and it 's a letdown , because what if i do get a job out of state ? i might not be able to take it			1
" while " it 's a great provision , " said @entity81 , co-executive director of the @entity82 and a professor at the @entity84 , limiting extended @entity44 enrollment because of relocation could threaten the provision 's effectiveness			2
she , @entity65 and other child advocates wrote a letter , circulated by the @entity92 , to the @entity93 at the @entity23 , which is working on the revisions before this part of the @entity17 is implemented in 2014 , asking them to reconsider this limitation			1
even if this part of the @entity17 is reinterpreted , former foster children like @entity1 may face other challenges with the existing system -- namely , not all doctors and dentists accept @entity44			1
@entity103 , 20 , who grew up in foster care in @entity105 , found that out the hard way			2
she needs someone to remove her wisdom teeth , but ca n't find a single dentist who will take her @entity44 card and she ca n't afford to pay for it on her own			0
" my tooth on my left side is coming in sideways , and it 's pushing my other teeth forward , " she said			0
" i ca n't go anywhere because it could cost about $ 3,000 [ including ] the x-rays and everything else that they have to do before			0
" @entity103 believes having coverage extended until she reaches 26 would be " really awesome , " but noted that even those with coverage are limited			1
" people think , ' oh yeah , the foster kids have everything covered for them , they can get everything done with their medical card , ' but it 's not true , " she said			1
" there 's really a lot that we ca n't do			0
" former foster youth works on @entity135 to change child welfare system @entity65 recalls one of her past clients , who she said was " actively psychotic and suicidal " : it took two years for her to obtain medication , @entity65 said , because of the difficulty in finding a psychiatrist who would take @entity44			2
" the reimbursement rates are abysmal " for providers , she said			0
@entity23 has not responded to the child advocates ' letter and did not respond to repeated requests for comment from @entity0 on the matter			0
the advocates , including @entity81 and @entity65 , say enrollment in @entity44 should be faster and easier to ensure all eligible young adults are enrolled without obstacles			0
an outreach campaign could inform eligible individuals so former foster youth are aware of the opportunity , they say			2
" states are still trying to figure out how these former foster youth can be identified , how they can let young adults know that this benefit is open to them and how they can enroll , " @entity65 said			2
@entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

@entity167 kids currently age out of health coverage at 18
a new @entity17 provision takes effect in january , extending coverage to age 26
but moving out of state can end health coverage for former foster kids
