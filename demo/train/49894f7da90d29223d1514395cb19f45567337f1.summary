the @entity16 report says @entity0 was at the county sheriff 's office on another matter when an active warrant for her arrest was discovered			1
chief deputy @entity33 told the station that the store 's owner had asked a @entity12 judge for the warrant years ago when @entity0 did n't return her video			1
