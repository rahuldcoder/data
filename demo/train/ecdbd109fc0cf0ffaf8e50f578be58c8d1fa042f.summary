i recently read seven words that shook me to the core			1
in a mesmerizing interview in the new @entity7 magazine , the civil rights historian @entity4 describes the three @entity8 who were killed in @entity10 50 summers ago			1
all three had understood the dangers of going into the @entity13 to register black voters			2
all had been trained in the practice of radical nonviolence			2
one of them , @entity18 , lived out that ethic as he faced the gun - wielding @entity20 who was about to murder him			1
@entity18 said to the man , calmly , " sir , i know just how you feel			1
" then the man shot him and his two friends			1
put yourself in @entity18 's shoes			1
imagine what it would have taken to summon such stillness , such profound and sincere compassion for one 's killer , at the moment of death			1
and then put yourself in the shoes of that klansman			2
after all , we know this story only because the @entity20 later told it to investigators			1
he was haunted , for the rest of his life , by the depth of empathy that he confronted in that fateful instant			1
this story has stayed with me too , challenging me to admit it when in my comfortable everyday existence i fail to demonstrate even a fraction of that empathy and self - realization			1
but it 's stayed with me in my civic identity as well			1
and it 's made me wonder how much of our political and civic strife could be alleviated if we learned something from a young man who 's been dead a half century but never gave in to fear or hate			1
look around our country today			1
look at the @entity63 policemen who feel so insulted that they think they must turn their backs on their mayor			1
look at the @entity68 - @entity67 citizens of that city who feel that the @entity70 has never shown them the respect those disgruntled officers now demand			2
look at the online comment threads after @entity74 and @entity75			2
look at how black men in hoodies and white men with badges are demonized			0
look at the escalation of outrage that leads to philosophical hashtag wars about whether @entity83 or # @entity84			0
look at the disgust that drips from the lips of @entity88 as they brace for a reactionary @entity89 and from @entity90 as they decry imperious @entity88			0
@entity91 : there are two sides to @entity67 's policing issues look now at the people in your own community			2
look at the way we walk past people whose circumstances are radically different from our own			0
perhaps they are richer or poorer than you , or more liberal or less , or more self - destructive or less			0
look at the way we ascribe moral meaning to those differences			0
look at the way we tell ourselves stories about what our selves are			0
look at the way those stories always accuse others of faults and excuse us for our own			0
look at the way those solipsistic habits , which start with those closest to us , radiate outward			0
i have been guilty of this kind of self - justification , both personal and political			0
and for all of us , this season is an occasion to ask what it would take to earn the right to say these words : i know just how you feel			1
to some people , this kind of radical compassion and loving nonviolence seems dangerously squishy , a slide down the slope to moral relativism			0
they fear that understanding the heart of another person , particularly the enemy , will lead to an obliteration of distinctions between self and other , between right and wrong			0
but that 's not how it was for @entity18 and for the other @entity8			1
they had a crystal - clear understanding of the moral differences between them and the last - stand defenders of @entity150 , between good and evil			0
their capacity for empathy empowered them -- not to subdue others but to invite them into goodness and thereby transform them			2
this power does not come easily			0
it takes a lot to say truly , in the heat of conflict , that you know how your adversary feels			0
and to say nothing more -- no letting him off the hook , no further demonstrations of your goodness			0
frankly , few of us will ever attain the near - saintly disciplined open - heartedness of young @entity18			1
but more of us can come closer			0
and when few of us even bother trying , we get the political culture of today : polarization for its own sake ; politics as a game of annihilation rather than repeat play ; citizens as bloodthirsty spectators			2
as we begin the new year , as conflicts over race and class and guns and belonging continue to rage across the land , let 's resolve to learn just how someone feels			2
and to let that knowledge guide our lives as citizens			0

@entity192 recalls words of civil rights worker before he was shot by @entity196 gunman
@entity18 told his killer : ' i know just how you feel '
@entity192 says we should look to empathy as we confront today 's divides
