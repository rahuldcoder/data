@entity0 -- the occupiers of @entity3 have been portrayed by some as radicals , young kids without focus , ne'er - do - wells who 'd do anything but get a job			1
but one woman used her time in at @entity12 differently , and as a result she has gone from @entity14 to occupying an actual office on @entity3			1
in the gathering of the so - called 99 % , @entity16 had no idea she would be the one who would be working for the 1 %			2
" there were some days it was a carnival , or lots of music , drumming , costumes , marching , protesting , " said @entity16 , describing the weeks she spent demonstrating at the park in downtown @entity20			2
frustrated with the economy , @entity16 says she jumped right into the @entity14 movement -- all in -- banging drums and washing paint - and dirt - covered sidewalks			1
she sounds like the protester stereotype , but she is n't ; she has a doctorate in biochemistry			2
in the past few years , the biochemist said , she had found herself at times unemployed or underemployed			2
until a few weeks ago she decided to change her protest sign to a " @entity39 " sign and hunkered down in @entity12 with a handful of résumés			2
" passers - by would say , ' get a job , ' and i did n't have a really good response to that , " @entity16 told @entity1			1
" i wanted to say , ' well , i 'm trying to get a job , ' but you know you ca n't really prove it			1
" so i said , why do n't i make a sign ( and prove ) that i am actively looking for a job ? " within two days , she said , someone spotted her			1
they exchanged e-mails , and an offer followed			0
that someone was a top executive at a @entity3 financial firm -- in other words , the enemy			1
" it might sound like it 's a fish - out - of - water story -- ( round ) peg in a square hole -- but it 's really not , " said @entity59 , a market analyst at @entity60			1
" she was standing there			0
she had her sign , she had her résumé , and i just passed by her and i chatted with her just for a brief few seconds			0
and she was obviously an intelligent person , " @entity69 said			0
" the résumé spoke for itself , it was very impressive , " he said			0
" so , i sent her an e-mail the next day and ... she responded almost immediately			0
" i asked her if she wanted to come in for an interview ; she said yes			0
i told her what i had in mind for her according to her skill set , and the rest is just history			0
" for now , @entity16 is researching early stage biotech companies for @entity60			1
she says she plans to take a test that would allow her to become a broker , and thus a full - fledged member of the 1 %			0
so what are her former @entity14 compatriots saying ? " i have been accused of being a traitor to both sides			2
some people are saying that the whole time i was at @entity14 i was really a @entity3 insider , " says @entity16			1
she said she plans on keeping her sign			0
she pledged to protest again when she finds something she feels is worth protesting .			0

@entity16 was fully *committed* to the @entity14 protests , she tells @entity1
the biochemist says she had been looking for work , but could n't prove it to *naysayers*
she showed up at @entity12 with her résumé , and soon had a job offer
she now researches biotech companies for @entity60 -- on @entity3
