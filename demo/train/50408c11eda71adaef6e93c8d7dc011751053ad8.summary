-- the @entity1 is urging @entity2 to look deeper into reports that thousands of people inside the country have been illegally detained or disappeared			1
a @entity1 delegation spent 10 days inside @entity2 at the invitation of the government , and interviewed families of the missing			1
the group issued a detailed report on their findings thursday			2
in many cases , the group found , families were often intimidated or threatened against reporting cases to authorities and were given empty promises that if they did n't , their loves ones would be returned to them			0
the @entity1 commission that receives reports of missing has more than 500 cases in its docket for all of @entity2			1
but that number , the working group notes , " may not be reflective of the reality of the situation			0
" " according to various official and unofficial sources met during the visit , it is in the post 9/11 period that the question of ' missing persons ' began to raise real attention at the national level , " the report says			2
" there is acknowledgment that enforced disappearances have occurred and still occur in the country			0
" " cases continue to be reported to the national authorities			0
but there are controversies both on the figures and on the nature of the practice of enforced disappearances			0
" @entity0 was unable to obtain comment thursday and friday from @entity2 government officials about the report			1
at least two high ranking @entity2 officials told @entity0 they were devoting attention to protests that have erupted in the country over an online @entity59 film			2
disappearances related to 9/11 the @entity1 group visited @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 and with families of those who are missing			1
" we call on the @entity69 to guarantee the safety of those who have met with us and protect them against any form of reprisals , threat or intimidation , " the group wrote			0
throughout their time in @entity2 , the group held numerous meetings with ngos , activists and lawyers as well as government representatives			2
it talked with people involved in diplomatic circles in @entity62 and heads of various @entity1 agencies			1
a number of cases of disappearances filed with the group allegedly occurred in 1985 and the beginning of the 1990s , in the country 's northwest region , the report says			2
the alleged disappearances appear to be related to conflicts in @entity96			0
and in the 1990s , the cases seem connected to the military operations carried out in @entity64 , specifically in the @entity100 province			0
in the 2000s , the working group started receiving information about people allegedly abducted " in the context of the so - called ' war on terror ' and sometimes said to have been transferred to other ( @entity2 ) territories or detention " centers , the report says			1
the working group heard a range of figures for how many may be missing -- between a hundred to thousands			0
found dead , tortured in the western province of @entity116 , sources told the group that more than 14,000 people are still missing			2
in @entity116 , since 2010 , people who were missing were discovered dead			2
their bodies had signs of torture , and due to decomposition their families did n't recognize them			0
the local government says only 100 are missing , the @entity1 group notes			1
the federal and local officials the group met with claimed the missing persons were not victims of forced disappearances , the report says			0
rather , the officials said those people had actually been under criminal charges and chosen to go into hiding			0
others , the @entity2 officials told the @entity1 group , fled to another country to join illegal armed organizations			1
another scenario presented to the @entity1 investigators was that the missing were abducted by groups not affiliated with @entity2			1
some people who have gone missing and turned up again have testified to being held in unofficial places of detention , the report says			1
many said they had been threatened not to speak about their detention			0
fitting a pattern the stories of families of the missing appear to fit a patten , according to the report : abductors appearing to be law enforcement and accompanied by what appear to be plain clothes intelligence agents , remove a person in front of witnesses			1
some families told @entity1 representatives they had tried to file a report with the police but were turned down or discouraged from doing so			1
many filed their cases with the @entity169 so that the @entity169 would issue an order to the police to initiate an investigation			0
in a " large number of cases , " the families would be threatened or intimidated against reporting			0
in a few cases , the @entity1 group reports , lawyers defending the families were reportedly victims of enforced disappearances			1
the @entity1 group praised efforts by some @entity2 courts in which people were found and returned to their families but " in the greatest number of cases , " investigations went nowhere			1
even when there 's evidence , the report says , perpetrators are often not prosecuted .			0

a @entity1 delegation went to @entity2 to investigate reports of missing people
