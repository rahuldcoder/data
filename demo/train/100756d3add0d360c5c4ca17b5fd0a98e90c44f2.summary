-- dressed in eye - catching red costumes , a high - spirited troupe of barefoot acrobats storms across a dusty yard in the heart of @entity6 , @entity7 's capital , their grinning faces painted with bright colors			1
using an elaborate mix of flips , kicks and twists , the skilful performers sing and whistle as they dance their way onto a makeshift stage , while the pounding beats of skin drums and cheerful clapping summon scores of excited children from nearby neighborhoods towards the spectacle			2
they 're all part of the @entity26 , an uplifting project that 's aiming to transform the lives of street children and orphans in @entity7 by using performing arts as a way of engaging youths who have suffered through poverty , drug use or other traumatic issues			1

organizers say they are all designed to help children express themselves , gain valuable information and ultimately prevent them from living on the streets			2
" we engage the children with arts and theater to encourage their creativity and stimulate their curiosity , " says @entity55 , who founded @entity56 in 2006			1
" we help holistically to their development and we see our interventions as crucial to any child 's development -- as important as schooling , as accommodation or food			2
" accidental beginnings back in the mid- 2000s , @entity55 , a young artist hailing from the north of @entity71 , left @entity72 to pursue his dream of taking a one - man street show to @entity75			1
he embarked on his mission in @entity75 , where he spent six months before heading north			0
but one month into his stay in @entity78 he was mugged and without most of his belongings , @entity55 had to get to the nearest @entity71 embassy , which was in @entity6			0
and that 's when everything changed			2
" when i got here i had nothing planned , but i happened to come across a guy who was working with street kids in a center called @entity87 in @entity6 , " recalls @entity55			1
" so i came to do some workshops with these kids and it was absolutely incredible -- the energy , the passion , the enthusiasm and the talent that these kids had was just so infectious			1
" at the same time i met a group of older guys who used to stay on the streets and were living at the center , and were also artists			0
so we were interested in how we could collaborate and work with these children			0
so it started very modestly and organically with just a few workshops and blossomed from there			0
" read this : from the streets to break beats from those initial sessions , @entity26 has grown into a group working with thousands of children , typically aged from seven to 20 , in five cities across @entity7			1
the charity occupies its own office space , has a paid staff of more than a dozen people and receives funding from @entity119			0
the group 's members , many of whom used to live on the streets themselves , run a series of artistic modules focused on issues affecting vulnerable kids , from physical and emotional abuse to hiv / aids and other major problems			1
as part of their training , the children also have to work together to stage performances for their communities , using the skills and information they gained during the workshop sessions			2
" that 's when you can instil all the information and internalize it , " says @entity55			0
" and then it 's more lasting			0
" the group 's performances culminate in its annual @entity145 , a vibrant 10 - day event at the end of august where children from across @entity7 meet up to sing , dance and perform in front of enthusiastic onlookers			1
held in various locations in @entity6 , the popular get - together includes a colorful carnival procession as well as an array of performances and art exhibitions that give children a platform to showcase their talents while highlighting the dangers of life on the streets			1
' i thought that 's the end of my life ' in @entity7 , loss of parents , poverty and family breakdown have pushed thousands of children onto the streets			1
according to @entity119 data , there are 1.2 million orphans under the age of 15 in the country , 800,000 of whom are affected by @entity178 and @entity179			0
in many cases , children take to the streets to try to earn money for school fees or supplement their family income			0
exposed to cruel living conditions , many start begging and stealing while others resort to drug use			0
" once you get sucked into that life , it is quite hard to disengage yourself , " says @entity55			0
" once you 're full time in the street , you 're open to a whole world of abuse -- sexual , physical , psychological , " he adds			0
" it 's survival ; it 's really going from day to day trying to get food , trying to get enough money for drugs			2
" read this : bamboo bikes put @entity7 business on right track as former street children themselves , many of @entity26 's performers are well aware of the neglect and abuse suffered by many of their beneficiaries			1
" i was born in a family of five , of which i was the last born , " says @entity26 facilitator @entity215 , one of the group 's success stories			1
" my mother died when i was three months old so my dad had to marry another wife , which became my step mother			0
" @entity225 's step mother disowned him when he was only eight , forcing him to run away to @entity6 and fend for himself			0
" i got stranded , i never knew where to start from , " says @entity225 , whose drumming now accompanies the group 's energetic performances			1
" i was left alone , i never knew anyone -- i just felt so lost , i thought that 's the end of my life			0
" it all changed when @entity225 was 14 and saw the @entity26 crew for the first time			2
" they were just making different scowls , and they just have different energies and their stories , " he remembers			0
" they were advocating for children that live on the street			2
it gave me confidence so i can stand			0
" ' life - changing effects of art ' for most children living on the streets , entertainment is a rarity			1
that 's why the @entity26 troupe regularly pops up unannounced in low - income areas , attracting at - risk youth with their dancing , singing and drumming			1
the performers say the troupe sees itself as a conduit for providing help			0
any child in need can be connected with other ngos or local professionals able to provide care			0
the genius is that none of the group 's activities looks like serious work so children are more likely to play along without realizing they are being offered help			1
looking ahead , @entity55 says the group 's dream is to turn its festival into a global hub where youth can come to perform and collaborate with @entity7 artists , as well as share skills and experiences about issues affecting children in different parts of the world			1
" we want our festival in the heart of @entity75 to be a hub for other young advocates and artists across the world who can come here and see whether they can be inspired by the life - changing effects of art in our country , " says @entity55 .			2
