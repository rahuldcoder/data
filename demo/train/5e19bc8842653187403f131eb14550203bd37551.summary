@entity0 , @entity1 -- paving slabs that convert energy from people 's footsteps into electricity are set to help power @entity9 's largest urban mall , at the @entity12 site			1
the recycled rubber " @entity15 " paving slabs harvest kinetic energy from the impact of people stepping on them and instantly deliver tiny bursts of electricity to nearby appliances			1
the slabs can also store energy for up to three days in an on - board battery , according to its creator			1
in their first commercial application , 20 tiles will be scattered along the central crossing between @entity0 's @entity29 and the recently opened @entity31 mall -- which expects an estimated 30 million customers in its first year			1
" that should be enough feet to power about half its ( the mall 's ) outdoor lighting needs , " said @entity33 , a 25 - year - old engineering graduate who developed the prototype during his final year of university in 2009			1
the green slabs are designed to compress five millimeters when someone steps on them , but @entity15 will not share the precise mechanism responsible for converting absorbed kinetic energy into electricity			2
although each step produces only enough electricity to keep an led - powered street lamp lit for 30 seconds , @entity33 says that the tiles are a real - world " crowdsourcing " application , harnessing small contributions from a large number of individuals			2
" we recently came back from a big outdoor festival where we got over 250,000 footsteps -- that was enough to charge 10,000 mobile phones , " said @entity33			2
the young inventor envisages @entity15 systems being used to power off - grid appliances such as public lighting , illuminated street maps and advertising , and to be installed in areas of dense human traffic such as city centers , underground stations and school corridors			1
" our main test installation is at a school in @entity72 ( southeast @entity1 ) -- where 1,100 kids have devoted their lives to stamping all over them for the last eight months , " said @entity33			0
in its current form , the @entity15 paving slab contains a low - energy led which lights up , expressing the energy transfer idea to the user but only consuming around 5 % of the energy from each footstep			1
" this is what i really enjoy about the design , " said @entity81 , head of sustainability at the @entity85 's government - funded @entity83			0
" as much as it 's an effective , common - sense source of some sustainable electricity , it 's also a great way for people to engage with the issue of sustainability ... to feel like they are part of the solution in a very immediate , fun and visual way that does n't make you do anything you would n't already be doing , " said @entity81			1
however , although generally enthusiastic about the product , for the time being @entity81 withholds speculation about its far - reaching impact			0
" as with all things of this nature , on a large scale and in the long term , its success will be determined by how cost - effective it is to produce ... if it turns out to be expensive , then it will struggle to find a place as anything more than a niche application , " he said			0
@entity33 declines to comment on the cost of each slab , arguing that their current price is much higher than what it will be when they go into mass production			0
that said , the company has already won a spate of awards , including the @entity129 category at the @entity85 's @entity130 and the @entity131			0
@entity15 has also recently received a round of financing from a group of @entity0 - based angel investors , although the sum is undisclosed			2
@entity33 is confident that the slab is durable			0
over the course of a month it was subjected to a machine that replicates the pounding of footsteps , non-stop every day , he added			0
" it 's also really easy to install as a retrofit on existing pavements , because they can be made to match their exact dimensions ... you just replace one slab with another , " he said			0
looking to the future , @entity33 would like to see the paving system introduced to the developing world , in areas that have a high footfall , but are off - grid , such as the slums in @entity159			1
" the average person takes 150 million steps in their lifetime , just imagine the potential , " he said .			0

engineer has developed paving slab that *transforms* energy from footsteps into electricity
first commercial order expected to power half of outdoor lighting at vast @entity0 *shopping* mall
sustainability expert says slabs *encourage* sense of *collective* *participation*
hopes one day to export across developing world to *provide* source of " off - grid " energy
