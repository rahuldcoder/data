the world 's eyes may have been focused on the breathtakingly fast political changes unfolding in @entity4 's capital @entity5 this week , but it is the @entity7 peninsula , where dozens of gunmen raised the @entity10 flag over parliament thursday , that should now be the primary source of concern for @entity4 's fledgling government and world leaders			1
@entity7 is an autonomous republic whose history has long been marred by political tension			0
gifted to @entity4 by @entity23 leader @entity22 in 1954 , its population is ethnic @entity10 by just over half and @entity4 by a quarter , while more than ten percent are @entity25 who are fiercely anti-russian as a result of @entity29 's repression of the group a half century ago			2
@entity10 's strategically important @entity32 naval fleet is hosted at @entity33 , the region 's largest city , an arrangement that controversially extended until 2042 by the ousted @entity4 president @entity36 , who was last seen fleeing @entity5			1
the large @entity10 population of @entity7 has long viewed the central government of @entity4 with suspicion			1
in recent days the mood has turned into aggressive hostility towards the new authorities in @entity5			2
@entity7 @entity10 see the newly - powerful opposition movement as illegitimate , sponsored by the @entity45 , and even fascist			2
anti-ukrainian protests are being held , @entity10 vigilante groups have sprung up across @entity7 , @entity10 flags have been hoisted on government buildings , clashes have broken out between @entity10 separatists and loyalist tatars and @entity4 , and the @entity10 military has been seen patrolling key buildings and infrastructure			1
the @entity10 has done precious little to contain this dangerous dynamic			0
on the contrary , its state - sponsored media have covered the unrest in @entity7 extensively and reiterated the @entity62 's view of the events in @entity5 as a coup d'Ã©tat			1
envoys from @entity66 have descended on @entity7 to promise @entity10 citizenship to all who want it and even the region 's re-integration into @entity10 proper			1
meanwhile , @entity10 's foreign ministry is warning of violations of the human rights of ethnic @entity10 in @entity4 , while the @entity10 military is reportedly preparing lists for the evacuation of the families of seamen serving at @entity33			2
snap military exercises have been ordered by @entity10 president @entity81 close to @entity4 's borders			1
in short , the @entity62 is stoking the fires of the building separatism that can be observed in @entity7 , despite its official commitment to non-interference and the territorial integrity of @entity4			1
this situation bears all the hallmarks of several long - standing , often referred to as " frozen " , conflicts in @entity91			0
in @entity92 , a breakaway region of @entity93 , in @entity94 , which is contested by @entity95 and @entity96 , or in @entity97 and @entity98 , which have seceded from @entity99 , @entity10 has long propped up separatists , providing political backing , military support , funding and passports			0
this undermines the stability of its smaller neighbors , challenges those nations ' sovereignty , blocks domestic reforms , and impedes @entity113 integration			0
by underwriting @entity7 separatism , @entity10 is taking the first steps toward repeating such a scenario in @entity4			1
so while many in @entity5 and in @entity45 capitals are pondering what @entity10 will do next , the the @entity62 has already made its decision			0
@entity10 's choice of tactics is no coincidence			0
rather , it is based on a sober analysis of the @entity127 situation in @entity4 , particularly @entity5 , and of @entity10 's limited leverage there			1
the hoped - for public mayhem and political stalemate have not materialized			0
western acceptance of the new government thwarts @entity10 claims of its illegitimacy			0
the country 's industrial east shows little inclination to move closer to @entity10 , and @entity45 financial aid is shaping up to reduce @entity4 's dependency on money from @entity66			1
in this constellation , @entity7 is the " weakest link " in @entity4 today			2
this leaves the new @entity4 government with a very difficult choice			0
it is obliged by the constitution to defend the territorial integrity of @entity4 , to re-establish public order in @entity7 , and to guarantee the safety of its citizens there , irrespective of their ethnic background			2
however , the central government is only just regaining control over the situation , and faces enormous political , economic and social challenges			0
its resources are already stretched without having to deal with a strong separatist movement and its even stronger external backer			0
what is more , @entity91 and the @entity162 will be of very limited help in confronting @entity7 separatists and their @entity10 masters			0
@entity4 's choice , then , is between consolidating the gains of the @entity169 across most of the country , and risking it all to maintain control over a historically reticent part of @entity4 that may already be lost			1
the question that has to be answered now is whether @entity7 is a price worth paying for getting @entity4 on track for democracy and @entity113 integration			1
@entity178 : how @entity4 is divided			0

armed men seize parliament building in @entity4 's @entity7 region
@entity7 is last big *bastion* of opposition to new government in @entity5 following president 's ouster
tensions have *simmered* since president @entity36 's *overthrow* last week
@entity194 : @entity4 must decide if it 's worth risking recent progress over restive @entity7
