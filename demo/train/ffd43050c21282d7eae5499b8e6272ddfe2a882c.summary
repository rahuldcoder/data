@entity0 is no longer inside the hospital where doctors declared her brain - dead after tonsil surgery last month			1
but family members wo n't reveal where they took the 13 - year - old after @entity8 released her sunday night			1
" we 're very relieved that she got safely to where she needed to be , because we were all very afraid , given the fragile condition as she wasted away at @entity14 , that she might not make it , " attorney @entity9 told reporters monday			1
the move ends one chapter of a weeks - long struggle between the hospital , which sought to remove @entity0 from a ventilator after doctors and a judge concluded she was brain - dead , and her relatives , who fought in court to keep her on the ventilator and contended she showed signs of life			1
why brain dead means really dead " as a family , we are definitely relieved that she 's no longer at @entity8 , but we 're all emotionally drained , " @entity30 , the girl 's uncle , told @entity33 's @entity32 on monday night			1
" this has been an incredible roller - coaster ride of emotions			2
" he said so long as his niece 's heart is beating , @entity0 is alive			1
" she 's moving a lot more			0
she responds to audio and touch , and more compelling evidence is the fact that she can move her head and neck , " @entity30 said			0
the hospital released @entity0 on sunday to the @entity49 coroner , who then released her to her mother 's custody , said dr. @entity52 , the hospital 's chief of pediatrics			1
the hospital had previously said it needed the coroner 's consent for the transfer because @entity0 was legally dead			1
@entity0 -- who was declared brain - dead december 12 after post-surgery complications that her family says included severe bleeding and cardiac arrest -- was moved from the hospital sunday accompanied by a critical - care team			1
she was attached to a ventilator , but with no feeding tube in place			2
on monday , @entity9 said @entity0 was being given antibiotics to fight infections and nutritional support			1
" they 're giving her everything that a person who would have a chance to live would be getting , " he said			2
he declined to provide details about the type of facility , citing privacy and security concerns			2
" she 's where she 's going to be for a while , " he said			0
" she needs to be medically stabilized , medically treated			0
" on sunday , the president of a rehabilitation center in @entity84 told @entity33 that the facility would gladly accept @entity0			1
but @entity9 said the family has no plans to give more details about her location			2
" we 've had people make threats from around the country			0
it 's sad that people act that way , " @entity9 said			0
" so for @entity0 's safety and those around her , we will not be saying where she went or where she is			1
" at least five different facilities that originally offered to care for @entity0 fell through , he said			1
but ultimately , the family chose from a number of offers			2
" there were other facilities that still had their hand extended , " he said			0
" but we took the first one that we knew would pull us in			0
" let parents decide if teen is dead the surgery @entity0 's case drew national attention and fueled debate as a fierce court battle unfolded between devastated family members fighting to keep her on a ventilator and doctors arguing she 'd already died			1
family members say the eighth - grader was alert and talking after doctors removed her tonsils , adenoids and extra sinus tissue in a surgery at the @entity129 hospital on december 9			1
doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea , a condition which made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems			2
before the surgery , @entity0 said she was worried that she would never wake up , according to her uncle			1
she seemed fine after the surgery , but asked for a popsicle because her throat hurt			0
not long afterward , something went terribly wrong			0
in an intensive care unit , the girl began bleeding profusely , the family said			0
according to family members , @entity0 went into cardiac arrest			1
days later , she was declared brain - dead			1
hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case			0
the court battle and the medical debate the family and the hospital disagreed over whether to disconnect her from a ventilator , and the issue wound up in @entity157			1
in court documents and public comments , the hospital maintained that there 's no doubt that @entity0 is brain - dead , describing the condition as irreversible			1
" no amount of prayer , no amount of hope , no amount of any type of medical procedure will bring her back , " @entity165 spokesman @entity164 said last month			0
" the medical situation here in this case is that @entity0 died several weeks ago			2
" a judge on december 23 appointed dr. @entity175 , chief of pediatric neurology at @entity177 , to evaluate @entity0			2
@entity175 concluded the next day that she met the criteria for brain death			0
according to a court filing , @entity175 found that the girl 's pupils were fully dilated and unresponsive to light and that she did not respond to a variety of intense stimuli			0
his report also says @entity0 showed no sign of breathing on her own when a ventilator was removed : " @entity189 failed apnea test			1
" the report says her heart was beating only because of the mechanical ventilator			0
in addition , an imaging test showed no blood flow to @entity0 's brain , while another showed no sign of electrical activity			1
@entity175 's conclusion : " overall , unfortunate circumstances in 13 - year - old with known , irreversible brain injury and now complete absence of cerebral function and complete absence of brainstem function , child meets all criteria for brain death , by professional societies and state of @entity214			2
" after seeing @entity175 's report , @entity157 judge @entity215 concluded on december 24 that @entity0 was brain dead			1
but @entity215 twice ruled that the hospital had to hold off on disconnecting @entity0 from life support , ultimately giving the family and the facility until january 7 to come to a resolution			1
the @entity49 coroner issued a death certificate for @entity0 on friday , listing december 12 as the date of death			2
the certificate still needed to be accepted by the health department to become official			0
medical ethicists , meanwhile , say the high - profile case fuels a misperception : that " brain death " is somehow not as final as cardiac death , even though , by definition , it is			2
the case is " giving the impression that dead people can come back to life , " @entity238 , director of the @entity239 at @entity240 , told @entity33 last month			0
family members say they 've seen reason for hope @entity0 's family members maintain that they 're hoping for a miracle			1
her mother told @entity33 last month that she 'd seen improvements , including indications from a hospital monitor that she said suggest her daughter was trying to breathe on her own			0
the girl 's uncle , @entity30 , told reporters last week that a pediatrician has seen @entity0 and has sworn she is not dead			1
@entity259 girl , 3 , dies after dental procedure when asked about the girl 's possible movement , @entity164 , the hospital spokesman , said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes , citing privacy laws			0
however , @entity164 said it is " quite common " for the muscles of brain dead patients to move , stressing it 's " not a sign of life			2
" so far the family has raised more than $ 50,000 on @entity273 to move her			0
according to the site , more than 1,300 people have donated money in 10 days			0
" we 're very grateful , very proud , " said @entity30			0
" we want to thank everyone that supported us , everyone that stood in our corner , everyone that prayed for us , everyone that helped donate to make this possible			0
without you guys , none of this would be possible			0
" he did n't rule out the possibility that the family could eventually file a lawsuit against the hospital			2
but he dismissed concerns that details about what happened during and after @entity0 's surgery could be lost if she remains on a ventilator			1
" that 's pretty much saying that she 's evidence and she 's a body , and we do n't look at it that way , " @entity30 said			0
" we 're not worried about accountability			0
we 're worried about survival			0
" in releasing @entity0 , the hospital said : " our hearts go out to the family as they grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace			1
" when routine surgeries go wrong			0
