@entity1 , @entity0 -- it would be wonderful to say that in 2013 things were looking up for women in @entity6 -- both onscreen and behind the scenes -- but the sad news is that the numbers have remained consistently dismal for the last decade			1
in 2012 , in the @entity11 , women made up 18 % of the directors , executive producers , producers , writers , cinematographers , and editors working on the top 250 domestic grossing films			1
and women directors accounted for just 9 %			1
it 's clear that @entity6 has a woman problem			1
it 's not just that they do n't trust the vision of a woman to direct ; they do n't trust that people want to see our stories			1
there 's a prevailing sense that male stories are universal , for everyone , and that women 's stories are just for women			1
just look around at your local movie theater and you will see that the male action superhero films have become the dominant narratives of our time			0
just this summer , we have already seen the release of the latest versions of " @entity46 " , " @entity47 " , " @entity48 " , " @entity49 " , and still to come are " @entity50 " , " @entity51 " , " @entity52 " , " @entity53 " among many , many others			0
the message is loud and clear -- these are the movies that matter -- not only to @entity6 , but , increasingly to the world , as the international box office now accounts for almost 70 % of the grosses of these films			1
and none of the films above are directed by women			2
the reality that female directors and producers and writers deal with is the ongoing perception that women will go see movies about men and that men wo n't go see stories about women			1
the success of " bridesmaids " in 2011 helped diminish the case slightly , as did " @entity79 " in 2012			2
but even though women buy half the movie tickets , this perception persists especially for those who want to tell women 's stories			1
another problem is that because there are so few movies about women , the ones that are released are held up to absurd scrutiny			1
if you fail the entire gender is blamed and we take two steps back , but on the other hand , if you are a success you ca n't get a sequel made because women 's successes are still seen as flukes			1
we are stuck in a catch 22			0
it is worth noting that this summer in the sea of superhero films , there are only two films with women leads being distributed by the major studios			2
" @entity111 " is an original comedy , written by a woman @entity108 and directed by @entity109 , the director of " bridesmaids "			0
it stars @entity113 and @entity114 both at the top of their game in a genuinely hysterical film			0
" @entity119 : the @entity124 " is the latest attempt to build off the success of the " @entity123 " franchise			0
while neither of the movies being released by the studios is directed by a woman , there are a handful of women directed films you can see this summer , at least here in the @entity11			2
we have films from @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
the problem is that all of these films are small , do n't have superheroes flying or cities blowing up			2
these films will be available on a limited amount of screens , so you need to live in place that has more than just a local multiplex or else you will easily miss these films and your entire summer can go by without seeing a single film by a female director			2
but even though the statistics are still dismal , there are women breaking through all across @entity6			1
the reality is that there are women decision makers at all levels in the business			2
@entity170 has been successful as the head of @entity172 for several years			0
and just last week a new three person team was named to run @entity174 and it includes a woman -- @entity176			0
and let 's not forget @entity178 who broke through and became the first female to win an @entity180 for best director			1
she can make any movie she wants at any studio			0
but she chose to make her last film " @entity185 " with an independent producer @entity186 , who has made quite a name for herself over the last couple of years			0
and while there are still not enough women directed films at the top tier festivals , this year for the first time at the @entity191 there was parity in both the @entity11 documentary and feature competitions			0
but we need more women and more female role models as directors because movies have such power in our culture			1
they are a reflection of who we are and what we value			0
they are what we talk about at work on monday morning			0
they are how we socialize			0
when we do n't see women , and we do n't see women 's stories , we get the message that women do n't matter as much , that our stories do n't count , that our experiences are less valid			1
and that 's something that is just not acceptable .			0
