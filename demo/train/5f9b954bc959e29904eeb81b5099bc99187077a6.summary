-- i never thought my @entity3 translator would save my life by killing two @entity6 fighters who were about to kill me			1
i 'm here today because he had my back in a way i only thought an @entity13 soldier would			2
on april 28 , 2008 , i found myself in the worst ambush of my life -- surrounded by 45 @entity6 fighters , out of grenades , and running low on bullets			1
we had been fighting nonstop for an hour			0
a mortar round landed within a few meters of my position and sent me flying into a ditch			0
coming into to consciousness i realized i would likely die on that desolate @entity3 hillside -- the mortars were too close and accurate to miss me again			2
at that moment , i felt a body slam into the ditch next to me and simultaneously heard the unmistakable sound of an @entity28 firing next to my head			0
i turned and saw my @entity3 interpreter @entity30 glaring down the barrel of his rifle at the bodies of the two @entity6 fighters he had just killed			1
they had me dead to rights until @entity7 acted to save mine			0
on that april day he taught me the true price of loyalty and brotherhood forged through combat			0
the @entity6 retaliated by placing him on the top of its kill list			1
for the next five years , we tried to secure him and his family the @entity13 visas he clearly had earned			1
after an extensive effort that involved a national media campaign , the legal and political guidance of the @entity54 and the @entity55 , working with more than a dozen members of @entity57 , we eventually prevailed			0
he now lives in @entity59 with his family			0
together , we run @entity60 , an organization dedicated to ensuring we fulfill our nation 's promise to bring these allies to @entity13 after their service and provide them with housing , furniture , and employment assistance			1
we consider keeping that promise a matter of national security -- nothing less than the credibility and honor of the @entity13 is at stake			2
wars have consequences , many unforeseen			0
one of the most profound and seldom - discussed consequence is what happens to our @entity82 and @entity3 allies			1
the majority of the @entity82 and @entity3 people did not seek these wars -- they were at best begrudging participants hopeful that our promise of a better life came to pass			1
moreover , most of these people did not pick up arms and fight us -- indeed , the bulk of the fighting in both wars has always been confined to limited segments of the population			0
most important , many of these people chose to fight with us because we implored them to -- and now they are going to die because we failed to truly defeat our common enemies and we 're apparently comfortable with abandoning our allies as we retreat			1
a common truth among @entity13 military veterans of the @entity101 and @entity3 wars ( especially those of us who served on the front lines ) is that our interpreters most likely saw more and worse combat than the majority of us			1
as a result , we tend to view our " terps " as full and equal combat veterans			0
they may have not been full soldiers , but they wore our uniforms , ate our food , bled our blood , saved our lives countless times , and fought and killed our enemies			0
when we left , they remained behind to join our replacements for yet another tour			0
and we told them we would give them all @entity13 visas if , after at least a year 's worth of faithful and honorable service , they found themselves under duress			1
almost all interpreters face some threat -- being a collaborator also has consequences			0
but many end up on the @entity6 or @entity135 's hit lists			1
and that 's where we ca n't understand our government 's treatment of these fellow veterans			0
if they were @entity13 citizens , we 'd spare no expense protecting them and helping them flee to the safety of @entity13 soil			2
but , because they were born @entity3 or @entity82 , they 're somehow subject to a lower standard of treatment			2
the truth is , these translators did a lot more than most @entity13 to protect and defend our country			2
they have earned their place in @entity13			2
sadly , the bureaucrats in @entity59 do not feel as strongly about saving these allies as the veterans who actually fought these wars			0
sometime in this week or the next , the @entity159 will run out of visas it can issue to @entity3			1
to its credit , the @entity159 has pleaded with @entity57 to pass the @entity163 of 2014 , which would renew the @entity165 program for another year and add 6,000 new visas for eligible @entity3			1
the @entity159 estimates that it has a backlog of 6,000 @entity3 applicants			2
if @entity57 fails to pass the law by september 30 , 2014 , the program will end and these applicants , many who have been waiting years for a ruling on their application , will likely never receive the visas they so bravely earned			1
we will simply abandon them to a gruesome and torturous death at the hands of the @entity6			1
as an @entity13 soldier and a former @entity3 translator who lives in @entity13 and dreams of the day he becomes a citizen , the prospect of abandoning our allies and breaking our promise disgusts us			1
how many times in the last century have we vowed " never again " after profound human suffering ? we said it after we left @entity189 in 1975			0
and again as we watched from the sidelines in horror at @entity192 in 1994			0
i fear we may be already saying it in @entity101			0
the coming tragedy in @entity3 is entirely preventable			2
we have n't yet abandoned our closest @entity3 allies to @entity6 slaughter			1
all we have to do is have the courage to act -- if we do n't soon , we 'll once more absently vow " never again			0

@entity201 's @entity3 translator saved his life by killing two @entity6 fighters
*writers* : @entity6 put translator on top of its kill list : took five years to get him and family to @entity13
@entity13 has visa program to get interpreters to @entity13 , but visas running out
they say @entity13 is abandoning allies to death as we retreat : we need to expand visa program
