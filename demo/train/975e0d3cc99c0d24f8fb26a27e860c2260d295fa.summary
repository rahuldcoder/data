-- no more will soldiers ' vision be limited to the socket - embedded spheres that @entity4 intended			2
the @entity5 now wants troops to see dangers lurking behind them in real time , and be able to tell if an object a kilometer away is a walking stick or an @entity11			1
in a solicitation released today , @entity12 , the @entity5 's far - out research branch , unveiled the @entity15 via @entity17 effort , or @entity18			1
imagine a suite of cameras that digitally capture a kilometer - wide , 360 - degree sphere , representing the image in @entity23 onto a wearable eyepiece			1
you 'd be able to literally see all around you , including behind yourself , and zooming in at will , creating a " stereoscopic / binocular system , simultaneously providing 10x zoom to both eyes			1
" and you would do this all hands - free , apparently by barking out or pre-programming a command ( the solicitation leaves it up to a designer 's imagination ) to adjust focus			1
then comes the terminator - vision			2
@entity12 wants the eyepiece to include " high - resolution computer - enhanced imagery as well as task - specific non-image data products such as mission data overlays , threat warnings / alerts , targeting assistance , etc. " @entity46 identified : @entity47 ... the " @entity49 " tool will provide soldiers with " muzzle flash detection , " " projectile tracking " and " object recognition / labeling , " basically pointing key information out to them			1
and an " integrated weapon sighting " function locks your gun on your target when acquired			1
that 's far beyond an app mounted on your rifle that keeps track of where your friendlies and enemies are			2
the imaging would n't just be limited to what any individual soldier sees			0
@entity18 envisions a " networked optical sensing capability " that fuses images taken from nodes worn by " collections of soldiers and / or unmanned vehicles			0
" the @entity76 drone overhead ? its full - motion video and still images would be sent into your eyepiece			2
it also has to be ridiculously lightweight , weighing less than 700 grams for the entire system -- including a battery powerful enough to " exceed 24 hours [ usage ] under normal conditions			1
" that 's about a pound and a half , maximum			2
the @entity91 's experimental ensemble of wearable gadgets weighs about eight pounds			2
and it is to @entity18 what your @entity94 is to the @entity97			0
here 's how far advanced @entity18 is compared to bleeding - edge imaging and networking capabilities that the @entity91 is currently developing			1
right now , the @entity91 's asking three different companies -- @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 -- to build a wearable platform of digital maps , computers and radios , networked with one another			2
soldiers would have warzone maps beamed onto helmet - mounted eyepieces			0
the system , known as @entity113 , needs to weigh less than eight pounds , and it builds on a years - long and ultimately fruitless effort called @entity115			1
( one of the problems with @entity115 is it was heavy and cumbersome , owing in part to battery weight			0
) the @entity91 hopes to choose one of the @entity122			0
by the time it 'll actually roll out @entity113 after testing , production and deployment -- a few years , optimistically -- @entity18 will already be hard at work on its replacement			0
@entity12 wants a hands - free zooming function within two years of work on the contract			1
by year three , the computer - enhanced vision tool needs to be ready			0
year four is for 360 - degree vision			0
then it 's on to development			0
the @entity91 is generally hot for combat - ready smartphones to keep soldiers linked up with each other			0
and the buzz - generating tool for the soldier of the near future is mapping technology , delivered onto a smartphone or some other handheld mobile device , at least judging from this year 's @entity91 confab			1
but all of these representation tools are two - dimensional , and require soldiers to look away from their patrols in order to use them			0
@entity153 's @entity152 , for instance , lets soldiers see icons on a tablet - mounted map telling them where their friends , enemies and neutrals are			1
it ca n't put those icons onto a @entity23 picture sent to a soldier 's eyes , let alone allow a 10x zoom for a kilo - wide 360 - degree field of vision			1
why would anyone use a map on a smartphone when they could have @entity18 ? even with all the advances in digital imaging , it 'll be a tall order to put together 360 - degree vision and 10x zoom and mapping software and integration with weapons systems and lightweight miniaturization and network connectivity			0
@entity12 does n't really address how the system 's networked optics would work in low - bandwidth areas like , say , eastern @entity187 ( though maybe drone - borne cell towers can help )			1
indeed , judging from the solicitation , while @entity18 is supposed to be networked , it does n't seem to have any communications requirements for soldiers to talk through what their optics are sharing with each other			0
maybe there 's a role for those new soldier smartphones after all			0
