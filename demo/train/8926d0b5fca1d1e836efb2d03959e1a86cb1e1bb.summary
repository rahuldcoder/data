-- " white people adopt black kids to make themselves feel good ... a black child needs black parents to raise it			1
" " maybe she adopted one because the blacks in the community would n't step forward and adopt ? " " what 's the big deal ? if no white person ever adopted a black child , they 'd be saying why do n't white people adopt black children			1
" " who cares what race they are ? a woman got a child , a child got a mother ... it 's beautiful ! ! ! and yes i am black ... if it matters			1
" these impassioned comments and thousands more poured in earlier this week when @entity0 published a story on the stirred - up debate surrounding @entity28 's recent adoption			1
a @entity30 cover photo of the actress beaming at her newly adopted black infant son , and the discussions that have followed , clearly hit a nerve			1
so when it comes to transracial adoptions in this country , where are we ? @entity40 is the white child of a black mother whose adoption sparked controversy and whose attitude forces people to think about the issue differently			1
@entity40 would n't change a thing about her life , which is saying a lot for a young woman who spent her early childhood being neglected and bounced through the foster - care system			1
that was before a drawn - out legal case ended in 1998 , allowing a single black woman , @entity55 -- the only mother @entity40 had ever loved -- to become her forever mom			1
the @entity58 lawsuit was filed when a county agency cited concerns about " cultural issues " in an attempt to keep the pair apart			0
@entity66 @entity65 's adoption of @entity40 's biracial half - sister had already been completed , without challenge , and @entity65 says she wanted to keep the girls together			2
( as a matter of full disclosure , this @entity0 writer 's late father represented @entity55 in the case			2
) at 21 , @entity40 is thriving in college , well on her way to becoming an early - childhood educator and seamlessly moving between worlds			0
in one day , she might braid the hair of black friends , address faculty at @entity82 where she is on a partial multicultural scholarship , and then go salsa dancing with her @entity86 sorority sisters			2
" people are sometimes startled			0
' she 's white , but she does n't seem white , ' " she says with a laugh			1
" i can relate to everyone			0
i like being exposed to everything			0
... seeing me , hearing me -- it does n't matter what color you 're raised just as long as someone loves you			2
" forty percent of children adopted domestically and internationally by @entity97 are a different race or culture from their adoptive parents , according to a 2007 @entity101 , the most recent study of its kind conducted by the @entity97 @entity104			1
legislation passed by @entity106 in 1994 and 1996 prohibits agencies getting federal help from discriminating against would - be parents based on race or national origin			1
how adoptive parents have approached transracial adoptions has changed with time , says @entity114 , acting chief executive of the @entity115			1
" in the old days , meaning the ' 70s and ' 80s , there was this notion that these parents need to be colorblind			2
this sounds wonderful , but by being colorblind you 're denying they 're of a different race and culture , " @entity114 says			2
" families that are successful are those that acknowledge race			2
... it 's not a curse			0
it 's not an impossible feat. they just need to work harder to give a child a sense of self - identity			2
" it may be ideal and less complicated to match children available for adoption with same - race , same - culture families , says @entity114 , who advocates that children be raised in their own countries whenever possible , too			1
" but timeliness is of the utmost importance , " he says			0
" it 's better to find permanency and a loving home			0
" the latest figures show that there are 463,000 @entity97 kids in the foster - care system , of which 123,000 are available for adoption , @entity114 says			1
of those , he says , 30 percent are black , 39 percent are white , 21 percent are @entity155 and the rest are of other origins			1
seventy - three percent of official adoptions -- including those arranged through foster care , private domestic arrangements and internationally -- are done by whites , according to the 2007 survey of adoptive parents			1
but that does n't account for informal arrangements , when relatives take in other family members ' children , which is much more common in the black community , says @entity172 , vice-president elect of the @entity173 of @entity174			1
she says the black community takes in " more children than the whole foster care system does , " although @entity114 adds that often these arrangements do n't have the safeguards and protections legal adoptions provide			1
when handled well , transracial adoption is " a very positive thing , " says @entity183 , who has been studying these adoptions for 30 years and has written 65 books , including " @entity186 : from @entity187 to @entity188			1
" " but love is not enough , " said @entity189 , a professor of justice and public policy at @entity192 in @entity193			0
" you really have to make some changes in your life if you adopt a child of another race			1
" in the case of a white parent adopting a black child , that might mean living in an integrated neighborhood , having pictures in the home of black heroes , seeking out other families in similar situations , attending a black church and finding role models or godparents who are black			1
the same need to integrate a child 's culture applies across the board , whether parents are adopting from @entity218 , @entity219 or elsewhere			2
" it helps make our society more integrated , " said @entity189 , who has five biracial grandchildren			2
" race becomes less important and other kinds of identity issues become more important			1
" @entity227 and his wife , @entity228 , adopted two boys as newborns			2
@entity231 , 17 , is biracial and @entity232 , 15 , is black			2
race never mattered to the white couple when they set out to adopt , after it became clear they would n't be able to bear children on their own			1
" we simply wanted a healthy newborn , " @entity227 says			0
" we did n't care about race , did n't care about sex , and we knew we wanted them locally			1
" had the family uprooted to white suburbia , he suspects , the journey might have been more challenging			2
as it is , the kids go to public schools in @entity248 , @entity249 , live in a multiracial and multicultural environment and grew up in a house where pictures of @entity253 and @entity254 hung on the walls			0
but @entity227 says he and his wife did n't " go way overboard			0
" the white pair did n't , for example , suddenly start celebrating @entity259			1
" my wife is @entity261 , though not so practicing , and we did @entity263 and @entity264			0
double the presents -- they quickly celebrated that , " he says			0
" kids are always trying to figure out their identity and who they are , and race is just part of it			1
" that may be true , but the @entity173 of @entity174 has long argued for keeping black children in black homes			0
about 40 years ago , the association released a four - page position paper on transracial adoption in which it went so far as to call such adoptions " genocide " -- and that word choice has dogged the organization ever since			1
but @entity285 , the vice-president - elect , says when that position was written decades ago , blacks were being discounted as adoptive parents , not being given the same resources to help keep families together and thereby prevent the need for child placements , and that agencies were n't recruiting families within the community			1
by speaking strongly , the organization helped jolt the system -- although more still needs to be done , she says			0
the preference , @entity285 says , remains that kids be placed in same - race households whenever possible			2
and if it is n't possible , or if a birth parent selects an adoptive family of a different race , then those adopting must be educated to understand " the impact of race and racism on the country , their family and the child in particular , " she says			1
" there is a negative impact that children and families are going to experience based on race , " she says			0
" the idea that race does n't matter is not true			2
we would like it to be true , but it 's not			0
" @entity66 and @entity40 have faced challenges along the way			0
they 've received their share of stares and under - the - breath comments like , " what 's this world coming to			0
" when a young @entity40 once started climbing into the van to join her family at an @entity336 's restaurant , patrons came running to grab her , yelling that she was going into the wrong car			0
the girl was given detention at school , accused of lying because she called a young black boy her little brother , which he was			0
at a movie theater one time , someone called the police because they feared @entity40 had been abducted			0
@entity66 says she got attacks from both sides			0
" white babies were a precious commodity			0
' blacks ca n't take care of white children , ' " she remembers hearing			2
" and blacks were outraged " because there are so many black children in the system who need homes , and " they did n't understand why a black woman would n't adopt one of her own			1
" but she says she simply wanted to keep @entity364 and her half - sister in the same home and give them a loving family , together			0
@entity40 says that upbringing taught her to embrace all people			0
" it gave me so much opportunity to talk to so many different people			0
i stood up for a lot of things , and it made me break peoples ' mind - sets , " she says			0
" we 're accountable for each other as brothers and sisters			0
we need to look out for each other because at the end of the day we 're all human beings			0
