@entity0 -- the nation 's second largest city is preparing for potential traffic paralysis with the closure this weekend of a major highway that passes through the mountains of @entity0			1
last year 's closure of @entity9 -- described by local officials as " the nation 's busiest freeway " -- was expected to be so apocalyptic that car - loving @entity0 labeled the weekend shutdown " @entity14			1
" in fact , traffic flowed rather smoothly because many motorists stayed home , and the freeway through the @entity20 reopened ahead of schedule on that july 2011 weekend			0
this year 's construction effort is dubbed " @entity14 , " and officials are concerned again about ultra-gridlock out of a fear that motorists may take to the roads this weekend out of excessive confidence and complacency			1
motorists should avoid driving this weekend in affected areas , local officials said			2
" we do n't want people to become complacent based on the success of last year 's closure			1
once again , it 's vitally important that we all plan ahead , avoid the area , and eat , shop and play locally			0
otherwise , there will be problems , " said @entity37 , the @entity39 's director for @entity0 and @entity41 counties			2
@entity44 , @entity45 's executive director of transit project delivery , said : " the risk factors that caused transportation , law enforcement and emergency response agencies heartburn during last year 's i - 405 freeway closure have not changed			2
" @entity52 is still the nation 's busiest freeway , " he said			0
" the closure is still in the geographically constrained @entity20 , where there are no immediate or effective alternate routes			0
that 's why we still need the public 's full and complete cooperation if this second closure operation is going to be as successful as the first			0
" a 10 - mile section of @entity9 is scheduled to be closed from as early as 10 p.m. friday ( 1 a.m. et saturday ) until 5 a.m. ( 8 a.m. et ) monday			1
the 405 , as it 's locally called , cuts through the @entity65 and connects suburban @entity66 with @entity67 and the well - to - do neighborhoods of west @entity0 , such as @entity69 and @entity70			1
specifically , the 405 will be closed between @entity72 and @entity73 101			0
the highway construction project this weekend will complete a carpool lane system over the mountain pass to create a continuous carpool lane of almost 73 miles in each direction between @entity80 and @entity81 's @entity66 -- the longest in the world , officials said			1
highway reconstruction will continue until 2013 , when the overall $ 1.34 billion project is scheduled for completion , officials said			0
improvements include new bridges and ramps and building 18 miles of retaining and sound walls , officials said .			0

this weekend 's closure of @entity9 is dubbed " @entity14 '
the 405 is a critical artery that will be closed for 10 miles through mountains
@entity0 officials are asking motorists to stay off the road this weekend
the highway connects the @entity66 with west @entity0 and @entity67
