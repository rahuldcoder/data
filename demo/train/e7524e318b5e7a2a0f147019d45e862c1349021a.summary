-- @entity1 goes to the polls on saturday for a referendum on a new constitution that has divided the country in recent weeks , prompting mass demonstrations reminiscent of those that ousted former president @entity8			1
thousands of protesters , both for and against president @entity10 , have taken to the streets over the past three weeks , with tensions occasionally boiling over in violent clashes that have left at least seven people dead and hundreds injured			1
what 's behind the latest unrest ? the protests were sparked by a november 22 presidential decree issued by @entity10 -- the first freely elected leader of this country of 83 million -- which prevented any court from overturning his decisions until a new , @entity27 constitution was passed			1
the ruling has essentially given him unchecked power , protecting from judicial review any decisions he has made since assuming office			1
what was @entity10 's rationale ? insisting the order is temporary -- it will last only until a new constitution is put in place -- @entity10 claimed the move was intended to safeguard the revolution			1
he said the edict would only apply to " sovereign " matters			0
in particular , @entity10 said , the edict was aimed at preventing interference from the courts in the work of @entity1 's @entity49 , the body charged with drafting a new constitution			1
the judges , many of whom were holdover loyalists from the government of @entity8 , are widely viewed as hostile to the @entity55 who now dominate the assembly that has been charged with framing a new constitution			1
some had threatened to shut down the assembly			0
@entity10 's move , which has concentrated power in the hands of the executive , is a continuation of the power struggles between @entity10 's @entity64 -- the @entity66 movement that is @entity1 's most powerful political force and won nearly half the seats in parliamentary elections -- and the remnants of the military - dominated establishment of the @entity8 years			1
in june , just weeks before @entity10 's election , @entity1 's military leaders declared parliament invalid and dissolved the body , a ruling which was upheld by @entity1 's highest court in september			1
after his election , @entity10 defied the military leadership by calling parliament into session			2
@entity10 's edict ruled out the possibility of repeat interference			2
in august , the president moved decisively against the military leadership , sending into retirement @entity88 @entity87 -- who , as chairman of the @entity91 , had acted as the country 's de facto ruler in the wake of @entity8 's ouster and prior to @entity10 's election			1
what has been the response to the presidential decree ? @entity10 's decree has sharply divided @entity1			1
while the @entity64 is standing by their man , holding large rallies to show support , many other @entity1 have seen the order as an alarming and undemocratic power grab -- a lurch back towards an authoritarian style of leadership the country had only recently overthrown			2
left - leaning and liberal @entity1 -- who had played a large part in the revolution but were sidelined by the success of @entity55 in subsequent elections -- made up a large component of the protestors in @entity116			0
many of their chants accused @entity10 , the first democratically elected president , of becoming a " new pharaoh " and " dictator			2
" " in some ways , the liberal and left - wing forces are trying to stake a claim to the revolution again through the protests , " @entity123 , a reader in politics at the @entity126 's @entity125 , told @entity0			0
the demonstrators , who have been calling on @entity10 to resign , also included some of those sympathetic to the military and the old regime , she said			1
why has this come about now ? @entity10 issued his edict the day after the november 21 cease - fire between @entity138 and @entity139 , which he had played a central role in brokering			2
@entity123 said that , buoyed with new found political capital from his successful foray on the international stage , the @entity1 president may have miscalculated , underestimating the level of outrage his actions would provoke			2
the anger on the streets , she said , also reflected a level of public dissatisfaction with progress made since the revolution in addressing issues of poverty and inequality in a country with an unemployment rate of more than 12 % , a median age of about 24 years , and a per capita gdp of $ 6,500			0
" many of the original grievances behind the revolution were derived from questions around extreme inequality and corruption , " she said			0
" those issues have not been addressed			0
" the protests represented " a perfect storm of many grievances coming to the fore , " she said , and it was not clear how it would play out			0
" it 's a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the regime			0
" what else was in the declaration ? other aspects of @entity10 's edict are likely to prove popular with many of those who have taken to the streets against him			2
in his decree , @entity10 also announced that all deaths and violence connected to the uprising against @entity8 would be investigated again , with those responsible retried if necessary			1
this raised the possibility that @entity8 , currently serving a life prison term , could be re-prosecuted , along with a number of regime figures who were previously acquitted			2
some @entity1 have expressed disappointment that security forces and officials have escaped punishment over last year 's violent crackdown on protestors			0
@entity10 also sacked the prosecutor - general in his declaration , and extended the timeline for drafting the constitution by two months			2
but while those resolutions may be welcomed by many , the unilateral manner in which @entity10 has gone about expanding his powers has alarmed many			0
" it 's the way he 's doing it that has gotten people upset , because it reminds them of the way @entity8 used to govern , " @entity207 , a @entity208 expert at the @entity209 , told @entity0			2
one popular slogan during the current protests has been " @entity10 is @entity8			1
" if @entity10 's new powers are only temporary , why the outrage ? protesters claim he has used the edict to hijack the process in order to produce a document that reflects his @entity66 vision and consolidates his power in the new @entity1			1
@entity227 , left - wing and @entity229 members of the assembly boycotted the body over concerns that their views were not being given enough consideration by @entity55 -- with many of them subsequently replaced by @entity55			0
what is happening with the constitution now ? the @entity66 - dominated assembly has now passed a finalized 234 - article draft of the constitution , which is due to go for a public vote on saturday , december 15			0
but there has been sharp opposition to the document , with critics fearing it could lead to excessive restrictions , and claiming it offers inadequate protection of the rights of religious minorities and women			0
" ( @entity10 ) put to referendum a draft constitution that undermines basic freedoms & violates universal values , " wrote @entity253 , a @entity254 laureate and head of the liberal @entity256 , on his @entity258 account			1
" the struggle will continue			0
" @entity264 , deputy @entity208 and @entity266 director at @entity268 , said that " moving a flawed and contradictory draft to a vote is not the right way to guarantee fundamental rights or to promote respect for the rule of law			0
" the draft constitution maintains the principles of sharia as the main source of legislation -- a position unchanged from the constitution under @entity8			1
but @entity282 , a member of the @entity283 , said he fears the proposed constitution would open the way for a theocracy by moving the country even closer to codifying sharia law			0
what is the military 's position ? despite @entity10 's struggles with remnants of the old regime within the military establishment , the armed forces -- which ruled @entity1 for more than a year after the fall of @entity8 -- has largely stayed out of the stand - off			1
but on saturday , december 8 , it issued its first statement , urging the parties to enter into dialogue to resolve the crisis and vowing to protect public institutions and innocent people			0
" anything other than that will lead us into a dark tunnel with catastrophic consequences , which we will never allow to happen , " it warned			0
will the opposition participate in the referendum ? in an apparent attempt to defuse the crisis , @entity10 canceled most of his decree on sunday , december 9 , but vowed to press ahead with the referendum			2
the cancellation of the decree was not retroactive , which meant that any decisions he had made since its announcement still stood -- including the decision to approve the draft constitution			1
this led to speculation the opposition would boycott the vote			0
but leading opposition group the @entity327 -- a coalition formed of liberal and secular parties -- subsequently urged its supporters to participate if it was not successful in delaying the referendum by a month			0
the opposition @entity332 said its members would participate , but wanted assurances that the vote would be fair , while other parties , including the 6 april youth movement , which backed @entity10 in the june elections , have urged members to vote against the draft constitution .			1

five people have been killed as @entity1 protest a presidential edict and draft constitution
the decree gave president @entity10 unchecked power until a new constitution was in place
@entity10 has been *locked* in a power struggle with factions of the old regime
demonstrators accuse him of acting like autocratic former president @entity8
