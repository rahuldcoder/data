army sgt. @entity0 is on a flight from @entity2 and is scheduled to arrive in @entity3 , @entity4 , within hours			1
@entity0 had been in a military hospital in @entity6 , @entity7 , since he was released in @entity8 after five years of @entity10 captivity			1

@entity0 was exchanged on may 31 for five @entity10 figures detained at the @entity18 military prison at @entity32 , @entity33			1
the swap sparked a controversy that touches on a range of volatile issues -- ending the @entity8 war , releasing @entity32 detainees , accusations by members of @entity0 's unit that he deserted -- and it comes in an election year that has further widened the partisan divide in @entity47			1
defense secretary @entity48 has defended the deal , saying it was @entity0 's last and best chance to get out			1
critics have said the cost of the swap was too high , and that @entity54 should have been notified in advance			0
slow recovery @entity0 is " continuing to improve every day , " @entity15 spokesman col. @entity57 said this week			2
the solider had not spoken with his family			0

an @entity73 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report			0
the @entity73 has no definitive finding that @entity0 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity18 military official told @entity27			1
as @entity0 recovers , details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity			1
citing an @entity18 official , the @entity88 has reported that @entity0 told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage			2
@entity27 has reported that @entity0 has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape , according to a senior @entity18 official , who spoke on the condition of not being identified			2
the official also told @entity27 that @entity0 suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse			2
in his own words the exact conditions of his captivity are not known , and @entity0 has not spoken publicly since his release			1

the website obtained the letters by " sources in contact with the @entity10			1
" it confirmed their authenticity with @entity18 and @entity115 officials			0

" i am given food and drink			0
" @entity0 had harsh words for @entity73 leadership			2
" @entity126 was lacking , if not non-existent			0
the conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly ( sic ) the ones risking thier ( sic ) lives from attack , " he wrote			0
" if this letter makes it to the @entity18 , tell those involved in the investigation that there are more sides to the cittuwation ( sic ) , " @entity0 said			2
" please tell @entity47 to wait for all evadince ( sic ) to come in			0
" @entity142 on @entity0 deal @entity142 appeared wednesday at a @entity145 hearing to defend the swap , where rep. @entity147 , @entity148 , appeared to strike a nerve when he pressed the defense chief on why it was taking the @entity18 military so long to interview @entity0			1
@entity142 already had fielded lawmakers ' accusations that the @entity155 overstepped presidential authority and negotiated with terrorists to gain @entity0 's freedom			2
@entity142 started to explain that doctors treating @entity0 will decide when he is ready to talk , but @entity147 cut him off			2
why has n't he been returned to the @entity18 ? " @entity147 asked , noting that wounded soldiers from battle zones get flown back for treatment within days			0
" you 're trying to tell me that he 's being held at @entity6 , @entity7 , because of his medical condition ? " @entity142 responded , " congressman , i hope you 're not implying anything other than that , " as the two continued to talk over each other			0
" i do n't like the implication of the question , " @entity142 said at one point , and when @entity147 persisted about injured combat troops coming back to the @entity18 quickly , @entity142 raised his voice			0
" this is n't just about a physical situation , " he said			0
" this guy was held for almost five years in @entity180 knows what kind of conditions			0
