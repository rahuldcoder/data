@entity0 -- @entity2 hit the roads of the segregated @entity4 as a teen in the 1950s , using a travel guide that pointed out safe havens where @entity9 - @entity8 could eat and stay			1
the pamphlet promoted vacation without humiliation			0
on that trip in the 1950s , @entity2 journeyed the 1,000 miles from @entity14 to @entity15 with his mother , aunt and brother to attend his sister 's college graduation			0
his aunt and mother used the travel guide to plot the entire trip			1
" it was one of the survival tools of segregated life , " @entity2 says			0
@entity2 became a symbol of the civil rights movement as one of the @entity31 , a group of @entity8 students who braved death threats and harassment to become the first black students at @entity38 in the @entity14 state capital in 1957			1
a man with the same last name , but no relation , was behind the @entity8 travel guide , an institution among black families as they traveled the nation at a time when many businesses would n't allow them inside			1
@entity50 was a mail carrier in @entity53 's predominantly black neighborhood of @entity54			1
he was tall , handsome and personable			0
in 1932 , he came up with the idea for a travel book to prevent african - americans from being humiliated , especially in front of their families			1
" @entity60 , " as it was known , was first published in 1936			1
initially , it pointed out friendly restaurants and hotels in @entity53			0
it eventually expanded to include everything from lodging and gas stations to tailor shops and doctor 's offices across the nation , as well as in @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
" through this guide a number of white business places have come to value and desire your patronage , " @entity50 wrote in the 20th anniversary of his travel guide			1
" without your support ( the guide ) could not have remained in business and no doubt would have failed as others did			2
" we trust , in the future , your faith will be justified as in the past ; and in so doing , you will tell others of your satisfaction			0
" in the guide 's early years , @entity50 would travel to most locations his guide touted			1
but as the book expanded and he got older , he could n't visit every spot			0
in 1949 , the @entity60 -- officially called " @entity99 " -- noted @entity100 in @entity101 as a great place to stop			1
the book especially recommended the town of @entity105 , @entity106 , for being " owned and operated by @entity107			0
" in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity108 got a thumbs up			0
@entity112 is the author of " @entity122 " a book about how the road trip became part of the @entity8 lexicon after @entity117 she says african - americans had a much different experience than white travelers because they " were not free to travel throughout the nation , " especially in the segregated @entity4			1
" they wanted to educate themselves and their children , and they had a desire to see the country and go on vacation just like anyone who was white			0
and so they set about doing that , " she says			0
" to know where to stay , they could consult the @entity60			2
" @entity137 , an associate professor of @entity8 studies at @entity139 who has written extensively about automobiles and @entity8 society , adds that the @entity60 steered @entity8 " to these little oases for people of color			1
" " it gives us a history of what we might call ' driving while black , ' " @entity137 says			1
history had largely forgotten about the @entity60			1
then came author and playwright @entity150			0
he 'd never heard of the book until the funeral of a family friend in @entity155 about a decade ago			0
an older relative , coming from @entity53 , asked him , " do i need a @entity60 ? " " i said , ' what 's the @entity60 ? ' ... and that kind of sent me on a search			2
" @entity150 's play , " @entity60 , " debuted last year in @entity161 and featured former @entity163 head @entity162 as @entity50			1
@entity150 also wrote a children 's book , " @entity170 and the @entity60 , " about the perils a @entity101 family faced while traveling to @entity168 in 1952 to visit a grandmother			2
the family was welcomed at @entity172 gas stations , which sponsored the @entity60			2
" people were traveling but they were still having difficulties , " @entity150 says , adding that his works are a tribute to @entity50 for helping african - americans navigate their first @entity8 road trips			1
@entity150 recently read his children 's book to a group of fifth graders at an @entity0 school for @entity184			0
he encouraged the children to never forget the past -- and to keep on journeying across the country			0
the @entity60 eventually stopped being published in the 1960s , following the passage of the @entity190 , which outlawed forms of discrimination , including racial segregation			2
unlike most businessmen , @entity50 had always looked forward to the day his business would no longer be relevant			2
" there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published , " he wrote in his foreword in 1949			2
" that is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the @entity205			0
" it will be a great day for us to suspend this publication , for then we can go wherever we please , and without embarrassment			0
