-- when @entity3 prime minister @entity2 visits the @entity4 next week , he will carry with him grand hopes for a re-energized partnership between his country and the @entity8			1
fresh off a landslide victory in the @entity3 elections , @entity2 has seized an outright majority in parliament and a mandate for sweeping domestic reform			1
for years , the former chief minister of @entity16 faced an @entity8 visa ban due to his alleged role in violent riots			2
now , the new premier 's visit represents a key opportunity to recharge a critical bilateral relationship			1
it 's one the @entity8 and @entity3 should seize			1
routinely described as " natural allies , " @entity3 and the @entity8 have over the past year seemed more like estranged partners , united more by a sense of dashed expectations than by a shared approach to common challenges			1
@entity3 's economy , which grew 7.4 % annually between 2000 and 2011 , fell to 4.5 % growth in 2012 and has rebounded only slightly since			2
the economic slowdown prompted a more inward focus in @entity35 and questions in @entity37 about @entity3 's ability to generate national power			2
at the same time , key agreements went unsigned or unfulfilled , including a landmark civil nuclear accord , defense pacts aimed at deepening security cooperation and a stalled bilateral investment treaty			0
@entity3 government officials expressed worry about @entity48 's stated commitment to withdraw all troops from @entity50 ; @entity8 had their own concerns about @entity3 's disinclination to apply sanctions on @entity54			1
the fallout from the december 2013 arrest in @entity57 of @entity3 's deputy counsel general brought relations to a new low			0
@entity61 : why @entity2 visit crucial for @entity8 , @entity3 , world nevertheless , the strategic logic compelling closer bilateral ties remains sound			1
the @entity8 and @entity3 share interests , including ensuring a stable @entity67 balance of power , expanding economic relations , preserving access to the global commons , countering terrorism , expanding access to energy sources and supporting the expansion of human rights			2
@entity3 and the @entity8 view similarly the challenge posed by @entity78 's rise , seeking strong economic ties with @entity78 and good diplomatic relations with @entity81 while hedging by strengthening relations with other regional powers -- including each other			1
stronger ties with @entity3 signal that the @entity8 remains committed to an enduring presence in @entity67 and helps ensure that @entity78 ascends in a region where the great democratic powers are also strong			1
despite -- or perhaps because of -- the underlying strategic rationale for closer partnership , @entity8 and @entity3 leaders have too frequently sounded more romantic than realistic about the possibilities			2
rarely does a speech lack either a reference to the natural affinities between the " world 's oldest democracy and the world 's largest democracy " or high - flying rhetoric about the ease with which " natural allies " should work together			0
but invoking such romance risks raising expectations of effortless achievement , as if the compelling logic of two liberty - loving great powers working in harmony is itself sufficient to propel the relationship forward			0
the reality is more difficult and continuing to build a true strategic partnership will take senior - level ownership , hard work and the expenditure of diplomatic capital			0
@entity2 's visit should mark a new step toward that goal			1
an ambitious but realistic agenda of deepened political , economic and security ties would reverberate in the @entity123 region and beyond			0
as the two country 's leaders chart the next phase of the @entity8 - @entity3 relationship , they should outline a path forward that encompasses new activity in a broad range of areas			1
boosting economic and defense ties and enhancing regional cooperation should be at the top of the agenda			0
in practical terms , @entity37 and @entity35 should press ahead to complete their bilateral investment treaty negotiations , for instance , seek a resolution to their differences at the @entity143 and jump start trade liberalization talks			0
they should complete the implementation of the civil nuclear agreement and renew and expand their defense framework agreement , which expires next year			0
and they should deepen regional cooperation , including through dialogue on the shape of @entity50 after the 2016 withdrawal of @entity8 troops and by reviving the @entity8 - @entity3 - @entity155 - @entity154			2
@entity2 's visit to the @entity8 represents an important opportunity to rejuvenate bilateral ties after a period of malaise and inattention			1
once the pomp and ceremony of the visit have passed , the two countries must ensure that it does not represent a one - off attempt but rather the beginning of renewed attention to a relationship that requires constant tending			0
in so doing , they can deepen the transformation of relations between two great powers , anchor an @entity67 balance of power , spur growth in both countries and smooth the rise of the world 's largest democracy			0
in a world awash with intractable challenges , this is an investment worth making .			0
