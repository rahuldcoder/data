-- come sunday , every customer wo n't be equal at @entity2			1
that 's when the airline launches its " mint " business class service for customers willing to pay more for flights between @entity9 's @entity8 and @entity10			1
@entity2 has won over many fliers with its newer planes and egalitarian model of nice coach seats , video programming and snacks for everyone			2
there was no first - or business - class seating , but that changes june 15			2
it remains to be seen if @entity11 -- which offers fully flat beds , some private suites , dual power outlets with usb ports , amenity kits and a tapas menu -- will change perceptions of the airline			1
@entity2 officials hope to attract cost - conscious business class customers away from the higher priced business - and first - class service of traditional airlines			1
all seven daily flights between @entity8 and @entity10 will offer @entity11 service by year 's end , a company spokeswoman said			2
@entity2 also plans to offer @entity11 service between @entity9 's @entity8 and @entity42 by the end of the year			1
10 places we dare you to visit the price ? as low as $ 599 one - way			0
but if you spend more , you get more			0
one example : buy a nonstop , one - way ticket costing more than $ 750 , excluding taxes and fees , and you do n't have to pay a change fee if you need to reschedule your flight			0
@entity2 plans to dedicate 11 new @entity56 for the two routes , each with 16 lie - flat seats ( four of those are private suites )			1
all the benefits wo n't go to business class			2
coach customers will see some improvements as well			0
all customers will enjoy free @entity68 and in - seat power outlets in the new @entity71 aircraft			0
there will also be increased audio and television programming in coach seating			0
