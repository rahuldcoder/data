@entity7 host @entity6 , grappling with accusations that he embellished and / or fabricated reports placing him at the center of dramatic news events , tipped his hand more than he realized by threatening one of the many journalists asking questions about the accuracy of his accounts			1
" i am coming after you with everything i have , " @entity6 told @entity17 reporter @entity16			1
" you can take it as a threat			0
" bad move , @entity23			0
in the real world of tough guys ( as opposed to celebrity blowhards ) , that kind of empty threat only comes from a sore loser -- somebody unable to control or hide his anger , fright and impotence over the fact he has been cornered and beaten			0
there is nothing @entity6 can do to harm the @entity17 , its reporters or any other journalist doing their job , and he surely knows that			1
so why the tantrum ? part of it is @entity6 's style			1
he is a fabulously wealthy , best - selling author and the host of a show that has dominated prime - time cable news for many years			0
one way he got to the top of the heap was by styling himself as a plain - spoken , working - class battler , willing to mix it up verbally with those who disagree with him			0
as ex- rep. @entity59 -- a gay , outspokenly @entity60 who sparred with @entity6 -- explained to @entity61 : " when you go on his show , you have two choices : either be reasonable and let him dominate with his ranting , or yell back at him			1
you either look timid or as boorish as he is			0
" the verbal fireworks make for a certain kind of tv that can be fun to watch and has proved enormously popular , but it does n't give @entity6 a pass to make things up and not get called on it			1
his dramatic claims to have reported from a war zone during the @entity73 conflict -- an account complete with troops firing into crowds , a gun pointed at his head and @entity6 saving a gravely wounded colleague -- has been disputed by seven of his colleagues who were on assignment in @entity81 with him			1
more recently , reporters have questioned @entity6 's claim -- printed in his book , " @entity84 " -- to have heard the gunshot that killed @entity86 , a friend of @entity87 , the man who killed president @entity88			1
@entity86 's death was dramatic , important news : he killed himself in @entity91 shortly after being contacted by congressional investigators probing the assassination			0
it 's hard to believe that @entity6 , then working on stories about the assassination for @entity98 television station @entity97 , would have sat on the news that he was present and heard the shotgun blast that killed @entity86			1
once again , a little probing by journalists turns up evidence from reliable sources that @entity6 's account is probably false			1
@entity104 , a former @entity105 editor , has posted audio tapes of @entity6 talking with a congressional investigator around the time of the incident in conversations that leave little doubt that @entity6 was in @entity98 at the time @entity86 died			2
" he was in @entity98 " says @entity112 , who worked at @entity97 at the time , according to the @entity113			0
" @entity6 's a phony -- there 's no other way to put it			2
" @entity117 , former columnist and veteran @entity118 insider who is a friend of @entity6 's , defended him in a way that is less than helpful			2
" @entity6 is an entertainer and everything he does is totally subjective , including his memories , " she told @entity61			2
" to attack him is simply to increase his ratings and the sales of his phenomenally popular books			0
" that 's easier said than done , especially after @entity6 chose to start threatening reporters			2
his best move now would be to do the difficult , responsible thing , the thing truly great journalists have been doing for decades : admit he screwed up , apologize and try to move on			2
that might damage his brand as the swaggering no - spin guy , and it might even lose him some viewers			0
but it would begin to restore his reputation in a profession that is n't perfect and does n't expect its practitioners to be -- but also does n't expect valid questions to be answered with the snarling , empty threats of a coward .			0

@entity148 : @entity6 , accused of fabricating reports , threatened @entity17 reporter , saying : " i *'m* coming after you *...* "
louis : he placed himself in stories he was not in , former colleagues say . @entity6 should come clean , apologize
