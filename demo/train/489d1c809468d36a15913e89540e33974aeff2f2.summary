editor 's note : @entity2 is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts " @entity2 : gps " on @entity4 at 1 p.m. et sundays			1
@entity2 says he does n't think the crisis between @entity6 and @entity7 is likely to be resolved soon			1
@entity8 ( @entity4 ) -- @entity6 prime minister @entity9 has accused the @entity10 of orchestrating the conflict in @entity7 to benefit one of its presidential candidates			1
in an exclusive interview thursday with @entity4 's @entity16 in the @entity18 city of @entity19 , @entity6 , @entity9 said the @entity10 had encouraged @entity7 to attack the autonomous region of @entity21			1
@entity9 said his defense officials had told him it was done to benefit a presidential candidate , but he presented no evidence to back it up			0
" @entity10 citizens were indeed in the area in conflict , " @entity9 said			2
" they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered , and the only one who can give such orders is their leader			0
" @entity33 spokeswoman @entity32 blasted @entity9 's statements , saying they were " patently false			0
" @entity6 is trying to counterbalance mounting pressure from the @entity37 over its military action in @entity7 and its recognition of the breakaway regions of @entity41 and @entity21			1
but @entity6 's hopes of winning international support were dashed thursday when @entity44 and other @entity46 nations expressed concern about tension in the region			1
the joint declaration from the @entity51 , which includes @entity44 , @entity6 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , said the countries hoped that any further conflict could be resolved peacefully			2
@entity4 spoke to world affairs expert and author @entity2 about the @entity6 - @entity7 situation			1
@entity4 : is the crisis between @entity6 and @entity7 likely to get resolved soon ? @entity2 : no , positions are actually hardening			1
the @entity6 have formally recognized the two regions of @entity7 -- @entity41 and @entity21 -- and on our program , the @entity7 president , @entity64 , has demanded the withdrawal of @entity6 peacekeepers , to be replaced by @entity70 peacekeepers			1
so the two sides are actually further apart than they were 10 days ago			0
@entity4 : who will prevail ? @entity2 : it 's difficult to see the circumstances under which @entity6 will withdraw completely			1
on the other hand , its recognition of the two provinces is a joke			2
almost no country in the world has followed them in this recognition			0
so they might be willing to reverse themselves on this issue			0
but i ca n't see them getting out completely			0
@entity4 : so @entity6 wins ? @entity2 : well , even if it wins in the narrow sense , it will lose in a broader sense			2
@entity6 's actions have scared all their neighbors , aroused anti-russian nationalism , driven the @entity95 , the @entity96 and so many other countries closer to the @entity37 and away from @entity98			1
countries around the world have been startled by the @entity102 - era tactics			0
and what have they gained for all this ? @entity21			0
i think this will go down in history as a major strategic blunder			1
the @entity6 have massively overplayed their hand			0
@entity4 : why did they do it ? @entity2 : they would argue that the @entity37 pushed and punished them after the collapse of the @entity102 and that by expanding @entity115 to their borders , it signaled that it still saw @entity6 as a rival and relations as competitive			2
perhaps there is some truth to their perception , but there were also much broader developments in @entity6 over the last decade			0
the rise of @entity6 nationalism , an anti-western and anti-democratic movement , the rise of an elected dictatorship , and above all , the rise in oil wealth , which always produces corruption , dysfunction and arrogance			0
@entity6 has moved in anti-modern directions , and much of it has nothing to do with what the @entity37 did or did n't do			1
@entity4 : what should the @entity10 do ? @entity2 : assist @entity7 in rebuilding and securing itself			1
assure countries like @entity95 that may be insecure			0
but also , do n't overreact			2
@entity6 's blunder is producing a reaction in the region and across the world			1
let that play itself out			0
we should be firm in insisting that they can not re-impose their rule in @entity7 , but there is little to be gained in a total cutoff with @entity98			0
we have to deal with @entity6 on many issues , from @entity153 to @entity154			0
nobody benefits from a new @entity156 , not the @entity6 and not the @entity10			2

@entity2 says @entity6 's actions will be viewed as " a major strategic blunder "
@entity2 calls @entity6 's recognition of @entity7 's two breakaway provinces " a joke "
analyst : @entity6 has moved in " anti-modern " directions in recent years
@entity2 says @entity10 should n't overreact , let world reaction play itself out
