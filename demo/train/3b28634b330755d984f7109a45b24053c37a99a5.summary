-- more than 30 years after her frantic cries of " a dingo 's got my baby , " an @entity2 coroner has ruled that the words @entity4 screamed that night were true			1
@entity8 was just two months old when she disappeared from her family 's tent at a public campsite near @entity12 , also known as @entity12 , in @entity2 's @entity13			2
speculation about what happened to @entity16 polarized public opinion in @entity2 and became the subject of a 1988 feature film " @entity22 " starring @entity21 actress @entity20			1
thirty - two years after losing her daughter , @entity24 - @entity23 sat shaking in the @entity27 court tuesday as she waited to hear the results of the fourth and now final inquest into @entity16 's death			1
" shortly after mrs @entity24 placed @entity16 in the tent , a dingo or dingoes entered the tent , took @entity16 and carried and dragged her from the immediate area , " said coroner @entity31			1
" it it is clear that there is evidence that in particular circumstances a dingo is capable of attacking , taking and causing the death of young children , " she added			2
coroner rules dingo to blame for @entity2 baby 's death outside the court , @entity24 - @entity23 said her family was " relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga			1
" we live in a beautiful country but it is dangerous and we would ask all @entity2 to be aware of this and take appropriate precautions and not wait for somebody else to do it for them , " she added			2
the official finding that a dingo -- a type of wild dog -- killed @entity16 ends a legal battle that has been fought over four inquests , a murder trial , through @entity68 and @entity69 appeals and a judicial inquiry			1
until tuesday , questions had remained over the cause of @entity16 's death , despite a 1988 ruling quashing @entity24 - @entity23 's conviction and life sentence for her daughter 's murder			1
turning to address the family directly , @entity79 said : " please accept my sincere sympathy on the death of your special and loved daughter and sister @entity16			1
" i 'm so sorry for your loss			2
@entity91 does not remove the pain and sadness at the death of a child , " she added , her voice straining with emotion			0
@entity96 , the lawyer who has represented the couple throughout their ordeal , described the atmosphere inside the court as " electric			0
" " when the coroner extended her sympathy and broke down herself i do n't think there were too many dry eyes , " he said			2
when the @entity24 left the court room they were given a standing ovation , he added , and later outside they were applauded by the waiting press			1
" i 've never seen that done before			0
i thought that really indicates how the tide has changed			0
" everything changed for @entity4 and @entity114 on the night of august 17 , 1980			2
court documents stated , @entity4 , then 32 , left the campsite barbecue to put her daughter and six - year - old son @entity118 to bed in the family tent where her other son , four - year - old @entity121 , was already asleep			1
according to her testimony , @entity4 tucked @entity16 into her bassinet before going with @entity124 to the car to get some baked beans after he complained that he was hungry			1
" there is no doubt that she did return to the barbecue area , accompanied by @entity118 and carrying the tin of beans and a tin opener , about five or ten minutes after she had left			0
she seemed normal and quite composed			0
no one saw any blood on her clothes or her person , " the court documents read			0
it was during her absence from the barbecue that the prosecution alleged @entity4 slit her baby 's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding the body , possibly in a camera bag			0
she was alleged to have buried the body later near the campsite with the help of her husband @entity153			0
he was charged with being an accessory to murder after the fact in a conviction that was later quashed			1
outside the court tuesday , @entity114 declared , " the truth is out			0
" " this battle to get to the legal truth about what caused @entity16 's death has taken too long , " he said			1
" however , i am here to tell you that you can get justice even when you think that all is lost			0
" during their long battle for justice , the @entity24 divorced			1
@entity16 would have turned 32 on monday , june 11			2
" it is the end of the legal journey , there 's nothing else from a legal perspective we wanted to achieve , " said @entity96			0
" we were quite determined and have been over the past 31 years that we would keep going until we achieved everything that we set out to achieve , " he said			0
soon after the inquest findings were delivered , @entity24 - @entity23 appeared before the press holding a copy of her baby 's death certificate			1
" i think it 's just an enormous relief , " @entity96 said			0
" she like everybody in there was hoping for what we ended up with today			0
" however , he added : " if we had n't have got the result today we would have kept going , as simple as that			0

@entity24 - @entity23 : " we are relieved and delighted " by finding
