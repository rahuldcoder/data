@entity1 authorities have arrested a wife of @entity4 leader @entity3 -- the man spearheading the @entity8 terror group 's sweeping rampage across @entity9 and @entity10 -- said a source with knowledge of the arrest			1
the woman is one of @entity16 's two wives			1
her arrest came as part of a " planned operation , " according to the source			1
the source described her as a " powerful figure ( who is ) heavily involved in @entity4			2
" not much is known about the reported wife , including what her involvement is with the terrorist group , if any			1
" we will gain some intelligence from her			2
we may get insights into @entity16 's movement , who he surrounds himself with , whether he was injured , and the degree of his injuries , " said rep. @entity29 , a @entity31 @entity30			1
another intelligence source identified the wife as @entity40			1
she was detained with her 4 - year - old son more than a week ago when they tried to enter @entity1 , that source said			2
the arrest was a coordinated operation involving agencies from @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity1 , said the intelligence source			1
the source said the @entity10 had help from @entity49 intelligence			1
in @entity51 , the @entity50 declined to comment			0
also in @entity51 , several @entity49 sources suggested the person arrested was @entity16 's ex-wife , not a current one			1
@entity55 has been calling for the release of his son , the intelligence source said , adding that @entity58 was released from @entity9 custody in march as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in exchange for a group of @entity9 nuns			1
the @entity67 nuns had been kidnapped and held captive by the @entity69 - linked @entity68 , which @entity16 had helped establish			1
@entity1 authorities did n't immediately respond to requests for comment from @entity73			0
@entity75 , citing unidentified @entity1 security officials , reported one of @entity16 's sons was detained			1
but @entity79 , also citing @entity1 officials , said that a daughter , rather than a son , was being held			0
the two agencies similarly differed on when the two were picked up by @entity1 forces : @entity79 said it happened " in recent days ; " @entity75 reported it was 10 days ago			2
regardless , the very idea that a government may be holding close relatives of @entity16 is significant , given his pivotal role in @entity4 ' meteoric rise , the extremist group 's widely reviled tactics under his leadership and the breadth of the international coalition aimed at defeating @entity4			1
" it 's certainly a new dynamic because we 've never seen anybody connected so close to @entity16 being detained , " terrorism expert @entity96 said			1
at the same time , the reports raise a lot of questions , such as what the family members might have been doing in @entity1			0
" is he estranged from them ? has he fallen out with them ? were they escaping from him ? " asked @entity96 , who is the international security director at the @entity110			0
@entity1 is one of several countries heavily affected by @entity9 's yearslong conflict and the flood of refugees trying to escape the violence			2
@entity1 authorities " have been cracking down very heavily on the border to prevent members of @entity4 seeping into @entity1 , " @entity96 said			0
" they do n't want the problems spilling over from @entity10 and @entity9 into their territory			0
" another question raised by the reports is whether the wife is affiliated with @entity4			2
" if she 's simply an ex-wife , the first thing you got to deal with is she 's an innocent person , potentially , who was married to a bad guy , with a child , " said @entity128 , a former @entity50 counterterrorism official			1
" the first hurdle ... before we deal with what she knows , is how closely was she affiliated , and how hard can you press her based on that affiliation			0
that 's an ethical question , " he said			0
mystery surrounds arrest of woman who may be @entity4 leader 's wife @entity4 rises after @entity16 took over the group that in 2006 would become @entity4 began in @entity10 , where it targeted the @entity49 - led coalition as well as @entity149 in the country			1
it suffered heavy losses , but ascended over the past few years to take advantage of a void wrought by @entity9 's civil war as well as instability in @entity10			0
not coincidentally , this all happened after @entity16 took over @entity4 in 2010			1
before that , he 'd been at a @entity49 prison camp for insurgents at @entity161 in southern @entity10 , where he was taken after being detained in february 2004 amid fighting in the flashpoint city of @entity164			2
media reports have claimed @entity49 authorities held @entity16 for four years			1
but the @entity167 has offered a different time line , saying he was at @entity161 until early december 2004 , when officials there recommended his " unconditional release			0
" beyond this , little is known about @entity16			2
according to the @entity49 government , he was born in @entity176 , @entity10 , and is in his early 40s			2
what motivates him , how he was trained and who he 's close to -- including his family -- largely remains a mystery			0
he has emerged from the shadows in fits and spurts			0
after the death of @entity69 leader @entity185 in 2011 , @entity16 issued a eulogy in which he threatened violent retribution			2
( @entity69 disowned @entity4 earlier this year , blaming it for " the enormity of the disaster that afflicted " others trying to unseat @entity9 president @entity191			0
) there were unconfirmed suggestions last month that @entity3 had been wounded in airstrikes in northern @entity10			0
but days later , an audio recording emerged that purportedly contained a message from @entity16 saying the @entity49 - led coalition to destroy @entity4 is " terrified , weak and powerless			1
" ' he 's created this myth ' @entity4 itself has never been more powerful , having taken over vast swaths of territory in @entity10 and @entity9 in the past few years			0
and it has used brutal tactics to do so -- such as mass kidnappings , rapes , killings and other abuses against civilians and fighting foes alike , actions that a @entity213 panel characterized as war crimes and crimes against humanity			0
@entity217 , who has gone by a variety of aliases during his career in terrorism , has been at the center of it			0
the @entity224 's @entity226 program , which refers to him as " @entity3 , " offers $ 10 million for information leading to his arrest			1
when his group rebranded itself as the @entity233 in june , @entity230 was tapped as spiritual leader of the new caliphate			0
he 's sought to burnish his theological credentials , with a biography posted on jihadist websites last year claiming he had earned a doctorate in @entity243 studies from a university in @entity245			0
" his knowledge in @entity243 jurisprudence is somewhat dubious , but nevertheless he 's created this myth and this aura behind him , " @entity96 said .			0
