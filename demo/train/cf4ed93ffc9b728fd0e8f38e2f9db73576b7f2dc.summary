-- there have been a few moments in our history when a generation has used the power of its numbers and its passion for a cause to transcend a deeply divided society and change the course of the future for the better			2
we 've come to one of those moments			0
about every 80 years , a young civic generation has forced the nation to deal with its fundamental challenges , according to @entity17 and @entity18 in their 2011 book , " @entity21			2
" they cite the @entity23 , the @entity24 and the @entity25 as key moments when a generation came together to create a different society			2
today 's millennial generation is the next generation to wield that power			1
i am a baby boomer			0
in the late 1960s , my generation rallied to make the case that a woman 's right to choose should be guaranteed , and , 40 years ago on tuesday , the @entity33 handed down the landmark @entity41 decision			1
today , younger than 40 have always lived in an @entity42 where abortion has been legal			1
the pre-roe v. @entity42 is an @entity42 i remember all too well			0
before and after @entity41 privileged women traveled overseas to get a safe , legal abortion			1
however , more often than not , women stayed in the @entity47 and were forced to go to back - street providers where they were humiliated and sometimes even died from these procedures			0
memories of that era are fading as time goes by			0
but this past election cycle has proved that reproductive rights are still on the line			0
while @entity41 might guarantee the right to choose , a loud and organized movement is chipping away at a woman 's ability to exercise her reproductive rights			1
in 2012 , lawmakers enacted 42 anti-choice measures in 25 states			0
as @entity41 marks its 40th anniversary , @entity17 and @entity18 's millennial generation is coming of age			1
numbering 77 million , by the 2020 election , they will make up nearly 40 % of the electorate			1
they are educated , motivated and progressive			0
they will be able to sway elections , determine public policy and transform @entity42			0
research tells us that millennials are overwhelmingly pro-choice , and we have seen them take a stand			1
like most of the public , millennials believe that politicians should not interfere with women 's health care			2
and in turn , millennials have joined efforts to defeat @entity84 's " personhood " amendment , to protect funding for women 's health services and to reject anti-choice candidates in the 2012 election			2
but it is crucial that even more pro-choice millennials continue to see the connection between the personal and the political because anti-choice activists are not slowing down			1
four decades after @entity41 : a legacy of law and morality during the past two presidential elections , we have seen millennials ' ability to exercise their power , speak up and change the fabric of our nation			1
many are speaking up online , in the voting booth , at the grass - roots level and in the hallways of our organizations			0
they are telling their stories and charting their own path , but it is critical that we create pathways to broaden and build a new conversation about protecting women 's reproductive health			0
there is tremendous promise for what this generation can achieve , and where it wants to lead the conversation about the right to choose			2
as @entity41 turns 40 , the story of choice is at a crossroads			1
i know , with our voices combined , we will secure this hard - fought freedom for generations to come			0
