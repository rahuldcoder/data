@entity0 , @entity1 -- a previously unknown armed group said friday it attacked a @entity1 oil pipeline this week on the first full day in office for @entity1 's new acting president			1
the attempt by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) of the @entity11 was not successful , a spokesman for the military said			1
but it indicates not everyone in @entity1 is happy with the way the new president , who hails from the @entity11 region , was given power			1
the @entity10 said that early wednesday , one of its units attacked and " exploded " the @entity21 manifold owned by @entity22 in @entity23 , near the coast			1
the manifold connects several pipelines to the @entity27			0
" our patriotic fighters fought and overpowered the military guards on duty ( as all @entity22 manifolds are always heavily guarded ) before going ahead to explode the @entity21 manifold , " the group 's statement said			1
but lt. col. @entity35 , a spokesman for the @entity1 military , said the attack failed			1
" on wednesday night there was an attempt by criminals to sabotage a @entity22 pipeline , " he told @entity2			0
" they were thwarted in their attempt by a community surveillance group assigned to protect the @entity22 pipeline			0
" @entity35 said the group 's dynamite and other explosives were recovered and that there were no injuries or deaths			0
a spokesman for @entity22 in @entity51 , @entity52 , said the company had received no report of an attack			2
the @entity10 said its attack wednesday followed another last weekend , and that both are aimed at incapacitating the export terminal and fighting the " occupation " in @entity1			1
" the actions are continuous and are preparatory to the final war			0
every little step we take today brings us closer to freedom , " read the statement			0
acting president @entity66 was approved for the role tuesday by @entity1 's @entity68 and @entity69 to fill the political void left after president @entity71 departed in november for medical treatment in @entity73			1
@entity66 was previously the country 's vice president			1
in his first address to the nation tuesday , @entity66 praised the " resilience and unity of purpose " with which @entity1 reacted to the recent political upheaval , saying there were " no winners and no losers " and that it is now time to move forward			1
he called on all @entity1 and the country 's political parties to " tackle the various challenges which we face as a nation , " including those in the areas of power , infrastructure , security and job creation			2
@entity66 also vowed to pursue the " war against corruption " more robustly			2
his appointment has stirred controversy in @entity1 , @entity99 's most populous nation , with some arguing that the articles of the @entity1 constitution were not followed with the transfer of power			2
@entity1 's constitution says the president must formally communicate to the @entity105 that he is empowering the vice president to act as president in his absence			1
while no such formal communication was given , the @entity69 declared tuesday that a january 13 @entity111 interview with @entity71 from his hospital bed could constitute such a notice			0
in the interview , the president acknowledged that he could not perform the duties of his office and would not be able to return until his doctors declared him fit			0
in a separate statement , the @entity10 called @entity66 a " lame - duck ruler " and termed his acting presidency an " illegality " because of questions over the transfer of power			1
the group said @entity66 was appointed in a " jungle manner			2
" " the purported interview granted the @entity111 by the deserter president can never ( be ) approximated to a ( formal ) / official letter which ought to be duly endorsed by the writer , " the @entity10 said			2
" the deserting act of @entity71 can only be appropriately categorized as gross misconduct and should naturally have attracted an impeachment			0
this ought to have been followed by the swearing in of the vice president as substantive president , not in an acting capacity			0
" the group said the political events will not deter their " resolve to wage a continuous revolutionary war to liberate all parts of our territory			0
" @entity2 's @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
