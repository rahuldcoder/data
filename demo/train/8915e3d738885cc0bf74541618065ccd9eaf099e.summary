-- for many @entity3 , the devastating floods in @entity2 are a stark reminder of the disaster @entity3 experienced just two years ago as a result of @entity7			1
i remember being in shock as i made my way across our battered state , seeing so many of our most treasured features -- our covered bridges , fertile farmland , historic downtowns , and winding rural roads -- destroyed by the tremendous force of floodwater			2
the storm 's 60 - mph winds and up to 11 inches of rain damaged 3,500 homes and businesses , 500 miles of state roads and 200 bridges			2
and tragically , six lives were lost , including those of a father and son , city employees who were checking on the community 's wastewater treatment facility			2
@entity2 floods : stories of grief , generosity and gratitude in the days , weeks and months that followed @entity40 , @entity3 state government joined together with our local and federal government , nonprofits , and legions of volunteers to get people and communities back on their feet as quickly as possible			1
at the @entity50 , we responded to spills of hazardous waste , gasoline and oil			2
we helped communities repair drinking water and sewage treatment systems			2
we supported our transportation agency and our cities and towns as they quickly rebuilt roads and bridges			2
we responded to calls to address the large accumulations of gravel , tree trunks , cars , refrigerators , propane tanks and endless amounts of debris that threatened to cause further damage to bridges , roads and homes , or presented a risk of harm to public health and safety			2
how to help from that emergency response , we learned a few critical lessons that i offer for our counterparts in @entity2 : sleep and eat			1
this flood emergency response will continue for many weeks			1
it is a marathon , not a sprint , and you and your staff can only be helpful if you take care of your own basic needs			0
many folks want to help , including experts who are prepared to pitch in at a moment 's notice			0
take some time to think carefully about where you could use the extra boots on the ground and ask for assistance			0
the first casualty of a crisis is information			0
make sure you have the facts before you act			0
talk to the folks in the field			0
share relevant information with the emergency response directors			0
let the public know what you know through updates and guidance from your experts			0
you can not communicate too much			0
build back with resilience in mind			1
two years after @entity40 , we are still recovering			0
communities are still rebuilding roads and bridges			0
some destroyed houses can still be seen , too damaged to repair			0
perhaps as a consequence of global climate disruption we are seeing significant increases in the frequency and intensity of storms in @entity3 so that even as we rebuild , many of our communities have faced additional flooding since @entity40			1
from these facts , we have learned that it is important to look ahead and rebuild with future resilience to flooding in mind			1
once the water goes down , everyone will have the same initial instinct to quickly replace everything and restore communities to the way they were before the flood			1
sometimes that instinct is correct			0
putting a road or bridge back as soon as possible may be critical to a community 's ability to ensure that its citizens can get emergency services and food			1
but other times , the desire to put everything back just the way it was before is misplaced			1
we discovered in @entity3 that much of the damage we experienced after @entity40 mirrored damage from flooding in 1927 and again in the 1970s , because we rebuilt in the same way and in the same places			1
we are trying not to repeat that mistake			0
so when we rebuild our roads , culverts , bridges and wastewater and drinking water systems , we are taking into account the more intense weather events we can expect in the future , and we are building this infrastructure to withstand future flooding			0
we are also taking advantage of our natural assets to make us more flood - resilient by giving our rivers room to move and by protecting our natural systems such as floodplains , wetlands and vegetation along river corridors			1
this will provide critical flood protections for our communities			2
for the moment , however , we in @entity3 know well that the first priority in @entity2 must be to rescue those whose lives are at risk , to reconnect communities and families that have been cut off by the disaster , and to ensure that every person has a place to stay and food to eat			1
we also know that this first emergency response will be just the first step on what will be a long and challenging journey			0
for all of these reasons , our hearts and prayers are with all @entity205			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 : @entity3 ' hearts and prayers are with flood *victims* in @entity2
she says @entity3 learned lessons from the epic floods from @entity7
@entity208 : one lesson is to resist *temptation* to build back in the same form as before
