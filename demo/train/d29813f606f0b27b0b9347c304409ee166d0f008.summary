-- @entity1 is a company focused on problem solving			1
it has untold amounts of computing power at its disposal working away to try and solve big problems			0
but one issue requires a more analog approach : upping the number of female computer engineers			2
during his keynote address at the @entity15 developers conference this month , co-founder @entity12 said that @entity1 had been focused on recruiting more women " forever " to ensure that the company did n't end up all male			1
" the only answer is , we have to start early and make sure we get more women and girls excited in technology , " said @entity12			2
" there 's no question we will double the rate of progress			0
" the company has a number of year - round initiatives aimed at hiring and educating more women programmers , including scholarships and events			1
the annual developers ' conference offers a rare public , visual example of the industry 's gender gap and the company 's progress			1
in the past , women attendees and speakers have been underrepresented in the conference halls and on its stages			2
since the conference started in 2008 , @entity1 has been working to shift the numbers			1
according to @entity1 vice president @entity48 , the percentage of women at this year 's @entity15 was in the teens , up from a single - digit slice at last year 's conference			1
@entity1 has worked to shine a spotlight on the accomplshed women working in technology now , as well as the women who have done important work in the field throughout history			1
the women @entity61 featured some of @entity1 's high - ranking women , and the event was quickly filled to capacity with a mix of men and women			1
" its been a priority from the beginning ... the visibly of technical women is something we really want to work on , " said @entity48 , who works at @entity1 [ x ] , @entity1 's semi-secretive experimental wing that works on futuristic projects and prototypes			1
first @entity1 made a concerted effort to find talented women in the field from around the world to invite to the conference			1
" we felt like there were incredible technical women who should be at @entity15 , who for whatever reason were n't there , " said @entity48			2
" we did a lot of work to just make sure that we were increasing the presence of women leaders ... on the stage and in demos			2
" they also organized a social event for all the women attendees and offered on - site day care for all parents attending the conference			1
kids were also welcome on the floor , and one dad wrote in to say it had been a great father - daughter event			0
another continuing part of @entity1 's approach is community building for women already in the field so that they feel less isolated			1
the company held a women @entity111 social for female @entity15 attendees before the conference			1
women were invited to meet their peers , enjoy some wine and food from the @entity1 kitchen , and then break off into teams up to create unique projects using @entity122 and arts and crafts supplies			1
developer @entity125 was at the event and came all the way from @entity128 to attend the conference after @entity1 invited her			1
@entity125 is the founder of @entity131 , an @entity132 and @entity134 app development company in @entity135			0
she started the company after serving as a programmer with the @entity128 @entity139 , and she is a mentor for mobile development at @entity1 's @entity128 campus			2
" i think @entity1 can ( and should ) expand their efforts to be more visible to the general public and not just to the people who are already in the industry , " said @entity125			2
" incorporate more women into their commercials , make sure to advertise women tech - makers events throughout the year and eventually also expand the relevant age groups to focus on younger girls			1
" @entity48 is influenced by the success of the @entity154 school in southern @entity155 , headed up by president @entity156			0
its computer science department is now 44 % women , thanks to efforts by the school to figure out why more women were n't joining in the first place			0
what it found was partially a pr problem			0
some women did n't think the field sounded interesting due to a lack of understanding of what the work entailed			0
they also did n't think they 'd be good at it			0
" young women are very interested in having an impact on the world , " said @entity48			0
" we have n't connected the dots for them " that coding can have a direct impact on issues that are important to them			0
it 's not just a matter of reaching out to young people			0
women are getting into computer science later in life as returning professionals			0
and going back to college is n't the only way to learn programming , according to @entity48			0
anyone can take classes on sites like @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198			0
female programmers are also spreading the word on their own			0
@entity125 is doing her part by teaching her young nieces how to program			0
" we as a society need to make sure that more young boys and girls are exposed to this kind of education as early in possible in life , and i think that @entity1 plays a major role in our achieving that goal			2

@entity1 is *encouraging* more women to enter male - *dominated* tech fields
the company invited more women to its annual developers conference this year
day care and scholarships are also being used to *attract* women engineers
