-- the mega-wealthy @entity1 foolishly said the issue of income inequality should be discussed " in quiet rooms			0
" he was wrong about that -- and it would be wrong to discuss press freedom and national security in an off - the - record setting			1
it 's kind of awkward to have a secret conversation about greater transparency			2
to their credit , media outlets like @entity0 , the @entity13 , @entity14 , the @entity15 and @entity16 have all refused to participate in such an off - the - record session			1
there is a better way : bring the conversation out into the public square			2
attorney general @entity23 , a principled , decent public servant , needs to listen to his better angels and hold a very public discussion about the issues that led his @entity28 to obtain the phone records of as many as 100 @entity15 journalists and name a @entity14 reporter as a " co-conspirator " in a leaks case			1
as a former government official , i want my government to keep some things secret			0
now , as a member of the media , i also want sunlight to disinfect as much as possible			2
leaks truly can cost lives , and no member of the media should sugarcoat that reality or shirk their responsibility to public safety			1
and yet secretly pawing through phone records , targeting journalists , these actions are inconsistent with a truly free press			1
it is a balancing act , to be sure			0
but based on the reports we have seen , @entity23 's @entity28 has lost all balance			1
this continues a troubling trend			0
the @entity58 administration was no great friend of the free press -- and the media shamefully marched in near - lockstep to the deeply dishonest @entity58 - @entity64 drumbeat for war in @entity66			1
because our government deceived and our media ( with some notable exceptions ) did n't dig out the truth , @entity67 made what national security journalist and author @entity73 has called " the biggest mistake in the history of @entity67 foreign policy			1
" i wish there had been more leaks in the run - up to the @entity83			1
and yet there have been times when i have seen what looks like operational details of counterterrorism efforts in the media and thought , " why did n't they keep that secret ? now @entity92 knows what we 're doing			0
" so how do we balance the right to publish against the responsibility to protect the nation ? how do we walk the line between freedom and security ? it is a question as old as the republic			0
and it is one that needs to be debated robustly -- and publicly			0
@entity23 should bring the whole debate out into the public square -- and the more public , the better			1
he should ask a high - powered group of leading public citizens to examine the issue fully and , if need be , loudly			1
veteran journalists like @entity112 's @entity111 and @entity0 's @entity113 have covered war and peace for decades			0
current practitioners like @entity16 's @entity117 , who covers the @entity118 expertly , and the @entity120 's @entity119 , who has deep sources in intelligence , might be asked			0
national security veterans like @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and former @entity128 head @entity127 could give powerful voice to the very real threats posed by leaks			1
former military officers like retired maj. gen. @entity133 have seen the intersection of intelligence and war - fighting , and i 'd sure like to know the perspective of retired gen. @entity140 , whose military career was done in by incendiary comments by his staff to the press			0
marquee names not only bring experience , they bring attention			0
academics like @entity150 's @entity149 ( the @entity151 ; how perfect is that ? ) and @entity154 's @entity153 could perhaps contribute a less self - interested perspective than either the journos or the government officials			2
it 's probably a mistake to name names , and i 'm sure others can come up with a first - class lineup			2
but blue - ribbon panels sometimes get a bum rap			0
far better to have this conversation , which goes to the heart of our democracy , in the open , on the record in full view of we , the people			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2

@entity23 under fire for @entity28 inquiry of media phone records
@entity174 says @entity23 's off - the - record meeting with media was a bad idea
he says we need a very public discussion of balancing public *access* *vs.* security
@entity190 : we would have been better off with more leaks in advance of @entity83
