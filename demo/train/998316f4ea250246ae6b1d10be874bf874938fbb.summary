@entity0 -- those slick , intricate tests used by forensic investigators on shows like " csi " look infallible , but that is the stuff of television			0
in the real world , forensic tests are much more ambiguous and rarely demonstrate a definite tie between an individual and a crime			2
the @entity13 found that @entity15 crime labs lack uniform standards , training and oversight			1
that 's what the @entity13 found when it studied the nation 's forensic crime labs for two years			1
what the academy discovered was a " badly fragmented " system that produces inconsistent results and needs a major overhaul			1
in its report published wednesday , the academy showed there is a serious lack of uniform standards , training and oversight			1
and , with the exception of dna technology , the report concludes experts often overstate how much can be determined by forensic techniques running the gamut from fingerprinting to bite mark and hair analysis			1
according to the findings , except for dna technology , " no forensic method has been rigorously shown to have the capacity to consistently , and with a high degree of certainty , demonstrate a connection between evidence and a specific individual or source			0
" the report noted that forensic experts in court cases often overstate what can be proven by forensic methods and even attach a numerical percentage of accuracy that may not be based on clearly established scientific standards			2
the panel recommends that @entity60 create an independent @entity61 that could formulate standards for various forensic disciplines , regulate training and accreditation , and lead research			1
another recommendation is that crime labs should be autonomous and not controlled by police departments or prosecutors ' offices to head off any real or perceived bias toward law enforcement			0
the report also says many labs are " underfunded and understaffed , which contributes to case backlogs and makes it hard for laboratories to do as much as they could to inform investigations and avoid errors			0
" one of the co-chairs of the study , judge @entity81 , who sits on the @entity82 in @entity0 , says much is at stake			0
" we determine whether people are innocent or whether they are guilty in part based on forensic science evidence , so as a nation it is terribly important to us that we do it as well as it can be done , " @entity81 told @entity1			0
" and we are not doing it as well as it can be done right now			0
" @entity81 said the panel received input from members of the forensic science community who agreed that improvements can be made			0
@entity101 , a professor of biostatistics at @entity103 and the other co-chair of the study , says the goal of the forensic community should be " how to do the science better , how to report it more reliably ... and then how to practice it in a way that is uniform and according to standards across the country			1
" the report does not examine specific cases but looks at various forensic techniques used in thousands of trials			1
in the area of firearm analysis -- a discipline used by police crime labs to determine if a bullet recovered in a crime might have come from a particular gun -- the report says , " sufficient studies have not been done to understand the reliability and repeatability of the methods			1
" fingerprints are used by law enforcement every day			0
the report notes the quality of the prints can vary greatly and that individual analysts " make subjective assessments " in trying to decide if a print can be linked to a particular individual			0
therefore , the report states , " zero - error rates are not plausible			0
" on hair analysis , the panel found : " there appear to be no uniform standards on the number of features on which hairs must agree before an examiner may declare a ' match			1
' " while the report says dna analysis has the highest degree of certainty , it says other techniques can help narrow the field of suspects in an investigation			2
@entity154 , chairman of the @entity155 , said his group supports a comprehensive review of forensic science and efforts to improve standards and oversight			1
but @entity154 does not think the release of the report should be an occasion to " put down the work of thousands of scientists and forensic examiners			2
" @entity154 , who also served on the @entity13 panel that produced the report , told @entity1 " the great majority of labs are doing first - rate work top to bottom , and make an enormous contribution to public safety			2
" the study by the @entity13 was requested by @entity60			2
the panel has no authority to institute changes in the nation 's forensics labs , but @entity60 could act to implement its recommendations .			0
