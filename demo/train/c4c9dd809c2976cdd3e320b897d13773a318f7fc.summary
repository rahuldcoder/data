-- on tuesday , two @entity2 appeals courts issued conflicting rulings on a subject that 's important to millions of people : the availability of subsidies to help purchase coverage under the health - care law			1
q : what did the courts decide ? a : in a blow to the health law , the @entity13 ruled that the health law 's subsidies are available only to individuals in the 14 states and the @entity20 now operating their own health insurance exchanges			1
the federal government now runs the exchanges in 36 states			1
judge @entity25 , writing the majority opinion in the 2 - 1 decision , said they concluded " that the @entity29 unambiguously restricts " the subsidies to " exchanges ' established by the state			1
' " in a separate ruling , a three - judge panel for the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , ruled unanimously for the @entity39 administration , allowing subsidies to be available to residents in all states			1
judge @entity44 , writing the opinion , said while the health law is " ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations , " the court decided to uphold the @entity49 's interpretation of the law that residents of states using the federal exchange are entitled to subsidies			1
@entity55 revises contraception opt out q : what was the issue the courts decided on ? a : the case centers on a brief description in the health law that says subsidies will be available " through an exchange established by the state			1
" in implementing the law , the @entity49 interpreted the law to allow eligible consumers to receive subsidies to help purchase coverage , regardless of whether they are in an exchange run by their state or by the federal government			1
opponents of the law questioned that interpretation , saying that the law as written clearly directs subsidies to state - based exchanges only			1
but proponents -- including several lawmakers who helped write it -- said lawmakers fully intended that subsidies be offered on all exchanges no matter if they were administered by the feds or state officials			1
q i do n't know if my state runs its own exchange			0
which states do ? a : @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity20 and the @entity20 all run their own exchanges			2
@entity108 and @entity109 intend to set up their own marketplace for the next enrollment period , which begins in november , but used @entity113 this year			0
@entity114 poll : is @entity29 working ? q : i live in a state with a federally run exchange , and i get a subsidy to help me buy coverage			1
am i going to lose it ? a : nothing is happening immediately			0
@entity124 officials said tuesday they plan to seek an en banc review from the @entity126 , meaning that the panel 's full contingent of 11 judges would hear the case			0
six of the court 's judges would have to agree for the full panel to review the case			0
the full panel is dominated by judges appointed by @entity136 , 7 - 4			0
eventually the case could be considered by the @entity137 , but the current subsidies would likely remain in place until there is a final legal decision on the matter			1
" in the meantime , to be clear , people getting premium tax credits should know that nothing has changed ; tax credits remain available , " said @entity143 , deputy director of the @entity124 's office of public affairs			0
@entity55 spokesman @entity151 said the administration was confident it would prevail			0
" you do n't need a fancy legal degree to understand that @entity155 intended for every eligible @entity2 to have access to tax credits that would lower their health care costs , regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials who were running the marketplace			2
" supporters of the court challenge to the @entity49 interpretation on subsidies also maintain their case is strong			2
" the executive branch does not get to rewrite statutes just because it thinks those statutes would work better a certain way , " said @entity168 , director of health policy studies at the libertarian @entity170 who championed the subsidy appeals			0
" if people lose those subsidies it is because the courts have ruled that those subsidies are and always have been unlawful -- that the administration had no authority to administer those in the first place			2
" q : are these the only two court cases ? a : no. there are two other similar cases pending in courts in @entity191 and @entity192			2
q : if there are legal disputes ongoing about who qualifies to receive a subsidy , do i still have to buy health insurance ? a : yes			0
the law 's " individual mandate , " which requires most people to purchase health insurance or pay a fine , is still in place			0
q. what if i get my insurance through work ? a : this decision applies only to policies sold on the online marketplaces			2
it does not affect work - based insurance , @entity215 or @entity216 , regardless of where you live			0
@entity219 : the impact on 4.7 million @entity2 @entity0 is an editorially independent program of the @entity0 .			0

two courts made conflicting rulings on @entity29 subsidies this week
one court said subsidies are only available for state - run insurance exchanges
other court said subsidies should apply for federal exchanges too
decision will likely go to the @entity137
