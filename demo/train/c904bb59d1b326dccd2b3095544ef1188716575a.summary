@entity0 -- disgraced @entity3 politician @entity2 has confounded expectations by delivering a cool , considered denial of charges leveled against him during a keenly - anticipated corruption trial that has captivated @entity3			1
so far , the public has heard more details of the case than many anticipated			2
live tweets from the court house in @entity15 , @entity16 , are now being followed by more than 460,000 people and this number is expected to rise			1
after the first full day of testimony , @entity1 asked prominent @entity3 analyst @entity20 , from the @entity21 in @entity22 , for his thoughts on how and why the trial has veered so dramatically off - script			1
@entity1 : before @entity2 's trial , many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that does n't appear to be the case			1
what has been the most surprising twist ? @entity20 : there were two surprises			1
one is that @entity2 has rejected all allegations so far , and said he " unwillingly " accepted the charge when he was being questioned by the central disciplinary commission investigation team			1
the second surprise is that the prosecution has performed very poorly in trying to make a strong case against him ; it seems to be falling apart			1
all of a sudden , in my view , @entity2 has decided not to cooperate , but not completely			1
because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems ; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most			2
@entity1 : did @entity2 and his legal team wrong - foot the leadership ? li : @entity2 as a person , as a leader , is unpredictable			1
if you reviewed his career he always surprised people			2
he has always played the wildcard			0
it will be the authorities ' problem if they did n't prepare for that			0
when you have a semi-open trial you need to prepare			2
there 's a lot of praise in @entity3 social media for the judge for his professional manner , but the prosecutors are terrible			1
@entity2 has rejected virtually everything in a very effective way			1
but that means even the leadership ca n't rely too much on the promises or deals made by @entity2			1
@entity1 : do you think a deal was done before the trial and does that appear to be unraveling ? li : of course there would have been deals made before , otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges			2
the deal is they dropped some of the most severe charges against him			0
if you look at september 28 when they arrested him and expelled him from the @entity90 -- there were about six or seven charges , including obstruction of justice and womanizing and , probably most importantly , during the investigation of the murder of @entity98 they allegedly found some other criminal activities			2
in july , they put forward only three charges : bribery , corruption and abuse of power			0
@entity1 : what 's the problem for the leadership strategy to focus on corruption ? @entity2 was the wrong person to focus on corruption because he was famous for being anti-corruption during his tenure in @entity109			1
and relatively speaking , at least in people 's perception , he 's not that corrupted			0
he made a lot of people nervous about his self - promotion campaign -- that 's the real reason , not about corruption			0
@entity2 's real ambition is not about the money			1
he wants to be a top leader , or the top leader			0
by that time the whole country would be his			0
that 's the fundamental dilemma for the leadership			0
now the leadership is in an awkward position -- the charges of corruption will not resonate too well and they ca n't go back to the other charges			0
so what kind of verdict will they give him ? certainly it will not be too severe			0
if it 's too lenient they 'll receive other serious criticism so it 's really a no - win situation for the leadership			0
@entity1 : what do you think the reaction will be in the leadership after this " change of script " ? li : if you follow the reaction in @entity3 most people think that @entity2 did well , including people who really do not like him			1
in my view he was clear , focused , articulate and eloquent			1
some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did			0
i think the authorities ' case is not in good shape on day one			0
@entity1 : has the leadership 's tactic backfired ? could @entity2 have gained more support than he 's lost in the past 24 hours ? li : absolutely			1
there are a lot of rumors that he was very emotional and out of control in jail			0
but he presented himself very well			0
he was very respectful , reasonable , had a human touch , he cared about @entity163 , he cared about its people			0
he claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys			0
he made a clear cut with his wife ; blamed many things on his wife , especially the things that he claimed he did not know			2
also , his defense lawyer did an excellent job to use very clear language to undermine a lot of the accusations			2
@entity2 and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise , in many ways			1
@entity1 : did you find it surprising that he seemed to turn on his wife , @entity183 ? li : a line has been drawn			2
his defense lawyer kept emphasizing her unstable mental status and most of the people in @entity3 believe that			1
if you look at the pictures before her arrest and in the court , it looks like there 's a problem			0
of course the prosecution did n't buy that , but when people judge , at least the civilian people , they buy that argument			2
so @entity2 has successfully drawn a line between him and his wife and used it to undermine her testimony			1
@entity1 : there was a lot of talk when the scandal emerged -- and in subsequent months -- that the case would shake - up @entity3 politics			1
is it that the case , or will it be business as usual after the verdict ? li : the @entity2 case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse			2
so this case already has a strong impact			0
in 18 months a lot has changed ; there 's been a leadership succession , @entity228 's retirement , and the princelings have consolidated their power			0
the leadership wants to move forward			0
they want to put it behind them and move onto other issues			0
that strategy , although it 's rational , will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system			0
@entity1 : given the apparent troubled nature of the prosecution 's case , is there any chance @entity2 could be in the 0.1 % of @entity3 suspects not convicted at trial ? li : of course he will be convicted , otherwise it would be disastrous			1
but the sentencing now ca n't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they 've conducted this trial			1
so there are difficulties for the prosecution unless there are dramatic twists and turns in the following days			1
i think certainly the sentencing wo n't be the death penalty , probably not even the death penalty commuted to life			2
the worst is probably the life sentence , and the most lenient probably 15 years .			0

@entity3 expert @entity20 : @entity2 trial takes number of surprising turns
@entity3 politician has rejected allegations , prosecution has performed poorly
@entity2 appeared " clear , focused , articulate and eloquent , " @entity20 said
trial is expected to take two days with sentencing *due* in september
