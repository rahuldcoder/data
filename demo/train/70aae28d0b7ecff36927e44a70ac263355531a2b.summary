editor 's note : @entity2 is executive director of the @entity4 , an independent intelligence and security think tank based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
his son , @entity9 , is director for international security at the foundation			2
they provide analysis to the media , government agencies and military departments			2
@entity2 , left , and @entity9 say the attacks had the hallmarks of a transnational group			1
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity20 ) -- the @entity22 media have described the @entity24 terrorist siege as @entity22 's 9/11			1
the targets for the attacks , many of them symbols of @entity24 's growing power and wealth , were not randomly selected and were intended to send a direct message to @entity22 , @entity32 and the @entity33			1
indeed , the @entity24 attacks had all the hallmarks of a powerful transnational terrorist group inspired by the ideology of @entity38			1
@entity24 is no stranger to terrorism			2
on march 12 , 1993 , a series of 15 bombs exploded across several districts of @entity22 's financial capital , killing 257			1
on july 11 , 2006 , a coordinated bombing spree on the city 's transportation system killed 209 people			2
uniquely disturbing about the recent @entity24 attacks , in addition to killing locals , is the deliberate targeting of restaurants and hotels used by @entity55 and a @entity57 cultural center			1
@entity24 is to @entity22 as @entity58 is to the @entity59 or @entity7 to the @entity60			1
the city is driving @entity22 's economic boom			1
it is the commercial and entertainment capital of the country , where the " @entity67 " film industry is based			0
it is the heartbeat of @entity22			2
what happens there vibrates throughout the nation			0
three factors may help explain the timing of the attacks			2
first , they occurred on the eve of @entity59 's @entity76 , as hotels in @entity24 were preparing for the event by putting on functions for the @entity59 living , working and on vacation in @entity24			1
secondly , a major international cricket tournament , the @entity81 , was going to take place the following week			0
some of the matches were going to be played in @entity24 , but the attacks resulted in the tournament being postponed			1
thirdly , important state elections are taking place in parts of the country			0
they are being closely contested between the major political parties , and security was a key election issue			0
the events in @entity24 have left the nation divided as to how to respond			2
in fact , in the past 12 months , / topics / @entity22 " class = " cnninlinetopic " > @entity22 has endured more terrorist attacks in more parts of the country than in any previous recorded period			1
cities such as @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and the capital , @entity108 , have been hit			0
however , those attacks involved rudimentary timed - explosives left in public places			0
the latest events are different in terms of method and scale , with cells of well - armed men involved in synchronized assaults			0
the gunmen were also clearly prepared to die in their attacks but not to kill themselves as suicide bombers do			2
they were on a " fedayeen " mission			0
in effect , they were hoping to kill as many people as possible while being taken down in a hail of bullets by the security forces in the ensuing shootout			0
fedayeen attacks are not uncommon in @entity22			1
on december 13 , 2001 , five gunmen drove into @entity22 's parliament complex in @entity108 and opened fire indiscriminately			1
although no members of parliament were harmed , eight people and the five terrorists were killed			0
@entity139 , a @entity140 - based terrorist group affiliated with @entity38 , was blamed for that attack			1
the incident almost brought @entity22 and @entity140 into a full - scale conflict , but that was averted by the intervention of the @entity59 , @entity146 and @entity147			2
although the @entity139 is banned in the @entity59 and the @entity148 , it has tried to operate under different names , including @entity139 and @entity150			0
@entity22 authorities are accusing the group of being tied to the recent attacks in @entity24			1
however , @entity140 authorities deny there is a connection to their country			0
some have suggested the @entity24 attacks can not have a transnational connection because @entity38 uses the tactic of suicide bombers and does not indulge in hostage - taking			1
it is pertinent to point out that @entity38 does not have a written constitution in how to kill , but the end goal is always the same : inflict mass - casualty atrocities with economic , political and social consequences			2
in any case , @entity169 , the @entity170 terrorist who officially aligned his group to @entity38 , graphically introduced the tactic of hostage - taking in @entity175			1
@entity59 journalist @entity176 was taken hostage in @entity178 , @entity140 , and eventually murdered under the order of @entity180 , @entity38 's master planner of 9/11			1
the march 11 , 2004 , train bombings in @entity182 , @entity183 , which killed 190 people , were not suicide attacks nor orchestrated by @entity38 central , but its doctrine certainly motivated the plotters			1
likewise , although @entity38 may not have directly planned and coordinated the @entity24 attacks , the gunmen were clearly inspired by the goals and ideology that @entity191 and his deputy @entity192 preach			1
it could be argued that @entity24 was targeted by the terrorists because other places in the @entity33 have proved harder to attack			1
@entity59 counterterrorism agencies have stepped up efforts since 9/11			0
@entity60 services have foiled plots linked to @entity38 since the 2005 transportation bombings , and @entity32 has significantly reduced the plethora of suicide attacks it once faced			1
the @entity24 gunmen were well - prepared and trained			1
the terrorists had done their reconnaissance and planning , which would have taken months to coordinate			0
they knew the terrain and locations			0
they had worked out the internal infrastructure and layout of the buildings and moved with stealth , combing their way through 10 locations and creating devastation along the way			0
unlike most terrorist attacks of recent years , the @entity24 siege lingered primarily because the gunmen had taken hostages			1
the focus of the international community remained fixated on events in @entity24 with wall - to - wall coverage from the world 's media			1
unlike suicide bombing , hostage - taking can be played out over several days			0
terrorists have become skilled in using the media as their oxygen of publicity to convey fear and inflict paralysis			0
understandably , some have questioned how , if official estimates are accurate , 10 terrorists could have caused so much bloodshed and repelled @entity22 's security apparatus for more than three days in three different buildings			1
the challenge for the authorities was to eliminate the terrorists and not the hostages			0
the gunmen had embedded themselves in the buildings and were well - equipped and able to return fire and lob grenades at the @entity22 forces trying to clinically extract them			1
it 's worth remembering that on 9/11 , it took only 19 people , with only box cutters as their weapons , to hijack four commercial flights			2
with basic flight training , they used three of those planes as guided missiles into the @entity263 and the @entity264			0
as has been demonstrated in the @entity59 , the @entity60 and @entity183 , it is easier for terrorists to operate and function in a free and democratic society			0
for counterterrorism authorities , foiling potential attacks is like an uphill treadmill			0
they have to be 100 percent successful all the time			0
the terrorists only need to be lucky once in order to inflict a mass casualty attack			0
cities become huge because they are successful in economic terms			0
people migrate because they feel they would have better opportunities there			0
the total population of @entity24 is 18.5 million , and it is a city growing in economic terms every year , which gives the national economy huge momentum			2
direct foreign investment helps build commercial relations with other countries , and it is this relationship the terrorists seem keen to disrupt and damage permanently			0
in the long - term , it is unlikely the @entity22 economy will be deflected by terrorism anymore than @entity295 economies have been fundamentally weakened by terror in @entity58 or @entity7 , so the attack may not undermine the commercial fabric of the city			2
but it will leave deep indelible scars for @entity24 residents			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity9 .			0

@entity305 : some in the media are calling @entity24 attacks @entity22 's 9/11
they say attacks bore signs of transnational group inspired by @entity38
@entity24 siege lingered primarily because gunmen had taken hostages , @entity305 say
@entity24 may have been targeted *due* to *higher* security elsewhere , they say
