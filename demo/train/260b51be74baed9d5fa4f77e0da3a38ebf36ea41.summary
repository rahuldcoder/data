@entity0 -- it 's been true since the @entity3 first took flight : bad plane accidents can lead to good safety improvements			1
a deadly fire on an @entity10 flight in 1983 , for instance , led to lavatory smoke detectors			2
and the in - flight rupture of an @entity14 fuselage five years later led to increased scrutiny of aging aircraft			2
but what will be the legacy of @entity19 , which crashed one year ago this weekend ? @entity1 talked to safety experts and combed @entity22 records for lessons learned in the @entity25 crash			1
man vs. machine in pilot lounges and aviation blogs , the verdict is in : @entity25 's pilots screwed up			1
the crew over-relied on automation , unintentionally disabled the plane 's auto - throttle , did not pay attention to the plane 's slowing speed , and failed at basic piloting skills			1
that opinion is shared by the @entity22			2
last month , the board concluded that the @entity19 crash resulted from the " crew 's mismanagement of the airplane 's descent " into @entity47			1
it outlined a series of mistakes that led to the crash , which killed three teenage girls and seriously injured 49 of the 307 people aboard			0
in layman 's language , @entity19 was caused by pilot error			1
but to blame the accident solely on pilot error is to miss the real lesson of @entity19 , past and present @entity22 leaders say			1
the " one change that i would like to see : improving the human - machine interface , " said former @entity22 chairman @entity63 , who oversaw the crash investigation			0
" the @entity25 crash involved an inherently safe aircraft that performed as designed and a very experienced crew , " @entity63 said			1
" but it demonstrated that commercial pilots are trained to rely heavily on sophisticated automation , which can become a trap if they do n't understand what the system is doing behind the control panel			1
" at a december hearing , the safety board heard evidence that the @entity25 pilots were confused by autopilot modes , believing the auto - throttle would maintain the plane 's speed			1
" automation has unquestionably made aviation safer and more efficient			1
but the more complex automation becomes , the more challenging it is to ensure that the pilots adequately understand it , " current safety board acting chairman @entity87 said last month			1
" in this instance , the flight crew over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand			1
as a result , they flew the aircraft too low and too slow and collided with the seawall at the end of the runway			0
" the @entity22 ruled that " complexities of the auto - throttle and autopilot " systems contributed to the accident			0
it recommended that @entity108 revise the @entity110 's operating manual to prevent confusion about the auto - pilot modes			1
@entity108 says it 's faultless " @entity108 respectfully disagrees with the @entity22 's statement that the 777 's auto - flight system contributed to this accident , " it said in a statement			1
" the auto - flight system has been used successfully for over 200 million flight hours across several airplane models , and for more than 55 million safe landings , " it said			0
" all the airplane 's systems performed as designed			1
" @entity108 said it will review the @entity22 's recommendations			1
@entity125 aeronautics professor @entity124 said the most likely outcome of the @entity19 crash : " an increased focus on pilot training to maintain basic piloting skills and not become too dependent on automation			1
" emergency response experts say first responders performed heroically in racing to the damaged aircraft and removing trapped occupants			0
but about half of the @entity22 's recommendations involve suggestions to improve emergency responses			2
improvement is needed in coordination and communications , said @entity143 , professor of aviation at aerospace at @entity146			2
" i kind of relate it to putting a lot of all - stars on the field , but not have a common game plan			0
" during the @entity19 response , an incident commander placed an officer who had not received aircraft firefighting training in charge , the @entity22 said			0
no injuries could be attributed to the officer , it noted			0
the airport fire department also had two vehicles equipped with turrets that could pierce a plane 's fuselage			1
but while the @entity164 had given guidance on how to pierce a fuselage , it had not given guidance on when to pierce a plane , the @entity22 said			2
and two emergency medical buses failed to arrive at the scene , the @entity22 said			0
the buses were not physically deployed during monthly drills , the board said , likely playing a role in the failure to use them during the crash			0
" it 's those types of things you need to exercise , so that when it 's game time , you understand the realities of what you have to do , " @entity143 said			2
" i think it 's up to the @entity164 to raise the standards for airports , " he said			2
the safety board said the airport initially deployed seven vehicles to the crash , exceeding the @entity164 - required minimum of three vehicles			0
and some 23 rescuers were initially deployed , though the @entity164 has no minimum staffing level			0
that means victims of crashes at smaller airports " may not be afforded the same level of protection that the passengers of flight 214 had , " the board said			0
what went right experts say the crash could have been much worse ; passengers benefited from safety improvements			0
" i 've watched that ( crash ) video time and again , " @entity143 said			0
" the structural integrity of that plane remained amazingly intact for what it went through			2
it protected the occupants very well			0
" " if there 's anything good to be had from all the accidents in the past and all the lives lost , it 's made for amazing changes in the design of an aircraft , " @entity143 said			2
the main landing gear sheared away from the wings , by design			0
passenger seats withstood the brutal g - forces			0
luggage bins did not fall on the passengers or block their evacuation			0
the jet fuel did not erupt on impact			0
and when a fire finally broke out -- the result of leaking oil from the plane 's right engine , which came to rest next to the fuselage -- it did not spread quickly			1
fifteen minutes passed before black smoke was seen pouring from the plane 's left door			1
authorities note that 99 % of the plane 's occupants survived -- a rate that would have seemed impossible only a decade or two ago			1
indeed , two of the three deaths may have been avoidable , the @entity22 said			0
two girls ejected from the plane had not buckled their seatbelts , investigators said , and likely would have survived if they had			2
a fire truck rolled over one of the ejected girls in the chaos of the crash scene			0
the third girl had on a seatbelt , but died at the hospital six days later of injuries suffered in the crash			0
a year later , survivors recall @entity19 crash pilots blamed for @entity25 crash			1

in pilot lounges and aviation blogs , the verdict is in : @entity25 's pilots screwed up
the crew over-relied on automation
it also did not pay attention to the plane 's slowing speed
