rowdy scenes erupted at the main @entity2 protest site in @entity3 on monday after hundreds of people opposing the pro-democracy occupation tried to tear down protest barricades			1
police formed a human chain to separate the protesters and people intent on breaking up their three - week long occupation of the @entity12 district , near the city 's financial center			1
dozens of men , some wearing surgical masks , were seen jostling with protesters and demanding that police remove the barricades and clear the roads , according to live images from local television station @entity22			1
they were heard screaming at protesters , accusing them of damaging their livelihoods			0
the television commentator identified them as taxi drivers , transport industry workers and other people who said they were n't affiliated with any groups			2
however , protesters could be heard yelling , " there are triads here , " a reference to criminal gangs in the city known for controlling smuggling , prostitution and illegal gambling rings			2
police on loudspeakers called for calm , and eventually convinced protesters to form a corridor to allow their opponents to leave			0
earlier , police started to remove barricades from protest sites in @entity12 and @entity48 , but issued a statement saying they were moving " obstacles " to relieve traffic " not to clear the scene			1
" police " pushed back a couple of barricades , dismantling them , " said @entity55 's @entity54 , from the @entity57 protest site			1
he said the protesters had responded by moving their tents closer to the barrier but the streets had remained peaceful			0
protest disruption at the peak of the protests , which started in late september , tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto the streets demanding a greater say in how the city is run			1
protesters have been guarding barricades erected at the protest sites , and for many nights slept in the open air on bitumen before the arrival of reinforcements with tents on the weekend			1
traffic in the other parts of the city has been clogged due to road closures , bus and tram cancellations and the need for cars to drive around the protest sites			1
taxi drivers say their takings are down , and businesses have claimed the protests have cost them income			2
while protest numbers dwindled towards the end of last week , they started building again over the weekend when protest leaders called for reinforcements after the government called off talks planned for friday			2
first live address over the weekend , @entity3 chief executive @entity100 made his first live address since protesters blocked key routes through the city			1
speaking on local free - to - air station @entity106 , @entity100 said the protests were not a " revolution , " but a " mass movement that has spun out of control			1
" he said student leaders had " almost zero chance " of pushing @entity113 to chance its stance on how @entity3 's leader is elected			0
he added he would not accede to the protesters ' demands that he resign , because his resignation " will not solve the problem			0
" " it is because the students and other occupation protesters demand more than that			0
they want the @entity124 to withdraw its august 31 decision			0
that is impossible , " he said			0
@entity113 white paper he was referring to the white paper issued by the @entity124 of @entity131 's @entity130 stating that @entity3 would be able to vote on their leader in 2017 , but only from an approved shortlist of candidates			2
in response to @entity100 's comments , the three main groups leading the occupy campaign said it was the government that was out of control -- " a government that fires tear - gas at unarmed citizens and unilaterally terminated dialogue with the students ( sic )			1
" on september 28 , police fired 87 tear gas rounds into the crowd after protesters failed to disperse			0
the move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech			0
open letter to @entity131 over the weekend , student leaders from protest group @entity156 and the @entity157 wrote an open letter to @entity131 president @entity159 , urging him to closely consider their cause			1
" there will only be more citizens , disillusioned with our corrupted institutions , marching and protesting , as long as no genuine democracy is practiced in this place , " they wrote			0
the letter said the occupation was " definitely not a colour revolution or its alike , but rather a movement for democracy , " referring to the term " umbrella revolution " which was coined after protesters used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray and tear gas			1
view from @entity131 @entity159 has not commented on the protests , but @entity131 censors have been busy blocking reports of the movement , including access to the photo - sharing site @entity184			1
a commentary published in @entity131 's state - controlled @entity186 on monday , entitled " why is the @entity187 so keen on @entity189 ? " , accused the @entity187 of meddling in @entity3 affairs			2
" it is hardly likely that the @entity187 will admit to manipulating the " @entity2 " movement , just as it will not admit to manipulating other @entity193 forces			0
it sees such activities as justified by " democracy , " " freedom , " " human rights " and other values , " it said			0
it said the mainstream @entity187 media had shown " exceptional interest " in " @entity2 " and had tried to portray it as @entity3 's version of a " @entity189 , " referring to pro-democracy movements around the world including the " @entity207 " and @entity209 's " @entity208			0
" " the @entity187 may enjoy the sweet taste of interfering in other countries ' internal affairs , but on the issue of @entity3 it stands little chance of overcoming the determination of the @entity131 government to maintain stability and prosperity , " it added .			2
