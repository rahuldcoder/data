@entity0 -- in rural southern @entity4 , 14 - term @entity3 rep. @entity2 says he 's never had an election enemy quite like the ones he 's facing this year			1
its not his opponent , but instead it 's what he calls a " shadowy " group that is funding television ads against him			1
" @entity2 is trying to deceive you ... @entity2 has failed to protect our jobs			0
now it 's time @entity2 loses his , " the ad 's narrator says			2
the 30 - second commercial was paid for by @entity21 , a conservative - leaning group which , according to the nonpartisan watchdog group @entity22 , has spent nearly $ 8 million against @entity3 candidates nationwide			1
on its website , @entity24 for @entity25 states that its members are " businesses , business leaders and entrepreneurs from around the country , " but blatantly states it will not disclose the names of its individual members or donors			1
@entity2 , who says he 's spent $ 300,000 of his campaign funds to counter the ad , rails against the secretive nature of the organization			2
" we have no idea who these individuals are , " @entity2 said			0
" it could be someone who has a corporate identity in the @entity24			0
it could be a very wealthy individual who has some grudge against me and is putting this advertisement on the air as a consequence			0
" @entity21 identifies itself on its website as a @entity56 ( 6 ) business league			0
that 's a tax status for a nonprofit operation that can be involved in politics but not as its primary purpose			2
this particular tax status also means it does not have to disclose its donors			2
read @entity65 regulations on 501 ( c ) ( 6 ) business leagues groups such as @entity21 are outside the @entity3 and @entity68 parties and are likely benefiting from a @entity71 decision earlier this year			1
that ruling , made on free speech grounds , allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited money to help defeat or promote candidates			0
that means even watchdog groups that track money flowing through elections ca n't find out who funds the groups			1
" when you 're just trying to figure out who is truly behind that television message that you 're seeing on tv , you do n't know who 's behind it , and that makes it more difficult as a voter to actually have the requisite information to go into the voting booth and make an informed choice , " said @entity85 of @entity22			1
@entity68 sources have told @entity1 that @entity21 has only one full - time employee , @entity100			2
his office is in @entity102 , @entity4 , across the @entity103 from @entity0			0
@entity1 left multiple phone messages for @entity100 , but he did not return the calls			0
conservative - leaning outside groups have already spent $ 121.6 million this election season compared with $ 79.1 million spent by liberal - leaning outside groups , according to @entity22			1
another conservative group , @entity110 , expects to raise and spend about $ 35 million this election			0
" we simply educate the public , " said @entity111 , the group 's president			1
part of that money is funding a television ad running in @entity118 targeting first - term @entity3 rep. @entity119 , which says , " to small businesses , @entity119 is the same as @entity122			1
" who are @entity110 's donors ? the @entity127 billionaire @entity126 brothers are the group 's founders and give significant dollars			1
but besides them , it 's unclear			0
@entity111 also makes no apologies for not revealing donors			0
" most of it is private individuals , but we 're glad to have their support and we do tell them , ' look we 're going to protect your privacy as the law allows us to do			0
' " president @entity139 has made it a regular practice lately to call out @entity110 by name in his effort to attack outside groups for spending tens of millions against @entity3 without disclosing donors			1
" they are now allowed to spend as much as they want , unlimited amounts of money , and they do n't have to reveal who is paying for these ads , " @entity139 said at a recent @entity3 fundraiser			1
" millions of dollars being spent by groups with harmless - sounding names , @entity110 , the @entity156 , or @entity157			1
" @entity111 said the president 's attacks have actually helped @entity110 raise more money			2
" if the president wants to use us as a punching bag , let him , " he said			0
" it does help funding , and it helps generate new grassroots support			0
" despite tough talk from @entity139 targeting @entity68 - backed outside groups , it 's a mutual election - year undertaking			1
@entity3 have their own groups supporting them , such as @entity171 and @entity172 , which are not disclosing their donors			1
in @entity175 , where former rep. @entity176 is running for his old seat , @entity171 is running an ad against him			0
as eerie music plays in the background the narrator says , " congressman @entity176 , named one of the most corrupt members of @entity184			0
" in @entity185 , @entity172 is running an ad promoting @entity3 sen. @entity187			2
and @entity3 have smaller outside groups aimed at getting @entity3 voters to the polls			1
our @entity191 was originally started by veteran union strategist @entity193			0
this year , according to an official familiar with the organization , it is running programs in @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 to encourage @entity3 voters to go the polls			1
they 're targeting @entity204 voters and " drop - off voters , " those who went to the polls for @entity139 in 2008 but may not be likely to return for this year 's midterm election			1
our @entity191 is yet another @entity3 group that does not disclose its donors			1
@entity3 are also using a new weapon in the big money game of politics : the super pac			2
@entity214 work independently of candidates			0
unlike regular political action committees , they can raise and spend unlimited money to try to defeat or promote candidates			0
but super pacs must disclose their donors			0
@entity221 is one of the biggest of these new groups , and it is concentrating its efforts in @entity225 , spending at least $ 5 million so far on ads against senate majority leader @entity228 's opponent , @entity68 @entity227			1
the television ad 's narrator begins , " for a victim of rape or incest , @entity227 would force her to have the baby			0
" the ad then plays audio of @entity238			0
" two wrongs do n't make a right			0
" @entity241 , a longtime @entity3 strategist who runs @entity221 , told @entity1 his group will significantly step up spending in the final three weeks before the election			1
@entity241 expects to raise and spend as much as $ 10 million on the @entity228 race and other key @entity3 races around the country			2
@entity241 says his group is funded mostly by labor unions , in - state individual supporters and nonunion progressive groups , but he did not provide the names of these groups			1
watchdog organizations say transparency is still a problem with these groups			2
" they do n't have to do it [ reveal donors ] in real time , " said @entity85 of @entity22			2
" if they put a television ad up , there 's no disclaimer at the end of the advertisement saying that this ad was paid for by these different corporations or these different unions			0
" in fact , since @entity221 raised most of its money in the past few months , recent @entity272 filings do n't reveal the majority of its donors			2
@entity221 's third quarter @entity272 filing is due this week -- three weeks before the election -- and will list the more recent donors			2
" @entity280 laments that @entity3 are lagging behind @entity68 efforts to use these new political identities to raise large sums of money			1
" they are @entity287 , and we are @entity289 , " he said			0
" we are fighting back , and we 're going to use the slingshot that we have in order to fight this fight			0
" another super pac is @entity294			0
it 's an outside group organized primarily by a @entity3 insider , who once headed up @entity3 efforts to elect members to @entity184			1
he helped start the group five weeks ago to compete with @entity68			0
and although @entity294 is required to disclose who funds it , @entity1 is told that the group itself was one of the secret donors to the @entity171 in its ad against @entity176			2
it is a hard trail to follow , which underscores the point that @entity3 , too , are trying to play carefully in what the president calls a shadowy world			1
in fact , while @entity294 may be a super pac that must disclose its donors , it has a sister organization , @entity313 , which does not			0
multiple @entity3 sources tell @entity1 there is great frustration in some @entity3 circles with the president 's attacks on @entity68 groups			1
these sources say the president has made it harder to persuade @entity3 donors to contribute to their outside groups , which for better or worse , are emerging as significant players in this year 's election .			1

political groups operate outside parties and do not have to reveal members or donors
it 's difficult for voters to figure out who is behind messaging , watchdog group says
president @entity139 has attacked groups for spending millions without disclosing donors
@entity3 - leaning groups are also *cloaking* their funding sources , however
