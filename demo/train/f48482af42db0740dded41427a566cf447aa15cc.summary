-- the length of the @entity2 is constantly changing			1
in 2010 the @entity2 was officially 2,179.1 miles long			1
this year it 's 2,181			1
in 2004 it was 2,173.9			2
the added distance is due to upgrades and repairs			2
( not because your group had to backtrack a half - day because one of you left the keys to the vehicle parked at the end of the section in the vehicle parked at the start of the section			2
) the @entity2 stretches from @entity19 , in north @entity20 , to @entity21 , in central @entity22 , crossing 14 states and five national parks			1
the route is marked by white blazes on trees , posts and rocks			0
it 's possible to hike the @entity2 without a tent			1
there are more than 250 garage - size shelters " roughly a day 's hike apart " along the length of the @entity2 , according to @entity36 of the @entity37 , the nonprofit corporation that leads efforts to maintain the trail			1
that 's a shelter about every 8 miles on average			1
so " thru - hikers , " people who walk the full distance in a continuous hike , often leave the tent at home , saving as much as 5 pounds from their backpacks			1
that 's good , because that " day 's hike " can be up to 30 miles , since shelters are built near sources of fresh water , @entity36 said			1
what 's in an @entity2 hiker 's backpack ? you wo n't see nearly as many animals as you 'd expect			1
that 's because most can hear , see or smell you long before you hear , see or smell them , and they 'll flee			1
in the case of bears , wild pigs , raccoons and snakes , that 's good			1
on hikes from @entity20 through @entity72 , i have seen hundreds of birds , chipmunks and squirrels , spiders , a few deer , two wild turkeys as big as a washer and dryer , a wild pig , the backside of a bear running into the brush , and a rattlesnake lying across the trail warming itself in the morning sun. ( @entity89 : it 's less upsetting for all involved to hike around a timber rattler than to try to encourage it to move on by bouncing even a small stone off it			1
) not wearing your glasses increases the number of animal sightings			0
but keep in mind that while without your glasses a tree stump can look like a bear , a bear also can look like a tree stump			0
but you might experience mice -- and it will be your fault			0
they congregate at shelters to feast on scraps left by hikers who do n't follow the no. 1 rule of the @entity2 : leave no trace			1
and do n't think that stowing your food in your pack means it 's safe			1
we were awakened one night by a mouse that had gnawed through the pocket of a backpack and was wrestling with the wrapper of a snack bar inside			0
that 's why shelters have ropes to hang packs up and away from small critters			1
some also have " bear boxes , " lockers that keep food safe from larger beasts			0
the alternative is to hang your food in a stuff - sack from the branch of a tree			0
most of the @entity2 is strewn with rocks			1
that makes sense , since the @entity2 , for the most part , follows the ridge of the @entity141			1
still , it seems there are more rocks on the trail than off the trail			1
a running joke among our hiking group was that if you lose the trail , look for rocks ; it 'll be there			2
there are rocks you must climb over , rocks that stick out from the ground to slam your toes into or trip over , irregular rocks that force you to use foot and leg muscles to maintain balance with each step and rocks covered with mud or muck that are as slick as ice			0
it 's a good idea to stow anything breakable , like a smartphone , at the top or to the back of your pack to keep it from breaking when you fall on your rear end			2
downhill is worse than uphill			0
hiking uphill carrying 20 - 30 pounds is strenuous , especially when it 's a half - mile climb up large rocks			2
you 've sweated out so much salt and potassium that you 're experiencing the onset of hyponatremia , a condition in which you have difficulty using your muscles and may even experience some confusion ( different from " why am i doing this ? what was i thinking ? " which are coherent thoughts )			0
resting and a salty snack with water help			0
but on a steep downhill , your knee takes more impact			0
after some distance , each step is painful			0
trekking poles and walking slowly can ease some of the discomfort			0
but knee damage is possible			0
an estimated 12,000 people have hiked the full length of the @entity2 since it was completed in 1937			1
the @entity37 's @entity36 says it usually takes from five to seven months			2
the numbers are derived from sign - in sheets at either end of the trail and at conservancy headquarters at the unofficial midway point in @entity211 , @entity212 , as well as from " ridge runners , " who keep an eye on logbooks at shelters in their area			2
but there is no requirement to sign in or out , and many do n't			0
" so who knows what the variable is ? " @entity36 said			0
those who have hiked the @entity2 " know they 've done it , " @entity36 said			1
hikers usually are known by " trail names " they give themselves or earn , like @entity230 ( see " downhill is worse than uphill " )			2
detailed maps , books and other information about the trail are available through the @entity37 website			2
the trail is maintained by volunteers			1
last year some 6,200 volunteers , led by members of 31 official @entity2 maintaining clubs , worked 210,000 hours repairing trails , painting blazes and maintaining shelters , privies and wells , according to the @entity37			1
the conservancy is staffed by 44 paid workers year - round and 12 to 15 seasonal workers , @entity36 said			2
volunteers often give up some of their vacation so hikers can use some of theirs on the @entity2			1
" @entity2 magic " comes from " trail angels			1
" trail magic is an unexpected act of kindness or generosity			2
it can be as simple as a day hiker giving a thru - hiker a candy bar or as grand as volunteers setting up a grill near a road crossing and passing out hot dogs			2
the little things are missed most			0
@entity272 , aka " @entity274 , " and @entity273 , aka " @entity275 , " are thru - hiking with @entity276 , a @entity277 shepherd , unofficially aka " @entity278 " ( he occasionally chases imaginary threats in the woods , @entity272 said )			0
" we feel an immense appreciation for the simple experiences we rarely get these days , " she e-mailed from the @entity2 somewhere in @entity281			1
" drinking coffee from a mug , having a chair to sit on , dry clothes after a storm			0
... " follow " @entity274 , " " @entity275 " and @entity276 's thru hike			1
one day hiking is better therapy than a year of visits to the shrink			2
after an hour of wisecracks ( " are we there yet ? " " oh , good , more rocks			0
" " did you bring the beer ? " ) as the day 's hike begins , we settle into a quiet time alone in the woods with our thoughts			1
( are we there yet ? oh , good , more rocks			0
i wish i had a beer			0
) it 's also better than a day in the gym			2
at my weight , 127 pounds soaking wet ( which is what i was after a 16 - mile hike in 14 miles of rain ) , carrying a 30 - pound pack burns about 450 calories an hour			1
you can trap thru - hikers with beer			0
" samurai " was planning to catch up with some buddies at the next shelter when he ran into our group at the @entity326 near @entity327 , @entity328			0
we had just come back from a 6 - mile round - trip excursion into town to buy , um , supplies			0
instead of hurrying to his friends , he spent the next few hours sitting with us around the " backpackers ' tv , " roasting marshmallows and singing @entity339 pub songs			0
if a shelter is near enough to a road and to a town , it 's not unusual to see a pizza delivery or two			2
that 's why a smartphone with @entity347 is essential ; you can use it to find towns near the trail and supplies			1
the world is your toilet ... as long as it 's a " cathole " at least 6 inches deep and 200 feet from a trail , campsite or water source			1
please pack out the paperwork or file it away at the site and cover it all with dirt			0
remember : leave no trace			0
the more pleasant of these are composting outhouses , which require users to do a bit of yard work before use			0
they work by adding a handful of dirt after each visit			0
the dirt , called " duff , " is the layer of soil and mold just beneath the layer of leaves on the forest floor .			0
