@entity0 -- justice @entity2 proudly points out a recent empirical study finding her " the least funny justice who talks " when cases are argued on the @entity9 's nine - member bench			1
but the court 's oldest member certainly knows funny and knows the often - austere bench does not always take itself so seriously			1
a warmly humorous speech she gave friday in @entity15 , @entity16 , provided a helpful summary of the past term , which ended last month			0
she even provided a " greatest hits " list of some of the more unusual , even bizarre , quotes from the justices at oral arguments			1
those public sessions are a time for the court to pose hypotheticals and offer their analysis of the case at hand , to help them later reach some sort of binding decision			0
the 78 - year - old @entity2 judiciously said the questions were " rich " in nature			1
let her explain , in her own words : " questions from the bench ranged from the historical : ' what did @entity41 think about video games ? ' ( @entity44 ) to the practical ' is n't evidence always destroyed when marijuana ( once possessed by a suspect ) is smoked ? is n't it being burnt up ? ' " colleagues have been fearful : ' does @entity50 know all this stuff ? ' ( @entity52 ) , occasionally philosophical : ' why are you here ? ' ( @entity54 ) , ' why are we all here ? ' ( @entity56 ) , and sometimes openly exasperated : ' i know your client does n't care			1
but we still have to write ( an opinion )			0
so what 's the answer ? ' ( @entity56 )			2
" queries ran from the natural : ' is the snake covered ? ' ( @entity52 ) to the unnatural : ' where is the 9,000 - foot cow ? ' ( @entity56 ) to the supernatural : ' what do you think about @entity69 ? ' ( @entity52 )			1
" @entity2 added : " from the foregoing samples , you may better understand why the court does not plan to permit televising oral arguments anytime soon			1
" notice too that she did not mention any colorful quotes from herself or her two female colleagues , but she noted that was not a sign they had nothing to say from the bench			1
" we sit left , right and center of the bench , and as transcripts show , @entity52 is getting a run for his title as the justice who asks the most questions			1
" @entity2 told her audience of the " joy " she has found having three women on the court for the first time in history			1
she especially singled out the newest justice , @entity97 , who was sworn in august			2
" she has already shown her talent as an incisive questioner at oral argument , " @entity2 said , " and a writer of eminently readable opinions			1
" among the court 's biggest cases were a ruling against the father of a fallen @entity108			0
a @entity110 - based group , the @entity109 , had picketed @entity113 @entity112 's funeral with graphic anti-homosexual rhetoric			2
the majority said the father could not sue the church since the protesters ' message , however hateful , related to issues of public concern , such as the war in @entity123			0
" @entity127 , we reminded , protects even the most hateful views , " @entity2 told the group of local lawyers in her speech			2
and the high court , in its last ruling of the term , tossed out an @entity134 election reform law that gave additional taxpayer dollars to underfunded candidates who accepted public financing			1
the " matching funds " laws was designed , said its opponents , to " even the playing field " in political campaigns			0
@entity2 and her liberal colleagues dissented , and she commented that it would continue to open the floodgates to uncontrolled corporate spending on elections			2
" all the democracy money can buy , i believe , is not what the @entity127 offers , " she said			0
@entity2 offered no hint she planned to leave the court anytime soon			2
in fact , court sources have said in recent months she plans to stay on for several more years if her health holds up			0
those sources say she just enjoys her job too much to think about retirement			0
in her speech , she noted her @entity16 roots , which she shares with @entity52 ( @entity160 ) , @entity161 ( @entity162 ) and @entity97 ( @entity163 )			0
@entity44 is from neighboring @entity164 , @entity165			0
" with justices now bred in four of @entity16 's five boroughs , should another vacancy arise , " the @entity167 native remarked , " @entity172 jurists should stay close to their phones			0
