@entity0 has spent the better part of her 84 years wondering how her brother died at a @entity4 reform school in 1940 , and where he may be buried			1
today , she appears to be one step closer to finding out			0
@entity4 's attorney general filed a petition on tuesday asking a state court to approve the exhumation of an unknown number of bodies believed to be buried at the now - defunct school in the @entity4 panhandle town of @entity14			1
" the deaths that occurred at @entity20 in @entity14 are cloaked in mystery , and the surviving family members deserve a thorough examination of the site , " stated attorney general @entity15 , who filed the petition on behalf of @entity18 's medical examiner			1
" i am committed to doing everything within my power to support investigative efforts to help resolve unanswered questions and bring closure to the families who lost loved ones			0
" @entity0 -- who believes her brother , @entity32 , was buried on the school 's property -- says she 's overjoyed at the news			1
" we know they 're there and once they start digging , then maybe we can find remains and i hope one of them is my brother , " she told @entity36			0
" i want his remains brought up , and if i get my brother i would be ecstatic			0
" mystery surrounds graves at boys ' reform school it 's unclear when the state court will rule on @entity15 's petition , although a decision could come in the next couple of weeks			1
if the exhumations are approved , the bodies would be examined at the @entity57 at the direction of @entity18 's medical examiner , @entity59			1
forensic investigators hope to start the process before the summer rainy season			2
researchers plan to use @entity64 from surviving family members to help identify the remains and return them to their relatives			0
for years , stories and allegations of beatings , torture and murder have surrounded the century - old school			2
state authorities have said in the past that there were 31 burial sites at the school , and a 2009 state investigation found no wrongdoing in connection with those deaths			1
investigators now say there 's evidence that 98 boys died at the school , and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves that forensic investigators have recently found on school grounds			1
in the wake of those findings , @entity93 sen. @entity92 , @entity4 , asked the @entity96 to investigate			1
@entity92 called @entity15 's petition for exhumations " a critical step forward to bring closure to the families			2
" the mystery surrounding the graves first made headlines in 2008 when @entity4 's then - governor , @entity105 , ordered an investigation after a group of men , known as " the @entity20 , " came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators inside a small , white building on school property			1
@entity115 , who spent about 10 months at the school in the 1960s for allegedly stealing a car , said he was taken to the " white house " on his very first day			0
" i came out of there in shock , and when they hit you , you went down a foot into the bed , and so hard , i could n't believe			0
i did n't know what they were hitting you with , " @entity115 said			0
former school administrator @entity128 , a one - armed man who some former students accused of beating them , has said in a deposition that " spankings " took place at the school but denied anyone was ever beaten or killed			0
the @entity136 's 2009 report said most of the 31 boys buried in the school 's cemetery were killed in a 1914 fire at the facility , while others died in a 1918 flu outbreak			1
at the time , the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried , blaming poorly kept school records			1
@entity136 closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct , and no charges were filed			0
investigators say the records do not explain why the boys were buried on school property in the first place			1
the boys who attended the school were considered " young offenders " of state law and were placed in the school in order to be " separated from older more vicious associates , " according to the 2009 report citing the @entity170 of 1953			1
@entity4 's @entity173 closed the school in 2011 , blaming budget cuts			1
@entity176 said her family was told that her brother @entity32 ran away from the reform school , got pneumonia , and died underneath a house in town			2
" they said that the body was so decomposed , you would n't be able to identify him ... they took him straight out to the school and buried him , " she told @entity36			2
but @entity32 's classmate told the family a different story , @entity0 said			0
according to @entity0 , the boy said as he and @entity32 tried to escape , " my brother was running out across a field , an open field , and there was three men shooting at him , with rifles			0
" " i believe to this day that they shot my brother that night , and i think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him , " she said			2
today , she simply wants to bring him home			0
she 's 84 now , and says she 's running out of time			0
" my mom never got a good night 's sleep the rest of her life after @entity32 went missing , " she said			0
" i 'd make sure he 's put with my mom and dad			2
it will probably be their first good night 's sleep in over 70 years			0

the court could make a decision in the next few weeks
