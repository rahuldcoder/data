@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is the legendary @entity1 musician whose songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid			1
he tells @entity2 about growing up under apartheid , why he left @entity1 and what is was like to move back to @entity0 after 30 years away			1
@entity3 : " the people of @entity1 deserve entertainment , recreation and freedom			1
" @entity2 : how did the suffering of the apartheid influence your art ? @entity3 : i do n't think what i do is influenced by suffering			1
i come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance			0
we have wonderful singers and we have a diversity of music here that is just amazing			0
but in spite of being oppressed these people were very resilient and they were mostly resilient through song			1
i think we are the only society where music played such a major part in our resistance			0
we grew up in rallies and in the street			0
we did n't have televisions so we played in the streets and made up songs about what was happening			1
watch @entity3 take @entity2 on a tour of @entity0 »			1
@entity2 : what 's your earliest memory of @entity0 ? @entity44 : i came to @entity47 ' burg from @entity48 [ a town near @entity0 ]			1
my family moved to @entity51 township and the first time i went to town alone i must have been 10 or 11			0
@entity47 ' burg used to be scrubbed every night with fire hoses and those hard brooms and the granite on the sidewalks would always sparkle			0
i remember that because i came from @entity61 township where there were no lights , no sewage and no cafes			0
the most vivid memory i have -- we used to stop and look through restaurant windows at the white people eating fancy food , and we 'd say " what do you think that is ? " and " there are so many types of food ! " @entity2 : how did it feel to leave @entity1 ? @entity44 : when i left @entity1 in 1960 i was 20 years old			1
i wanted to try to get an education and music education was not available for me in @entity1			1
i wanted to learn from the same kind of teachers that taught @entity80 and @entity81 and @entity82 and they were not in @entity1			1
i hoped that one day i could go and learn some of those things and then come back and teach			0
it was a rough time , when the apartheid government first started showing that if you do n't behave , they 'll shoot you -- women and children too			1
you saw police with guns , with machine guns , and for the first time you saw tanks			0
we had a group called the @entity96 and we were about to take off on a national tour			0
we were the first @entity1 group to play on an lp , but gatherings of more than 10 people were banned so we could n't do our tour			1
but four years later , when i was ready to come back to @entity1 , i could n't			1
by then @entity103 had been sentenced to life imprisonment			0
so i stayed 26 years longer than i planned to			2
see @entity3 's @entity0 » @entity2 : tell us about coming home			1
@entity44 : it was great , but it was also a tense time coming back to @entity1 and we were not naive about it			1
it was a time of real turmoil			0
there were no - go places in the townships , there was sniping , there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening			0
when i left @entity1 there were 10 million people -- when i came back there were more than 40 million			1
i had to learn how to get to the highways because when i left where there were no highways			2
and i had to adjust my language because people would say " we do n't ' talk like that anymore ! " i was like a sponge trying to learn to do the right things			2
not many people came back from exile compared with those who left			2
about a million left -- 50,000 came back , and of those about 25,000 did a u-turn because it was n't easy			1
it was n't easy but it 's been a great experience			2
@entity2 : how would you define the culture of @entity47 ' burg ? @entity44 : there 's no one culture -- it 's a cosmopolitan city			2
it 's so diverse , like @entity1 itself has so many diverse cultures			1
but again , we are still living in the culture of ethnic grouping			0
if we could beat that and have a major festival of tolerance , it would be the shining path			0
@entity2 : where do you like to go out in @entity47 ' burg ? @entity44 : i go to @entity161 , i go to the @entity162 a lot , and also to the @entity164 , because we have very brilliant dance choreographers			0
old @entity47 ' burg was vibrant , there were things going on all the time -- concerts , festivals , clubs -- but in the last 10 years or so it has become a very quiet city at night			2
@entity2 : what is life like in the city ? @entity44 : it 's not very easy to enjoy the city because the safety and security is not such that you can just go anywhere any time			0
there 's a sadness about this city that everybody talks about			0
people in @entity1 have become inward ; they spend most of the time in their homes			2
when it gets dark , everyone wants to go home as quickly as they can			0
that is not only @entity47 ' burg 's problem , it is a national problem			0
what we 're talking about does n't make me very popular with the people who run this country , but it 's nothing new -- you see it in the newspapers every day			2
it has to be fixed , because the people of @entity1 deserve entertainment , recreation and freedom to enjoy the beauty of their country and to show guests around and say " this is my country			2
