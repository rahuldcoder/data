-- an online petition to save a healthy young giraffe from death has failed , despite thousands of signatures from animal lovers			1
@entity6 said it euthanized the male , named @entity8 , on sunday because of a duty to avoid inbreeding			1
after an autopsy , " @entity8 " was dismembered in front of a zoo audience that included children , and fed to the zoo 's lions			1
despite online uproar over the move and reports of last - minute attempts to save the animal , the zoo in the @entity20 capital said it had no place for @entity8 in its giraffe herd			1
" our giraffes are part of an international breeding program , which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes , " @entity28 , scientific director at @entity6 , told @entity0			1
" it can only be done by matching the genetic composition of the various animals with the available space			2
... when giraffes breed as well as they do now , then you will inevitably run into so - called surplus problems now and then			0
" @entity0 anchor @entity42 asked @entity28 if it would have been possible to sterilize @entity8 or move him to another zoo to avoid killing him			1
" if we just sterilize him , he will take up space for more genetically valuable giraffes , " @entity28 answered			2
did the children watching cry ? @entity42 asked			0
just the opposite , @entity28 said			0
the crowd was " very enthusiastic " and " the kids asked good questions			0
" @entity54 to the lions the carcass was used partly for research and partly to feed carnivores at the zoo -- lions , tigers , and leopards			1
" in this case we would never throw away 200 kilograms of meat , " @entity28 said			0
he said the giraffe was 2 years old , and while he was not officially named , his keepers had called him @entity8 to identify him			2
the giraffe 's impending death had sparked outrage online , with more than 27,000 people signing a " @entity73 " petition , appealing for a last - minute change of heart			1
" the zoo has raised him so it is their responsibility to find him a home , " author @entity75 wrote on the petition site			2
@entity6 said that due to a massive debate on its @entity83 page , it had published a q&a about the decision on its website			1
" it is not possible to transfer the giraffe to another zoo as it will cause inbreeding , " it said			1
several zoos volunteered to take @entity8 in			0
the @entity93 's @entity92 , which says it has a state - of - the - art giraffe house and the capacity for an extra male , was among several places which put in offers to take him			1
international breeding program @entity6 said only zoos that follow certain rules can be part of international breeding programs			1
in @entity107 , these are members of the @entity108			0
the association counts just over 300 members and under its rules , inbreeding among giraffes is to be avoided			2
the association said in a statement sunday that it supports the zoo 's decision			1
despite @entity8 being healthy , his genes are already well represented at the zoo			2
releasing the giraffe into the wild would be unlikely to succeed , @entity6 said			1
contraceptives " have a number of unwanted side effects on the internal organs and we would therefore apply a poorer animal welfare if we did not euthanize , " it said			0
it also made clear that its policy was not to sell the animals			0
outside autopsy @entity28 told @entity0 the autopsy had been performed outside , given the giraffe 's size , and watched by the public , including children if their parents allowed them to			1
" it is a good opportunity to invite our guests to watch			0
... we are here to educate people and that is a good way to show people what a giraffe looks like , " he said			1
" people could come into this area if they wanted to			2
they came with children , without children , we had a lot of people			2
" he said a group of about 16 protesters had gathered outside the zoo on sunday morning and that he had tried to speak with them			2
he said all options had been explored before the decision had been made			0
" we have always been very open about it , explaining why we are doing it , " he said			0
on average , he said some 20 to 30 animals , including goats , antelopes and wild boar , were culled for the same reason every year at the zoo			0
" this is the first giraffe			0
... i do not understand the outrage -- we are all used to on a current basis of animals being culled in the wild , " he said			0
" we have to ensure a safe healthy population for the future , and you can only have a healthy population if you control and coordinate your breeding efforts			0
