-- at best i 'm a 5			2
some of you top out at 4			2
wo n't name names , but i 've seen you walking into @entity4			2
usually when i 'm walking out of @entity5			2
so , we 're in this thing together			2
but , yes , at best i 'm a 5			2
and i 'm totally ok with my status as a 5			0
because , according to a new study , having average appearance is sexy			1
@entity13 has n't called yet about a photo shoot , but i 've laid out my very best cargo shorts just to be safe			0
this is all based on a theory called @entity18 , and it originally spawned from the hit tv show " @entity21 , " when @entity23 ' character , @entity22 , explained the phenomenon to his friends while admiring patrons in a bar			1
@entity22 says , " @entity18 is when a group of women seems hot , but only as a group			1
they seem hot , but take each one of them individually ... sled dogs ! " apparently , it 's all about social averaging within a group , where , somehow , the appearance of those who are ugly improves and the appearance of those who are beautiful declines into some sort of perfect middle ground			1
basically , the entire group becomes an @entity46 's menu , which is excitingly tasty			1
but that 's what we 're talking about here			0
and @entity18 definitely applies to both sexes , as was proven by actual researchers at the @entity54 where this real - life study was conducted for both men and women			1
the results , recently published in the journal @entity60 , reveal that a good way to boost your overall attractiveness when out in public is to simply surround yourself with other people			0
preferably with people you know			0
" @entity68 of a bris , eh ? hi , i 'm @entity71			0
" of course , it all seems rather obvious			0
in social situations , being surrounded by others makes you more desirable than being a mouth - breathing loner surrounded by self - doubt			1
but this study is n't about your vibe			0
it 's about your actual appearance			1
the lead scientists , @entity83 and @entity84 , wrote that people 's faces tend to " average out " in a group , making an individual 's overall look less unique than it otherwise would be			1
which does n't necessarily sound like a good thing			0
according to this research , social averaging really is the key to looking good in public settings			0
@entity83 explains in the study that , " average faces are more attractive , likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies			1
perhaps it 's like @entity103 's families : beautiful people are all alike , but every unattractive person is unattractive in their own way			0
" basically , they surmise that while hanging out in a group does n't necessarily accentuate your supposed good qualities , it does , however , minimize your less attractive features			1
so that weird @entity113 - shaped birthmark on your cheek ... pfft , like it 's not even there ! in fact , the findings showed that people in groups were rated 5.5 % more attractive than when viewed on their own			1
which does n't sound like much			0
to actually test this @entity18 theory , five experiments were done with over 130 undergraduate students who were shown pictures of 100 people			1
they were then asked to rate their attractiveness			0
some of the people in the pictures were cropped alone , and in other photos they were a part of a group			1
ultimately , both women and men were found to be more attractive in the group shots			1
of course , once you couple off away from the group , you 're on your own and the truth comes out			2
" is that ... @entity113 ? " so , there 's definitely some merit to the idea of a wingman , or a wingwoman			0
and the more of them you have , the better			0
let 's go bris crashing ! follow @ @entity150 on @entity151 .			0

going out in groups makes you more attractive than going out alone
the @entity18 was *coined* in the hit tv show " @entity21 "
faces in a group tend to average together which , in turn , averages out appearance *flaws*
