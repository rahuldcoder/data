@entity0 -- the @entity3 military continues to increase spending on efforts to break into @entity7 military computer systems , expand its @entity8 , and invest in intercontinental nuclear missiles and weapons to destroy satellites , according to the latest @entity7 report on @entity3 's military power			1
@entity3 military officers after a meeting about the @entity17 in 2007			1
the annual report from the @entity19 to @entity20 says @entity3 's total military spending in 2007 was between $ 97 billion and $ 139 billion , but it is hard to tell exactly how much was spent and on what			1
in comparison , the @entity7 military budget request for 2008 is $ 481.4 billion , not including war requests			2
@entity19 officials said a chunk of @entity3 's spending went to cyberwarfare , because 2007 saw several " intrusions " believed to be from the @entity17			1
in the incidents , unclassified @entity7 military computer systems were broken into and information was taken , according to @entity19 officials			1
while the information taken was not classified , @entity19 officials said the worry is the @entity3 hacking required many of the skills and capabilities that would also be required for a computer network attack			1
last summer , a cyber-attack on @entity19 computer systems took down the e-mail capability of hundreds of staffers for weeks , but the @entity19 still will not comment on who initiated the attack			0
it is widely believed among the military to have been the @entity17			0
@entity3 is also investing heavily in and fielding improved nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and antisatellite missiles , according to the report			0
the @entity7 expressed its concern last year after @entity3 fired a missile at one of its old satellites and destroyed it , sending thousands of dangerous pieces of space debris into orbit			2
the @entity7 conducted a similar strike last month on a broken @entity7 spy satellite before it re-entered the @entity63 's atmosphere			0
@entity7 officials said the satellite was hit and broke into thousands of small pieces that burned up as they re-entered @entity63 's atmosphere			2
the @entity7 is also concerned about the purchase of more submarines by the @entity3 navy as well as plans for more aircraft carriers			0
the @entity3 once had a small @entity8			0
now the @entity7 is keeping an eye on the growing service amid concerns over @entity77			0
the concerns include " @entity3 's near - term focus on preparing for contingencies in the @entity81 , including the possibility of @entity7 intervention , which is an important driver of its modernization , " the report says			1
additionally , the @entity3 have placed about 100 more short - range missiles on the shore opposite @entity77 in the past year , it says			0
@entity19 officials worry the continued increase in @entity3 military spending is slowly tipping the balance of power between @entity3 and @entity77 in @entity3 's favor			1
the @entity7 has said it would help defend @entity77 if @entity3 invaded			0
the report also says the @entity17 is " pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short - duration , high - intensity conflicts along its periphery against high - tech adversaries			0
" such an army , the report says , would have " the greatest potential to compete militarily with the @entity7 and field disruptive military technologies that could , over time , offset traditional @entity7 military advantages			2
" the @entity7 says the lack of transparency by the @entity3 on its spending poses " risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation , " and that @entity3 has yet to explain to the international community the purpose of its military expansion , @entity19 officials said			1
