@entity0 -- when @entity3 and @entity4 hit the pitch for the 2014 @entity7 opener on thursday , football fanatics in @entity0 will be forced to contend with more than an unfriendly time zone if they want to catch the action			1
the nationwide midnight to 4 a.m curfew , imposed by the military three weeks ago when it took over the country in a coup after months of political and social unrest , has been lifted in more than 30 provinces and districts , including @entity18 's tourist hotspots such as @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
this poses a problem for the city 's notoriously diehard football fans who want to watch the games with friends and fellow revelers -- many of the matches start between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. local time			1
" i 'm a bit worried about staying out late to watch the games , but it should be fine , as police and military are n't that strict about the curfew , " says @entity33 , a 33 - year - old @entity0 graphic designer and a self - described huge football fan			1
@entity33 says he doubts bars will be airing all the matches due to the curfew so he 'll likely watch at a friend 's house			2
" solders have stopped me after midnight on the road to ask where i 'm going , and when i tell them i 'm going home it 's fine , they let me carry on , " he says			0
speaking to reporters last week , members of the ruling junta said they will not be lifting the curfew in the capital just so people can watch football , advising fans to go home early and cheer on their favorite teams with their families instead			0
@entity0 bars work around curfew during the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity0 was filled with viewing parties , many offering fans giant led screens and outdoor beer gardens			2
waves of supporters dressed in the colors of their teams			0
( @entity18 has never qualified for a @entity7			2
) but the time zone was friendlier then , with evening games the norm			0
and there was no curfew			0
this time around , many sports pubs are trying to find ways around the midnight - 4 a.m. curfew			1
some say they 're planning to push their luck			0
@entity83 , owner of @entity84 , a downtown @entity85 pub frequented by @entity0 expats , says curfew enforcement varies widely from day to day , so he 's unsure how things will go during the month - long football event			1
" i have every intention of showing as many games as possible , depending on public demand , " says @entity83			0
" unfortunately , with the curfew still in place it 's hard to know what to expect , especially from the police			0
they came to my bar at 1 a.m. this morning to close it down , so i hope this will not set a precedent for the @entity7			1
" i can only hope that given the importance of the matches coupled with @entity18 's love of the beautiful game , they will let us watch the tournament in peace			2
" other @entity0 pubs have said they 'll allow patrons in only as late as midnight , then will let visitors watch behind locked doors			1
" we will be open but due to the current curfew space will be limited to upstairs , " advertises the @entity115 on its website			0
" customers will need to be in before 12 and can leave at their discretion ( although we would not advise it )			0
" some are keeping their fingers crossed that the junta will lift the curfew			0
" at present we can only show 11 p.m. games and games starting at 5 a.m , but we are hoping the curfew will be lifted thursday , " says a representative from @entity0 's @entity127 , another popular haunt among expats and visiting tourists			1
@entity134 , who owns a restaurant and bar called " @entity138 " on @entity0 's @entity137 , says the curfew has harmed his business , though he understands why the military is concerned about keeping the city safe			2
" i 'm not worried about the curfew for the games at 11 p.m. , i 'll still air them and hope we do n't get shut down before the end , " he says			1
" but i wo n't be able to stay open for the later matches			1
i 'll probably have to go to a friend 's house to watch them			0
" the army has been nice every time i 'm stopped on the road after curfew , as i explain that i 'm heading home from work			2
" @entity157 goes quiet @entity1 visited @entity157 this week to find out how bar owners and guest houses plan to deal with the curfew situation during the @entity7			1
a popular stop for backpackers thanks to the high concentration of guest houses , tour agencies , bars and restaurants in the old part of the city , the strip is usually a favorite @entity7 viewing spot for the local and international football crowd			2
but this year , the consensus seems to be that while many bars will try to get away with airing the 11 p.m. games , that 's as hard as they 'll push it			1
multiple bar staff told @entity1 that police were strictly enforcing the curfew and making bars close promptly at midnight -- though plenty of tourists continue to roam the strip after closing time			1
some bars said they had n't even bought the license to air the games , but will do so if the junta lifts the curfew soon			2
a staff member at @entity190 , who did n't want to be named , said the establishment will likely let people watch in the common area but will have to keep the noise down in consideration of guests			0
@entity3 2014 : will @entity7 redeem people 's faith in football ? @entity201 tries to ' return happiness ' with free @entity7 broadcasts on the sidelines of @entity18 's political drama , confusion over just how many of the @entity7 games locals will be able to watch at home played out in the courts this week			2
@entity18 's @entity210 ( @entity210 ) tried to force @entity211 , the exclusive rights holder for the @entity7 , to allow @entity18 's free tv channels to broadcast all of the @entity7 matches			1
earlier , @entity211 won the case in @entity18 's @entity215 and announced it would televise only 22 @entity7 matches on free tv			1
the rest could be viewed only through purchased tv boxes			0
the @entity210 appealed the court 's ruling but were shut down on wednesday			0
on wednesday evening , the @entity210 hinted that they would subsidize the matches in line with the junta 's campaign to " return happiness to the @entity18 people " so that everyone could watch all the games on free cable at home			0
no word on whether those who bothered to buy the boxes will be eligible for a refund .			0
