@entity3 had hoped to lead @entity1 to victory on home soil but his failure to win over his critics with his muscular type of play appears to have cost him			1
the 50 - year - old , who replaced the legendary @entity17 following the @entity18 , had come under heavy scrutiny following his side 's failure to win a historic first @entity23 gold at @entity24 -- losing in the final to @entity26 despite fielding a star - studded line - up			1
the news was greeted with joy by former @entity1 striker and @entity2 winner @entity31 ,			1

although his team won six of its eight matches since the @entity23 , with 26 goals coming in the process , @entity3 struggled to justify his switch away from the freeflowing , samba - style football associated with @entity1			1
but the decision came as a surprise with @entity1 slowly beginning to look more impressive with several key players returning to form			2
the attacking trio of @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 provided a real threat , while @entity84 and @entity85 had recently shone in the center of midfield			0
