@entity0 -- it was the most vivid , and unexpected , confrontation of wednesday 's @entity4 address			0
it happened when president @entity6 said this : " last week , the @entity8 reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections			1
" in the audience , justice @entity16 , president @entity17 's second appointee to the @entity8 , could be seen shaking his head and saying , it appeared , " not true , not true			1
" who 's right ? as for what the court decided in @entity24 v. @entity25 , @entity6 seems to be right -- mostly			1
in a 5 - 4 decision , written by justice @entity28 and joined by @entity16 , the court held that corporations , labor unions and other organizations had the right under the @entity33 to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence the outcomes of elections			1
if a corporation now wants to saturate the airwaves for or against any candidate for office , including on the eve of the election , it now has the @entity8 's say - so to do it			0
@entity6 was on shakier ground when he said foreign companies now had the same unlimited rights to participate in our elections			2
the court 's opinion very carefully said it was not deciding the issue with regard to foreign entities			0
so the court may yet give the green light to these foreign companies -- but it has n't done so yet			0
on the larger question of whether @entity16 should have expressed himself in this restrained but unmistakable way , i 'm with the justice			2
attending the @entity4 has always been an awkward duty for the justices -- sitting through these political addresses and wondering when it 's appropriate to applaud or react			2
gloves come off after @entity6 rips ruling when the president is paying tribute to the armed forces , or making an otherwise uncontroversial point , the justices usually join in the clapping ; when the point is more political -- like the one @entity6 made about @entity24 on wednesday -- the tradition is for the justices not to react			1
but it 's wise to remember that the justices are human beings , with strong views on many subjects , including their own decisions			1
when @entity6 was criticizing the court 's work ( as was his right ) , @entity16 had the right to react the way anyone would who had taken a shot in a high - profile setting			1
in my book , even a @entity8 justice -- even at the @entity4 -- is entitled to grimace and mutter			0
( it is worth noting that @entity16 does seem to have an ax to grind with @entity6			1
as a senator , @entity6 voted against @entity16 's confirmation , which the justice does not seem to have forgotten			1
when the president - elect @entity6 made a courtesy call on the justices shortly before his inauguration last year , @entity16 was the only member of the court not to attend			1
) still , it 's worth remembering who is likely to have the last word in this confrontation			0
in his speech , @entity6 went on to say about the court 's opinion , " well , i do n't think @entity113 elections should be bankrolled by @entity113 's most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities			2
they should be decided by the @entity113 people , and that 's why i 'm urging @entity119 and @entity120 to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong			0
" the president and the @entity123 can try -- but it is the court that will have the last word on evaluating whether any new law is constitutional			0
and @entity16 , who is 59 years old with life tenure , will likely be passing on the validity of laws long after @entity6 has left office			2
as justice @entity131 said of the court many years ago , " we are not final because we are infallible , but we are infallible only because we are final			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			0

@entity135 says a comment by president @entity6 led to an awkward moment
he says justice @entity16 seemed to *disagree* on @entity6 's take on campaign finance ruling
@entity135 says @entity6 was mostly right on the result of *recent* court decision
he says @entity16 also was right to express his view ; justices are human beings
