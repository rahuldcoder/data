@entity0 -- a prominent gay rights advocacy group says a key congressional @entity3 will push for new rights for same - sex couples in the @entity7 's immigration reform bill -- a move which could undermine the legislation 's bipartisan support			1
according to a spokesman for @entity12 , @entity15 @entity14 sen. @entity13 intends to offer an amendment later this month allowing foreign - born individuals in committed same - sex relationships with @entity19 to apply for green cards			1
currently , such rights apply to only to foreign - born men or women in heterosexual marriages with @entity19 citizens			2
" that 's our expectation , " said @entity26 , a spokesman for the group , which promotes equality in immigration laws for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender individuals			1
" after the meetings we 've had with @entity13 and his staff , the message is pretty clear			2
" a spokeswoman for @entity13 refused to confirm @entity40 ' assertion			2
the senator is an outspoken proponent of expanded rights for same - sex couples , and proposed similar legislation in the past			1
under the plan , according to @entity40 , gays and lesbians requesting green cards for foreign - born partners would have to be married if their states currently recognize same - sex marriages			1
if their states do not recognize same - sex marriage , they would have to meet a series of requirements proving major emotional and financial commitments			1
the list of requirements could include jointly owned property , shared child custody , joint bank accounts , joint credit cards , proof of a commitment ceremony and photographs of shared vacations and holidays with extended family , among other things			2
@entity13 , head of the @entity70 , will likely propose the change at some point after his panel starts considering amendments on may 9 , @entity26 said			1
if @entity13 moves forward with the amendment , it could destroy hopes for any significant @entity79 backing of the sweeping legislation			1
@entity82 sen. @entity81 , one of @entity79 architects of the 844 - page bill , said tuesday that adding such a provision would not be politically feasible in the ideologically polarized @entity86			2
the bill " was not intended to cover everybody in every situation , " @entity81 told conservative radio talk show host @entity87			0
" this immigration bill is difficult enough as it is			0
... if you inject something like this in the bill , it will die			0
the coalition behind it will fall apart			0
" @entity81 , a potential presidential candidate and one of four republicans in the @entity7 's so - called " @entity101 " that authored the bill , stressed that he would withdraw his own support			1
" i hope we can avoid this , " he said			0
" this is not the issue to engage this in , or you will threaten the entire product			0
" it is significantly easier for @entity13 to add the amendment to the bill while it is being considered by his panel			1
@entity14 hold a 10 - 8 majority on the @entity70 , and can approve changes on a strict majority basis			0
controversial amendments taken up by the full @entity7 will almost certainly be required to garner a 60 - vote supermajority			0
members of the @entity14 caucus only control 55 seats in the 100 - member chamber			0
backers of the bill have been hoping to win as many as 70 votes in the @entity7 , in order to give the bill major momentum heading into the more skeptical , @entity79 - controlled @entity130 .			0
