-- the rapid expansion of social media means people can share pretty much everything online shortly after it happens , even video of a real dismemberment			1
this is the strange and frightening digital world we have descended into after a horrific video clip of a dismemberment found its way on to the @entity12 last week and was rapidly shared via social media , attracting more than 300,000 hits in four hours			1
such offensive material is normally hidden in the deep web , a dark place no search engine can access , where users trade everything from conspiracy theories to bootlegged software			0
other shock videos of disgusting acts and workplace fatalities are often shared there , too			0
but what this video has done is expose this underbelly of the @entity12 and pushed it into wide circulation , finding an audience among the morbidly curious who have spread mass interest in graphic torture franchises like the movies " @entity37 " and " @entity38			1
" our fascination with the macabre has always been there , but are we becoming desensitized to such violence when it transforms from fiction into the real thing ? with every click of this video , it 's as if we 've gone from wanting to be a fly on the wall of a crime scene to being a fly on the corpse			1
responsible journalists , who aim to find balance and sensitivity when reporting on serious crimes by adding context , holding back or blurring the most offensive parts , have been pushed aside by this crowd of gross - out seekers			1
the 10 - minute online video shows the stabbing and dismemberment of a @entity66 student who had been studying in @entity67			1
the video has been copied and shared so many times that authorities will never be able to delete what is essentially the key evidence in a criminal prosecution			2
one website that copied the original footage has attracted more than 445,000 views and crashed			0
" if i was n't completely ruined by the internet i would be more shocked , but i 've seen some stuff kinda like that , " said one young person in response to watching the snuff video			2
" if you 've seen the ' saw ' movies you should be fine			0
you could probably stomach that better than most people			2
" the problem is that those who are watching do n't realize how they have moved from being passive viewers in a true crime story to becoming participants			2
the video was obviously put out there to be seen by the widest possible audience , and the video 's maker must be thrilled to know his handiwork has been promoted globally and seen by more than a million people			1
but almost nothing can be done to fix this			0
even if laws were changed or strengthened to charge webmasters for hosting obscene material , it could never be properly policed			0
and as the music industry learned , the only way to significantly reduce piracy is to provide the content itself at a cost			0
clearly law enforcement agencies are n't about to start accepting cash from the public to download graphic videos they have obtained during their investigations			0
in essence , it 's too late to go back and we 're stuck with this awful content being a part of our culture			0
the man police suspect made the video , @entity67 resident @entity124 , 29 , was captured in @entity128 on monday after an extensive international manhunt			2
he is believed to have fled to @entity130 on may 26 , and then headed for @entity128			0
during the manhunt , @entity124 is believed to have even been commenting online on the police case against him , and reading articles about himself moments before the dragnet closed in			2
all the while his social media presence increased -- tripling his @entity136 profile following and boosting the number of " fans " on @entity139			1
it 's clear in this case how social media has been changing all aspects of crime : how it is conducted , how it is reported and how the public becomes involved			1
the often disturbing places where only killers , hardened detectives and well - prepared jurors had been given unfiltered access are now becoming available to everyone , anyone , instantly			0
all you need is @entity153 and the desire to seek it out			0
we are all interconnected , from killers to children , grandmothers to corporate executives			0
this case is even a big progression from the first generation of social media killers who only a few years ago were more teasing about their exploits than being this overt			1
in 2008 , filmmaker @entity165 amassed a large online following when @entity168 , @entity169 , police discovered his murder movie script had been re-enacted in real - life			1
the young father had been obsessed with " @entity173 , " his favorite television series , and modeled his goal of becoming a serial killer on the fictional character			0
@entity165 used social media in the planning , execution and covering up of his brutal crimes			1
friends of his victim received many @entity139 messages from him saying he was on a @entity186 holiday with a new girlfriend , explaining away his sudden disappearance			0
it was n't until later when police realized who was actually behind those suspicious messages			0
the cover of the internet only worked for so long			0
some who have viewed the recent video in this new disturbing twist in social media crime may regret it			1
you ca n't unsee a video of a dismemberment , and i fear they could end up like some homicide detectives , haunted in retirement by what they have seen			1
but maybe that is the hope and comfort in this terrible story -- that many people are not so desensitized by violence that they laugh or shrug a shoulder upon watching a real man 's horrific end put online			1
maybe they can be a new wave online that warns others not to buy into it -- to deprive the killer of his audience might send this kind of material back into the sick underbelly from where it came			1
one teenage girl who saw it posted a video of herself shaking and in tears , begging people not to watch it			1
another man , who watched the video , also clearly regrets it			2
he recorded his reaction on @entity237 and is nearly cowering in fear by the end of it , at times even screaming in near hysteria , panting and covering his face with his hands			0
" this is the most gruesome , disgusting video i 've ever watched , " he wrote under the posting as a warning to others			2
" please do n't watch the video			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			1
