@entity0 -- if you want to make a phone call you will have to find a big red box on the street -- that 's if you 're prepared to brave the occasional dense smogs that afflict @entity0			1
or you could instead curl up on the sofa with a hot drink and watch the only channel on television ; as long as you have n't already used your tea ration for the week and your family is one of the few that has a tv set			1
anyone taking a ride in a time machine back to the @entity0 of 1952 when @entity19 came to the throne would find a dramatically different country to the @entity23 's modern capital			1
the country was still suffering from the aftermath of @entity25 and there was very little to resemble what we might now recognize as youth culture there were no mobile phones of course , but 60 years ago few people in the @entity23 owned a car , television or washing machine			1
some food rationing was still in place -- tea rationing ended in october of that year but sweets and sugar were still rationed until 1953			1
even clean air was not guaranteed			2
in december 1952 , 4,000 people were killed by the choking urban fumes that accompanied the @entity45 , and thousands more were made ill. @entity46 was @entity23 prime minister , identity cards were only just being ripped up and the blockbuster " singin ' in the rain " starring @entity49 was playing at the movies			1
@entity23 people bought and sold in farthings , florins , tanners , shillings , half crowns and thrupenny bits , and sometimes using coins minted in the reign of the queen 's great , great - grandmother , queen @entity62			1
finding the 1952 smash hit so what was life really like in 1952 and how does it compare to modern @entity23 ? " i hated it , " recalls @entity67 who set up the @entity69 1950s - era museum in @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity23			1
sex was forbidden and smoking was chic			2
" you had to do exactly the same as your parents			0
you wore the same clothes as your @entity81 was n't really a youth culture -- music was n't orientated towards youth , " he said			0
so if you journeyed back to 1952 and turned on a bakelite radio , what would be the summer 's smash hit ? it 's difficult to say			1
@entity90 had n't happened yet and neither had an officially compiled @entity23 pop chart -- success was previously measured in sales of sheet music			0
the first list based on record sales in the @entity23 was published by @entity98 in november 1952 and the first chart topper was @entity102 's " here in my heart			1
" listen to @entity102 's hit and then compare it to the current @entity23 top - selling single by @entity105			1
called " we are young , " and featuring @entity107			0
the early 1950s belonged to traditional singers like @entity110 and @entity111 though the male youth culture centered on the " @entity113 " was starting to make an appearance			0
with their distinctive swept - back hair , smart jackets and crepe - soled shoes , the fashion grew out of a revival of the clothing of the reign of the queen 's great - grandfather @entity123 -- these " @entity125 " became the teds			1
fashion was also changing for women			0
@entity129 , curator at @entity0 's @entity130 , said : " @entity127 changed tremendously in the years immediately following the war			1
the real emphasis became femininity and luxury after years of ' make do and mend			2
' designers such as @entity136 revolutionized surface pattern with strong sophisticated color and style			0
firms like @entity141 also created brightly colored , fashionable cotton dresses			0
" it 's the new color that @entity144 , 76 , recalls from his youth in @entity146 , north @entity0			1
" ladies wore flowery frocks , " he said			0
" they went colourful after the drab clothes during the war and wore long gloves on special occasions			0
men always wore a hat or cap when out			0
" he said he liked being freed from rationing and the independence of getting his first scooter			2
tell us how are you marking the jubilee salary levels clearly depended on your job but most people earned less than £ 10 ( $ 15.40 ) a week ... roughly equivalent to £ 260 ( $ 400 ) now			2
the @entity23 's minimum wage is currently set at about £ 240 ( $ 369 ) a week for 40 hours ' work			2
new coinage introduced in early 1970s even most @entity23 time travelers would find 1950s @entity0 bewildering			1
there were 12 pennies in a shilling , 20 shillings in pound , and each penny had a quarter value			0
some of the coins had nick names so a shopkeeper might tell you a purchase was " two and a tanner " or a " bob , three farthings			0
" the currency changed in the early 1970s so time - travelers younger than their mid- 40s might find themselves confused ... or conned			0
the cost of some things are roughly equal			0
in 1952 , a loaf cost about three pence ( about 50p or 77 cents ) in modern terms ... but for a limited choice			2
now we can buy a huge range of different styles -- from ciabattas to chilli flatbread			0
one big food chain store in the @entity23 lists more than 100 bread options on its website , ranging from 45p ( 60 cents ) to £ 1.87 ( $ 2.88 ) , and all can be bought online			2
the term " buy with a click of a mouse " would be complete nonsense to someone living in the mid- 50s as home computers had yet to be invented and the web was decades away			0
a study of spending over the last half century reveals some surprising trends			0
a mid- 1950s family spent 33 % of their budget on food , compared to around 15 % in the modern era			1
and according to the same figures from the @entity23 's @entity224 , the biggest expense on the shopping list after rent or mortgage payments was for cigarettes			1
six per cent of the family budget went up in a haze of blue smoke			1
" everyone smoked -- that 's a really big difference to nowadays , " said @entity67			2
" to chat up girls you would always offer them a cigarette			0
" @entity0 smokers now have to puff away in the street because smoking inside public buildings is banned			1
and they might not recognize the local landscape either			0
" in 1952 , @entity23 had n't really turned the corner from @entity25 , " said @entity240 , curator of social and working history at the @entity242			2
" you would still see significant evidence of bomb damage and the legacy of the war -- a lot of recovery was still going on			0
" some things may never change so has anything stayed the same -- would our time travelers recognize anything from 1952 ? @entity256 's play @entity255 opened in @entity0 in 1952 and is still showing at @entity257			1
mr. @entity258 was launched in the @entity259 by @entity260 and is sharing a diamond anniversary with the queen , though both the popular toy and the monarchy now have a @entity266 page			0
the @entity23 are still passionate about football and cricket , and they still drink in pubs			0
@entity0 's great landmarks like @entity271 , the @entity272 and the @entity273 still stand but are somewhat cleaner since the dark days of the smog			1
distinctive , red double - deck buses and black cabs still cruise the streets , and the weather is much the same			0
adventurous older time travelers returning to their youth might also take some comfort from the queen 's words			2
in @entity19 's first @entity285 speech in 1952 she said : " we must keep alive that courageous spirit of adventure that is the finest quality of youth ; and by youth i do not just mean those who are young in years ; i mean too all those who are young in heart , no matter how old they may be			1
" you can see more of the @entity0 of 1952 by visiting a collection of pictures at historypin			1

tea rationing ended in october 1952 but sweets and sugar were still rationed until 1953
in 1952 4,000 people were killed by the @entity0 smog and thousands more made sick
when @entity19 came to the throne , 6 % of the family budget was spent on cigarettes
