@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration has filed a request with the 9th @entity5 to stay a lower court injunction stopping the military policy regarding openly gay troops serving			1
late tuesday , @entity10 district court judge @entity9 in @entity11 denied the government 's request for an emergency stay of her order barring the military from expelling openly gay service members			1

groups representing gays and lesbians have warned against coming out to the military because the policy is still being appealed in courts			1

" during this interim period of uncertainty , service members must not come out and recruits should use caution if choosing to sign up , " @entity52 executive director @entity55 said in the statement			2
" the bottom line : if you come out now , it can be used against you in the future by the @entity19			1
