@entity0 , @entity1 -- this weekend , @entity1 will begin digging into its tragic past as anthropologists start unearthing what they believe are the remains of dozens of children buried on the grounds of a former reform school			1
the exhumations at the @entity11 for boys -- which closed in 2011 -- are the culmination of years of controversy surrounding the reform school and a mythology that has taken on a life of its own			1
rightly or wrongly , the @entity20 town of @entity0 -- just west of @entity21 -- has become synonymous with the school and its dark past			1
some of those who were once sent to @entity25 -- now senior citizens -- have come forward with stories of abuse at the school , including alleged beatings , torture , sexual abuse , killings and the disappearance of students , during the 1940s , ' 50s and ' 60s			1
on the school grounds buried deep in the woods lies a small unkept patch of land with 31 white crosses			1
rusting away with time , they mark the final resting place for the unknown students that the state has confirmed were buried there			1
nearly 100 children died while at the school , according to state and school records , many as a result of a tragic dormitory fire in 1914 and a deadly flu epidemic in 1918			1
the poorly kept state records can not account for what happened to 22 children who died at the school			1
and no one knows who is buried where			1
" they were poor kids and a lot of times , people never came to visit them , " said @entity58 , a lifelong @entity0 resident and head of the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity1 , which includes @entity0			1
" even when they were dismissed , they got home , their family had moved			2
so , who was going to pay attention if something happened to them while they was at @entity25 ? " some believe the bodies are african - americans , disposed of by the @entity76			2
this gravesite is in what was traditionally known as the " black side " of the reform school -- a reference to the era of segregation			1
many believe another cemetery exists on the sprawling , wooded , 1,400 - acre property , but it has not been found			1
last year , a research team from the @entity89 , on a humanitarian mission to help identify these bodies for surviving families , used ground - penetrating radar , and found that there are as many as 19 more bodies buried in the surrounding area -- completely unmarked			1
after clearing the area , the team determined that 49 graves exist			1
" these are children who came here and died , for one reason or another , and have just been lost in the woods , " said @entity99 , a forensic anthropologist leading the @entity89 team , who once worked on an international forensics team that amassed evidence used in @entity104 war crimes trials			1
she has lobbied for an exhumation of the remains because , as she put it , " when there 's no knowledge and no information , then people will speculate and rumors will persist or questions remain			2
" ' @entity11 ' @entity119 spent about 10 months at the @entity11 between 1963 and 1964 for allegedly stealing a car			2
he says he was taken to the " @entity11 " on his very first day			0
" i came out of there in shock , and when they hit you , you went down a foot into the bed , and so hard , i could n't believe , " said @entity119			0
" i did n't know what they were hitting you with			0
" years ago , @entity119 and several others who spent time at @entity25 came forward with allegations that they were beaten with long leather straps inside a small white concrete building they forever call " the @entity11			0
" the men became known as the " @entity11			0
" one former administrator , @entity135 -- a one - armed man accused of abuse by several former students -- admitted that " spankings " took place , but denied that anyone was ever beaten or murdered			0
@entity1 first started looking into the allegations in 2008 , after some of the @entity11 -- who had met on the @entity143 and shared similar stories -- called on then - gov. @entity145 to investigate			1
at @entity145 's request , the @entity146 launched an investigation and its final report in 2009 accounted for 31 boys buried in the cemetery			1
the investigation failed to clear up the mystery over what happened to the dozens of other students who died at the school whose bodies have never been accounted for			2
@entity146 closed the case due to lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct			0
the @entity162 closed the school in 2011 , 111 years after it first opened			2
then last year , forensic anthropologists from @entity89 used their ground - penetrating radar to find what appeared to be 19 more remains than previously thought to have been buried on the school grounds			1
that discovery , along with pressure from the @entity60 and high - level officials , including sen. @entity171 , @entity1 , led to action by the state			1
earlier this month , @entity1 gov. @entity174 and his cabinet voted to allow the @entity89 forensics team to exhume the bodies , against the objections of @entity61 commissioners			1
" there were children that disappeared that really were not accounted for , so i think that a new day has come here , " said @entity180 , secretary of the @entity162			2
" what we have now is an opportunity to really get down to the truth and also try to bring some healing to the victims and the families			0
" @entity192 's story state records say one boy buried here is 14 - year - old @entity196			2
" he had no ambition to do anything but play music , " said his sister @entity197 , 84			0
she says her older brother ran away from home in 1940 at age 14 to become a musician in @entity206 , but never made it			0
@entity196 was arrested in a stolen car , and sent to the reform school in @entity0			1
he ran away from the school , but got caught , he wrote in a letter to 12 - year - old @entity197 a short time afterward			2
a few months later , his family received a letter from the school , notifying them that @entity192 had run away for a second time			2
" so far , we have been unable to get any information concerning his whereabouts , " wrote @entity216 , the school 's superintendent at the time			2
" we will appreciate your notifying us immediately if you receive any word from or concerning him			0
" @entity192 's family decided to travel to @entity0 to find out what was going on , but just before leaving , there was a call from the school with word that @entity192 had been found dead			1
" they think he crawled under a house to try and get warm and that he got pneumonia and died , " said @entity197			0
she said her mother asked that @entity192 's body be taken to a funeral home			0
the family had to borrow a car for the trip and when they arrived in @entity0 two days later , school officials allegedly told them that their son was already buried			1
" they said that the body was so decomposed , you would n't be able to identify him			0
... they took him straight out to the school and buried him , " she said			1
@entity192 's classmate told the family a different story			0
according to @entity197 , the boy said as he and @entity192 tried to escape , " my brother was running out across a field , an open field , and there was three men shooting at him , with rifles			0
" " i believe to this day that they shot my brother that night , and i think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him , " she said			1
closure , but criminal charges unlikely @entity197 , like other relatives of those believed to be buried at the school , is hoping the exhumations result in a sense of closure for her family			1
any remains that are exhumed will be taken to the @entity89 in @entity272 to be examined in an effort to reunite these lost boys with their families -- if possible			0
earlier this summer , @entity277 swabs were taken from a handful of surviving family members that have been found			2
if @entity277 can be matched to the bodies exhumed , these families want them to be buried properly in family plots			2
" i would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in their cemetery , " @entity197 said			0
" i hope i get that chance			0
" whatever may be found in the exhumations of these long - forgotten children , it 's highly unlikely that anyone could ever be charged with any crimes			1
" you have to have witnesses , " said @entity295 , the state attorney of @entity61			0
" nobody can place a name with a homicide victim and a perpetrator			0
" and that 's nearly impossible considering the amount of time that has passed			0
" there are these general stories about the beatings and all that went on , but that 's not unusual for reformatories in the ' 30s and ' 40s , " he told @entity2			0
but this does n't matter to @entity58 , the @entity60 leader			0
he 's lived here all his life			0
he thinks the truth behind the mystery of @entity0 will finally be found			2
" i do n't think the bones will lie			0
the bones will tell the truth , " he said			0
" i 'd want the truth to be known how i died			0

forensic researchers will begin exhumations this weekend
they believe a total of 49 children were buried at the reform school
in 2009 , @entity1 investigators said 31 children were buried there
the probe found none of the deaths was *suspicious*
