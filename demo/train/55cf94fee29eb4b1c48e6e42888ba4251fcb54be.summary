@entity0 , @entity1 -- neither the on - the - field fame nor the off - the - field notoriety of former @entity7 quarterback @entity6 was enough to spark a bidding war for his suburban @entity10 mansion tuesday			1
no one submitted the minimum $ 3.2 million bid for former @entity15 @entity6 's @entity10 - area mansion			1
the multimillion - dollar home in @entity0 was on the auction block tuesday , but just three real estate agents showed up -- and one of them , @entity19 of @entity20 , was a listing agent who had no clients interested in the property			1
no one offered a bid , so the auction ended before it began			2
the auction required a minimum bid of $ 3.2 million , with a deposit of $ 160,000			1
@entity6 , 28 , is serving a 23 - month sentence after pleading guilty in august 2007 to a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in @entity35			1
he is expected to be released early , possibly in may , and to serve the final two months or so of his sentence under home confinement , most likely in @entity35			0
no dogfights occurred in @entity0 , 40 miles northeast of @entity10			1
the home , in the upscale @entity40 community , has been on the market for more than a year			2
it has eight bedrooms , 11 bathrooms , a four - car garage and a movie theater , among other deluxe features			1
@entity49 of @entity51 / @entity50 said his client offered $ 3.2 million for the home two months ago , but the auction organizers said they wanted to see whether someone would offer more			1
@entity49 said his client withdrew the bid but remains interested			2
" why would i let them use my offer as a benchmark ? " @entity49 asked			0
" i wanted to see who was going to bid and what were they going to offer			2
" he will advise his client to offer less money now , @entity49 said			0
@entity63 of @entity64 also was on hand			0
she said that she has interested buyers but that they did n't want to bid if there was no competition			2
the next step is to be determined by the bankruptcy judge in @entity35 who ordered the sale			0
@entity49 said the price is too high for today 's economy			0
" it is the economy that is dictating the price of the houses , and i 'm sure most of the people still think $ 3.2 million ... is higher than what the market can fetch , " he said			1
@entity63 said no one seems turned off by @entity6 's reputation			1
" nobody cares about who owns it			0
it 's just the product and the location , " she said			0
