-- @entity1 and her mother were hunting for deals at post-christmas sales in 2009 when @entity1 ' left leg involuntarily turned inward and an excruciating pain shot through it			0
at first , she thought the pain was the result of a 2005 operation to fix a herniated disc in her lower back			0
as a massage therapist , yoga instructor , aspiring artist and mother , she could not afford to lose mobility			0
but within a couple of days , @entity1 was practically bedridden			0
she began taking a number of medicines and steroids that changed her personality , caused friends to abandon her and destroyed her marriage			0
but nothing stopped the pain or involuntary movement in her leg			1
" i lost everything , " she says			0
finally , eight months and about 30 doctors ' opinions later , she was diagnosed with dystonia , a little - known but the third most common movement disorder			1
" if you have something invisible going on , then it 's all subjective , " the 41 - year - old says			1
" @entity38 does n't show up on mris and it does n't show up on tests			1
" @entity1 has n't been able to work , slowly watching dystonia spread from her legs to her arms to her neck			1
forced to get around on crutches or in a power chair , the former dancer is mostly confined to her @entity47 , @entity48 , home			0
" you do n't die from dystonia , " she says			1
" but you want to			0
it 's sort of like a life sentence , as opposed to a death sentence			1
" dystonia is often cloaked in mystery and can take years to diagnose			1
in most cases , dystonia 's cause is unknown , and there is no cure			1
patients and medical professionals agree dystonia awareness lags far behind other movement disorders such as parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis			1
dystonia is " characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal , often repetitive , movements , postures , or both , " according to the article " @entity75 and classification of dystonia : a consensus update , " published this year by an international panel of dystonia researchers			1
dystonia can be divided into primary and secondary types , says dr. @entity84 , director of the @entity85 and professor in the department of neurology , pediatrics and human genetics at @entity91			1
it is difficult to quantify exactly how many people suffer from it			1
under the @entity96 guidelines , @entity84 says pure or primary dystonia is identified as a rare disorder , but mixed or secondary dystonia occurs frequently			1
combining the two classifications makes dystonia a common disorder , he says , " because we would have to include cerebral palsy , parkinson 's disease and a whole load of others			1
" there are two common treatments for dystonia ; neurotoxin injections , such as @entity111 , and deep brain stimulation , which requires an operation to place a neurostimulator in the brain			1
the stimulator sends electrical currents to parts of the brain that control muscle movement			1
certain forms of dystonia have been linked to genetics , environmental or brain damage			1
but scientists are still trying to determine exactly what causes the disorder			1
" what all of us would like , and most especially our patients , is a medication so that they do n't have to get injections or brain surgery , " @entity84 says			1
" that requires that we know something about the cause			0
" cervical dystonia , which causes the neck and sometimes the shoulders to contract involuntarily into uncomfortable positions , is the most common form			1
@entity142 , 46 , says he believes he developed cervical dystonia due to birth complications			1
he did n't begin experiencing symptoms until his teens and was n't properly diagnosed until he was 36			2
" even world - class orthopedists missed this diagnosis by a country mile , " he says			0
@entity142 calls having cervical dystonia a " gift " compared with other forms out there			2
he is able to treat it with quarterly @entity111 injections			0
" there is an emotional aspect to dystonia that people do n't get , " he says			1
" yet there is no guarantee the @entity111 will always be an effective treatment			0
" if you have relief and the symptoms return , that is a level of pain that is hard to describe , " he says			0
" because you know what it is like to feel good			0
" @entity142 is a member of the @entity173 page @entity171 , a closed dystonia support group with about 650 members that @entity1 created in 2012			2
@entity1 says she encouraged the @entity176 to post their stories on @entity0 's @entity178 in honor of @entity180			2
" we are isolated as a whole , " she says of the group and people who suffer from dystonia			1
" we have no support			0
we 're just trying to keep ourselves alive			0
" @entity187 , a mother of two who has a ph.d. in political science , is also a @entity176 member			0
like @entity1 , she has multiple forms of dystonia that affect her neck , limbs and facial muscles			2
she began experiencing symptoms as a child and started seeking medical opinions in her 20s			0
but @entity187 says she was n't diagnosed until her 40s			2
" ( @entity38 ) is devastating to people socially and economically , " the 47 - year - old says			1
" we 're not the glamour illness			0
we do n't have the celebrity spokesman			2
" @entity187 's peers are often shocked to hear she works as a financial adviser , an " assumption " that her visible symptoms are indicative of " lesser intelligence , " she says			2
she bucks her natural tendency to keep personal issues private because she believes raising awareness is key to advancing treatment and a cure			2
" until i know that everybody is diagnosed or have adequate treatments , i 'll keep being a big mouth about this , " she says			0
like @entity142 , @entity187 considers herself fortunate because she has her husband 's support and quality care from a doctor she trusts			2
her symptoms constantly limit basic abilities such as using her hands and legs			0
" i am disabled -- no more , no less , " she says			0
" all of our abilities are temporary			0
" all three agree that the medical community 's lack of understanding of dystonia contributes to the public 's lack of awareness			1
@entity38 's wide variety of forms has caused a lag in research and treatment , says dr. @entity242 , medical director of the @entity243 and professor of neurology at @entity91			1
" there was a period of time in the ' 50s , ' 60s and ' 70s when physicians thought this could be psychogenic , " he says , meaning it originated in the mind			0
" it was a very unfortunate time			0
" @entity242 says that the medical community now understands dystonia 's symptoms are not psychological and that the recent discovery of new genes creates opportunities for advancements in treatment -- and may lead eventually to finding a cure			1
" we 're beginning to understand the molecular disturbances in the brain , " he says			2
identifying the genes that may be involved in dystonia will allow researchers to learn about their different mutations , @entity84 says			2
these findings will then enable scientists to understand better how the mutations alter patients ' biochemistry and how the mutations affect the brain 's normal neurological functions			1
but @entity242 also says that not all forms of dystonia are genetic and so gene mapping is not necessarily a @entity280 for grasping dystonia			2
" i think we 're on the edge of discovery and better therapy , " @entity242 says			0
" some of the new approaches that are coming out will prove very affective for dystonia			2
" more funding and research can not come soon enough for @entity1 , who says her pain is constantly fluctuating between a four and an eight on a scale of 10			0
she can still drive short distances , getting out about three times a week to go grocery shopping and take her son to school			0
in august , she will enter her first art show since being diagnosed with dystonia			2
but she devotes the rest of her time to supporting and encouraging fellow @entity300			0
she says people diagnosed with dystonia need to vocalize what they are going through			1
" my background is all about expressiveness and being creative , " she says			0
" the more you can express yourself , the more healthy you are on a cellular level			0

dystonia is often cloaked in mystery and difficult to diagnose
though it 's the third most common movement disorder , few people understand it
@entity38 's cause is mostly unknown , and there is no cure for it
" you do n't die from dystonia , " one woman says , " but you want to "
