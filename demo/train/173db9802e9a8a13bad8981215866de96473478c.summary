@entity0 -- it 's the punchline of a joke no one bothered to write the set - up for : @entity7 's secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does			1
it 's a joke about the fishnet our tax code turns into when it snares a golden snapper instead of a few million sardines , a joke about the kind of man who still employs a person he refers to as his " secretary " in 2012 and a joke about a rich guy who allegedly cares enough about his secretary 's tax rate that he 'll get behind a government effort to raise his taxes but ca n't bring himself to call her an executive assistant			2
and it 's now the punchline on which the @entity32 administration decided to rest its efforts to increase taxes on the wealthy in an election year			2
what was one semi-faceless woman on the other side of the mahogany doors of @entity7 's office is now a road show featuring four wealthy @entity32 donors and their ( at least in some press accounts ) still - nameless assistants story			1
no one called them " secretaries , " though			0
the word " secretary " conjures up images of a bygone era , of pearls and sweater sets , sensible heels and knee - length skirts , and the right mixture of efficiency and self - effacement to fade into the background while acting as a powerful man 's right hand			1
perhaps that -- and the plethora of lawyers in the city limits -- is why the phrase " @entity7 's secretary " did n't strike any odd notes in @entity0 even as most of the rest of the country would consider the word consigned to the same heap containing " stewardess , " " love child " and " going steady			1
" in 2012 , we do n't celebrate @entity77 ; we celebrate @entity77			0
we have -- when we have administrative support at all , which is increasingly rare in the post-recession hyper - productive economy -- administrative assistants , executive assistants or ( if you 're a celebrity ) personal assistants			0
and while it probably goes without saying that at least a few still fetch coffee for the higher - ups , a fair number of administrative and executive assistants would probably look askance at a boss who asked them to stop answering phones , planning for meetings and dealing with the time - consuming minutiae of keeping an office functioning to do a personal task like that			0
plus , in the modern economy , there 's no longer a secretarial pool : more likely , a group of employees and managers will be pooled together to use the resources of one administrative assistant , who then gets to juggle not only their work demands but their desire to have their demands met before those of their colleagues			2
if you bring five different people coffee on demand , that 's less assisting one 's supervisors and more waiting on them			0
at its core , being an assistant -- or an administrative professional -- is framed as a career upgrade , even if many of the tasks are essentially the same : it 's a way of acknowledging the importance of administrative work and support to the success of many projects and even many people			1
a secretary served one boss -- and it 's the service nature of that categorization that perhaps rubs us the wrong way nowadays -- with both professional tasks and more than a few personal ones			2
" administrative professional " denotes strictly professional assistance ; " secretary " still holds the connotation of " work wife			1
" the phrase " @entity7 's secretary " sounds strange			1
are we supposed to conjure up a modern - day @entity148 , @entity150 , the " sweet " and loyal @entity151 of the @entity153 song or the stern , all - knowing mother - figure of an assistant ? do they still get coffee , buy gifts for relatives , even take dictation ? and how does @entity7 's " secretary " feel about being the invisible half of his political punchline - turned - policy ? if nothing else , @entity166 -- who , despite having a real name , is still known to the world as " @entity7 's secretary " -- seems to have a sense of humor about the whole thing			1
@entity173 , when conservative commentators take her limited role in the fight to raise rich people 's taxes seriously enough that they decided to speculate that she is too rich to be the poster child for the downtrodden , she 'd have to be amused , if she was n't going to get annoyed			0
it 's probably not the first time that her boss ' needs have trumped her personal desires , and at least it netted her a seat at the @entity189			0
but it 's interesting that , even in the wake of the @entity193 calling for more attention to be paid to income inequality , the legislation is still called the @entity196			0
the rule designed to even the playing field by putting @entity7 's taxes on @entity166 's scale is n't called the @entity201 or the @entity202			1
it makes no obvious reference to the people to whom @entity7 is to be made more equal			2
instead , it 's the @entity196			0
it 's about him ; it concerns him ; it affects him ; it takes his name			0
@entity166 will probably go back to being the anonymous secretary of the story ( if she has n't already done so ) , and the legislation inspired by @entity7 's epiphany about her unequal tax rate will get named after him			1
even when legislation is intended to ding the 1 % , it still bears their name , and it 's still with the permission of at least some of them -- whether it be @entity7 or the four donors with whom @entity32 shared the stage this week -- that it 's even on the political agenda			1
it 's not getting pushed because @entity166 deserves it but because @entity7 thinks she deserves it			2
after all , that 's what secretaries do : they fade into the background			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0

@entity235 : political discussion *revolves* around " @entity7 's secretary "
she says the word " secretary " conjures up images of a bygone era , of pearls and sweater sets
this is another case in which a secretary is in *shadows* behind powerful , wealthy man , she says
@entity235 : secretary is a " work wife , " rather than " administrative professional "
