@entity0 , @entity1 -- as you probably heard , @entity4 's keynote speech to the @entity5 was historic			1
it marked the first time that a @entity9 had ever delivered the signature address at that event , and the fact that the 37 - year - old mayor of @entity14 was invited to do so by the @entity15 -- and his twin brother , @entity17 state rep. and congressional candidate @entity18 , was chosen to introduce him -- was a show of respect for @entity22 's largest minority			1
as we @entity23 might say : " @entity25 " -- " it was about time			1
" a majority of @entity23 have voted for the @entity15 candidate in every presidential election dating back to 1960			1
that 's 13 elections , loyally casting votes for strong candidates and weak ones			2
over the last half - century , a lot of @entity15 have owed their political careers to voters with names such as @entity38 , @entity39 or @entity40			2
opinion : what @entity4 can do for @entity43 the speech itself had its golden nuggets -- most of them revolving around family , culture , community			1
it also had its lead trinkets -- policy talk about " investing " in creating opportunity that @entity55 will dismiss as more tax - and - spend rhetoric that was a poor fit for someone being marketed as a leader of the future			2
the gold sounded like this : " my grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid , a cook and a babysitter , barely scraping by , but still working hard to give my mother , her only child , a chance in life , so that my mother could give my brother and me an even better one			0
... and i can still remember her , every morning as @entity18 and i walked out the door to school , making the sign of the cross behind us , saying , ' @entity80			0
' ' may @entity81 bless you			0
... " and this : " my grandmother never owned a house			0
she cleaned other people 's houses so she could afford to rent her own			2
but she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college			2
and my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop , i could hold this microphone			0
" and while she may be proud of me tonight , i 've got to tell you , @entity95 , i 'm even more proud of you			0
today , my beautiful wife , @entity98 , and i are the proud parents of a 3 - year - old little girl , @entity100 , named after my grandmother			0
a couple of mondays ago was her first day of pre- @entity103 as we dropped her off , we walked out of the classroom , and i found myself whispering to her , as was once whispered to me , ' que dios te bendiga			0
' may @entity81 bless you			0
... " but given what had transpired outside the @entity109 in @entity0 a few hours earlier , @entity4 's speech was also bittersweet			1
ten people who identified themselves as illegal immigrants , part of a national caravan dubbed the " @entity114 , " were arrested outside the arena for blocking an intersection and refusing to disperse			0
they were there to protest president @entity43 's immigration policies			1
and because the @entity43 administration 's signature immigration enforcement program , @entity122 , requires local police to submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of arrestees whom they suspect might be in the country illegally , those 10 people could be deported			1
they have names such as @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
there is no question that @entity4 did @entity43 an enormous favor tuesday night by inspiring and energizing @entity9 voters , a majority of whom tell pollsters that they like the president personally but disapprove of his immigration policies -- most notably , a record number of deportations now approaching 1.5 million			1
for @entity23 , those deportations represent more than numbers on a spreadsheet			1
they represent hundreds of thousands of families that have been torn apart and divided across a border , and thousands of @entity22 - born children of illegal immigrants placed in foster care			0
@entity43 broke the first rule of dealing with @entity23 : do n't mess with the family			1
although the latest polls show @entity43 leading @entity163 by more than a 2 - to - 1 margin with @entity23 , the president has developed an enthusiasm gap with those voters			1
and there are really two ways for @entity43 to " lose " the @entity9 vote -- if 40 % of @entity23 vote for @entity163 , or if a large chunk of @entity43 voters are so unenthusiastic about his record in office that they just stay home			1
the first probably wo n't happen			0
a new @entity178 poll found more than 14 % of @entity9 voters are undecided about whom to vote for			0
recently , @entity43 announced a new policy at the @entity182 where illegal immigrants who meet certain qualifications -- less than 31 years of age , no criminal record , came to the @entity22 before the age of 16 , etc. -- can apply for two years of " deferred action " so they 're not deported			1
but not everyone is eligible , and many are too skeptical to participate			0
the good news for the @entity43 campaign is that @entity23 will not soon forget the emotional words @entity4 delivered tuesday night			1
the bad news is they wo n't forget the president 's dreadful immigration record , which made the speech so necessary			1
and that 's the bittersweet part			2
inside the arena , @entity23 heard a beautiful story that reminded us how far we 've come			2
outside the arena , we witnessed an ugly reality that tells us how far we still have to go			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207			2

@entity207 : @entity14 mayor @entity4 's speech inspired , energized @entity23
he says the speech *shined* when @entity4 talked about his family , culture and community
but arrests of 10 *latinos* protesting @entity43 immigration policies *tarnished* mood , he says
he says @entity23 support @entity43 , but their enthusiasm is *waning* over immigration record
