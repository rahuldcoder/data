@entity0 , @entity1 -- cholera has killed 297 people in the west @entity7 nation of @entity1 , health officials said wednesday			1
the outbreak , which began in may , has exceeded 3,000 cases , said dr. @entity10 , the leader of the @entity12 's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team			1
the agency has an office in @entity1			1
" it 's a lot of cases and a lot of deaths , " he said in a telephone interview			2
" more deaths than should be expected under the best of conditions			0
" under ideal conditions , cholera 's fatality rate ought to be less than 1 percent , he said			1
but @entity1 's conditions are not ideal			1
many people live far from the medical aid that could help them rehydrate and replace the sodium and potassium lost in their stools and vomit			0
" that delay can be critical , " @entity10 said			0
" if you do n't get the fluids and the electrolytes replaced through hydration , you can go into shock and die as a result			0
" the country 's northern region has been particularly hard hit			1
three of 10 prisoners diagnosed with cholera at @entity48 in the far north were among the dead , the officials said			2
@entity12 's @entity10 said the rugged and remote region has been affected repeatedly by cholera epidemics , most recently last year			1
about 70 percent of people living in the country 's far north , bordering @entity54 and @entity55 and the @entity56 , do not have access to potable water , according to a @entity60 official			1
sanitation is also limited in the area and recent flooding has aggravated the situation			0
the affected area is home to some 5 million people , according to @entity68			0
outbreaks are now also occurring across the border in parts of @entity54 , @entity10 said			2
" there 's a lot of people crossing over the border all the time , " he said			2
" so it 's not surprising that the cholera is also crossing over the border			2
" the @entity80 children 's agency said it has dispatched emergency medical kits containing surgical gloves , water treatment tablets , cholera medicine , oral rehydration salts and educational materials			1
it said children are especially vulnerable to the disease			2
cholera is spread via the oral - fecal route , through water contaminated with human waste			1
" what puts people at risk is a lack of safe drinking water , " @entity10 said			0
boiling the water or treating it with chlorine or filtration or some other method to remove the contaminants can make it safe			0
untreated , cholera can kill within hours , according to the @entity106			0
worldwide , as many as 120,000 people die each year from cholera			0
