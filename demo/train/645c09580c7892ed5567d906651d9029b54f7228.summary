@entity0 -- frustrated @entity2 went to the @entity4 floor friday to seek @entity6 approval for a long list of administration nominees currently blocked by controversial secret holds placed by @entity6 senators			1
but a @entity6 senator objected to each of them as they came up			2
" most of the people on the list , we do n't know why they 're sitting there			0
we do n't even know who 's making them sit there , " complained sen. @entity19 , @entity20 , who is spearheading @entity22 efforts to banish secret holds			1
" enter stage left , the anonymous hold			0
or as i like to call it , nobody can blame me cause they do n't know who i am			0
" @entity19 said the delay in approving these nominees is particularly agonizing because most of them passed out of committee with little or no opposition			0
" if there is a legitimate complaint or grievance against any nominee , i think any senator has a right to be heard and appeal to the body for a vote , " sen. @entity39 of @entity40 , the number two @entity41 , said thursday			0
" but secret holds , i think , have become a reprehensible part of the process here and need to end			1
" sen. @entity55 , @entity56 , was the lone @entity6 on the floor friday during the nearly two - hour debate on the issue			2
he objected to @entity22 requests to approve the nominees not because he personally opposes them but " as courtesy to people on my side of the aisle who have problems with some of these nominees			0
" @entity55 said @entity6 have a right to a public debate on nominees they oppose and @entity2 are trying to get around that by seeking unanimous consent to quickly confirm them			1
in fact , @entity55 won praise from @entity19 because she said he is the only @entity6 senator who has made his holds public			1
@entity2 are especially upset because they think most @entity6 are getting around a @entity4 rule adopted three years ago that requires senators to make public their holds once they 've had them in place for six legislative days			1
sen. @entity83 , @entity84 , called the practice " hold - laundering , " which is when senators rotate a secret hold off to one another before hitting the six - day trigger for making their names public and thereby keep a hold in place indefinitely			0
@entity6 do n't deny using the method but argue it 's allowed by @entity4 rules which could be changed if @entity2 want			1
" if they think the rule needs to be tightened up they can offer to change the rule , " suggested a @entity6 leadership aide			2
in fact , @entity2 said an effort is under way to offer an amendment to the financial regulations bill currently on the floor to shorten the six - day window to two days			2
@entity2 complain the secret holds keep the @entity108 administration from being able to effectively govern and point to one nominee , @entity109 , to be the no. 2 official at the @entity111 , as an example of a key appointee stalled by an anonymous senator			1
at a news conference on thursday , @entity39 said that @entity6 that day had finally lifted a hold and approved the nomination of a top @entity119 official only after feeling pressured because of the oil spill in the @entity121			0
" if they 're going to move this appointee ... because of an oil spill , what does it take to move the deputy administrator of the @entity111 in charge of air safety , " @entity39 asked			0
" fill in the blanks			0
" asked about @entity22 concerns over the issue earlier this week , senate republican leader @entity130 of @entity131 acknowledged , " we 've always had a challenging environment in the @entity4 with regard to the confirmation of executive branch appointments			0
this administration 's been treated about the same as previous administrations in terms of the pace of confirmations			0
" @entity2 disputed that notion and cited figures suggesting @entity108 's nominees are moving slower than @entity147 's at this time in his presidency			1
a top @entity6 senator accused @entity2 also of using rotating holds			1
" what i have run into in trying to get a bill or an amendment in the @entity4 in the past is the same practice , " said sen. @entity151 of @entity152 , the fourth - ranking @entity6 in the @entity4			1
" where the @entity2 would have a hold on it and you try to trace it down and you kind of have an idea of who it might be and you go to them , [ they respond ] ' no i do n't , ' and nobody ever knew because it was just rotated around			2

@entity2 seek approval of nominees they say @entity6 is blocking
republicans do n't deny holding up process , argue it 's allowed by @entity4 rules
@entity2 say secret holds keep @entity108 administration from being able to effectively govern
@entity6 say @entity2 use the same *tactic*
