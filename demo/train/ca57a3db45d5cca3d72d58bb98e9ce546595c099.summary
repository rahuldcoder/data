-- amid the mish - mash of potential presidential contenders at last weekend 's @entity4 , pundit @entity1 did n't disappoint her supporters by brandishing once again the language of racialist politics			1
it was no surprise that she used immigration reform to inflame the right			1
she has depicted @entity11 as " a deluge of unskilled immigrants pouring into the country , " and she 'll explain to anyone who will listen that immigrants are looking for little more than the next government handout			0
her deep ignorance of both the @entity20 community and immigration reform is shameful			1
among her fiery comments was an attack on @entity28 politicians @entity30 sen. @entity29 , the " endless @entity31 , " @entity22 's gov. @entity21 and others who have publicly voiced support for immigration reform			1
@entity32 alleged that @entity28 politicians are speaking out in favor of immigration reform because they " panicked " reacting to the lackluster voter support last november			1
and , she proudly announced , from now on she will be a single - issue voter against " amnesty for illegals			0
" but just a few days later , her remarks seem especially out of touch , given the report released monday by the @entity28 entitled " @entity43			1
" as opposed to @entity32 's assessment of panic in the ranks , it seems that finally @entity28 are waking up and taking a clear - eyed view to how to keep their party alive			1
the report prescribes an overhaul of the party , including a flat - out endorsement of immigration reform			1
the party , the report states , " must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform , " including a recommended $ 10 million outreach effort that includes hiring national political directors for @entity20 , @entity61 and @entity63 - @entity62 voters			1
for the past several years , many members of the @entity28 have rejected any kind of immigration package that would legalize the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the @entity62			2
some of those politicians ( including @entity69 ) have gone so far as to support state anti-immigrant laws that sought " self - deportation , " like @entity72 's @entity71			0
drawing this type of arbitrary line in the sand against any kind of legalization proposal seriously damaged the @entity28 's reputation among the @entity20 voting bloc , which overwhelmingly supported @entity81 for president			2
which is why the party is changing its tone			0
republicans like @entity87 , @entity29 and @entity21 are following the footsteps of @entity89 in recognizing that the way to move this country forward lies in the sometimes messy , complicated task of seeking a solution to the immigration problem , not in bright - line denouncements like @entity32 's sound bites			1
and in a significant move on monday , tea party favorite sen. @entity97 , who just won the @entity100 - @entity4 presidential preference straw poll , endorsed a pathway to citizenship for the nation 's 11 million undocumented immigrants			0
contrary to what @entity32 would have the @entity4 audience believe , prominent @entity28 leaders are not panicked ; they are looking for commonsense ways to tackle the broken immigration system , and have clearly stated that they are not interested in giving anyone a free pass to legalization			1
they 've made it clear that any possible immigration package requires additional measures to secure the border , hefty fees for undocumented immigrants and a lengthy waiting period before eligible applicants are permitted to regularize their immigration status in the @entity62			0
along these lines , on monday , @entity28 members of the @entity128 's @entity127 pushed to augment the period of time that an undocumented person would have to maintain legal permanent residency before applying for citizenship			2
the proposal extends the current waiting period from eight to 10 years			0
the negotiated time frame would permit applicants to naturalize three years after gaining legal permanent residency for a total of a 13 - year path to citizenship			0
this proposal is on par with the current citizenship process , except that it would extend the period for permanent residency and shorten the period for naturalization			0
this development underscores the fact that the @entity28 does not support a fast - track legalization plan for people who are unlawfully present in the country			2
despite @entity32 's assurances to the contrary , the negotiated principles that @entity29 and other members of the @entity128 's @entity127 have proposed are not attempts to provide " amnesty to illegals			2
" the republicans who support the measures are not weak or desperate			0
instead , they are demonstrating leadership by looking for a smart solution to a complex problem by trying to reach a fair , yet stern , deal with @entity169 politicians			0
@entity32 's smug rally to become " single - issue voters " smacks of panic she accuses others of experiencing			0
her take on immigration is exactly the kind of ill - informed and short - sighted stance that has caused the @entity28 to lose supporters			2
she ca n't be pleased with the timing of the release of her own party 's report , which proclaims in no uncertain terms that immigration reform must be embraced , not dismantled			1
it is @entity1 's views that are truly out of step with the leadership and the goals of the only party that will have her			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

pundit @entity1 *criticized* @entity28 leaders about their stance on immigration reform
@entity203 : it is @entity32 who is out of touch with the goals of the @entity28
he says the @entity28 is endorsing immigration reform with a newly released report
@entity197 : prominent @entity28 see the need to reform a problem that needs repair
