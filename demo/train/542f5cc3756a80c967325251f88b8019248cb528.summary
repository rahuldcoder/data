editor 's note : @entity2 won the 2008 @entity3 for " @entity4 of @entity5 : an @entity14 , " a book the award judges said , " is more than the story of @entity7 and his house slave @entity8 ; it is a deeply moral and keenly intelligent probe of the harsh yet all - too - human world they inhabited and the bloodline they share			1
" she is a law professor at @entity18 and a history professor at @entity20 , and editor of " @entity22 : @entity23 in @entity24			2
" @entity2 says @entity26 's election reshapes perceptions about race in @entity29			1
( @entity30 ) -- by now , it has become almost a clich√© : " i never thought i 'd live to see it happen			2
" that common reaction to the election of @entity26 , an @entity37 , to the presidency of the @entity29 captures much about the country 's troubled racial history			1
black people have been a presence on the @entity44 continent from the early 1600s , and the 1500s if you count the @entity48 settlement at @entity49 , @entity50			0
yet , the fact that we were brought to @entity29 as slaves and had to wage a centuries - long battle for freedom -- and then for civic and civil rights -- has often shaped perceptions about what is and is not possible for blacks to achieve			0
it has also shaped views about what whites as a group will and will not tolerate when it comes to black advancement , as if the races were in a zero - sum competition ; any black " gain " seems to be viewed automatically as a " loss " to whites			0
true , the president - elect did not get a majority of white votes , and much opposition to him was clearly based upon his race -- sometimes shockingly so			1
one of my most poignant memories of the campaign will always be an exchange i had with a friend who had gone to @entity82 to canvass for @entity26			1
the experience was at once exhilarating and disheartening to him			0
an idealistic young white man who had grown up in a progressive community , he was happy to have a candidate he could support enthusiastically , yet he found himself crestfallen when would - be voters told him flatly that they would never vote for a black man for president			0
not that @entity26 's political views were anathema to them , or that he did not have enough experience : his race alone was a deal breaker			1
the question , from the moment it was clear that @entity26 was a serious contender , was just how many @entity29 were like the people my young friend encountered			1
all over the world , those who figured such people represented the majority of white @entity29 , asked , " will they ( meaning whites , obviously ) let him win ? " singer @entity108 of the @entity109 reportedly answered that question , saying in @entity110 that while she really liked @entity26 , she knew her " people " ( again , meaning , whites ) and they would not allow him to win			1
in the end , no critical mass of eligible white voters came out to defend the @entity116 as " whites - only " territory			2
the possible legions fulfilling the expectation of the " @entity121 " -- when prospective voters tell pollsters they might vote for a black candidate , intending all the while to vote for the white candidate -- never materialized			2
or , if they did , their votes were not enough to change the outcome			0
the @entity26 candidacy was essentially a bet that the conventional wisdom about what we " knew " of white @entity29 was faulty			1
" @entity138 " could mean many things , but it was certainly an ingenious way to address the racial question			2
it called on black and white alike to ignore edicts imposed from the outside about what they were " supposed " to do , think and feel			0
this was a bigger hurdle for whites			0
blacks have been voting for whites for as long as we have been allowed to vote			2
while race could remain a factor for whites , in today 's world , it might not trump everything			2
concerns about an unpopular war , fatigue with the party in power , the lack of enthusiasm for the candidates on the opposing ticket and sheer terror as the economy slid into the abyss might loom as more important than a candidate 's color , if one had the right candidate			0
make no mistake : the times we live in fostered @entity26 's triumph			1
the country has had unpopular wars , bad candidates and shaky economic times before , and it is safe to say that no black candidate , no matter how talented , could have been elected president during those earlier times			0
@entity26 's success is evidence that the @entity29 has changed in important ways			1
it does not , however , signal the death of racism in the country , anymore than the passages of the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments to the @entity193 , the decision in @entity195 , or the enactment of the civil rights provisions of the 1960s ended the struggle against racial prejudice			1
each of those momentous events , considered almost miraculous in their time , brought vibrant hopes that were far too often dashed			0
they were just beginnings , means to an end that was yet to come			2
racism is no easy foe			1
the election of one man will not , by itself , be enough to overcome the history that has given race its meaning in the @entity29			1
it is clear , however , that we must edit our narrative about race			2
we , all of us , must reconsider the things we say people can do and can not do today , because of the truths we know about our past			0
the election of 2008 is evidence that many @entity29 may be willing to do that ; to chart a new course on the question of race			1
i am not totally surprised			0
back in 1997 , when i started traveling the country speaking about my first book , " @entity7 and @entity8 : an @entity238 , " i braced myself for the hostility i anticipated from whites who might not be able to accept that our third president had children with an enslaved @entity37 - @entity44 woman			0
instead , many people -- most typically @entity240 whites -- came out to tell me about their " @entity248 " type family histories , eager to contribute to a more truthful account of what has happened between the races from this country 's beginnings			0
impulses to truth and reconciliation , wherever found and however expressed , should be nurtured			0
a better future depends upon it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity26 bet perception of racial **barriers** was faulty
she says the " @entity264 effect " never materialized in voting booths
race is not an easy foe , and this is not the end of racism , she says
she says the election calls for *rethinking* what racial **barriers** still exist
