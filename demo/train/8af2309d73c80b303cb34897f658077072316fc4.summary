forty years ago , @entity0 was the top major at @entity2			2
today it 's not even in the top five			2
history majors there have fallen by more than half in the last decade			1
at @entity9 , humanities majors fell from 14 % of students in 1966 to 7 % in 2010			1
and it 's not just the @entity12			2
every month there seems to be a new report on how liberal arts and the humanities are disappearing from @entity18 colleges and universities			1
academics everywhere are asking each other anxiously what they can do to reverse the decline			2
but they 're asking the wrong people the wrong question			2
instead of talking mainly to other elites , champions of a well - rounded liberal arts education should be speaking directly and more creatively to the public			1
the question they should be asking is this : do you realize you are missing out on a golden pathway to influence and purpose ? and this : do you realize you 're going to need us soon to rescue the @entity18 ? this is brave talk , i know , considering that the share of students majoring in the humanities has been shrinking dramatically			1
the reasons are well known and seemingly unstoppable : as higher education has gotten far more expensive , parents and legislators demand better " return on investment			2
" the greater the focus on @entity49 , the more attention is paid to " strategic " fields with obvious employment prospects , like business and computer science			0
and the more that happens , the less interest there is in fields like @entity0 , philosophy and , as president @entity59 himself mockingly noted , art history			0
i have nothing against the @entity63 of science , technology , engineering and math. nor do i think a business or marketing degree is inherently useless			0
but the rush to " practical " education , which has accelerated since the @entity72 , arises not so much from optimism about what science and technology can do for our country but from anxiety about falling behind in a time of severe inequality			1
when a society like @entity18 becomes ever more winner - takes - all , panic starts to set in			1
people obsess over declines in relative status			0
they forget why we educate children			0
they forget what made ( and can still make ) our country exceptional			0
a liberal arts education has its roots , etymologically and otherwise , in the requirements of liberty : what it takes to be a self - governing citizen rather than a slave			1
to be a citizen of a country like the @entity18 you should be literate in the humanities as well as the sciences , in the arts as well as accounting			1
willful illiteracy is civic malpractice			0
to disparage liberal arts , as politicians often do , is to disparage citizenship itself			1
and though it may seem populist to champion so - called practical fields , there 's nothing more elitist than saying that most people ca n't benefit from a liberal arts education			1
this is why it 's frustrating how poorly some humanities champions make their case , especially when they do so on terms set by the very marketplace that devalues them			2
it is true -- perhaps surprisingly -- that liberal arts majors , during their peak earning years , make more money than people who studied pre-professional fields			1
but i believe those who study the humanities also end up being great citizens , leaders and creators			2
a humanities education offers very few skills except for those that ca n't be automated			1
a humanities education offers very little job security except for the ability to adapt to changing circumstances			1
you should study history only if you 're interested in how people exercise power over one another			2
you should study literature only if you 're interested in understanding the motivations of your friends , family , colleagues and competitors			0
you should study art and art history only if you 're interested in seeing patterns others do n't or ca n't			0
you should study theater only if you 're interested in knowing how to read and send cues in social situations			0
you should study philosophy only if you 're interested in creating the explanatory frameworks within which everyone else lives			0
you should study music only if you 're interested in having a voice			0
but do n't take my word for it			0
ask @entity59 ( political science ) , @entity176 ( @entity0 and history ) , @entity178 ( art history ) , @entity180 ( speech and drama ) , @entity183 ( philosophy and theater ) , @entity186 ( classics ) , @entity188 ( @entity0 literature ) or @entity190 ( psychology )			0
as @entity18 worry ever more about keeping up , whether because of inequality at home or competition from @entity196 , we should heed the example of @entity198			1
@entity198 did n't have to be one of the world 's best software coders			1
all he had to do was develop the vision that would attract some of the world 's most talented coders			0
@entity196 can manufacture all the planet 's iphones			0
americans still imagine and design them			0
that 's an advantage we have to cultivate in our colleges			0
as @entity198 once said , " technology alone is not enough -- it 's technology married with liberal arts , married with the humanities , that yields us the result that makes our heart sing			1

some reports say that a liberal arts education in the @entity18 is losing *luster*
@entity223 : kids are missing out on a golden pathway to power , purpose
he says the rush to " practical " majors stem from anxiety about falling behind
*liu* : just look at @entity198 , who valued humanities and creativity over coding
