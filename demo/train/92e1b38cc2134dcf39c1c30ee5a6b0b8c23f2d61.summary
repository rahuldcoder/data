@entity0 , @entity1 -- winds and rain associated with @entity5 lashed @entity1 on sunday ahead of the storm 's arrival , forecasters said , as the island braced for a potential direct hit			1
the official weather - observing site on @entity1 reported sustained winds of 54 mph ( 87 kph ) with a gust to 67 mph ( 107 kph ) , the @entity11 said			1
a gust of 89 mph ( 143 kph ) was earlier reported at an elevated observation site			2
as of 8 p.m. et sunday , @entity5 's center was about 60 miles ( 95 kilometers ) west - southwest of @entity1 and moving north at about 14 mph ( 22 kph )			1
the storm was a category 1 hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 kph ) , and forecasters said its intensity was not expected to diminish before it approached @entity1			1
@entity5 was also very large , forecasters said -- hurricane - force winds extended outward up to 90 miles ( 150 kilometers ) from the center and tropical storm - force winds outward up to 345 miles ( 555 kilometers )			1
as of sunday afternoon , @entity2 meteorologist @entity28 in @entity1 said the island was being battered by wind gusts and experiencing heavy surf			1
the airport was closed , and the capital of @entity34 was " a ghost town			0
" it was estimated that half of the island 's 67,000 people had lost power , he said			1
the island will bear the brunt of @entity5 , particularly its most destructive northeast quadrant , regardless of whether the storm makes landfall , he said			1
it is hoped that not much structural damage would result , as @entity1 does " an incredible job in terms of hurricane - proofing their structures , " said @entity2 meteorologist @entity54			1
@entity2 ireporter @entity55 in @entity1 showed video of rough surf churning at @entity59 , @entity1 , ahead of the storm 's arrival			2
@entity62 said she lives up the street from the bay , but her home 's windows were taped and she has " plenty of supplies " on hand			2
another ireporter , @entity71 , shot video of palm trees swaying in the wind from her balcony in @entity77 , @entity1 , sunday morning			2
@entity71 said she lives in a sheltered area , not near the water , so the effects might be worse closer to shore			0
the weather is " steadily deteriorating , " she said , but she is prepared			0
" most people have stayed indoors since last night , " she said , adding that " driving conditions are very dangerous			0
" " there is also some flying debris already so it 's too dangerous to walk either , " she said			0
" all of our storm shutters are secured , the cupboards are stocked with tinned and boxed food , and the baths and jugs have been filled with water			0
there is really nothing more we can do at this point to prepare			0
we just have to wait it out and hope for the best			0
" the center of @entity5 is projected to pass over or near @entity1 sunday night			1
@entity103 conditions are expected to continue throughout the evening , the hurricane center said			0
a hurricane warning was in effect			1
" a direct hit would be the worst - case scenario , because the island would have to endure the extremely strong winds in the eye wall , as well as a dangerously high storm surge , " @entity2 meteorologist @entity106 said			1
in order for a hurricane to make landfall , the center of its eye must come ashore , said @entity2 meteorologist @entity119			2
if the center does not come ashore , but the eye wall moves over the island , it would be considered a direct hit			1
" @entity1 could experience the strongest winds without @entity5 ever making landfall , " he said			1
" it is also possible that @entity1 may not experience landfall or a direct hit			1
" the hurricane center did not offer an estimate for how high the storm surge is forecast to be , but said it will produce " significant coastal flooding " and will be accompanied by " large and destructive waves , " particularly on the southern coast			0
@entity5 is forecast to dump 6 to 9 inches of rain on the island			2
meanwhile , large swells are expected to affect the @entity140 of the @entity141 through monday			0
swells will subside over the next couple of days in locations including the @entity144 , @entity145 , the @entity146 , @entity147 and portions of the @entity149 , forecasters said , but may cause dangerous surf and rip currents			0
tracking maps show @entity5 remaining off the coast of the @entity141 , possibly brushing the tip of @entity156 , @entity157 , next week			2
farther east in the @entity159 , @entity158 continued spinning with considerably less threat to land than @entity5			2
as of 5 p.m. sunday , a weakened @entity158 was located about 1,280 miles ( 2,055 kilometers ) west of the @entity161			0
it was headed northeast at about 14 mph ( 22 kph )			0
its winds had decreased to 45 mph ( 75 mph )			0
