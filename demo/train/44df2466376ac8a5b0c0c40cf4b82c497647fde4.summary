@entity1 's ' party boy ' son under scrutiny " my tuition and living expenses at @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity19 were funded exclusively by two sources -- scholarships earned independently , and my mother 's generosity from the savings she earned from her years as a successful lawyer and writer , " he said			1
