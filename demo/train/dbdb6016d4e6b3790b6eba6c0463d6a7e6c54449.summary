-- what will @entity2 's @entity1 look like ? the country 's prime minister - in - waiting -- a staunch @entity6 nationalist and the chief minister of the western state of @entity9 since 2001 -- is a deeply polarizing figure and an unproven commodity on the international stage			1
analysts predict his arrival in the country 's top office will bring a marked change in direction for the world 's most populous democracy , a nation whose modern character has been defined by the inclusive , secular and liberal approach of the @entity25 , which has governed for most of the post-independence era			1
the only question , they say , is how great a departure @entity2 's premiership will be from what has come before			2
" there will be a big change , " analyst and journalist @entity31 told @entity0 ahead of his @entity33 's ( @entity33 ) crushing victory at the polls			0
the @entity33 finished with 282 of 543 parliamentary seats , giving it a clear majority -- something no other @entity1 political party has achieved in three decades			2
" the desire for change very clearly ( is there ) ... i think people are looking for another kind of government , " said @entity31			0
" his vision for @entity1 is not the kind of inclusive , secularist vision that we have been used to -- it is a much more right - wing , @entity54 vision , " she said			2
" i ... see an increase in social tension with groups that are not included in his vision			0
" administrator - in - chief the 63 - year - old former tea seller 's immense popularity -- a @entity64 survey ahead of the elections found nearly 80 % of respondents held a positive view of him -- stems in large part from his reputation as a tough , " can - do " administrator , the man with the medicine to kickstart @entity1 's stuttering economy			1
" @entity2 is a good administrator , " said @entity75 , author of an unauthorized biography of the politician			2
" he is very strict , gets things done			0
there is a fear element			0
" his popularity comes in spite of a lack of strong personal charisma			0
seen as a hardworking and conservative technocrat , @entity2 had failed to establish an " emotional connect " with voters during campaigning , said @entity31			2
instead , his claim to the nation 's top office has largely rested on his track record since 2001 in charge of @entity9 , a state of some 60 million people whose @entity94 - like rates of growth in recent years have been eyed enviously by the rest of the country			1
' the @entity9 model ' the so - called " @entity9 model " of development means a focus on infrastructure , urbanization and eradicating red tape -- seen as a much - needed tonic for a country ranked 179th in the world by the @entity106 in terms of ease of starting a business			1
a sharp contrast to the traditional approach of the outgoing @entity25 -- which has focused on promoting inclusive growth involving a raft of welfare schemes -- it 's proven highly attractive to business			2
@entity1 stocks have risen almost 18 % this year at the prospect of a @entity2 - led government			1
@entity1 's largest conglomerate , the @entity122 , relocated a car plant into the state four years ago , a move the company 's former chairman @entity126 credits in part to @entity2 's involvement			1
" in effect , ( @entity2 ) delivered in three days what other states which were also trying to woo us could only offer their best endeavors to do , " he told @entity0 's @entity131			2
" no side deals , no quid pro quos			0
" the promise of economic development is just as enticing to the public , and resonates particularly with the increasingly strident aspirations of the 100 million young voters who were eligible to cast their ballots for the first time in 2014 , said @entity147 , director of the @entity148 at the @entity149			0
" these young voters are exposed through electronic media to the whole world , and have a dream of moving forward -- not lagging behind as their fathers and grandfathers have for decades			0
" greater inequality ? but not everyone is convinced about @entity2 's economic prescription			1
@entity160 , a political analyst at @entity162 's @entity161 , told @entity0 that @entity2 's record in @entity9 has been overhyped			1
" there is no ' @entity9 model , ' and there are other states with faster economic growth , " he said during an interview in the build - up to the election			1
moreover , many feel that economic development in the state has been unequally distributed , and not matched with corresponding gains in human development			0
" it really is a model that favors people who already have access to things like education and business possibilities , " said @entity31			0
" he offers very little to the poor , to the weaker section and i think that this is a major weakness			0
" while she believed @entity2 's leadership would see an increase in foreign and domestic investment , his corporate agenda would also likely lead to conflict with @entity1 's vocal civil society groups			1
" i see a rise in social tension because people have become much more conscious and they do n't want to to give up their land so easily just because @entity2 wants to clear the way forward for business , " she said			0
" there will be tension over forest land , there will be tension over agricultural land ... it will be a very interesting thing to see how he manages the challenges			0
" too autocratic ? @entity2 's hard - nosed , occasionally abrasive leadership style will also present a marked departure for a country accustomed to a more consensus - driven approach , analysts believe			1
" i see @entity2 as an extraordinarily ambitious man , quite ruthless in the pursuit of his ambition , " said @entity31			0
@entity160 , who knows @entity2 personally , likens his vision of a " right - wing , authoritarian corporate state " as closer to the model in @entity94 , and questions whether his divisive , autocratic tendencies will translate well in a country as boisterously democratic as @entity1			1
" it 's not a place where you can press buttons -- you have to work with people , " he said			0
" the prime minister of india has to be the supreme conciliator , reconciling the aspirations and demands of thousands of groups			1
it 's not like @entity94 where you can turn off @entity233 one day -- you ca n't be autocratic or they 'll cut you out			0
" journalist and blogger @entity235 also sees @entity2 as a challenge to the country 's established liberal , secular order , writing in a @entity0 opinion piece that the signs were there that his government would " be much less tolerant of criticism , hostile towards press freedom , and further polarize the country along religious lines			1
" opinion : does @entity2 threaten secular and liberal @entity1 ? @entity2 and @entity250 the greatest concerns about a @entity2 premiership revolve around his ability , as a hardline @entity6 nationalist , to lead a country as culturally and religiously diverse as @entity1			1
since he was a boy -- the third of six children born to a family of grocers in the city of @entity261 -- @entity2 has been a supporter of the @entity262 ( @entity262 ) , a right - wing @entity54 social movement			2
his track record with @entity1 's 180 million - strong @entity250 community , the country 's second largest religious group , has come under intense scrutiny			1
less than a year after @entity2 assumed office in @entity9 in late 2001 , the state was wracked with @entity272 violence , in which more than 1,000 people , mostly @entity250 , were killed			1
@entity2 was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence , but a @entity276 - ordered investigation absolved him of blame last year			2
@entity2 subsequently expressed regret over the riots but was criticized for not apologizing			0
the @entity280 denied @entity2 a visa in 2005 over the issue , but after his win , @entity284 president @entity283 called @entity2 to congratulate him and invite him to @entity286 , according to the @entity287			0
the tensions are not merely a relic of the past			0
as recently as september last year , more than 60 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced in religious riots in the @entity295 district of @entity297 state			0
most of the affected were @entity250			0
@entity235 notes that during the election campaign , @entity2 appeared alongside associates including a @entity302 politician who made inflammatory speeches speaking of " revenge " for the 2002 riots and called on voters to reject parties with @entity250 candidates			1
amid what many see as a rising tide of intolerance drummed up by @entity6 nationalist groups , some @entity250 fear what a @entity2 - led government means for their community			1
" we all remember what he did in @entity9 , " one unnamed @entity250 man told @entity0			1
" for @entity250 , @entity2 represents death			1
" @entity31 said she saw religious tensions becoming more inflamed under @entity2 's leadership			2
" i see these @entity6 groups getting much more active ; i think there will be renewed agitation to build the temple at @entity325			0
" @entity325 , in @entity297 , is the site of plot of land that has been the subject of a longstanding dispute between @entity6 and @entity250			2
@entity6 hardliners destroyed an historic mosque on the site during a political rally in 1992 , triggering riots across the country in which more than 2,000 people were killed			2
noisy neighborhood @entity2 's nationalist outlook -- informed by " a sense of victimhood , that we 've been victimized by foreigners " -- would also likely be reflected in @entity1 's foreign policy , @entity160 told @entity0			1
" internationally , he would be a little more hardline on everything -- @entity346 , @entity94 , @entity284			0
@entity1 interests would be aggressively asserted , " he said			0
@entity31 said @entity2 's foreign policy focus would be on @entity1 's neighborhood , which had been " in a lot of turmoil			1
" it 's politically quite unstable and a lot of @entity1 's internal terrorist problems stem from the fact that our borders are so porous , " she said			1
" that has to be the primary challenge for anybody who comes to power			0

@entity1 's prime minister - in - waiting @entity2 is a polarizing figure
critics say the *pro-business* @entity6 nationalist is a threat to secular , liberal traditions
he led the state of @entity9 through a period of strong economic growth
but his relationship with the country 's huge @entity250 minority has come under scrutiny
