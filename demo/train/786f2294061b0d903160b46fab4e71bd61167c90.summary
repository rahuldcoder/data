@entity0 , @entity1 -- the harsh reality of life and death in @entity6 is a common theme for @entity9 filmmakers			1
a still from " @entity11 , " the first commerical animation to come out of the @entity12			2
but it was the 2004 death of a young @entity9 woman -- not at the hands of a militant attack or an @entity18 incursion -- that struck a note with two filmmakers			1
their animated film , " @entity11 , " is inspired by her struggle with breast cancer , which is still a sensitive subject in the @entity9 territories			1
" the amount of trouble she has to go to just to survive , you feel somehow committed to be part of that project , it is so strong and so emotional , " director @entity34 told @entity2			0
@entity11 , which tells the fictional story of a young seamstress from a @entity6 refugee camp , is the first commercial @entity9 animation film ever made			1
the heart - wrenching tale follows @entity11 's pain and humiliation as she struggles to leave @entity6 for treatment after finding few @entity9 doctors willing to help			1
at first , one doctor suggests she loosen her bra , while another says her condition will probably go away once she marries			2
it takes six months for @entity9 doctors to treat her concerns seriously and diagnose her with breast cancer			1
@entity11 becomes tied up in @entity18 and @entity9 bureaucracy , denied treatment until it is too late			1
it is a devastating tale that @entity34 said is not unique			0
" the @entity57 refugee camp , which exists in @entity6 ... represents any refugee camp and [ @entity11 ] could be any woman , " he said			1
" the story could happen again			0
" the film 's executive producer @entity61 said it was a gamble telling such a tragic story using animation			0
but he believes that bet has paid off			0
" i think the animation has softened the harshness of the topic , " he said			0
" breast cancer and illness and death and @entity6 and the siege , it 's all heavy stuff , it 's all harsh stuff			1
put it in an animation style , give it a new dimension , give it a new perspective			0
" at a screening in the @entity1 city of @entity0 , audience members wept after hearing @entity11 's story , saying they related to her plight			2
one scene shows @entity11 checking her breast for lumps			2
the filmmakers hope this will help to break down barriers around a subject that is still very hidden in the region			1
" it 's very taboo to speak about the woman 's body in @entity9 society , but in the film it happens and nobody criticizes and nobody says anything about it , " @entity61 said			2
" the film breaks new ground by dealing with matters often swept under the carpet in @entity9 society			0
@entity61 said the film 's greatest endorsement came from the father of the woman whose real - life story inspired the film			0
the woman 's father said he cried when he watched it			0
" it 's a very human story and if it can touch the real family , it is a great moment , " @entity61 said .			0
