quick : guess how old @entity2 is ? i 'll give you two hints : forty - ish , you say ? forty - five , maybe ? nope , 52			1
and is n't it incredible that someone that age -- or , anyone of any age , really -- could become the countercultural voice of multiple generations , from the millennials to the boomers			1
@entity2 announced on tuesday his departure as host of @entity18 's " @entity17			1
" incredibly , he 'd recently started his 17th year on the show			2
in his signature gen @entity22 style , he joked that that was the longest he 'd held any single job -- " by 16 years and five months			2
" it 's not like @entity2 's dead			1
@entity28 even gone from the show yet			2
that may not happen until later much later this year , he said			2
i feel no need to eulogize him			2
but the thought of nightly cable tv without him is a bit stunning -- for me , age 32 , and for people of all ages , really , who get frustrated with the stilted earnestness of old - timey news programs , and who , likewise , are turned off by televised shouting matches and hype			1
he 's a transcendent figure , in that sense			2
someone who makes sense to the @entity51 set			2
and someone my dad might talk about over a round of golf			2
he 'll be missed by everyone but the 2016 @entity58 candidates			1
on wednesday morning , i asked my @entity60 friends and followers what he meant to them			2
several , including a former classmate , said he helped them process the 9/11 terrorist attack			2
" ( @entity69 ) hen i was a terrified college freshman on 9/11 , @entity2 's was the voice that made sense , " wrote @entity67			1
a @entity60 user identified as @entity73 posted a photo of @entity2 visiting his base in @entity76 a decade later , in 2011			1
" his news is honest			0
he 's honest , " wrote a woman identified as @entity79			0
" which is so incredibly rare in this world now			0
he has a genuine heart for humanity			0
his broadcast of a little girl with autism who he afforded the opportunity to sing with @entity88 , will forever bring tears to my eyes			0
" the satirical form @entity2 pioneered will , of course , live on			1
it may well survive in @entity2 's own work			1
in his farewell , @entity2 said he was going to spend time eating meals with his family -- " who , " he said , " i have heard from multiple sources , are lovely people			1
" he also left open the idea that he could work again			0
" i do n't have any specific plans , " he said			0
" i 've got a lot of ideas			0
" but the form surely lives on in his impressive cast of alums			0
@entity112 's @entity111 show " @entity115 " is among the finest , smartest ( and awesomely angriest ) pieces of social criticism that exists today			0
just watch him skewer the @entity117 pageant			0
this is sharp investigative journalism , made funny and relevant			0
@entity119 , meanwhile , is about to get a higher profile on the " @entity121 , " and we can only hope that he makes that program a little edgier and more interesting than it was under the sleepy - eyed watch of @entity126			1
plus , there 's always an upside to change			0
i hope that @entity2 's departure from " @entity17 " may usher in a new era -- in which the viewpoints of a younger generation are represented not just by old - ish white men but by actual younger people			1
hopefully , too , the @entity138 era will include more women , more racial minorities and more @entity142 people			1
this country laughs with @entity2 , @entity112 and @entity119			1
but they do n't really represent all of us			0
those critiques will have their day , surely			0
today , however , i think it 's important to celebrate the political satire that @entity2 ushered in			1
we 've all gotten a good laugh out of it			0
and , importantly , our democracy is better for it			0
@entity2 , after all , was n't just in it for the jokes			1
he asked tough questions of politicians			0
found ways to make uninterested people care about politics			0
and he did it with a zany , effortless wit			0
instead of a " moment of zen , " the odd - ball segment that usually concludes " @entity17 , " i 'll leave you instead with this clip of @entity2 's farewell to his live audience			1
when you hear the crowd moan , that 's because they realize , too , that he was the voice of so many generations			1
and , thankfully , his was a voice that did n't take itself too seriously .			1

@entity179 : @entity2 is the voice of millennials as well as baby boomers
he will be missed as he departs from his post at " @entity17 "
but hopefully this will usher in a more - *diverse* era of @entity189 satire , @entity179 says
