-- @entity2 smartphones can do a lot , but unless you 're already an @entity2 power user or enjoy configuring a sophisticated device , getting set up on your first @entity2 phone is probably a bit of an ordeal			0
speaking from experience , it 's definitely not as simple or straightforward as getting started with your first @entity13			0
@entity15 aims to ease the setup process with @entity17 , a service launched this month for the carrier 's new mid-range @entity2 phones			1
in a nutshell , @entity15 is providing preconfigured packages of apps , wallpaper , icons , ringtones and premium content ( through partnerships with major media brands )			1
@entity17 packs are free to download and install , but users are charged for premium content and features delivered through those packs			1
users can customize their own phones further , and you can load up to to five @entity17 packs on a device			1
this may sound limiting to experienced smartphone users , but it 's probably a good enough starting point for most beginning @entity2 users , especially if you just got your first - ever phone that goes beyond what a basic feature phone or messaging phone can do			2
as a @entity15 news release notes : " according to the @entity52 , more than one third of @entity51 adults own smartphones , but three out of four of those owners do n't use many of the smartphone 's features			1
it 's not because they do n't want apps that are cool or make their lives easier ; it 's because finding the right content is simply too confusing , time consuming or even intimidating			2
" @entity64 is reporting that @entity15 is also rolling out the @entity17 service for higher - end @entity2 devices -- specifically the @entity65 and the forthcoming @entity68 tablet			1
it probably would have to come up with far more sophisticated packages to make this service compelling to users of those devices			2
we 'll see what emerges on this front			0
the @entity17 concept is intriguing			2
basically , it 's selling " skins " for @entity2 devices			0
in this case , the purpose is to ease the less - experienced user 's setup process and overall experience			1
but skins for @entity2 devices can serve many purposes for all kinds of users			2
and the more the device can do , the greater the opportunities for creating compelling skins that integrate a wide range of content and functions			2
@entity15 views @entity17 not just as a service for the packs it decides to offer , but a platform through which others can create and offer their own custom @entity2 skins			1
these could be sold or given away either to the general public or a select group of users , such as fans of a particular band or team , or employees of a large company			0
the october 12 episode of " the cell phone junkie unlocked " podcast included an interview at @entity112 with a @entity15 representative who explained that the @entity17 platform basically allows developers to create custom collections of applications , widgets and other tools to serve specific user groups			1
for instance , many large companies already provide smartphones for their employees			0
the it or telecom department of a large company like @entity127 or @entity128 might use @entity17 to deploy an @entity2 skin for its employees that would include access to in - house proprietary tools or information			2
employees could activate the job - related skin during the workday , then switch to a personal skin ( or no skin ) when off - duty			0
this week 's @entity140 included several sessions that focus on @entity17 , so expect to see the list of available public and proprietary @entity17 packs expanding significantly in coming months			1
@entity15 has n't yet specified how it will choose those it will allow to create @entity17 packs			1
i doubt this carrier 's platform would be wide open to any developer for any purpose , like the @entity152			0
also , @entity17 packs are , of course , available only to @entity15 customers , but @entity2 devices are now available on every carrier			1
maybe alternative @entity2 skin platforms might arise , and they might be open , rather than tied to specific wireless carriers			0
android @entity159 speculated that this strategy may " spell doom " for phone manufacturers ' custom @entity2 user interfaces like @entity164 or @entity165			0
what if you could get an @entity2 skin for the city where you live , or for particular news venues , or organizations that you support ? why not an @entity2 skin for @entity174 residents , or @entity176 republicans , or stock traders , or people who track bills in @entity180 , or the @entity181 , or the @entity182 , or @entity183 ? right now , there are smartphone apps to serve these communities -- but apps are n't everything			0
a custom skin could allow you to integrate mobile web bookmarks , widgets , messaging services , ticker - style updates and more in one experience that you could turn on and off at will on your phone			0
it 'll be interesting to see how this concept develops and spreads .			0
