@entity0 -- the nation 's top military man warned monday of a potentially dangerous gulf between the civilian world and men and women in uniform			0
@entity10 chairman adm. @entity9 said most @entity11 know " precious little " about the military			1
" to the degree we are out of touch i believe it is a very dangerous force , " @entity9 said in a speech to a conference on military professionalism at the @entity16 in @entity0			1
the disconnect between the civilian and military worlds is partially because only a fraction of the population serves and those in uniform increasingly hail from fewer , primarily rural , areas of the country , @entity9 said			1
" our audience , our underpinnings , our authority , everything we are , everything we do , comes from the @entity11 people , " @entity9 said			1
" fundamentally i believe that			0
everything we do , and we can not afford to be out of touch with them			2
" fewer @entity11 have personal contact with members of the military , he said			1
" they know that we are in two wars , we 've sacrificed a lot , lost a lot of people , over 5,500 people			2
they are very supportive of that , " @entity9 said			2
" they care a lot about great young men and women that they know			0
many of them do n't know that many , and it just speaks to the disconnect			0
" the comments echo that of defense secretary @entity60 who , in a september speech , told a college audience the volunteer forces carry an unfair burden in fighting the protracted wars in @entity66 and @entity67			0
" whatever their fond sentiments for men and women in uniform , for most @entity11 the wars remain an abstraction , a distant and unpleasant series of news items that do not affect them personally , " @entity60 said at @entity68			1
" even 9/11 , in the absence of a draft , for a growing number of @entity11 , service in the military , no matter how laudable , has become something for other people to do			1
" @entity9 was one of the movers behind the day - long conference at the @entity16			0
he used the span of his own career to show how public support for the military had risen dramatically from the lows of the @entity94 era			0
" @entity11 people are extraordinarily supportive of our men and women ... there is a sea of good will , " he said			2
the military must work to build and sustain trust or risk negative consequences , he said			0
@entity9 predicted , '' we will find out that , yes we are less than 1 % and we are living in fewer and fewer places and we do n't know the @entity11 people and the @entity11 people do n't know us			1

fewer people serve from fewer parts of the country , @entity9 says
wars remain an abstraction for most @entity11 , he says
" we can not afford to be out of touch with them "
