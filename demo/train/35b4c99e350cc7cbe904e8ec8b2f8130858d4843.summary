-- a small boy , perched on an open catwalk in a candy factory , falls to his death			0
no , it is not a macabre moment out of " @entity7			0
" it is a true story told by social reformer @entity9 , who founded @entity12 's @entity11 in 1889			2
@entity9 also described little girls who refused sweets as @entity16 gifts that year			0
" they could not bear the sight of it , " @entity9 wrote			0
" we discovered that that they had worked from 7 in the morning until 9 at night , and they were exhausted			0
" these dickensian scenes lasted in @entity24 from the late 19th century until 1938 , when child labor was outlawed under the @entity26			1
they are a sobering reminder of why the nation marks @entity30			1
to most @entity24 , the first monday in september means a three - day weekend and the last hurrah of summer , a final outing at the shore before school begins , a family picnic			1
but @entity30 was born in a time when work was no picnic			1
as @entity24 was moving from farms to factories in the @entity41 , there was a long , violent , often - deadly struggle for fundamental workers ' rights , a struggle that in many ways was @entity24 's " other civil war			1
" it was a war fought when 12 - hour days and six - day weeks were routine			1
wages were low ; there were no sick days , pensions or holidays			1
there was certainly no unemployment insurance			0
any attempts at organizing were met by the combined wrath of business and government			0
the business of @entity24 was business			0
that conflict , a period in which thousands of workers died in @entity24 's unsafe and unsanitary factories and mines , and hundreds more died in riots and pitched battles over workers ' rights , is the little - noted history behind this holiday			1
the first @entity24 @entity30 is dated to a parade organized by unions in @entity73 on september 5 , 1882 , as a celebration of " the strength and spirit of the @entity24 worker			1
" their goals were simple : decent wages , an eight - hour workday and the right to organize			1
the september date was selected to provide a respite for workers and their families midway between july @entity87 and @entity88			2
by all accounts , the first @entity30 was a peaceful affair that drew tens of thousands of workers and their families to the city 's @entity91			1
but the path to a national @entity30 holiday was no walk in the park			1
the federal @entity30 was created 12 years later , signed into law by president @entity98 during his second term in 1894			1
it 's not that @entity101 was a great friend of labor			1
in fact , he had just sent out troops to break a strike			2
during the economic depression known as the @entity114 , workers for the @entity109 , one of the country 's largest manufacturers , walked off their jobs when @entity116 tried to cut wages , fire workers and evict them from their company - owned homes			1
they were joined by hundreds of thousands of workers in a nationwide walkout			2
facing a strike that would shut down @entity24 's railroads , @entity101 dispatched 12,000 federal troops on the premise that the strike interfered with the @entity128			2
in the ensuing violence , at least 13 strikers were killed			0
this was not the first time troops had been used against @entity24 workers			0
federal soldiers , state militias and private armies , often from the @entity137 , had used deadly force to break many 19th - century strikes			1
some of these strikes had become pitched battles , like the @entity143 strike of 1892 in @entity144			0
there , men on both sides armed with rifles and cannons died fighting over keeping a union at a steel mill , a union that owner @entity152 and manager @entity153 were determined to break			0
after crushing the @entity116 strike , @entity101 thought that granting workers a @entity30 holiday was a sop that would appease them as he sought a third term			1
( it did n't work ; he was denied the @entity162 nomination in 1896			0
) politicians and labor leaders were content to keep the holiday in september , far from the growing popularity of @entity167 as a commemoration of the " martyrs of @entity170 , " a group of union leaders executed -- unjustly , it was later proved -- after @entity12 's deadly @entity170 in may 1884			1
for unions , @entity30 proved a hollow victory			1
most of the reforms they sought did not come about for nearly half a century			0
the depression - era fair labor laws that were passed under @entity178 finally set standards like the eight - hour day and an end to child labor			1
this history is worth remembering on @entity30			1
but at a moment when @entity24 workers are battered by high unemployment , the @entity187 , a technology revolution in the workplace and globalization , there seems to be little to celebrate			0
and these economic forces are only part of the relentless pressures faced by @entity24 's work force			2
there is also a renewed war over labor in this country			2
it is being fought in battleground states including , most notably , @entity202 , @entity201 , @entity203 and @entity204 , where mostly @entity206 governors are wrangling with public employees over pay , pensions and more fundamental issues including the right of collective bargaining			0
their sharp anti-union rhetoric has increasingly found receptive listeners who have been convinced that " spoiled " unions and public employees -- the people who fight our fires , teach our children and pick up our garbage -- are at fault for our budgetary woes and the sorry state of the economy			0
the fight has been vitriolic but well short of the violence of @entity24 's " other civil war			2
" with that in mind , it is worth recalling president @entity233 's words during the dark early days of the real @entity234			2
" capital is only the fruit of labor , and could never have existed if labor had not first existed , " he told @entity236 in december 1861			0
" @entity241 is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration , " today , the first @entity206 president 's words would count as heresy in the @entity206			2
but they are a sharp reminder that working men and women built this country and fought its wars			0
and their labors are worth more than a monday holiday or the mean - spirited contempt they now face			0
they deserve , as @entity233 said , " the higher consideration			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			0

@entity263 : today , labor under fire . but war for workers ' rights was long , deadly struggle
there was child labor , 12 - hour days , 6 - day weeks , low wages , no sick days , holidays
soldiers , militias , private armies used deadly force to break 19th - century strikes
@entity30 born in 1894 , he says , but reform did n't come till @entity178 's fair labor laws
