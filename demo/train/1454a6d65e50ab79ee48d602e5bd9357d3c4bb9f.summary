@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 has traded " @entity4 " for @entity3			1
the loquacious @entity8 @entity7 , with a penchant for memorable speeches , criticized president @entity10 's executive orders on immigration thursday by adapting an address from the orator @entity3 , warning of the demise of the @entity16			1
" the words of @entity3 , powerfully relevant 2077 years later , " the conservative said on the @entity19 floor			1
" when president @entity10 do you mean to cease abusing our patience			1
how long is that madness of yours still to mock us			0
when is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours , swaggering about as it does now , " @entity2 intoned			2
" what shall we who are the @entity19 tolerate , president @entity10 openly desirous to destroy the @entity34 and this republic ? " he added			1
a @entity2 spokeswoman explained the events @entity3 warned of two millennia ago -- when the aristocrat @entity39 , a champion of the poor , was attempting a coup -- apply to the current dispute over whether the president has the right to change immigration laws without the consent of @entity47			2
she said the speech , which ran about four minutes , is " almost verbatim " to how @entity3 delivered it			2
" it is incredible how accurately this narrative applies to today , " @entity50 said			0
" the president once said he could not take such action on immigration because he was not an emperor , yet today he is acting just as such			0
" " for we have a resolution of the @entity19 , a formidable and authoritative decree against you , mr. president			2
the wisdom of the republic is not at fault , nor the dignity of this senatorial body , " @entity2 said			0
" we alone , i say it openly , we the @entity19 are waiting in our duty to stop this lawless administration and its unconstitutional amnesty			0
" the historically themed speech clearly won points for creativity			0
but it might not have been surprising coming from the @entity76 and @entity77 trained lawyer			0
his most memorable words from the floor prior to this were when , during a lengthy filibuster - type speech related to president 's health care reform law , he read dr. @entity88 's " @entity4 " as bedtime story for his children watching on @entity87 .			1
