these are just a few of the themes that have bubbled to the surface since @entity6 ended thursday and the roundups started pouring in			1
like most of us living outside the bubble , i relied on fashion magazines , blogs , phlogs , @entity14 and tweets to stay abreast of the action			0
here 's a sampling of what i 've gleaned			2
starting from the end of the week - long event , @entity19 brings us a video love letter via @entity23 of dancing models and @entity6 attendees			1
it 's a good point of entry into the asymmetric shapes , colors and silhouettes swirling around the various @entity6 venues the past week			1
as for a roundup of roundups , @entity31 breaks down the major style trends and designers to dominate the runways , from pastels and prints to modern grunge meets sportswear			1
@entity41 tackles the same theme with more pretty images			0
then there are the looks that are so bizarre they ca n't be replicated off the runways , perhaps with the exception of wet mullets			1
otherwise , @entity49 has the rest of them in its list of runway trends you should not try at home			1
for a quick day - to - day look , go to @entity58 's " @entity59 " series and catch up on the looks and the gossip encircling the shows			1
rounding out the random top 10 lists : best nail art. for the sartorially minded male with a lot of time on his hands , @entity65 has a 72 - image slideshow of best pieces from the shows , as chosen by editors of its @entity72			2
there 's also an abbreviated list of stuff they 're coveting now , like neon suits , wedges and varsity jackets			1
speaking of men 's style , we published this in - depth story on how sites like @entity86 and @entity87 and @entity88 are banking on the stereotype that men do n't like to shop in stores to draw an audience for full - priced luxury brands			2
oftentimes , the parade of attendees outside the shows are just as visually stimulating as the ones on the runway			2
images from @entity101 's street style series and @entity103 's spotlight on fashion week could easily be mistaken for a fashion shoot , although it helps that everyone 's so attractive			2
for a culinary twist on the action outside the shows , makeup artist @entity107 teamed up with comedian @entity110 to document visits to their favorite restaurants on her @entity113			0
since it 's fashion week , they dress for the occasion			0
no fashion week coverage would be complete without putting the spotlight on one of the most famous names in fashion			0
@entity122 sat down with @entity0 's @entity123 to talk about being the creative director of @entity125 and the possibility of working for @entity127			0
for more on the mainstream tip , @entity0 looks at @entity129 as @entity131 's iconic fashion label and how it 's making a comeback			0
that 's it for now			0
next up : @entity134 !			0
