-- potato salad is a cause worthy of charitable donations			1
that notion started out as a joke in early july , when @entity6 opened a @entity8 campaign requesting $ 10 in crowdfunding to make his very first batch of it			1
but the joke was on him , when an @entity13 mob pounded him with a sum far beyond his goal -- $ 55,492			1
on saturday , he spent it on a public party in a city park in his hometown of @entity20 , @entity21 , to benefit charity			0
he says he wo n't personally pocket any of the loot			0
the @entity13 storm also whisked @entity6 into an overnight sensation			1
the raging speed of donations snagged the attention of " @entity29 " in a few days ' time			0
the newly minted fund - raiser popped by @entity32 's morning show studio in shorts and sneakers with no socks , and showed off a cheap t - shirt with homemade iron - on lettering that read , in all caps : " i just @entity40			0
" too much money his campaign 's dizzying momentum blindsided @entity6			1
" at @entity46 , we had $ 200			1
i thought that was way too much money , " he told the show			0
he confessed that he had not yet made any potato salad but said he 'd received many recipes through the @entity13 -- from mayo - daubed to vinegar - splashed concoctions			1
@entity6 's bewilderment over the sum did n't stop him from handily hoisting the fund - raising bar much higher			2
he pledged prizes for various levels of donation : a bite of the potato salad for those contributing $ 3			1
a hat for a contribution of $ 25			0
a t - shirt for $ 35			0
he added " stretch " goals for donors to meet between $ 35 and $ 3,000			0
while the money came in streams , visitors to his @entity8 page arrived in deluges , tallying more than 4 million views			2
it ranks no. 4 on the website for all - time visits , according to @entity8			2
potato salad weighs in ahead of actor @entity81 's @entity80 , which ranks eighth , and the @entity83 virtual reality headset , which ranks 10th			1
nevertheless , donations to those campaigns rocketed into lofty millions and dwarf the money given to potato salad			1
eating up attention @entity6 has reveled in the attention , posting @entity90 videos satirizing his cause with an indelible bright - eyed gaze and an upbeat smile on his cleanshaven face			2
he took the @entity96 ice bucket challenge by pouring a bucket of potatoes over his head before someone else doused him with ice water			0
consistently , @entity6 thanked the internet for its charity , personifying and addressing it personally by introducing videos with the salutation , " hello , @entity13			1
" two and a half months after uploading his joke campaign , @entity6 was sitting on sacks of potatoes and money			1
he had promised to read off the list of his donors on camera while he made his first potato salad			1
it took him nearly four hours to read all the names of generous people from 20 - some countries -- 6,911 people donated in all			0
feeding those in need then it came time to do something with all those spuds and all that dough			0
" i want to do the most good that i can do with this , " he had told " @entity29			0
" but @entity8 prevents campaigners from turning their cash directly over to charities			2
to get around that , @entity6 splurged for a concert bash called @entity133 2014 with concession stands and sponsorships , he said on his website , thepotatostock.com			1
proceeds from the event went to nonprofits to fight hunger in @entity21			0
@entity6 invited the entire internet to the party , and a few people did drive to @entity20 from other states , according to @entity6 's @entity146 posts			2
but for all the global attention , a big chunk of the funding came from close to home			0
about 90 % came from the @entity151 , and donors from @entity21 gave the most money , followed by @entity154			0
nearly 63 % of the @entity21 donations were contributed from in and around @entity20 , the very area @entity6 intends to feed			2

@entity6 asked on @entity8 for $ 10 to make his first batch of potato salad
on the first day , he got $ 200 -- way too much , he thought
he ended up with more than $ 55,000 and *decided* to use it for a charity bash
the campaign has made @entity6 an overnight sensation
