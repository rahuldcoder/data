-- last tuesday @entity1 unveiled its attempt to rival @entity3 , a social - networking product called @entity5			1
i received an invitation from a friend and have been putting this nascent service through its paces -- especially on my @entity12 phone			1
here 's my experience so far : ( do you want a @entity5 invitation ? sorry , you may have to wait			2
) first , a caveat : absolutely everything about @entity5 , including its mobile experience , is in a state of flux			2
so at least some of what i write here will definitely change in the coming days and weeks			0
@entity5 is very much a " beta " service , sporting plenty of glitches , mysteries and oddities			1
therefore it 's just as well that the vast majority of people using it so far seem to be serious social media geeks			0
yes , that does make for a lot of redundant , tiresome conversations probing the arcane nuances of @entity5 and comparing it to @entity3 , @entity38 and @entity39			2
but it 's probably best to let the geeks kick the tires on @entity5 first			2
later on , when the service becomes more widely available , less - geeky users will definitely benefit from this process			0
so be a little patient			0
there are main components to the @entity5 mobile experience are the free @entity12 app ( of course ) , and the mobile web app ( accessible via the mobile browser on most web - enabled phones )			1
to get @entity12 app working you must first install the app , then log into @entity5 via the @entity58 to set up a link to your phone			1
then you should be able to use the app. @entity61 app video explains how the app is supposed to work , after you 've done this setup			0
i was able to easily install the @entity5 app and link my account to my first - generation @entity68			1
so far this app is running fine for me -- no freezes or crashes			0
however , i 've noticed some other @entity5 mobile users have complained of problems : the app installed slowly or not at all , or it crashed , or they 're having problems getting their phone linked to their @entity5 account			1
given the vast diversity of @entity12 devices , versions of the @entity12 operating system running on them , and manufacturer - specific interfaces ( like @entity86 ) , this is n't surprising			0
but for now , @entity12 users have the best shot of enjoying a satisfactory mobile @entity5 experience			1
that 's because , so far there are no @entity5 native smartphone apps for platforms other than @entity12			1
@entity1 says the @entity95 app is coming soon , and others are probably in the works			0
@entity5 users on @entity101 phones -- or who ca n't or do n't want to install the app -- currently can use the mobile web app. here , functionality varies : @entity12 and @entity95 users of the web app enjoy substantially more functionality than people on @entity109 , @entity110 , or webos devices , at least so far			1
the @entity12 app is really important , since @entity113 rightly observes : " the success of @entity5 will partly depend on the quality of the user experience the service offers on mobile devices			1
because @entity1 is n't just a web developer but also major mobile platform vendor through @entity12 , the company has an opportunity to offer deep integration between its new social networking service and the popular smartphone operating system			2
" what i like mostly , i like the @entity12 app. i am able to use all the other core functionality of @entity5 via the @entity12 app without difficulty			1
for instance , i can add people to my " circles " ( contact groups that i define ) , read my " stream " ( the @entity5 equivalent of a @entity3 news feed , or a tweetstream ) , and take and upload photos			2
so generally , i 'm pretty satisfied with the app. if you 're uploading mobile photos or video to @entity5 ( and you can only do this via the @entity12 app so far , which puts @entity95 shutterbugs out of luck ) , you might want to peruse your instant upload settings			1
by default , @entity5 uploads everything you shoot as soon as you shoot it , to a private album , from which you can selectively share photos			0
personally i only want to upload images i wish to share , so i 've turned this option off			0
having the @entity5 app installed on my phone offers one key advantage over the computer - based browser experience of @entity5 : sharing links			1
with the app installed and activated on my @entity12 phone , now when i 'm using any of the web browser i have installed on my phone ( even @entity164 ) , when i find a page i want to share , @entity5 is listed as one of the many " share page " options ( along with @entity169 , @entity170 , messages , etc. ) this is actually easier than sharing links to @entity5 on my computer			1
so far as i 've been able to find there 's no @entity5 bookmarklet or browser toolbar button that 's the equivalent of share on @entity3			1
i use these kinds of tools all the time for other services in my web browser			0
i 'm sure @entity5 will have one eventually , but right now on my @entity12 phone at least i do n't have to cut - and - paste the link			1
i 'll like it even better when @entity1 releases an application programming interface for @entity5 , so other services i like and use frequently , such as @entity186 , for posting photos selectively to several services at once , can connect to my @entity5 presence			2
what 's not working one of the main glitches i 've noticed with mobile @entity5 involves the " huddle " feature -- a prominent part app , featured on its home screen			1
as far as i understand it , a " huddle " is supposed to be the @entity5 alternative to group texting services			0
it allows self - defined groups of mobile users to convene on - the - fly private discussions -- such friends deciding where to meet at the beach , or journalists in the field coordinating coverage of a breaking news event			0
i was able to use the @entity12 app to initiate a huddle and invite several friends			2
however , the only person who could actually join the huddle was also using the @entity12 app. all other invitees , who were accessing @entity5 via a their web browser ( desktop or mobile ) , would click to accept my invitation -- but then they were inexplicably routed to the main @entity1 mobile info page			1
theoretically , @entity5 users should be able to participate in a huddle via the mobile web ( although that did n't work for my friends ) , and even non-users should be able to participate via sms , though that seems sketchy			2
i searched @entity228 for huddle info -- but as of this writing the only result that yields is how to delete your account			0
since @entity233 is strictly a mobile service , info about it can be found in @entity236			0
this is n't exactly intuitive from the user 's perspective , and i hope @entity1 fixes that soon			2
help should always be where users expect to find it			0
despite how @entity1 has organized this project , users do n't perceive the @entity12 app as a separate service from @entity5			1
another glitch : i noticed that my mobile notifications usually lag			0
i just accessed @entity5 on my laptops web browser and saw five new notifications of interaction from other users , similar to @entity3 notifications			2
but i 'm not seeing these on my @entity12 app. that 's been happening a lot			2
like i said : @entity5 is really , really beta			0
but so far it 's sufficiently functional , interesting , and engaging for me to want to keep using it			0
even better , in my opinion the @entity5 user interface -- standard and mobile -- is cleaner , more intuitive , more attractive , more user friendly , and less potentially misleading than @entity3 's			1
plus , it offers huge potential to connect with all the other @entity1 services i 'm already using : @entity1 calendar , @entity170 , @entity1 docs , and more			0
will @entity5 catch on ? influential tech blogger @entity266 doubts that @entity5 stands much chance of getting adopted by the average @entity3 user , and instead will only appeal to the geekier types initially invited			1
he thinks that would be just great , by the way			0
i disagree -- and mobile is a big part of why i disagree			0
consider this combination of factors : the opportunity to deeply , even inherently , integrate @entity5 with @entity12 @entity1 's existing array of hugely popular consumer services ( mail , docs , calendar , etc. ) @entity5 does n't think too far outside the box -- which was the downfall of @entity283			1
it emulates the best functionality from existing popular social media services , but offers in many ways , i think a more user - friendly experience			0
mobile devices are fast becoming the most common way that people access the @entity291 , worldwide and in the @entity292 at least 200 million people already have @entity1 accounts , based on estimates of active @entity170 users -- but the total number of @entity1 account holders is probably much higher so : what would happen if @entity1 suddenly made @entity5 available to all @entity1 account holders and @entity12 device users ? i 'll bet the folks at @entity3 are pretty worried about exactly that possibility right now			1
and it sounds like maybe they are ... the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity307 .			0
