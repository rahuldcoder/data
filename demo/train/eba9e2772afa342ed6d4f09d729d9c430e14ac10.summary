a young woman leaves her farming village at age 16 to find work in a distant city			2
with three younger children at home , her parents ca n't afford to keep her in school			0
her first job , on a factory assembly line , pays only $ 50 a month			2
over two years she takes night - school classes , gets a series of secretarial jobs , and lands a coveted position in a factory 's purchasing department that pays more than $ 1,000 a month			1
she meets a young man , a fellow migrant ; they marry and have two children			0
the couple saves enough money to buy an apartment for her parents and a secondhand @entity24 for themselves			0
then the young woman leaves her daughters in the temporary care of her husband and his parents , so she can return to the city to work again			2
" a person should have some ambition while she is young , " she writes , " so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose			2
" watch @entity40 's @entity39 the outlines of this young woman 's story are familiar ; she could be one of the millions of immigrants who crossed an ocean to make a new life in @entity48			1
we acknowledge that their lives were hard , but we believe that with adversity came opportunity and transformation			2
but if i tell you that this woman 's name is @entity60 , and that she lives in @entity61 , all such possibility seems to fall away			1
she is recast as a victim of the world 's largest authoritarian regime , where workers earn less than a dollar an hour and independent unions are against the law			0
her story becomes one of misery and exploitation			0
how could it be otherwise ? i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers in the south @entity61 factory city of @entity77			1
these young men and women labored long hours every day , sometimes for weeks on end without a break ; the best factories gave one day off each week			0
a government - mandated 11 - hour workday was routinely ignored , and factories frequently paid less than the minimum wage or withheld pay for minor infractions			0
injuries on the factory floor resulted from safety violations and minimal employee training			0
workers might sleep 10 or 15 to a room , with 50 people sharing one bathroom			1
@entity39 : behind the great firewall of @entity61 yet these workers did not strike me as cowed ; despite their youth and inexperience , they were capable and resourceful at improving their situations over time			1
almost every worker i met told me a story of challenging her boss over some injustice , which frequently led her superiors to take notice and treat her better			0
the workers figured out who were the best employers , took private classes to learn computer or secretarial skills and talked their way into higher - paying jobs			2
they became the chief earners in their families and challenged long - held traditions			0
they urged their parents to keep younger siblings in school ; they resisted pressure to marry early and return to a way of life they no longer wanted			0
for these young women , the factory experience could not be boiled down to a set of working conditions			2
it also changed their lives			0
surveys have shown that @entity61 migrants are younger and better educated than the people who stay behind in the village , and that they choose to leave home as much to see the world and to develop new skills as to earn money			1
factory work is an informed choice , not a desperate response to poverty			2
other studies by @entity61 and @entity147 scholars show that migration fuels economic growth , social mobility and the spread of progressive ideas			1
income from migrant work is the biggest source of wealth accumulation in rural @entity61			1
@entity39 : the generation that 's remaking @entity61 by 2025 , @entity158 has estimated , the @entity61 middle class will swell to 520 million people , most of them former migrants who have done well in the cities and stayed			1
one study has shown that having done migrant work makes a rural woman more likely to choose her own husband , to give birth in a hospital , and to seek equality in marriage			0
it 's possible to acknowledge that the @entity61 factory regime has immense problems but that it also brings benefits to individuals within that system			1
perhaps @entity61 workers deserve our interest and respect instead of our pity			1
just to say these things makes some people angry			0
since my @entity39 talk on @entity61 factory workers was posted online , i have been accused of working in league with the technology industry to perpetuate the enslavement of @entity61 workers			1
" you sicken me with your effort to discount the negatives of factory workers in @entity61 by making it sound like the workers want this , " one person wrote			1
what accounts for such visceral reactions ? one answer lies in the nature of daily journalism			0
by focusing on extreme events , such as a violent brawl earlier this week at a @entity204 plant that manufactures for @entity205 , journalists create the impression of an enormous underclass on the edge of revolt			0
@entity39 : does democracy stifle economic growth ? write about ordinary workers who have not endured violent protests or extraordinary suffering , and you may be attacked for hiding the truth or shilling for the corporations			0
a widespread fear of @entity61 — a monolithic force that is taking over the world and stealing @entity48 jobs — blinds people to the complexities of life there			1
the @entity61 government is not a democracy , yet its economic policies over the past three decades have improved the lives of millions			2
but it 's far easier to believe that everyone there is exploited and miserable			0
it 's true that @entity61 factories have harsh conditions			1
it 's also true that @entity61 factories have allowed huge numbers of people to improve their lives and change their fates			1
this same set of contradictory facts characterized @entity48 's industrialization more than a hundred years ago			1
to insist on seeing @entity61 in black and white reflects an ignorance of history and a failure of the imagination			2
follow @ @entity252 on twitter			0

@entity40 : conditions are harsh , but people ignore the full stories of @entity61 workers
she says factory jobs have provided upward mobility , new opportunity in @entity61
people look back *admiringly* at heroic work of immigrants to @entity48 100 years ago , she says
chang : @entity61 workers deserve our interest and respect instead of our pity
