@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was ahead of his time			1
and today , more than 30 years after the @entity6 - born math teacher put @entity8 ' @entity7 on the map by convening 14 students in his very first @entity12 calculus class , the rest of the educational establishment is still trying to catch up			1
@entity3 -- who was immortalized in the 1988 film " @entity16 " -- died this week at his son 's home in @entity19 , @entity1 , after a bout with cancer			1
it was way back in 1978 when @entity3 began teaching calculus to @entity26 - @entity25 kids from the barrio			1
that 's more than two decades before president @entity29 challenged the nation 's public schools to acknowledge and overcome the " soft bigotry of low expectations , " and @entity3 was already fighting that battle			1
he knew all about low expectations -- most of them coming from jealous colleagues and visionless administrators			2
more important , @entity3 knew the recipe for how to overcome those low expectations and teach students to succeed			1
it starts , he would say , with " ganas " -- the desire of students to learn , coupled with the desire of teachers to teach			2
mix in two parts hard work , a cup of sacrifice , and a dash of " anything is possible			0
" oh , because you 'll inevitability meet up with cynics and critics who try to derail you , to make themselves feel better about their own failings and to sustain their prejudices about who can learn and who ca n't , it does n't hurt to put in a spoonful of attitude of the sort embodied in @entity64 's quip : " it does n't matter what the morons say			1
" all across the @entity25 , students and teachers come to the classroom with tons of built - in excuses of why they ca n't or wo n't do what they know they need to do			1
and so , it 's no wonder so little gets done			2
just as it 's no wonder that those who try to break through that culture and actually teach students who have been written off often meet with resistance			2
one of the things i remember from the years i spent teaching the children of @entity26 farm workers in central @entity1 was that sometimes , it seems , students and teachers are competing to see which group is the most victimized			2
@entity3 had no interest in that game			2
personally , i think it was because he was an immigrant			0
here you have someone who arrived in the @entity25 with very little money , who was n't able to speak the language , but went on to mop floors and work as a short - order cook by day			1
he learned @entity100 and earned math degrees , and a teaching credential by night , on his way to working for an electronics company			0
then he followed his passion into teaching			0
you know people like that , or you did			0
take out " @entity6 " and fill in " @entity112 " or " @entity113			0
" those people do n't want to hear your problems and why you think you ca n't do something			0
you whine about how hard you have it and how the odds are against you , and they just arrived from a place that makes your troubles look like a day at the beach			0
that 's how it was for the man who was eulogized this week by @entity128 , education reporter for the @entity129 , as " the most famous and influential @entity25 public school teacher of his generation			1
" @entity3 had no interest in hearing why poor @entity26 - @entity25 kids from a barrio high school could n't learn calculus , ace a national test and go on to attend prestigious universities			1
he was too busy making it happen			0
i met @entity3 once in the late 1980 's at a black - tie affair in @entity142			1
but , the more memorable encounter took place a couple of years earlier , while i was in college			0
i had placed a long distance call to @entity7 and left a message			0
a student group on campus wanted him to speak			0
to my surprise , after seeing a message that the school receptionist had scribbled down as being from simply " @entity153 at @entity154 , " he called me back			0
to my amusement , i soon realized the reason he did was because he thought i was another @entity153 at @entity154 -- a former student			0
for a lot of public school teachers in @entity25 , especially those who teach socio - economically disadvantaged kids , that kind of call might be unusual			1
his former students from @entity164 were sprinkled all over the @entity165 -- not just at @entity154 , but also at @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and other universities			0
i 'd sometimes meet them at student conferences , and there was always something special about them and how they carried themselves			0
there was that badge of honor , that additional bit of confidence that came from being one of an elite group of high achievers who demolished the low expectations of others			2
these were @entity3 's kids			1
that 's an impressive legacy -- and , in the case of an extraordinary educator who still teaches us what 's possible in our public schools when you ditch the excuses , and have the ganas to make it happen , a well - deserved one			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202			2

@entity25 's schools still have a lot to learn from @entity3 , who died this week
@entity202 says the celebrated teacher did n't expect low achievement from poor , minority students
he says that by aiming high , @entity3 got extraordinary *results* from students
