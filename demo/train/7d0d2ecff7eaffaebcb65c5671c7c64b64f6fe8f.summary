-- skeletal remains found in the chimney of an @entity4 , @entity5 , bank two months ago have been identified as those of a local man who had n't been seen in 27 years			1
the remains are those of @entity10 , who vanished at age 22 in january 1984 , @entity4 police lt. @entity8 told @entity0			1
@entity10 's disappearance was noted after he failed to show up for a court hearing on a charge of possession of a stolen vehicle			1
when officers showed up at his home to take him in to custody , @entity10 's mother said he had fled to avoid arrest			0
the remains were discovered in may when construction workers were doing renovations on the main branch of the @entity26 , a historic building that sits on the main square in the southwestern @entity5 town of 25,000 people			1
tests done at a @entity33 forensics lab established the remains were those of @entity10			2
the cause of death was likely dehydration and starvation , @entity8 said			0
foul play was not suspected and the case is closed , he said			0
but why @entity10 was in the chimney remains a bit of a mystery			1
@entity8 told reporters that @entity10 had gloves and a cigarette lighter on him , but no bag or anything to indicate he planned to carry loot from the bank			2
even if @entity10 had planned a burglary , the chimney would not have gotten him into the bank			2
@entity8 said the fireplace that the chimney vented had no large opening at the bottom from which he could have emerged			0
how could the remains have gone unnoticed for 27 years ? one , @entity10 had a history of running away , once even joining a traveling circus , @entity8 said , so even his family was not actively looking for him			0
two , the chimney opens on to the second floor of the red - brick bank building in @entity4 , @entity8 said , and for decades the second floor had been used mainly for storage			1
@entity10 's family is not commenting on the case , @entity8 said			0

@entity10 vanished at age 22 , when he was facing a stolen vehicle charge
the remains were discovered in may by workers doing renovation on the bank building
the chimney was too *small* at the bottom for him to gain entry into the building , police say
