this week , we mark the tenth anniversary of the day the @entity2 launched the @entity3			2
but when we think of how differently that war might have been fought , the most important date to remember is february 25 , 2003			0
that 's when @entity8 chief of staff @entity7 told the @entity9 that " several hundred thousand soldiers " would be needed in @entity10 when post-hostilities control was taken into consideration			1
@entity7 's estimate was more than double that of the @entity16 administration , which in march 2003 sent a ground invasion force of 145,000 troops into @entity10			1
@entity20 's @entity19 wasted no time in answering @entity7			0
two days after @entity7 's @entity9 testimony , deputy secretary of defense @entity21 used his appearance before the @entity24 to present an entirely different view of @entity2 's prospects in @entity10			1
" some of the higher - end predictions that we have been hearing recently , such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand @entity2 troops to provide stability in @entity32 ( @entity33 ) @entity10 , are wildly off the mark , " @entity21 declared			1
" it is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in a @entity10 than it would take to conduct the war itself			0
" the @entity19 's anger with @entity7 was understandable			0
his troop estimate made it seem as if the @entity16 administration was lowballing @entity46 and the @entity2 public			1
but there was nothing out of the ordinary in @entity7 's thinking			0
in @entity52 , where @entity7 had served with the @entity2 peacekeeping mission after the ethnic warfare there was stopped , the @entity19 had used a formula of one soldier for every 50 @entity52			1
in @entity10 that calculation added up to 300,000 troops			0
the @entity19 countered @entity7 by saying that @entity10 was very different from @entity52 when it came to troop needs			2
" there has been none of the record in @entity10 of ethnic militias fighting one another that produced so much bloodshed and permanent scars in @entity52 , along with a continuing requirement for large peacekeeping forces to separate those militias , " @entity21 insisted			0
by april 2003 , one month after the @entity10 invasion began , it became clear that @entity7 's troop estimate was correct			1
when mobs began looting government buildings and hospitals , there were not enough @entity2 soldiers to stop them			0
" stuff happens ! " was @entity20 's explanation of the chaos			0
a more publicity conscious @entity8 chief of staff than @entity7 might have used the looting to make his case before the media			0
long before their disagreement over @entity10 , he and @entity20 had clashed over @entity20 's belief that high - tech warfare gave the @entity19 leeway to reduce overall @entity2 troop strength			2
in 2002 @entity20 , irritated by @entity7 's insistence that @entity2 troops were stretched too thin around the world , had made @entity7 a lame - duck @entity8 chief of staff by announcing his successor while @entity7 had more than a year left to serve			1
in the spring of 2003 @entity7 chose , however , not to engage in a protracted war of words with @entity20			0
instead , he stuck to his position on what was needed in @entity10 and waited until his @entity19 retirement ceremony in june 2003 to make his case that in the wake of 9/11 , @entity2 needed more boots on the ground to meet its global responsibilities			1
" beware the 12 - division strategy for a 10 - division @entity8 , " @entity7 told his @entity19 audience and then went on to compare @entity2 's war in @entity10 with the war he knew as a junior officer in @entity113			1
" the lessons i learned in @entity113 are always with me , " @entity7 stressed , " lessons about loyalty , about taking care of the people who sacrifice the most			0
" both president @entity16 and @entity20 made a point of not attending @entity7 's retirement ceremony , and the @entity122 buried its account of @entity7 's retirement speech on page 32 of the news section			2
by contrast , those who came to @entity7 's retirement ceremony did so as an act of support , and they included not only @entity8 brass who appreciated the stance he had taken on @entity10 but a contingent of his @entity137 classmates , who , like @entity7 , had served in @entity113 during the 1960s			2
in the eyes of many of his classmates , @entity7 , who lost nearly half his right foot after stepping on a @entity113 land mine , was doing for the troops in @entity10 what president @entity145 and his secretary of defense , @entity146 , had failed to do for @entity2 's troops in @entity113 : he was looking out for them regardless of the political consequences			1
to these classmates @entity7 's candor about @entity10 made him as much a hero as his @entity113 combat record , and today , as we look back on @entity10 and try to decide who the best and brightest generals of that war were , @entity7 's 2003 judgment shines through			2
small wonder that , like another admired @entity8 chief of staff , @entity160 hero @entity159 , @entity7 has had a second career as the head of the @entity163 .			1

@entity165 : an @entity2 general took issue with @entity16 administration views on @entity10
@entity7 argued that the @entity2 needed a much larger force to bring stability to @entity10
others who *objected* to his estimate were proved *wrong* , @entity173 says
@entity173 : @entity7 , now @entity163 chief , was penalized for showing loyalty to troops
