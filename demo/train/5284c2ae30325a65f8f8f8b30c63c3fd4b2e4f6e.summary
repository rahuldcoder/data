@entity0 -- the @entity2 , the @entity3 and @entity4 have filed a trade case over @entity7 's export restrictions on rare earth minerals that are crucial for the production of many high - tech devices			1
what are rare earth minerals ? rare earths are 17 minerals with magnetic and conductive properties that are used in most of today 's electronic devices , including flat - screen televisions , smart phones , hybrid cars and weapons			1
the minerals include cerium , neodymium , dysprosium , tungsten and molybdenum			0
@entity27 , for example , is used in electronics , automotive , aerospace and medical technologies			0
@entity7 produces 91 % of the world 's tungsten			2
molybdenum is a metallic element used for filaments in light bulbs			0
@entity7 produces 36 % of the world 's molybdenum			0
they are not actually " rare , " and can be found in other countries -- including the @entity2 -- but they are difficult to mine safely			0
about a third of the world 's rare earth deposits are in @entity7 but the country controls around 97 % of production , in part due to its lower labor costs and less stringent environmental regulations			1
rare earth minerals ' importance and limited supplies have created friction between @entity7 and the @entity2 , among other countries , for years			1
what is the issue ? @entity7 's dominance in the industry has led to suggestions it can be used as part of a trade war with the @entity2 and @entity65			1
in 2010 , a report commissioned by the @entity67 found @entity7 's dominant position in production could have major implications for the @entity2 @entity71			1
in june that year , @entity7 tightened export restrictions on the materials by raising export taxes and reducing the amount it can send overseas			2
it reduced the quota for @entity7 - owned companies by 32 % but by 54 % for companies with foreign investment			0
in december , it further reduced quotas			0
it also temporarily halted shipments of rare earths to @entity4 , prompting a sharp spike in prices of the minerals			1
what has happened now ? the trade case by the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 accuses @entity7 of increasing prices outside @entity7 while lowering them within the country , creating unfair advantages			1
the @entity2 also accuses @entity7 of hoarding the minerals for its own use			2
the @entity2 aims to pressure @entity7 to lift export limits			2
@entity7 has defended its actions by saying they are in line with @entity99 regulations , and that the restrictions are due to environmental concerns			0
why does it matter ? rare earths minerals are hugely important to the technology industry , and the @entity2 and the @entity3 are fierce in their language against @entity7			1
according to a @entity107 statement , restrictions " violate international trade rules " and hurt producers of car components and computers , among other industries			0
the @entity3 said it has raised the issue with @entity7 repeatedly over the past years without success			2
@entity2 president @entity115 said : " we have got to take control of our energy future and we ca n't let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules			0
" what will happen next ? the @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity4 are all making requests for consultations with the @entity7 , as part of the @entity99 dispute process			1
if agreement is not reached within 60 days , the issue can get kicked up to a @entity99 settlement panel			0
whatever the outcome , it could take some time : a similar dispute over restrictions on raw materials was settled this year -- in favor of the @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity138 -- three years after it was launched .			2
