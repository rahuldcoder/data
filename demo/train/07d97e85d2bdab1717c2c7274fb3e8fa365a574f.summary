-- @entity1 could n't get his hotel internet to work for more than an hour on monday night			2
and @entity1 is well aware that he 's not alone in experiencing frustration with hotel internet service			2
the quality of internet service remains the top problem experienced by hotel guests , and it has the biggest impact on customer satisfaction , according to the @entity12 2013 @entity13 released wednesday			1
@entity1 is @entity12 's global travel and hospitality practice lead , and he needed the @entity16 to work on the study			2
" the internet is the modern day hotelier 's biggest challenge without question , " said @entity1			0
" lots of hotels do n't offer good internet connectivity			0
" of the 20 % of guests who had a problem with their hotel stay , nearly one - third reported a problem with the @entity16			1
if a guest experienced problems connecting to the @entity16 -- regardless of whether they were charged separately or it was included in the price of their rooms -- that guest 's hotel satisfaction dropped an average of 133 points			1
despite complaints about the @entity16 or other issues , hotel guests are happier than they 've been in years			1
some 80 % of guests do n't complain at all , the study shows , and hotel guest satisfaction increased to the highest levels in seven years , an average of 777 on a 1,000 - point scale			1
that 's up 20 points from 2012			0
and the top rated airline is ... the study ranks eight hotel categories by seven factors			2
the @entity56 came in first place among luxury brands , while @entity59 ranked highest in the " upper upscale " category			0

airports where the architecture soars focus on the personal touch a hotel 's personal touch also counts , said @entity1			0
guests who interact with four or more different types of staff ( excluding check - in ) report the highest overall satisfaction ( 856 on a 1,000 point scale )			1
satisfaction drops to 724 points -- 53 points below the industry average -- when guests did n't interact with anyone besides check - in staff			1
" with self - service check in and mobile check - in , there 's a presumption that if you can avoid people and the interaction , you 're creating a better experience , " said @entity1			0
" overall , we see that 's not the case			0
the more interactions you have on property , the better you feel about the experience			0
" check in : @entity110 's best airport hotels what can guests do ? think about what you want and need in a hotel and do online research to figure out which hotels will satisfy those wants and needs			1
it turns out the most satisfied guests , just 7 % in this study , turn out to be those who research their trips using online hotel review sites and use information to seek out hotels they like			1
those folks -- categorized in the study as scrutinizers -- report guest satisfaction at 114 points above the industry average , according to the study			2
for guests who chose a hotel primarily because of price , satisfaction is significantly lower -- 59 points below average satisfaction			1
now in its 17th year , the @entity12 study measures overall guest satisfaction using these seven factors : reservation ; check - in / check - out ; guest room ; food and beverage ( not in the upper extended stay ) ; hotel services ; hotel facilities ; and cost and fees			2
what do you need and want from your hotel ? what is your preferred @entity158 hotel chain ?			0

problems with hotel @entity16 are top concerns
customers who interact with hotel staff report high satisfaction
guests who research their stays *ahead* of time also enjoy their hotels more
