@entity0 -- debate is rife in @entity4 political circles about whether carbon trading is the way forward for climate change abatement			1
carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions			1
there , prime minister @entity10 is looking to introduce a mandatory carbon trading system by 2010 which will cap the amount of pollution industry can release			1
the proposed @entity4 system will be similar to the @entity17 emission trading system which was established in 2005			2
with phase 1 of the @entity21 system complete , there are a few lessons about carbon trading that @entity4 -- and other countries looking to go down this path -- could benefit from			1
so what is carbon trading ? carbon trading -- also known as " cap and trade " -- is a system designed to cut the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming			1
generally in a market - based cap and trade system , a central authority -- such as a government or international body -- sets a limit on the amount of carbon which can be emitted and then divides this amount into units which are allocated to different groups			2
these units can then be traded as any commodity would			0
carbon trading can occur both between countries and amongst industries within countries			1
a second approach to carbon trading involves a country or business generating carbon credits by investing in " green " projects -- usually in developing countries -- that are said to reduce emissions			1
why is it necessary ? according to the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) there is unequivocal evidence that human activities have contributed to a gradual warming of the planet which has resulted in a change in climate			0
the @entity59 report provides scientific evidence of change including to the duration of seasons , rainfall patterns and an increased frequency of extreme weather events			0
industrialization is recognized as a key factor in the increase in greenhouse gas ( @entity78 ) emissions in the atmosphere and according to the @entity59 the world has warmed by an average of 0.74 ° c in the past 100 years			1
the @entity59 predicts that if @entity78 emissions continue to rise at their current rate , this century will see a further 3 ° c rise in the average world temperature			0
while the consensus of the scientific community ( via the @entity59 ) is that action must be taken to avert the worst impacts of climate change , economic arguments about the cost of climate change abatement -- advanced by countries like the @entity93 and at one time @entity4 -- have in the past proved an impediment to action			0
a carbon trading system is said to be one way that countries can look to make greenhouse gas emissions cuts with minimal economic impact			1
do you think carbon trading is the way to reduce greenhouse emissions ? what trading systems exist ? established in 2005 , the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) is the largest multi-national , multi-sector co2 trading system in the world			1
the ultimate aim of the system is to ensure that @entity117 are compliant with their @entity119 commitments and to do this the most energy - intensive industries are allocated carbon permits by @entity123 which allow them to emit a certain amount of @entity126			0
if these companies want to emit more co2 than their permits allow for , they are able to buy them from more efficient companies with spare permits			0
the @entity112 takes in around 12,000 installations which account for around 50 percent of @entity17 greenhouse gas emissions from industries such as power , steel and cement manufacture			1
according the @entity140 , the @entity112 contributed $ 50 billion of the $ 64 billion traded in the carbon market in 2007			0
the second largest carbon trading system exists under the @entity143 @entity119			1
the protocol -- which sets binding emission targets for 37 industrialized countries -- permits emissions trading in order to help countries meet their agreed upon targets			2
countries have agreed to an average 5 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions , compared to 1990 levels , by 2012 and carbon trading is one way to meet this quota			1
by december 2008 , the @entity112 will link up with the @entity143 trading system to create a more global scheme			0
the @entity159 is a further carbon trading mechanism of the protocol which allows industrialized nations to claim emission credits from investment in clean technologies which will " offset " carbon in developing countries			1
developed nations can also finance emission reduction projects in developing countries through @entity171 in exchange for emission credits			0
@entity174 has established a mandatory carbon trading system this year and @entity4 has also committed to expanding the pioneering @entity176 to a national market by 2010			1
new mandatory systems are being considered for @entity179 and @entity180			0
voluntary carbon markets also exist , with the @entity182 one of the more established ones			0
what do permits cost ? the cost of a carbon permit is dictated by the market forces of supply and demand			0
in 2007 , one @entity193 ( for one ton of carbon ) was trading at $ 30 to $ 35			2
what industries are subject to trading ? under mandatory schemes like the @entity112 , it 's the most energy - intensive industries within @entity123 which are subject to carbon trading			2
this includes industries like power installations , steel and cement manufacture and the construction industry			0
the commercial aviation industry -- which accounts for 3 percent of @entity17 emissions -- could be brought into the @entity112 by 2011			0
currently personal or household emissions and the public sector and transport industry emissions are not included in any carbon trading system			1
has emissions trading been successful ? yes and no. the introduction of mandatory systems which cap emissions like the @entity112 is a step in the right direction for trying to cut emissions without a major cost to business			2
however , critics such as @entity222 argue that the current carbon trade systems are flawed because there is a tendency for the biggest polluters to be over-allocated permits			2
this was clearly evident with phase 1 of the @entity112 when the market virtually collapsed in 2006 because too many allowances were allocated			0
market analyst @entity232 estimated that the @entity234 's most polluting companies made windfall profits of around $ 1.7 billion as a direct result of generous carbon credit allocation under the @entity112			0
questions have also been raised about whether carbon trading systems actually reduce @entity78 emissions			1
independent @entity234 think - tank @entity241 reported that between 2005 and 2006 emissions from industries covered by the @entity112 actually rose in @entity234 by 3.6 percent and by 0.8 percent across the whole of @entity21			2
auctioning off carbon credits at the outset -- rather that simply allocating credits to business for free -- is one way that has been proposed to help the system make a real impact on emissions			2
certainly , increasing the scarcity of carbon credits would help ensure that businesses commit to genuine low - carbon alternatives			0
while carbon emissions account for around 70 percent of greenhouse gases , they are not the sole cause of climate change and it would seem a safer bet to reinforce a carbon trading system with other legislative measures aimed at reducing emissions .			1

carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
existing carbon trading systems have had limited impact on emissions to date
the @entity21 experience serves as a good lesson for new trading systems
