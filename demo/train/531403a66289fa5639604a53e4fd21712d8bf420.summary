the @entity2 takeover of the @entity4 capital of @entity5 plunges the country into a yet darker chapter of its troubled modern history			1
an uneasy and sometimes violent standoff between @entity2 fighters and forces loyal to president @entity12 took on the appearance of a coup tuesday , before a tentative power - sharing agreement was announced wednesday , pulling the country back from the brink			1
but the deal is far from certain , with previous accords between the government and @entity2 rebels having collapsed quickly			2
@entity12 is now essentially powerless , as of wednesday a prisoner inside his own home			0
as @entity4 collapses into warring factions , and the @entity24 surveys the wreckage with few good options , one party besides the @entity2 seems set to benefit : @entity28			1
the @entity2 are @entity29 from northern @entity4 and make up about 30 % of the population			1
they 've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade			0
at the beginning of 2014 , they won a series of battles close to the @entity39 border			0
and in september , @entity2 fighters suddenly descended on @entity5			2
they took over government buildings , the main airport and a share of power			2
negotiations ensued , while @entity2 seized other towns , cities and areas , including the port of @entity50 on the @entity51			2
they continued to build up their presence in @entity5 , and two weeks ago held a huge rally to celebrate the @entity56 's birthday			0
one of the @entity2 ' slogans is daubed on walls in the capital : " @entity62 , death to @entity61 , damn the @entity63 , victory to @entity65			2
" now , apparently unhappy with the shape of a draft constitution , they 've gone for broke			0
the @entity2 ' power grab gave @entity70 the best recruiting sergeant they could hope for			1
always virulently anti-shia , @entity70 was quick to proclaim itself as the defender of the @entity74 against the " rafidah , " a derogatory term meaning " those who reject			2
" " do not leave a checkpoint for ( the @entity2 ) that you do not strike , nor a headquarters that you do not bomb , nor a troop carrier that you do not explode , " said one of @entity70 's leaders , @entity78 , in a video released last september , according to a translation by @entity82			1
@entity70 's first response was a devastating suicide bombing of a @entity2 rally in @entity5 , which killed nearly 50 people			1
it has stepped up attacks against the army and police , which it claims have been infiltrated by @entity2 militia			2
just last sunday , it claimed responsibility for killing dozens of @entity2 in sniper attacks , bombings and rocket attacks across the country			0
the authority of the government in @entity4 has never been very strong , in a country of fierce tribal loyalties			2
now as it collapses , @entity4 may divide into areas controlled by the @entity2 and areas controlled by others , with @entity70 free to expand in remote southern and eastern provinces			1
some tribes have already made common cause with @entity70 in the face of the encroaching @entity2 threat			1
@entity4 is close to becoming a failing state ; the sort of place where @entity28 incubates quickly			0
two years ago , @entity70 fighters swept through southern @entity4 , seizing a number of towns			1
it took government forces , aided by an aggressive @entity24 drone campaign , months to eject them			0
now , @entity70 may be in a position to strike out again			0
@entity24 officials say @entity70 still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb - making know - how with jihadists in @entity132 , specifically with the @entity133 , reputed to be an @entity28 " a team " based in @entity132			0
@entity70 chief bomb - maker @entity135 has three times plotted to bring down @entity24 - bound aircraft , coming closest to success on christmas day in 2009 when a @entity141 recruit attempted to blow up a bomb in his underwear in the skies above @entity145			0
@entity4 's battle lines are now drawn on much starker @entity148 sectarian lines , echoing recent developments in @entity132 and @entity150			1
but in all three countries , there is also a struggle for leadership of @entity74 , between the jihadists like @entity28 and @entity156 and less extreme groups			0
in @entity4 , the @entity158 -- in the shape of the @entity160 -- is a powerful group well represented in the transitional government			1
it loathes the @entity2 and has its own militias			0
the fighting in @entity4 provides an opening to @entity156 , which is keen to outflank @entity28 and prove itself the true defender of the faith			2
in november , @entity156 leader @entity167 called on @entity4 @entity74 to resist the @entity2			1
" oh soldiers of @entity4 ... oh people of support and aid ... people of wisdom and faith ... be harsh against the @entity175 , for they are kuffar apostates , " he said in an audio message			0
" fight them and overcome them			0
" some @entity4 jihadists , including former mid-level @entity70 commander @entity180 , have already declared their support for @entity156 and @entity167			1
a fratricidal battle within the broader war for @entity4 , the ancestral homeland of @entity184 , may become part of an ever - more chaotic scene			0
@entity4 officials have frequently accused @entity188 of providing financial support and weapons to the @entity2 in an effort to control @entity4 's @entity51 coast , on one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes			1
president @entity12 himself alleged the @entity2 were being trained and advised by @entity197 , the @entity198 @entity29 militia			1
@entity39 , which provides energy and financial support to @entity4 and shares a long border with it , is looking on with growing anxiety , fearful of @entity29 - dominated states on both its eastern and western flanks			1
inside @entity4 , the @entity2 appear to be getting help from forces still loyal to the former president , @entity207 , who clung to power until forced out by international pressure two years ago , handing the reins to @entity12 , his longtime vice president			1
@entity207 has never accepted retirement , despite serious injuries suffered in a bomb attack in 2011			0
and through an opportunistic alliance with the @entity2 , he has clawed his way back onto the scene , infuriating @entity217			0
in november , the @entity24 government imposed sanctions on @entity207 , saying " he had reportedly become one of the primary supporters of violence perpetrated by individuals affiliated with the @entity2 group			1
" " more recently , as of september 2014 , @entity207 reportedly has been destabilizing @entity4 by using others to undermine the central government and create enough instability to threaten a coup , " the @entity226 said			2
that threat has now been realized			0
@entity4 may be poor , but it occupies strategic real estate alongside one of the world 's most important shipping lanes			1
and much of that real estate is now ripe for exploitation by @entity28 's most effective franchise , as it battles a group that looks for moral support , and maybe more , from @entity240			0
as violence flares , 7 things to know about @entity4			0
