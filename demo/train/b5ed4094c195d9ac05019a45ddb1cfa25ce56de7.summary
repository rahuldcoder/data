-- last week , members of the @entity2 turned their attention to the biggest @entity5 scandal yet			1
no , i do not mean the @entity7 or @entity8			0
those are more partisan witch hunt than true scandal , a point backed up by recent @entity0 polling that shows independents and moderates trust the @entity17 's take			0
i also do not mean the investigations of @entity19 or @entity21 reporter @entity20			0
both are worrying cases of the national security state trumping freedom of the press , but neither appear to have made it to the president 's desk			0
and i hate to break it to the many fans of the hit tv show " scandal , " but that is not what i am referring to , either			0
this is the real scandal : president @entity5 said in his second inaugural address that failing to act on climate change would " betray future generations			2
" now , many expect that he is ready to do exactly that by approving the @entity41			2
last week , the @entity42 voted to take the decision out of @entity5 's hands			1
in fact , @entity46 -- the @entity5 campaign organization that speaks for the president through his @entity49 and @entity50 accounts -- recently told activists that because the president has not taken a position on the pipeline , they should take their advocacy elsewhere			1
even more scandalous : the @entity17 appears to be basing its decision on myths			0
@entity41 is not just another pipeline moving " oil			1
" it would carry chemically treated tar sands			1
a few years ago this tar leaked into the @entity64 in @entity65			0
three years and $ 1 billion later , the @entity64 may never come back			0
tar sands is not traditional oil			1
it is a pipe - eating , planet - cooking , water - fouling goo that nobody knows how to get out of our water			1
@entity41 will not make us energy independent			2
the foreign company behind the pipeline , @entity79 , itself admits that the pipeline is key to getting tar sands to the world market			1
the company made no promises to sell any of that oil to the @entity85			1
the @entity41 will bring dirty fuel through @entity85 , not to @entity85			1
as for the jobs we were promised , the president 's own @entity87 says @entity41 will create only 35 permanent jobs			1
if president @entity5 buys these myths , he should embrace this project publicly			2
he should call it the " @entity95			0
" he should show up at the ribbon cutting			0
if he refuses to do that and still approves @entity41 , the first thing that pipeline will run over is his credibility on climate			2
now , that is a scandal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity104 .			0

@entity104 : @entity5 might ok @entity41 pipeline , betraying his *environmental* vows
@entity104 : @entity41 's tar sands not traditional oil , it 's a pipe - eating goo that fouls water
keystone pipeline brings dirty fuel through @entity85 to world markets , not to @entity85 , he says
@entity104 : @entity87 says @entity41 will create only 35 permanent jobs
