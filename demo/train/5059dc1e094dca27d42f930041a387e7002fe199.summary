-- here 's a 21st - century art object if ever there was one : a @entity4 film by a @entity7 - @entity6 writer - director based on a 1987 international best - seller named after a 1965 @entity10 ' song about @entity12 pine			1
well , that 's not all the song is about			1
according to @entity16 , it was conceived as a deliberately opaque reference to an extramarital flirtation ( he did n't want his wife to know about it ) that went nowhere			2
the narrator sleeps in the bath , then torches the place in the morning			0
@entity26 's lovely but overly languorous film of the acclaimed @entity28 novel catches at the sexual longing and consternation that both the book and @entity16 's song evoke : the tantalizing co-mingling of desire , mixed signals and cross purposes that can derail a tentative relationship			1
@entity26 ( who also wrote the screenplay ) follows @entity28 's slender plotline with respect bordering on devotion , but fails to find a correlative to the complex , overlapping perspectives that allow the novel to live in both the present and the past -- to enter into the mindset of adolescent angst , and to contemplate it from afar			1
instead the film flails between too many lengthy , numb exchanges and a handful of spectacular but histrionic set pieces			0
@entity52 ( @entity53 ) is a freshman at @entity54 in the late 1960s			0
he 's largely impervious to the political upheaval going on around him , still struggling to come to terms with the sudden suicide of his best friend , @entity59 , on his 17th birthday			2
in their grief , @entity52 and @entity59 's girlfriend , @entity62 ( @entity63 of " @entity64 " ) , spend many hours consoling each other , and on her 20th birthday they finally sleep together			2
the next day , @entity62 quits school and retires to a sanatorium , leaving the confused @entity52 to muddle his way through classes			0
while he and @entity62 correspond in long , intimate letters , @entity52 takes up with another girl ( or should i say , she takes up with him ? )			0
@entity76 ( @entity77 ) is as self - confident and assertive as @entity62 is vulnerable and timid			0
@entity52 , meanwhile , is a distinctly passive and bewildered protagonist , unsure of what he wants or what his obligations might be to the broken , suicidal @entity62			1
the performances are credible enough , but neither the passive , vacillating @entity52 nor the neurotic , grief - stricken @entity62 are easy figures to identify with , and it 's hard to understand why so many women keep throwing themselves at @entity53 's clay feet			1
only @entity77 's assertive @entity76 offers any energy , and she 's sidelined for much of the movie			1
while the movie has moments to savor and artistry to spare , these elements do n't cohere into a satisfying whole			1
@entity26 does n't speak @entity4 , but in other respects he 's well - suited to @entity28 's world			1
a @entity6 brought up and educated in @entity7 , best known for " @entity96 " and " the @entity97 , " @entity26 is a cinematic aesthete , very much attuned to melancholy and introspection			0
" @entity107 " features a tumescent score by @entity102 's @entity101 and stunning cinematography by the @entity105 @entity104 ( " in the @entity106 " )			2
it 's so gorgeous to look at that spectators are in danger of swooning in their seats			2
it 's rather irritating that the characters prefer to wallow in misery than admire the natural beauty all around them -- including each other , of course			0
and that 's the trouble			0
the film feels like a fetish object ; almost a series of screen prints , it 's a beautiful illustration of the text , but somehow the text itself is lost in translation .			0

*critic* : director follows @entity28 's slender plot with respect bordering on devotion
protagonist is passive and bewildered , unsure of what he wants , @entity137 says
he says movie has moments to savor , but these elements do n't cohere into satisfying whole
