-- parents of children with special needs are demanding an apology from conservative political pundit @entity5 for tweeting after tuesday 's foreign policy debate that she approved of " @entity9 's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard			1
" it appeared to be a response to critiques of @entity9 's debate performance , but it was n't the first time @entity17 used the " the r - word " during this election season			1
and , it 's not the first time blogger @entity21 has called her out on it			1
" at this point , i 'm thinking the woman must surely be aware that the word is offensive , and she chooses not to care			1
that 's pretty vile and heartless , " said @entity21 , the mother of a special needs child who shares her world on the blog " love that @entity31 " " you want to slam the president , go ahead			1
but you ca n't think of any other word to use ? come on			2
" ending the r - word : @entity37 it or understand it ? the word " retard " demeans @entity39 and millions more with intellectual disabilities , @entity21 tweeted at @entity17			1
still , the comment was favorited 1,215 times and earned 2,993 retweets as of this writing , presumably by a number of people who did n't find it offensive			2
but sentiments from those who chose to respond to @entity17 on @entity52 ranged from disappointment to outrage			2
that man is the president of this country			2
( & i 'm sure all of the disabled children in @entity61 appreciate you			0
) , " actor @entity62 tweeted			0
" politics aside , this tweet from @ anncoulter was offensive & disgusting			2
any use of the " r " word is unacceptable , " @ amurphy217 said			2
the @entity69 also condemned her use of the word , saying that it was " sad to see @ @entity72 continue her use of hateful language by using the # @entity75 in her discourse			2
" in an open letter directed at @entity17 posted tuesday on the @entity69 blog , @entity77 , a 30 - year - old @entity78 with @entity79 , described what the word meant to him : " i thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the president as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you , but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow @entity69 have			1
" then i wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says , as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next			0
... well , ms. @entity5 , you , and society , need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor			2
no one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much			0
" even people known for their sense of humor came out against it			0
comedian and @entity52 personality @ @entity113 resurfaced a 2 - year - old post from his tumblr in which he explained why he would no longer follow anyone he saw using " the r - word			1
" he re-posted it after seeing people retweeting and favoriting the tweet , which he found disturbing coming from a a " well - educated , self - described @entity122 with such a huge public presence			0
" he hopes she 'll read it and maybe have a change of heart , but he 's not necessarily counting on it			0
what do you think of @entity17 's comment ? sound off with @entity131 " based upon @entity5 's tweets today , i 'd say she 's dug in and unrepentant , " he said tuesday in an e-mail			1
" she must not know , love or respect anyone with an intellectual disability , then , and more 's the pity			0
i 'd like to see her after a great day of volunteering at a @entity69 or @entity140 event			0
i 'd lay odds she 'd never think or say the r - word word ever again , and she 'd probably be quick to anger if someone she heard did so			1
" others observing the controversy surmised that @entity17 used the word solely to draw attention			0
the only thing that will kill her ? @entity155 & utter indifference , " @ @entity157 tweeted			0
@entity158 banned the use of the words " retard " and " retardation " in 2010 in federal health , education and labor laws in favor of using the words " intellectual disability			0
" the @entity168 also plans to replace the term " mental retardation " with " intellectual development disorder " in the fifth version of @entity173 , to be published by in 2013			0
then why do people cling to the word , @entity21 and people like her wonder			1
she has posed the question before in her blog , which is probably why she woke this morning to find a slew of tweets and e-mails asking her to call out @entity17 again for repeatedly using " the r - word " to describe president @entity183			1
the last time was just a few weeks ago in a blog post called " let 's talk about people who cling to the word ' retard			1
' " in the post , she recounted a series of recent examples of the word being used : in a @entity199 article , in the comments of a @entity197 video she made for the @entity69 ' annual campaign to end the use of the word , in the comments section of a @entity0 article			0
she also included @entity17 's last tweet about a video the president made for the @entity208 : " been busy , but is @entity209 talking about that video ? i had no idea how crucial the retarded vote is in this election			1
" " many people think that using the word ' retard ' to slam someone is fineâ € ” as long as it 's not actually directed at a person with disability			1
i 've had plenty of people argue with me over that distinction			0
what people do n't understand is that every time someone uses the word ' retard , ' they perpetuate the idea that people with intellectual disability , like my son , @entity39 , are stupid or losers , " @entity21 said in an e-mail tuesday			1
" as i 've said before , my son should n't be defined by ghosts of stereotypes past			0
he has enough to contend with in this world			0
" do you use the " r - word " ? do you object to its use ? please share your opinions respectfully in the comments section below			1
" like " @entity246 on @entity247 .			0
