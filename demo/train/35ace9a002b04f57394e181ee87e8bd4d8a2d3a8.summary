@entity0 -- if we want to build a stronger , more sustainable world for future generations , one with more partners and fewer enemies , we have to work together			1
former president @entity7 says that everyone can do something to improve the lives of others			1
the challenges of our day transcend politics , religion , geography and gender -- and in turn , so must we			2
this has been a month of historical calamities , natural and man - made , from @entity21 to @entity22 , but the work of the @entity24 shows that corporate responsibility need n't fluctuate with the market			1
this week almost 60 heads of state , hundreds of @entity28 , five @entity30 laureates , dozens of leading philanthropists and global leaders -- including both @entity34 presidential candidates -- are taking part in our fourth @entity36			2
we launched it in 2005 with a simple concept : invite a diverse group of global leaders to @entity0 , challenge them to work together on the world 's most pressing challenges , give them concrete opportunities to do so , and require that in order to return the next year , they make a commitment to take action to address a global challenge of their choice			1
since we started , the leaders at @entity24 have made more than 1,000 " commitments to action " valued at more than $ 30 billion to improve the lives of 200 million people in 150 countries			1
this wednesday , we 'll see returning faces , and also many leaders who will be attending for the first time			2
as we have in years past , we 'll be discussing many of the major challenges of our time , including poverty and economic empowerment , energy and climate change , health and education			2
one of the most important conversations will be about global warming and the specific clean energy opportunities that we have -- at all levels of government and society -- to create jobs , increase growth , enhance security , fight global warming and sustain our sources of food and clean water			0
i 'm honored that sen. @entity86 and sen. @entity87 have agreed to talk about these issues with us			0
while @entity24 brings leaders together to discuss and learn about issues , our real focus is on action -- and on measurable results			1

more than 4 million people have been reached with clean energy services , and more than 3 million have increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation			0
forty - two million children have benefited from interventions that address malnutrition or under nutrition			0
these impacts and their ripples are reshaping our world , and strengthening the bonds of our common purpose and humanity			0
this year , we 're building on this energy and expanding cgi to more people in more regions			2
in march , we held the first meeting of @entity119 at @entity120 in @entity121			0
hundreds of college students and university officials from the @entity34 and other nations attended and made commitments that range from reducing greenhouse gas emissions on their campuses to creating medical backpacks for roving doctors in @entity131			0
everyone at @entity119 -- including @entity133 and myself -- also worked on a service project in the @entity136 of @entity121 , helping to prepare construction sites for new homes for people who had been uprooted by @entity140			0
in the spirit of building a world with more partners and fewer enemies , i 'll be traveling to @entity145 this december for the first meeting of @entity24 outside of @entity0			1
this meeting will include leaders and issues of importance in @entity151 , an increasingly important part of the 21st century world			1
@entity151 leaders have a large and growing capacity to shape our economy , climate , health and security , and i 'm honored that @entity160 and other leaders already have confirmed their participation			1
you do n't need to be rich or powerful to do something to make a difference			0
people from more than 190 countries already have made their own commitment using our web site			0
no matter how much or how little money you have in your pocket , or the amount of free time in your week , or your talents and interests , you can do something to improve the lives of others , and in so doing , strengthen the fabric of our shared humanity			0
that is what @entity24 is all about			1
