-- he 's a best - selling crime novelist from a @entity3 country , but do n't call @entity4 the next @entity5			1
it 's not that @entity4 does n't care for the comparison			1
he just believes it 's misleading			2
the 51 - year old from @entity11 , @entity9 says he has more in common with @entity13 hard - boiled crime fiction			1
@entity4 ( pronounced @entity14 - buh ) is a former professional soccer player , musician and stock broker , who eventually turned to writing			1
he was writing bestsellers for ten years before @entity5 's " @entity19 " was published			1
while his crime novels have sold nine million copies worldwide , he 's just becoming widely known in the @entity13 , but his new novel will likely change that			1
" @entity27 " hit bookstores in the @entity13 last week and is winning raves from @entity13 critics			1
it 's @entity4 's seventh novel featuring police detective and recovering alcoholic , @entity32 ( pronounced @entity31 - leh )			1
it 's a terrifying thriller , about the hunt for a serial killer , who leaves a snowman as his calling card			2
the book is already a bestseller in @entity40 , won @entity9 's novel of the year in 2008 , and appears headed for the big screen			2
" @entity27 " has been optioned by @entity44 films , ironically , the same production company behind the movie version of " @entity19			1
" @entity4 was at the @entity47 last week to promote " headhunters " a movie based on another of his novels			1
he 's now touring a handful of @entity13 cities to promote " @entity27			1
" @entity0 caught up with the author this week			2
the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : for new readers , tell us a little about your main character @entity32			1
@entity4 : it is not easy to summarize the protagonist of the series in a few words , but here are some features of @entity32 's personality that are important to me when i write about him : he 's the type of guy who is driven by his good side as well as his darker side			1
at times he believes in his role as law enforcer , at other times he does n't			2
and occasionally he is so gripped by his emotions that they overwhelm his basic belief in the principles of a state governed by law			2
he hunts down criminals with such an intense hatred and finds revenge so hard to resist that at times he could be mistaken for the antagonists he is fighting			2
but at the same time he can feel empathy for , perhaps even a kinship with , the lawbreaker			2
@entity32 is a hero with pronounced weaknesses			1
all good heroes have an achilles heel , and in @entity32 's case , it is alcohol			1
@entity0 : what 's @entity32 's up against in " @entity27 ? " @entity4 : @entity32 receives an anonymous letter signed " @entity27			1
" a few months later he discovers an alarming resemblance in numerous old disappearances : married women ( who have children ) go missing the day the first snow falls each year			2
@entity0 : how would you describe @entity11 -- where the story takes place ? @entity4 : @entity11 is a cozy little capital , but it is also what you have seen in my books			1
for a while it had the highest number of fatalities from drug overdoses in @entity114			0
there is organized crime , hardcore prostitution , trafficking in drugs and women , and a @entity121 presence			2
it 's a town that has gone through immense changes over the last twenty years			0
it 's still a very beautiful town in one of the richest countries of the world , and it 's safe			0
but there is all the rest , so it 's easier to write about the shady side of @entity11 now than it was twenty years ago			2
i want to describe the contrasts , and to me @entity11 today is a perfect setting for a thriller			0
@entity0 : your novels deal unflinchingly with some dark and complex themes , including @entity32 's alcoholism			1
where do your ideas come from ? @entity4 : i believe that those of us who were afraid of the dark when we were young have an advantage			1
if you pretended you were too big to be afraid of the dark , you closed off part of your brain , but if you let your imagination run , it went wild			0
when i went down to the cellar to get potatoes as a boy , i came back up again with a horror story of novel proportions in my head			0
and when i 'm writing the passage about the woman being chased through the forest , or when @entity32 gets lost , i draw from the fear and horror i experienced myself			1
i 've been lost in a forest myself and felt i was n't far away , but suddenly it became darker and darker , and even though i thought the house was close by , it was n't			2
and then you 're convinced you 're lost			0
your terror is the fuel for your writing			1
i was a lot more afraid of the dark and frightened than my brothers , and i 'm sure it has given me an extra edge and sense of horror			0
i was always the one who had to tell ghost stories when we were small because they could hear the terror in my voice			2
and i was petrified by my own stories			0
i am attracted and fascinated by the dark side			2
i write about it because i 'm curious			0
i 'm curious about everything that is human			0
i 'm not fascinated by suffering for its own sake - torture scenes do n't interest me as such -- but i am fascinated by people who torture , what drives them			0
@entity0 : explain why you say @entity32 's goal is to understand evil and also love			1
@entity4 : @entity32 feels something akin to what the serial killer feels , the same tension and excitement , when he approaches a victim and the same anti-climax after the killer is caught			1
it is @entity32 's ambition to understand both love and evil			1
he is a passionate guy in all ways			0
and he is the type of man who has no control over his impulses			0
the fact that he can not set limits permeates his drinking habits and his attitude to his job			0
he takes on cases and is swallowed up by them			0
it is the same with his relationships with women			0
i could have chosen to make them live happily ever after and have children , but then we have a completely different person , one i find boring			0
i like the fact that he is in transit in his own life , as far as his emotions and his job are concerned			0
when you make a person a hero you are bound to have some things in common with him -- at least a basic set of values if you 're going to understand him			0
i think understanding basic emotions like hate and love is something we spend a lifetime trying to achieve			0
so , yeah , it 's true for me too			0
@entity0 : how has your success impacted your career ? @entity4 : i have less time to write because i have to travel more			1
apart from that i do the same things , i keep my life fairly simple and unchanged because i was perfectly happy with the life i had			0
having millions of readers is not dramatically different from having a few thousand ; you still have to write books and you still wake up in the morning being your own boss , deciding whether you want to get up			0
@entity0 : any thoughts why " @entity251 " has become so popular among readers globally ? @entity4 : the popularity may have to do with the general level of quality in @entity3 crime			1
in the 70s , @entity256 and @entity257 established the crime novel as an art form , as serious writing , and since then many of the best writing talents have turned to the crime novel and used it as a vehicle for their stories			1
@entity0 : did you always want to be a writer ? @entity4 : i come from a family of readers and storytellers			1
my mother was a librarian and my father used to sit in the living room reading every afternoon			0
when i was seven i pulled " @entity279 " off the bookshelf and asked my father to read it to me			0
not so much because i had good taste , but because on the cover there was a picture of a pig 's bloodstained head impaled on a pole			2
my father read and i used to think i could have made the story more exciting myself			0
i had already begun to impress friends my age , and some older children , with my gruesome ghost stories			0
@entity0 : what other authors and artists inspire you ? @entity4 : @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , and @entity301			1
@entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310			0
@entity0 : what 's on your summer reading list ? @entity4 : " @entity314 " by @entity315			1
i read the first half in @entity318 in february , but lost the book			0
now i have a new one			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity4 : my next @entity32 novel , the ninth in the series , will be published in @entity9 next month			1
next year i plan to write a fourth children 's book in my doctor @entity329 series			0
