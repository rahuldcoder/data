-- " baby , law is n't a good profession for girls , " my father told me			1
" stay with music , dear , that is what you and your people do so well , " my high school dean said			1
i was 16 , and asking them the most important question of my life : will you tell me how to become a lawyer ? my dad was a product of the segregated @entity19			1
orphaned at the age of 12 , he pulled himself up by his bootstraps			2
after leaving @entity22 for @entity23 , where he lived with a relative , he attended an integrated school , @entity26			1
eventually , he earned his way into @entity28 , where he was one of the first black men to graduate			2
in spite of his achievements , he and our family faced discrimination			0
nevertheless , he kept his sense of humor , and worked hard to be a good provider			2
my father 's message was loving and protective			0
he did n't want to see me hurt			0
my dean 's message was scornful and discriminatory			0
she took a sledgehammer to my dreams , and when i left her office that day , i was crushed and fighting tears			0
i could n't understand her answer			0
i wanted to go to a good college , attend a respected law school and advocate for people needing help and craving justice			1
i refused to abandon these high hopes			0
opinion : does @entity56 ' get ' women who work ? and i did n't			1
i followed my dreams and went to law school			1
more than 40 years later , i became one of the 10 women named to top policy - making posts in the early months of gov. @entity56 's administration in @entity63			1
there , i headed up the @entity65			0
during gov. @entity56 's tenure , our state led the nation in terms of the ratio of women holding top spots in the administration , and to this day , that 's something about which i am incredibly proud to have been a part of			1
and so , as i 've heard criticism about gov. @entity56 's admirable record of recruiting women to serve in his administration , i feel compelled to speak out about the @entity56 i know			1
i remember meeting him for the first time			0
i was struck by his authenticity , and over the years that i worked with him , i saw the accuracy of my first impression			2
gov. @entity56 's overriding commitment was not to self - promotion -- as is so often the case for politicians -- but for the people he served , and the people he served with			1
he believes in empowering women			2
i would know , because i was one of those women he recruited and respected			2
opinion : @entity56 's empty ' binders full of women ' today , there are more than 5 million women around this country -- mothers , daughters , breadwinners -- who are unemployed			1
they are not only robbed of their dignity and their self - respect ; they are also robbed of the results of decades of hard work			0
more women are in poverty -- 25.7 million -- than at any time in our nation 's history			2
and for too many young people , the doors of opportunity remain closed shut by these tough economic circumstances			2
half of recent college graduates are either jobless or underemployed			0
the cost of college has continued to rise in the last four years and student loan debt stands at record levels			2
when @entity56 was governor , he worked with a legislature that was 87 % @entity127 to get things done			1
and to me , that really meant something : i consider myself a @entity132			0
for him , it was n't about who you were , it was about the quality of your ideas			0
that 's how he improved the economy and balanced the budget , but that 's not all he accomplished			0
gov. @entity56 also initiated the @entity146 and @entity147 to cover the cost of college at public institutions of higher education in the state for deserving high school students based on academic merit			1
during his time as governor , @entity63 maintained its schools ' ranking as first in the nation			1
that 's what @entity56 has stood for while in politics and in business , and that 's what matters to women			1
in government , he created opportunities for young people to attend college			0
in business , he took a chance on people to allow their dreams to flourish into realities			0
i 've been able to rise in life because of people who see the world this way			0
looking back , i 'm grateful to those who believe that education is a civil right and that the dreams of all should be encouraged and cultivated			0
and that 's precisely why i 'm supporting @entity56			1
