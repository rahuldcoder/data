@entity0 -- @entity2 first hit the headlines in 1982			1
a faded clipping from his hometown newspaper in @entity6 , just outside @entity0 , carried a photo of the then 10 - year - old clutching his pet cat " @entity10			1
" the full - page report , titled " @entity12 " told how young @entity2 raced into the burning wreckage of his mother 's corner store and rescued his furry friend			1
three decades later -- in february -- @entity2 's story hit the media again			1
the headline this time : " video of @entity23 suicide bomber released			1
" the reports came just after @entity26 - linked jihadis in @entity27 posted an online video showing a suicide attack on the notorious @entity31 prison			1
president @entity33 's brutal regime was reportedly torturing hundreds of prisoners there			0
the recording showed @entity2 , who made his living in @entity23 driving a highway maintenance truck , crashing into the prison gates at the wheel of a @entity42 - style dump truck			1
thick steel plates had been welded to the cab of the vehicle for protection against enemy gunfire			0
" i miss my son so much			0
he was a good boy , " his mother @entity51 whispered to me during our conversation at her home in @entity6 , about an hour 's drive from central @entity0			2
she said she came with her husband from @entity58 to @entity23 almost 60 years ago			1
her two sons and a daughter were born and raised in @entity61			2
photos from the family album show the @entity2 children had what appeared to be a fairly normal @entity23 childhood			1
when @entity2 reached adulthood he married and is survived by his wife and three teenage children			1
@entity2 's elder brother @entity70 has rarely spoken publicly since the suicide bombing			1
but he made clear that 's not out of shame			2
" we feel no shame whatsoever , " he said			0
" whatever [ my brother @entity77 ] @entity77 did , his intentions were bona fide and true to the heart			1
his whole purpose was to save people in that prison who had been tortured and raped			2
" in the video depicting his final moments , @entity2 appears calm as camouflage - clad @entity87 jihadis wrap their arms around his shoulders			1
@entity27 rebel sources say that unit had recently defected from @entity92 to the @entity26 - affiliated @entity93			2
his childhood friend @entity94 , who traveled to @entity27 with him , said @entity2 appeared composed			1
" he was obviously at peace , " @entity94 told me			0
" the idea was n't troubling him in any way			0
i can only put that down to faith and the idea he knew where he was going			0
" an electrician and plumber by trade , @entity94 returned to @entity6 about a month before @entity2 blew himself to smithereens in that attack at the start of february			1
@entity94 and @entity2 volunteered as drivers on an aid convoy operated by a group of @entity23 - based @entity112 charities in late july 2013			1
a handful of @entity114 are currently being investigated by @entity23 authorities on suspicion they may have been funnelling @entity23 fighters to extremist groups in @entity27 or may have violated fund - raising rules by donating cash to radical groups			1
" there was lot of talk of convoys going down there and taking aid , " @entity94 said			0
" @entity77 just raised the issue and asked me how i felt , so i turned round and said let 's do it			0
" once in northern @entity27 , not far from the @entity134 border , the pair volunteered to stay on , helping civilians in refugee camps			2
@entity2 's truck driving skills were in high demand			1
he also knew how to operate diggers and helped build new camps and lay drainage pipes			2
@entity94 described the myriad @entity27 rebel groups as a " people 's resistance force " and said most people in the refugee camps had relatives fighting against the @entity33 regime			2
they frequently saw gun - trucks and heavily armed rebels driving through			2
they regularly saw fighters from all the factions , including @entity92 and @entity93 , in the camps , sometimes bringing supplies to stranded civilians			2
" @entity92 would come and help as would the other groups , " he said			0
" you 'd hear about people swapping from group to group unsure of whom to fight with			0
young people would be promoting their group			0
it did n't really seem to matter too much whom you were fighting for			0
" but @entity94 said he had no idea his friend @entity2 had been recruited			1
the soon - to - be bomber had sent his family plenty of pictures showing him hard at work in tent camps			1
many of the snaps showed him surrounded by children			0
in one , he was even wearing flashing " @entity180 " ears in an apparent effort to brighten up daily life for youngsters around him			0
according to his brother , @entity2 never made a farewell phone call to his family			1
the last time he phoned in january , his family assumed it was just a routine weekly catch - up			1
" in retrospect i should perhaps have paid more attention to that phone conversation , " his brother @entity70 told me			1
" he said he loved us all very much			0
he said i know you 're looking after the family and if i 've done any wrongs i hope you can forgive me			0
" he never phoned again			0
behind him in the small family garden , filled with summer flowers , his mother shed silent tears			1
" i do n't know what happened			0
i just do n't know			0
only @entity203 knows , " she said			0
neither family nor friends say they had any inkling @entity2 was planning to blow himself up			1
there were contradictory reports about how successful the attack was			0
some accounts suggested more than 300 prisoners had been freed			0
other reports claimed @entity2 detonated the truck short of its intended target			1
his brother , though , describes the infamous @entity217 as a " legitimate military target			0
" " if he had been a @entity23 soldier and carried out that brave act of heroism , he would have been awarded the posthumous @entity224 , " he said , referring to the @entity23 military 's highest honor for valor			1
unsurprisingly , the @entity23 government did not agree			1
@entity23 intelligence services estimate that more than 500 @entity23 nationals may be fighting with isis or other jihadi groups in @entity27 or @entity229			2
and @entity23 prime minister @entity230 has announced new measures to crack down on @entity233 extremism and block @entity23 returning from conflict zones in the @entity235			2
" our family did n't have time to grieve			0
as soon as we took a breath the police were knocking on our door to carry out searches under the @entity244 , " @entity239 said			0
since his death , police and media investigations have revealed @entity2 's alleged links to radical @entity233 in @entity23			1
in an interview with a @entity0 newspaper , @entity27 - born imam @entity249 claimed @entity2 had been his driver on an unspecified number of visits to @entity6 between 1996 and 2004			1
the @entity23 government excluded @entity255 from @entity23 in 2005 , accusing him of being a hate preacher			2
the same newspaper report alleged @entity2 had been friends with two @entity112 men -- also from @entity6 -- convicted in 2007 of plotting to bomb a @entity0 nightclub			1
@entity239 explained his brother had chauffeured @entity255 on a " few " occasions but did not share his radical interpretation of @entity233			0
" he was n't as , press speculation says , a jihadist , a man born to fight			0
he had no instances of violence at all in the @entity23			2
he was not a threat to the @entity23 public , " @entity239 said			2
@entity2 does not fit the profile , being promoted by the government , of a @entity112 misfit living a deprived existence , easy prey for radical @entity276 preachers or online recruiters			2
his brother says it was perhaps the sight of civilians suffering in the war in @entity27 or horror stories of the @entity33 regime 's action that may have pushed @entity2 to become a suicide bomber			1
but he 's sure that , if he had realized in time , he would have tried to halt his brother 's mission			0
" if i had known i would have told him please do n't do it , " @entity239 said			0
" please , please , please			0
you 're much better off being alive so you can help all those people			0
