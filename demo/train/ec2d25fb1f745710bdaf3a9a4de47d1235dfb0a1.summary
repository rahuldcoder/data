from the start , some passengers knew something was amiss			0
the flight attendant had asked them if the plane was in @entity5			1
then came dueling announcements from two flight attendants , the first saying the plane had mechanical problems ; the second assuring passengers everything was ok			1
then , alarmingly , the increasingly excited flight attendant repeatedly declared over the public address system that she was no longer responsible for the safety of the plane , and that it was going to crash			1
the whole time , the plane continued rolling toward the runway			0
the friday morning incident ended only after fellow crew members scuffled with their colleague , and when passengers helped restrain her , according to passengers interviewed by @entity26			1
authorities said the flight was delayed , and that two flight attendants -- including the agitated attendant -- were taken to a @entity7 hospital for treatment			1
local and federal officials said they do not anticipate criminal charges , adding to speculation that she may have suffered a mental breakdown			1
one passenger said the flight attendant described herself as bi-polar , and said she had not taken her medication			1
the unusual incident put public focus on the nation 's flight attendants , who more often are viewed as the people tasked with mediating disputes or dealing with others ' aberrant behavior			1
but on friday morning , the flight attendant in the forward cabin of @entity52 -- a @entity7 to @entity54 flight -- became the focus of attention			1
" she was acting weird from the very beginning , " said @entity57 , a @entity7 resident seated in the second row			2
" when we first got on the plane she was asking the passenger next to me if we were in @entity5 and where we were going			2
we kind of thought she was just making a joke			0
" but " before we were even taxiing she was talking about how we needed to do more cross-checks , or we needed more testing , or go back for more security , something like that , " @entity57 said			0
@entity57 and other passengers said the flight attendant got on the public address system , and appeared to be calling the pilots			1
at first , " everybody was laughing because it sounded like she ( had ) accidentally turned on " the intercom , said @entity76 of @entity77 , @entity78 , who witnessed the incident from her ninth - row seat			2
then other flight attendants intervened , " telling her to turn off the @entity87 , not to talk like that , " @entity76 said			0
the flight attendant continued her disjointed announcements , passengers said			1
she said , " ok , if you ( pilots ) do n't hear me , then i give up			0
i 'm not responsible if this plane crashes , " @entity76 said			2
she also " said something about opening the doors			0
" " everybody was starting to look at each other , like ' oh , my @entity99 , what 's going on here ? ' " @entity76 said			0
said @entity57 , " two or three times over the @entity87 , she talks about how the planes is going to crash , how she does n't want the plane to crash on her watch			2
" while some of her sentences were clear , others were just " random gibberish , " @entity57 said			0
when the flight attendant said the plane was likely to crash , " the passenger behind me ... said , ' i 'm calling 9 - 1 - 1 , ' " said passenger @entity109 , who was sitting in the middle of the plane			1
" because ... the plane was n't stopping			2
we were already on the runway , we were about literally ( to ) take off			0
" passengers said other flight attendants and an off - duty pilot scuffled with the flight attendant over control of the microphone , and several passengers jumped in to subdue the woman			1
it took about five people to restrain her , they said			0
they " threw her into the first row of seats and held her down , " @entity76 said			0
@entity76 said the flight attendant started " screaming bloody murder , " sounding " demonic			2
" the attendant was taken to the hospital for evaluation , officials said			2
a second flight attendant who may have been injured while restraining the first one also was taken to the hospital			1
an airline spokesman acknowledged the incident but said passengers were not in danger			0
" we continue to investigate the details and circumstances , " @entity148 spokesman @entity147 said			0
" we will ensure that the affected flight attendants receive proper care , and we commend our other crew members for their assistance in quickly getting the aircraft back to the gate so that customers could be reaccommodated , " he said			0
" our customers were not in danger at any time			0
" @entity162 spokeswoman @entity161 said no federal charges were filed and the agency sees no need for further investigation			1
after the crew was replaced , the flight departed for @entity54 at 9:46 a.m. local time , about an hour behind schedule .			1
