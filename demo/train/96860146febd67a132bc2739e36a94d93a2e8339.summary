@entity0 -- of @entity4 's 12 million immigrants , about 2 - 3 million of them live in @entity0 , according to the @entity5 it 's a high proportion for a city of 11 million people			1
in 2013 tensions turned violent with mass street protests and several killings believed to be motivated by nationalist sentiment			2
@entity14 on by ethnically @entity4 residents demanding justice after an @entity18 migrant allegedly killed a young @entity4 man , police made mass arrests of people from the @entity22 or @entity23			1
nationalist groups followed suit , hunting for people with non-slavic faces , though they planned to do more than just detain them for questions			0
for a month , police conducted raids at markets throughout @entity0 where illegal immigrants were believed to be working			1
the biggest raid was in october at the @entity35 market , when about 1,000 workers were rounded up by police			1
the incident was widely covered by @entity4 media			1
i saw the opportunity to do something i have always wanted to do -- see what life is like in @entity4 for migrant workers , or , as they are called here , " gastarbaiters "			1
many of these workers are from my homeland , @entity48			2
after the collapse of the @entity50 , @entity48 was the hardest hit of the former republics			0
that fact is still evident today			0
nearly half of @entity48 's gdp comes from money sent home by migrant workers in @entity4			1
the abundance of workers from @entity48 stems from the ease with which @entity62 can find employment in @entity4			1
all that is required is medical insurance and a work permit			0
so i pretended to be a migrant from @entity48 in desperate need of a job			1
i found a guy named @entity72 who worked at the @entity35 market where the biggest raid happened			2
he agreed to help me get a job as a guest worker			2
he also told me what the police raid was like , saying that even he was taken to the police station , despite his @entity4 passport			1
police had taken everyone without asking questions , he said			0
when the detained workers arrived at the station by the busloads , policemen said anyone who did not want to go into the building could give them a bribe and leave			2
three people allegedly paid 5,000 rubles ( $ 140 ) and left , as @entity72 and other workers at the market later told me			1
i repeatedly called @entity0 police to check these allegations but the media office refused to give me a reply			1
most of the migrants from @entity23 who were caught apparently were released the next day , as they were all working legally , and police had just neglected to check documents before detaining them			2
it seemed that the raids were more for show than anything else , a bid to show the public that authorities are taking action against illegal immigration			0
once i started my job at the market , i had three options : to become a sweeper , a porter or a vendor			2
i decided to be a porter because it meant more interaction with people			0
i had to find clients on my own , take their luggage and bring it where they wanted			2
i got introduced to an elite porter , @entity124			0
i was shocked to discover he could earn 5,000 - 6,000 rubles ( @entity126 $ 170 ) a day			0
most @entity4 with a higher education do n't earn that much			1
in theory , @entity124 could get up to 150,000 rubles a month ( @entity126 $ 4,500 )			0
the key to his success is that he was one of the first porters at @entity35 when it opened and he built up his own client base			0
it was surprisingly difficult to get a job at the market without connections			2
my supervisor told me that if he had not known @entity72 , he would never have hired me			0
during the interview , i did my best to be a @entity62 , but i spoke @entity62 with a thick @entity4 accent that was hard to disguise			1
i had spent all my 23 years in @entity4 and am considered @entity4			1
fortunately , those 23 years did not give me away			0
i spent about $ 100 on a uniform , a permit and a trolley , then got to work			0
unfortunately , my cover was blown and guards at the market figured out i was a journalist			1
i spent only two days there and earned just 500 rubles ( $ 14 )			0
i would have never thought that working as a simple porter at the market was so competitive and hard			2
but it was harder to find a person willing to pay for the service			0
i was wandering through the aisles , shouting offers of assistance , but nobody responded			0
it was a rough feeling : you 're angry and aching , you feel cold , you want to sleep			0
when i came back empty - handed , @entity72 started laughing at me			0
it was funny for him : a @entity0 with a higher education could not cut it as a porter			1
he told me that it took most migrants several weeks or months to start earning money			2
he said : " i am a @entity4 citizen but nobody hires me because i am @entity62			1
i have a higher education here , but when they ask about my nationality and i answer honestly , they just hang up			0
" it must be said too that people at the market were really courteous to each other while i was there , sweepers , vendors , shoppers , porters , everyone			2
i did n't see anybody fighting or quarrelling			0
i asked about rights violations but @entity72 could n't recall any			0
the security guard worked well , punishing those who violated the market 's rules			2
articles about my experiences appeared in the @entity191 and also in @entity4 reporter magazine			1
the piece was republished in @entity48 and even in the @entity196 press ( lots of @entity196 work in @entity4 as labor workers too )			1
it was the first undercover report from the market which depicted a real migrant 's life by a guy from @entity23 who spent all his life in @entity0			1
while the debate on illegal migration dominated @entity0 , i was able to see the situation from the perspective of the migrants , many of whom end up caught in the crossfire despite being here legally and just struggling to survive like everyone else			1
if it was hard for me , what about the 17 - year - old migrants from @entity23 who do n't speak @entity4 , do n't know anyone , who have no money or support ? perhaps we should think about them when we hear politicians calling for tighter restrictions on immigrants , or see nationalists staging rallies in @entity228			1
the question of illegal migration in @entity0 seems nonsense when the difference between a fake and original work permit is just $ 30			1
it is a question of prejudice			0
unfortunately , a guy from @entity23 is seen the same as illegal migrant , even if he has spent his whole life in @entity4			1
the media sometimes ignites this prejudice			0
according to the @entity4 science magazine @entity243 , for the last 10 years the image of undesirable migrants from @entity23 has been cultivated by journalists as an enemy or an interloper			1
articles about migrants have been written with a negative focus -- crime , fraud , murder			0
migrants were blamed for coming to @entity4 , for taking jobs that " belong " to @entity4 and living in apartments where @entity4 should have lived			1
but migrants themselves are just pieces on a big chess board			0
the @entity4 government needs a cheap workforce of migrants , and @entity48 authorities need @entity4 because there are no jobs at home			1
it 's a question of mutual aid for two countries			0
yet , as long as everybody continues to relate to migrants as mere pawns , the issue will never be resolved			0
the views expressed in this article are @entity276 's alone .			2

journalist @entity276 pretended to be a migrant worker in a @entity0 market
he wanted to see what life was like for @entity62 migrants after tension and violence in the @entity4 *capital* in 2013
@entity276 says @entity4 need migrant workers and migrants need the jobs , so mutual respect is essential
