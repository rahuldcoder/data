@entity5 , if intense rains and strong winds ruin your @entity4 holiday , you will have @entity6 to blame			1
that 's the name of the first named storm of the 2014 @entity10 hurricane season			1
@entity6 is now churning off the coast of eastern @entity12			1
as of 8 p.m. tuesday , the center of @entity6 was stalled about 90 miles east - southeast of @entity14 , @entity12 , and 95 miles north - northwest of @entity15 in the @entity16			1
but @entity6 is n't expected to remain stationary for long , with the @entity17 predicting it will drift northwest before turning north on wednesday			1
the system is expected to go east of northeast @entity12 sometime wednesday , before moving north and possibly affecting the @entity20 of @entity21 on thursday night			1
by then , it may have changed to @entity23 , if it gets stronger , as forecasters expect			0
to reach that status , the storm must have sustained winds of at least 74 mph			2
already on tuesday , parts of eastern @entity12 , from @entity29 to @entity30 , were under a tropical storm watch given the possible combination of powerful winds and heavy rains			1
@entity35 saw sustained winds of 47 mph and a gust of 61 mph on tuesday , according to the @entity38 - based hurricane center			2
such winds may be the least of the worries for the @entity44 island chain , parts of which could end up drenched in 6 inches of rain through wednesday			2
@entity6 is expected to produce significant , but slightly less , rainfall in the @entity47			1
the hurricane center forecast calls for as much as 5 inches through wednesday in @entity12 , with 1 - to 3 - inch totals more likely			1
other parts of the @entity51 also are expected to be affected as the storm churns north			1
@entity54 meteorologist @entity53 said the fact that the @entity20 , a string of barrier islands , is hard to get onto and off of may make the situation difficult for those who are planning to spend their july fourth holiday there			0
the islands are low and rain could easily wash onto the roads , making them impassable even before the eye of the storm makes landfall , he said			2
all preparation for the storm should be done as soon as possible , he stressed			2
on tuesday afternoon @entity54 affiliate @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity21 , was asking its readers to take a survey measuring how concerned they are about @entity6			2
will it make them " batten down the hatches " or be just " another day at the beach , " or does it matter , " as long as it 's gone in time for fireworks " ? there 's also an option for " do n't know / do n't care			0
" @entity84 , the executive director of the @entity85 , said his office has n't received any panicked or alarmed calls from anyone			0
" you take every storm warning seriously , " he said			0
" but , for the most part , folks are n't overly concerned			0
" after hitting the @entity95 , the system is likely to turn northeast , forecasters said			0
by then , it could drench cities like @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , but it 's unclear just how torrential the downpour might be or how it could affect @entity4 festivities , @entity54 's @entity53 said			0
the good news is that none of the current @entity105 forecasts for those three cities are predicting winds in excess of 10 mph through thursday , at least			0
but there is a better than average chance that heavy rain could hit them all			0
here 's a look at what you need to know about @entity4			0

@entity6 is stationary off @entity12 ; expected to head up the coast later
a tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of @entity12 's eastern coast
@entity6 is expected to *strengthen* into a hurricane
