-- if timing is key for musical maestros , @entity1 found out the hard way on the @entity5 slopes that the same is true of @entity6			1
the multi-million selling violinist made her @entity9 bow in the giant slalom tuesday , finishing some 50.10 seconds behind winner @entity11 of @entity12 -- although @entity13 can take heart from crossing the finishing line , unlike 22 other competitors			1
the @entity18 - born @entity17 also made history , becoming @entity21 's first ever female skier and only third representative at the @entity23 , representing her father 's homeland under his surname @entity27			1
her 67th - place finish -- last of all those who actually completed the event -- was not enough to dampen the spirits , though , of somebody more practiced in racing through scales than down the side of a @entity36 mountain			1
" i expected to be last but at the end of the day the @entity23 is a great opportunity , " she told reporters			0
the 35 - year - old , on a slushy course , came hesitantly out of the starting gate , eventually finishing 27 seconds back after her first run and at the rear of the 74 who made it to the bottom out of the 89 - strong starting field			1
her second run saw her clock a total time for the event of three minutes and 26.97 seconds -- 11.35 seconds behind her closest rival @entity53 of @entity54			2
" i nearly crashed three times , but i made it down and that was the main thing , " said @entity1			2
" just the experience of being here is amazing			0
i was worried i was going to get lost [ on the course ] , but i just about managed it			0
" @entity13 , ranked 2,253 in the world , left it late to book her place at the @entity65 -- only claiming the relevant qualifying marks in @entity12 in january			2
the violinist , however , is delighted to have proven to the world that she now has an extra string to her bow , especially considering that this time last year @entity5 had not even been on her radar			1
" i 'm a last - minute kind of girl , i mean training for the @entity23 with six months to go was a last - minute thing , " added @entity13			1
" my main purpose of being here was to really have a good time and to improve my skiing in a very short amount of time			0
" describing music as her " lifelong passion , " but skiing as her " lifelong hobby , " @entity13 made her solo debut with the @entity88 in @entity89 at the age of 10 , three years later becoming the youngest soloist ever to record the @entity93 and @entity94 violin concertos			2
she is now a household name in @entity96 and much of the rest of the world , with global sales in excess of 10 million			0
her self - described " techno - acoustic fusion " is big in @entity12 for one , with tuesday 's giant slalom gold medallist maze -- a part - time singer -- admitting to being a fan			1
" we spoke after the first race , " @entity11 said			0
" i did n't know that it was her sitting next to me			0
" " i respect a lot of what she does with music and she has a great personality , " she said , before adding : " i would n't trade my gold medal for 10 million records sold			0
