-- a detail in the fatal shooting of 14 - year - old @entity3 by a @entity5 officer earlier this month has been stopping me from grieving his death			1
the tragedy happened around 3 a.m. why was a 14 - year - old boy out that late without his mother , @entity11 , who called the shooting an assassination ? or his aunt , @entity13 , who said the bloody gun police say was found near his body was part of a coverup ? where was the supervising adult who should have been with a 14 - year - old boy walking the streets of @entity23 at 3 o'clock in the morning ? " i 'm not saying that he 's the best one , but he 's my angel , " his grieving mother said			1
her " angel " was a suspected gang member who police say was chasing and shooting at an unidentified man when they encountered him			1
her " angel " was arrested last month for attempted murder of a 15 - year - old			1
her " angel " left their apartment around 8 p.m. and she had no idea where he was until the next morning when detectives informed her that her son was dead			1
i want to mourn for her loss , i really do			0
but as callous and as heartless as this sounds , i just ca n't get past what awful parents she and the boy 's father were			1
children may be born angels , but with all the temptations out there in the world , it takes work to try to keep them that way			0
i 'm sure the three teenagers suspected in the death of 23 - year - old @entity55 -- killed because they allegedly were bored -- started off as angels			1
but who , besides their parents , would call them angels now ? " i know my son			1
he 's a good kid , " said @entity63 , the mother of the boy prosecutor @entity64 said pulled the trigger			1
as a newspaper reporter , i covered and was around a fair number of crime scenes involving juvenile delinquents and few things bothered me more than listening to their parents			2
crying , ranting , proclaiming how great their children were despite being kicked out of school or previous run - ins with the law			2
that 's not to say kids wo n't be kids			1
of course they will be			0
which is why it is vitally important that parents be parents			2
so when kids get bored , they do n't think they should go " f * * k with some n * * gers , " as then - 18 - year - old @entity89 suggested before he and his buddies ran over and killed 49 - year - old auto worker @entity89 , the first black person he saw , with his pickup truck back in 2011			1
or randomly shoot a college student jogging down the street as entertainment -- though it seems the shooting may not have been as random as previously thought considering one of the suspects , who is black , tweeted that he hated white people back in april			2
parents are supposed to instill a sense of right and wrong in their children and then keep up the due diligence necessary to make sure they do n't veer off that path			2
when parents do n't do that , we end up with three 15 - year - olds assaulting and breaking the arm of a 13 - year - old on a school bus in @entity115			1
i am sorry what happened to the victim , " @entity117 , whose son @entity118 was one of the boys accused in the attack , said after a court appearance			0
a second appearance is scheduled later this month			0
" it 's just the way it is			2
my son ai n't never been no bad person , he just got mixed with bad people , that 's all ... he sorry			2
" i am not a perfect parent with all the answers			0
but i do know that it was the father , and not the son , who was apologizing -- and that , my friends , is our problem in a nutshell			0
we do n't teach accountability , we do n't expect accountability and i 'm not even sure we even know what accountability looks like anymore			0
some of us have become so addicted to pointing fingers at others for all the wrong that happens in our lives that self - assessment has become synonymous with blaming the victim			2
yes , there are cultural factors that make parenting difficult			0
and sometimes a bad seed is just that			0
but none of this excuses us from taking personal responsibility where we can			0
i am tired of seeing " sorry " being used to cloak negligent parents			0
sorry wo n't bring back @entity55 or @entity89			0
and they , too , were each somebody 's " angel			1
" if sorry is not good enough to protect a bartender who serves alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person who drives and kills someone , why is sorry good enough for parents who , through negligence , are culpable for the crimes their undisciplined children commit ? if my son goes out and breaks the neighbor 's window , i have to pay for it			1
why is a window more sacred than another human life ? we need to hold parents more accountable , both culturally and legally , for the actions of their children			0
maybe then more parents will be more engaged in the lives of their children on the front end , rather than the back end , in front of a judge			0
society has avenues for juveniles who refuse to obey their parents			0
but where are the safeguards for society when parents decide not to use those avenues ? i 'm tired of hearing how good the kids who commit heinous crimes are			1
maybe we should start putting parents on the witness stand so they can tell us exactly what they did to raise such perfect children			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			1

14 - year - old killed by officer at 3 a.m. @entity205 asks , where were the parents ?
@entity212 : police say boy was shooting at others , was arrested before for attempted murder
boy 's mother *insists* he was an " angel . " @entity212 says parents often excuse kids ' crimes
@entity212 : parents should be held responsible for negligence in these cases
