-- " i just get sick and tired , quite frankly , of all this talk			0
everything that has to do with the federal branch of government ... is bad , and states are good			2
i remind you that ... the reason the federal government got into 90 % of the business it got into is that the state [ s ] ... did not do the job			1
" when sen. @entity15 of @entity16 made this statement as a member of the @entity19 in 1981 at the confirmation hearing of @entity22 nominee @entity21 , he was referring to statements by his colleagues suggesting that the judgment of state courts was entitled to greater legitimacy than those of federal courts			2
but @entity15 could well have delivered similar remarks at last week 's @entity31 , where he spoke days after several @entity33 governors , led by @entity35 gov. @entity34 , announced that they will not participate in the health insurance exchanges or @entity38 expansion provisions of the health care law			1
no matter that 25 % of @entity40 are uninsured , reportedly the highest rate among all states			0
@entity34 and the other governors want to burnish their anti-barack @entity45 bona fides to an ever - hungry tea party base			2
these elected leaders are following a longstanding tradition in @entity51 politics of @entity33 acting against the best interest of their residents			1
as @entity15 's 1981 remarks suggest , a good reason the federal government has expanded and occupied areas that might be best served by state government is precisely because of the lack of leadership that has too often been the hallmark of state governments			1
this has been particularly true in the @entity33 , where the idea of state sovereignty and racial injustice often went hand in hand			1
from the @entity70 to the civil rights movement 100 years later , the call for " states ' rights " long stood for the desire of @entity33 states to mistreat their black residents			2
that 's why the invocation of this term -- as it was by @entity79 , when he launched his 1980 presidential campaign in @entity82 , @entity83 -- has become a kind of code that carries offensive racial implications			0
resistance to the federal government -- in particular , the liberal decisions of @entity90 's @entity22 , president @entity92 's @entity91 and @entity94 ' enactment of a series of civil rights laws targeted at discriminatory state conduct -- served as a rallying point for disaffected white @entity33			1
what is most distressing about the elaborate displays of failed leadership by @entity33 governors who rail against the reach of the federal government is their willingness to sacrifice the needs of their most vulnerable			1
the starkest historical example is the 1959 decision of @entity113 , a @entity114 school district , to close schools for five years rather than comply with desegregation orders after @entity117 , crippling the local education system and ensuring that a generation of black students would be unable to complete their k - 12 education			0
the county 's decision followed the lead of @entity114 's powerful senator , @entity125 , who authored the @entity126 , which called for state - based " massive resistance " to school integration			2
to be fair , the phenomenon of bellicose or ineffective state leadership is not limited to the @entity33 or to @entity131			1
only six states initially chose to opt in when @entity38 was first launched back in the 1960s			0
those who chose to ignore @entity38 were merely delaying the inevitable			0
while governors postured , poor women and children fell through the cracks in the health care system			1
ultimately , all states would join @entity38			0
in 2009 , while the country was coping with the effects of the @entity144 and unemployment was high , @entity131 governors from the @entity33 led the call to reject stimulus money for the extension of unemployment benefits			1
but a year later , it was two states in the @entity152 -- @entity153 and @entity154 -- that decided to turn down hundreds of millions of dollars in federal stimulus money for rail projects			0
likewise , legislators in @entity159 have forfeited millions of federal transportation dollars , not to mention tens of millions in saved medical costs , because they do not want to enact a primary mandatory seat belt law , making the state the only one in the country without such a requirement			1
responsibility for failed policies on the state level , however , does not fall solely on the shoulders of elected state leaders			2
voters must also act wisely to adopt the best policies , practices and laws for the common good			0
@entity176 was admonished by the @entity51 @entity22 last year and ordered to reduce the severe overcrowding in its prisons			0
but it was the decision of @entity176 voters to adopt ever more irrational and punitive criminal sentencing laws -- such as " three strikes you 're out " -- that ballooned the state 's prison population and resulted in the @entity22 's intervention			0
this november , @entity176 voters have an opportunity to revise some of the ill - advised " three strikes " sentences			0
the ball is in their court			0
what is desperately needed now in state government is the principled leadership of elected leaders			1
the economy has brought about the most challenging state fiscal crisis in several generations			0
to provide for the needs of its residents -- whether it 's in education , jobs , housing , public safety or health care -- states will have to cooperate with the business and the nonprofit community , but more importantly , with the federal government			1
partisan posturing will benefit only candidates but hurt the common people			0
state government can be the most appropriate locus of government power in many important areas			1
those who argue against the size and reach of the federal government should first demand that state leaders act responsibly and in the best interests of all their residents			1
otherwise , it is the duty of the voters to speak up at the polls			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			2

some @entity33 governors said they will not participate in the health care law
@entity237 : lack of leadership has too often been the hallmark of state governments
she says @entity33 leaders in particular have been resistant to the federal government
@entity232 : what is desperately needed in state government is principled leadership
