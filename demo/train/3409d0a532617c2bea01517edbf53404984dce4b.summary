@entity0 , @entity1 -- i mentor a student who is a senior in a low - performing high school			1
about 50 percent of the students at his school drop out , while less than 25 percent go to college			1
his parents did n't graduate from high school , and his father earns about $ 14,000 a year			2
his grade point average is good enough to qualify him for admission at a few @entity17 schools			2
his parents clearly can not afford to pay his way , so how much debt should he incur to get a college education ? and how many tax dollars should go toward supporting that education ? such questions were on the minds of the thousands of students who demonstrated last week against cuts in public education funding in @entity1			1
as the state government has struggled to balance its budget -- it faces a shortfall of $ 20 billion over the next 18 months after having cut an even greater amount in the past two years -- student fees have continued to rise			1
last fall , @entity17 regents approved a 32 percent fee increase for incoming @entity17 freshmen			2
tuition will be more than $ 10,000 next year			1
the cost of an education at a @entity41 campus or a community college has also jumped significantly			2
the protesting students believe these budget - balancing attempts have harmed public education and made it even more difficult for students such as the one i mentor to get an education			1
i 'm not so sure			0
fifty years ago , when its coffers were flush , @entity1 devised a master plan for higher education that made it possible for anyone who wanted a college degree to obtain one , mostly at taxpayer expense			0
the assumption was that a college degree was not only beneficial for the individual who earned it ( better job prospects ) but also for the state that subsidized it ( an educated work force that would ensure economic growth )			0
fifty years later , the state is broke			0
costs to operate @entity1 's higher education system have sharply risen			0
some critics say this is because university and college administrations are too bloated and enjoy too many perks			1
others , including last week 's student protesters , aim their ire at the legislature and governor for not being more supportive of students and faculty			1
what no one seems to accept , however , is that the whole system is broken			0
@entity1 's taxpayers do n't want to pay higher taxes			1
in the face of less revenue , the legislature will continue to cut the higher - education budget where it can			1
the result : declining enrollments , fewer class offerings , teacher furloughs , staff layoffs and a decline in quality			0
@entity1 's higher - education crisis comes at a critical juncture in its history			1
president @entity101 has repeatedly remarked that the @entity102 is no longer among the top industrialized nations in terms of college participation and graduation rates			0
to reverse the decline , he says the country needs to add 1 million more college graduates a year			0
for @entity1 , that translates into graduating about 100,000 more students a year over the next 10 years			2
but its public education system is projecting a 300,000 - student cutback because of all the budget cuts			1
so , how can @entity1 contribute its share of adding to the number of college graduates ? if voters continue to resist higher taxes , then students fees and tuition will have to continue to go up			1
raising fees to match the real price of a @entity17 or @entity41 education is not necessarily bad if individuals who can not afford to pay for college receive grants and loans			1
anyone who gains a college degree should be willing to accept some debt load , but not so much that he or she is forever burdened			0
the student i mentor will still get grants to attend a @entity17 institution , but his loans are also going to increase			0
he is hesitant , but willing , to accept those debts			0
but how much more should he have to accept ? what seems crazy , however , is keeping the cost of college below market cost			0
that , in effect , gives discounts to those individuals who can afford to pay			2
most individuals , for example , assume that @entity148 and @entity149 are equivalent institutions but the cost of tuition , room and board this year is roughly $ 25,000 at @entity148 and $ 50,000 at @entity149			1
why should someone who can afford the cost of @entity149 get a price reduction for going to school at @entity148 ? californians ca n't have it both ways			1
if they want a system that effectively subsidizes a free college education for all who qualify for one , it needs a tax structure that pays for it			0
if voters are unwilling to raise taxes , then those who can afford to pay for college should , and scarce tax dollars should go to those who would otherwise will be blocked from attending			2
the student i mentor should receive financial help to attend college , and he will benefit from having a college education because he will earn higher earnings			0
the state will also benefit because he will pay higher taxes			2
that is a master plan for the 21st century			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

students have protested increases in public university tuition fees
@entity188 says taxpayers are balking at paying more to finance colleges
he says that means more affluent students will have to pay more
why should fees for well - off students be so much lower at @entity148 than at @entity149 ?
