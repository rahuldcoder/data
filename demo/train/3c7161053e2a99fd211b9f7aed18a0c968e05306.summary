@entity0 -- a federal review cites poor judgment by a security guard who found a bag outside a government building in @entity7 last year and stashed it under a desk where it remained for weeks -- with neither the guard nor anyone else in the building aware that it contained a bomb			1
the report by the @entity16 's office of inspector general released on wednesday also said the guard 's employer , a contractor , and the federal agency that oversees security at the @entity23 shared some responsibility as well for the bomb going undetected			1
" although the @entity27 ( improvised explosive device ) did not explode , it represented a risk to the safety and security of the building and its occupants , " the report said			1
previously on @entity1 : terrorism task force investigates origins of @entity7 package after the bomb was discovered it was detonated harmlessly by @entity7 police			1
a @entity41 man subsequently was charged with placing the device in a canvas bag outside the building			1
the canvas bag , containing a small locked @entity46 safe , was discovered february 26 , 2011 , outside the 27 - story building that houses the @entity48 and other offices and remained at the guard desk until it was identified as a threat three weeks later			1
during that time , at least two employees x-rayed it in an unsuccessful attempt to determine its contents			0
one guard shook it in another failed attempt to learn more , and a federal inspector conducted four routine checks of the guard post without discovering that the bag contained an explosive device , according to the report by the inspector general , an independent watchdog			1
rep. @entity67 of @entity68 , the top @entity69 on the @entity71 - led @entity70 , asked for the audit to determine whether the guard 's actions violated the private security company 's contract with the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , the government entity that protects federal property			1
the assistant inspector general for inspections , @entity79 , concluded the contractor , @entity82 , " committed multiple breaches of its contract " with the @entity77			0
but the report found that the shortcomings " were the result of poor judgment by the guard , not systemic problems with @entity82			1
" @entity93 officials had reason to believe the guard , who was not identified , " should have known how to respond to the bag , " the report said			1
in addition to receiving refresher training just three months before the incident , the guard was a sergeant with the @entity102			2
one fps official asserted that he was one of the best guards in the building , the report said			0
but on the day of the incident , the guard " misidentified the bag as found property and never treated it as suspicious , despite not knowing its contents , " the report said			2
the bag was placed under the security desk in the @entity117 building , where other security guards did not consider it suspicious because the space was used to store found property and personal belongings			2
the @entity77 " also bears some responsibility for the bag ... remaining in the building for 21 days , " the report said			2
an fps inspector did not identify the explosive during four inspections , noting each time that the post was " clean and orderly " and " free of unauthorized items			0
" on march 18 , 2011 -- 21 days after the bag 's discovery -- two guards grew suspicious and screened it			2
when they could not identify the contents , they notified an fps inspector , who determined the bag possibly contained an explosive and took appropriate action , the report said			0
following the incident , @entity82 fired the guard in question			0
previously on @entity1 : guard suspended after suspicious package abandoned in federal building " the guard 's actions were serious breaches that can not be compared easily to other breaches by this company or other guard service companies because there is little precedent , " the report said			1
@entity82 also fired a guard and a supervisor who x-rayed the bag and incorrectly identified its contents			0
a second supervisor resigned before being fired , the report said			0
numerous others were suspended , given written warnings , or retrained , it said			0
both the @entity77 and @entity82 told federal auditors they have taken steps to avoid a similar lapse			0
@entity82 put in place a plan of corrective action and the fps is extending @entity82 's contract in three - month increments			0
it plans to solicit a new contract for guard services in @entity41 .			0

a guard is *singled* out , but the security company , agency also share some responsibility
the device was later detonated harmlessly , but the review says there still was risk for occupants
