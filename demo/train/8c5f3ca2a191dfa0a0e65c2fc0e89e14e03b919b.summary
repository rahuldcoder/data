-- twelve years ago , @entity1 taught the nation about resilience in the face of a massive attack			1
on tuesday , @entity1 again taught the nation that character counts			1
there is , of course , no comparison between the horror of 9/11 and a mayoral primary in @entity13 's largest city			1
but while the shadow of the twin towers still hangs over the hearts of many in @entity1 , the persistence of daily life remains a quiet sign of defiance			1
this year , city politics seemed determined to hit a new low rather than aspire to new heights			0
a series of scandal - scarred candidates sucked up the oxygen amid an otherwise forgettable field			0
and for a while , @entity29 and @entity30 seemed likely to win their respective races on the strength of name id and notoriety			1
if successful , their candidacies could have compounded the cynicism that surrounds politics in an era where too few leaders feel the obligation to hold themselves to a higher standard			0
but when it was discovered that @entity29 had been a recidivist sexter -- under the quintessentially creepy @entity46 " -- something heartening happened : common sense kicked in			1
@entity29 plummeted from first to fourth in the @entity49 primary polls , with much of his support shifting to the aggressively progressive public advocate @entity51 , who rose to pole position aided by powerful ads featuring his biracial son , @entity54 , and a campaign theme focusing on inequality			1
likewise , @entity30 's last - minute entrance into the obscure city comptroller 's race initially injected that campaign with a shot of adrenaline			1
the former state attorney general and governor had derailed a meteoric rise with ill - advised dalliances with hookers during a stormy tenure in @entity69			0
instant infamy was followed by a long slog for redemption , punctuated by a brief tenure as a cable news host on @entity0 and @entity75			0
but the brilliant , ambitious @entity30 was always aiming for a return to political power , and he saw the comptroller 's race as a means to that end , threatening to bigfoot the otherwise pedestrian campaign of mild - mannered policy wonk and career politician @entity84			1
but the self - funded @entity30 was ultimately denied victory , an outcome that largely represented more of a rejection of @entity30 than an endorsement of @entity84			2
on the @entity93 side of the aisle -- in a far less prominent race -- a self - made billionaire grocery magnate named @entity91 essentially tried to buy the @entity93 nomination , encouraged by a cadre of consultants and a handful of high - profile endorsees , many of whom were persuaded to support the man at least in part because of his financial largess			2
a barrage of negative ads directed at his opponent @entity107 -- a @entity109 administration deputy mayor during 9/11 ( whom i served alongside ) and chairman of the @entity112 during @entity113 -- failed			0
in a political world where big money often drives outcomes , this was one campaign where wealth did n't determine the winner			2
that 's a win for representative democracy			0
there is a final hopeful note in this primary election , 12 years after 9/11			1
in the past it has always been a cynical article of faith that winning campaigns were cobbled together by ethnic algebra			0
but this year , @entity1 voters sent the clear , hopeful message that identity politics would not drive their decisions			1
the @entity134 - @entity13 candidate , @entity133 , did not win the black vote			2
the openly gay city council speaker @entity136 did not win the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender vote or the female vote			0
that represents real progress and political evolution toward a more perfect union -- and that is the deeper purpose of our politics			0
twelve years after 9/11 , voter participation still is n't what it should be -- turnout is low in closed partisan primaries , and that represents a creeping complacency where openness and civic energy should be an obligation			0
but in rejecting the sociopathic circus in favor of more sober candidates who tried to build coalitions across old dividing lines , @entity1 sent the message that substance can beat slick self - promotion			1
simply put , character counts			0
and for that timely reminder , it is worth saying again -- thank you @entity1			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			2

@entity171 : @entity1 's primary election sent an *important* message
he says voters chose to reject comeback attempts of @entity29 and @entity30
@entity171 says @entity93 wisely chose not to nominate candidate with the most money
voters also did n't vote *strictly* along ethnic or *demographic* lines , he says
