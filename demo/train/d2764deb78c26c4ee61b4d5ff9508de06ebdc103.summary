@entity0 -- a judge ruled thursday that the @entity4 's developers can not collect billions in damages from companies whose planes were commandeered in the september 11 terrorist attacks			1
@entity9 , or @entity10 , first sued @entity11 , @entity12 and other aviation companies in 2004 , claiming their negligence resulted in the 9/11 terrorist attacks that destroyed the @entity4 towers			1
@entity18 district judge @entity17 agreed with the airlines , who argued the developers were in essence trying to " double dip " by getting money from the airlines after collecting from their insurance policies			1
last month , @entity17 -- who frequently hears cases related to 9/11 -- denied a motion by the airlines to have the case dismissed based on the $ 4.9 billion in insurance payouts to @entity10 since 2001			1
according to a complaint filed on behalf of @entity10 , owned by @entity33 , the september 11 attacks were the result of the airlines ' failures to implement safeguards that would have prevented the terrorist attacks			2
in the complaint , @entity10 claimed that the aircraft lacked proper cockpit doors that would have prevented unauthorized people from entering , as well as an alarm system that would have notified the government of such events			0
@entity45 was the first jet to slam into the @entity4			2
hijackers flew @entity47 into the other tower			0
the lawsuit also named private security contractors at @entity52 's @entity51 and the @entity54 , @entity55 , airport as defendants for failing to prevent people from boarding flights with dangerous weapons at their screening facilities			0
the hijackers of the planes that hit the twin towers boarded at those airports			0
" every step of the way , defendants were negligent and reckless , " the complaint stated , " these breaches of duty proximately caused the destruction of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 on september 11			0
" according to court documents , @entity10 said it has spent more than $ 8 billion to replace the twin towers , which they have been obligated to continue paying rent on to the @entity79 and @entity80			0
in court , the aviation defendants argued that insurance payments were made to compensate @entity10 for economic loss after the destruction of the towers and that the same economic loss is what the @entity10 was seeking damages for , thereby making their claims invalid			1
@entity33 's company had said that it would use proceeds from a ruling in its favor to build 2 @entity4 , next to the current @entity72 .			2

the judge says the @entity4 developers were trying to " double dip "
the developers had sought damages from the airlines *involved* in 9/11
the airlines argued insurance payments had already covered the losses
