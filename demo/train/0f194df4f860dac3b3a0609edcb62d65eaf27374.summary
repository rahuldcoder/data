the first @entity1 war combat veteran to serve in the @entity2 introduced legislation on thursday aimed at reducing the number of military veterans who commit suicide			1
no matter the cost of the measures urged in the sweeping bill , " that is the cost of war , " @entity11 sen. @entity10 of @entity12 told @entity14			1
every day , 22 veterans commit suicide			2
to @entity17 , that is more than a number			1
from 2004 to 2005 , he commanded an infantry battalion of the @entity21 in @entity1			0
when the unit returned home , one of @entity17 's soldiers committed suicide			1
when @entity17 became adjutant general of the @entity21 , a few more guardsmen died by suicide			1
read more at @entity14 's ' @entity29 ' " far too often , we 're leaving our veterans to fight their toughest battles alone , " @entity17 said			1
" returning home from combat does not erase what happened there , and yet red tape and government dysfunction have blocked access to the care that saves lives			2
it is our duty to come together for real solutions for our heroes , " @entity17 told @entity14 on thursday			2
the @entity45 for @entity47 's @entity46 is collaboration between @entity17 and the @entity1 and @entity49			2
founded in 2004 , @entity50 is the first and largest organization for new veterans and their families , with 270,000 members nationwide			2
the next step for @entity17 is to get a co-sponsor for the bill			1
he said he 's already received bipartisan support behind the scenes			0
the veterans organization is working on getting a similar bill in the @entity62 , said @entity50 political director @entity63			2
what 's in the bill ? among the bill 's key objectives is to give veterans more time to receive mental health treatment			1
currently , when a service member separates from active duty -- whether they are transitioning to being a veteran or becoming a reservist or a member of the @entity21 -- they have five years to receive care from the @entity78 , @entity63 said			1
sometimes it can take longer than five years for service members and veterans to realize they 're experiencing the symptoms of @entity83 and other mental injuries			1
read the bill ( @entity86 ) about 25 % of @entity50 's members , @entity63 said , have experienced a delayed onset of ptsd after getting out of the service			2
many times , five years is just not long enough for veterans who are dealing with the stigma of mental health issues			1
it can take many years to emotionally come to grips with the diagnosis alone , and then it takes time to find and receive the right care			1
to address that , @entity17 's bill would extend the time to receive mental health treatment from five years to 15 years			1
watch : veteran talk about long struggle with @entity83 before receiving help the legislation also seeks to improve the quality of mental health care providers by making their jobs more competitive with the private sector , @entity63 said			1
right now there are more than 1,000 open jobs at the va for mental health care jobs , including psychiatric nurses , physician assistants and psychiatrists , among others , she said			1
the bill will introduce a pilot initiative that would allow a student to have their loans repaid if they work for the @entity78 , @entity63 said			2
it also calls for annual reviews of care programs within the @entity127 and the @entity78 to ensure resources are being used effectively to help service members and vets struggling with mental health issues			1
further , the legislation points out that the @entity78 and the @entity127 use two different computer systems and mandates that those systems be amended so that they speak to each other more seamlessly			0
the legislation would also try to streamline the way the @entity127 and the @entity78 prescribe medication			0
currently , they use different drug prescription protocols , @entity17 and military experts told @entity14 , and that can create a difficult situation			1
for example , a service member overcomes the hurdle of admitting they need care , seeks help from a @entity127 doctor and , after several tries , gets on a drug that works for him or her			0
when that warrior become a veteran , they go to a @entity78 doctor only to be told that the drug the @entity127 doctor gave them is not available under @entity78 protocols			0
the bill was introduced the same week that @entity1 and @entity49 held its annual @entity163 initiative			2
teams comprised of four veterans whoses live have been rocked by a fellow warrior 's suicide met with lawmakers in @entity169			0
the veterans shared their stories , and implored those in power to do something substantial to address the problem			0
dollar costs and mental costs it 's unclear how much it would cost to do everything the bill lays out , according to @entity181 , @entity17 's spokeswoman			1
@entity17 is waiting for the @entity182 to provide a figure , she said			2
but the senator stressed that it will cost far more in years to come if changes are not made soon to improve mental health care			1
the legislation comes at a time of fierce belt tightening in the armed forces			2
in february , the @entity127 said it would reduce the size of the @entity193 to @entity195 numbers , retire the a popular a- 10 " @entity197 " attack jet and reduce some benefits for warriors			0
" this is a budget that recognizes the reality of the magnitude of our fiscal challenges , the dangerous world we live in , and the @entity47 military 's unique and indispensable role in the security of this country and in today 's volatile world , " secretary of defense @entity201 said in february			0
" there are difficult decisions ahead , " he said			0
" that is the reality we 're living with			0
" downsizing due to modernization and budget constraints began under @entity222 's predecessor , @entity221			0
the @entity1 and @entity224 wars are the longest continuous battles the @entity47 has fought			0
the @entity1 war lasted from 2003 to 2010 and @entity224 has been raging since soon after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			0
president @entity228 has said that the @entity47 could withdraw all troops from @entity224 by the end of 2014			0
more than 2 million @entity47 have served in combat in those two wars			0
researchers estimate that as many as 300,000 service members may meet criteria for ptsd and between 200,000 and 300,000 have suffered a traumatic brain injury from mild to severe , according to dr. @entity237 with the @entity238			0
the nonprofit think - tank @entity239 estimates a third of veterans likely have @entity242 , ptsd or depression , which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000			0
a large body of research indicates @entity83 is associated with increased likelihood of suicidal behavior			0
beyond the bill @entity17 was sworn into the @entity2 in january after @entity12 gov. @entity250 named @entity17 , his lieutenant governor , to serve the remainder of sen. @entity253 ' term after he became @entity47 ambassador to @entity255			1
@entity17 is running for election in november			2
@entity17 's legislation , @entity50 's @entity63 told @entity14 , has bipartisan support			1
and the goal is to get it passed by @entity260 , far before an election is a concern			0
@entity17 said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members , too			1
the @entity127 is currently not tracking the number of suicides among relatives			0
@entity14 recently explored the topic and spoke to dozens of relatives who said they had contemplated or attempted killing themselves			0
warrior suicides and military family member suicides are " connected , " @entity17 said			1
speaking about a warrior under his command who had been deployed three times whose wife was left to care for triplets , @entity17 said he understood that families have been under extreme stress for years			1
the relatives have made " enormous sacrifices , " he said .			0
