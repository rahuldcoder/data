security and intelligence officers also seized lawyers , activists and journalists who backed the protests , @entity88 said			0
most detainees had been freed in days without charges , and others were released on bail with charges pending			0

@entity182 ordered the release of detainees in the unrest " who have not committed criminal acts against the homeland and citizens , " the @entity34 reported thursday			0

@entity229 , the special rapporteur on torture , called on @entity3 " to respect the physical and mental integrity of protesters , ensure justice and accountability for victims , and bring those responsible for violations to justice , " the @entity17 said in a statement			1
" firing on peaceful crowds attending protests or funerals is by no means justified , " stressed @entity241 , special rapporteur on arbitrary executions , one of 10 independent experts joining the call on the @entity3 government to end the crackdown			1
" live ammunition is being used outside the prescribed limits and in clear violation of international law			0
firearms may only be used in self - defense or in the defense of others			0
" he said the unrest could " easily escalate into widespread violence , " citing reports that people are now arming themselves to retaliate against security			0
