-- on december 11 , 1997 , the world agreed that climate change needed to be tackled			1
the grandly named @entity3 framework on @entity4 adopted the @entity5 on that day , and it was eventually ratified by 191 countries			2
now it 's about to expire with a whimper			2
of the major industrial powers , only the @entity9 is prepared to continue adhering to the @entity13 pact 's provisions on cutting greenhouse gases into 2013			1
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have already said they wo n't			0
the @entity19 never ratified the agreement			0
so attention is turning to devising a " @entity13 2.0			0
" @entity0 special : five cities fighting for climate survival this week , nearly 200 delegations have gathered in @entity26 to plan for a new international climate pact that would come into effect in 2020			1
but there are huge disagreements between developed and developing countries over sharing the burden			1
the @entity13 agreement envisaged binding cuts in emissions by the industrialized world -- but not by rapidly industrializing countries like @entity38 and @entity39			1
they are now the largest and third - largest generator of carbon emissions , respectively , and developing countries account for more than half the world 's emissions , according to the @entity46			1

but @entity38 and the @entity19 were together responsible for more than 40 % of emissions in 2009			2
@entity19 emissions of carbon dioxide have risen by 10.5 % since 1990			2
and @entity38 is heavily reliant on coal -- the most carbon - intensive of fossil fuels -- to drive its economic growth			2
the stakes for the environmental health of the globe and its citizens have gotten a lot higher in the last 15 years , amid widespread crop failures in the @entity65 , changing weather patterns , acidifying oceans and a record ice melt in the @entity69			1
right now , a @entity16 tanker carrying liquefied natural gas is steaming through the @entity69 on its way to @entity17 -- the first such vessel ever to take the route , thanks to thinner ice cover			2

and in a new report , the @entity83 cites the " nearly unanimous " prediction by scientists that the globe will warm by as much as 4 degrees celsius this century			0
it expects the consequences to include " the inundation of coastal cities ; increasing risks for food production potentially leading to higher malnutrition rates ; many dry regions becoming dryer , wet regions wetter			0
" " recent extreme heat waves such as in @entity16 in 2010 are likely to become the new normal			0
... @entity99 , @entity100 , and all tropical islands in the @entity102 are likely to regularly experience heat waves of unprecedented magnitude and duration , " according to the @entity83 study			0
the @entity107 , a @entity3 agency , reported last week that global carbon dioxide emissions had risen by 50 % since 1990			1
there 's fresh evidence that they are still rising , and an overwhelming majority of climate scientists say the warming of the planet is accelerating , with consequences we ca n't predict			1
scientists describe this as the " cascade of uncertainties			0
" read more : @entity123 youth offers hope for @entity125 climate talks the @entity107 calculates that the volume of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has now reached 390.9 parts per million , roughly 40 % higher than the level before the @entity131			1
375 billion tons of carbon have been released into the atmosphere since 1750			0
about half has been absorbed by the oceans and the @entity137 's biosphere ; the rest will remain in the atmosphere for centuries , gradually cooking the planet			1
read more : greenhouse gases reached record highs in 2011 , says @entity3 study the latest data from the @entity107 also shows that emissions of nitrous oxide are 20 % higher than in the preindustrial era , and are accelerating			1
that 's a cause for concern because nitrous oxide is much more " toxic " that carbon dioxide ; its impact on the climate is about 300 times greater			1
about 40 % of the nitrous oxide emitted is from human activity , according to @entity107 estimates			0
there are glimmers of renewed interest in climate change			2
president @entity165 , in his victory speech on the night of the election , said he wanted to " pass on a country that is n't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet			0
" the @entity9 has already cut in its emissions by one - fifth , compared with 1990 , and is considering extending that to 30 % by 2020			1
a @entity3 program is encouraging small - scale projects that address warming at the local level			1
one such project is in the sprawling @entity39 city of @entity177 , where a fleet of buses running on compressed natural gas is reducing air pollution			0
in a city of 7 million , one - fifth of commuters have jumped off their motorcycles and scooters and onto the buses			2

three years ago , at the abortive climate talks in @entity195 , @entity196 , rich countries promised the poor they would raise $ 100 billion by 2020 to help them cope with climate change			1
budget pressures in developed countries make that target look very distant now			1
nongovernmental organizations like @entity202 are lobbying for new taxes on the aviation and shipping industries to help raise the money			0
they contrast the rapid recovery in the @entity19 from the effects of @entity210 with the disastrous consequences from the same storm for @entity213 , where up to 2 million people may face malnutrition after crops were washed away			0
the notion of shared sacrifice is not one familiar to climate talks			2
@entity38 never tires of pointing out that while it is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide , its emissions per capita are still far lower than those of the @entity19 but that may not be for long : last year alone , they rose 9 %			2
the danger , according to multiple scientific studies , is that without a redoubling of efforts to curb emissions , the goal enshrined in @entity13 , @entity17 , of restraining warming to 2 degrees celsius this century , compared with the preindustrial era , will soon be unattainable			0
right now , the goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees by 2100 seems like a pipe dream			0
if emissions continue their current path , the target will be breached within two decades			0

the vast majority of glaciers in @entity249 are retreating ; river flows are decreasing throughout @entity251 and @entity249			0
" by the late 21st century , @entity255 plant species are projected to shift several hundred kilometers to the north , forests are likely to contract in the south and expand in the north , and about half of the mountain plant species may face extinction , " the @entity252 says			0
farmers in the @entity19 @entity263 have just endured the worst drought in 50 years ; the bread baskets of @entity266 and @entity16 have similarly shriveled in the face of intense heat			0
technologies exist that will allow humanity to make a rapid dent on emissions			0
renewable energy accounts for double the amount of power it did just six years ago			0
carbon sinks deep underground can capture and store emissions from gas flaring			0
better vehicle emissions standards , reforestation and a developed carbon trading market would all help			1
there are all sorts of green gestures at the 18th meeting of the @entity3 framework on @entity4 in @entity26 , one of the world 's highest emitters of carbon dioxide per capita			1
examples are " paperless " documentation and buses run on natural gas to ferry delegates to the conference center , which is partly powered by solar panels			0
but the political will required of 194 delegations to bring the world closer to a new climate pact is yet to be tested .			1

nearly 200 delegations have gathered in @entity26 to plan for a new international climate pact
developed , developing countries disagree over how to share burden of cutting emissions
@entity137 is seeing crop failures , new weather patterns , record ice melt , acidifying oceans
there 's doubt that at the global level , emissions - cutting goals will be matched by deeds
