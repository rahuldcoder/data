-- the surgeon who performed heart surgery wednesday on former first lady @entity3 said thursday that she is recovering well from the 2 1/2 - hour surgery in which her aortic valve was replaced with a pig valve			1
former first lady @entity3 had heart surgery wednesday in @entity8 , @entity9			1
" from our perspective , this was a very routine procedure , and we expect her to make an excellent recovery , " dr. @entity10 told reporters at @entity12 in @entity8			1
@entity17 had experienced " severe narrowing of the main valve that lets the blood come out of the heart into the circulation , " @entity10 said			1
" this valve , instead of being a soft , flexible structure that opens and closes , breaks down , " he said , adding that calcium deposits cause it to stiffen , which can result in fluid in the lungs and progressive deterioration			1
he said an echocardiogram showed her condition was " extremely severe			1
" typical symptoms of problems with an aortic valve include shortness of breath , fatigue , weakness and swelling , he said			1
though his patient is 83 , " she 's a very fit lady , " which helped make the operation a " relatively straightforward " procedure , " he said			1
diagnosed with the condition less than a week before the surgery , @entity17 entered the operating room at 7 a.m. and , after an hour of preparation during which lines were attached to her and anesthesia was administered , the main work began , @entity10 said			1
in all , she was on a heart - lung machine for 55 minutes ; the implantation of the valve took 45 minutes , he said			1
she required no blood transfusion			2
@entity17 was back in the intensive care unit by 10:45 a.m. , where she awoke " quicker than most " patients of her age , he said			2
he described her as " very lucid			2
" " she recognized all of us immediately and actually started tearing us up with some humorous comments just as soon as we took that tube out			0
" he predicted she would remain in the @entity68 until friday or saturday , and then be transferred to a standard hospital floor for another five to seven days			1
but already , he said , she is " walking around the room a little bit			0
" @entity17 's husband of 64 years , former president @entity17 , visited her shortly after the operation			1
" i 've been a nervous wreck about it , " said the former president , who said he had received telephone calls of support from president @entity77 and all the other surviving former presidents			0
" i think there is a lot of interest because of who she is , " he said , his voice cracking			0
i just came from her room and she 's doing well			2
i keep saying , ' you look great			0
' [ she says ] ' do n't tell me that			0
' but you know , she does ... she looks well to me -- and beautiful			0
" @entity17 added , " she 's in command			2
she 's in control of our whole family			2
" asked to describe what occurred between the two when he saw her , he said , " i do n't remember any words			0
i 'm not the anecdotal one in the family			0
it was just a reunion of two people who love each other			0
" afterward , the former president turned to a hospital administrator and said , " i 'm sorry i get emotional , but i ca n't help it			0
" the @entity17 family matriarch is the mother of former president @entity107 and former @entity109 gov. @entity108 .			0
