-- thieves have forced the closure of @entity5 ' @entity4 museum			1
but an art heist was not the reason			0
instead , the closure came after staff walked off the job on wednesday in protest against the increasing number of pickpockets operating in the museum			1
according to a report in @entity16 , the pickpockets work in organized gangs and are targeting both tourists and museum staff with " increasingly violent tactics , " including spitting and kicking			1
despite increased co-operation with the police and temporary bans on offenders , pickpocketing remains a growing problem for the museum , staff said			2
the @entity4 's press department was unavailable for comment early thursday but a representative of the museum said the @entity4 was " open as normal , until 5.30 p.m. " when pressed about yesterday 's events , the representative declined to comment further and ended the call			1
the @entity4 also closed in 2009 and 2001 as a result of staff protests about industrial disputes and working hours			2
the protest will be a pressing challenge for new director @entity42 as he takes up the post this coming monday , taking over from @entity44			0
the museum , home to famous works from masters such as @entity49 , is the most visited museum in the world with around 10 million visitors last year			0
visitors should be mindful of their belongings when at the @entity4 ; @entity55 's eyes may not be the only things following you around the room			0
the @entity4 is open every day ( except tuesday ) from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. night opening until 9:45 p.m. on wednesdays and fridays			0
