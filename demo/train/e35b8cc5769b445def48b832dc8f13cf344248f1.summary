" he rewrote the history of the entertainment industry in his time , " @entity8 said			1
@entity2 crossed color lines and broke down barriers between musical genres			1
he followed in the footsteps of @entity27 and the @entity28 to create a transnational fan base that prefigured the era of globalization			1
and @entity2 became a canny power broker who helped lead artists from stage performers into major boardroom players			1

" @entity2 transcended race before @entity43 , before @entity44 , before @entity45 , before @entity46			2
" you ca n't underestimate what his did for black artists -- and artists as a whole -- as a business man , " @entity36 added			0
his 1982 album " @entity54 " has sold more than 50 million records worldwide -- a record that , considering the decline of record sales in the wake of new media , is likely to stand for some years to come			0
" records just do n't sell that much anymore			0
... now it 's in shambles because of technology , " said @entity63 , head of the @entity64 and a former correspondent for @entity66			0

" what he did was so cutting - edge regarding videos ; he defined the video age as we know it , " said @entity89 , who succeeded @entity79 as head of @entity81			0
though his personal finances were in disarray at the end of his life , @entity2 made some canny business decisions at the height of his power -- most notably buying half the @entity28 music catalog in 1985 for $ 47.5 million			1
" when you look at his royalties and his copyrights , he 's probably got a half a billion to a billion ( dollar ) catalogue , " @entity36 added			2
the current value of his estate is unclear			0
his debts stood at about $ 500 million , according to a @entity113 story earlier this month			1

future business plans included a world tour , a @entity134 musical and even a " @entity54 " casino			0
" you are talking about a guy who could make $ 500 million a year if he puts his mind to it , " @entity124 told the @entity136 in an article last month			1
