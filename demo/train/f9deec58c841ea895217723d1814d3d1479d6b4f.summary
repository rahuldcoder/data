the cabin caught fire during a shootout and standoff with police , who also fired tear gas			0

" well , it could n't have turned out better for the @entity5 , they definitely did n't want @entity10 in court			1
heads would have rolled if @entity10 would have been taken in alive somewhere , " said a posting by @entity98			2
public fascination with and endorsement of an anti-hero is common in history and the arts , especially when the figure advances a political message that resonates with people , experts said			2

" do n't get me wrong			0
what he did was awful			0
killing innocent people is bad			0
" but when you read his manifesto , when you read the message he left , he was n't entirely crazy			0
he had a plan and mission here , and many people are n't rooting for him to kill innocent people , they 're rooting for somebody who was wronged to get a kind of revenge against the system			0
" it is almost like watching ' @entity132 ' in real life			2
" fueling @entity10 's folk - hero status is social media 's iconoclastic tone , said @entity138 host @entity137			1

it 's also home to fans of @entity146 , the man charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 more in a @entity149 cinema in july , he added			2
" there is some part of it that is social media weirdness , " @entity137 continued			1
the narrative of @entity10 " resembles a @entity156 movie where someone is wronged , and he stands up for himself and goes down in a blaze of glory , " he said			2
opinion : do n't focus on @entity10 's politics films are steeped in lore of the little guy raging against injustice , sometimes based on historical figures such as @entity167 , @entity168 and the @entity169 , and @entity170 and @entity171 , said @entity172 , a retired professor of @entity174 and media studies at the @entity175 in @entity176			1
fictional or historical , the characters are often portrayed as latter - day @entity183 , victims of oppression or the everyman brutalized by an economy or authority , @entity172 said			0
" @entity174 have always been fascinated with outlaws , going back to early movies , @entity187 and things like that , " @entity172 said			0
" you always root for the underdog because of a sense of rebellion			0
" we sympathize with them because very often , people do feel they are tied down to rules and regulations and do n't have autonomy , and people say , ' i 'm going to disregard this , and i 'm going to do what i want to do , ' " @entity172 added			0

@entity223 police also fired upon another blue pickup the same day , but no one was injured in that incident , a law enforcement source said			0

manhunt : a car chase , a gunfight and a fiery cabin " it certainly does n't help a police department that has a history of what looks like brutality , and then they act in a way that looks rash and unthinking on tv , " @entity251 added			0
on a talk radio station in the @entity266 - @entity174 community in @entity0 , some residents " were lionizing and admiring @entity10 , " said civil rights attorney @entity263			1
@entity268 has sued the @entity5 for racism on behalf of more than 100 minority officers , an experience that she described as " hand - to - hand combat			1
