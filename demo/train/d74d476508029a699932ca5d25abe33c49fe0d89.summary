-- the four @entity2 staffers recently held captive for about a week by @entity4 troops made it out of @entity6 alive			1
however , they 're unsure if their driver , @entity7 , did			1
and the experience is forcing the seasoned war journalists to reconsider how they look at the world			1
" we probably should have died those first 12 hours , given , you know , the intensity of the firefight and the positions we were in , " @entity11 told @entity12 on @entity0 's " @entity13			2
" but when @entity11 and his colleagues @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 emerged unscathed from the firefight , they fled right into the arms of their soon - to - be captors , who were manning a government checkpoint			2
@entity7 got out of their vehicle at the checkpoint			2
the journalists , who were blindfolded soon thereafter , are n't sure if they ever saw him again , but suspect the worst			1
@entity20 recalled , " i looked over , and i saw our car , and one of the doors was open , and there was a guy taking out stuff and putting it on the sidewalk			1
and i looked down and next to the driver 's side was a man , face down with one arm outstretched , and he clearly was n't moving			1
and my initial thought was , ' it 's @entity7			2
' but i do n't -- i did n't see his face , and it 's hard to say , because we do n't know			2
you know , there was so much chaos after the car was stopped			2
" @entity22 said @entity7 was about 21 years old and a great driver			1
" we 've been checking the jails , the hospitals , morgues , everything , " @entity22 said			2
" and still , nothing has come forward			2
and you know , this is all weighing very heavily on all of us ... we feel this huge responsibility			1
" @entity11 recently wrote in the @entity2 that , " if he died , we will have to bear the burden for the rest of our lives			2
and an innocent man died because of us , because of the wrong choices that we made for an article that was never worth dying for			1
no article is , but we were too blind to admit that			0
" when @entity12 asked him about that quote , @entity11 responded , " i think the full impact of that burden is -- i mean , it 's certainly starting to dawn on me			0
you know , why did n't i leave earlier ? you know , why did i stay as long as i did			0
you know , you hope that you -- you 're doing it , because that story would n't have been told otherwise			1
but even if that story would n't have been told otherwise , it was n't worth someone 's life			1
" @entity21 said that the same gambles that can pay off with information for journalists can also put lives at risk			1
@entity22 said that can cause psychological stress for loved ones			0
" it was really quite emotional , " he said			0
" there are three days that my family , for example , did n't know if i was dead or alive			0
you know , that 's a lot , a lot to put your family through and everyone else that you knew			0
" @entity20 says the psychological trauma she endured at the hands of her kidnappers has changed the way she sees people and prisoners			1
" i 've photographed prisoners with the hoods on and their hands bound , and i 've never thought about what it feels like to be completely removed of all of your senses			1
i mean , it never dawned on me			0
not that i 'm insensitive , but i just -- because it 's never happened to me before , " she said			0
" you have to dehumanize somebody , i think , before you can be violent , " @entity11 added			0
ultimately , the journalists ' shared humanity helped them pull through			1
" there were moments when i was -- i could n't stop crying			0
and i felt so weak and i -- and i tried to sort of muffle it			0
and i was trying not to cry , " @entity20 remembers			0
" inevitably , one of [ my colleagues ] was sitting next to me and would say , ' there are people who love you			0
we 're going to get out of this			0
you just have to get there , ' you know			0
and so it 's very helpful to have colleagues with you			0
i mean , we were so lucky that we were together			0

the journalists believe their @entity6 driver may have been killed by @entity158 forces
they feel ' a huge responsibility ' for the missing driver
the journalists have been *reassessing* how much risk is worth taking to get a story
they say they realize how dehumanization of prisoners can lead to violence
