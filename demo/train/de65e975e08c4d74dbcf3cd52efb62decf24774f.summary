@entity0 -- @entity3 vice-presidential hopeful and conservative star @entity2 kicks back with locally brewed beers while listening to ' 90s - era grunge music			1
he 's the first member of @entity6 to be named to a major party ticket			1
@entity2 's up - by - your - bootstraps personality does n't exactly match the ennui expressed by the grunge bands of his youth -- he was voted " biggest brown - noser " in high school , after all			1
but his economic and political perspectives , like those of many of his generation , were formed in part by the fiscally conservative @entity21 principles of his childhood and the stark realities of entering a post-college job market during the 1990s recession and dot - com boom and bust			1
" gen @entity28 were supposed to be the lost generation			0
( that label ) shaped him because he went back to the principles of hard work to get ahead , " said @entity30 , a former @entity33 administration economic policy analyst who has been friends with @entity2 for nearly 20 years			1
in his pairing with baby boomer @entity40 , the 42 - year - old @entity2 brings a conservative gen @entity43 's fiscal approach to the ticket , political experts say			1
for example , @entity2 's controversial " @entity52 " entitlement reform plan , which proposes a partially privatized @entity47 program for future seniors , takes a cue from gen x and gen y concerns that these programs will run out of funds long before @entity55 and @entity56 will be able to participate			1
" there are plenty of young people who do not believe @entity47 and @entity61 are going to be there , and that 's part of the logic why @entity2 is trying to reform these things and make sure they are available for future generations , " said @entity57 , communications director for the @entity58			2
@entity2 's conservative stance extends beyond fiscal policy it is a proposal that @entity40 has not fully embraced			1
his campaign told surrogates in a talking points memo obtained by @entity1 on saturday : " gov. @entity40 applauds @entity2 for going in the right direction with his budget , and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance			1
" still , @entity2 's history - making ascension to the ticket does suggest that the @entity3 is turning a page in leadership			1
" this is a young generation of leadership coming forward , " said @entity85 , an associate professor of political science at @entity87 in @entity88 who has studied post-civil rights era politicians			0
passing the torch requires that both generations of the party 's leadership agree to disagree on social policy , she said			1
" a lot of young @entity3 do n't agree with the party on a lot of social issues so they emphasize the fiscal stuff , " @entity85 said			2
@entity2 opposes same - sex marriage and , as a devout @entity102 , once described himself as " pro-life as a person gets			2
" however , in 2007 , he voted for the @entity105 , banning workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation			0
a @entity108 conducted last month of nearly 3,000 adults found that support for allowing same - sex marriage has increased among @entity6 from 44 % in 2008 to 52 % this year			2
" @entity2 is a bridge between , generationally speaking , " said @entity112 , anchor of @entity114 's " @entity113 " at the @entity115 , a conservative news site owned by @entity117			2
@entity2 " voted for banning workplace discrimination based on sexual discrimination			2
that 's a reflection in part of the gen x sensibility			0
we 've grown up with gay men and women being out of the closet			0
... it 's not as shocking as it is for boomers			0
" @entity2 's college years @entity2 's tepid support for environmental programs also seems to dovetail with @entity135 ' views on the matter			1
according to a recent @entity138 survey of 3,000 adults , just 5 % of gen @entity28 said they are " alarmed " and 18 % said they are " concerned " about climate change			0
most of the group surveyed last year , or 66 % , said they 're unsure if global warming is happening , and 10 % said they do n't believe it 's occurring			0
those generational differences could help sway voters turned off by the @entity3 's messaging on social issues such as abortion , but who are open to @entity3 stances on necessary budget cuts			0
then there 's the visual appeal of @entity2 , who is the same age as one of @entity40 's sons			1
when @entity2 stands on stage , flanked by his young children and wife , next to the @entity163 , the older man looks warmer and more paternal , @entity85 said			0
" @entity40 is extremely stiff ... because he still has this persona where it hard for him to feel relatable			0
to have someone who is young and dynamic helps soften @entity40 up and attracts that ' it ' factor and ' wow ' factor , " @entity85 said			2
" @entity2 would seem to be cooler			0
even talking about the fact that he listens to @entity173 and grunge			0
... the fact that he says he likes hard rock makes him seem cooler			0
... that charisma is born in youth			0
" what do you think of @entity40 naming @entity2 as his running mate ? let us know on @entity183 .			1

@entity2 is the first member of @entity6 named to top of a major party ticket
he came of age during an economic recession and the dot - com boom and bust
his views on economy and social policy have gen @entity6 influences , political experts say
@entity2 's relative youth helps @entity40 's appeal
