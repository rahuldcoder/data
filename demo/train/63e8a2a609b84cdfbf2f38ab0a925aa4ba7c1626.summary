@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday defeated an impassioned legislative push to reduce the growing problem of sex assault in the armed forces by overhauling the way the military prosecutes serious crimes			1
by a vote of 55 to 45 , a bill championed by sen. @entity11 failed to get the 60 votes needed for passage			1
the measure would have removed military commanders from deciding whether most serious allegations of wrongdoing by their subordinates should be prosecuted			1
the responsibility would have been shifted to prosecutors outside the chain of command			0
@entity11 , a @entity25 @entity24 , said the change was needed because bias can creep into the decisions of commanders and that has led to many sex assaults not being prosecuted			1
" it 's time to move the sole decision - making power over whether serious crimes akin to a felony go to trial from the chain of command into the hands of non-biased , professionally trained military prosecutors where it belongs , " @entity11 argued			1
she pointed to a @entity42 report as evidence			0
the recent study showed that there were estimated to be 26,000 incidents of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012 and just over 10 percent of those were reported			0
officer who trains sex crimes prosecutors accused of groping lawyer while @entity11 's reforms had significant support in the @entity2 , they were opposed by the bipartisan leaders of the @entity57 and the @entity42			1
opponents cited concerns it would undermine the critical military principle of command authority			2
" the strongest most effective approach we can take to reduce sexual assault is to hold commanders accountable for establishing and maintaining a command climate that does not tolerate sexual assault , " said sen. @entity63 , a @entity64 @entity24 who chairs the armed services panel			2
" the evidence shows that removing this authority from our commanders would weaken not strengthen our response to this urgent problem , " he said			0
sen. @entity78 , a @entity79 @entity24 , led the effort to defeat @entity11 's bill			1
the former prosecutor pointed to several significant reforms that became law last year she said would increase prosecutions of sex assault			2
they include : removing the authority of commanders to overturn convictions ; providing attorneys to victims ; making it a crime to retaliate against a victim ; and requiring a dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault			0
@entity78 warned that removing commanders from the process could leave victims more vulnerable to retaliation			0
@entity11 and @entity78 , two rising @entity104 senators , have battled intensely for months over how best to reform the prosecution process			2
on a separate vote thursday , a bill authored by @entity78 to make additional reforms to those adopted last year cleared a procedural hurdle in the @entity2 , clearing the way for expected final passage			1
it would largely disallow the so - called " good soldier " defense , which permits defendants to enter evidence of their good military character at trial to mitigate the charges against them			0
it moved ahead easily with the support of @entity11 .			0
