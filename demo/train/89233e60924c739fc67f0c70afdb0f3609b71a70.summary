-- as scores of people head to the @entity5 this week commemorating 50 years since the march on @entity6 , some corners of the media are still featuring passionate debate over whether african - americans have ignored " a culture of violence " in their midst			0
the finger pointing this time comes after the senseless killing of @entity16 baseball player and college student @entity14 , shot dead august 16 while jogging on a street in @entity18 , @entity19			2
from the moment three teenagers were arrested in the crime -- first misidentified as three black youths , later found to be two african - americans and one white guy -- some media outlets tried to draw comparisons to the killing last year of black teenager @entity28 by neighborhood watch captain @entity29			1
but if @entity14 's death has anything in common with @entity28 's -- besides the sad fact that both killings seemed avoidable and were possibly committed by people of a different race from the victim 's -- it 's the sometimes sloppy reporting used to make points about race that deserve subtler , more precise treatment			1
random killings spark laments , but reality shows long slide in crime in the early days of reporting on @entity28 's death , @entity29 was identified as white because police in @entity47 , @entity48 , listed him that way on the incident report			1
those early reports about a white man killing an unarmed black teen fit an easy black - and - white narrative about racial profiling in @entity56 , while the truth was that @entity29 identified as @entity58 , but still could have profiled @entity28			1
similarly , @entity0 aired a report suggesting that @entity29 might have used a racial slur to describe @entity28 during his 911 call to police just before the shooting			1
but later , @entity0 aired another story with a different audio analyst who disputed that conclusion , and no allegations of a racial slur on the call surfaced at his trial			2
@entity72 : negligent parents , lawbreaking kids this past week , @entity77 's " @entity76 " and the @entity79 website both reported the three teens who killed @entity14 were black			2
the @entity79 also published a photo featuring a different , dark - skinned black youth identified as @entity82 , the white teenager police believe drove the car during the shooting			0
both outlets also criticized president @entity87 and activists such as the rev. @entity89 for not making an issue of @entity14 's death in the way they spoke on @entity28 's killing			1
the mistake with @entity82 ' photo recalls a similar error made as some media outlets began publishing material reportedly discovered on @entity28 's closed social media accounts , in an attempt to show he was n't the innocent teen his family and supporters described			2
both @entity106 and @entity107 published photos of a shirtless , young black man facing the camera and providing a middle finger salute with both hands , identifying him as @entity28			2
that person was not the dead teen @entity28 , but a different young black man			0
about a year later , @entity29 's defense team released images taken from @entity28 's cellphone which did show him shirtless , making a similar gesture to the camera , but it 's tough to know what that revealed other than a teen with a typical rebellious streak			1
still , an unspoken argument seems to be wrapped up in these stories			0
it 's the conflict over institutional prejudice and racism			0
in the @entity28 case , police knew who killed the teen and resisted arresting him for 44 days			0
that fueled concerns that laws such as @entity48 's stand your ground legislation were making it easier to profile and kill @entity141			0
that seems a long way from a presumed thrill killing in which suspects were arrested within days , saying they shot @entity14 because they were " bored			0
" teen arrested in beating death of @entity152 vet even news that one of the teens involved in @entity14 's murder posted anti-white statements on @entity158 months ago seems a different point			1
but some media outlets , committed to the idea that @entity56 institutions such as the criminal justice system are mostly fair , have focused on more personal explanations for such tragedies , emphasizing the criminality of some black people in ways that evoke old stereotypes about people of color and crime			0
it seems obvious that real - life incidents rarely fit neat categories and the need to explain senseless deaths can lead to a lot of jumped - to conclusions			1
but if the @entity182 and @entity28 cases teach anything , it 's that cherry - picking facts to fit a preconceived narrative can be a road to inaccuracy and unfairness			1
here 's hoping somebody is taking time to soak up the lesson			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity193 : @entity14 , @entity28 killings being compared to make points about race
races of some in both cases were *misreported* , false images posted *online*
@entity193 : the errors fit into preconceived racial notions when real story is more complex
@entity209 - picking facts , jumping to conclusions *inflames* more hatred , he writes
