-- the plot details are still super-secret , but there 's at least one thing that fans of " @entity5 " can count on when @entity6 and her crew return to the big screen next week : a visual feast of outrageous , over-the - top fashion			1
to celebrate the arrival of the hotly anticipated sequel , @entity0 sat down with series costume designers @entity13 , @entity15 and @entity16 -- as well as our very own fashion director @entity17 -- to compile a list of ms. @entity21 's greatest hits			1
# 1 : the @entity22 @entity6 does @entity23 ! according to @entity15 , " @entity24 was always very inspired " by the @entity27 impressionist 's paintings of dancers , " and there were many moments when she captured that			1
" this pale pink tutu , originally purchased for $ 5 and then reproduced by the series ' skilled seamstresses " because , " @entity15 said , " we knew it was going to get wet , " was first spotted in the series ' title sequence			1
when @entity6 tried it on again in the first film ( while cleaning out her closet ) it was still the most iconic -- and literal -- interpretation of the ballerina look			1
@entity6 's best looks ever # 2 : @entity13 's favorite asked to identify her favorite piece , @entity46 did n't hesitate to name the drop - dead @entity49 gown @entity6 wore while waiting ( and waiting ) for @entity50 on her first night in @entity51 , towards the end of season 6			1
" it took you out of reality , " she said			0
@entity17 agreed : " it 's acres and acres of tulle and chiffon , in this darkly romantic color -- the perfect dress to be dumped in			0
there 's nothing more woeful than seeing a beautiful woman all dressed up with nowhere to go			0
" # 3 : the @entity67 - @entity66 @entity6 chose this @entity69 number for a post-breakup meeting with @entity71 at the @entity72 in the season 3 finale			2
" that was a moment where it was either happening , or it was n't ; either he loves her , or he does n't			0
they did n't get back together -- that time -- but do n't blame the dress : " this is vintage @entity6 , " @entity17 said			2
# 4 : the @entity80 " one day , i had to take the train , " @entity15 recalled , " and i saw all these @entity84 girls wearing nameplate necklaces			2
" from there , a trend was born			0
" we wanted to establish things that the audience would associate with @entity6 , " @entity15 explained			1
" finding those familiar pieces was a big part of our success			0
" " @entity5 " character transformations : @entity6 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 # 5 : @entity98 " this is a fun combination of high and low , " @entity17 said , referring to @entity6 's season 5 ensemble , which included a sweater from mall staple @entity102 , a dress by department store favorite @entity105 and a @entity108 jacket			1
added @entity15 : " i love the color ! " # 6 : the fashion statement @entity46 did n't mind revealing that @entity6 will revisit past favorites , like this @entity113 newsprint dress , in the new movie			1
" there 's a reason for it , " she hinted			0
" she has an experience that merits re-wearing it			0
" is the original context -- she donned this dress in season 3 , when she apologized to @entity122 for her affair with @entity71 -- a clue ? # 7 : runway - @entity125 by the time @entity6 was preparing to marry @entity128 in the first movie , she ( and the " @entity5 " costume designers ) had no trouble securing super-current styles , like this @entity133 runway look			2
" everyone wanted their clothes on the show , " @entity15 said			2
" boxes and boxes would arrive daily			0
" @entity140 : " which " @entity144 " character 's closet would you most like to raid ? " # 8 : @entity6 's @entity145 " the oversized corsage is iconic @entity6 , " @entity16 said			1
and it 's very @entity24 , too : @entity15 reported that @entity148 was " really into " her character 's signature accessory			1
" they started small , and one day she said , ' let 's do a big flower , ' and then they got larger and larger until it escalated into a comedy of flowers ! " # 9 : @entity158 " these were costumes , not clothes , " noted @entity17			0
" you ca n't forget that			0
they have to telegraph the mood of the scene			0
" case in point : @entity6 's @entity169 striped @entity170 from season 6			1
" i would n't love this on the streets of @entity174 , but she 's in @entity51 , so she 's wearing classic @entity51 knitwear			2
it 's perfection ! " " @entity5 " style secrets from the set # 10 : show - stopping shoes the ruffled , rose louboutins that @entity6 chose for her goodbye to @entity71 at the end of season 4 were only one pair in a long line of truly stunning stilettos ( good thing , too , as they were wrecked when @entity96 's water broke all over them )			2
@entity6 spent , by her own reckoning , tens of thousands of dollars on shoes over the course of the series , but @entity15 insisted that it was writer / director @entity195 who turned many a shoe designer into household names			1
" he was the one who said , ' let 's talk about @entity200			0
" " if you look at " @entity5 " as @entity202 , " @entity17 cautioned , " you 're missing the point			0
this is fashion to the max ! " indeed , for many fans , the clothes are a crucial part of the drama			0
moviegoers are eager to discover whether sparks fly when @entity6 runs into old flame @entity212 in the new flick , of course , but many are arguably even more excited to see what she 's wearing when -- and if -- she does			2
