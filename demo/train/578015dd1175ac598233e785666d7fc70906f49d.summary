-- stringent restrictions remain in place monday on about 100 soldiers at a large military base in @entity5 after the theft of " sensitive " and valuable " military - grade " equipment			1
members of the @entity10 are at @entity11 trying to find out who is responsible for the missing items , said maj. @entity14 , a spokesman for the @entity16 's @entity15 that is headquartered at the base and includes the affected unit			1
" hundreds of items " are missing from a vault that is inside a building on the base , the spokesman said			1
they include things such as scopes and night - vision goggles but no guns or ammunition			1
" there are no weapons , and there 's no danger to the public , " @entity14 said			0
after learning of the thefts , the @entity16 decided on wednesday to put members of the @entity16 's @entity36 , @entity37 on lockdown , preventing soldiers from making phone calls or leaving the unit 's barracks or unit office			0
the unit has been home from @entity46 since september 2010			0
these measures were relaxed somewhat on saturday , with some supervised visits allowed on a case - by - case basis to deal with personal issues and permission granted to eat at the base 's dining facility			1
division members , who live either on or off the base , still must sleep at the barracks			0
there is no timetable as to when all the restrictions will be lifted , @entity14 said , adding that decision will depend on the investigation			0
" ( this will ) go on as long as we can gain information about the person or persons involved in the theft , " said @entity14 , noting no timetable has been set for when the restrictions will be lifted			1
" this is being taken seriously , so ( the military ) can get back the equipment that taxpayers paid for			0
" military officials did their monthly inventory of the vault in december			0
they then did another after the holiday vacation and determined that " large amounts " of items were missing -- " immediately " precipitating the lockdown , said @entity14			2
a $ 10,000 reward has been offered by the @entity16 in the case			1
he explained that every unit has its own vault , which in this case has two locks -- one on the vault , and another on the door to an abutting office			2
it has not been determined whether the missing items were stored properly or if someone was able to get into a properly locked vault and made off with the equipment			1
" there are a zillion possibilities , " @entity14 said of what might have happened			0
the missing items could all " be bought on the civilian market , just one or two generations older , " the spokesman said			2
he added that they have limited use to the public , given the challenges in knowing how to use them and having the right kind of weapon to attach them to			0
the restrictions on the soldiers affect only a fraction of those at the expansive @entity11 , as none of the other roughly 50,000 people on the grounds about 13 miles southwest of @entity116 are directly affected .			2
