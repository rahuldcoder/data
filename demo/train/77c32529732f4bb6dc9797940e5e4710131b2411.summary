@entity0 has been criticized in a damning @entity2 report into @entity4 's handling of bribery allegations which only came to light after a sports marketing company that the world football governing body worked with went bust			1
the report , which will be debated by the council 's @entity11 wednesday , said it would be " difficult to imagine " that the @entity4 president body would have been unaware of " significant sums " paid to unnamed @entity4 officials by @entity18 / @entity17 in connection with lucrative contracts for @entity22 television rights			1
the @entity2 published testimony on its website , supplied to them by @entity26 , the @entity27 prosecutor in a court case investigating the 2001 bankruptcy and collapse of @entity17			2
@entity26 said bribes worth at least 12.7 million @entity27 francs ( $ 14 million ) were paid to a @entity33 @entity4 member , known as " person @entity34 , " while another 1.5 million @entity36 ( $ 1.65 million ) went to another senior @entity4 official , identified only as " person @entity38 , " to secure the rights			0
the @entity2 covering report by @entity43 national assembly member @entity42 singles out @entity0 for his part in the affair , although making no allegations of involvement in corruption			1
it states : " mr. @entity0 was technical director of @entity4 from 1975 to 1981 , @entity4 general secretary from 1981 to 1998 and has been its president ever since			2
since @entity4 was aware of significant sums paid to certain of its officials , it is difficult to imagine that mr. @entity0 would not have known about this			2
@entity0 rejects @entity2 's call for @entity4 election probe " that does not mean he was directly involved in this case of backhanders			1
but i believe it is extraordinary he did nothing to make public all the information which @entity4 had or has , and took no steps whether internally or via the courts to enable @entity4 to obtain reparation			1
" the money paid under the counter to certain unscrupulous officials should have been paid to @entity4			0
" @entity42 's report concluded by highlighting remarks made by @entity0 in answer to a question by @entity76 's @entity75 at a press conference in @entity78 , @entity79 on march 9 over calls for an investigation into his re-election as @entity4 president			1
@entity0 was quoted as saying : " we need , naturally , also the acceptance of the political authorities -- but we do n't like political authorities interfering in our internal affairs			0
" @entity42 responded : " the independence of sport -- to which we remain committed -- should not become a defense for those who abuse their authority			0
it is wrong to have accusations without proof , but it is our duty to ask for the truth to be sought and established			0
" the money managed by @entity4 is money that belongs to football and not to its officials , but in addition no sports organization can become a place where the law does not apply and where corruption and fraud are in practice tolerated and go unpunished			0
what is at issue here is compliance with the rule of law			0
" @entity4 gave its reaction to the report in an emailed statement to @entity76 : " @entity4 has already made its position very clear on the report and on the @entity122 closing order ( @entity4 has repeatedly said it would like the closing order to be published ) , and will not make any further comment for the time being			1
" last month @entity4 's executive committee announced plans for a new two - tier ethics committee -- one to investigate corruption , the other to rule on the cases			0
it acted after corruption allegations in both last year 's presidential race , won unopposed by @entity0 , and the bidding process for the 2018 and @entity135			2
@entity0 was the only candidate for a fourth term of office after @entity138 , president of the @entity139 , was suspended over bribery allegations and eventually banned for life by @entity4			1
the @entity2 report will be considered by over 300 parliamentarians from the @entity145 member states in @entity146			2
the @entity2 was founded in 1949 to foster co-operation between @entity149 states with particular reference to democracy , legal judgments and human rights .			0
