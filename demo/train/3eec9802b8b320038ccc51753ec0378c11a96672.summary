it was billed as the day 's marquee primary battle , but in the end it was an easy night for @entity4			1
the five - term senator from @entity6 -- who 's the top @entity7 in the chamber -- defeated tea party - backed challenger @entity9 in tuesday 's primary			1
in tuesday 's other high - profile race , two @entity7 candidates in @entity13 will face a july runoff for the @entity16 , @entity18 projects			1

@entity9 conceded , telling supporters that he had spoken with @entity19			0
that conversation was confirmed by aides to the incumbent			0
in his concession speech , @entity9 did n't back @entity19 , but he said he has no intention " of supporting the @entity31 platform over the @entity7 platform			1
" but @entity9 appeared critical of @entity19 and the groups that supported him , saying " the attacks that we have been on the receiving end of have made our opposition smaller people			0
it has cheapened their accomplishments and it has weakened the foundation of their platform			0
" @entity19 praised @entity9 and made a pitch for reconciliation			0
" @entity9 brought a lot of passion and tenacity to this race and he made me a stronger candidate			0
a tough race is behind , it 's time to unite			1
to my opponent 's supporters , i hope you 'll join me in the months ahead and know that your fight is my fight , " @entity19 said			1
how @entity19 crushed the tea party @entity6 was one of six states holding primaries on tuesday and again , anti-establishment candidates faced long odds in high - profile @entity7 showdowns			1
in @entity13 , @entity18 projects @entity66 will win the @entity31 @entity16 primary , taking another step toward following in the footsteps of her father , @entity70			1
on the @entity7 side , businessman @entity72 led the pack with 30 % of the vote -- well below the 50 % a candidate must get in order to avoid a runoff , according to numbers complied by @entity21			1
@entity72 will face off against rep. @entity80 , who came in second with just under 27 % of the vote			1
the winner of the july runoff will go on to face @entity70 in november to fill the seat of retiring @entity7 sen. @entity86			1
in @entity89 , @entity18 projects sen. @entity88 has won the @entity31 primary , and pediatric neurosurgeon @entity91 is the projected winner of the @entity7 @entity16 primary			1
the two will face off in the general election in november			2
and in @entity98 , @entity18 projects rep. @entity97 has won the @entity7 primary in the state 's 2nd @entity100 , turning back a challenge from tea party candidate @entity103			1
5 key primaries to watch tuesday while his primary battle ended up easier than originally expected , @entity19 now faces a much tougher test against @entity6 secretary of state @entity108			1
@entity18 projected that @entity108 would win her primary			1
a rising @entity31 star , she faced no real opposition in her primary and already has had big names -- such as former president @entity113 -- team up with her on the campaign trail			2
speaking to supporters who held up signs that read " @entity119 needs @entity108 " and " @entity6 needs @entity4 , " the @entity16 majority leader tied his @entity31 challenger to president @entity119 and to senate majority leader @entity121			1
" my opponent is in this race because @entity119 and @entity121 want her to be in this race , " said @entity19 , adding that " a vote for my opponent is a vote for @entity127 and the president who sold it to us on a mountain of lies			0
" @entity108 , who spoke at her victory celebration just minutes after @entity19 's speech ended , quickly fired back			2
" i 'm here to tell you tonight , my fellow @entity136 , i am not an empty dress , i am not a rubber stamp and i am not a cheerleader			0
i am a strong , @entity6 woman who is an independent thinker who , when i 'm @entity6 's next senator , the decisions i make will be what 's best for the people of the @entity6 , not partisan interests , " @entity108 declared			2
and she highlighted where she does n't see eye - to - eye with @entity119			0
" i do n't agree with the president 's war on coal			2
i think it 's wrong for @entity6 , " @entity108 said			2
@entity108 connected to big donors , big hitters @entity9 , a businessman from @entity154 , announced his primary challenge last summer , and quickly gained the support of tea party activists and some influential @entity159 - based anti-establishment groups			2
the race between the two men quickly turned ugly , and expensive , as both campaigns and outside groups spent big bucks			0
anti-establishment @entity7 felt that @entity19 represented everything wrong in @entity159 and thought he could be knocked off			1
the @entity168 fund dished out $ 1 million in support of @entity9 and against @entity19			0
but the group recently became very quiet , with @entity19 's formidable lead in the public opinion polls			2
large campaign war chest but @entity19 had a large campaign war chest , as well as the backing from two @entity6 - based super pacs , and such powerful national groups as the @entity179 @entity178 and the @entity180			0
and @entity19 ended his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from @entity6 's other @entity7 senator , @entity184 , the one - time upstart who beat @entity19 's pick in the 2010 @entity7 @entity16 primary in @entity6			1
but the two quickly mended fences , and @entity184 , who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians , backed @entity19 last year before @entity9 got into the race			0
@entity184 congratulated @entity19 in a tweet			0
the narrator in one of @entity19 's two closing statewide tv commercials says , " on tuesday , join with @entity184 and vote for @entity4			1
" and the spot includes a clip of @entity184 saying last year that @entity6 " ought to be proud of having senator @entity19			0
" earlier this year @entity19 predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right , saying , " i think we are going to crush them everywhere			2
" @entity19 told the @entity203 that when it came to tea party challenges , " i do n't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country			0
" his prediction might come true , as @entity19 's defeat of @entity9 was the latest in a string of victories for incumbent and more moderate @entity7 over candidates backed by tea party activists and other grassroots and anti-establishment groups			1
soon after the race in @entity6 was called for @entity19 , two of the groups backing @entity9 closed ranks behind the @entity16 minority leader			1
" now it 's time for @entity7 to unite for victory in november , " said a statement from the @entity223			1
and the @entity226 released a statement saying , " we congratulate @entity19 on winning the primary			2
we ask all republicans to come together to defeat extremist @entity230 liberal @entity108 this fall			0
" now it 's on to november 's midterm elections , where @entity31 -- who hold a 55 - 45 majority in the chamber ( including two independents who caucus with the party -- are defending 21 of the 36 seats in play , with half of those @entity31 - held seats in red or purple states			1
key races to watch the only states where the @entity31 currently hope to play offense are @entity6 and @entity13			1
if the @entity7 flips six @entity31 held seats , they 'll will win control of the chamber , and @entity19 will get a promotion from minority leader to majority leader			1
@entity19 made a pitch for that promotion in his victory speech , saying " we can take the reins of power away from @entity121 and make this president accountable			0
make me the majority leader and @entity6 will lead @entity179			0
" a big question right now is whether @entity9 and his supporters will rally around @entity19 , or if they sit it out come november			0
in 2010 , after @entity184 topped @entity19 - backed candidate @entity266 , the minority leader was quick to bring all sides together at a unity rally			0
the battle ahead the faceoff in @entity6 should continue to be heated , and expensive			0
when all 's said and done , the race could become the most expensive @entity16 campaign in history , breaking the $ 82 million record set in the 2012 @entity16 battle in @entity277			1
@entity108 , 35 , is using classic campaign strategy against the 72 - year - old longtime incumbent : it 's time for change			2
" we 've had 30 years of failed leadership under @entity4 ; we can not afford six more , " @entity108 declared emphatically to a packed house at her campaign headquarters here in @entity154 on monday			0
to counter that , @entity19 is using a standard strategy for a longtime incumbent			0
he is trying to paint his seniority as a plus and warn @entity136 about the perils of a junior senator with little clout in @entity159 representing them instead of a potential @entity16 majority leader			1
" my opponent , i certainly agree , is a new face , but a new face for what ? new face for the status quo			2
same majority leader , same agenda , no change at all			0
a new face for no change at all , " @entity19 argues on the stump			2
but @entity108 ' full - throated assault on @entity19 goes beyond a call for change			0
she is using @entity19 's @entity7 leader status and his frequent moves to block legislation to make him the symbol of gridlock in @entity159			1
like republicans all over the country , @entity19 is trying hard to make this election a referendum on president @entity119 , who lost @entity6 big in 2012 and is highly unpopular now			0
" do we want to go in a different direction , or do we want @entity121 to continue to be the majority leader ? do we want a vote for @entity119 in a state that he carried four out of 120 countries ? that 's what 's really at stake in the fall election , " @entity19 told @entity18 monday			1
and the @entity334 outside group @entity333 said they would spend nearly $ 600,000 starting wednesday to run a television commercial that ties @entity108 to the president			0
the problem for @entity19 is that he too has a high unfavorable ratings back home , and @entity31 here are hoping that will be his ultimate downfall			0
the most recent polling indicates the two candidates are all tied up in the november showdown .			0
