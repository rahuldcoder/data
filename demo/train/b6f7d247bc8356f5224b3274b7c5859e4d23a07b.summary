@entity0 -- gov. @entity3 's office said monday that the nurse quarantined at a @entity6 hospital is being allowed to transfer to @entity7 , the latest development in a medical and political saga regarding possible cases of @entity11 in the @entity12 , and how politicians in charge are responding			1
a battle of words broke out during the weekend between @entity17 , who returned home from @entity11 - ravaged @entity19 only to be ordered into quarantine , and the @entity22 governor			1
the nurse told @entity1 that her " basic human rights have been violated " and that @entity3 himself was responsible			2
@entity17 will be transported by a private carrier , " not via mass transit or commercial aircraft , " read the statement , which was blasted out by @entity3 's office			1
gov. @entity31 said in a statement @entity7 will work with @entity17 " to establish an in - home quarantine protocol to ensure there is no direct contact with other @entity36 until the period for potential infection has passed			2
" @entity39 , an attorney for @entity17 , told @entity1 's @entity40 her first priority is to get out of the hospital and back to a normal life			0
@entity39 argued " there is a legal basis to challenge " the @entity6 policy , but " whether she wants to do it remains to be seen			2
" while in @entity50 campaigning for @entity51 gov. @entity51 , @entity3 stood by @entity6 's quarantine policy			1
" i know she did n't want to be there			0
no one ever wants to be in the hospital , i suspect , and so i understand that , " he told reporters			0
" but the fact is i have a much greater , bigger responsibility to the people and the public , and so i think when she has time to reflect she will understand that as well			0
" @entity17 was the first medical professional to be quarantined in @entity6 immediately upon returning to the @entity12 from @entity19 , where she had worked in treating @entity11 patients			1
she lashed out at @entity3 during the weekend for giving her a diagnosis of sorts as " obviously ill. " " first of all , i do n't think he 's a doctor ; secondly , he 's never laid eyes on me ; and thirdly , i 've been asymptomatic since i 've been here , " @entity17 told @entity1 's @entity70 in a phone interview sunday			2
" there always needs to be a balance , because i also want to be treated with compassion and humanity , " @entity17 said on @entity1 's " @entity75 " by phone from her hospital isolation			0
" i do n't feel like i have been treated that way in the past three days			0
" mandatory quarantines : now what ? in an off - camera interview with @entity1 senior medical correspondent @entity86 , @entity17 added , " i am not , as he said ' obviously ill. ' i am completely healthy and with no symptoms			0
and if he knew anything about @entity11 he would know that asymptomatic people are not infectious			0
" the @entity92 seemed to agree with @entity17 's sentiment that @entity3 does n't have the medical authority to impose regulations that trump federal guidelines on handling @entity11 patients			1
a senior administration official told @entity1 on sunday that the @entity92 informed @entity3 and @entity100 gov. @entity99 -- who also ordered quarantine for people returning to his state from @entity19 -- along with other state officials that it " has concerns with the unintended consequences of policies that are not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat @entity11 at its source in @entity19			1
