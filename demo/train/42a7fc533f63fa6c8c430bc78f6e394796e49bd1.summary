@entity2 prime minister @entity1 's timing was impeccable : july 1 marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of @entity6 's @entity5 , the de-fanged fighting force that has protected the country since its creation from the ashes of @entity6			1
following the announcement , it is also the day that , some would argue , the name ceased to have any meaning			0
@entity1 's government , mindful of looming regional security threats to @entity6 and its neighbors , has allowed the " reinterpretation " of the country 's pacifist postwar constitution to reflect what he sees as necessary pivots to meet the 21st century security challenges that the nation faces			1
@entity1 's @entity27 has approved a defense policy that takes a liberal view of the constitution , allowing for @entity2 involvement in the defense of its allies			1
previously , the @entity5 could only act if @entity6 itself was directly threatened			2
@entity1 , speaking at a press conference tuesday			0
said that the " basic idea " of the constitution " remains unchanged , " and that any involvement in military action must be taken in a " minimal way			2
" he said that @entity6 's security policy has evolved throughout the postwar period , and that the @entity5 activities in peacekeeping missions are appreciated around the world			1
with the reinterpretation , " @entity6 will contribute even more than in the past			2
" with regional concerns , such as @entity50 's missile program and @entity52 's increasing belligerence in regional territorial claims occupying the prime minister 's mind , he will see a more relaxed interpretation of the document as critical to maintaining @entity6 's influence , both within the @entity60 sphere but also internationally			1
" our peace is not something given by others , " @entity1 said			0
" we ourselves must establish peace			0
there is no other way			0
" the move paves the way for @entity6 to send @entity5 troops , ships and aircraft to support @entity75 military activities in conflict areas and to join internationally sanctioned security activities , putting @entity6 in line with many of its key allies , including the @entity75 , which has long supported this			2
the @entity75 " welcomed " the reinterpretation , @entity83 deputy spokesperson @entity82 said			0
" the @entity75 - @entity6 alliance is one of our most important partnerships , security partnerships , and we value efforts by @entity6 to strengthen that security cooperation , and also value @entity6 's efforts to maintain openness and transparency throughout this decision - making process that 's led up to this new policy			1
" @entity1 's proposal will end the ban on " collective self defense " and make it easier for @entity2 troops to be deployed overseas to aid in the protection of allies			2
before @entity1 's statement , the constitution 's famed @entity104 9 expressly disallowed military solutions as a defining principle			2
" the @entity2 people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes , " an excerpt reads			0
until today , the interpretation was that @entity6 can use its military force only to protect itself from external attack			2
since its inclusion in the constitution in 1946 , no @entity2 military personnel have been engaged in combat overseas , although troops have been sent to countries like @entity128 for peacekeeping and reconstruction purposes			1
and many in @entity6 are unwilling to see the hallowed article go without a fight			0
before the announcement , thousands of protesters thronged the pavement outside the prime minister 's office and official residence , demanding that @entity1 step back from the decision to reinterpret the constitution			1
over the weekend one man set himself on fire outside the busy , city center @entity143 in apparent protest			0
polls are divided over the move , which was hastily -- and some say incompletely -- debated			0
but one thing is not in doubt ; that there remain swathes of the @entity2 public who oppose this move			2
@entity155 , @entity6 's chief cabinet secretary , said the coalition is " confident that a majority of the public support the use of the right of collective defense in limited condition			1
" " in reality we need to set up legal framework ( to exercise the collective defense ) and we need to debate in the @entity166			0
i believe we can earn the understanding of the public			0
" @entity6 's relationship with its neighbors , particularly key trading partners @entity172 and @entity52 , has never been hugely cordial , but is currently at a particularly low ebb			1
@entity1 's visit to the @entity175 , which honors @entity6 's war dead -- including war criminals -- and the ongoing debate over responsibility for comfort women , means that for the prime minister to show his hawkish side may risk even further deterioration of @entity60 relations			1
the @entity52 government bristled at the implication that it was @entity52 's expansionism that was motivating @entity1 's move to a more reactive stance			0
" we are opposed to @entity6 's pursuit of its domestic political goal by deliberately making up the so - called ' @entity52 threat , ' " @entity192 spokesperson @entity191 said ahead of @entity1 's announcement			1
he also noted that the government were pursuing the change in interpretation despite widespread public opposition			0
" it is the general public of @entity6 that should have the final say on which way @entity6 should follow in terms of national development			0
" @entity52 's state - run @entity208 also warned of the pitfalls of trashing the pacifist wording of the document , saying that the move essentially amounts to an " upgrade " of @entity6 's @entity5 to " a national military ... brutally violating the spirit of @entity6 's current ( pacifist ) constitution			1
" @entity172 warned @entity6 off operating without the @entity217 's consent in matters that directly affect the country 's soverignty , and said that it would " continue to keep a close eye on relevant developments , " according to a @entity192 spokesperson			1
the @entity225 official also used the occasion to emphasize the impact of @entity6 's wartime actions and successive governments ' denial of responsibility on regional harmony			1
" in terms of defense and security issues , the @entity2 government should renounce historical revisionism and take right actions in order to dispel doubts and concerns stemming from historical issues and to win the trust from its neighboring countries			0
