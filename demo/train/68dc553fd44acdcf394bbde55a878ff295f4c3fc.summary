@entity0 a @entity3 politician behind a controversial anti-gay propaganda law has been caught up in a social media storm in which he is pictured in a photograph of two women kissing			1
@entity9 was on an @entity11 flight from @entity0 to @entity12 when he was photographed by two women who took a selfie of themselves kissing in front of him			1
@entity9 was the driving force behind a law that bans " propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors			1
" as a lawmaker with the ruling @entity23 party , he ensured the legislation was first passed in his home city of @entity12 before it was adopted across the country			0
in the past , he has called lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people " sick " and " crazy			2
" spotting him on their flight , the two lesbian activists kissed , took a selfie and uploaded it to @entity34			1
@entity35 , one of the women in the photo , posted on her @entity39 ( @entity3 's version of @entity40 ) that " as fate would have it , he was sitting in the row behind us			1
" she went on to say , " @entity9 did n't say anything			1
we did a photoshoot with him in the background			0
when he noticed what we were doing he hid behind his tablet computer			0
but who cares ! " @entity52 told @entity1 that she was " delighted by the positive global reaction " to the photo after it went viral on @entity53 and was " liked " by more than 1,000 people on @entity34			2
@entity9 lashed out at the photographer , saying " i am tolerant towards all sexual minorities			1
" he went on to say : " this shows that these people are not of a normal sexual orientation , but that their sexual deviance shows in all aspects of their lives			2
i did n't understand what they are doing but they have a nice sense of humor			0
i also have a good sense of humor			0
i will perhaps continue this joke by closing their gay club in @entity12 , or ban them from having meetings in public places , that 's also a funny step			0
" @entity9 is currently working on legislation that would ban marriages in @entity3 between transgender couples			1
it comes after two people were able to get married in wedding dresses in @entity12 last year because one of them , according to passport information , is a man			0
at the time , @entity9 told @entity1 that he was working to get the marriage annulled and that the people who allowed it to take place were " psychologically sick			2
" he suggested that @entity93 and @entity94 should be committed to a " mental asylum " and that gay people who want to get married " should go to the @entity96			0
