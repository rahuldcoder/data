-- most @entity1 do n't want the @entity1 to launch military strikes against the @entity4 government			1
a recent @entity7 / @entity6 poll says 59 % of the @entity1 people oppose such an intervention , while 36 % support it			1
even more oppose supplying weapons to the @entity4 rebels , with 70 % against and 27 % in favor			1
many have welcomed president @entity15 's move to bring the decision before @entity17 as giving the issue the kind of national debate it deserves			2
and hearings this week may move the needle of public opinion to give the president more confidence that he has the backing of @entity1 voters			1
but even if that does n't happen , the president needs to move ahead with the plan to punish the regime of @entity31 for the use of chemical weapons in an attack outside @entity35 -- to degrade its ability to use such weapons of mass destruction in the future and to force its removal and replacement by opposition forces that we support			2
such action does not have to involve @entity1 boots on the ground			2
it should not involve putting @entity1 lives at risk			2
but what it will require is a kind of leadership , clarity and commitment that has been sorely lacking from our @entity4 policy to date			1
while leadership often entails persuading others to follow before taking action , sometimes it requires taking action even when it is unpopular because it is the right thing to do			0
opinion : @entity17 , support @entity15 on @entity4 in fact , setting foreign policy by opinion poll is among the most dangerous traps for a political leader			1
by nature voters are disinclined to take risks and to intervene in distant conflicts			0
given the outcome of the @entity76 and @entity77 wars , you can hardly blame them			0
in addition , citizens , even earnest ones , are often reluctant -- and sometimes ill - equipped -- to weigh seriously how the outcome of such conflicts might affect @entity1 's long - term national security interests			1
that is not a slam on those citizens			0
often the issues involved are arcane , convoluted and mind - bending , even to so - called experts			0
presidents need to take these things into consideration when evaluating just how much weight to give to public opinion			0
furthermore , whereas presidents are elected by the people , they are sworn to do what they can not only to preserve , protect and defend the @entity96 but also to execute the duties of their office			0
this means serving as commander in chief of the armed forces , guiding @entity1 foreign policy and working with the tools given to them by elected representatives , such as the @entity107 , which grants them the authority to take military action without consulting with @entity17 if they deem it essential			1
( they have to consult @entity17 within 60 days			0
although it is worth noting that presidents often undertake such action not by drawing on the power granted them under the act but by that conferred to them under @entity118 , section 2 of the @entity96			0
that 's the section giving them the responsibility for being commander in chief			0
) the critical issue is whether the national interests of the @entity1 are at risk and must be protected			1
in the case of @entity4 , it is clear that the president must act			1
opinion : @entity15 's irony , @entity133 's agony the administration has said @entity31 has used chemical weapons			2
this is an abuse of international law and norms that can not be allowed to stand , or it will send a message to other bad actors -- some of whom represent a direct threat to @entity1 soldiers , private citizens and allies , as is the case in the @entity149 , to choose one example			1
( @entity157 's @entity156 threat to allies such as @entity159 , @entity1 friends in the @entity152 and @entity1 military forces in the region is yet another			2
) further , if the @entity1 does not act after the president had rightly declared such action would be unacceptable , it would undermine deeply and perhaps irreparably our credibility in the @entity164 and worldwide			1
just as important , the @entity31 regime is an ally of @entity157 's , seeking to advance @entity157 power throughout the region and doing so with direct @entity157 aid and weapons support			0
this is a threat to our allies , to regional stability and , by extension , to the global economy and vital energy supplies			0
further , the deterioration in @entity4 has made the country a breeding ground for a new generation of extremists who might be empowered by an @entity31 defeat			2
we must be careful to place our support behind others , such as the @entity184 , who are most likely to be sympathetic to our views			0
but we almost recognize that not stabilizing the @entity4 crisis , simply ignoring it , will make the situation throughout the region much more dangerous			1
we must send a clear message chemical weapons use is unacceptable			0
and we must actively support the opposition with weapons so that they can defeat @entity31			0
even if the regime that replaces him is hostile to us , it is unlikely to pose the kind of regional threat that one supported by @entity157 does			0
outcomes may not be exactly what we seek			0
action may be dangerous and unpopular , but inaction is certain to make the situation worse and the threats to our interests grow			1
opinion : @entity212 should n't bail out @entity15 's floundering foreign policy the president deserves credit for trying to make this case to the @entity1 people			1
but it is time for him to act whether there is broad support for him or not			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : polls say @entity1 averse to @entity4 strike and welcome hearings
he says basing foreign policy on polls dangerous for a leader who must protect @entity1 interests
he says citizens often do n't see implications of inaction
@entity223 : @entity15 has authority and cause to act whether there is broad support for him or not
