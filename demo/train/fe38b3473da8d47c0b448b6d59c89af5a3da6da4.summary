@entity0 -- most people travel to @entity3 to look at antiquities			1
but i 've spent the last few days in @entity0 sightseeing the country 's digital future			1
and what i 've seen is surprisingly encouraging			1
the future is n't hard to excavate in @entity3			1
indeed , immediately upon arrival at @entity12 , travelers are confronted by spread of slick advertisements for a global bank			0
" the future is full of opportunity			0
be part of the future , " one of these advertisements advises			0
" age will be no barrier to ambition , " another promises			0
" even the smallest business will be multinational , " a third guarantees			0
but today , in a @entity3 wracked by the most serious economic crisis for at least a century , the truth about the country 's economic future is mostly the opposite of these advertisements			1
in @entity3 today , the future is mostly characterized by fear rather than opportunity			1
the problem is that this small country does n't appear to be part of anyone 's " future			1
" increasingly peripheral , even to the euro crisis , @entity3 is in danger of drifting back into its dark 20th century past : back to the self - destructive politics of anti-capitalist violence and ethnic hatred ; back perhaps to the drachma , to economic autarky and perhaps even to a financial apocalypse equivalent to the @entity46			1
@entity50 crisis : in - depth in @entity3 , the " smallest businesses " in an economy still dependent mostly on tourism , are about as multinational as the crumbling remains of the @entity54			1
in this classic @entity62 @entity61 gerontocracy in which at least 50 % of young people are unemployed , age actually mostly represents an impenetrable barrier to ambition			0
and yet , amidst all the despair , there is a rebirth going on in @entity3			1
it 's a digital renaissance and it 's being pioneered by a new generation of talented young @entity72 entrepreneurs who are trying to reinvent not only the @entity3 economy and society , but also @entity3 's role in today 's global economy			1
the irony of this nascent @entity3 digital renaissance is that it probably would n't have happened without the economic crisis			1
in pre-crisis @entity3 , most @entity3 grew up wanting to be public servants			2
but now that the old clientist state can not offer lifetime sinecures for university graduates , young @entity3 coming out of university now have little else to do except invest their labor in start - ups			2
" there 's no other option , " @entity88 , the founder of @entity89 who splits his time between @entity91 and @entity0 , told me about this entrepreneurial renaissance in @entity3			1
" people of my generation recognize this			0
" @entity99 , the ceo of @entity100 who studied physics at @entity102 and who now divides his time between @entity0 and @entity105 , agrees with @entity88			0
given the crisis , @entity99 -- a young man who is already on his third start - up -- believe that young @entity3 have " nothing to lose " and are " willing to take a risk			1
" there 's a " big opportunity " in @entity3 , @entity99 told me because -- given the relative insignificance of the local market - start - ups have to be global , both in their organization and their market			2
@entity100 , for example , which offers big brands tools for mobile marketing , has its biggest client in @entity122 and , of its 22 fulltime staff , four are in the @entity124 , six in @entity61 and 12 in @entity0			0
in the @entity3 digital economy , even the smallest business have to be multinational			2
@entity61 's leaders are spinning plates @entity129 concurs with @entity130			0
@entity129 , a 28 - year - old woman who has degrees in economics and real - estate development from @entity135 and @entity136 universities , came back from the @entity124 to @entity3 to start - up and run @entity138 , an @entity140 app designed as a virtual closet for young fashionistas which already has 40,000 users			2
people said i was " crazy " to come back to @entity3 , @entity129 , who returned to @entity0 to live with her parents , told me			2
" but it was a great decision , " she explained , because digital is " booming " in @entity3 and it 's an ideal market to " think global and act local			1
" like @entity99 and @entity88 , @entity129 's confidence in the digital @entity3 rebirth is rooted in the wealth of human talent in @entity3			1
i think they are correct			0
having spent the last few days in the invigorating company of many @entity3 start - up entrepreneurs , i have been struck with their vitality , intelligence and ambition			2
from early - stage collaborative workspaces like @entity165 and 123p , to entrepreneurs from promising local start - ups like @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , it is self - evident that there is something very promising brewing in this nascent @entity3 digital economy			2
so what could go wrong with this budding digital @entity3 renaissance ? the biggest problem , of course , remains the oppressively bureaucratic @entity3 state that , in spite of the crisis , continues to be a major obstacle to entrepreneurial innovation			1
" failure in @entity3 in penalized , " @entity99 told me about a system in which entrepreneurs can end up in jail if they bankrupt their companies			0
and every @entity3 start - up entrepreneur i met complained bitterly about arcane and ever - changing bureaucratic regulations that make setting up and running a company frustratingly complex and time - consuming			0
@entity3 pull money out of country 's banks as @entity200 , the co-founder of @entity165 told me , @entity3 remains a " tough environment " for entrepreneurs			2
what 's missing , @entity200 explained , is a both a legal and social acceptance of the idea of failure			0
there 's no " culture of forgiveness " for business failure in @entity3 , @entity200 explained			2
and thus most @entity3 remains terrified of failing , even though failure is the unavoidable norm of even the most successful start - up ecosystem			0
then there 's the broader cultural challenge of rewiring @entity3 minds for the digital age			1
as @entity100 ceo @entity99 explained , most @entity3 -- even its younger generation -- do n't " get " the idea that @entity3 , if it wants to compete in the 21st century global economy , has any other option but to become a start - up nation like @entity224			1
oddly enough , a possible @entity3 exit from the euro is seen by many entrepreneurs as a much a blessing in disguise for their businesses as a catastrophe			0
" if you sell abroad you will get rich overnight , " @entity232 , the cto of @entity172 , told me			0
while @entity165 co-founder @entity200 acknowledges that any start - up with clients overseas would benefit from the inevitable devaluation of the local currency that a @entity3 exit from the euro would trigger			0
but does @entity3 economic failure really equal entrepreneurial success ? no , it 's not that simple			1
@entity200 cautions that the return of the drachma would be " superbly negative " for entrepreneurs in the short - term , with exchange controls , massive layoffs , riots and empty supermarket shelves			0
@entity99 even warns that a euro exit might result in significant power cuts thereby cutting off local digital companies from their lifeblood -- access to the global network			0
yet in spite of the danger of a complete economic meltdown , the future remains full of opportunity for @entity3 's young digital entrepreneurs			1
it wo n't be easy , of course			0
but a country best known for its antiquities might turn out to be a key hub for radical innovation in our digital economy .			0

@entity272 : @entity3 's digital future is surprisingly encouraging
@entity3 is wracked by the most serious economic crisis for at least a century
yet , amidst all the despair , there is a rebirth going on in @entity3
the irony of this renaissance is that it probably would n't have happened without the crisis
