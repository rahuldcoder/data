-- on january 26 , a ruling by the @entity2 made unlocking a cell phone for use on other carriers illegal under the @entity6 of 1998			1
unbelievably , such a policy means that those unlocking their phones could face up to five years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine			1
this ruling affects average people , international travelers and hundreds of thousands of our service members			1
unlocking your phone not only allows you to move from one carrier to another when your contract is up ; it also increases the resale value of your device			1
this prohibition is a violation of our property rights			2
it makes you wonder , if you ca n't alter the settings on your phone , do you even own your own phone ? this ruling is a clear example of crony capitalism , a consequence of a few companies asking for the law to be changed to their benefit despite the invasion of our property rights , its impact on consumers and its impact on the overall market			1
this decision makes it harder for new participants to enter the market , which hinders competition and leads to less innovation			2
this is why the trade association representing more than 100 wireless carriers across the country ( @entity55 ) , including @entity56 and @entity57 , is strongly in favor of unlocking			1
it 's unfortunate that @entity61 and @entity62 's main lobbying organization was the main proponent of this ban ( the @entity65 )			2
in a number of articles for the @entity69 , i helped turn this into a mainstream issue : " @entity72 ) : it is now a crime to @entity75 " and " @entity76 , @entity77 , and @entity78			0
" i teamed up with @entity79 , an entrepreneur whose company had been shut down for unlocking phones , and we led an advocacy effort for a @entity85 petition			1
our @entity85 petition reached 114,000 signatures , the first petition to reach the new threshold of 100,000 , which requires a response			0
our movement involved a new coalition of actors , many of whom were part of the vocal opposition to the doomed @entity98 , or @entity98 , but also involved groups such as the @entity100 and the @entity101			0
the @entity85 reversed course and came out strongly in favor of unlocking and against the criminal penalties : " the @entity85 agrees with the 114,000 + of you who believe that consumers should be able to unlock their cell phones without risking criminal or other penalties			1
in fact , we believe the same principle should also apply to tablets , which are increasingly similar to smartphones			0
and if you have paid for your mobile device , and are n't bound by a service agreement or other obligation , you should be able to use it on another network			1
it 's common sense , crucial for protecting consumer choice and important for ensuring we continue to have the vibrant , competitive wireless market that delivers innovative products and solid service to meet consumers ' needs			1
" the @entity85 also came out in support of finding legislative fixes to solve this problem			0
the @entity134 has announced an investigation into this issue , and the chairman and a commissioner have publicly spoken in support of unlocking			1
rep. @entity141 , @entity142 , took the lead on this issue and announced that he is working on legislation to fix this problem			0
this is terrific news and a great way for those in @entity148 to help win over the digital generation			0
other members of @entity152 are also coming out in favor			0
there is a groundswell of momentum on this issue			0
but will @entity152 actually fix the problem , or will it just check the box ? ordinary and commonplace technologies have been made illegal by default without any serious policy consideration			1
use of these technologies has to be approved for personal use every three years by the @entity2 -- but even when approved -- developing , trafficking and selling the technologies is still illegal			0
that 's the fundamental problem with unlocking , and that 's the problem that must be permanently fixed , requiring nothing less than legislation to legalize unlocking for personal use permanently			1
merely temporarily reversing the decision of the @entity2 and keeping the underlying technology still illegal , and the personal exception subject to periodic new approval would put us back in this boat every three years			1
such a nonsolution would show that @entity152 , even in the wake of @entity98 , still is n't serious about innovation			1
unfortunately , legislation by sen. @entity181 , @entity182 , and rep. @entity183 , @entity184 , does this very thing , but i have confidence that in the coming weeks it can be improved to fix the problem			0
but beyond unlocking , there are other issues that need to receive serious review and consideration			1
currently , there is an exception for personal jailbreaking ( allowing individuals to install unapproved applications by altering the phone 's operating system ) , but developing , selling , trafficking or discussing the underlying technology is still illegal and there are no personal exceptions for tablets or other devices			1
this makes no sense , especially when according to @ @entity210 , 23 million @entity209 devices are running a version of @entity210 -- a rough barometer of the number of devices that have been jailbroken			0
until recently , personal jailbreaking was illegal as well -- meaning that all of the owners of those devices could be criminally liable			0
a law that potentially makes 23 million people felons punishable by up to five years in prison for activity that does not harm anyone else is a law that must be fixed			1
additionally , accessibility technology for individuals who are blind and deaf is effectively illegal as well and subject to the same ridiculous approval process by the @entity2			2
it is unconscionable that persons who are deaf and blind are considered felons punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine for using technology that they may need to access media			0
we want every teenager who knows how to code to have an incentive to develop a new accessibility technology that may help these people enjoy media -- we may have no idea the potential innovations that we have criminalized senselessly			2
this technology should be made permanently lawful for personal use , creation , trafficking and selling			2
lastly , research into computer science and cryptography for academic purposes should be lawful ( read more on the topic here )			0
there is a current exception , but it is narrow and unclear , and this has a chilling effect upon a lot of legitimate research -- some of the research would actually help protect intellectual property by helping to make digital rights management software stronger			2
computer science research should not be banned without explanation if we want economic growth in the technology sector			0
last year the proposed @entity98 law would have censored the @entity271 and curtailed technological innovation			2
it is easy to see why it inflamed millions of @entity275 whose opposition killed the legislation			0
in this case , the government has banned broad categories of technologies -- and broad categories of uses -- without any clear governmental interest			0
this is another extreme and unacceptable violation of personal freedom			0
a free society should n't have to petition its government every three years to allow access to technologies that are ordinary and commonplace			2
a free society should not ban technologies unless there is a truly overwhelming and compelling governmental interest			0
@entity152 must act to legalize cellphone unlocking substantively , but then it must legalize other technologies that have been banned without explanation			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity300 .			1

@entity300 : a ruling made people subject to *prosecution* for unlocking phones
he says ability to unlock phones gives consumers choice , increases phone value
@entity300 : companies should n't be able to rely on law to *bolster* their competitive position
permanent changes are needed to make unlocking legal , he says
