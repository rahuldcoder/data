-- when a young mother named @entity4 first contacted dr. @entity5 , her baby daughter was interested in almost nothing			1
@entity7 just stared into space			0
she was , said her mother , " in a distant land			0
" @entity4 remembers thinking that maybe @entity5 " could be our @entity11 and give us a road map to follow with new and better games to help our daughter catch up and be like other toddlers			1
" @entity5 , child psychiatrist , spent 30 years exploring the emotional lives of children			1
the creator of an original approach to teaching and parenting children with autism died last tuesday at the age of 68			1
@entity5 called his method " floor time			1
" the process , he said , begins by " entering a child 's world ... and bringing the child into a shared world			0
" " then , " said dr. @entity5 , " we get cooking			1
" what dr. @entity5 means by " cooking " can be seen on this video			2
a mother and father are trying hard to connect with their 3 - year - old son , @entity39 , to no avail			0
the fire is lit at one minute and 51 seconds into the video			0
" from his vantage point -- on the floor of his office -- @entity5 seizes that " @entity60 " to steer @entity39 's parents into their little boy 's world , in much the same way that he guided the @entity55 into @entity7 's world at the beginning of an 18 - year journey that @entity7 's mother recalls			2
in an interview with @entity0 last summer , @entity5 was ailing and in pain			2
but his passion was intact			0
" each and every week when i see patients , i learn something new , " he said			0
children were @entity5 's teachers			1
" i still am amazed at gifted parents and what they teach me in my practice , " he said			0
one thing that makes his approach to autism , and parenting in general , so distinctive , is that he treated what appeared to be strange behaviors as windows of opportunity -- as new paths to distant lands			1
watching @entity5 recount for @entity0 the story of an autistic boy he 'd seen a few days earlier reveals something beyond parenting though -- when you 're passionate about your work , you can be ailing and cooking at the same time .			2
