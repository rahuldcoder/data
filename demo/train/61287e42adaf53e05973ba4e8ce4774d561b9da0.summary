@entity0 , @entity1 -- the homes are built with mud and straw			1
the streets are dirt and puddles			0
an old @entity10 lady gestures that she 's so hungry it feels like her belly has been slit			1
this is @entity0 , a tumbledown @entity10 village in the heart of @entity1			1
if fate had dealt a girl known as " @entity18 " a different hand , she would have grown up here , surrounded by decay and poverty			2
dna tests have now solved part of the mystery of @entity18 , the child called the " blond angel " by @entity28 media after she was discovered during a police raid on a @entity10 camp in @entity31 , @entity28			1
her birth parents are @entity1 -- @entity33 and @entity34 -- and , like the @entity28 couple who had been raising @entity18 , they , too , are @entity10			1
dna from ' @entity18 ' matches that of @entity1 couple " @entity18 's parents live by selling herbs they collect in the forest or recycling scrap metal			1
they get child support payments , too , but that 's never enough , " a neighbor who gave his name as @entity44 said			2
@entity18 's biological family live in a one - room home made of the same mud bricks as the rest of the village			1
the walls have been whitewashed , and a single window is partly covered with a pane of glass , the rest with a sheet of plastic			0
the inhabitants of @entity0 complain that when it rains , the houses flood and the mud buildings get drenched			2
when we called at the home friday , a few hours before the dna match was confirmed , the @entity62 had left			0
producers at a national tv station later confirmed they had paid for them to go to the @entity1 capital @entity69 , a three - hour drive away , for an interview scheduled to air sunday night			2
the previous day , however , @entity33 had spoken to @entity2 's sister channel in @entity74			1
she denied allegations she had sold her baby in @entity28 or that @entity18 had been trafficked abroad by a criminal gang			1
the @entity10 : a thousand years of discrimination continues in @entity80 , advocates say " we gave her away			1
i did n't take any money			2
i did n't have any food to give to her			0
since i saw her on the tv , i 've been sick , " she said			0
@entity33 also said she did not initially name the girl " @entity18 " but had intended to call her " @entity90			2
" even though the @entity62 had left the village for the weekend , two teenagers who say they are @entity18 's brother and sister -- 13 - year - old @entity94 and 14 - year - old @entity95 -- were home alone			1
when i caught up with @entity94 he told me he had no idea the @entity62 had left			0
he told me he had just come back from school			0
he does n't speak @entity1 -- neighbors were on hand to translate our conversation			1
angel like many in @entity0 speaks only @entity106			2
that , for historical reasons , is the language @entity10 speak here			2
their ancestors arrived in the @entity113 as soldiers or auxiliaries in the armies of the @entity117 some 500 years ago			0
a day 's drive away across the border , @entity18 , now believed to be 5 or 6 years old , speaks no @entity28			1
she has grown up speaking the @entity10 dialect , derived from ancient @entity121			2
that was the language @entity123 spoke when they migrated from @entity125 more than 1,000 years ago			0
@entity2 visits @entity10 community where ' @entity18 ' was found i caught up with a woman who says she 's @entity18 's big sister --- @entity33 's eldest daughter -- 20 - year - old @entity129 , in the next village , @entity129			1
she has very pale skin , white - blond hair tinged with red , and her eyes are bothered by bright sunlight			0
@entity18 , too , is very fair			0
and in the @entity10 camp where she was found , residents said @entity18 had been born with an eye problem , but they were unable to specify the exact diagnosis			1
when she was cured , the @entity10 threw a special celebration			0
@entity129 explained to me that mother @entity33 had traveled to @entity28 in 2009 to work on the orange harvest			2
" my mum was pregnant at that time and gave birth , but she did not have the money to bring her baby home			2
she did not sell @entity18 but left her there and came back to @entity1 to try and arrange the documents , " she said			1
the plight of the @entity10 investigators on both sides of the border , however , doubt that version of events			0
@entity157 and @entity158 , the @entity28 @entity10 couple who raised @entity18 from a few months old , are still in custody charged with kidnapping			1
and on friday afternoon , @entity1 police said they had launched a criminal investigation on suspicion the @entity62 had sold @entity18 for illegal adoption			1
law enforcement sources in @entity28 say @entity1 women have in the past been detected traveling heavily pregnant into @entity28			1
they say once they give birth they pass their children off to childless @entity28 couples for an agreed payment			2
underscoring those assertions , @entity28 police said friday they had arrested a non-roma @entity28 couple in @entity174 on charges of trying to buy a @entity10 baby for 4,000 euros ( $ 5,500 )			1
investigators have not given any hint how long it may take to prove or discount their allegations that @entity18 may have been the victim of an illegal adoption			0
what is immediately clear , though , is that she , like many @entity10 children , is a victim of crushing poverty			0
the @entity185 says of the estimated 12 million @entity10 in the @entity185 , 90 % live below the poverty line			0
in @entity0 , many inhabitants say they , like @entity18 's parents , regularly travel to @entity28 to harvest fruit and vegetables			1
in @entity28 , impoverished @entity10 in the camp where @entity18 was found say they are now faced with competition for farm jobs from @entity1 , @entity194 and @entity195 @entity10 who are even more desperate than them and ready to work for as little as 10 euros a day			1
as i said goodbye to @entity198 , she asked if @entity18 would be allowed to come home to the family			0
" my mother really wants her to come and live with them			0
she 's been crying , and she 's so worried , " she said			0
for now , there seems little immediate prospect of a family reunion			0
@entity1 's @entity206 went to @entity0 on friday to carry out what they said was an assessment of @entity33 's " suitability as a parent " and the family 's living conditions			1
by nightfall , the same state officials were back with police to take @entity94 and @entity95 into protective care			0
a female relative had taken in the youngsters			0
she began to wail loudly at the prospect of the adolescents being taken away			0
just then , we saw another neighbor dodge past the police officers and help @entity94 and @entity95 slip away into the night .			0

@entity2 's @entity225 visits the @entity1 @entity10 village where " @entity18 " grew up
