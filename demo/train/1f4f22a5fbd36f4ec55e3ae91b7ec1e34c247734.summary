@entity0 -- first , it was a record - breaking book series , selling more than 450 million copies worldwide			2
then , it became the most successful movie franchise in history			0
now , it is a theme - park phenomenon that has fans in a frenzy			1
@entity10 , a second area of the @entity12 , opens july 8 at @entity13			1
guests will be immersed in the new @entity16 paradise , which spans about 20 acres and includes a high - tech ride , the @entity19 restaurant , a handful of elaborate shops and stage shows , and the @entity23 between @entity10 and the separate @entity25 area in the adjacent @entity27 park			1
" @entity30 smartly involved ( " @entity16 " series author @entity31 ) and the production designers from the @entity16 films in every step of the design process , " said @entity28 , editor of @entity29			1
this means nearly every detail , down to the cobblestone streets and the @entity23 , is just as it was in the films			0
the marquee ride @entity16 and the @entity41 from @entity42 puts guests smack dab in the middle of the recognizable grand bank lobby filled with hardworking animatronic goblins , some counting money , others jotting down bank records			1
turn the corner and head down the hallway , and you realize you 're in @entity56 's office			0
then , board souped - up elevators that make you feel as if you are going deep into the cavernous vaults			2
finally , hop into a 12 - person vehicle that takes you into @entity62			2
it 's part roller coaster , part @entity67 motion - based ride			1
the other attraction , the @entity23 , where @entity16 meets pals @entity68 and @entity70 in the first movie , is equally detailed			0
it takes about four minutes to shuttle people back and forth between @entity25 ( in @entity27 ) and @entity10 ( in @entity30 )			1
once on board , guests step into train carriages			0
as the doors shut , the 3 - d video screens show images of @entity81 on a flying motorcycle , the @entity56 twins on their brooms and the @entity85 in @entity86			2
but keep an eye on the doorway , where shadows of @entity90 , @entity16 , @entity70 and @entity68 make guests feel like they are in a scene from the movies			0
the themed land also includes a number of shops frequented by the young wizards in the movies , such as @entity56 's @entity99 , which sells unusual items like @entity101 that come with @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			2
( in the movies , wizards use these to make themselves appear ill. in real life , they are sweet treats			0
) inside @entity111 , you 'll find armillary spheres ( $ 179.95 ) , which wizards use in astronomy class , and in madam @entity116 's @entity115 , there are loads of @entity23 ties and robes , quaffles and brooms ranging from $ 34.95 to $ 300			0
@entity122 has a menu featuring @entity125 classics like toad in the hole ( sausage baked in a flour - egg batter , $ 8.99 ) , fish and chips , and bangers and mash			2
plus , there are draught beers brewed specifically for @entity10 , including @entity135 and @entity136 , and non-alcoholic drinks like @entity138 and @entity139			1
perhaps the most talked - about food item is butterbeer ice cream , served at @entity143 's @entity142			0
there are live shows throughout the day			0
" @entity148 " features a troupe of four from the @entity147			0
the lively performers retell two of the famed tales of @entity148 , a 15th - century author of wizarding fairy tales			0
the other show is a lively musical performance featured in the @entity16 movies			0
the boy with the lightning - bolt scar on his forehead is ingrained in pop culture			0
so , it comes as no surprise that @entity30 continues to invest in the franchise			1
" @entity12 - @entity25 ( which opened in 2010 ) has been one of the most successful attractions in the history of themed entertainment , in terms of attendance numbers , @entity30 's bottom line and the impact it has had on the rest of the industry , " said @entity165 , industry analyst with @entity166			1
likewise , expanding the @entity177 by creating @entity10 at @entity30 , which @entity165 says has cost about $ 400 million to construct , was a no - brainer			1
" @entity25 reportedly cost over $ 250 million , " he added , " so this is @entity181 's most significant investment to date			1
" plus , " combined attendance at @entity27 and @entity30 has jumped more than 50 % since 2009 , " @entity165 said			2
" @entity181 's theme park revenue is up nearly 40 % since 2009 , much of which can be directly attributed to the popular @entity185			0
" @entity10 will certainly lure park - goers to @entity0 , which is experiencing one of the most significant expansion periods in the destination 's history			1
according to @entity192 , there were 59 million visitors in 2013 , up 27 % from 46.6 million in 2009			0
if you go : admission into @entity13 ( $ 96 for adults and $ 90 for kids ages 3 to 9 ) allows you to roam around the park and visit @entity10			1
however , if you 'd like to pop over to @entity25 ( at @entity27 ) via the @entity23 , you must purchase park - to - park admission ( $ 136 for adults , $ 130 for kids ages 3 to 9 ) .			1

@entity10 at @entity13 expands the @entity12
a new ride , escape from @entity42 , is at the center of this part of the experience
general admission to @entity30 includes @entity10 but not @entity25
park - to - park admission is required to visit both @entity10 and @entity25
