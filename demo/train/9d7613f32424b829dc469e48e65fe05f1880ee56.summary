@entity0 defined the disco era			1
her brazenly sexual hits " @entity4 " and " @entity5 " horrified some and delighted many more when they came out			1
they also helped to propel disco into a national phenomenon			1
even now , the sound of her voice -- controlled yet passionate -- summons up the hedonistic , willful spirit of the late 1970s			0
@entity0 died from cancer thursday at 63			1
her passing offers an opportunity to reconsider her musical contributions and the legacy of disco			2
news : the legacy of @entity23 's disco queen is lasting but she deserves more than nostalgic praise , because her records with producer @entity27 have had a lasting effect on pop music			1
listen to @entity31 's " @entity30 , " for starters			2
not only does the disco - inflected rhythm evoke @entity36 's dance tunes , but as a gay - pride anthem , it recalls the roiling , joyful setting in which @entity0 's music first found its audience			1
disco originated in the 1970s @entity44 club scene , and it was @entity0 's " @entity4 " and then the @entity47 ' " @entity46 " that catapulted it onto the national stage			1
in " @entity4 , " a strong - voiced woman gives herself over to pure pleasure			2
this feeling of abandon reflected the spirit of the emerging gay liberation movement			0
overheard on @entity54 : dim all the lights ; this ' last dance ' goes out to @entity0 back then , the music and its culture was huge			1
but to be honest , these days @entity0 -- and the disco craze she embodied -- sometimes get a bum rap			1
disco is a kind of guilty pleasure for people of a certain age , a slightly embarrassing hangover from the simultaneously wild and innocent days of their youth			0
but they -- we -- have nothing to be ashamed of , and neither does @entity0			2
because underneath the flashy exterior and dated trappings of the best disco records lurks true heart and soul			0
and disco records do n't get better than the ones @entity0 made with @entity27			1
listen to a playlist of @entity0 's greatest hits " @entity4 , " a top 10 hit in 1976 , largely consists of vocal moans and sighs over an orchestrated rhythm track			1
" at first it was startling , almost embarrassing -- even in this age of rampant pornography , " wrote critic @entity83 in 1978			0
and @entity0 's sexy album covers fed into the disco diva persona			1
but she was no moonlighting fashion model			0
born in @entity90 , she had performed in @entity92 productions of " @entity93 " and " hair " before she met @entity27 in @entity95			0
@entity27 crafted a sleek musical background for her creamy vocals , cushioned by strings , synthesizers and a fluid dance beat			0
when the tingling " @entity5 " hit the @entity102 in 1977 , her sound became almost purely electronic			0
perhaps this is the moment when the machines began to take over the music business			0
in reality , @entity0 never conformed to the stereotype of disco singer as producer 's plaything , despite @entity27 's commanding presence			1
she was ambitious , releasing concept albums such as " a @entity113 " and " @entity114 " and an epic disco - fied version of " @entity116 , " by 1960s songwriter @entity117			0
and at the end of the 1970s , @entity0 came into her own			2
the double album " @entity120 " was her magnum opus			0
even disco - hating rock fans were taken aback			0
" @entity120 " added soaring lead guitar lines and more varied songwriting to the mix. the singles " @entity120 " and " @entity127 " took this disco - rock fusion to the top of the pop charts , while the slow - dance " @entity133 " revealed more of @entity0 's personality than her earlier hits			1
later in the ' 70s , @entity0 became a born - again @entity135 and began to distance herself ever so slightly from her sexy image			1
in the 1980s , @entity23 moved on from disco , and so did @entity0			1
she dabbled in @entity139 schmaltz , made an ambitious album with @entity141 and came bouncing back with the assertive " @entity142 " at the dawn of the @entity145 era			0
she continued to record comeback albums well into the 1990s , but over the past decade or so , the new music came less frequently			0
she performed the occasional greatest hits tours after the disco craze had long since retreated			2
and her music gained hipster cachet , even fully divorced from the cultural flash of its time			2
indeed , every synth - pop group from @entity156 on down owes @entity0 a big thank you , if not a royalty check , for the influence and innovation of " @entity5			2
" " generally i do n't think there is too much art involved in what i do , " said @entity27 in 1978 at the peak of his career			0
" but i do know that i achieved something specially different with ' @entity4 ' and ' @entity5			2
' these songs will endure			0

@entity170 : @entity0 , who died thursday , defined the disco era of the ' 70s
he says her music first found audience in @entity44 's gay club scene , then gained national fame
he says her " @entity4 " was a racy , *controversial* and influential hit
