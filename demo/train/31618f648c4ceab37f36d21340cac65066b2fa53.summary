one military wife recalls staying up all night and deleting every @entity3 picture of her children , every post that mentioned them or where they went to school			1
she googled herself , trying to figure out how easy it would be to find where the family lived			2
in the morning , she went to her car and scraped the military decal off the front window			1
as the spouse of a @entity16 soldier , she 's always tried to be conscious of how much she advertises that she and her three young children are a military family			1
" it 's hard because i am so proud of what my husband does , but lately so many spouses that i know are actually scared that they could be targets of @entity26 or someone who sympathizes with @entity26 , " she said , asking that @entity1 keep her name out of the story for that reason			1
this week brought the latest in a string of attacks that members of military families say has spooked them into quietly changing the way they operate online and in real life			1
the @entity37 military 's @entity35 account was hacked			1
in all caps , this message : " american soldiers , we are coming			1
" the tweet included a link to a statement that said , in part , " we wo n't stop ! we know everything about you , your wives and children			2
@entity37 soldiers ! we 're watching you ! " the hacker managed to post other threatening messages , propaganda videos and some military documents until the accounts were disabled			1
@entity35 quickly assured that it was relatively easy to hack @entity35 , no serious security details were revealed and it would find who was behind the hack			1
@entity63 wife @entity62 said the messages just amplified the anxiety she already feels after recent terror attacks targeting military personnel , law enforcement officers and civilians			1
she and other family members told @entity1 this week that they first began to think about the possibility in may 2013 when a uniformed @entity72 soldier in @entity73 was murdered by two men who shouted " @entity75 , " or " @entity76 is great			2
" others started to fear the possibility of their service members or themselves being targeted after the killing of a @entity82 soldier during an october attack on the country 's @entity84			0
attacks and plots in @entity88 have them concerned , too , they said			1
in september , the @entity88 prime minister said a plot to kidnap a member of the public , behead the victim and then drape him or her in an @entity26 flag had been thwarted			1
in december , a self - styled @entity96 cleric held hostages in a @entity99 cafe for 17 hours , a drama that ended with the deaths of two hostages			0
the gunman , who was known for sending hate mail to military families , was killed			2
the slayings in @entity107 , for which @entity108 has taken responsibility , have prompted @entity110 to think about security at @entity113 's @entity112			0
" before the incident in @entity82 , i honestly did n't think @entity26 was a threat to our family or other military families , " she said			1
" i worry about the hundreds , thousands of folks going to and from work in uniform			0
they , too , could be targets			0
i think of other areas around the country where there 's a large military presence -- an attack , ambush , lone terrorist is something i fear			1
" i hate to say it , but i honestly no longer think if , but when and where , " she said			0
" i think it 's only a matter of time			0
" in late november , the @entity138 issued a warning to @entity37 military members that @entity26 was calling for attacks against them , a law enforcement source told @entity1			1
the source said that " overseas based individuals are looking for like - minded individuals in the @entity37 to carry out these attacks			1
" the warning asked members of the military to " review their online social media presence for any information that might attract the attention of violent extremists			1
" the bulletin also said authorities were concerned that @entity26 members were " spotting and assessing " individuals in the @entity37 who may be interested in carrying out attacks inside the country against members of the military , a @entity37 counterterror official told @entity1			1
@entity159 , who is married to a commanding officer , said she knows military members and spouses who have stopped openly carrying their uniforms to their car after a visit to the dry cleaners			1
some have stopped wearing clothing with military insignia and are more careful when they open their wallet to avoid showing military ids or payment cards			2
the small , simple changes do n't mean military family members are running scared , @entity159 said			2
but it was difficult when her young daughter was watching television this week and saw the news about the @entity181 hack and the threat that @entity26 was coming for soldiers			1
" she turned and looked at me and you could see it registering -- we 're soldiers			1
she had a very worried look , " @entity159 said			0
" but kids are comforted by whatever their parents tell them			0
we ca n't live our lives in fear and we try to reassure them			0
" a blogger and communications firm ceo , @entity159 wonders how she would even begin to scrub her online presence			1
@entity198 says she 's thrown her hands up			0
her memoir , " @entity200 " is a critical success			0
she 's done a lot of press and is omnipresent online			2
" i 'm probably screwed if @entity26 starts targeting yappy military spouses , so it 's too late now ! there 's also a part of me that thinks that 's what they want -- to make us always looking over our shoulders			1
so no. no to all of it , " she said			0
it 's a matter of principle , she and others said			0
why should families bend to fear and stop sharing online when social media has helped many of them get through 14 years of nonstop war ? though the military has at times struggled with how much freedom its members should have on social media , relatives have wholeheartedly embraced it			1
military families appear to use social media at higher rates than civilians , according to data from the @entity234			2
social media as we now know it was n't even around when the @entity238 war began			0
@entity3 launched in 2004 , almost exactly a year after the @entity37 invaded @entity239			1
now , dozens of military spouses have blogs and @entity3 caters to the community			1
a 2014 survey by military advocacy group @entity244 found that 75 % of 6,200 respondents considered the use of social media to be very important			2
beyond using it to get practical information like , say , what 's happening on a base , social platforms opened up a military culture that has historically discouraged displays of emotion			2
social media has offered a safe space to reveal trauma and heartache			0
it 's brought more comfort and less isolation			0
a spouse in @entity264 who was gripped by depression during a third deployment can find a spouse in @entity268 who was going through the same thing , and they can help each other in a way that no traditional therapy could			0
spouse @entity276 relies on her new non-profit 's website @entity279 to be a conduit to family members who have suffered from depression and the general wrung - out feeling of enduring years of war			0
her husband has been deployed to @entity239 and @entity238 five times			0
" i see being online as a way to stay honest , to stay healthy , to help , " she said			2
" i do n't want that to be hurt because of some threats that are just some dumb hacker			0
i do n't want to let them win that way			0
the @entity63 wife writes the @entity296 column for @entity297 , which has 10 million members			0
" being a military family is a vulnerable experience , period			2
if you live in a military town , this is the norm , " she said			2
" is there more cautiousness now ? sure , but that 's not a bad thing			0
( there wo n't ) be a victory for anyone who thinks they can frighten us			0
" @entity1 's @entity314 and @entity315 contributed to this report .			0
