-- there were no long lines waiting to see " @entity7 " at the urban multiplex closest to where i live in @entity5 a mild surprise , since this was n't , after all , just any movie 's opening friday			1
this was , as we kept being told , a @entity17 , the biggest , darkest and most eagerly anticipated of the many @entity14 blockbusters being wheeled out to the movie - going public			1
it was also a workday			0
and i was willing to believe that there were too many people who did n't or could n't play hooky , no matter how much frothing hype had been aroused on @entity23 's -- sorry , the @entity23 's -- behalf			1
but this was no ordinary opening friday -- or any other friday			0
less than six hours before i arrived at the box office , a lone gunman opened fire in a darkened theater in @entity29 , @entity30 , whose seats were jammed with men , women and children gathered for a special midnight showing of " @entity7			1
" he killed and injured numerous people			0
for those who survive , i would guess that going into a dark room to watch a movie will never be the same again			2
the only outward sign at my screening yesterday was another ticket - taker at the entrance asking to look into my book bag			2
others were likewise asked to show the contents of their carry - on items			2
it was n't a full house , but this was one of those theaters where the movie was being screened in several theaters at once			1
as the lights dimmed , i heard the crackle of police radios by the exits			0
then darkness -- and the show			0
of the movie itself , it 's enough to say , for now , that it succeeded in absorbing my attention , using every one of its estimated $ 250 million to fill its 164 minutes			1
it was too long by half , just like every other summer blockbuster that preceded it			0
but it was conceived with surging ambition , executed with imaginative cunning , performed with admirable conviction and succeeded at doing what it was build to do : make me forget the outside world 's travails -- even the fact that people died hours ago watching this film			0
and what did they see ? i do n't know how far they got before the true horrors began , but here 's some of what i remember			2
( i 'm going to spoil some things for you here because i 'm trying to make a point			0
so skip the next few sentences if you want )			0
several bridges blow up during the course of the film			0
you do n't see close - ups of people trapped in cars plunging into the river			1
nor do you see what actually happens to the people on a football field ravaged by an underground explosion , though a field microphone is snatched quickly off the corpse of a dead official			0
otherwise , little blood , not much gore , just a lot of stuff blowing up and limbs being cracked ... real people died , hours ago , watching this stuff			2
the thought lurked in the back of my head for most of the movie			2
it pushed itself to the forefront as i walked onto the sidewalk			0
this is not to place the blame for anything that happened in @entity29 on this movie , though i knew , minutes after i 'd heard the news , that there were pundits , legislators , radio hosts and concerned parents who were going to do so			2
( in fact it would seem as if somebody already has )			0
we are at this writing some distance away from assessing what the suspect 's motives were			0
and yet , there was darkness shrouding " @entity7 " even before the shooting			1
@entity142 , my old friend and colleague from the @entity144 , was besieged over the past week by death threats for his less - than - glowing review of the movie			1
there are other film reviewer friends who have likewise been verbally harassed , in varying degrees of ugliness , over critiques of @entity23 movies that were n't nearly as , well , critical as @entity142 's			1
i 'm not anxious to find direct psychological connections between fandom run amok and cold - blooded murder			2
nor do i feel an urgent need to prosecute popular culture for capital crimes , though i 'm also not naÃ ¯ ve enough to believe that people 's feelings ca n't be adversely affected by what they see and hear			1
there 's a lot i simply do n't know for sure , about the shootings , about the suspect , about the victims for that matter			1
i do know this : that culture , popular or otherwise , can do many things to make us feel connected			1
it can at its most euphoric or engaged detach us from misery , loneliness and pain			2
but ultimately it can not free or save us from these ills			1
the movie i saw today permitted me to forget for almost three hours what happened to people who saw it two time zones away			0
it could n't -- and did n't -- keep me from caring about them			0
and from worrying about the rest of us			0
editor 's note : " @entity7 " is released by @entity189 which , like @entity0 , is owned by @entity190			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			1

a gunman went on a killing spree at a movie theater showing " @entity7 "
@entity193 : the movie absorbs attention while we feel pain for the real - life victims
we ca n't really prosecute popular culture for capital crimes , he says
@entity209 : ultimately , movies can not free or save us from the ills in *society*
