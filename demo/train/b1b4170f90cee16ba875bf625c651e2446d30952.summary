@entity0 -- the operation to recover bodies from the crash of @entity7 447 , which plunged into the @entity8 two years ago , has ended with 27 more sets of human remains brought to the surface , a @entity3 official told @entity1 on wednesday			1
that means 74 bodies will never be found			1
the last group of bodies was brought to the surface on friday , @entity14 said wednesday			2
a total of 104 bodies were recovered from the remains of the mystery crash during this year 's operation , in addition to the 50 that were found in the days after the loss of the plane			1
human remains and aircraft parts are headed by ship to the @entity31 , where they are expected to arrive thursday , @entity3 air accident investigators said			1
from there , they will be transferred to @entity35 in southwest @entity3 , investigators said			1
all 228 people onboard were killed when the plane crashed in stormy weather en route to @entity0 from @entity40 on june 1 , 2009			1
it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage , still containing many bodies , in a mountain range deep under the ocean			1
seventy - five bodies were recovered late last month , more than doubling the number of remains that have been found , the vice president of the @entity3 victims ' association told @entity1			1
the remains have not yet been identified , @entity55 said			2
@entity55 got the news from a @entity3 government liaison appointed to deal with victims ' families , he said			2
" personally , i would have preferred to leave the bodies of our loved ones on the seafloor , " he added , repeating his long - held view			2
other victims ' relatives disagree			0
details of the doomed plane 's last minutes began to emerge last month as @entity3 air accident investigators studied data recorders recovered from the wreck earlier this year			1
the @entity72 plummeted 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds amid conflicting information that may have led the pilots to make bad decisions , @entity3 's @entity76 ( @entity76 ) said last month			1
the pilots got conflicting air speed readings in the minutes leading up to the crash , according to an interim report			0
the aircraft climbed to 38,000 feet when " the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled , " the report says			2
aviation experts are asking why the pilots responded to the stall by pulling the nose up instead of pushing it down to recover			0
" you push down on the wheel to gain air speed , perhaps they ( pilots ) were getting information that the air speed was too high , " said @entity88 , a pilot and aviation analyst			0
" pulling the nose up will exacerbate an aerodynamic stall			0
" the speeds displayed on the left primary flight display were " inconsistent " with those on the integrated standby instrument system ( @entity104 ) , the report says			0
the aircraft experienced some " rolling " before stalling and then descending rapidly at 10,912 feet ( 3,300 meters ) per minute			0
at the time of the descent , the two co-pilots and captain were in the aircraft cockpit			0
the pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the @entity8 known for constant bands of severe turbulence			0
air crash investigators at the @entity0 - based @entity76 have been working on the theory that the speed sensors , known as pitot tubes or probes , malfunctioned because of ice at high altitude			0
@entity1 's @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
