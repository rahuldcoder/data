the cafe siege in the heart of @entity2 ended early tuesday with the death of the gunman and two of his hostages -- but a great deal of unanswered questions remain			1
" this has been an absolutely appalling and ugly incident , " @entity10 prime minister @entity9 said , noting that @entity2 had been " touched by terrorism for the first time in more than 35 years			2
" details have emerged about the two hostages who died amid the siege 's chaotic final moments -- and about the man who held them and others captive			1
but with police still investigating what happened during the 16 long hours of the hostage taking , here 's a summary of what we know and do n't know about key aspects of the story : the victims what we know : authorities have identified the two hostages who were killed : @entity33 , 38 , and @entity34 , 34			1
a growing number of tributes are being paid to @entity37 , a lawyer , and @entity34 , the manager of the cafe			1
@entity37 , a mother of three , worked down the street from the cafe			2
@entity34 had been employed by @entity42 for more than two years			1
what we do n't know : how exactly they died			1
unconfirmed reports in @entity10 media suggest both @entity37 and @entity34 may have been killed trying to protect others			1
the @entity49 reported that @entity34 was trying to wrestle the gun from the hostage taker			1
the @entity52 reported that @entity37 was trying to defend a pregnant colleague			2
police have declined to comment on the reports , saying what happened is still under investigation			1
the gunman what we know : the hostage - taker has been named as man @entity62 , a 50 - year - old man who was born in @entity63 and settled in @entity10			1
@entity10 prime minister @entity9 described @entity62 as " a deeply disturbed individual ( with ) a long history of crime , a long history of mental instability and infatuation with extremism			1
" he pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive letters to the families of @entity10 troops			2
he was also facing charges of being an accessory to murder , as well as over 45 sexual and assault related offenses , according to authorities			1
what we do n't know : why he was n't being more closely monitored ? @entity9 summed up the questions on many people 's minds tuesday when he asked at a news conference , " how can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community ? " he said @entity10 authorities would be looking at those questions " in the days and weeks ahead			1
" the motive what we know : during the siege , @entity9 said the hostage - taker " sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ( @entity103 ) death cult , " referring to the terrorist group that has seized control of large areas of @entity108 and @entity109			1
according to his website and social media posts , @entity62 styled himself as a @entity113 cleric , espousing extremist views			2
after he settled in @entity10 , @entity62 " became sympathetic to what he perceived ... was the victimization of @entity113 and @entity119 around the world , " his former lawyer @entity115 told @entity121			0
but his bigger cause , according to @entity122 , was lobbying the @entity10 government against sending troops to fight in wars on foreign soil like @entity128 , where @entity62 said innocent women and children were being killed			0
@entity62 was " intensely conflicted and contradicted and inconsistent , " @entity115 said			0
what we do n't know : what @entity62 was trying to achieve by taking hostages in the cafe			1
the full picture is yet to emerge of what demands he made of authorities			1
@entity10 media reported monday that he requested an @entity103 flag and a phone call with @entity9			0
@entity115 said that when he represented @entity62 last year , he " never , ever spoke of physical violence of any kind			0
" he suggested that something might have happened in the intervening months that caused him " to become unhinged			1
" @entity146 ' last tweet linked to his website , with a message posted the day of his attack on the @entity2 cafe : " if we stay silent towards the criminals we can not have a peaceful society			0
the more you fight with crime , the more peaceful you are			0
" the siege what we know : after around 16 hours of the agonizing standoff , police moved in after hearing gunfire inside the cafe , according @entity164 police commissioner @entity163			1
the @entity52 reported that a technical support sniper positioned on the second floor of a building opposite the store made the call -- " hostage down ... window two " -- that changed the course of events			0
police say they believe @entity62 was acting alone			0
besides the two people who were killed , four others were wounded by gunshots and two pregnant women were being assessed for health and welfare , police said			0
all of them were reported to be in stable condition			0
what we do n't know : what exactly happened inside the cafe			1
while reports of what took place are emerging in the @entity10 media , authorities are staying tight - lipped as investigations continue			2
" we 're clearly speaking to those victims and we 're clearly speaking to other witnesses			0
but this is going to take a bit of time to piece this together because a lot of those people are quite traumatized , " said @entity164 deputy police commissioner @entity193			0
the reaction what we know : @entity10 leaders have applauded the reaction of their citizens , pointing to the large numbers of flowers being laid at the scene of the siege in tribute to the victims			2
" people have gone about their business and in the aftermath of the end of the siege last night , people have responded with typical @entity10 decency and generosity , " @entity9 said			2
@entity113 leaders in @entity10 quickly condemned the hostage taking as " a criminal act " that has no place in @entity119			0
amid fears that @entity10 @entity113 could become the targets of retaliatory attacks , @entity224 users offered to accompany @entity113 wearing religious clothes on public transport as a gesture of solidarity			0
the social media campaign took off , with the hashtag # illridewithyou becoming the top trending hashtag globally in a few hours			0
meanwhile , the @entity164 police announced tuesday that it was launching a three - week operation across @entity2 focused on " high - visibility policing , increased presence in public places and public transport hubs			0
" what we do n't know : what the future holds			2
the cafe siege has raised troubling questions about the possibility of more so - called " lone wolf " attacks			2
" the tragedy of these times is that there are people , even in a society such as ours , who wish to do us harm , " @entity9 said			0
" we are not immune to the politically motivated violence which has for so long stalked other countries			0
" in recent months , @entity10 introduced some of the toughest anti-terrorism laws in the world and raised the national terrorism alert level			0
but @entity9 said that authorities can only do so much to prevent attacks without prior warning and knowledge			2
" even if this individual --- this sick and disturbed individual --- had been front and centre on our watch lists , even if this individual had been monitored 24 hours a day , it 's quite likely , certainly possible , that this incident could have taken place , because the level of control that would be necessary to prevent people from going about their daily life would be very , very high indeed , " the prime minister said			1
the scene in @entity2 : grenades and gunfire			0

the hostages who died are identified as @entity33 and @entity34
it 's *unclear* what exactly happened in the final moments of the siege
authorities are trying to figure out why the gunman was n't on terrorist watch lists
described as " deeply disturbed , " the attacker 's aims and motive remain *uncertain*
