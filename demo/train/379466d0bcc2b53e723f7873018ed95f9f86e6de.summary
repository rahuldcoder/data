a huge chunk of @entity2 's male population is salivating at the imminent arrival of @entity4 -- a month long festival of football between the continent 's best soccer sides			1
but the tournament , arguably second only to the @entity10 in scale and prestige , is proving equally popular with the fairer sex , according to new research			0
for @entity18 and @entity19 , two perennial heavyweights in the four - yearly competition , women make up nearly half of the huge support they attract			1
this is a far greater figure than @entity23 , whose domestic @entity24 is one of the world 's most popular competitions , where the national team 's supporter profile contains around 33 % females			1
@entity32 's @entity4 predictions @entity37 , from firm @entity34 who conducted the survey , says the @entity24 has attracted more female fans to the game in recent years , but has a way to go to match its continental rivals			1
" in @entity18 in particular , the national association has been ahead of the game for some time in this sense , " he told @entity42			2
" cultural differences also come into play to a degree , but you only have to look at the profile of women 's football in @entity18 compared to the @entity52 for an example of the work that has been done			0
" ultimately , it 's a major goal for all clubs and organizations to engage more female fans			2
in most @entity2 markets , male interest in football is so incredibly high it is close to reaching a ceiling			0
" however the potential for growing female interest is huge -- and , at the end of the day , it equates to more people playing the game and more people investing in the game			0
" @entity72 , rather than @entity73 and @entity74 , dominates @entity4 storylines @entity18 's burgeoning female football fan population contributes to their position at the top of @entity34 's table , with 62 % of its country 's people supporting the national team and 44 % of that figure made up of women			1
@entity19 are second on the list in terms of well supported nations with 61 % of their population willing the @entity19 onto victory -- and just like @entity18 , 44 % of that figure consists of females			1
@entity96 , the current @entity2 and world champions , can begin their defense in @entity98 and @entity99 safe in the knowledge that half of their countrymen and women will be dedicated to the cause			2
but while @entity23 can rely on the backing of 15.6 million supporters when @entity4 kicks off , that figure only translates to 44 % of the adult population			1
perhaps for a team that has only won one major title -- the 1966 @entity10 -- that is not surprising			0
yet @entity113 , who took both the @entity115 and the @entity116 in 2000 , are bottom of the fan mini-league , with only 38 % of their nation counting themselves as fans of the national team			0
according to @entity37 , @entity23 's poor performances on the pitch in recent years have translated to a drop in fervent fans off it			2
" i think if we were to look back over the past 20 years or so , you would expect to find that @entity23 's domestic supporter base would rival that of @entity18 or @entity19 in terms of the percentage of the population who back the team , " he said			1
" but what is undeniable is that the past couple of years have been very difficult for @entity23 on and off the pitch			0
naturally , that impacts on the brand even although in aspects such as replica shirt sales , @entity23 is still way ahead of its competitors			0
" bringing back the feel - good factor and the pride in the national team has to be considered a major element of manager @entity148 's remit in @entity98 and @entity99 over the coming weeks			0

new study of soccer fans shows female supporters on rise in @entity19 and @entity18
@entity18 will have the biggest backing of big five @entity2 nations with 62 % of population
of that 62 % female fans make up nearly half , with @entity19 attracting similar numbers
@entity23 can rely on 15.6 million fans but figure only translates to 44 % of population
