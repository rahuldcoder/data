@entity0 -- banana producer @entity4 will pay a $ 25 million fine and serve five years ' probation for once paying millions of dollars to groups in @entity8 considered by the @entity9 to be terrorist organizations , a @entity3 spokesman said tuesday			1
a worker at a banana plantation in @entity13 , @entity8 , in december 2000			0
in so doing , the banana producer avoided prosecution for the company 's now - defunct payoff of @entity8 terrorists protecting its most profitable banana - growing operation , according to terms of a plea agreement with the @entity3			1
if approved by @entity9 courts , the $ 25 million fine would represent the largest @entity9 criminal penalty ever imposed under federal global terrorism sanction regulations , said @entity25 spokesman @entity25			2
the regulations prohibit transactions with people who commit , threaten to commit or support @entity9 - designated terrorists and establish penalties for doing so			0
attorneys from the @entity3 's @entity32 and federal prosecutors for the @entity0 filed a joint sentencing motion tuesday asking the court to accept the plea agreement , which was reached march 19 , @entity25 said			1
a hearing on the matter is set for monday			0
in its motion , the government asked that @entity4 be fined and sentenced to probation , as well as being required to implement an effective ethics program in connection with the company 's guilty plea , @entity25 said			1
federal prosecutors accused the @entity48 - based company of paying more than $ 1.7 million to the @entity49 , a right - wing paramilitary group , in two parts of @entity8 where the company grew bananas			1
the payments to the group , known as the @entity49 , went through the company 's @entity8 subsidiary , @entity55 , from 1997 to 2004 , according to court documents filed in the case			0
court papers also say @entity4 paid @entity8 's two leftist guerrilla groups , the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) and @entity61 ( @entity61 ) from about 1989 to 1997			1
at the time , according to court documents , those groups controlled areas where the company grew bananas			1
the @entity49 , @entity60 and @entity61 are all combatants in @entity8 's decade - long civil war , and all have been designated as terrorist organizations by the @entity9			0
in a written statement issued in march , @entity4 ceo @entity70 said the company viewed the plea agreement " as a reasoned solution to the dilemma the company faced several years ago			1
" the company voluntarily disclosed the payments to the @entity3 in 2003 , he said , adding the payments were made " to protect the lives of its employees			2
" court documents said the company began making the payments after a @entity55 general manager met with the then - leader of the @entity49 , @entity83			0
@entity83 told the manager that the @entity49 was preparing to drive @entity60 from @entity8 's @entity86 region and asked for payments to be made to the @entity49 through private security companies			0
" @entity83 sent an unspoken but clear message that failure to make the payments could result in physical harm to @entity55 personnel and property , " court documents said			0
charges filed in the case said senior company executives knew about the payments to the @entity49 and , while checks were written to the security companies , the companies provided no actual services			0
in 2002 , after the @entity9 government designated the @entity49 as a terrorist organization , @entity4 began paying the organization in cash , according to court documents , and continued the payments even after being told by outside counsel that the payments were illegal and should be stopped			1
in the motion filed tuesday , federal prosecutors noted @entity4 's cooperation in the investigation and its voluntary disclosure of its illegal activity , @entity25 said			2
while the government considered filing additional charges in the matter , it decided not to " after an extensive investigation and after considering critical evidence and information that @entity4 provided through its post-plea cooperation , " he said			2
@entity4 sold @entity55 to another company more than two years ago but remains one of the largest purchasers of bananas in @entity8			2
