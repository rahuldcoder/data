-- after finishing tied for 40th at the masters in april , @entity1 might have been expected to throw himself into a punishing training regime			1
after all , golf 's @entity5 champion was one of the tipsters ' favorites to take the title in @entity10			1
but the 22 - year - old @entity11 , so often hyped as the next @entity12 , failed to erase memories of his nightmare collapse at the same tournament 12 months previously			1
but @entity1 did n't brood			1
he did n't even pick up a club			2
instead the world @entity18 flew to @entity20 for a vacation with his girlfriend , @entity23 tennis star @entity22			1
they holidayed in @entity25 and @entity26			0
and even flew to @entity27 to watch @entity29 's rugby team take on @entity30			0
somehow they found the time to meet @entity34 's @entity33 at a horse racing event			0
@entity36 leaderboard it seems the green was the last thing on @entity1 's mind since that disappointing @entity43 performance			1
but now , as he returns to the @entity45 for this week 's @entity36 -- a tournament he won in 2010 -- @entity1 says taking time out will be the key to his success			1
" i do n't want to be burned out by the time i 'm 30			2
i want to try to prolong my career as much as i can			0
i sometimes take a little bit too much out of myself , especially at the end of the season , " he said on the @entity45 website			1
" i 'm trying to find the perfect balance between golf and having a normal life and everything else			0
for me there 's more to life than just golf			0
i do n't know if people are surprised to hear that , but i have a lot more going on in my life than just golf			2
" @entity1 has reason to be confident at @entity69			1
it was here that he won his first @entity45 title two years ago , shooting 62 in the final round to set a new course record			1
he also became the first player since @entity12 to win a @entity45 event before his 21st birthday			1
" it 's always nice to come back to somewhere where you 've had success , " he said			0
" i 've got great memories of this course and of this tournament from 2010			2
i 've played some great golf here and played not so great golf here last year			2
but i 'm looking forward just to get back out on the course			0
" @entity36 is the first of four tournaments @entity1 will play before launching his @entity5 title defense in june			1
he has drastically cut back his schedule to 23 starts this year -- seven less than 2011			2
but as he argues , it 's all part of the game plan			0
" basically the most important time for me in the golf season is from the start of april until the end of august			0
that 's when all the big tournaments are and that 's when you want to play your best golf , " he said			0
" all the stuff either side of that is more preparation work and making sure that your game is getting ready and your body is physically ready for that time of the year			0
" i know i 've been criticized a little bit for not playing as much as some other guys leading into these few weeks , but i know i 've got a big stretch coming up , and i want to be as fresh as possible for this			0
