@entity0 , @entity1 -- the woman in the photograph 's face is almost entirely covered by an ornate mask - like piece of traditional @entity1 jewelry			1
almost like a niqab , it leaves only her eyes showing			2
perhaps surprisingly , she is also wearing an industrial hard hat and safety jacket , and the photo is called " @entity15			2
" it is one of a series by the @entity1 artist @entity19 commenting on the jobs that @entity1 women do			1
" we have this debate in @entity1 about women 's employment , and some people say women should only work in jobs that ' suit their nature , ' " said @entity22			1
" it 's a completely irrational discussion because who decides what suits their nature ? i started photographing amazing women working in all kinds of jobs to show that the argument is invalid			2
" other photos in the " @entity15 " series feature a @entity1 woman doctor , computer engineer , tv producer , scuba diver , architect and interior decorator , all in similar poses with their faces partly covered			1
@entity22 challenges @entity1 customs in other works too			1
for " @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , " she asked hundreds of women to write their names on wooden balls , which she strung from the ceiling			2
it was her way of breaking taboo that prevents men from saying the names of women in their lives			2
despite the controversial nature of her work , @entity22 says she has had very little negative reaction at home			2
" whenever i do a work , people around me and my galleries get very worried , but in reality there 's incredible room for dialogue in @entity1			1
" these are issues that have been discussed many times , and i 'm just bringing them into contemporary art , " she said			2
@entity22 is one of 17 @entity1 artists featured in the @entity86 exhibition , which this year was shown in @entity0 for the first time after appearing in cities around the world since 2008			1
it is the first major contemporary art exhibition ever shown in @entity1			1
" @entity1 art is absolutely booming , " she said			1
many artists are gently pushing at boundaries and limits of expression in the socially conservative country			1
at @entity86 , @entity99 built a giant ball from 3,600 microphones			2
he wants to place the microphones out on the streets of @entity0 , his home city , for a year to collect people 's random thoughts			0
" in my mind , i was thinking , if i gave a microphone to @entity0 , what would @entity0 say ? " he said			0
" what would it express ? " " you need to talk and engage to get people involved to evolve as a society			0
people are afraid of talk			0
much more , we should be afraid of silence			0
" but , he says , freer expression in @entity1 will come as part of a gradual change			1
" i firmly believe in change			0
but i firmly believe ( in ) change with an essence			0
you want it to be very natural			0
sometimes fast change will affect people wrongly in the region			0
" the edge of @entity1 show came under the banner we need to talk , and was aimed at encouraging dialogue between artists and the community			1
" our aim is to deliver a message , " said curator @entity138 , 36			0
" we want to let the world know what @entity1 is all about , through the eyes of its artists			1
we know that we have a voice that we want people to listen to			0
we have thoughts and experiences to share			0
" beyond @entity86 , there are signs that the art scene is on the up and not afraid to say what it thinks			2

" people are starting to appreciate each other within @entity1 society and the art scene , " she said			1
" if you see something made in @entity1 people relate to it now			1
" it 's very new			0
it 's growing and it 's amazing how fast it 's growing			0
" we are trying to put a positive @entity1 on the map			1
we really want to change the stereotype , and step by step we are doing it			0
" @entity159 's first design was a bag called " daddy i want a @entity186 , " an ironic nod to @entity1 's love of shopping for luxury goods , such as the expensive @entity185			1
her designs are now sold through an online boutique in @entity193 , as well as in nine @entity195 countries			0
she said : " people are pushing the limits , but doing it step - by - step so people do n't get a big shock at once			2
" we do n't have much freedom of expression or freedom of speech , but it 's amazing how people are saying what they want to say through social media and blogs , whether it 's a video , a @entity211 show , an article , a design piece or an artwork			1
" people will always find a way to express themselves			0
it 's human nature to want to say what 's on your mind			0
" if people ca n't express themselves directly , they will do it indirectly			0

" there are a lot of challenges to running a business when you are a girl in @entity1 , " she said			1
" i imagine it would be easier if i could drive , but i 'm proud that i 've achieved so much without			0
" my dad gives me all the permission to travel i need , but it saddens me that some girls have so much potential to creating something , but their families and society are so limiting			0
