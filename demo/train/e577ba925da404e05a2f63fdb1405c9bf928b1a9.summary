-- as the streets of @entity4 and other cities filled with people protesting the non-indictment in the choking death of @entity9 , defenders of the police generally fixated on @entity9 's health			1
because @entity9 was obese , diabetic , asthmatic , suffered from sleep apnea , and had a heart condition , goes the argument , he was somehow to blame for his own death			1
representative @entity15 , @entity16 - @entity4 , for example , went on @entity0 to thank the grand jury for not indicting officer @entity19			0
" you had a 350 - pound person who was resisting arrest			0
the police were trying to bring him down as quickly as possible , " @entity15 said			1
" if he had not had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese , almost definitely he would not have died			0
" @entity15 's comments have been echoed elsewhere , including by many law enforcement commentators on the site , @entity30			0
their comments repeatedly invoke @entity9 's health , saying things such as , " this guy would have died going up a flight of stairs , " " he died because of his preexisting medical conditions , " and " his family should sue @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			1
" what we are seeing in the death of @entity9 and the reaction to the initial exoneration of his killer , is the intersection of racism , fat - hatred ( as discussed by @entity56 ) , and the failure of law enforcement to accommodate disability			1
@entity9 's case is not the first to suffer from these deadly intersections -- the language we 've heard echoes numerous other cases in which police and their defenders blame disability for the results of police violence			1
sadly , it also wo n't be the last , unless we stop letting people use one type of discrimination to defend against another			1
when @entity75 , a man with @entity77 , was allegedly killed by asphyxiation by " off - duty deputies moonlighting as security guards , " @entity75 's disability and weight ended up being blamed			1
their sheriff reportedly said that @entity75 died because of a " medical emergency			0
" the coroner likewise blamed down syndrome and size for the death , and the grand jury did n't indict			0
as with @entity9 , there is some truth to the focus on health , but none of that would have mattered if law enforcement had n't applied pressure to the throat			1
it 's not just physical disability			0
it seems that every time a person with schizophrenia or other psychiatric disabilities gets hurt by law enforcement , the officers justify their actions by explaining that the individual acted in unpredictable ways , was potentially threatening , and so force had to be applied			0
we saw this after the death of @entity113 in @entity114 last august			0
more recently , @entity115 died after allegedly being taken down to the ground by an officer			0
in @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity118 was shot ( but survived )			0
@entity118 and @entity113 both had small knives , were alleged to have known to be in mental - health crisis , and were shot after they reacted to officers entering close proximity			1
in all these cases , patience would likely have saved lives			0
according to the @entity131 with @entity130 ( @entity132 ) , we must all provide " reasonable accommodations " to people with disabilities			2
i have argued before on @entity0 that this principle must be applied by the police even when they want to take people with disabilities into custody			2
in fact , this argument is the core question of @entity145 vs @entity146 , a case that the @entity148 just agreed to hear			2
@entity145 , a woman with psychiatric disabilities , was shot by police in 2008			2
she 's sued under the @entity132 , claiming that her disability was not reasonably accommodated when police charged into her room without backup , got close to her , and then shot her when she did n't immediately comply			2
how the high court rules on the case will shape law enforcement reactions to disability for the foreseeable future			2
i argue that far from exonerating @entity163 , the focus on @entity9 's health merely tries to conceal structural racism under the cloak of ableism			1
it is not " reasonable " to place an unarmed man like @entity9 in a chokehold			1
he was not a threat , he was known to be suffering from health issues , and he was obviously obese			2
yes , without those health issues @entity9 might well have survived , but their presence excuses nothing			1
rather , they reveal the ways in which one form of discrimination intensifies when linked to another			2
when something like @entity9 's death happens , we have to be willing to approach it as an intersection of multiple factors			1
@entity186 does n't excuse racism			0
racism does n't excuse fat - hatred			0
fat - hatred does n't excuse the class - based discrimination			0
rather , they sweep together , enabling us to see patterns of prejudice and their horrific outcomes			0
and when we can see the whole , then we can concentrate on solutions that address them all , such as demanding reasonable accommodations , reforming police procedure , and reinforcing basic civil rights for all @entity131 .			1

@entity204 : defenders of police in @entity9 case have focused on health
one type of discrimination can not be used to defend against another : @entity204
not " reasonable " to place unarmed man like @entity9 in a chokehold , he says
