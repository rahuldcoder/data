dressed in yellow , he stands a foot off the deck of a @entity5 home , and a few feet from the woods			1
everywhere in front of him , there 's fire			1
thankfully , the flames that climb about five feet up backyard trees do n't catch on -- partly because a homeowner wisely trimmed lower branches , in the event of a raging wildfire just like this			2
and thankfully , the man standing his ground is a firefighter -- and he is n't alone , one of hundreds doing what they can to combat and control the @entity23 that had already singed more than 15,000 acres as of friday			1
after a few strategic sprays of water and fire retardant , and a periodic white - out , the scene documented above in a @entity5 fire department video ends by charring the yard almost right up to the hot tub on the deck , but skirting past the home			1
yet for all the happy endings like this one , there are plenty of sad ones : as early saturday , 473 homes had been destroyed , with at least 15 others suffering partial damage			1
the destruction is n't always dictated by rhyme or reason : @entity45 told @entity46 that her home has been spared so far , but her neighbors to the south lost theirs			2
" it just goes to show you how unpredictable these things can be , " she said			2
progress in fighting blaze this is the second time in a year that the @entity5 area has faced a mammoth wildfire			1
last summer 's @entity58 burned down about 350 homes and 18,000 acres			1
some 32,000 evacuated their homes and two people died			2
they can start , and spread , quickly -- with no regard to what 's in their path			2
that 's what happened with the @entity23 after it first flared tuesday afternoon , for still undetermined reasons			1
@entity71 remembered how she , her boyfriend and his family spotted smoke and began mulling the possibility of leaving			0
but that possibility soon turned into a necessity , as the flames rapidly approached			0
" it went from , ' well , we should probably pack and get going , ' to , ' we need to leave right now ' as the smoke started billowing right through the trees on our property			0
" watch : woman records wildfire evacuation the wildfire has been blamed for two deaths			0
in terms of total property lost and damaged , @entity90 spokesman @entity89 told @entity46 earlier this week that it appeared to be the most destructive in state history			0
some 800 personnel are attacking the blaze , and doing it in sweltering heat : temperatures climbed to around 90 degrees friday			1
in addition to those on the ground , multiple @entity99 and @entity100 helicopters and tankers traversed the air as part of the effort			0
authorities spent much of the day friday surveying most of the 7,000 homes they 'd wanted to check to determine which ones made it , which ones did not			0
crews had gained " some tremendous ground " by morning in identifying hotspots and saving structures , county sheriff @entity117 said			1
even so , the blaze was then only 5 % contained			1
friday , though , proved to be a good day			0
skies were at times overcast , temperatures fell somewhat , and there was a strong burst of rain			1
" we got our tails kicked for a couple days , yesterday we saw it as a draw , and ... today we delivered some blows , " @entity117 said			0
those elements and tactical moves left @entity132 , the head of the federal incident management team tackling the blaze , optimistic that crews had turned the corner : they 'd gone from being on the defensive to the offensive , @entity132 said early friday evening , estimating 30 % containment at that point			1
gov. @entity142 was certainly upbeat , after heavy rains doused him friday as he was walking through a " burn area			1
" " i 'm soaking wet and it 's a little chilly , " he said			0
" i do n't think i 've ever been so happy to say that			0
" yet he , @entity132 and citizens affected by the fire -- like @entity149 , who singed his mustache and eyebrows while saving his home but not those of his neighbors -- also stressed that the spurt of heavy rain does n't mean the fight is over			1
" it 's not even enough rain to stop it , " said @entity149 , a retired firefighter			2
" but it can help slow it down a little bit			0
" @entity163 says : ' things are out of our hands ' @entity167 has been living in this area north of @entity5 for 21 years drawn in part by the beauty and peace of the woods			1
" the forest is our friend , " she says			0
@entity167 knows the other side of the equation as well when it comes to living near a forest -- the very real possibility and very real power of wildfires			0
are you there ? send an @entity184 she and her husband @entity186 are among roughly 38,000 people -- from about 13,000 homes over a 93,000 - acre area -- who have been impacted by the @entity23			1
as of midday friday , their home was still standing , though they ca n't breathe easy quite yet : @entity194 noted " the intense heat is less than a quarter - mile away			2
" his wife , @entity196 , admits she 's probably " more worried than i allow myself to think			0
" still , she realizes there 's little she can do at this point beyond trusting in those fighting to save their home and hoping that @entity201 is on her side			2
" things are out of our hands , " she told @entity46			0
" it is what it is			0
" the @entity209 are checking , whenever they can , the official list of homes that have been destroyed and those that have not			1
the @entity23 is n't the only fire affecting @entity214			1
southwest of @entity5 , the @entity217 fire is now 40 % contained after four days in which it scorched more than 3,200 acres -- including a beloved carousel and at least 20 buildings , according to @entity142			1
" it 's burned to a cinder , " he said of the area			2
and the governor has declared a disaster emergency in @entity228 , northwest of @entity229 , due to the @entity230 that 's burned hundreds of acres there			2
yes , @entity233 know wildfires are a fact of life ; yes , they know that their homes could someday burn			0
but that does n't mean dealing with it , in the moment , is easy			0
says @entity241 , who is also in the @entity23 evacuation zone , " it 's been a pretty good emotional roller coaster , trying to understand what is happening			1
" despite the noted progress on that fire , that ride is n't over			2
many have been allowed back in their homes , while others are still being kept			0
and hundreds of firefighters are still out doing what they can to protect people 's property , knowing that a lightning strike or shift of wind can suddenly change everything			0
" it is not a done deal : 30 % is not 100 % , " @entity132 said late friday afternoon			1
" the middle has still got potential			0
