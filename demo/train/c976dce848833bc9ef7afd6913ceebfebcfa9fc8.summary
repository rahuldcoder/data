history not repeating itself in @entity3 " should we have a @entity43 and a willing and committed partner in the @entity3 government , a limited post- 2014 mission focused on training , advising , and assisting @entity3 forces and going after the remnants of core @entity53 could be in the interests of the @entity9 and @entity3 , " the @entity13 said			2
" therefore , we will leave open the possibility of concluding a @entity43 with @entity3 later this year			0
" in his separate statement , @entity57 said he strongly supported the order by @entity1 to " ensure adequate plans are in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the @entity9 not keep any troops in @entity3 after 2014			1

@entity1 , he said , has been very clear that the possibility of @entity9 troops staying in @entity3 depends " on whether we have a bilateral security agreement signed by the @entity3 government , to assure our rights of our troops and other important elements that are required any time @entity9 has troops in another country			1
" @entity28 official : do n't do it a senior @entity28 government official told @entity87 that a full withdrawal of @entity9 troops should not be considered , declaring that " the zero option means civil war in @entity3			2
" speaking on condition of not being identified , the @entity28 official predicted that 30 % of @entity3 forces would desert if @entity9 forces leave the country			0
for the @entity34 , @entity1 's order means preparing for all contingencies			0
" for the first time , the commander in chief has told us to begin planning for a complete withdrawal " from @entity3 , a senior @entity9 official told @entity87			0
while the option to keep troops there remains , the situation has reached a point where the @entity34 has to begin planning for all possibilities , the official added			0

" @entity13 spokesman @entity131 told reporters tuesday that that longer it takes for security agreement to get signed , the more difficult it will be to properly plan and carry out a @entity9 mission after 2014			2
