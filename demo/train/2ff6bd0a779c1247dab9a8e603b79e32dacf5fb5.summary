-- by next fall , @entity1 plans to launch its biggest @entity4 rover yet , the $ 1.8 - billion , @entity6 - size @entity5			1
even though the @entity5 will be able to haul five times as much equipment as the @entity13 rovers that are already on @entity4 , a group of @entity9 researchers say that they could accomplish far more if accompanied by a squad of helper ' bots			1
round robotic sidekicks help @entity1 rovers scout @entity4 territory in this illustration			1
@entity21 , the ceo of @entity23 , and his colleagues have designed the small inflatable scouts to assist bigger , less mobile rovers in their hunt for signs of microbial life on @entity4			1
each foot - wide , 11 - pound ball can roll up to 62 miles , snap photos at any angle , and take soil samples , drawing its power from the solar panels on its shell			1
unlike wheeled rovers , the rounded scouts have fewer motors to repair , never flip over , and are easier to seal from dust			1
plus , they rarely get stuck			0
" the beauty of the system is it needs very little energy to go around rocks , so unless you 're landing on a surface that looks like a bed of nails , it should be fine , " @entity21 says			0
in 2004 , @entity21 helped found @entity9 company @entity50 , whose @entity52 - based @entity51 is now test - patrolling a harbor in @entity54			0
by using @entity51 's pendulum - propulsion mechanism , swapping in a radiation - proof computer , and designing a lightweight , inflatable shell , he thinks he could produce four of the @entity4 balls for as little as $ 6 million			1
" we just need to assemble the bits and pieces and test it , " says @entity21 , who shows his design to @entity1 officials this month			0
more about rolling around the @entity4 inflation : the deflated scouts are stored in boxes aboard the @entity5			2
after landing , a latch opens the box , and a spring inside gently rolls them onto the @entity4 surface			2
this motion triggers a canister of xenon gas inside the ball to release and inflate the scouts before they hit the ground			0
exploration : each ball runs on two solar - powered motors			1
one motor swings a pendulum to move the ball 's center of mass , building forward - or backward - moving momentum			2
to turn , a second motor tilts the pendulum along the main axle -- " the same physics used to fly a helicopter , " @entity21 says			0
the robot can automatically decrease its internal pressure to more easily roll over soft surfaces and patches of sand			0
communication : the autonomous scouts would collect data on the conductivity and age of the @entity4 terrain , take photos , and send information back to the @entity5 and ground control			2
the @entity5 serves as the scouts ' communication hub , receiving and transmitting messages from each ball			0

smaller , round robots could help the next rover *mission* to @entity4
each ball runs on two solar - powered motors
some of the *advantages* *include* not flipping over and fewer motors to repair
