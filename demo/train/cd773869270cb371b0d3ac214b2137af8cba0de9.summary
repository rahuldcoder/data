" afterwards , we went to the restaurant located in the same hotel and it was filled with unemployed professionals sharing their story , from engineers to graphic designers to marketing professionals			1
" @entity22 's saga began in july 2007 when she traded in her job as a corporate compliance officer to attend law school , what she thought would help advance her career			1
