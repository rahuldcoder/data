@entity31 said he wants the inspector general at the @entity37 to investigate the @entity29 staff members ' possible involvement in the controversy that has embarrassed the @entity3 and raised questions about a possible security breach before president @entity44 's trip to @entity45 , @entity5 , for the @entity46 this month			1
acknowledging that the inquiry would be outside the inspector general 's jurisdiction and require @entity44 's invitation , @entity31 said the president should do it to keep his promise to maintain unprecedented openness and transparency in his administration			1
on monday , @entity29 spokesman @entity57 said @entity29 counsel @entity58 conducted an internal review over the weekend and found no wrongdoing by members of the @entity44 advance team in @entity5 ahead of the president 's trip			1
@entity66 chairman @entity65 , @entity67 , scoffed at the idea of an outside inquiry tuesday , saying @entity31 's request was political			2
" i 'm a little frustrated when anybody tries to make politics out of this , " @entity65 said , repeating the words " politics " and " political " multiple times			0
" the fact of the matter is , they 're being totally transparent on this , " @entity65 said of the @entity29			2
based on what he has been told in private briefings , @entity65 said , he saw no evidence that @entity44 staffers who traveled to @entity5 ahead of the president 's arrival behaved inappropriately			1
" there are probably some who are disappointed that the @entity29 is not involved , but having more investigations is not going to find somebody who was involved when nobody was involved , " @entity65 said			1
" let 's get this out of politics			0
we 're talking about the president of the @entity19			0
it is a matter of security ; do n't play politics			0
" homeland security secretary @entity100 will appear before the @entity26 on wednesday at the first congressional hearing since the scandal erupted			0
@entity44 commented on the scandal in an interview tuesday for broadcast on @entity106 's " @entity105 , " saying " 99.9 % " of @entity3 agents do great work and put their lives on the line			1
" so a couple of knuckleheads should n't detract from what they do , but what these guys were thinking , i do n't know , " @entity44 said			1
" that 's why they 're not there anymore			0
" defense secretary @entity121 said tuesday that he has " no tolerance " for the kind of behavior alleged in @entity45 , noting that @entity125 involved in an altercation with prostitutes in @entity128 last year were demoted and punished			0

on monday night , @entity31 sent a letter to @entity58 , asking about how the inquiry was conducted and how the conclusion was reached			2
asked about @entity31 's letter tuesday , @entity57 said he had not seen it			2
in his letter , @entity31 noted that he had asked @entity3 director @entity163 whether any @entity29 advance staffers had been involved but had n't received an answer by monday			1
@entity31 asked for answers to 14 questions , including details of how the @entity29 review was conducted , whether any @entity29 staffers had " overnight guests " and whether any additional room charges were incurred			1
until now , the aftershocks and outrage about the @entity3 scandal were largely bipartisan			1
@entity31 's demands and @entity65 's reaction were the first major signs of a party - line division on the controversy			1
@entity182 chairman @entity181 of @entity183 , an independent who caucuses with @entity184 but often differs with them , said he was satisfied with the @entity187 's internal inquiry			0
" i think there is so much on the line here that this is one of those cases where , if the @entity29 counsel says nobody from the @entity29 staff was involved in this behavior , then i 'm prepared to accept that , " @entity181 said			1
" and if we find out that is n't true , then we 're going to find out about it , and it 's going to be a big mistake by the @entity29 , but i have no reason to doubt what they say			2
" @entity181 said he intends to hold a committee hearing focusing on potential misconduct inside the @entity3 beyond what happened in @entity5			2
" it 's going to be what happened before : whether there was other evidence of misconduct by agents of the @entity3 , " @entity181 said			1
" @entity215 therefore there should have been preventative action taken by the administration of the @entity3 and , finally , what are they going to do now to make sure it does n't happen again ? " since the scandal broke , several whistle - blowers have called his committee with what he called " credible " reports of other incidents similar to @entity5 , @entity181 said			1
he would not provide additional details			0
after he spoke , however , @entity229 spokeswoman @entity228 said @entity181 had misspoke			0
the committee has received a call from just one person who claimed to have information on possible misconduct , but committee staff have yet to talk to that person to determine whether that information is relevant , she said			0
@entity239 chairman @entity238 said tuesday that his committee has heard allegations of similar misconduct by @entity3 agents dating back years			1
like @entity181 , he offered no specifics			0
on monday , officials said a member of the @entity19 military assigned to the @entity247 was under investigation in connection with alleged misconduct in @entity5 , bringing to 12 the total number of military personnel being reviewed			2

it is staffed by members of the military who report through the @entity264			0
while the 11 other military members are being investigated by the @entity268 , it was unclear who would investigate the @entity247 staffer , who has been relieved of his duty with the agency and reassigned to the @entity273 , @entity254 spokesman capt. @entity265 said			0
according to sources , the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at @entity279 in @entity45 , where @entity3 members apparently stayed , flashing their local id cards			2
one of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night , which brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the @entity19 and @entity5			0
that woman has been identified as @entity290 , whose neighbors described her as a 24 - year - old single mother who studies @entity293			0
@entity290 has n't been seen in the neighborhood since the controversy erupted , though a visitor took suitcases from the house recently , they said			0
while soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in @entity5 , military law bars service members from patronizing prostitutes , engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or , for enlisted personnel , conduct " prejudicial to good order and discipline			2
" it is also considered a breach of the @entity3 's conduct code , government sources said			0
@entity1 's @entity314 and @entity315 contributed to this report .			0
