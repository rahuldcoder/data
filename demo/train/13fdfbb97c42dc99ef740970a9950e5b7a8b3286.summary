-- @entity2 's quest for a first grand slam title and her reign as world no. 1 both ended on tuesday after a quarterfinal defeat by defending champion @entity8 at the @entity9			1
four - time grand slam winner @entity8 showed little sign of being hampered by the ankle injury she sustained during her fourth - round win against last year 's runner - up @entity15 as she won 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) in one hour and 45 minutes			1
@entity2 finished the last two seasons top of the world rankings and has been no. 1 seed for the last six majors			1
however , the 21 - year - old @entity20 is now certain to fall below no. 2 @entity21 and no. 3 @entity22 -- who is @entity8 ' semifinal opponent on thursday			1
fourth seed @entity24 , who plays fellow @entity27 @entity26 in the last eight on wednesday , could also take top spot -- a position she , like @entity8 , has held before			1
" @entity8 is very experienced , " @entity2 , who was beaten by @entity8 in her only grand slam final at the @entity32 , told reporters			1
" i mean , she 's a great player			2
of course i really do n't like losing			2
i try to go in and try to win every time i play , but today @entity8 was just that little bit better than me			2
" @entity2 , who could slip to no. 4 in the world depending on @entity24 's results , insisted she is not concerned about losing her top ranking			1
" i start laughing every time because the media talks to me like i 'm finishing my career and i only have one year left and time is running out , " she said			2
" i still have a number of @entity44 and a number of @entity47 opens and @entity48 and @entity46 left			2
" in the end of the day , you can just do your best			0
you ca n't do anything more than that			0
if your best is good enough , that 's great			0
if not , then it 's just too good from the other person			0
i will come back not only once but more times			0
" @entity8 saved four match points in her victory over 2011 @entity62 champion @entity15 and the @entity63 looked as if she might be set for another struggle after letting a 5 - 2 lead slip in the second set			1
but the three - time @entity68 winner rallied to take control of the tie break and advance to her seventh @entity9 semifinal as she beat a no. 1 for the first time in a grand slam			1
having taken more than two years to win her first major title after first reaching the top of the world rankings , the current world no. 14 can sympathize with @entity2 's plight			1
" she 's worked very hard to get to where she is , and she 's one of the most consistent players			0
people are almost in a way almost blaming her for it			0
i think that 's something that is really absurd , " @entity8 said			2
" i think it 's all a matter of experience and improving , definitely improving and trying to learn from losses and become better every slam			2
then she will definitely get there			0
" eleventh seed @entity8 said she had gone to great lengths to ensure her ankle was ready			1
" instead of really focusing on the match you 're focusing on trying to get the ankle as good as possible , " the 28 - year - old said			0
" laying on the couch , every 20 minutes ice , 20 minutes off , 20 minutes ice , 20 minutes off			0
lymphatic drainage , all that stuff			0
" i had a light hit yesterday without really sidewards movement , just trying to get a feel for the ball , and then back to the icing and all that same routine all over again			0
" @entity22 earlier came from behind against @entity111 eighth seed @entity109 before winning 6 - 7 ( 0 - 7 ) 6 - 0 6 - 2			1
it was the 22 - year - old 's 18th victory in her last 21 matches			0
" it was very important to see how i could adjust after not playing really well in the first set , " said the @entity115 , whose only previous grand slam semifinal came at @entity118 last year			1
" i completely turned it around , so i 'm really , really happy about that			0
maybe two years ago i would be like , ' okay it 's not working today			0
' " but today i really tried to forget about the first set and start from zero and really fight hard , take it one at a time and keep going			2
" wednesday 's quarterfinals pit the @entity126 's @entity21 against @entity128 world no. 48 @entity129 and 2008 champion @entity24 against 56th - ranked @entity26 -- who beat five - time @entity9 winner @entity131 in the fourth round .			1

top seed @entity2 loses to @entity8 at the @entity9
@entity2 will lose world no. 1 spot and is still searching for a first grand slam title
defending champion @entity8 to face third seed @entity22 in the semifinals
@entity144 ' @entity22 came from one set down to beat eighth seed @entity109
