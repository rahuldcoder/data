a broad - daylight hatchet assault on a group of @entity3 police officers -- leaving one critically injured with a head wound -- was carried out by a self - radicalized convert to @entity5 in what officials friday termed a terrorist attack			1

" this was a terrorist act , " @entity16 said friday			1
@entity18 converted to @entity5 two years ago and then at some point self - radicalized , @entity26 , the @entity27 's deputy counterterrorism chief , told reporters friday			1
@entity26 said @entity18 was self - directed in his actions , and he had no affiliations with any particular group			2
@entity18 was unemployed , and police said his parents described their son as a depressed recluse who spent much of his time online			2
a common theme in his social media presence was " anti-western , anti-government and in some cases anti-white , " @entity26 said			0
according to police , @entity18 's recent internet activity revealed he had searched for things such as beheadings , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , indicating that " he had been thinking about ( carrying out an attack ) for some time , " said @entity26			2
@entity9 , 28 , was struck in the back of the head			0

" here are four rookie cops , just starting out in their career , when the absolute unexpected happened , " de @entity54 said at a thursday press conference			0
" they responded exactly as their training dictated and ended the situation -- thank @entity76 -- very , very quickly			0
" in the aftermath , some observers questioned if the attack was tied to recent calls by radicals to strike the military and police , especially on the heels of separate attacks on officers in @entity87 earlier this week			1
