-- @entity1 , a @entity2 , @entity3 , computer technician , faces a jury trial in february for allegedly hacking into his then - wife 's e-mail account			1
" she 'd asked me to read her e-mails before , " @entity1 said in an interview this week			1
" she gave me the password before			0
she did n't hide it			0
" @entity1 says the e-mails revealed that @entity13 , who has been married three times , was having an affair with her second husband			1
@entity1 , the third husband , shared the documents with his wife 's first husband , who then used them to file an emergency motion to obtain custody of his son with @entity13			1
@entity1 said he and the first husband were both concerned because , according to @entity1 , husband @entity25 had a prior arrest on a domestic violence charge			1
" he took action with the courts to have himself protected and i took action with the court to have my daughter protected , " @entity1 said			1
when @entity13 learned how the e-mails made their way into court , she complained to police			2
@entity39 , @entity3 , prosecutor @entity40 used a state anti-hacking law to charge @entity1 with a felony			1
@entity43 did not immediately respond to @entity0 calls for comment , but the @entity46 published a voice - mail from her			2
" the guy is a hacker , " @entity43 told the newspaper			0
" it was password protected , he had wonderful skills , and was highly trained			0
then he downloaded them and used them in a very contentious way			0
" the @entity3 statute forbids someone from accessing " a computer program , computer , computer system or computer network " to acquire property " without authorization			2
" @entity66 criminal defense lawyer @entity65 said all 50 @entity68 states have such laws , but he called this " a highly unusual use of a criminal statute			2
" the laws are typically used to prosecute " some technological guy who 's broken into a company 's computer system and damaged it or stolen something , " @entity65 said			0
@entity1 's defense lawyer agreed			1
" i find it so hard to believe that our legislature would enact a law and say ' you know what , if husbands and wives are reading each others ' e-mail , that 's a priority for us and we 've got to stop that , ' " attorney @entity79 said			2
@entity1 said his decision to peek into his wife 's e-mail account was like someone kicking in a door to save someone from a burning house			1
" do you kick the door open or do you let it burn ? " @entity1 said			2
" i did what i felt was absolutely necessary			0
" @entity13 responded in a written statement submitted by her attorney , saying " @entity1 is not the saint portrayed in the media			1
" " if you believe news reports you would think he was the faithful husband looking to protect my children			0
nothing could be farther from the truth , " she said			0
the couple 's divorce was finalized earlier this month			0
@entity0 's @entity113 contributed to this report .			0
