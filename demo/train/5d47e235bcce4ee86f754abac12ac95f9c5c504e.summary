@entity0 , @entity1 -- governors of several @entity1 states have warned that recent oil spills and other contamination could be polluting local drinking water			1
but president @entity8 counters that the officials ' criticisms and media reports on the water controversy are propaganda in the political battle against him			1
" if it is n't war , it is media terrorism			1
it is an attack on the physical and mental health of a people , of a community			0
this is a crime , " @entity8 said this week , saying authorities should prosecute those responsible			2
on thursday , @entity1 's attorney general said a court had issued an injunction requiring media to " act with extreme responsibly " and present evidence when broadcasting information about the country 's water , saying that past reports on contamination were presented without proof in order to cause panic			1
" they have no technical evidence			0
they are doing it to foster negative opinions , not to help the population			0
if you say something is happening and it is untrue , what can you generate ? conflict and chaos , " attorney general @entity49 said			1
critics say the government should analyze what could be causing drinking water problems , rather than investigating those who have expressed concerns			1

the governor has said public health is his primary concern			2

@entity76 has been at the center of the political and environmental controversy over the water supply since last month , when an oil pipeline ruptured in the @entity98 , which runs through his state			2
federal officials have said @entity1 's state oil company has cleaned up 95 % of the oil that flowed into the river , and the water in the area is safe to drink			1
but the governor repeatedly expressed concerns over the drinking water supply , and another rupture emerged in public view -- this time within the ranks of @entity8 's @entity113			1
last week , party leaders expelled @entity76 " for willing , serious offenses derived from unethical and counter-revolutionary positions , " state media reported			2
