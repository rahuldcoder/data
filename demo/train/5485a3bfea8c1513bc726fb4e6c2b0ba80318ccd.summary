@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 1960 in @entity4			1
five heads of state sign on the dotted line to alter the course of energy for decades to come			0
wednesday , as the @entity12 oil cartel celebrates its 50th anniversary , its 12 members sit atop just more than three quarters of the world 's proven oil reserves -- more than 1 trillion barrels of crude			1
while there has not been any independent verification of that number , @entity12 's secretary - general says it is something for which global markets can plan			1
" a trillion plus -- the reserve is very , very accurate , " @entity25 told @entity2 , ahead of the regular thursday meeting of the @entity12			1
" we know the numbers ; we put this number in our data			0
we distribute the numbers and we are sure that our proven reserves are more than a trillion			2
" with oil recently hitting a five - month high of $ 83 a barrel , the @entity0 meeting is less about setting a target price and more about compliance with production quotas and future planning			1
the former has always been a challenge , since the 12 members try to jockey for market share and fill their domestic coffers when prices are historically high			2
according to @entity12 estimates , compliance by member states is running at about 57 percent , well below the 80 - percent level in the spring of 2009			1
it 's because as the economy recovers , there has been more demand for oil , so @entity12 members produce above their assigned allocations			1
@entity12 updated its daily global demand for crude this week ahead of the gathering , saying it will average 85.59 million barrels a day this year for a gain of just 1.3 percent on the year before			1
the year 2011 is not a great deal more promising , with @entity12 saying demand will rise only 1.2 percent next year			1
these numbers are nearly in line with those from the @entity68			0
so in this tepid recovery scenario , ministers are not eager to rock the boat			2
if they can keep oil prices in the range of $ 70 - 85 a barrel , where they have been for the better part of a year , their priorities for domestic infrastructure development can be met without stifling global growth			1
according to the @entity81 in @entity82 , in the current pricing scenario , the 12 @entity12 member states will bring in $ 625 billion dollars this year , again historically high for the cartel			1
the challenge is not so much now , but in the medium term			0
ministers here are talking about spare capacity -- basically the ability to produce more oil when demand justifies such action			1
that demand is not expected in the next 18 months , but certainly in the next two to three years , because of the growth of @entity96 and , less so , @entity97			0
most of the spare capacity today sits in @entity100 , which led a drive to take 4.2 million barrels off the market in the autumn of 2008 , when prices went from $ 147 down to $ 33			2
it is not clear , here at @entity12 's new headquarters and within the lobbies of the hotels where the delegates are staying , that members are re-investing at a pace to respond to the potential challenge in the near term			1
in the medium term , there is also the serious issue of in - fighting between long - term rivals @entity120 and @entity121			0
on october 4 , @entity121 upgraded its reported proven reserves to 143 billion barrels -- a sudden rise of 24 percent			2
long neglected under the rule of @entity126 and sanctions that targeted the energy sector , oil exploration in @entity121 suffered immensely over the past two decades			0
@entity121 has aspirations to challenge @entity100 over the next decade and produce 12 million barrels a day			0
one week after @entity121 's declaration , @entity120 upped the stakes and said that its own proven reserves suddenly surged 9 percent , to just more than 150 billion barrels -- not by accident higher than @entity121			0
as one veteran oil executive said here during a conversation , this verbal jostling is " silly and lacks credibility			0
" the face of @entity12 for more than a quarter of a century , sheikh @entity141 , @entity100 's oil minister from 1962 to 1986 , suggested an independent third party analysis of @entity12 's reserves			1
" we have to make a study by some people outside the countries you 've mentioned , " @entity141 told @entity2 at his home near @entity147 , @entity148			0
" i do n't know whether they exaggerated or they did not			0
i want , i need a neutral ( analysis )			0
" during @entity141 's time and through the mid- 1990s , the in - fighting within @entity12 was legendary			2
member states would convene at top hotels in all corners of the world with displays of wealth and meetings that could last a week or longer			2
that era has passed , and at 50 , the institution is much more business - like with meetings lasting no more than a day			0
after its hard - fought gains over the past decade to provide some predictability , many here hope that some within the organization do n't go back to their previous ways .			0
