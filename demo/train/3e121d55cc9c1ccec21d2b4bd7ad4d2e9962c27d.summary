-- there 's nothing like getting stuck into a good book -- but getting stuck in a good book store is a different matter			1
just ask @entity6 , a tourist from @entity7 who was inadvertently locked inside a @entity9 retailer for several hours , after strolling in minutes before the store was closing			1
@entity6 , from @entity11 , entered the @entity13 store near @entity9 's @entity14 on thursday evening to use the store 's @entity15			1
" i walked into the store about five minutes before 9 p.m. , " he told the @entity19 's @entity18 television network			0
" i walked in right past employees and i needed to use the internet ... i peeked up on the second floor and saw there were chairs and a table up there so i walked up there and was using the internet for 10 or 15 minutes and all the lights were on upstairs			0
" i get ready to leave and i walk down and it 's completely dark and the doors were locked			0
" @entity6 said despite setting an alarm off by trying to open the doors and speaking to a security guard and police via telephone , no one came to his aid			2
after several hours of waiting , he took to social media to broadcast his plight , posting on @entity44 and @entity45			1
as his messages were retweeted thousands of times , a @entity13 employee spotted them and secured his release			0
the bookstore posted its own @entity44 message shortly afterward , announcing : " we 're pleased to announce that @ @entity56 _ is a free man once more			0
thanks for your concern and tweets ! " after three hours in captivity , @entity6 followed that with his own @entity44 declaration : " i 'm free "			1
