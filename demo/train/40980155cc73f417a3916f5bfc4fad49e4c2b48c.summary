-- you had to feel sorry for the home team when host country @entity3 got trounced 7 - 1 by @entity5 in their @entity7 final match on tuesday			1
if you 're @entity8 , it was open season on the hapless squad , and the more brutally funny you were about the shocking blowout , the better			0
we 've rounded up some of our favorites , but are sure we did n't see them all			0
if you saw a particularly successful shot on goal -- and there was no shortage of those tuesday -- share it with us in the comments below			0
our favorite zings centered around a few themes ( out of appreciation for our @entity25 friends , no @entity27 material will be included , though there was plenty )			2
they included ... straight - up trash talk @ @entity35 how do you say , " @entity3 got their ass kicked " in @entity34 ? @ @entity38 the destruction of the @entity37 is complete			1
# @entity39 @ @entity5 gets 10 goals , everyone in the stadium gets a free taco			1
# worldcup ‏ @ @entity46 in dog goals , it 's 49 - 0 @ rustyrockets they 'll have 5 mins added on for the time @entity49 has spent picking the ball out of the net			0
@ psmith if only there was a @entity25 word for schadenfreude pop culture references @ jearle " @entity3 , the @entity57 send their regards			1
@ mickmcavoy the last time i saw a @entity3 this bleak it was getting directed by @entity62 @ @entity63 ‏ this seems like the right time to use the classic " @entity66 down the opposing teams ' pants and then run back to the bus and split " play			0
@ darthrachel it 's ok @entity3 , you still have a chance if you catch the snitch ! @entity76			2
web and tech culture ‏ @entity80 # bra you wo n't believe what happened @entity82			0
‏ @ justinrood i just took the poll , which @entity25 goal against @entity3 are you ? i 'm # 6 ! @ lfrum is @entity3 's controller plugged in ? check the batteries ? # @entity88 @ ditzkoff at 7 goals , the @entity7 scoreboard just goes to the @entity93 kill screen one ( sarcastic ) silver lining @ bjnovak and the saddest part is there 's probably no fun ways to cheer yourself up in @entity3 opinion : why weeping @entity3 fans applauded @entity5 's team tears , puns and a @entity8 record			1

@entity3 's *stunning* loss to @entity5 in @entity7 inspired a *flood* of *tweets*
they range from *standard* sports trash talk to pop culture references
