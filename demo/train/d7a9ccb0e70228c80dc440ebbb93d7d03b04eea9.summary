@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 arrived in @entity1 , she had only her doctor and security man with her			1
the rest of her entourage had gone on ahead to establish operations around the country for what is proving to be a whirlwind and exceptionally busy trip			2
it began this morning in the blistering heat of @entity16 , the center of @entity1 's fishing and seafood industry , a nondescript town of canneries and fish markets			1
by the time we arrived , a couple of hours before @entity4 was due , the two stopping - off points of her trip were already thick with thousands of @entity28 waiting to catch a glimpse of the @entity28 opposition leader , who is making her first trip outside the country in more than 20 years			1
@entity28 migrant workers dream of return home at the fish market , with not a breath of wind and a powerful smell of shrimp in the air , they waited patiently , clutching flags and pictures of @entity4 and her father , former prime minister @entity44 , the man who liberated what was then known as @entity28 from @entity47 rule			1
when she arrived it was chaos			2
@entity4 was not expected to get out of the car -- her people had been told it may be too dangerous because of the crowds -- but she did anyway , to the delight of her compatriots			1
at the community center nearby the crowds were much bigger , thousands strong , and chanting her name and singing the national anthem			2
young men , women and families mingled , laughed and sweat under the searing sun. when she arrived she initially could not get out of the car because of the crowds and was taken down a side alley where she could get into the community center			0
moments later , to an ecstatic crowd , she appeared on a third - floor balcony to tell her supporters that she would not forget them and that she would fight for their rights			0
the effect was electric as her words hit home			0
many smiles turned to tears of joy -- such is the hope these @entity28 migrants have of returning to their homeland and a job			1
inside , @entity4 spoke to community leaders and workers			1
each told a story of the trials they faced			0
after 40 minutes it was time to move on , to return to the capital and a busy schedule of meetings			0
she spoke to the media only briefly , saying she would not take questions but instead outlining what she had heard from her people			0
her commanding presence in an outdoor public arena is only amplified inside a room			0
in all , her visit lasted just about three hours			0
not long , but long enough to send a very clear message that her new - found travel freedom will be used to push democracy and human rights for @entity28 harder than ever			1
@entity4 will be back in @entity105 by the end of the week			2
next stop , @entity107 .			0
