-- a new strain of avian flu that jumped from birds to mammals is responsible for the death of more than 160 seals off the @entity9 coast last year , scientists announced tuesday			1
the virus could theoretically pose a threat to human health , they said			1
harbor seals -- most of them babies less than 6 months old -- began appearing with severe pneumonia and skin lesions in september of last year , the researchers said			2
over the next few months , at least 162 dead seals were recovered along the coast from @entity20 to @entity21 , they said			1
mutant bird flu would be airborne , scientists say testing pointed at a new strain of the @entity27 flu virus being called seal @entity27			1
" when initial tests revealed an avian influenza virus , we asked the obvious question : how did this virus jump from birds to seals ? " lead researcher @entity32 of @entity33 said			2
the virus developed the ability to attack mammalian respiratory tracts , scientists learned			2
it may also have developed enhanced virulence and transmission in mammals , they said , but they need to do more tests to be sure			0
avian flu has spread to humans before , most notably h1n1 and @entity47 , so the new strain could pose a threat to public health , scientists warned			1
" @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and influenza are all examples of emerging infectious diseases that originated in animals , " said @entity51 , director of the @entity52 at @entity33			0
" any outbreak of disease in domestic animals or wildlife , while an immediate threat to wildlife conservation , must also be considered potentially hazardous to humans , " he said			0
the research is published in the journal @entity70			0
it was carried out by scientists from the @entity73 at @entity33 's @entity74 , the @entity75 , @entity76 , the @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
