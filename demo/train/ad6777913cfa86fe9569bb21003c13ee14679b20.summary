1895 -- @entity28 discovers x-ray radiation , which makes the detection of tumors in the body much easier and non-invasive			1
later in 1899 , tage @entity34 becomes the first person to successfully treat cancer with x-rays			2
1896 -- removal of the ovaries is performed for the first time to treat breast cancer			2
1898 -- @entity43 and @entity44 discover radium and later use it to treat tumors			2
1900 -- @entity47 cures a patient with skin cancer using small doses of daily radiation therapy			1
this technique is later referred to as fractionated radiation therapy			1
1900s -- dr. @entity55 invents the pap smear test after his findings suggest that vaginal cell smears reveal the presence of cancer			2
1943 -- the first electron linear accelerator is designed for radiation therapy			1
today , it is widely used for treatment of cancer			2

they go on to win the @entity91 in 1984			1
1976 -- @entity92 and @entity93 discover oncogene , a gene that , when mutated or expressed at high levels , helps turn a normal cell into a cancer cell			0
they win the 1989 @entity91			1
1980s -- anti-nausea drugs are developed to suppress the side effects of chemotherapy			1
1991 -- the @entity104 human genome project begins			0
the first gene transfers in humans also take place in that same year			0
1998 -- @entity108 , a drug that helps reduce the risks of breast cancer by half in women is approved for wide use by the @entity115 ( @entity115 )			0

this is the only drug approved for liver cancer			0
