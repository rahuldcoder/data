-- @entity1 avenged her 2009 @entity3 defeat against @entity4 when beating the unseeded @entity5 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 3 in a gripping quarterfinal			1
@entity4 lifted the trophy at @entity3 in 2009 but was unable to repeat her success despite breaking the world no. 1 's serve for the first time in the tournament			1
@entity1 cruised to the first set in 28 minutes but that was an inaccurate barometer of what was to come , with the remainder of the match taking an hour and a half			2
despite @entity4 taking an early break in the third set , @entity1 found another level to reach the @entity3 semifinals for the first time since 2003			1
the 31 - year - old may have 15 grand slams to her name but she will be conscious that only one of those came in @entity28 , back in 2002 when beating sister @entity29 in the final			1
" i was so determined to get through that match , and i really , really , really wanted it more than anyone , i think , " she told reporters afterwards			0
" i was really just fighting , giving it everything i had out there			0
i 've been able to come back a lot throughout my career			0
i do n't think anything really changed			0
" @entity41 extended @entity1 ' record winning streak to 29 matches , a run that has only been bettered by her sister @entity29 ( 35 ) and @entity47 's @entity46 ( 32 ) this century			1
she will face @entity50 fifth seed @entity48 in the semifinal after last year 's runner - up continued her fine form at @entity3 when beating fourth seed @entity54 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 )			1
the victory was @entity48 's first against a player ranked in the top five and now she must beat @entity1 for the first time if she is to return to the final , where she was beaten by @entity61 last year			1
former champion @entity62 , who won the @entity3 three times between 1990 - 1992 , believes @entity48 's chances are slim			1
" i think @entity1 is playing the best clay court tennis of her life , " she told @entity0			2
" i think that having a tough match like she did today , when she played three sets , will only make her stronger			2
she 's also as focused as i 've ever seen her			0
" @entity1 may have lost in the first round in @entity28 last year but she has dominated the women 's game since -- winning @entity72 , the @entity74 singles and doubles , the @entity76 and the @entity77			1
after paying tribute to @entity4 , who came into @entity3 ranked no. 39 after missing the second half of last year with a knee injury , @entity1 turned her attentions to an opponent against whom she boasts a 5 - 0 record			1
" @entity4 played very well , " she said after her toughest match of the championships			2
" she 's such a great player			0
she 's taken a little time off due to injury , but she 's been consistent , at least in the slams			0
" she has won this tournament before so i am happy to get through such a tough match			0
it was very difficult and i am very tired			0
" against @entity48 , it will be another tough match , she 's a great fighter			1
" @entity48 is now through to her third grand slam semifinal , having also made the last four at the @entity76 last year			1
having finally ended a run of 28 matches against players ranked in the top five , she is now hoping that @entity1 ' relative lack of success may count in her favor			2
" it 's going to be very difficult because she 's very strong , and physically she 's an incredible athlete , " @entity48 said			2
" she has a lot of power and it 's never easy to play against her			0
but maybe clay is a bit better than the other surfaces for me			0
" on wednesday , defending champion @entity61 takes on @entity111 and @entity112 faces @entity113 in the remaining quarterfinals .			0
