@entity0 -- the @entity2 passed a slightly altered health care " fixes " bill thursday night , completing legislative action on president @entity8 's top domestic priority			1
the so - called " fixes " bill , approved by a 220 - 207 vote , now goes to @entity8 to be signed into law			1
it makes changes in the broader health care reform measure that @entity8 enacted tuesday			1
approval by both the @entity2 and @entity17 on thursday concluded a tortuous legislative struggle for the health care reform legislation , which received no @entity21 support in any of the major votes in either chamber dating back to last year			1
how will health reform affect you ? " this is a very proud night in the history of this @entity31 , " @entity2 majority leader @entity26 told reporters , adding he expected @entity8 to sign the measure next week			1
thursday 's vote " completes the process of a bill that has been in the making literally for a century , and certainly for decades , " said @entity26 , @entity32			1
the " fixes " bill also included provisions to shift government funding for student loans away from commercial banks to new education initiatives			2
until now , commercial banks have received federal subsidies for student loans			0
earlier thursday , @entity17 @entity21 forced two minor provisions involving the student loan funding to be stripped from the bill -- changes that required the @entity2 to take up the bill a second time but had no effect on the broader health care bill that took effect tuesday			1
a @entity57 memo said the violations raised by @entity21 senators involved @entity61 grant spending that wo n't immediately affect the federal budget , and therefore was ineligible for inclusion in the measure			2
that 's because the measure was being passed under reconciliation rules , which apply only to budget - related measures			2
after the changes , the @entity17 approved the bill on a 56 - 43 vote to send it to the @entity2 a second time			1
on sunday , the @entity2 passed both the overall health care bill and the accompanying fixes bill as part of a complicated legislative process necessary to overcome unanimous @entity21 opposition			1
republicans used every parliamentary tool available to try to undermine both the overall health care bill and the fixes measure			1
they forced the @entity17 to begin deliberations on a series of proposed amendments starting wednesday night			2
the @entity17 did not adjourn until 2:45 a.m. thursday			2
the @entity17 reconvened at 9:45 a.m. to consider additional @entity21 proposals which , among other things , were designed to force @entity87 to cast unpopular votes in the run - up to november 's midterm elections			1
the @entity87 ' fixes bill was necessary to get a reluctant @entity2 to pass the @entity17 's health care reform measure unchanged			1
if there had been any changes to that initial bill , it would have had to go back to the @entity17 for another vote , which almost certainly would have failed			1
since a special election earlier this year in which @entity87 lost the @entity17 seat formerly held by sen. @entity102 , the party has not had enough votes to overcome a @entity21 filibuster			1
that situation prompted the two - bill strategy @entity87 are using			2
after passing the @entity17 bill without changes , @entity2 @entity87 passed the fixes bill sunday to alter provisions they did not like			1
because the bill was being handled under the reconciliation rules in the @entity17 , only 51 votes were needed for passage			2
the compromise package added more than $ 60 billion to the overall plan 's cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle - and lower - income families			0
specific provisions included : closing the @entity122 prescription drug " doughnut hole " by 2020			0
under current law , @entity122 stops covering drug costs after a plan and beneficiary have spent more than $ 2,830 on prescription drugs			0
it starts paying again after an individual 's out - of - pocket expenses exceed $ 4,550			0
senior citizens stuck in the doughnut hole this year will receive a $ 250 rebate			0
raising the threshold for imposing the so - called " @entity137 " tax on expensive health insurance plans to coverage valued at more than $ 10,200 for individuals and $ 27,500 for families			0
the tax wo n't kick in until 2018			0
imposing an additional 3.8 percent @entity122 payroll tax on investment income for individuals making more than $ 200,000 a year and couples making more than $ 250,000 a year			0
eliminating a special exemption for the state of @entity147 from all new @entity149 expenses -- known as the " @entity150			0
" the federal government will instead assist every state by picking up 100 percent of the costs of expanded @entity149 coverage between 2014 and 2016 , and 90 percent starting in 2020			0
reducing the fine for individuals who do not purchase coverage from $ 750 to $ 695			0
increasing the fine on large companies failing to provide health coverage for workers from $ 750 to $ 2,000 per employee			0
the compromise package would add more than $ 60 billion to the overall plan 's cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle - and lower - income families			0
it also would expand @entity122 's prescription drug benefit while scaling back the bill 's taxes on expensive insurance plans			2
among the @entity21 amendments to the fixes bill defeated by @entity87 were a provision to eliminate new penalties being imposed on businesses whose workers use federally subsidized insurance			1
in addition , sen. @entity181 , @entity182 , proposed that drugs for erectile dysfunction , such as @entity186 and @entity187 , be prohibited to sex offenders , and sen. @entity189 , @entity190 , sought to strike so - called " sweetheart deals , " such as an extra $ 300 million in medicaid funds for @entity193			0
@entity21 are " not serious about helping this bill , " senate majority leader @entity194 , @entity195 , said wednesday			2
they are concerned only with " throwing roadblocks in front of anything we do			0
" republicans raised points of order against the fixes bill on two provisions , and the @entity17 parliamentarian ruled them legitimate			1
@entity87 lacked the 60 votes necessary to override the ruling			0
@entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
