@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 is unable to explain images of what witnesses took to be a high - altitude rocket launched off the coast of @entity1 at sunset monday , officials said			1
but @entity11 , a defense expert who is director of @entity12 , said he believes he has solved the mystery			1
" it 's clearly an airplane contrail , " @entity11 said tuesday afternoon			1
" it 's an optical illusion that looks like it 's going up , whereas in reality it 's going toward the camera			2
the tip of the contrail is moving far too slowly to be a rocket			2
when it 's illuminated by the sunset , you can see hundreds of miles of it ... all the way to the horizon			1
" why the government is so badly organized that they ca n't get somebody out there to explain it and make this story go away			0
... i think that 's the real story , " @entity11 added			2
" i mean , it 's insane that with all the money we are spending , all these technically competent people , that they ca n't get somebody out there to explain what is incredibly obvious			2
" a @entity43 @entity42 official who did n't want to be identified said the contrail could very well be from an airplane			2
an " illusion " effect made the contrail appear as if it 's rising straight up , but it 's actually level , the official said			1
the event is similar to another sighting around @entity50 in which observers believed they witnessed a missile , he said			0
col. @entity53 , a spokesman for the @entity4 , said later tuesday that while there is no evidence that the contrail was left by a missile the department is still investigating			1
no @entity4 units reported launches at the time			1
the @entity61 and the @entity42 did not report any foreign missile launches off the @entity1 coast , @entity53 added			1
regardless , there was no threat to the @entity43 , he said			0
tuesday morning , the @entity4 and the @entity61 were investigating video shot by a news helicopter operated by @entity2 affiliate @entity69 / @entity70 showing an ascending orange - colored contrail high into the atmosphere , officials said			1
a contrail is the visible vapor trail behind airplanes or rockets traveling at high altitudes			1
the @entity78 , the @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity1 reps			0
@entity83 and @entity84 -- whose coastal districts are closest to the offshore contrails -- were at a loss to explain the images			0
" the @entity78 ran radar replays of a large area west of @entity0 based on media reports of the possible missile launch at approximately 5 p.m. ( pt ) on monday			1
the radar replays did not reveal any fast moving , unidentified targets in that area , " said @entity78 spokesman @entity93			0
" the @entity78 did not receive reports ... of unusual sightings from pilots who were flying in the area on monday afternoon			1
" the @entity78 did not approve any commercial space launches around the area monday , " he added			2
@entity53 said that various agencies are trying to find out what happened			0
" i do n't know specifically what they are all doing			0
i just know they have been pinged and that we are talking to the @entity78 , we are talking to other parts of the @entity43 government			0
we are trying to do everything we can to figure out if anybody has any knowledge of what this event may have been , " @entity53 said in off - camera comments to journalists			0
" so far we have come up empty , " he added			0
@entity2 's @entity119 and @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
