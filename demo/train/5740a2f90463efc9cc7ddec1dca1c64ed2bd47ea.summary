ask 100 robotics scientists why they 're inspired to create modern - day automatons and you may get 100 different answers			1
for a team at @entity6 , it 's termites			1
" not the ones around here that destroy buildings , but the ones on other continents that build ... mounds more than 40 feet tall , " said @entity7 , a staff scientist at @entity6 's @entity8			1
" somehow , all of them working together can build these large - scale , complicated things			2
" the @entity6 team members have created their own set of simple robots that they 're trying to teach to emulate those termites			1
the result , so far , of the @entity21 is a squad of autonomous robots that can be instructed to build towers , castles and pyramids out of foam bricks , then successfully negotiate their way around the things they create			1
it 's part of a movement called " swarm robotics , " and it 's pretty much the opposite of all the @entity36 and @entity37 that we 've grown up with in the science - fiction realm			1
" typically , when you think of robotics , you think of one human - like , complicated robot , " said @entity40 , an academic fellow who spearheaded the design and construction of the @entity21 robots			1
" instead , in swarm robotics , we 're looking at large numbers of simple ones			1
rather than a robot being like a human , it 's more like a bunch of robots that are like an ant colony			0
" or , you know , a termite colony			0
@entity58 and @entity7 said they both had independently thought about emulating mound - building termites , which live mainly in @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
read : 10 pop - culture robots that shaped the future the team has gone to @entity67 twice to study the termites there and plans a third visit			1
the scientists say the current @entity21 robots are a basic version of what they 'd like to create once they have a better idea of how millions of termites work together on a single , massive project , sometimes long after the insects who started the construction are dead			1
the team 's robots take cues from each other based on which parts of the job have already been finished			2
so , when one robot leaves , say , a brick in a particular location , that tells the next robot what needs to be done next			0
" the power 's in the swarm , " @entity58 said			0
" the power is in not having a single point of failure because you have this one really advanced robot			0
the power is in sending out a bunch of robots that are really simple and hoping that some of them will succeed			2
" that 's a key difference between @entity21 and other swarm projects			2
many others work more like an ant colony or beehive , with a single " queen " giving instructions to a team of underlings			0
in the long run , @entity7 said , the @entity21 system could be used on projects " where we want construction done , but we do n't want people to be the ones to do it			2
" that could be scenarios where it 's difficult , expensive or dangerous to use human crews			0
" if we wanted to have a @entity130 base and we could send a team of robots on ahead to build the habitat first , that 's obviously a big advantage for the human astronauts who would show up later , " he said			2
of course , the team acknowledges that such lofty goals are a long way off			0
but in the nearer term , the scientists can see termite - inspired swarm robots being used for tasks like building dikes and piling sandbags during floods , keeping humans out of harm 's way			1
" if some of them get swept away by rising waters , none of the others need even take notice , " @entity7 said			0
" they do n't have to do anything differently			0
" added @entity58 : " we 're not intending to replace humans			0
we 're intending to work in situations where humans ca n't work or it 's impractical for them to work			0

@entity6 *researchers* create " swarm robotics " construction crew
small , simple robots work together to build structures
the @entity21 project is based on mound - building termites
creators say swarm robots could do dangerous jobs like build *levies* in floods
