-- destructive graffiti wars are being waged by anonymous vandals , deliberately defacing many of the meticulously painted murals that vividly illustrate @entity6 's streets			1
the attacks have sparked calls by outraged professional artists and their supporters demanding everything from public humiliation to experimental collaboration with the hostile graffiti " taggers " to avoid violence and more lost art. if you 're going to @entity6 , keep in mind that the outdoor murals you see are ephemeral , so appreciate them -- and take lots of photos -- before they disappear			1
countless gorgeous , larger - than - life murals illustrate this city 's weathered exteriors , bestowing visual intrigue to homes , shops , parking lots , recreational facilities , derelict buildings and alleys			1
artistic themes include anarchy , surrealism , science fiction , eroticism and other fantasies and realities			0
some gigantic paintings include political slogans or poetry for the public to ponder			0
now , however , a rolling population of taggers has been wreaking havoc on many of the best murals , by hurriedly spray - painting initials , names , words , acronyms and other lettering across the majestic urban displays			1
gang intimidation at work some victimized artists worry that the taggers may include criminal gangs marking their neighborhoods , making it unwise to confront them or remove their destructive scrawls			0
" there is always that possibility of violence , if you approach someone tagging a mural , " said @entity65 , 26 , who teaches art at @entity6 's @entity67			1
" some taggers come in large numbers , some are gang related			0
their intention is to mess things up and possibly look for a fight , " he said in an interview			0
" i can only hope taggers would appreciate the street arts , and truly see what are the possibilities that we are building , for artists to showcase their talents in public space , " said @entity65 , who is also a muralist , painter , street and studio artist			1
@entity95 art targeted @entity96 , the @entity95 neighborhood 's prestigious , free , open - air gallery , is n't immune from desecration			1
since 1992 , @entity96 's urban lane has allowed artists to voluntarily adorn its outdoor walls , fences , residences , gutters and every other available space with fanciful and often profound murals			1
the public alley runs parallel between 17th and 18th streets , linking @entity95 and @entity111 streets -- you can visit anytime day or night for free			1
prominent artist @entity113 completed his 12 - foot - tall , 15 - foot - wide , ant - infested " @entity115 " @entity96 mural in 2013			1
his mural portrays a man 's huge turquoise head -- resembling himself -- laying on the ground , " with two factions of ants battling it out in front of his very eyes , representing the sort of narcissism associated with all the latest social media gadgets , as well as the individual 's helplessness in the face of conflicts either nearby or globally , " he said in an interview			2
@entity113 was n't amused when his masterpiece was defaced in july			2
big , bold blobs of silver - colored letters , outlined in red -- spelling the name " @entity138 " -- suddenly smothered much of the mural			2
asked what punishment anti-mural taggers should suffer , @entity113 suggested perhaps the person should be " tarred and feathered , and tied to the defaced wall for a few days and nights ? spray - paint their faces ? " compromising with taggers ? @entity113 , whose signature " @entity150 ! ? " includes double punctuation , has seen his art attacked by other taggers in the past			1
his previous response was to painstakingly paint over the graffiti , and restore his mural			1
this time , however , @entity113 painted fresh chaotic designs over parts of the silvery letters , rendering " @entity138 " unrecognizable under blossoming , newly evolved weird images			0
" my response this time is to collaborate with my tagger , and not return the piece to its original state , but see what happens , " said @entity113 , 50 , while laboring to repair his mural			1
" the tags inspire new visual vocabularies i would not have thought to paint , had the piece not been tagged			2
" tagger response : " its war " in august , " @entity138 " returned with a vengeance to @entity96 and ominously wrote in black letters across the repaired mural : " this isnt @entity177			1
" " i wish you could get ahold of @entity138 , my tagger - collaborator , but i 've no idea who , where , what , he is , " @entity113 lamented after the fresh assault			2
@entity113 's @entity186 friends analyzed the tagger 's motive			2
" you could think of it in terms of mental illness			0
it 's @entity194 's -- but they have to write their name over and over maybe , " posted one colleague			0
" he is expressing some sort of superiority -- read : ' internalized inferiority ' -- over a real artist			2
i was just marveling at the tags on the toilet seat at a local establishment			2
how low do you have to be , to want to tag that ? " someone else wrote			2
" i really just do n't get why he has chosen to target @entity113 of all people			0
a legendary , grimy , old school mission dude , underground pioneer , " another dismayed artist wrote			2
" this same stuff has happened to mine as well			0
it 's a bummer , but it is good to keep in mind that anything we put out there into the public is ephemeral , meaning it could last a long time or no time , " that artist said			2
" stick a nanny cam on there , get a mug shot , and then paint the dude 's face on there , wearing a t - shirt that says ' i 'm with stupid ' and an arrow pointing the guy 's head , " suggested another post			0
attack on establishment art " i 'm guessing they see a legitimate commissioned or permitted works of art , as being part of the establishment , " said @entity113			0
he was referring to the alley 's envious status of enshrining some of @entity6 's best art , organized by the volunteer artists ' collective @entity243 ( @entity243 )			1
" sadly , @entity243 has helped to contribute to the extreme gentrification of the @entity95 over these past two decades , " wrote artist @entity245 , a camp " core organizer " who defends the alley 's roots			1
" what started as a neighborhood - based project committed to diversity and inclusion , is now a magnet for lots of folks hoping to profit off of the image that @entity243 has created -- from the developers and real estate agents who use camp as a selling point for the ' cool , hip mission experience , ' to those who use the space for fashion shoots , to corporations hoping to include the ' gritty urban street art ' image to sell their products , to any number of paid tours by folks unrelated to @entity243 , spreading misinformation about the project , artists and murals , " she wrote on her website			1
no control over taggers many of @entity6 's large murals are the result of serious negotiations between artists and wall owners -- including shopkeepers , residents or city officials -- to ensure the painting remains visible and not erased for violating private property			1
but no one can control malicious taggers			0
" i believe taggers will always state their voice , " said @entity65			0
" whether it 's tagging a white wall , a mural , local mom and pop , venues , billboards , public transit or corporate buildings			1
" people attack murals because " they knew the artist , and maybe that artist they knew ' sold out			1
' " or they at one point were in the same crew , and now they are in different crews			0
" or jealousy and envy			0
or they just do n't care			0
" or they can be sending gang messages			0
" i do n't know what the punishment should be , if someone intentionally spray - painted over a mural			0
" it 's not like the law is involved , unless you 're tagging a @entity328 's ad , " @entity65 said , laughing			0
" i had someone tag one of my work - in - progress murals			1
" the silly part about this was how they displayed it			0
" my wall was about 15 feet high , 20 feet wide			0
their mark was no bigger then six inches			0
" you can see some of @entity6 's best murals and other art at websites for the @entity243 ; @entity343 ; @entity113 ; @entity344			1
@entity345 is a freelance writer from @entity6			1
he 's reported for international media from @entity347 since 1978 , based in @entity348 , @entity349 and now @entity350 .			0
