, several major airlines are offering sign - up bonuses this fall for their mileage dining programs			1
your favorite restaurant might offer from 1 to 10 miles for every dollar you spend			0
but are those miles enough to justify the logistical hassle of signing up and dining at designated restaurants ? the value of these programs depends on 1 ) taking advantage of some of the current sign - up bonuses ; 2 ) having at least one participating restaurant near where you live and that you might dine at every other month ; and 3 ) using the mile activity as a way to keep your frequent flier accounts active			1
@entity22 : @entity23 waters down its rapid rewards program one of the biggest things to change in the past year for these programs has been the development of smartphone apps			1
now , instead of having to bring along a clunky , quickly outdated paper directory of participating restaurants , you can get a real - time list of what spots will earn you miles			2
another change in recent years has been consolidation in the industry , with only one company @entity35 , running all of the major programs			2
this change has allowed programs to become simplified and standardized			0
if a restaurant participates in the program for @entity46 , it probably also does for @entity47 , too , and you can use the same downloadable app for your smart phone to figure it out			1
if you have more than one dining card , you can double up on your rewards			0
here 's the lowdown on how these programs work : it 's free to sign up for a dining card that gives airline credit every time you use it			1
@entity35 , for instance , will ( typically ) give you three @entity46 miles for every mile you spend at a restaurant			2
at a value of about a penny a mile , that credit amounts to a 5 percent rebate on a family of four 's typical restaurant check			0
compared with some charge - cards , that 's a decent mileage payoff			1
no wonder more than 3 million travelers are enrolled in these programs			0
all the dining programs work in a similar way			1
you sign up online for free at the sites ( see the list , below ) , punching in your frequent flier number and registering a debit or credit card ( @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84			1
) use the card to pay your bill ( including food , beverage , tax and tip ) at a participating restaurant , and then miles will be automatically credited to your frequent flier account			1
no need to tell the waiter			0
as i mentioned , sign - up bonuses can juice up your earnings			1
to use @entity46 as an example again because it 's so large , its dining program currently offers 1,000 mile bonus for signing up and spending at least $ 50 at a participating restaurant by the end of the year			1
@entity22 : ads on boarding passes -- are airlines sharing your info ? these are the sweetest bonuses being offered now : @entity109 bonus : earn an additional 500 miles if you spend $ 25 at a participating restaurant within a month of signing up			2
@entity47 bonus : earn 1,000 miles if you spend $ 25 at a participating restaurants within a month of signing up			2
@entity116 rewards dining bonus : spend $ 25 at participating restaurants within two months of signing up and you 'll receive 300 points @entity46 bonus : earn 1,000 miles extra for signing up and spending at least $ 50 at a participating restaurant by the end of the year			1
@entity125 bonus : earn 1,000 points if you spend $ 25 or more on two different occasions between now and the end of the year at participating restaurants			2
another perk of dining cards : it 's a no - sweat way to keep your frequent flier mileage accounts active and prevent the qualifying miles you earn by actually flying from expiring after the typical 18 - month span			1
( @entity138 will usually be deleted if an account is stagnant for 18 months			0
) the first step in deciding if the programs are worth it to you is to see if local restaurants that you love participate			0
it 's understandable to be suspicious that restaurants must be bad to have to throw 5 miles per dollar at you to eat at them			0
but because of the recession many eateries are becoming more competitive			0
you can always ask a waiter , of course , to see if the restaurant participates			0
or you can download a free app to find participating restaurants			0
the largest dining club program , @entity35 is a good example to use , as the major airlines @entity46 / @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity47 , @entity23 , and @entity125 all belong			1
find a participating restaurant by downloading one of these free apps : @entity169 , @entity168 / @entity167 , @entity170 there are some annoying downsides to the programs , though : one is that you can often only earn credit once per month ( or a similar limit ) at any one restaurant			2
the other is that , if you 're not careful in the e-mail preferences you fill out , you could be blitzed with messages from participating restaurants			0
if you block the e-mails , however , you could get only one mile per $ 1 spent -- or worse , maybe even nothing			0
