you can tell that much from its many retail stores , and in its products where glass is used in displays , notebook trackpads , and both the front and back of the @entity12			2
that last place , though is what might be causing the company some headaches			0
that 's according to a report today from @entity19 , which says that slip - on cases -- the kind that cover the back and sometimes front of the @entity12 , have been the cause of serious cosmetic damage with the backside of the @entity12			1
dirt and other loose bits of debris from your pocket end up in that space			0
over time , that can lead to a shattered backside as small scratches grow to become large cracks that travel across the back of the device , much like a ding on a windshield			1
this has become a big enough problem , the report says , that @entity1 's engineers have been hard at work in " a quiet lockdown , " testing various third - party cases to see how widespread the problem is , and presumably to make sure it does not happen with future iterations of the device			1
the news comes at an especially interesting time given the recent expiration of @entity1 's free @entity12 case program ( which included @entity1 's no closed - back bumper ) , and the reported beginnings of mass production for a cdma version of the @entity12 said to be coming to @entity59 in early 2011			1
if @entity1 is planning to bring any physical design changes to that version of the @entity12 , a back that 's susceptible to cracking could very well be holding up that process			2
this would n't be the first time cracks have cropped up on @entity1 's hardware , or the @entity12 line for that matter			1
both the @entity68 , which was introduced in 2000 , and the @entity69 experienced reports from users that the outsides were developing " hairline surface cracks			0
" similar blemishes had appeared on white versions of the company 's @entity77 notebooks , which @entity1 reportedly began acknowledging and repairing early last year			0
