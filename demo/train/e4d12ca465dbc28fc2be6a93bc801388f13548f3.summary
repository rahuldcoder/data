-- she was trying to get help for her sister			2
help for a woman who was distraught and uneven , having driven to @entity5 to get away from her husband			0
who had gone , at her sister 's urging , to a hospital only to sign herself out earlier in the day			1
a woman who was " talking about @entity12 and that there 's demons in my house , " her sister said on a 911 call			1
" i 'm trying to control her , " the sister said , expressing worry about her sister 's three children			1
" ... i 'm trying to keep them safe			0
" at first , the plea appeared to pay off : police caught up to the woman -- later identified as @entity27 -- after she sped away from her sister 's @entity29 apartment			1
an officer questioned her as her three children sat in the @entity34 's backseat , smiling and seemingly calm			2
@entity27 explained that she feared for her safety , worried that her estranged husband would harm them			1
according to a @entity29 @entity25 report , the officer believed she might have a mental illness			0
despite these concerns , the officer talked to a detective also at the scene and let her go on her way , concluding she could n't be held under a @entity5 law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired by mental illness and who possibly pose a risk of harm			2
almost two hours later tuesday , @entity27 drove her black minivan -- with the three kids still inside -- into the surf of the @entity54			1
@entity55 was driving along @entity29 on tuesday with his wife when they noticed the minivan driving through shallow water			0
they heard the screams , he said , of two children , who were crying and waving for help out of one of the rear windows			0
@entity55 threw the car in park and raced over to help			2
one child was screaming , @entity55 recalled wednesday to @entity0 's @entity69			2
" ' please help us , our mom is trying to kill us			0
' " the other child he could see was wrestling a woman for the steering wheel			0
but the woman just kept saying , " ' we 're ok			0
we 're ok , ' " as another man joined @entity55 trying to get the driver to stop			0
with the minivan in the cold , heavy surf of the @entity54 , the second man , @entity80 , opened a door and pulled out the two panicked children			1
there was a good chance if he and @entity55 had n't been there , the children , ages 10 and 9 , would have drowned inside the van as it pitched in the water , officials said			2
another child , a 3 - year - old girl , was strapped in a car seat			1
a lifeguard dived in through a front window and unbuckled the child and handed her to another lifeguard as the vehicle bobbed in water about 3 feet deep			0
meanwhile , @entity27 walked away quietly with a strange , almost " possessed " look on her face , witnesses said			1
authorities quickly caught up to her			0
and on friday she was officially arrested on three counts of attempted first - degree murder , according to @entity110 sheriff @entity109			2
given what authorities have said since tuesday 's incident , the charges hardly come as a surprise			2
still , as more details come out -- like the sister 's 911 call and the charging affidavit -- they paint an ever more disturbing picture , especially for @entity27 's children			1
for evidence of their ordeal , one need only listen to what all three continuously uttered when officers caught up with them at @entity129			0
" @entity130 tried to kill us			0
" @entity130 said : ' i am keeping all of us safe ' the story begins in @entity134 , where @entity27 and her children had been until she made the decision to leave the state , to leave her husband behind			1
her children later detailed the fractured relationship between their parents , as well as the time her son got into trouble after speaking to authorities probing a domestic situation there			0
" she came down to me for protection , " @entity27 's sister explained in her 911 call , of the quartet coming to the eastern @entity5 coast			1
@entity27 's sister was especially concerned about protecting the three children			1
@entity27 's fragile mental state led her to call police to ask for a well - being check " because she 's ... having psychosis or something or postpartum			1
" the sister explained they 'd gone to the hospital monday , only to have a pregnant @entity27 check herself out the next day even though " she 's still not all there			1
" and she 'd taken away the minivan 's keys so her sister could n't drive away with her children			1
however she did it , @entity27 drove off as her sister talked with police			1
that was followed by the initial encounter with the officer and detective , then later the incident on @entity29			0
the children later told investigators that their mother told them " to close their eyes and go to sleep			0
" as they screamed as the minivan went into the water , she insisted she was taking them to a better place , saying repeatedly : " i am keeping all of us safe			0
" after their rescue , @entity27 herself talked to authorities			1
" she seemed confused and jumped from one religious topic to another , " states the charging affidavit			0
@entity27 explained at one point that she 'd been driving " too close to the water ( when ) the waves pulled her in			2
" then , near the end of their talk , she said she did not want her husband around her children			0
on thursday night , an arrest warrant was signed for @entity27			1
and shortly after 11 a.m. -- after being released from @entity129 -- she was arrested			0
@entity27 was being held on three counts of aggravated child abuse in addition to the first - degree murder charge , @entity109 said friday			1
her bond has been set at $ 1.2 million , said @entity207 , the elected public defender for the 7th @entity208 of @entity5			1
@entity207 said he would seek a court hearing on that bond , which could occur in the next week or so			0
he said he was going to speak with @entity27 on saturday			2
investigators have claimed in the charging affidavit : " @entity27 acted with premeditated design to kill her three children			2
@entity0 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
