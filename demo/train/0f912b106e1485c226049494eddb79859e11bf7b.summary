@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 jury sunday convicted three members of a family of @entity8 immigrants of the " honor " murders of four female relatives whose bodies were found in an @entity1 canal			1
@entity14 , 58 ; his wife , @entity16 , 42 ; and their son , @entity17 , 21 , were found guilty of first - degree murder in the deaths of @entity14 's three teenage daughters and his first wife in his polygamous marriage			1
sunday 's verdicts followed a three - month trial , in which jurors heard wiretaps of @entity14 referring to his daughters as " whores " and ranting about their behavior			1
all three were sentenced to life in prison immediately after their convictions , with no chance of parole for 25 years			1
" this is a good day for @entity4 justice			0
our democratic society protects the rights of all , " @entity39 , the chief prosecutor in the case , told reporters outside the courthouse in @entity0			0
" it 's a very bad day , because this jury found that four strong , vivacious and freedom - loving women were murdered by their own family			1
" at least one @entity14 family supporter interrupted @entity39 with shouts of " lies " and called the verdict a " miscarriage of justice			1
" but others cheered the verdict as @entity39 continued			0
the three @entity14 sisters -- @entity60 , 19 , @entity61 , 17 , and @entity62 , 13 -- were found dead inside a car that plunged into the @entity64 in @entity0 on june 30 , 2009			1
@entity14 's first wife , 50 - year - old @entity65 , also died			1
the verdicts came on the second day of deliberations for a seven - woman , five - man jury in @entity0 , about 280 km ( 175 miles ) west of the family 's home in @entity72			1
there was no immediate comment from defense attorneys			0
prosecutors said the girls ' father , mother and brother all plotted to kill the four women in an " honor " murder			0
investigators claimed that hours of wiretapped conversations reveal a premeditated plan to punish rebellious , westernized daughters and their permissive advocate , @entity88			1
@entity14 and @entity89 admitted on the stand that they were upset with @entity60 for running off to marry a @entity92 man they hated , that @entity61 wore revealing clothes and had secret boyfriends , and @entity62 was failing in school and calling social workers to get her out of a home in turmoil			2
prosecutors argued that under instructions from his father , @entity16 used the family @entity103 to ram the other family car carrying the women into the canal			1
the shattered headlight on the @entity103 , they claim , matches the damage on the rear bumper of the family @entity111 in which the women were found dead			1
investigators also believed the victims might have died before they hit the water , because they were unable to escape despite their seat belts being unbuckled and the car being submerged in just 7 feet of water			2
in the three - month - long trial , @entity14 testified , " my children did a lot of cruelty toward me , " as he wept openly on the stand			2
he went on to say he believed his children " betrayed " him by dating and he did not hide his anger , saying a father would never expect that kind of behavior from this daughters			0
in taking the stand , @entity14 swore to tell the truth on the quran and he again invoked the holy book to say @entity136 does not condone killing people to preserve a family 's honor			1
in a direct response to a question from prosecutor @entity142 , @entity14 said , " to kill someone , you ca n't regain your respect and honor			1
respected lady , you should know that			0
in our religion , a person who kills his wife or daughter , there is nothing more dishonorable			0
how is it possible that someone would do that to their children , respected lady ? " " you might do it , " @entity142 calmly replied , " if you thought they were whores			0
" @entity14 had used that term in a conversation captured by wiretaps			2
investigators played hours of the wiretap recordings in court , alleging many conversations involving the three suspects prove they were plotting murder			2
in some of the most shocking conversations , @entity14 launched into a rant about his daughters ' behavior			1
" i say to myself , ' you did well			0
would they come back to life a hundred times , you should so the same again , ' " he says			0
and in another played in court and translated from the @entity8 language @entity184 , he says , " may the devil defecate on their graves ! this is what a daughter should be ? would a daughter be such a whore ? " @entity14 and his lawyers tried to explain that his shocking words are traditional expressions in @entity184 that should not be translated literally			2
but the jury also heard from an expert witness on honor murders -- a term @entity2 is using in the interest of clarity rather than the more common " honor killings " because the latter phrase does not properly describe the alleged crime			1
that witness , @entity205 professor @entity204 , said that in some families , honor is worth more than life			2
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity204 said that many times , honor crimes are calculated acts that involve more than one family member			2
" there is a very important difference between honor killing and violence against women in the form of domestic violence			0
it is plotted , it is premeditated			0
" what we need to understand is that the male power and the male desire for the control of the woman 's body and the woman 's sexuality -- the honor resides in that sort of understanding and the ownership of women 's body and sexuality , " he said			0
" so when that is being presented in a way that is not acceptable to the social norm , then the only way the honor can be restored is by purifying that			0
and the purification is through blood			0
