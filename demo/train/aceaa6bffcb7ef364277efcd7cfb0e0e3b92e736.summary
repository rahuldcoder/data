-- imagine taking a peaceful flight , gliding along without much noise or any fuel , effortlessly descending into the airport without a trace of emissions			2
sounds like a dream ? it is			0
but one we can imagine in the not - so - distant future			2
@entity12 , the brainchild of parent @entity14 , is a prototype hybrid electric motor glider which will first be used for training pilots for their license at a school in @entity20 , @entity21 , by 2017			1
it debuted with its first public test flight in april 2014 , and the two - seater electric aircraft is powered by two batteries , producing 60 kilowatts of power , which will be able to run for half an hour			1
the @entity12 has been a continuous journey of evolution , says chief technical officer @entity30			0
" this is a learning curve to get to the big ones in the future			0
" it started five years ago when @entity14 experimented with the @entity35 , a tiny plane based on the 1970s @entity35 , one of the smallest twin - engine planes in history			1
besides the benefits of noise and emissions reduction , the reduced cost of training pilots with the @entity12 is incredible , says @entity30			2
it costs about two cents per hour to fly the electric plane , a number which is up to 20 - 50 times cheaper than the normal fuel costs of today 's aircraft , he says			1
ultimately , these savings will get passed on to the customer , explained @entity30 , as the electric - powered flight training becomes a reality			1
what 's ahead for electric ? eventually , the company has its eye on building planes for regional flights , with up to 90 people flying for three hours , although this is still 15 - 20 years away , says @entity30			1
" we 're not talking about replacing the @entity62 , " he says			0
but the shorter - term goals also include helicopters with hybrid electric technology			1
for @entity14 , much of the investment is being mobilized by the @entity68 's " @entity67 " which aims to cut aircraft co2 emissions by 75 % , and noise levels to be reduced by 65 % from their 2000 levels			1
the goal is to make tens to hundreds of these planes , and @entity14 says it will be designed by schools with apprenticeship programs in order to help raise up the new engineers of tomorrow			1
the biggest challenge for @entity12 is developing new energy storage			0
" we can not afford to stay with the state of batteries today			0
we need to go much higher in terms of efficiency , " says @entity30 , adding that the company 's new research center in @entity86 , @entity87 , will have the capacity to do just that			0
alternative planes take off it 's not just @entity14 looking to alternative aircraft to help save energy , cut fuel consumption and reduce noise			1
there are several others developing alternative aircraft with their own success			0
recently , the @entity100 2 , a fully solar - powered aircraft , was unveiled by a @entity103 duo which will attempt to fly non-stop for 120 hours without any fuel next year			0
made of carbon fiber , its predecessor , @entity100 , smashed aviation records as it succeeded in the first solar - powered overnight flight , lasting 26 hours in 2010			2
another creation is the @entity112 - designed , @entity87 - built @entity111 , an electric aircraft with 23 - meter wings which can glide for 60 kilometers ( 37 miles )			2
the @entity111 can climb to 3,500 meters on a single battery charge .			0

electric hybrid motors signal a *greener* , quieter flight path

company plans to have electric flights for 90 *passengers* in 15 - 20 years
