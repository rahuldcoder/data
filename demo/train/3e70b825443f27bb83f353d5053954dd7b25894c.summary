-- @entity1 writes her son @entity2 all the time			2
" i send him e-mails , " she says , " keeping him updated on what 's going on			1
" each e-mail goes unanswered			2
all she can do is hope that he sees them			2
it 's how she copes with one of the most unsettling and baffling missing persons cases in recent years : the mystery of the @entity18 family			1
next week marks the third anniversary of the disappearance of @entity18 , 43 ; his wife , summer , 46 ; and their two young children , @entity26 , 7 , and @entity27 , who would be 6 this month			1
february 4 , 2010 was the last day anyone saw the family or heard from them			1
when police entered their @entity34 house more than 10 days later , they found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room			2
their two dogs were also in the home			2
but not a single trace of the @entity44			2
2010 : @entity34 police search for missing family did they voluntarily leave ? are they in @entity49 ? are they in danger ? are they dead ? despite hundreds of tips and several high - profile television reports and interviews , no one has a clue			1
" this is definitely an unusual case , " says lt. @entity58 of the @entity61 sheriff 's department 's homicide division " at this point we are no closer to finding them than on the day they disappeared			1
i know that sounds horrible , but we just do n't know what happened to them			2
" the sentiment is shared by @entity70 , who led the sheriff 's department investigation into the @entity44 ' disappearance before retiring last year			1
" nothing makes any kind of rational sense that you can put together , " @entity70 says			2
the @entity44 lived on a cul - de - sac in @entity79			2
described on its website as the " friendly village , " @entity79 is about 18 miles from the @entity82 and some 50 miles north of @entity61			2
@entity18 owned @entity83 , a company that built custom water features for high - end commercial businesses around the world , says @entity87 , his younger brother			0
@entity88 stayed home to raise the children , but according to @entity87 was planning on getting back to work			0
the family 's locked and abandoned @entity93 was located february 8 , 2010 , in @entity94 , just two blocks from the border			1
surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the @entity44 walking into @entity49			1
" if you look at the clothing that they were wearing at the time , it coincides with when the vehicle was found ; it leads you to believe that that was them crossing the border , " @entity70 says			1
" i ca n't say definitively it 's them , but it 's a high probability			1
" we do believe the family on the tape going into @entity49 is that of the @entity44 , " he says			1
but @entity2 's mother is n't convinced			1
" my son 's meds were in that car , " she tells @entity0			1
" my son has asthma and does n't go anywhere without the meds on him			0
and to have babies go without car seats			0
this is the stuff that does n't add up			0
" @entity87 says he is not sure if the family is on the video			1
" the best is that the children appear to be size appropriate , but i could never get an id off the adult			1
even if it were them crossing , we still do n't know to what intent			1
we do n't know if it was under duress or willingly			0
" however , he says he believes someone has an answer			0
" how does somebody not see them ? " he wonders			0
" they have to go get groceries , get the basic necessities of life ; they have to have a way to generate an income			0
there has to be something			0
" my brother is out there			0
i want what everyone wants , a phone call , a letter , something			0
i do n't want to know why he left			0
we just have to know that they are ok			0
" @entity87 is familiar with the theories speculating on what might have happened , including one presented in the new book , " no goodbyes : the mysterious disappearance of the @entity18			1
" author @entity169 says his own investigation , including reviewing hundreds of personal e-mails , shows that @entity88 and @entity2 were having problems and that their relationship was , in his words , about to " explode			1
" @entity169 speculates , among other things , that at least one of the family members may have met with foul play			1
@entity87 bristles when asked to comment on @entity169 's suggestion			1
" i do n't know how he sleeps at night , " @entity18 says of the author			1
" i suspect he 's looking for money			1
he 's a good manipulator and knows how to twist things			1
he 's just trying to sell books			1
" @entity185 , the mother , says there were many inaccuracies in the book			0
" it was very hard to read all this , very heartbreaking , the accusations			0
" she says , " the bottom line for me is this book will bring focus to finding the family , sad to say			1
" @entity58 cautions there is no evidence of any criminal activity			0
" everything leads us to believe the disappearance is voluntary			1
it 's still categorized as a missing persons case , " he says			1
" we have to rely on facts and evidence			0
we do n't want to publicize unsubstantiated theories			0
everyone has theories , however we ca n't come out and say this is what actually happened unless we have something to back that up			0
other people can , but that 's not the business we are in			1
" @entity70 says he thinks anything is possible			0
" if you are staying together as a group , as a family of four , it 's probably a little more difficult			1
if you want the kids to go to school , questions are asked , and with the @entity225 everybody is an amateur detective			0
" @entity87 and his mother get reported sightings of the @entity44 on a regular basis			0
they come from all over the country			0
@entity87 , who says he chases them all down , recently received a tip from @entity233 , where his brother owned property			0
" every time one comes your heart pumps and you hope to @entity238 that this is it , " @entity185 says , " and when it 's not you fall apart			2
it 's heartbreaking and very hard			2
" she is n't giving up			0
neither is @entity87 , though both are mindful that ultimately the truth could be devastating			0
" until my dying day i will try to resolve this thing			0
i have to know where my brother and my family are , " @entity87 says			2
" i 'm going to have to stick with this for the rest of my life			0
so that we can have some peace			0
i know all of us need peace			0
" @entity185 says the search for her family is the biggest fight of her life			2
" i refuse to give up			0
i hope to @entity238 , but at the same time it 's been three years			1
" how can a family of four just disappear ? "			2
