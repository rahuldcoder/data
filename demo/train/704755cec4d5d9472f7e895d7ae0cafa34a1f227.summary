@entity0 , @entity1 -- to escape @entity4 , @entity3 traveled for more then 10 hours on foot and on horseback over the mountains , crossing the border illegally into @entity8			1
soon afterwards , he ended up in a detention center for illegal immigrants in @entity11 , where he was incarcerated for nearly a week			0
after several surreal and sometimes dangerous weeks , @entity3 's journey appears to finally be over			1
he now strolls the tidy , rain - soaked streets of @entity1 's capital , safe from the @entity4 security forces who he claims targeted him			1
but @entity3 is far from at ease			2
" i do n't like to be a refugee , nor do i like to work abroad , " he says			0
" my love is to remain in @entity4 and help people who somehow have been oppressed whether by society or by the law or by the judicial system			2
but regrettably , i became a victim			0
" @entity3 is a human rights lawyer			2
he specializes in defending @entity4 under the age of 18 , who have been sentenced to death for crimes ranging from murder to sodomy			1
@entity4 ranks second in the world after @entity34 for annual executions of prisoners			2
but according to @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity4 leads the world for the number of death sentences carried out against juvenile defendants			1
@entity38 reports that since 2005 , the @entity4 judiciary has executed dozens of @entity4 who were convicted of crimes committed below the age of 18			2
" i have worked and handled 40 cases so far and out of these , thank @entity47 , 18 were saved , " @entity3 says			2
" regrettably four were hanged			0
" in 2008 and 2009 , four of @entity3 's juvenile clients were executed			1
they include @entity52 , who was hung on may 1st 2009 for a murder allegedly committed when she was 17 years old and @entity54 , executed on october 11th , 2009 for stabbing another teenager to death when he was 17 years old			0
human rights groups point out that @entity4 is a signatory to the @entity60 's @entity59 and the @entity61 , both of which prohibit executions for crimes committed under the age of 18			1
" these are arbitrary executions , " argues @entity3			2
for his criticism of this policy , the lawyer says authorities prevented him from traveling outside of @entity4 for a seven - month period			2
" i was contacted several times and warned to watch out			0
sometimes i saw that i was being followed , " he adds			0
" my home phones and my offices phones were monitored			0
" the defense attorney appeared to have finally crossed a red line due to his outspoken defense of @entity79 , the 43 - year - old mother of two who was sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery			1
international uproar over the case has been a source of embarrassment for the @entity87			0
activists around the world have staged protests demanding @entity4 authorities commute the sentence			2
more recently , the president of @entity94 , whose government recently broke with @entity97 countries and voted in the @entity60 @entity98 against imposing a fresh round of sanctions against @entity4 over its nuclear program , made a public offer of asylum to help @entity79 escape the death sentence			1
on july 24th , @entity3 says he was brought into @entity105 's @entity107 for hours of interrogation			1
he was later released , only to discover that , in his absence , security forces had raided his office and detained his wife and brother - in - law			0
" the hostage - taking led me to leave the country , " @entity3 says			1
when @entity3 was later detained after smuggling himself into @entity8 , the @entity1 government intervened at the highest level to have him released			1
" there is a courageous man who raises cases -- difficult cases -- which the authorities do n't like and he sees himself in a position where he has to flee across a mountain			0
he sees his wife imprisoned			0
well , i think we should wake up and speak out , " said @entity127 , the foreign minister of @entity1 , in an interview with @entity2			0
@entity1 's top diplomat says , on principle , his government opposes the death penalty			1
" the death penalty against juvenile people is an especially bad thing , " says @entity127			1
" @entity4 being among the countries with the most such cases			0
" barely a week after arriving in @entity0 under @entity1 government protection , @entity3 appears to be very much on an emotional roller coaster , swinging rapidly from elation to despair			1
he relishes the chance to focus attention on @entity4 's human rights record , which he argues is often over-shadowed by international concern over @entity4 's nuclear program			1
" what matters more inside @entity4 are human rights issues , " @entity3 says			1
" lack of freedom of speech , lack of freedom of thought , the newspapers are not free , the students are not free , the [ political ] parties are not free ... human rights issues in the prosecutors ' offices are far more important than issues of world nuclear energy			0
" but @entity3 's new international platform for publicity has come at considerable personal cost			1
on august 7th , @entity3 's wife @entity165 was released on bail after spending 13 days in solitary confinement			1
" when they found that my husband was out of @entity4 and they could n't reach him and i would n't be a good hostage any more , that 's when they released me , " @entity165 said in a phone interview with @entity2 last week			1
@entity165 's father and brother were also briefly detained , but later released after posting bail for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars			0
all three now await trial in @entity105			0
" i can imagine that with him being here and the family being there he [ @entity183 ] feels concerned , " says @entity1 foreign minister @entity127			0
" and knowing the track record of the @entity4 regime when it comes to people like that i do n't question his concern			0
" " i hope @entity4 will get better in the future , " @entity3 said , during a rainy walk along a waterfront boardwalk in @entity0			1
" but i do n't know when			0
maybe five years , ten years , i do n't know			0
" then , his mood momentarily brightened as he pointed across @entity0 's harbor , exclaiming " very beautiful			2
" a rainbow had appeared over the water ... a much - needed sign of hope , perhaps , for a man who has lost his job , his country , and now faces prolonged separation from his wife and daughter .			0
