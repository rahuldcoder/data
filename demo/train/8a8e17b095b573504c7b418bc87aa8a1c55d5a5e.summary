-- it 's best not to monkey around with @entity2 -- or maybe that 's a bad choice of words			2
the billionaire real estate mogul is suing millionaire comedian @entity6 for $ 5 million			1
why ? because @entity6 said -- in jest , as comedians are wont to do -- that he would donate $ 5 million to a charity if @entity2 could prove he was n't the " the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan			1
" " i 'm not saying it 's true , " @entity6 told @entity15 on " @entity16 " last month			2
" i hope it 's not true , but unless he comes up with proof ... i 'm willing to offer $ 5 million to @entity2 that he can donate to a charity of his choice -- @entity22 ; the @entity23 - bag - ery			1
" opinion : hijacking the media -- @entity2 shows how easy it is @entity6 picked the figure after @entity2 , long a skeptic of president @entity31 's citizenship , offered to give $ 5 million to the charity of @entity31 's choice if the president publicly released his college transcripts in addition to his passport records ahead of last year 's elections			1
the @entity39 never directly responded to the challenge			0
@entity2 says he provided @entity6 with a @entity42 birth certificate that proved he did n't descend from an ape -- but @entity6 has n't paid up			1
@entity2 filed the lawsuit in @entity45 on monday			0
included in the court documents are a january 8 letter to @entity6 , accepting the $ 5 million charity challenge the day after his appearance on @entity15 , and a copy of @entity2 's birth certificate , which lists @entity52 as his father -- not an orangutan			1
it 's a free - swinging smackdown by two men used to speaking their minds and not backing down			0
@entity6 , never afraid to ape the object of his pithy humor , was unrelenting on " @entity16 " in pushing the simian connection			0
" the color of his hair ( pauses for laughs ) and the color of an orange orangutan is the only two things in nature of the same color , " @entity6 said to another round of nervous chuckles from the audience			0
the comedian 's reaction to the lawsuit ? " what ? ? really ? @entity77 , " he tweeted			0
perhaps , he is waiting for @entity2 to release his long - form birth certificate .			2
