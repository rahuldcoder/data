a newly discovered asteroid will pass " very close " to @entity2 on sunday , @entity0 says			1
the space rock is estimated to be 60 feet ( 18 meters ) long			0
it 's expected to fly over @entity5 about 2:18 p.m. edt ( 11:18 a.m. pdt / 18:18 utc			1
) it wo n't hit @entity2 or any of the thousands of satellites orbiting the planet , @entity0 says			1
it will give astronomers and scientists a chance to study it			2
the asteroid wo n't be visible the naked eye , but amateur astronomers should be able to see it with telescopes			1
called 2014 @entity16 , the asteroid was discovered on august 31 by the @entity17 near @entity18 , @entity19			0
@entity0 's @entity20 estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten @entity2 , but experts say none of the ones being tracked are expected to hit the planet anytime soon			1

the @entity34 meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky			0
it exploded on the same day that asteroid 2012 @entity44 , one that was being carefully tracked by @entity0 , safely passed by @entity2			2
@entity0 is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten @entity2			2
its @entity48 includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s			0
if it works , astronauts will land on the asteroid , take samples and bring them back to @entity2 .			0

@entity16 will fly " very close " to @entity2 on sunday
@entity2 's not in *danger* , @entity0 says , but the flyby will give scientists something to study
the asteroid , which is expected to fly over @entity5 , wo n't be visible the naked eye
