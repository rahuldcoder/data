-- i never imagined we would find a no - win question to displace the genre 's champ , " have you stopped beating your wife ? " now , there is contender : " does austerity work ? " @entity11 tells us it does n't , faulting it for @entity15 's constriction			1
the problem is not a borderless @entity15 financial system , unable to quarantine nations sick with public and private debt			1
oh , no , @entity11 writes , " the larger failure , shared across @entity15 , has been too much austerity			1
" in the @entity23 , @entity22 notes unemployment is " skyrocketing " across @entity15 and he contends the fault lies in shrinking budget deficits brought by spending cuts and tax increases			1
@entity22 tells us this is what austerity looks like " and it can be expected to reduce economic growth			1
" as the @entity34 slides into a double - dip recession , economist @entity33 blames @entity37 's austerity			1
borrowing from @entity38 , he tells us , " the boom , not the slump , is the right time for austerity			1
" never mind that spending in @entity34 is virtually unchanged and other nations in @entity15 are spending more			1
@entity45 writes that " austerity , " as practiced in @entity48 countries , has actually increased government spending from 46 % to 51 % of @entity15 's gdp from 2006 to 2010			1
@entity51 , where rioters protest " austeros , " increased its public sector expenditures from 45.2 % of gdp to 50.1 % tin he same period			0
as the @entity57 noted , in 2011 , 23 of the @entity59 's 27 nations jacked up their spending levels			1
apparently , it is not austerity itself that constricts economies			1
the mere thought of austerity is enough to choke the eurozone to death			1
austerity seems to be working just fine for the masters of the practice , the @entity72 : we are counting on them to bail out the entire eurozone			2
let 's ignore that , however			2
instead , let 's assume @entity15 had not only contemplated austerity but also actually imposed it : cutting spending , raising taxes and shrinking its public sector			1
even then , " does austerity work ? " would be the wrong question			2
let 's view the occasional need to embrace responsibility through a more familiar , though equally unpopular lens : does " sobriety " work ? immediately , it would n't seem so			1
when we engage in " sobriety , " after a long period of over-indulgence , its effect is much like " austerity ; " our heads hurt , our tongues get fuzzy and our vision blurs			1
i would invite my friends in journalism , dedicated to the rigorous pursuit of truth , to join me in extended study			0
we might conclude , through the crusty eyes of another morning , that drinking alcohol does not cause hangovers ; stopping drinking alcohol causes hangovers			0
sobriety does not work , it seems -- and governments feel no better when they sober up from a binge			1
when an economy stops borrowing money from its future , well , there is less money in that economy in the present			0
yet we do not blame the glutton who ordered the meal for this poverty , just the fool who pays the check			2
would n't we all feel better if we lifted our glasses and had another round ? we are persuaded to drink our way through our drunkenness , even if we have to borrow the money			2
why should n't gratification be instant and eternal ? life , we are eager to believe , should be frictionless			2
we are happy to hear that we are not required to suffer penalties for stupid economic decisions			0
our leaders , godlike and high above , tell us their brilliance can protect us from the consequences of our poor choices			0
spend what we do n't have , they urge : the same euro , dollar or pound that is invaluable when we put it in to stimulate an economy will not be missed when we pull it out			2
the same journalists who laugh at the idea of perpetual motion embrace the voodoo of perpetual prosperity			0
they twist modest @entity154 into an arrogant declaration that we are above the cost of our excesses			0
no longer must @entity158 ask @entity159 to walk the desert to reach the @entity161			0
on june 17 , the world will come to an end , as it often does			0
ripples from @entity15 's unraveling will begin traveling to @entity166			1
@entity51 will have an election			0
@entity51 will vote to make @entity72 work until they are 67 so they can retire at 50			0
they will vote to make someone else pay their bills , fund their holidays and support their benefits			0
they will be lectured about this by an @entity166 president who asks his own nation to make @entity176 pay its bills , fund its holidays and support its benefits			0
we can only hope he does it from the @entity51 state of @entity184 , which has also attempted to outsmart austerity			2
remarkably , it has n't grown jobs , just debt			2
@entity33 is a noble man			0
if he could , with his bright mind , he would free us from the costs of our foolish economic decisions , many of which he has recommended			0
he is the blackjack player , deep in debt , who knows he can outsmart the house			0
on our behalf , with his infallible system , he 'll keep doubling his bet every hand until he wins back our money -- unless he hits the house limit or a run of bad luck empties his pockets first			0
that is not an uncommon fate for the adversaries of austerity			2
genuinely bright people built @entity211 on the arrogance of such men			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216			1

commentators are placing the blame for @entity15 's spending woes on government austerity
@entity216 says @entity15 has n't really embraced austerity yet
he says the binge in government spending ca n't go on *forever*
@entity216 : asking whether austerity works is like asking a drinker if sobriety works
