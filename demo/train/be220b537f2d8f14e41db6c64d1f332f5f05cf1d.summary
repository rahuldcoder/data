@entity0 -- an intense struggle among several senior @entity4 officials was revealed friday as internal documents on the gun - running @entity6 were released by the department			2
about 1,400 pages that had been demanded by @entity10 investigators were sent to three key congressional committees in advance of what is expected to be a contentious hearing next thursday when attorney general @entity15 testifies on the subject			1
the documents lift the veil on conflicting views among @entity4 executives , the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , and the @entity25 @entity24 attorney 's office over whether and how to respond to allegations made in letters from sen. @entity28 , @entity29			1
@entity28 had demanded to know whether , as whistle - blowers claimed , the @entity21 was allowing firearms bought by suspected straw purchasers in @entity25 to " walk " across the border into @entity35 , and into the arms of drug cartels			1
@entity28 had alleged the @entity21 's surveillance operation lost track of weapons and two of them ended up at the scene where @entity44 agent @entity44 was murdered last december			1
in early february 2011 , as the issue was heating up , the documents show justice officials struggled for days over how to respond to @entity28			1
repeated drafts were required as the issue rose for discussion among the deputy attorney general 's staff			2
at the last moment , justice officials halted sending out letters to @entity28 because of uncertainty over the facts of @entity6 , and over how forcefully to respond			1
assistant attorney general @entity58 was especially concerned about protecting the @entity4 position that details about ongoing investigations not be revealed			2
other officials , notably in the deputy attorney general 's office , said it was crucial in this unusual and important situation to be candid and forthright to a key @entity24 senator			1
@entity66 , the @entity24 attorney for @entity25 , defended the operation , and appears to have become exasperated at the @entity4 's cautious response			0
" every version gets weaker			0
we will be apologizing to ( @entity28 ) by tomorrow afternoon , " he wrote			0
@entity66 and @entity21 headquarters officials insisted the charge that agents " allowed the sale of weapons which were transported into @entity35 is false			2
" he also insisted the " @entity21 makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally			0
" when those claims , included in a february 4 letter to @entity28 , later proved to be wrong , assistant attorney general @entity79 and later @entity15 were forced to apologize to a @entity83 committee and to @entity28 in particular			1
@entity66 resigned at the end of august , just days after testifying before a congressional committee			0
on friday , deputy attorney general @entity86 said the @entity4 " now formally withdraws the february 4 letter			2
" he said facts have come to light that indicate that the letter contains " inaccuracies			0
" @entity15 is expected to again express his " regret " for the misinformation before the @entity93 - controlled @entity92			0
@entity79 and @entity15 steadfastly maintain they did not know the assertions were wrong when the department sent @entity28 the letter			0
@entity4 officials claim they were relying on information provided by @entity21 supervisors and their prosecutors in @entity104			0
the document dump " appears to raise ( even ) more questions " for various officials involved in the program , said @entity105 , a spokeswoman for @entity28			1
she made specific reference to " disparaging e-mails " from @entity66 about the @entity113 senator			0
the former @entity24 attorney " personally apologized to @entity28 's staff for the tone and the content of the e-mails " after learning they 'd been released , according to @entity119 .			1
