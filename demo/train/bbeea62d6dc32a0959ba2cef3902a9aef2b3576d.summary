-- if you want to salute , race or flirt with other drivers in @entity4 , you could soon be out of luck with some cars			0
that 's because on monday , @entity4 became the first to approve a license for " autonomous vehicles " -- in other words , cars that cruise , twist and turn without the need for a driver -- on its roads			1
the license goes to @entity17 , the @entity18 technology giant known more for its search engine and e-mail service that nonetheless has been known to dive into other big ideas such as space elevators to @entity25 - enabled glasses			2
in a 2010 post on @entity17 's official blog , engineer and @entity30 founder @entity26 said that the self - driving vehicle project aims " to help prevent traffic accidents , free up people 's time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally changing car use			1
" he noted that the " automated cars use video cameras , radio sensors and a laser range finder to ' see ' other traffic , as well as detailed maps ... to navigate the road ahead			0
" there is no driver needed , though one is typically in the front seat ready to take control if need be			0
earlier this spring , @entity17 said it had " safely completed over 200,000 miles of computer - led driving			1
" monday marked a new milestone for the project , when @entity4 issued a special license after demonstrations on state freeways , state highways , in @entity59 neighborhoods and on @entity60 ' landmark @entity60 , the state 's @entity50 said in a news release			0
the new plate is red and features the infinity symbol and the letters @entity65 , for autonomous vehicle			2
all such cars on the road are " test " vehicles for now , though the state signaled it intends to be " at the forefront of autonomous vehicle development			0
" " i felt using the infinity symbol was the best way to represent the ' car of the future , ' " state dmv director @entity75 said			0
" when there comes a time that vehicle manufactures market autonomous vehicles to the public , that infinity symbol will appear on a green license plate			1
" @entity17 was the first company to apply to test its self - driving system in @entity4 , the state said , while indicating that " other auto manufacturers have indicated their desire to test and develop " such technology in the state .			1

@entity4 approves a license for " autonomous vehicles " that drive themselves
@entity17 will test out its self - driving technology in the state ; other companies may follow
