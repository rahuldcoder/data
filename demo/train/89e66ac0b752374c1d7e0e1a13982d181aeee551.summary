-- for some of you , the focus on @entity2 shifted roughly 20 minutes after swallowing the last bite of @entity7 pie and you set out to find the best spot for your @entity10 tent			1
one of the great joys ( or , depending on who you are , nightmares ) of the holiday commerce season is the never - ending stream of @entity2 music filling in all the empty airspace in your local shopping malls and department stores			1
but what if you 're shopping online , and somehow avoiding every other vestige of public - space holiday - music inundation ? to help you , here 's a rundown of some of the new stuff added to the yearly snowpile of @entity33 releases			1
@entity34 , @entity35 the undisputed champ of this season 's holiday music bonanza is @entity34 , whose first holiday album is currently doing big business ( it narrowly missed preventing @entity41 from being the top album in the country this week )			1
his approach is very much " @entity49 , " but it 's still @entity34 - ily charming , and his original composition " @entity46 " will be an alternate - universe hit next @entity33 season			1
collect all 4 hobbit covers : when you subscribe to @entity0 ! @entity52 , @entity53 the music world was half - expecting a new album from @entity52 's old hip - hop group @entity56 this holiday season , but instead we got @entity61 favorite 's blast of red - velvet funk ( and that 's red velvet like @entity66 's suit , not the sexy cake kind )			1
its @entity69 bounce recalls all the great @entity71 tracks of yesteryear , and the inclusion of the @entity74 ( on " @entity75 " ) is never not awesome			2
@entity76 for over two decades , the @entity78 compilations have brought together some of rock and pop 's biggest names to pay tribute to the season and raise money for the @entity85			0
for the group 's 25th anniversary , they pulled together some classics , including a silky smooth @entity90 © take on " it 's @entity94 " and a live recording of @entity93 's alarmingly sweet original " @entity92			0
" @entity96 , @entity97 the sonic version of an eternally burning yule log			0
though you 've heard these songs before , the band uses their three - part harmonies to melt the deepest snow and the iciest @entity106 heart			0
( or more likely , just make your mom really happy			0
) @entity108 like the indie version of now that 's what i call @entity2 , @entity108 brings together @entity113 , @entity114 , and a bevy of other on - the - @entity117 acts doing @entity33 favorites			1
nobody has more fun than , uh , fun. , who blow through " @entity123 " with the same kind of joyful abandon they bring to their own hits			0
@entity127 , @entity128 , it 's @entity2 with this album and his recent one - hour primetime special , is @entity127 taking @entity66 's place as the new mascot of @entity2 ? it 's possible			2
@entity127 's standards are to be expected , but his original composition " @entity66 's got a @entity136 " has charisma to spare			0
@entity138 , christmas with @entity139 @entity138 's album made a huge jump up the @entity143 chart this week , which means that his core demographicâ € ” country fans who find @entity127 too edgyâ € ” have made their way to their local record emporium			0
listen to his " @entity149 " only if you do n't like booze in your eggnog			0
@entity154 , a very merry perri christmas because even goth kids need a little @entity2 cheer , @entity154 lends her icy alto to a handful of standards plus an original called " @entity161 " that provides some fantastically melodic holiday haunting			2
