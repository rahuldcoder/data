-- @entity2 climber @entity1 has become the third cyclist to be kicked out of this year 's @entity4 after testing positive for the blood - booster @entity5 , but by far the most high profile			1
@entity1 is the highest - profile of the three riders so far ejected from this year 's @entity4			1
@entity1 , who had already won two stages in the race and was lying in ninth position overall , was taken off the @entity14 team bus by police on thursday and booed by spectators , @entity9 reported			1
@entity14 subsequently pulled all of its riders , including eighth - placed @entity19 and stage 10 winner @entity20 , out of the race as they sought to investigate the situation			2
" it 's a team decision not to start the race , " sporting director @entity23 told @entity9 " he 's our leader , we ca n't act as if nothing happened			0
we suspend the activities of the team until we know what happened			0
" the 24 - year - old @entity1 , considered one of the world 's top climbers , tested positive for @entity5 after the fourth stage , a time trial in the western town of @entity35			1
he had come under suspicion about what he says is his naturally high hematocrit level -- the volume of red blood cells in his system			0
high hematocrit levels can suggest use of @entity5 , but do not confirm it			2
" may the cheaters get caught			0
may they go away , " said @entity4 president @entity44			2
" i said to the riders before the race , behind closed doors , that you have the key ( to stop doping in cycling ) ... some did n't get the message			0
" ahead of thursday 's 12th stage , @entity1 was two minutes and 29 seconds behind overall leader @entity54 of @entity55 -- but was expected to close the gap when the race reaches the @entity57 next week			1
he had won the sixth and ninth stages and was top of the @entity60 and @entity61 categories to confirm his status as one of the sport 's rising stars			0
@entity1 came into the @entity68 event in fine form , having finished second overall at his home @entity72 , winning two stages in the process			2
he follows @entity76 duo @entity75 and @entity77 in being kicked out of the race following positive drug tests			1
@entity75 , of the @entity81 team , was also busted for using @entity5 on wednesday , while veteran @entity82 rider @entity77 was ejected last friday after testing positive for the same substance			1
the controversies have provided even more embarrassment for race organizers , already reeling after @entity87 was stripped of his 2006 title for steroid use and @entity90 was kicked off while leading last year 's race for lying to his team to avoid a random drug test			1
