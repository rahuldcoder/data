@entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 weapons flowed into the nation			0

the opposition had @entity146 , @entity133 and @entity147 small arms , @entity88 said , escalating the weapons buildup of both sides			1

" the treaty has been in the works since 2006 , when the @entity204 requested all countries to submit their views on a binding arms trade treaty			1
that year , the @entity6 , under the @entity209 administration , voted against the resolution that started the process			0
