journeying by day through @entity0 is a tense , nervy experience			0
but for some , nightfall in this part of northeastern @entity4 has become truly frightening with the threat from @entity6 seemingly everywhere			1
this state has been a springboard for a wave of indiscriminate bombings , kidnappings and assassinations perpetrated by this exceptionally violent militant @entity14 group whose name translates to " @entity18 education is sin " in the local @entity21 language			0
yet it was n't until recently , when hundreds of schoolgirls were snatched at gunpoint from a boarding school as they slept in their beds , that this brutal insurgency really grabbed the world 's attention			1
the terrifying and audacious nature of this raid in the dead of night under a hail of gunfire and explosions sent shock waves far beyond @entity4 's borders			1
when a @entity40 crew made the perilous journey to @entity42 almost a month after the girls ' abduction , they discovered the attack had left an indelible mark on this community			1
locals described fearing the onset of nightfall when they felt most vulnerable , most abandoned by the outside world			2
police fled before their village was stormed , some residents claimed friends and relatives in surrounding towns had warned them the feared extremists were on their way in a convoy of cargo trucks , pickups and motorcycles			2
they said they reported this to local authorities that night			1
the police , they said , called for reinforcements but none came			0
everyone , including the police , fled into the bush , leaving the girls asleep in their dorms			0
the gunmen overpowered the school 's guards and herded the girls onto the waiting trucks			1
the trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering @entity80 , a stronghold for the terror group			0
authorities do not know where the girls are being held			2
" it was horrific , it happened in the night , it was very dark			0
but the sound of gunshots , explosions everywhere , " recalled @entity88 , who witnessed the attack firsthand with his family			0
" we had to run away from our homes			0
we had to run into the bushes for our lives			0
" the memory of that horrifying night on april 14 and the fear of further attacks like it has forced men like @entity88 to take matters into their own hands			1
armed only with machetes , homemade bow and arrows and any other improvised weapons they can find , the community 's men come together each evening to patrol their village			1
their nightly vigil consists of a cautious walk around their village , led by the thin light from their small torches			0
occasionally they 'll improvise a road block by dragging a tree on to the dirt track to block vehicles			0
it 's a pitiful defense against the heavily - armed militants , but they hope and pray they can protect their sleeping families against further violence and destruction			0
resilience but fear is gradually giving way to resilience here , as @entity42 's residents grow tired of waiting for outside help to arrive			2
@entity4 's government has been forced to defend its response to the crisis , with president @entity138 roundly criticized for waiting three weeks to speak to the nation about efforts to find and free the girls			1
and the military 's campaign to subdue @entity6 has had little success since a state of emergency was declared in @entity4 's north a year ago this month			1
during the day , @entity42 returns to something like normality with its vibrant market a focal point			2
but the physical scars from april 's attack are brought sharply into focus once again -- the burned - out shell of the girls ' school stands as a reminder of the scale of the destruction that fateful night .			1
