-- one of the most dominant theories of this year 's presidential election is that president @entity4 's re-election prospects have been undermined by high unemployment levels			1
yet despite a dismal labor market , which saw a net increase of only 103,000 private - sector jobs for august , the president has been widening his lead over @entity11 in recent days			1
this raises the possibility that other factors are trumping high unemployment			2
to be sure , the fact that the unemployment rate has remained above 8 % throughout @entity4 's first term has greatly contributed to the sense among many that his economic agenda has been a failure			1
perhaps the most memorable speech at the @entity25 , by former president @entity23 , was devoted to defending the current president 's job creation record , a clear sign that @entity29 recognize it as their central vulnerability			2
opinion : @entity23 brings it for @entity4 yet one of the ironies of the 2012 presidential campaign is that the incumbent president has benefited from strong support among many of the constituencies that have been hardest - hit by high unemployment levels , particularly black @entity41 and @entity42			1
this has left the @entity11 campaign in the position of having to win over voters who 've fared relatively well since 2008			1
unfortunately , we do n't have reliable or consistent data on the political preferences of the unemployed			0
the numbers we do have are fragmentary			0
for example , a recent survey of 18 - to - 29 - year - old voters sponsored by the @entity53 found that while only 14 % of @entity11 voters were unemployed , almost a third of @entity4 voters were unemployed			1
undecided voters fell somewhere in between , with 25 % of them unemployed			0
this hardly settles the question , but the fact that the president fares so well with demographic groups that have experienced higher unemployment rates is nevertheless suggestive			1
perhaps the most obvious explanation is that voters interpret economic data through the lens of their cultural and political affiliations			0
voters who are disinclined to favor a @entity25 incumbent will be more likely to interpret disappointing jobs numbers as an indictment of @entity4 while voters who are more favorably disposed towards @entity29 will maintain that he is doing the best that can be expected of him in the face of powerful economic and political headwinds			1
with that in mind , we can learn a great deal by taking a closer look at different groups in different states			2
for example , of the three states with unemployment rates above 10 % , two , @entity86 and @entity87 , are heavily urban , coastal states that overwhelmingly support @entity4			1
the third , @entity93 , is more closely contested , though most surveys find that the state is leaning toward backing the president			0
this is despite the fact that @entity93 is one of the states that has been most adversely impacted by the housing bust			0
the state is also 27 % @entity42			0
and though its electorate is considerably less so , the fact that @entity103 tend to favor @entity29 more strongly than do white @entity104 has given the president a significant boost			0
opinion : three hurdles for @entity4 , @entity11 the political configuration of states with unemployment levels from 8 % to 10 % is also quite interesting			1
@entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 are all in the @entity11 column			1
several of these states are part of the cultural region political analyst @entity124 has called " @entity125 , " a region that moved toward the @entity127 even as the rest of the country moved away from it between 2004 and 2008			0
others , including @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , have electorates that are defined by racial polarization			0
the large black minorities in these states tend to be strongly @entity25 while the white majorities tend to be strongly @entity127			0
moreover , unemployment rates in the black population in these @entity140 states tend to be much higher than unemployment rates in the white population			2
this implies that many of the president 's strongest supporters in these states have been touched by unemployment , either directly or indirectly , while many of his staunchest critics have emerged unscathed			2
many of the unemployed and underemployed households in these states have benefited from the extension of unemployment benefits , the expansion of eligibility for the @entity158 and other social transfer programs that the president and congressional @entity29 fought for as part of the 2009 fiscal stimulus law and in subsequent budget battles with congressional @entity127			2
the @entity4 - supporting states with unemployment levels between 8 % and 10 % -- such as @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 in the northeastern @entity41 , @entity169 in the @entity170 and @entity171 and @entity172 in the @entity173 -- are states in which college - educated voters , who 've fared relatively well in the post-crisis economy , have shifted to the @entity29 at least since the @entity23 presidency			1
these are in a sense the @entity4 voters who do n't present much of a puzzle -- relatively insulated from the weak economy , they 're more likely to vote on the basis of their socially liberal values			2
less affluent voters in these states , meanwhile , disproportionately benefit from the aid programs championed by the president and his allies			0
opinion : harsh realities for @entity29 earlier this summer , @entity193 , a political scientist based at the @entity195 , shed light on this underlying dynamic by considering how @entity25 and @entity127 officials at the state level have responded to @entity4 's health care reform , the @entity199			1
so while @entity25 elected officials rely more heavily on the support of voters who are far more likely to be uninsured , e.g. , black @entity41 ( 22 % of whom are uninsured ) and @entity42 ( 32 % of whom are uninsured )			2
@entity127 elected officials , meanwhile , reply more heavily on white voters , only 14 % of whom are uninsured			0
there are a number of contested states in the 8 % to 10 % unemployment range , including @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215			2
@entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 are all states in which a surging @entity42 population has given the @entity29 a foothold			0
@entity212 has a large and politically engaged black population as well as a growing population of college - educated social liberals , the combination of which has made the state more politically competitive than neighboring @entity118			0
@entity211 , which is still considered a swing state despite having voted for @entity25 presidential candidates since 1992 , is quite distinctive			0
it has a black population slightly larger than the national average and a high concentration of union members , many of whom are clustered in the politically important automotive industry			0
the @entity4 administration has frequently touted its support for the auto industry , the cost of which continues to climb			1
as recently as last year , former auto czar @entity241 claimed that the ultimate cost to taxpayers of the $ 82 billion of government funds invested in the @entity246 and @entity247 bailouts would be $ 14 billion			0
earlier this month , the @entity248 estimated that it would eventually cost the federal government $ 25.1 billion			0
@entity211 voters have good reason to believe that an @entity4 administration would be more likely than a @entity11 administration to offer domestic automobile manufacturers future cash infusions			1
many states with unemployment levels between 6 % and 8 % are solidly in the @entity127 camp ; for example , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267			1
these are states that have done reasonably well during the @entity4 years but nevertheless oppose his re-election			1
the states in this tier that back the president include states with large numbers of affluent college - educated voters and large minority populations , such as @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 , and also states with very distinctive demographic profiles , such as heavily @entity285 , heavily @entity286 and @entity287 , a state that is both very white and very poor			0
the swing states in this tier -- @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 -- are states in which @entity11 will have to win over large numbers of employed white voters			2
and that is also true of @entity299 , @entity267 and @entity300 , swing states in which the unemployment rate is between 4 % and 6 %			2
@entity299 is heavily white and socially liberal , and its economy has fared well in recent years			0
@entity11 will thus have to make an ideological appeal to tax - sensitive voters concerned about deficits and debt			1
a similar dynamic applies to @entity300 as well			0
@entity267 has a large minority population that is supportive of @entity4 , but it also contains a large number of tax - sensitive suburbanites who might be amenable to @entity11 's conservative message			1
@entity11 has oil - and - gas - oriented low unemployment states such as @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 locked up			1
but the incumbent is comfortably ahead in @entity320 and @entity321			0
at a state - by - state level , at least , there does n't appear to be a straight line between high unemployment levels and opposition to @entity4			1
high unemployment does matter -- but judging by the state of the race right now , it seems to matter more because employed voters , including many who 've fared relatively well in recent years , see it as a sign of economic failure than because unemployed voters will turn out against the president in droves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity341 .			2

there 's a *widespread* view that unemployment levels are hurting @entity4 's re-election chances
@entity341 : it seems @entity4 has strong support from groups more likely to be *jobless*
he says @entity11 is left in the position of having to appeal to those who have fared better
unemployment matters because even those who have done well see rate as a failure , he says
