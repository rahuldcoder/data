" the wishes that do n't seem like the basic necessity are ( often ) the ones that are the most important , " @entity32 said			1

" we want them talking about fun things and happy things			0
we do n't want to constantly remind them of how sad or tragic or challenging their circumstances are			2
we want to remind them that , ' yeah , there 's a really cool new video game out there , and you can play it and there 's nothing wrong with that			2
' " on rare occasions , there are wishes that exceed $ 500 , such as flying a family member in to attend a graduation or continuing music lessons			1

" when a child 's wish is granted , we are reassuring them that their voices are being heard			0
