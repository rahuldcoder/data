-- by the time the clock ran out on @entity5 's @entity4 halftime performance on sunday , the singer had put to rest doubts that she would give it her all			1
the 31 - year - old had been at the center of controversy leading up to her anticipated game day show thanks to her decision to use a recorded track when she performed at president @entity16 's inauguration in january			2
that left some questioning whether she 'd do the same in @entity20 on sunday , but @entity5 clarified that she would " absolutely " sing live during the game , something that seemed evident as she soared through a decade - plus of hits			1
lights out ! play halts at @entity25 as the drumbeat to her single " countdown " played in the background , an actual fan - made countdown sponsored by @entity27 ticked off the final seconds to her halftime set			0
perhaps in a nod to her noted perfectionism , viewers heard that " excellence must be pursued , it must be wooed , with all of one 's might and every bit of effort that we have " as @entity5 emerged atop a platform to take the stage			1
she began her show solo , kicking things off with an a cappella version of her single " @entity50			2
" clad in above - the - knee black stiletto boots and a leather minidress , the 31 - year - old strutted to the tune of " @entity56 , " stripping down to little more than a leotard as she performed the familiar dance moves			0
unfortunately for @entity62 fans , the singer 's husband did n't accompany her to perform his rap verse on the song			0
the best ( and the worst ) halftime shows in @entity4 history but , as expected , @entity5 did host a @entity68 reunion on the @entity4 stage			1
after performing the high - energy songs " @entity75 " and " @entity76 , " the latter of which got special effects treatment , @entity70 and @entity71 popped onto the stage to join their former groupmate			2
following a few vocal runs of " @entity81 , " the trio segued into " @entity82 , @entity83 1 , " the popular single that was also highlighted on the soundtrack of 2000 's " @entity87 " movie			0
the reunited @entity68 paid homage by pausing to replicate the iconic silhouetted pose before swinging into " @entity90 )			2
" @entity5 released that song as a solo artist , but @entity70 and @entity71 joined in on sunday 's show			1
@entity5 took back the reins from there , closing out with a performance of " @entity97			1
" " everybody , i want to feel your energy , " @entity5 said as she asked fans to keep waving their hands in the air , many of whom were equipped with blue lights			1
it was a swiftly paced 12 - minute show			0
@entity5 told press ahead of the show that she recognized how big of an opportunity she had with the @entity4 halftime gig but that she felt ready			1
" i 'm trying to learn to live every moment , because these moments are not promised to us , " she said			0
" i 've had a 16 - year career , and all of the things that i 've done have prepared me for this			0
" follow the game here -- 109 - yard returns , faltering lights and all			0

@entity5 brings some serious energy to the @entity4 halftime show

she closes it out with her solo hit " @entity97 "
