-- @entity2 officials are asking the @entity4 @entity3 to step in and temporarily block a controversial congressional redistricting plan from going into effect monday			1
the state 's attorney general , @entity7 , filed an emergency " application " with the justices , saying a map approved by a federal panel in @entity11 is " fatally flawed			1
" it would increase the number of districts dominated by minorities , especially @entity20 voters			0
the court - drawn map was imposed after @entity23 and minority groups in @entity2 challenged the original plan approved by the @entity27 - led state legislature			1
those seeking public office can begin filing their candidacies monday , prompting the state 's time - sensitive appeal to the high court			2
" elections should not proceed based on legally flawed maps that are likely to be overturned on further review , " @entity7 said in a written statement			0
the @entity3 could allow the court - approved plan to remain in effect for now , or order the judicial panel to redraw the map , a process that could shorten the time candidates would have to campaign			1
the state 's primary election is set for march			0
@entity2 is getting four new congressional seats -- more than any other state -- after the latest census showed its population grew by 4 million people			1
the plan drafted by the three - judge panel would give minorities the majority in three of those congressional districts , and could give @entity23 more seats statewide			1
" ninety percent of the growth in this state in the last decade was minority growth , " said @entity59 , a @entity23 state representative			0
" sixty - five percent of that alone , @entity62			0
so you would expect these new congressional districts would reflect the minority populations that created the opportunity			0
" @entity68 leads the @entity69 , the key plaintiff in the lawsuit against the legislature 's original map			1
under state rules , redistricting plans approved by the legislature can be challenged in court , with judges having the power to craft alternate maps			2
republicans in the state have a super-majority in the legislature , meaning they needed no @entity23 support to pass their plan			2
a similar party split a decade ago led @entity23 lawmakers to flee to neighboring @entity89 in an effort to kill the 2000 redistricting bill			0
@entity7 said the federal court 's plan is an unconstitutional intrusion into the legislative process			1
" it seems apparent that the proposed map misapplies federal law and continues the court 's trend of inappropriately venturing into political policymaking rather than simply applying the law , " @entity7 said			2
" perhaps worst , in the name of protecting @entity20 voting power , the court seems to be discarding already elected @entity27 hispanics in favor of drawing maps that may elect @entity23 hispanics			0
" the state 's @entity27 governor , presidential candidate @entity110 , supported the map passed by the legislature , but has not signed it into law while the plan is challenged in court			1
all states are required to redo their voting boundaries following the recently completed nationwide census , conducted once every 10 years			0
the court - approved plan in @entity2 will stay in effect until all the legal challenges are exhausted			2
the high court appeal is @entity110 v. @entity125 ( @entity126 ) .			0
