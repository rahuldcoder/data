-- @entity2 midfielder @entity1 wants to leave @entity3 , according to the @entity6 club 's new manager @entity4 , but @entity8 striker @entity7 wants to stay			1
@entity1 has been linked with a move to @entity11 champions @entity10 , where his former @entity3 boss @entity12 is now coach , and informed @entity4 of his desire to leave on his first day back at @entity15 following a @entity17 break			1
the 26 - year - old joined @entity3 in 2007 on loan from @entity6 rivals @entity20 , and signed a permanent four - year contract in 2008			1
" yes , he wants to leave the club			2
he has made that perfectly clear , " @entity4 told reporters at a press conference ahead of thursday 's @entity26 qualifier against @entity28 's @entity27			1
" i think he wanted to leave a year ago and he wants to leave now			0
but he 's contracted to @entity3 , so whether he leaves or not is our decision			1
" the mere fact that the player is a little bit unhappy with his situation and would prefer to leave does n't necessarily mean he will leave			0
it disappoints me , but it 's not unusual			0
" he has a two - year contract and i expect him to honor that until the day comes when the club decides to accept an offer for his services			0
" however , @entity4 had better news about the future of top scorer @entity7 , who has been linked with @entity6 double winners @entity45 after admitting to the former @entity48 manager that he was unhappy with aspects of life at @entity3			1
" as far as i know , he is looking forward to coming back here on monday , " the 62 - year - old said on tuesday			0
" he is enjoying a holiday , which is a well - deserved break as i do n't think he 's had one for three years			0
" he is spending a lot of time with his family and , as far as i know , is keeping a very low profile and not really speaking to anybody			0
" but he has told us he is looking forward to monday , looking forward to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for @entity3 next season			1
that 's what i know , and i would suggest all other reports are erroneous			0
" meanwhile , @entity3 midfielder @entity67 has been recalled by @entity68 for the friendly international with the @entity70 on august 10 in @entity71			1
the 23 - year - old was not selected for the @entity73 , but has been named by new national coach @entity74 -- who he worked with at previous club @entity76 in @entity68			2
@entity74 has called up 11 debutants in a 24 - man squad , which features just @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 from predecessor @entity84 's line - up in @entity85			2
