according to a report by @entity51 , an eyewitness said the child was hit by a police tear gas canister			1
for the next nine months , @entity34 lay in a hospital bed in a coma			1
when @entity34 's mother attempted to make a public statement about her son 's ordeal in central @entity16 in july 2013 , @entity57 journalists witnessed and filmed @entity4 riot police hitting demonstrators with pepper spray and beating one man with a club in an apparent effort to break up the demonstration			1
