@entity0 has survived a @entity2 appeal , a government shutdown and ongoing challenges by opposing politicians			1
with few exceptions , every @entity6 must have health insurance by march 31 or pay a penalty fee			2
that 's right : the marketplaces that are central to the @entity0 -- also known as @entity0 -- launched on october 1 , despite the shutdown showdown and the much - anticipated premiere of " @entity14			1
" the government has since reopened , and @entity0 is still the law			1
for most people , @entity0 wo n't make a direct impact			1
people who have health insurance through their employer , or through @entity21 or @entity22 , can continue to get it that way			2
@entity0 coverage gap : the poor caught in between but the more than 48 million @entity6 without health insurance have to enroll in one of the insurance marketplaces by december 15 in order to have their coverage start on january 1			1
the historic rollout has been overshadowed by technical issues and pessimistic predictions about how many people are really clamoring to sign up			1
here are five things that have happened since the launch of @entity0 : 1			1
sign up on @entity38 has n't been easy the launch of @entity0 was disappointing for many people who actually wanted to use the government website to enroll in health insurance			1
technical problems with the federal website , @entity38 , made signing up online difficult for some users			1
the high volume of traffic to the insurance exchange portal contributed to these problems			2
" i am the first to acknowledge that the website that was supposed to do this all in a seamless way has had way more glitches than i think are acceptable , " president @entity49 told @entity50 , a @entity51 affiliate in @entity52 , @entity53			2
a senior administration official told @entity51 that techs are working around the clock to get the site working better			1
but there also has been some confusion over user passwords			2
when @entity51 called the government help line , we were told passwords established in the first week of october were no longer valid and new passwords were needed to access the site ; the @entity70 told us that information was inaccurate			1
@entity51 's @entity72 tried to enroll in @entity0 as an experiment			1
it took more than a week for her to create a login and password			2
when that finally worked , error messages plagued her efforts when she tried to log in			2
almost two weeks went by before she succeeded in logging in and proceeding with an application			2
an insurance industry source told @entity83 's @entity82 that insurers are receiving faulty information about new customers , including duplicate forms , and missing and garbled information			0
they are in discussion with regulators and the administration to address these issues			1
next week , congressional oversight hearings will begin , where politicians will ask questions about why the rollout had so many problems			0
state sites seemed to fare better while 36 states are using @entity38 as the gateway to sign up new insurance customers , 14 states and the @entity105 are running their own sign - up sites			1
while @entity38 has stumbled , many of these individual states are doing better			1
the @entity70 says it wo n't release enrollment figures before november , but @entity51 has gotten a window on enrollment by canvassing the states running their own sign - up sites			1
as of friday afternoon , at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans			0
more than half of those -- 134,000 -- are in @entity117			0
operations are also running relatively smoothly in @entity119 and @entity120 , which each reported more than 45,000 new sign - ups			0
@entity51 reached its sign - up figures by combining what states report as " enrolled , " and what they 're calling " almost enrolled			0
" the latter group has completed the process but has not yet made an initial payment			0
also note : the numbers do n't include those who have sought assistance or enrolled over the phone or via paper application , and not all the states responded to data requests			0
not every state has had smooth sailing			1
@entity141 's marketplace did n't fully open until october 15 , two weeks late			1
in @entity143 , the @entity142 has reported repeated problems with the part of the website where people can check whether their doctors are part of a network			0
overall enrollment numbers are unclear @entity70 spokeswoman @entity152 said the administration has not set monthly enrollment targets			0
but this week the @entity155 reported it had obtained an internal september 5 memo that said @entity70 expected about 500,000 people to enroll in new plans this month			2
at the current pace , enrollment would nearly reach that figure in the 14 states and @entity105 alone			0
still , it 's unclear how many people have actually obtained health insurance since october 1			2
@entity51 has created a map with the latest numbers for individual states that are releasing enrollment information			0
the cost of care has become more clear before the insurance exchanges went live , it was unclear how much health care was going to cost consumers in each state			2
the @entity177 has released an online map showing insurance premiums before and after @entity0 based on age and sex			1
the law 's impact varies widely state to state			2
in @entity188 , for example , rates for 40 - year - old men have increased 24 %			0
in @entity190 , they have dropped 22 %			0
the @entity191 says that once tax credits are factored in , about 6 in 10 individuals will be able to find insurance for less than $ 100 a month			0
" in some states , insurance markets were already regulated to not allow insurers to discriminate against the sick			0
in those states , premiums will fall , like in @entity117 , where premiums will fall by as much as 50 % , " said @entity202 economist @entity201 , who helped design the law			0
" in other states insurers were freely allowed to discriminate against the sick			0
in those states , by ending the discrimination , we 're going to raise premiums in states like @entity210 , or some of the @entity208			0
" overall , @entity201 said , rates are going up for the young and healthy , and down for older people and people who are sick			0
is @entity0 cheap or pricey ? the verdicts are in when you do choose a plan , you should be aware of what doctor choices you have under your coverage			1
to reduce premiums and other costs , many insurers have chosen to limit the selection of doctors in certain exchange plans			0
large academic medical centers , which are often more expensive , are excluded from such plans			0
" the sticker price will be lower if the number of options are lower , " @entity227 , a spokesman with @entity228 , which is participating in five state exchanges , told @entity83			2
" the issue is how many options can you do without ? " 5			0
the shutdown came and went -- without changing much the government shutdown had no effect on users trying to sign up for @entity0 because money designated for the launch was approved in a previous session of @entity243 and did n't have to be approved again			1
yet it was partly because of the @entity0 that the shutdown continued so long in the first place			1
republicans attacked the law on several fronts , demanding first that the government defund @entity0 , and then that it be delayed for a year			1
but when the government reopened , the @entity251 came away with just a small concession related to @entity0 : two additional reports from the @entity70			1
republicans had wanted tighter income verification procedures for health insurance applicants			0
what they 'll get is a report detailing the income checks the insurance exchanges will use , and a second report that reviews how effective the verification procedures are			0
the @entity251 is still calling for an investigation into the @entity38 website 's problems			1
opinion : goodbye to the strategy @entity251 knew was a fantasy			0

@entity0 was largely *unaffected* by the government shutdown
you have to enroll by december 15 in order to start your coverage on january 1
@entity38 has been having a lot of technical issues
state sites ' success varied but seemingly did better than the federal site
