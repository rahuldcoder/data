-- calling the ruling " huge , " @entity2 mayor @entity1 on thursday reacted to a federal judge finding the @entity6 ' failure to maintain a shipping channel led to catastrophic flooding during @entity9			1
@entity1 said he hopes the court decision will " open up the floodgates " for others to file lawsuits against the federal government , including his @entity16 city			1
however , he acknowledged it 's likely the federal government will appeal wednesday 's ruling			1
@entity21 spokesman @entity20 said in an e-mail the government is reviewing the decision and has made " no determination as to what future steps it would take in this matter			2
" @entity31 district judge @entity30 ruled that the " negligence of the @entity6 " by failing to maintain the @entity35 waterway " was not policy , but insouciance , myopia and short - sightedness			1
" " for over 40 years , the @entity6 was aware that the @entity40 levee protecting @entity41 and the @entity42 was going to be compromised by the continued deterioration of the [ waterway ]			1
... the @entity6 had an opportunity to take a myriad of actions to alleviate this deterioration or rehabilitate this deterioration and failed to do so			2
clearly , the expression ' talk is cheap ' applies here			0
" @entity30 issued the ruling in a lawsuit brought by six plaintiffs affected by the 2005 hurricane , who alleged the @entity6 was liable for damages			1
the judge ruled against one couple , who lived in @entity60 , but awarded the others , from the @entity42 and @entity62 , damages ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 317,000			1
@entity1 said he had thought the ruling was a long shot			1
" this was a surprise but a pleasant one , " he said			0
the decision applies not only to the six plaintiffs , attorney @entity71 said , but also to some 100,000 homes and businesses in @entity62 and the @entity42			1
under the precedent set by @entity30 's ruling , they too will be entitled to compensation , @entity71 said			0
at a news conference thursday , @entity78 , president of @entity62 , said , " it 's a bittersweet victory in the sense that yes , we are at the table , yes , we are grateful for the judge 's ruling and for the legal team to deliver us to this point , but what a shame that we had to go through such devastation and destruction to get here			1
" at one point a category 5 hurricane , @entity9 had weakened to a category 3 storm with top sustained winds of 127 mph when it made landfall on the morning of august 29 , 2005 , between @entity96 , @entity16 , and the mouth of @entity35			2
its winds were only slightly diminished when it passed over more populated coastal areas hours later			0
more than 1,800 people died in the storm , including nearly 1,600 in @entity16			0
in @entity2 , the city 's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred			1
overall , the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people , causing more than $ 81 billion in damage			0
@entity109 , a researcher who warned of the potential for catastrophic damage from a hurricane , said the ruling is " total vindication for everybody who was involved			2
" " i think he 's called a spade a spade , " @entity109 told @entity0 by phone			0
the former deputy director of the @entity120 said the university fired him because of the investigation he led into the levee failures			0
the probe put much of the blame for the disaster on the @entity6			2
he alleged thursday that the university blocked him from being an expert witness in the case , but said he " put together a lot of the science " and reviewed the defense 's explanation to find the holes			0
" @entity9 in @entity2 was a manmade catastrophe with a hurricane trigger , " he said			1
" i saw the suffering of the people in @entity2			2
... finally there is the potential of compensation			0
" he said he intends to file a lawsuit against @entity144 , which he said has to pay him through the end of his contract , which ends in may			0
@entity144 did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment thursday			0
@entity0 's @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
