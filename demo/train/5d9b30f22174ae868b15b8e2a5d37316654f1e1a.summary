@entity1 a @entity4 public inquiry into the 2006 death of @entity7 spy @entity6 opened tuesday at the @entity8 in @entity1 , after years of wrangling over what evidence can be heard			1
in a deathbed statement , @entity6 blamed @entity7 president @entity10 for ordering his poisoning by tea at a @entity1 hotel			1
the @entity14 has always strongly denied the accusation			0
sir @entity16 , who 's chairman of the inquiry , said tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible @entity7 state involvement in @entity6 's death would be heard behind closed doors			1
the @entity4 government initially rejected requests to hold a public inquiry , but the decision was reversed last summer after @entity6 's widow , @entity6 , challenged it in court			1
she argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation			2
an inquest -- a coroner - led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in @entity37 -- had been opened after her husband 's death			0
but unlike a public inquiry , it can not hear evidence behind closed doors			2
in @entity6 's case , such evidence could involve matters of national security			0
" the issues to which his death gives rise are of the utmost gravity and have attracted worldwide interest and concern , " @entity16 said			0
@entity6 , a former @entity53 agent and fierce critic of @entity10 , came to @entity4 in 2000 after turning whistle - blower on the @entity56 , the @entity53 's successor			1
he died at a @entity1 hospital on november 23 , 2006 , after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium - 210 while drinking tea at the @entity61 in @entity1 's @entity62			1
@entity4 prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men , @entity66 and @entity67 , from @entity7 in connection with @entity6 's murder			1
but @entity70 has refused , saying @entity7 's constitution does not allow the extradition of @entity7 citizens			0
both men deny involvement in @entity6 's death			1
@entity16 said that @entity66 and @entity67 had been invited to give evidence to the inquiry by video link from @entity7 and that he hoped they would do so			0
the public inquiry will look at possible @entity7 state involvement in @entity6 's death			1
however , it will not address the question as to whether the @entity4 government could , or should , have taken steps to prevent the murder			0
@entity6 is said by his widow to have been a @entity4 agent , with a handler at @entity91 , @entity4 's foreign security service			2
in 2012 , the counsel to the inquest , @entity95 , said evidence provided by the @entity4 government showed @entity7 involvement and " does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the @entity7 state in the death of @entity6			1
" the inquest has been put on hold while the public inquiry is held			2
@entity16 , the coroner in the inquest , said the open hearings in the inquiry should conclude before @entity108 ; that is , early april			0
more than 70 witnesses are due to be called over the coming weeks , including family and friends of @entity6 , those who worked with him before his death , medical staff who treated him after he fell ill and the pathologists who conducted his autopsy , the court heard			0
the pathologists will testify wednesday on the postmortem results			0
the presence of radiation in @entity6 's body complicated the autopsy , the inquiry heard			2
a nuclear scientist will also give evidence wednesday about polonium - 210 , its qualities , where it can be found and what effect it has on the body once ingested			0
in the course of the inquiry , evidence may also deal with the contamination risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly radioactive material			1
@entity16 said polonium could have been used to " kill large numbers of people or spread general panic and hysteria among the public			0

a public inquiry into the former @entity53 agent 's poisoning death opens in @entity1
@entity6 died in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive material
