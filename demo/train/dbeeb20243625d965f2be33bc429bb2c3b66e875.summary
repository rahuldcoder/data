" he added that " we can probably solve this in about a week -- it 's not that tough			0

democrats , including the president , argue that both sides agree that the 98 % of @entity32 making less than $ 250,000 a year should avoid a tax hike when the tax cuts from the @entity181 administration expire on december 31			0
