president @entity0 is loading new missions on the @entity3 military with fast - expanding mandates and no certain end dates as he grapples with the threats posed by @entity7 and @entity8			1
evolving operations in the @entity10 and @entity11 are causing some supporters to ask whether the president , a notoriously reluctant warrior dedicated to ending foreign entanglements and getting troops home , has changed his mind			2
by committing the @entity3 military to two new crises , with no clear exit strategy , @entity0 risks the same perilous slide into " mission creep " that hounded some predecessors , who got sucked ever deeper into wars in @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
already , there are mounting questions about whether the strategy is working			0
a former top @entity3 counterterror official told @entity30 tuesday that the " imminent threat " from one of the groups targeted in an initial wave of airstrikes in @entity36 has n't abated			0
when @entity0 announced @entity3 's new war in august , he said @entity3 air strikes would only take place " if necessary " and only in @entity25 to save civilians from massacres by the marauding @entity43 radicals and to protect @entity3 personnel			1
yet less than three months later , in the newly branded @entity46 , " @entity3 warplanes have blasted @entity7 fighters , vehicles and supply lines in @entity36 , as well as @entity25			1
there are more than 1,400 troops in @entity25 and hundreds more aboard ships and in nearby countries carrying out airstrikes			0
@entity3 attack helicopters have gone into battle against @entity7 in @entity58 province			1
it is indisputable that the campaign has widened			1
@entity3 planes this weekend intensified air strikes on the besieged @entity36 town of @entity64 , and dropped arms and ammunition to @entity68 forces locked in a struggle for the strategic choke point near the @entity72 border			0
there is every sign the @entity76 operation will go on for years			0
and there is no clear idea of what success will look like , despite @entity0 's vow to destroy @entity7 's " network of death			1
" as for @entity8 , the @entity84 did n't have a role when the outbreak exploded in west africa			1
but soon @entity0 — warning the deadly epidemic could spark a national security crisis if left unchecked , announced plans to send 3,000 troops to build treatment centers and health care infrastructure			1
all this came with a caveat that no @entity3 soldiers would go near sick patients			0
soon , the @entity84 said the number of troops could go as high as 4,000			1
then last week , @entity0 issued an executive order clearing the way for reservists to be called up to fight @entity8 if necessary , amid increasing frustration in the @entity104 that @entity3 allies have not stepped up			1
@entity106 : @entity3 , @entity108 nations attack @entity7 in @entity36 on sunday , the mission expanded further when the @entity84 revealed it was standing up a rapid reaction squad to leap into action should more @entity8 cases emerge on the @entity3 mainland — opening the possibility that military officers would be exposed to infected patients for the first time			1
deepening @entity3 involvement in @entity25 and @entity36 seems to be the result of a reluctant conclusion by @entity0 that the burgeoning threat from @entity7 requires a wider @entity3 response			1
but on @entity8 , the president is personally and actively demanding the military get more involved			1
the concept of an emergency treatment team only emerged after @entity0 ordered more action from his administration in crisis meetings last week as political pressure spiked amid infections on @entity3 soil , two senior administration officials told @entity30			1
the @entity104 is walking a fine line			0
@entity0 faces skepticism from the @entity137 left , which is skittish about new wars and warnings from @entity140 that he is n't hawkish enough			1
the administration insists there will be no " boots on the ground " in the @entity7 conflict and notes an international coalition is helping to bear the burden			1
although @entity3 involvement may be deepening , it pales in comparison to the 150,000 strong @entity3 garrison in @entity25 when @entity0 took office , officials say			2
top @entity84 officials privately say the new mission list exposes the folly of current budget cuts at a time when the military is also being asked to bolster @entity0 's pivot to @entity161 and strengthen @entity162 to counter @entity163			1
top defense officials often cry wolf but they say this time they 're not playing politics , and warn that in future they may not be able to answer every time the president calls			2
it is ironic that @entity0 is parrying questions on mission creep , after being hammered by critics for " leading from behind " on @entity174 and for setting timelines for troop withdrawals from @entity25 and @entity177 rather than making drawdowns conditional on battlefield gains			2
but presidents find themselves sucked deeper into military operations for many reasons — including reverses in the field , temptations brought on by the unique capabilities of the @entity3 military or the realization that local allies are deficient			1
sometimes , they just have their hands forced by rising political heat back home			0
some or all of these conditions may apply to both the @entity8 and @entity25 operations			2
but in the @entity7 campaign at least , it 's clear those in @entity0 's inner circle have the dangers of @entity10 mission creep on their minds			1
the message is clearly that @entity0 will use force if necessary — but not beyond certain points			2
" we make no apologies for being deliberate about the use of force , particularly when it engages the @entity3 in conflicts in a region like the @entity10 , " deputy national security advisor @entity205 told @entity30 's " @entity213 " on monday			2
" the @entity3 people want a president who is going to think hard before making those decisions who ...			0
makes sure he is drawing from the lessons of @entity25 and @entity177			0
" top officials pushed back hard against the idea that @entity3 ground troops will inevitably be drawn into the fight , and comments by gen. @entity225 , chairman of the @entity226 , that @entity3 advisors could see combat advisors on the ground alongside @entity25 troops			0
" that 's not come up the chain to anybody at the @entity104			0
and i do n't anticipate that it will , " national security advisor @entity234 said on @entity236 's " @entity235 " on october 12			0
@entity239 commander gen. @entity238 rejected the idea that @entity3 operations around @entity64 represented a stretching of the military 's orders , saying last week that he was simply exploiting a chance to hit @entity7 forces massed in the town			2
" i think that we really have to remain focused on the first task , and that is to help the @entity25 restore security and stability inside of the country of @entity25 ; restore their borders ; regenerate forces to be able to help them do that , " @entity238 said			0
but there are concerns in @entity0 's political base that things are already going too far			2
@entity262 , executive director of progressive group @entity263 said that what started off as a humanitarian mission has morphed out of all recognition			0
" our members are very concerned by the prospect of a slippery slope in @entity25 and @entity36 back into another open ended war , " she said			0
rep. @entity271 ( @entity272 ) told @entity30 that @entity3 were war weary and not ready for another widening conflict			0
" we can not allow the @entity3 to be dragged into another endless war			0
since the start of @entity3 military action in @entity25 and @entity36 , i have been gravely concerned with mission creep , " @entity276 said tuesday			0
but @entity280 , a former assistant secretary of defense , said he believed the limited nature of the campaign would mitigate against public war fatigue			0
" i think now we have recognized that no one is going to transform the @entity10 , " @entity280 said , comparing the @entity7 operation to @entity3 anti-terror strikes in @entity286 and @entity24			2
" we just deal with the immediate threats and keep them from getting out of hand			0
