@entity11 argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people , not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32			0
in addition to blaming the watertight doors , the captain 's attorneys also say the ship would not have crashed had the helmsman turned it in the direction that @entity11 told him to 13 seconds before impact			2
the helmsman , @entity131 , and four others were convicted in a plea deal in july for their role in the disaster			0
a @entity137 court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements .			0
