-- " it 's about as difficult as assembling a cupboard from @entity6 , " says @entity0 , but he 's not talking about an affordable piece of @entity3 furniture			1
the 41 - year - old @entity9 sculptor and model - maker is referring to his open - source , life - size , 3d - printed robot			1
known as @entity15 , @entity0 's animatronic creation can be made by anyone with access to little more than a basic 3d printer , a few motors , a cheap circuit board and about $ 800			1
@entity0 has been developing @entity15 in his spare time since the beginning of last year and , he stresses , it 's all still very much a work in progress			2
so far the robot boasts a head , arms and hands and the torso is not far off			0
on completion of each body part , @entity0 shares the printer files and assembly instructions on his dedicated blog			1
" i 've also posted some programming instructions -- so you can make it respond to voice - activated commands , " he says			0
" it can grab hold of things , tilt its head and move its arms around in various ways ... and when i get around to building some legs , that 's when things will get really interesting			0
" the project began when @entity0 was asked to create to a prosthetic hand for a commercial photo shoot			1
he 'd recently brought a 3d printer to play with at home , so thought this would be a " good way to test it out , " he recalls			2
although he confesses to being a " coding novice , " @entity0 taught himself how to use @entity55 -- a very cheap and increasingly popular microcontroller -- so that he could get his prosthetic hand to move			1
he posted the bodiless limb to @entity59 -- a digital design file sharing site -- and was swamped with enthusiastic responses			0
the users began printing and building their own versions , and wanted to see more			0
" each individual part is small enough to be printed on the cheapest range of 3d printers available to the public " he says , noting that most of the robots you read about are both prohibitively expensive and " kind of ugly			2
" despite the sci - fi appearance of his creation , @entity0 's vision for the @entity15 robot is remarkably quaint			2
" it 's something to make with the family on weekends , " he says			0
" when she was very young , my daughter said she wanted to build a plane and various other incredible things ... this robot shows you can build anything you like			0

@entity9 sculptor @entity0 has created life - like , affordable open - source robot
the designs for each body part can be *downloaded* and built using a 3d printer
@entity0 developed the robot after creating a prosthetic hand for a commercial photo shoot
