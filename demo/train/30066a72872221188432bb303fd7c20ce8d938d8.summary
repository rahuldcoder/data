-- since the bombing of the @entity2 -- in which three people , including a child , were killed and more than 200 injured -- attention has naturally focused on what could have been done to prevent it			1
some , such as rep. @entity8 , the @entity10 @entity9 who chairs the @entity12 , have argued for increased surveillance of @entity14 in the @entity15			2
local police departments " have to realize that the threat is coming from the @entity18 community and increase surveillance there , " he says			2
others have asked whether leads were properly followed and if better sharing of information between agencies would have helped thwart the bombing			0
however , the government , with its $ 40 billion annual intelligence budget , already amasses vast quantities of information on the private lives of @entity14 in the @entity15			0
the @entity34 has 3,000 intelligence analysts working on counterterrorism and 15,000 paid informants , according to @entity38			0
exactly how many of them are focused on @entity14 in the @entity15 is unknown ; there is little transparency in this area			0
but , given the emphasis the @entity34 has placed on preventing @entity18 terrorism , and based on my interviews with @entity34 agents working on counterterrorism , there could be as many as two - thirds assigned to spying on @entity14			0
taking the usual estimate of the @entity18 population in the @entity15 of 2.35 million , this would mean the @entity34 has a spy for every 200 @entity14 in the @entity15			0
when one adds the resources of the @entity58 , regional intelligence fusion centers , and the counterterrorism work of local police departments , such as the @entity62 ( where a thousand officers are said to work on counterterrorism and intelligence ) , the number of spies per @entity18 may increase dramatically			0
@entity67 's communist - era secret police , the @entity68 , had one intelligence analyst or informant for every 66 citizens			0
this suggests that @entity14 in the @entity15 could be approaching levels of state surveillance similar to that which the @entity67 population faced from the @entity68			2
yet , as the @entity68 itself eventually discovered , no system of surveillance can ever produce total knowledge of a population			2
indeed , the greater the amount of information collected , the harder it is to interpret its meaning			0
in the majority of terrorist attacks in recent years , the relevant information was somewhere in the government 's systems , but its significance was lost amid a morass of useless data			1
what is obscured by the demands for ever greater surveillance and information processing is that security is best established through relationships of trust and inclusion within the community			2
the real missed opportunity to intervene before the bombs went off in @entity106 likely came three months earlier , when bombing suspect @entity107 stood up during a friday prayer service at his mosque - the @entity110 of @entity106 , in @entity111 - to angrily protest the imam 's sermon			1
the imam had been celebrating the life of the rev. @entity116 , which @entity107 thought was selling out			1
according to one report , @entity107 was then kicked out of the prayer service for his outburst			1
since 9/11 , mosque leaders have been under pressure to eject anyone expressing radical views , rather than engaging with them and seeking to challenge their religious interpretation , address their political frustrations , or meet their emotional needs			1
that policy has been forced on mosques by the wider climate of excessive surveillance , which means mosques are wary of even having conversations with those perceived to be radicals , for fear of attracting official attention			1
the fear is that every mosque has a government informant listening for radical talk			2
unsurprisingly , this means most people are reluctant to engage with young people expressing radical views , who instead tend to be ejected from the congregation			2
the @entity107 brothers were said to be angry about @entity15 foreign policy in @entity154 and @entity155 , possibly drawing parallels with their own experiences as refugees from @entity160 's brutal wars of counterinsurgency in the @entity162			1
but because discussions of foreign policy have been off - limits in mosques since 9/11 , they were unlikely to have had their anger acknowledged , engaged , challenged or channeled into nonviolent political activism			2
the heavy surveillance of @entity14 has meant there is no room for mosques to engage with someone like @entity107 , listen to him , challenge those of his ideas that might be violent , or offer him emotional support			1
instead , @entity14 have felt pressured to demonstrate their loyalty to @entity15 by steering clear of dissident conversations on foreign policy			0
flawed models of the so - called " radicalization " process have assumed that the best way to stop terrorist violence is to prevent radical ideas from circulating			1
yet the history of terrorism suggests the opposite is true			0
time and again , support for terrorism appears to increase when legitimate political activism is suppressed - from the @entity194 anarchists who began bombing campaigns after the defeat of the @entity197 , to the @entity198 struggling to end @entity194 colonialism , to the @entity202 's " declaration of a state of war " after state repression of student campaigns against the @entity205			0
reconstructing the motivation for the bombings is fraught with difficulty ; there can be little certainty in such matters			0
but pathological outcomes are more likely when space for the free exchange of feelings and opinions is squeezed			0
as many community activists and religious leaders argued in @entity220 in the aftermath of the 7/7 terrorist attacks on the @entity224 transport system in 2005 , the best preventive measure is to enable anger , frustration and dissent to be expressed as openly as possible , rather than driving them underground where they more easily mutate into violent forms			1
these activists put this approach into practice , for example at the @entity235 mosque in south @entity224 , by developing initiatives in the community to engage young people in discussions of foreign policy , identity and the meaning of religious terms like jihad , in order to counter those who advocate violence against fellow citizens			1
it is difficult to measure the success of such programs			0
but many see them as having played an important role in undermining support for terrorism			0
in what must seem a paradox to backers of @entity67 levels of surveillance like @entity8 , more radical talk might be the best way of reducing terrorist violence			1
no one could have predicted from @entity107 's outburst that , a few months later , he would be suspected of carrying out an act of mass murder on the streets of @entity106			1
and we do n't know what would have made a difference in the end			0
but a community able to express itself openly without fear , whether in the mosque or elsewhere , should be a key element in the @entity15 ' efforts to prevent domestic terrorism			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity281 .			1

debate has ranged widely over how to prevent terrorist attacks
@entity281 says answer is not more and more surveillance
he says mosque leaders are fearful of engaging in discussion with radicals
@entity281 : do n't toss people like @entity107 out of mosques ; confront them
