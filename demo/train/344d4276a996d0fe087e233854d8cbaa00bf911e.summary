-- as we tuck ourselves into bed at night , little do we realize that we have the chance to get some extra work done while we sleep			2
the unconscious mind has long been appreciated as a well of creativity from which some of our greatest artworks , scientific discoveries and inventions have been dredged up			1
but studies show it is also a powerhouse when it comes to processing unwieldy amounts of information			1
when making complex decisions that require us to weigh multiple factors , some researchers believe we can benefit from learning to combine our conscious deliberations with unconscious processing			1
the idea that we only use a small percentage of our brain 's capacity is " completely ridiculous , " according to @entity27 , who researches decision making and the unconscious mind at @entity29			1
" we use our brain the whole time , " he says			2
we tend to consider the time we spend sleeping , for instance , as a mentally inactive period			1
but sleep is associated with better memory performance , and " slow - wave " sleep in particular has been shown to enhance our ability to make mental connections and integrate unassociated information			1
this sort of mental heavy - lifting during sleep could be useful for discovering creative solutions to problems and could potentially help combining factors in a way that allows us to make decisions , says @entity27			1

" just imagine how great it would be if you can use that time , in a way that 's not disrupting us			2
" many people do n't like their job , but if you are wrestling with something and you can , without laying awake , help your mind process information , that would actually be pretty awesome			1
" according to @entity63 , the conscious mind is good at arranging information in accordance with rules , and performing precision maneuvers such as those involved in arithmetic			1
but compared to the unconscious , it is " low capacity " -- we can only consciously think about a certain number of factors at any one time -- and more likely to be bamboozled by irrelevant factors			1
in comparison , the unconscious is good at synthesizing large amounts of information , and privileging important considerations over trivial ones			1
in an experiment conducted by @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , @entity86 and @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , a group of subjects were asked to choose the best out of 12 apartments , and given six rules to abide by ( rent must be no more than $ 2,000 a month , must allow dogs ) , in making their choice			2
those given four minutes to consider their decision chose apartments that fit with the rules 75 % of the time but selected the best apartment just 29 % of the time			0
those who deliberated for two minutes and then were distracted for two minutes chose a rule - abiding apartment 44 % of the time , but identified the apartment with the best aggregate of attributes 58 % of the time			0
this may sound deeply mysterious , but most of us are probably familiar with the feeling of having arrived at a decision by unconscious means			1
" say you want to buy a house , " @entity27 explains			0
" you walk in and the house just feels right			0
this is the place where you think you want to live			0
there may be factors that are not easily verbalized , and that 's where your unconscious mind comes along			1
" maybe the real estate agent is diffusing the scent of freshly baked cookies in your direction			0
maybe you are just tiring of looking at open homes			0
but @entity27 's research suggests that some instincts are the result of the unconscious having correctly identified the best option			1
@entity27 explains you can actively use this kind of intuition as a decision - making tool			0
" you start with taking in all the information			1
then , you distract yourself			0
then , whatever feels right , that 's the ( option ) you go with , " he explains			0
" but after that , you check the facts			0
one house might feel really right when you 're there , but it might be built on toxic waste			0

psychologist @entity153 , who won the @entity154 in 2002 and authored last year 's " @entity157 , " has explored how our conscious thought processes are susceptible to being disrupted by irrational , subconscious influences			0
he famously distinguished between two modes of thinking : system 1 , which is " fast , automatic , effortless , associative , and difficult to control or modify " , and system 2 , which is " slower , serial , effortful , and deliberately controlled ... relatively ï ¬ ‚ exible and potentially rule - governed "			0
" we think that 's incomplete , " @entity27 says , " because there 's also a slow , unconscious process , and that 's what we 're talking about			2
" " gut decisions are really fast and influenced by all kinds of things , like stereotyping , or liking the first or last thing you see , " he explains			2
" there 's a difference between those , and a slower , more deliberate process that happens subconsciously			0

the unconscious can help make complex decisions , scientists say
while sleeping , our ability to make associations is enhanced .
