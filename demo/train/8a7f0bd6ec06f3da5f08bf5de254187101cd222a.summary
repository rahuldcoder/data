-- on an otherwise placid holiday weekend , one blog 's commentary on a change to @entity5 's terms of service created a firestorm of banter on the @entity8 : does the social network claim ownership to any user content on the site , even if the user deletes it ? @entity5 is addressing users ' concerns about its ownership of images and other content			1
@entity5 reorganized its terms of service last wednesday			1
in a blog post , company legal representative @entity21 provided an explanation			0
" we used to have several different documents that outlined what people could and could not do on @entity5 , but now we 're consolidating all this information to one central place , " @entity21 wrote			2
" we 've also simplified and clarified a lot of information that applies to you , including some things you should n't do when using the site			0
" the blog post sounded benign			0
but the brouhaha arose on sunday over a revision in the wording of @entity5 's policy over what happens to profile content -- shared items , blog post-like " notes , " photos -- when members delete their accounts			1
consumer advocacy blog @entity48 phrased @entity5 's fresh policy as " we can do anything we want with your content			1
forever , " pointing out that @entity5 's @entity55 spruce - up removed several sentences in which the company said its licenses on user content expired upon account deletion			1
and that 's where the hysteria began			0
" @entity5 should now be called @entity64 , " one @entity48 commenter proclaimed			2
" what goes in never comes out			0
be careful what you huck in there			0
" truth be told , most @entity5 users wo n't give a hoot , the same way that the flurry over the @entity75 advertising program in late 2007 was fueled by a few vocal privacy advocates while the general population did n't seem to care about it one way or the other			1
but for advocates of copyright reform and privacy , not to mention photographers and writers who may want the photos they upload or " notes " they write on @entity5 to eventually lead to some kind of profit , the news was alarming			1
some prominent @entity91 and bloggers , like @entity94 music critic @entity93 , announced that they were deleting their @entity5 accounts or pulling all uploaded content			2
so @entity5 issued somewhat of a clarification on monday to explain what the change really meant			2
" we are not claiming and have never claimed ownership of material that users upload , " a statement from @entity5 spokesman @entity101 read			1
and indeed , @entity5 's terms of service do say that " @entity109 and @entity110 " are exempt from its claims on content ownership			1
" the new terms were clarified to be more consistent with the behavior of the site , " @entity101 's statement continued			2
" that is , if you send a message to another user ( or post to their wall , etc.			0
. ) , that content might not be removed by @entity5 if you delete your account ( but can be deleted by your friend )			2
" the statement also noted a few fine points			0
first , @entity5 's license only permits it to use user content " in connection with the @entity131 or the promotion thereof , " indicating that ceo @entity133 does not plan to make the site profitable by selling scandalous user photos to the @entity136 when those @entity5 members run for elected office			1
and second , if that @entity5 content was not public , the site will respect the member 's chosen privacy settings			1
in other words , if your profile and the photos you have uploaded to it are only accessible to people on your friends list , @entity5 says it does not have the right to show those photos to anyone outside your friends list			0
@entity5 has expressed disapproval when photographs and profile screenshots normally protected by the site 's login wall or privacy settings have been made public on the @entity8			2
the site reportedly threatened gossip blog mogul @entity160 with an account deletion when one of his properties , @entity165 , posted photographs found on a socialite 's @entity5 profile			1
suffice it to say it would be hypocritical for @entity5 to publicly distribute , let alone sell , the same content itself			2
things are a little bit murky for sure , though			0
unlike the @entity174 - owned @entity173 , @entity5 does not have extensive copyright preferences , meaning that a professional photographer might want to choose a media - sharing site where there 's less of a gray area as to what can actually happen down the road			1
but as @entity5 becomes more and more of a content - sharing hub , especially now that the @entity185 product expands its reach to third - party sites , it 's likely there will be a louder cry among members -- especially those involved in creative industries who use their @entity5 profiles for professional promotion or publicity -- for clearer terms			1
ireport.com : too much information posted online ? the way they stand now , @entity5 's terms of service claim that the company does not have ownership over content , yet that it does have " an irrevocable , perpetual , non-exclusive , transferable , fully paid , worldwide license ( to ) ... use , copy , publish , stream , store , retain , publicly perform or display , transmit , scan , reformat , modify , edit , frame , translate , excerpt , adapt , create derivative works , and distribute " material as long as it does n't violate the privacy preferences set by the user			1
considering @entity5 content is login - protected by default , the outcry should be quelled somewhat by that " subject only to your privacy settings " phrasing			1
still , this is a debate that might not go away so quickly			0
@entity133 wrote a post for the @entity5 blog later on monday about the issue : " we still have work to do to communicate more clearly about these issues , and our terms are one example of this , " he wrote			1
" our philosophy that people own their information and control who they share it with has remained constant			0
a lot of the language in our terms is overly formal and protective of the rights we need to provide this service to you			0
over time we will continue to clarify our positions and make the terms simpler			0
" @entity133 continued : " we 're at an interesting point in the development of the open online world where these issues are being worked out			0
it 's difficult terrain to navigate and we 're going to make some missteps , but as the leading service for sharing information we take these issues and our responsibility to help resolve them very seriously			0
