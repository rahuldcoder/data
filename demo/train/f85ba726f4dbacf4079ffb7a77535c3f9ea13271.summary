-- " seldom set foot in your neighbor 's house -- too much of you , and they will hate you			2
" for the rival @entity6 cities of @entity8 and @entity9 , familiarity , and proximity , as that quote from the @entity13 suggests , has indeed bred contempt			1
where these two cities are concerned , there is a history of ill feeling			2
it is a rivalry that has been most bitterly played out on the football pitch between @entity8 and @entity22 but where bragging rights are up for grabs in even music and culture			1
@entity6 football faces litmus test of civility over the years as the two sides met at @entity8 's @entity33 stadium or at @entity22 's ground at @entity35 , hostilities festered and grew			1
cruel songs were sung about tragedies -- the @entity39 air disaster that affected @entity22 and the @entity41 tragedy that has cast a pall over @entity43 -- supporters were mocked and players taunted			1
the ugly sideshow to inter-city sporting endeavour reached a crescendo last season over a dispute over racism and this sunday the fires will be stoked once again when the two teams meet at @entity33			1
" it 's one of the biggest rivalries in world sport , and those rivalries -- whether it 's @entity59 vs. @entity60 or whoever -- thrive upon an element of spite , " explains author , and @entity8 native , @entity65			1
down the rabbit hole : depression in the @entity68 " there 's no doubt , though , that the @entity8 vs. @entity22 rivalry has deteriorated into hatred			1
" in almost every regard , there are alarming similarities between the two areas			0
both have a proud industrial history , have made significant contributions to popular culture and are widely viewed as modern , forward - thinking cities			0
" this is the ultimate irony , " said @entity65			0
" with their proud working - class traditions , their enormous contributions to music , art , pop culture , sport and , above all , their global footballing legend , @entity8 and @entity9 have set down a lasting international legacy			2
" they have much more in common than either cares to admit			0
perhaps that 's why the rivalry will endure			0
" blog : whatever happened to @entity95 ? but this particular feud is about more than @entity97 vs. @entity98 or @entity99 vs. @entity100			0
" it goes back to the @entity108 , " explains @entity101 ( @entity102 ) chairman @entity103 , referring to the construction of what was then the world 's largest ship canal in 1887			0
" @entity109 regard themselves as somewhat superior to @entity8 , perhaps unjustifiably but that 's the way we are , " added @entity103			1
back on the football pitch , there has been only one winner in recent years			0
@entity116 manager sir @entity115 arrived at @entity22 in 1986 with the expressed aim of knocking @entity8 , the undisputed force in @entity6 football at the time , " off their f * * * ing perch			1
" a quarter of a century later , @entity115 had clambered atop that perch as @entity22 won their 19th @entity6 title , overhauling @entity8 's record of 18			1
meanwhile @entity8 's quest for a 19th championship -- the @entity128 last won the league title 1991 -- has been the downfall of a number of managers , including club legend @entity133 and @entity134 winner @entity95			2
the consolation for @entity8 has come in the @entity134 , now known as the @entity134 , with the @entity33 trophy cabinet showcasing @entity139 club football 's top prize on five occasions , compared to three wins for @entity22			1
" both clubs believe they are the ' biggest ' in the world , " continues @entity65			0
" united in terms of fanbase and revenue , @entity8 in terms of their folklore and success			2
" but in recent months , the rivalry between the two has raised questions over whether such tribalism is out of place in the 21st century			0
@entity8 striker @entity154 was handed an eight - match ban for racially abusing @entity22 defender @entity156 during a game between the teams in october 2011			1
the issue dragged the two sets of fans even further apart , with each group launching a staunch defence of their player			0
when the two teams met again in february this year , the prematch handshake overshadowed the on - pitch action			0
@entity168 's @entity154 refused to accept the hand of the @entity170 he was adjudged to have racially abused			2
" if @entity156 plays -- and his poor form suggests he may not -- he will endure a hostile reception no doubt about it , " said @entity65 ahead of the meeting at @entity8 's @entity33 stadium			1
" but the atmosphere at these matches is always intense			0
" in the moments before kick - off on sunday , ahead of the 186th meeting between the two teams , @entity156 and @entity154 will have an opportunity to set the mood -- and an example -- to the two sets of spectators			1
" there is talk suggesting @entity156 will shake @entity154 's hand and vice versa , " said @entity103			1
" i think it is time to move on			0
it would set the right tone			0
" i sincerely hope they both bury the hatchet and there will be a handshake			0
" if ever there was a time for an air of reverence between the two clubs , it is now			0
last week saw the release of an independent report into the @entity206 disaster , a tragedy which saw 96 @entity8 lose their lives at an @entity210 semifinal in 1989			1
the report absolved fans of any blame for the fatal crush , instead pointing to the authorities who failed to take the necessary preventative actions			0
the chant " always the victims , never your fault " has been directed at @entity8 supporters by a small minority of @entity22 fans in recent times , but must outlined their opposition and strong disapproval for any @entity227 slurs			1
" nothing surprises me when it comes to football rivalries ... accepted norms are abandoned for 90 minutes , " added @entity65			0
" fans will fling anything at each other , so long as it lets them know how much they despise one another			0
" in an ideal world @entity8 and @entity22 , as two clubs whose fanbases have known football 's tragic lows along with indelible highs , would set a better standard			1
" coping with loss is something else which binds these two football institutions			0
@entity22 's darkest hour arrived on a @entity39 air field in february 1958			2
@entity254 's vibrant young team , hailed as " @entity255 " , were stopping off in @entity256 following a @entity134 tie in @entity258 , @entity259			0
in snowy , slippery conditions , the plane crashed , killing 23 people and eight of the @entity22 team			2
among the fatalities was @entity266 , a 21 - year - old midfielder tipped for superstardom who died in hospital 15 days after the crash			0
as with the @entity41 disaster , a small minority of @entity8 fans have used the crash as a stick with which to beat @entity22 's supporters			1
" must will not have the slightest truck with anyone who suggests what happened at @entity41 was n't a complete and utter failure of the state , " insisted @entity103			2
" i can remember seeing all of the coffins coming home from @entity256 after the @entity39 air disaster , the number of people killed in that was substantial and it was n't as many as were killed at @entity41			1
" i 've always felt what happened at @entity41 was absolutely monstrous ... you would have thought there would be some sort of cross sympathy between supporters , but sometimes people do things before thinking			2
" @entity8 fans had been wrongfully blamed for the tragedy for over two decades , with police statements amended to remove any criticism of the authorities			2
when asked about his reaction to the report , @entity65 replied : " relief that the truth is out there at last , delight that the families most affected by the tragedy can take steps towards a kind of peace with themselves			0
" but there 's also anger that , as a people and a club , we were unfairly tarred for so long			2
it may take time for that to heal			0
" the healing process could be aided this weekend by a gesture of goodwill and support from the @entity22 fans in the away end towards their @entity8 counterparts gathered in the fabled @entity326			1
@entity22 season ticket holder and journalist @entity329 suggests , in the ultimate show of sympathy , the club 's fans could sing @entity8 's famous anthem " @entity334 "			1
" @entity22 's manager sir @entity115 had called for an end to the hostility between his club and @entity8 , " @entity329 wrote in an article for @entity336			1
" he was not heeded by some			0
perhaps he should remind his fans that when eight @entity22 players died in the @entity39 air crash in 1958 , @entity8 offered @entity22 five players so the @entity9 club could finish the season			1
" ahead of the match between @entity8 and @entity22 on sunday he needs to make a gesture of considerable magnitude			1
and on the day the @entity22 fans should know what to sing			2

@entity8 and @entity22 will meet in the @entity68 on sunday
the people of the two cities have been rivals for over 100 years
last week 's release of an independent report into the @entity41 disaster adds to tension
a racism *row* between @entity154 and @entity156 has also soured relations
