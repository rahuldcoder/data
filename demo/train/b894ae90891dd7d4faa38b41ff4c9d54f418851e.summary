-- @entity2 's coronation as the king of @entity4 came with some anxiety over another major attack and a barrage of questions about the future of the terror network			1
since 1998 , @entity2 had been @entity11 's personal physician and one of his closest confidants , a steadfast deputy who eulogized his boss after his death last month in @entity16			1
but it took this many weeks for an @entity4 announcement on its new leader , and that suggested to some analysts that there had been head - bashing over who should take the helm			1
" it does n't suggest a vast reservoir of accumulated goodwill for him , " said @entity25 , @entity0 's national security analyst			0
when the founder and leader of any organization dies , it 's a challenge to thrive			0
in @entity4 's case , the road ahead is lined with major bumps , especially for its newly anointed leader			1
weakened in recent years , @entity4 has been losing a critical war of ideas and now faces another hurdle in the @entity40 , @entity25 said			1
" they are two big nails in the coffin , " he said			0
@entity2 will have to overcome @entity4 's troubles in spite of his personal shortcomings			1
for starters , he lacks the charisma and oratory of his former boss			1
" he wants to inspire people , not just who are joining the @entity4 organization , but people who have never joined the @entity4 organization and are trying to launch attacks in their name , " said @entity53 , a @entity0 terrorism analyst			1
" without @entity11 there anymore , they wo n't be as inspired			1
there are others in the organization , like @entity64 - born @entity63 cleric @entity62 , who were unlikely contenders but might have made a better choice			0
@entity67 speaks @entity68 , is tech - savvy and might have been one to re-energize the network with a boost or morale and fresh recruits at a time when many believe @entity4 's influence is waning			1
and @entity76 , a former @entity77 army lieutenant and long - time @entity78 , was appointed the interim leader of @entity4 after @entity11 's death			1
but @entity25 said @entity81 , sort of the defense minister for @entity4 , has never been a public face for the group			1
he is widely believed to be managing insurgent paramilitary operations in the @entity88 - @entity16 border region			0
there are also reports describing @entity2 as a prickly man who can be argumentative , divisive and difficult to work with			1
he has been accused of being a micro-manager who is not a true ideologue in the vein of @entity11			2
these are all qualities that do not bode well for an organization that has to re-energize itself in order to survive , analysts said			0
" very poorly respected , " said former @entity100 officer @entity99			0
" he is seen as a difficult man to work with			0
he has no sense among the work force in @entity4 , the kind of prestige that @entity11 had			1
" but as it were , @entity4 's central command came together and talked it out until they agreed on @entity2 , said @entity108 , military affairs analyst who is managing editor of @entity110			1
" he has been a very public official			0
he 's very well known in the rank and file , " @entity108 said			0
" there 's a lot of questions on how he 's perceived in the ranks , but even @entity11 had his detractors			2
" but ultimately , @entity108 said , @entity4 closes ranks , and the group is likely to operate in a business - as - usual mode			2
" under his leadership , there really wo n't be that many changes , " said @entity125 , who worked for 17 years in counterterrorism at the @entity100			0
" it 's not like a corporate shakeup			0
" there has n't been a successful major attack on the @entity132 since the @entity134 bombings in 2005 , and experts were divided over whether @entity2 will try to cement his throne with a dastardly act			2
@entity138 , director of international security for the @entity134 - based counterterrorism think tank @entity141 , said @entity2 will have to figure out how to unite the myriad factions of @entity4 and deal with an operational space that has been confining due to @entity64 drone strikes in @entity16			1
the organization is also suffering financially , @entity138 said			0
" he needs to do something to keep @entity4 relevant in a very difficult scenario , " @entity138 said			2
the biggest challenge may be how to gain back ideological ground in a time when pro-democracy movements are blossoming in northern @entity153 and the @entity154			0
@entity4 has been opportunistic in claiming that the mass demonstrations fly in the face of western powers , but in reality , @entity25 said , the group has been rendered irrelevant in the events reverberating through the region			2
" if you have freedom , @entity4 will go away , " former @entity77 jihadist @entity162 said in february			2
@entity108 said that had @entity11 been killed shortly after the september 11 attacks , @entity2 would have been taking over a less mature organization and might have had a more difficult time moving it forward			1
but 10 years after those devastating attacks , @entity4 is well - established , @entity108 said			2
it matters less who is in charge because the middle managers -- the bomb - makers , the men on the streets making the operations decisions -- are entrenched in their jobs			0
how important @entity4 's top job is remains to be seen			2
" but it is far more established and networked today than it was , " @entity108 said			0
still , @entity179 may not fit that easily into @entity11 's shoes			0
he also takes charge after a series of recent captures and kills of @entity4 leaders : among them were @entity188 , the most - wanted terrorist in @entity153 , and @entity190 in @entity16			0
" between the drone program , losing the war of ideas , their relevance , the bench depleted by captures or kills , the lack of success of attacks on the @entity132 -- all these things do n't suggest a great deal of strength for @entity4 , " @entity25 said			1
" that 's the problem set @entity2 inherits			0

it took many weeks for @entity4 to announce its new leader
that could be sign of *disagreement* over @entity2
@entity4 is losing the war of ideas
@entity2 lacks the charisma and oratory of @entity11
