-- after years of setbacks and controversies , the @entity2 deputy president went on trial tuesday at the @entity6 in the @entity7 for alleged crimes against humanity			1
@entity10 denied charges that include murder and persecution for allegedly orchestrating attacks that left more than 1,000 people dead after the disputed presidential election nearly six years ago			1
can mobiles help stop @entity2 election violence ? his boss , president @entity19 , has been indicted on similar charges and is set to appear before the court in the @entity22 in november			1
a third suspect , radio personality @entity23 , is being tried alongside @entity10 on the same charges			1
he also denies the accusations against him			0
in addition to the deaths , hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates in the december 2007 election torched homes and hacked rivals to death			0
@entity19 and @entity10 have denied accusations that they coordinated violence among their respective ethnic groups after the disputed 2007 election			1
in one of a number of setbacks in the run - up to the trial , the @entity2 parliament voted last week to withdraw from the @entity6 's jurisdiction , a move that would take a while to implement because it involves various steps , including a formal notification to the @entity50			1
the @entity6 said the trials would proceed despite the withdrawal			2
in her opening statement , the @entity6 's top prosecutor , @entity53 , said the prosecution would demonstrate that @entity10 and his powerful allies sought to exploit the country 's tensions for their own political and personal ends			1
the evidence would show that the outbreaks of violence " were not just random and spontaneous acts of brutality -- on the contrary , this was a carefully planned , coordinated and executed campaign of violence " that targeted perceived supporters of the ruling @entity68 party , she said			0
" mr. @entity10 's ultimate goal was to seize power for himself and his party through violent means , " if they failed to do so through the ballot box , she said			2
to do so , @entity10 built up a network of influential allies from the @entity81 ethnic group and recruited @entity81 youths to take part in attacks , the prosecution said			2
he and @entity23 , a popular radio presenter , then both used public platforms to stir up sentiment against the @entity88 ethnic group in the @entity89			1
@entity23 used his prime - time radio show to help @entity10 and his allies to " broadcast @entity93 rhetoric and even helped to coordinate attacks through coded messages , " and in this way contributed to the violence , @entity53 said			1
defense : @entity10 is an innocent man opening for the defense , lawyer @entity99 said that the case against @entity10 was based on an " exceptionally deficient " investigation and that the deputy president should never have been accused			1
@entity99 said an inquiry would be needed at the end of a trial , to ask " how was it that someone innocent has come before this court to answer charges that will be shown to be patently false ? " he said there was a " rotten underbelly " to the prosecution 's investigation , chiefly conducted under former @entity6 prosecutor @entity115 , which @entity99 said had failed to recognize the " lying witnesses " directing untrue accusations against his client			1
the @entity6 investigation was set up to target @entity10 he said , and sought to squeeze evidence into that box , " however uncomfortable , however ill - fitting , however bizarre			1
" @entity99 said his client deserved praise for being the first serving deputy head of state to come willingly before the @entity6 to face charges			2
@entity10 's electoral record demonstrated that he appealed to voters across ethnic groups and had no antipathy toward the @entity88 ethnic group , the lawyer said			2
his whole reason for being in politics was to serve the whole of @entity2 , @entity99 added			2
a lawyer for @entity23 will give his opening statement wednesday , the court said			2
' atrocities ... pain and suffering ' a representative of the victims of the violence in late 2007 and early 2008 told the court that those affected included many women , children and elderly people			2
the unrest left more than 400,000 forcibly displaced from their homes , besides the hundreds who lost their lives , @entity146 told the court			0
he represents more than 300 victims of the violence in the case			0
one victim was quoted as saying : " if there were no victims , there would be no case			0
if there was no suffering , would there be any reason to accuse the accused ? we are the ones who experienced the atrocities the court cites , because there were atrocities , and there was pain and suffering by the victims			0
" the trial is being held before presiding judge @entity176 , from @entity177 , with judges @entity178 and @entity180 , from the @entity181 and @entity182 , respectively			0
it is expected to last for several months			0
avoiding a power vacuum after the disastrous 2007 election , @entity19 and @entity10 teamed up and formed a coalition , which won the most recent poll held this year			1
jittery @entity189 nations watched as the two took office in april , raising the prospect of complicated diplomatic ties			0
@entity19 maintains that they will cooperate with the court to clear their names and has asked that their proceedings be held on different days to avoid a power vacuum			2
" we will work with @entity6 , but it must understand that @entity2 has a constitution			1
@entity10 and myself can not therefore be away at the same time , " he said			0
the court has encountered a number of obstacles leading up to the trial			0
charges against three other suspects were dropped for lack of evidence after witnesses dropped out or recanted their testimonies			0
@entity53 has previously said that some of the witnesses , including a few who were set to testify against both leaders , pulled out because of intimidation			0
lawyers for @entity19 and @entity10 have denied any witness intimidation			1
stepping in the @entity6 was set up in 2002 to try claims of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes			0
@entity2 's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the post-election violence , forcing the international court to step in			1
" the @entity6 is not , under any circumstances , a substitute for domestic criminal justice systems ; it only intervenes if the national judicial system is either unwilling or unable to ensure that justice is done , " the court said in a statement			0
that message was repeated by the prosecutor in her opening statement			0
the @entity6 intervened " only after the @entity2 efforts to establish a domestic mechanism to investigate the violence failed , " @entity53 said			1
ahead of the trial , rights group @entity244 urged @entity2 authorities to cooperate fully with the @entity6 to ensure a fair and effective process for those directly involved in the case , and for the @entity2 people			1
" six years after post-election violence rocked the country , it is high time to prioritize the pursuit of justice for the hundreds and thousands of people who lost their lives or homes , " said @entity251 , @entity244 's @entity252 program director			1
" the government 's recent efforts to politicize the @entity6 trials are deplorable , and must not be allowed to affect the commencement and future proceedings of this landmark trial			2
" the authorities should focus their energy on ensuring justice , truth and reparation for the victims of many other crimes that the @entity6 is not able to deal with			0
" eyes on @entity2 @entity2 is the second @entity276 nation after @entity277 to have a sitting president facing charges at the @entity6			1
it is @entity252 's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent , so neighboring nations are watching the trial keenly			0
@entity2 provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling @entity291 government and the politically tense @entity277 and @entity277			0
most importantly -- at least to the @entity292 -- @entity2 is a major @entity294 ally in the war against @entity297 militants in the region and has remained relatively peaceful amid civil wars in neighboring nations			0
the first phase of @entity10 's trial is expected to end on october 4 .			2
