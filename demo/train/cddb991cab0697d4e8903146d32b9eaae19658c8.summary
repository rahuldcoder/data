to degrade not only all of our politics but all of our country , and because there are certain codes of honor , written and unwritten , for all men , @entity9 and @entity10			0
indeed i wrote a book on this , laying it out , even before we knew the full extent of @entity5 's lies			1
it is hypocritical in the extreme for those members of the media who did n't take the charges and allegations against @entity5 seriously to be taking the allegations against @entity38 that we now have as seriously as they are			1
hypocritical is probably too soft a word , frankly			0
that said , @entity38 and his campaign chief of staff , @entity44 , can not go on as they have			1
there has been a pattern now that is both unhealthy for our politics and unhealthy for our polity			0
four women are not an insignificant number			1
one or two anonymous charges , perhaps			0
three anonymous charges ( where , as i understand the story , @entity38 knows of at least two of the women ) plus one woman who went very public and opened herself up to all manner of investigation are a lot			1
it is no longer insignificant			2
neither is it insignificant that the @entity38 campaign discounted the charges in the initial stories , saying they were based on anonymous sources , only to make a mockery by blaming other campaigns with less substantiation than the original stories			1
if @entity38 wants to be taken seriously as a public advocate for anything , never mind running for the chief executive and commander in chief of the most powerful and important and blessed country in the world , he needs to give a full press conference dedicated exclusively to this issue and these allegations			1
i have watched long enough and held my tongue long enough to give him the benefit of the doubt , but can no longer say this is a witch hunt , " a lynching " to use his word , or any other euphemism			0
there are allegations out there that matter and they have stacked up			2
for we who led the charge against @entity5 on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply does n't matter makes us the hypocrites as well			1
as i say , all of this is bad for our politics and polity			0
if @entity38 can not stand up to these charges , if he refuses to , then he should step out of the race			2
a man big enough to run for president should be big enough to have a full and candid press conference on all of this -- he wants us to elect him president after all , he 's asking us to trust our lives and the country 's life to him			0
this could be one of his finest moments and it could be one of his worst			0
but either way , he must confront the moment candidly and manfully			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			2

@entity127 : @entity38 should confront allegations of sexual harassment
he says four women making such claims can not be dismissed as insignificant
if @entity38 is to be taken seriously , he needs to *respond* directly , @entity127 says
@entity127 says those who criticized @entity5 's *behavior* ca n't ignore issue
