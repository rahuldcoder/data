-- the first time i met @entity4 , she was already a fan of mine , or so she said			1
with my co-writer @entity6 , i had created and written the first seven episodes of " yes , minister , " a @entity10 comedy series about the @entity12 government the first four episodes had been written during the last year of @entity15 's disastrous premiership , which led to industrial paralysis and the so - called " winter of discontent			1
" practically every trade union went on strike about practically anything			2
the unions were running the country and , it has to be said , making a pretty bad job of it			2
i had always voted @entity25 , but the last straw for me was when six baggage handlers at @entity28 were sacked after they were found guilty in a criminal court of stealing from passengers ' luggage			0
the @entity32 called a national strike , claiming the thefts were " baggage handlers ' perks			0
" it was no surprise to me that mrs. @entity4 won a big majority , and i was one of the many who voted for her			1
the @entity10 , showing its usual courage , had refused to put our series on the air until the election was over , for fear that the winner would claim a lack of impartiality and reduce its funding			1
we were flattered that a mere comedy series could be thought to have any influence over anybody , but to our surprise , it rapidly became a massive hit when it was broadcast early in mrs. @entity4 's rule			1
we learned that when it was on for half an hour every week , the business of the nation came to a standstill while mps crowded into the many bars at the @entity63 to watch it			1
of course , there could be no other possible reason for finding all the mps in a bar , so that had to be it			1
politicians and editors starting writing columns about " yes , minister			1
" @entity75 and i were thrust blinking into the spotlight like a couple of anxious moles , pleased that people liked our show but with mixed feelings about celebrity			1
fortunately , the celebrity interest focused on the actors because people , in spite of all the evidence to the contrary , seem to persist in the belief that actors make it all up as they go along			1
this put a frightful burden on @entity93 and @entity94 , the stars of the show , to be tremendously witty and erudite every time they went on a chat show			2
referring to our show , mrs. @entity4 was quoted , " its closely observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power has given me hours of pure joy			1
first of all , it suggested that mrs. @entity109 had a sense of humor , something that no one had hitherto suspected			0
i was surprised that she had time to watch it , as she was now becoming awfully bossy and i was beginning to feel that she should reciprocate : her government certainly was n't giving me hours of pure joy			2
mrs. @entity4 was changing @entity12 in many ways , both for better and worse			1
as @entity123 's @entity122 said -- not about her but about himself , of course -- " a great career is bound to involve many mistakes			2
" " yes , minister " became known as mrs. @entity4 's favorite tv show , and this worried me because the program was carefully neutral from a political point of view			1
i started telling people that @entity131 , the leader of what was known as " the loony left , " liked it a lot , too			2
my queasy feeling , as one politician after another queued up to praise us , vanished as i realized why : politicians love to watch anything about themselves on tv , and they are only interested in politics			2
also , because our program showed how the @entity146 really runs @entity12 -- our version of checks and balances and the separation of powers -- we had unintentionally given politicians an alibi			0
the public understood for the first time that if politicians did n't keep their promises , it might be because they were obstructed by the @entity146			0
so when i was invited to a big party at 10 @entity160 , i was not surprised			0
my wife and i walked up the grand staircase and there , at the top , was the @entity165 herself and a major domo to announce us			0
i muttered my name to him			0
" mr. and mrs. @entity170 , " he bellowed			1
mrs. @entity109 held out her hand			0
i was ready for a normal handshake but was quite taken aback by what happened next : " how do you do ? " she said with that curiously fake @entity177 diction as she gripped my hand and yanked me straight past her right shoulder			0
i shot into the @entity181 , crashing into a well - known tv personality , one @entity183 , knocking the drink out of his hand			0
as i started to apologize , my wife flew into the room and knocked into both of us			0
" that 's all right , " said @entity183 with a grin , " that just happened to me , too			2
" more guests were cannoning into the party like billiard balls			0
mrs. @entity109 could n't help demonstrating her strength , determination and eagerness to get on with things that were n't important			0
subsequently we were invited to dinner there a couple of times			0
and then came that dreadful sketch			2
we were to be given an award by the @entity207 , run by @entity208 , the @entity12 version of @entity210			0
a scarcely believable message arrived at the @entity10 from @entity212 , saying that mrs. t would present the award , that she had written a sketch and wished to perform it with our actors @entity93 and @entity94			1
it transpired that the scarcely believable message was not , in fact , to be believed : the sketch was written by her press secretary , @entity219			1
i learned recently that she rehearsed the sketch with @entity219 and her private secretary no fewer than 23 times			1
why were they not running the country instead , you might ask ? answer : she was losing popularity and , though not very amusing herself , she knew the power of humor			2
she was co-opting the show to make people like her more			1
@entity219 was n't a comedy writer , but as a publicist , he knew his stuff			0
the sketch was reported everywhere , seen on all the tv news shows and was carried live on radio			2
and when i was given the award , i thanked mrs. @entity208 and added , " i should like to thank mrs. @entity4 for finally taking her rightful place in the world of situation comedy			1
" there was a huge laugh , broadcast nationwide			0
the only person in the room who did n't laugh was mrs. t. i was never invited to @entity212 again			0
but soon after , the actors were given honors , the cbe			0
fair enough -- they made it up as they went along			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			1

@entity4 said @entity170 's co-written @entity10 hit " yes , minister " was her favorite show
@entity170 : mps crowded into @entity63 bars to watch themselves *satirized*
when she was losing favor , he says , @entity4 " wrote " a sketch and starred as herself
@entity170 : really written by a press secretary , it was a @entity272 move to make people like her more
