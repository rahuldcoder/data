@entity0 -- the man in line to be the next speaker of the @entity5 lost his primary tuesday in @entity7			1
the outcome of the race shocked @entity10 , challenger @entity11 and political pundits and analysts			1
the day after @entity10 's devastating defeat , those same people are trying to answer the critical questions : why and how did a well - funded , powerful , conservative member of @entity18 lose to a political novice ? 1			1
too much political calculation : @entity10 is known for smart political calculations and ambition , but this year those attributes may have cost him his job			1
one thing that 's been lacking throughout @entity10 's career is loyalty among his constituents , says @entity29 , reporter with @entity30			1
" he has always been seen as somewhat calculating , " @entity31 said , noting @entity10 changed his position on immigration in the final weeks of the campaign			1
@entity1 political editor @entity35 agreed , adding that @entity10 tried to have it both ways			2
" it was only just a couple years ago that @entity10 was seen as the voice , so to speak , for the tea party within the leadership			1
the past couple of years , he seemed to have been moderating his views a little bit , " @entity35 said			0
too much ambition : @entity1 chief political analyst @entity45 noted that as the no. 2 @entity46 in the @entity5 , @entity10 was in line to become speaker , a position he wanted			1
" ( @entity50 ) was seen as very ambitious , somebody who spent a lot of time fund - raising for the @entity46 , " @entity45 said			1
@entity10 ' earthquake ' rattles @entity55 @entity46 strategist @entity56 said @entity10 " forgot that his job was to go to @entity0 and fight for conservative ideas			1
" " he embodied -- from many of their perspectives -- sort of the arrogance of power			1
that i think has a lot to do with it			0
and along those lines ... he did n't tend to the district , " @entity1 chief congressional correspondent @entity67 said 3			2
disconnected : ambition and calculation lead to being disconnected			0
" this is @entity10 's fault			2
he was in @entity0 on @entity74 , not back in his district , " @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity73 said			1
" his confidence , his smugness , his arrogance cost him his seat			2
" this is a repudiation of @entity10 personally , that he failed politics 101 , which is to keep in touch with your district , " she said			1
" and that was an issue , " @entity56 said			0
" when you start having your operatives deal with the little people in your district -- like , oh , you take their phone calls , oh , you e-mail them back , i 'm too busy for that , i 'm this big dog in the @entity46 -- the way that @entity10 , @entity93 , @entity94 have acted , you get your rear end kicked eventually			1
turnout / enthusiasm : brat 's campaign did n't come close to matching @entity10 's deep pockets , but @entity11 made up for the fund - raising shortfall by rallying his staunchest supporters			1
" @entity102 ca n't buy enthusiasm , " @entity67 said			0
@entity1 political analyst @entity103 said the difference may lie in voter turnout , which stood at just 12 % on tuesday			0
" when you get these very low turnout primaries and the people are not paying attention to , they can be easily hijacked by activists			0
there is no question @entity10 would have won a general election in his district , " @entity103 said			1
the role of the right : @entity118 , @entity1 senior media correspondent , said conservative media corralled the troops to vote for brat in numbers that @entity10 did not match			2
" @entity124 , for example , to name one talk radio host , was very supportive of brat , even held a rally for him in @entity7 this time last week			0
the top of her website today said , ' @entity126 today			0
' other radio hosts also supported him			0
and i think they are going to be getting credit in the days to come			0
tonight on @entity137 , @entity136 called @entity124 instrumental to this victory , " @entity118 said			0
... and the left : @entity140 , diirector of the @entity141 said @entity142 , who make up 43 % of the district , played a role as well			2
" there was a major outreach to @entity142 in that district , " @entity140 said			0
" you had brat operatives going to @entity142 committees , even on election eve , asking them to go to the polls to get rid of @entity10			2
it had nothing to do with @entity11			2
there were robocalls to @entity142 in that district , wanting -- telling democrats come out to the polls			0
he was a casualty of a bigger battle : " ( @entity10 had been ) taking conservative position after conservative position after conservative position , but almost 100 % was n't enough for these folks			2
and i think of it as a major message to @entity46 leadership , " @entity103 said			0
@entity45 said that @entity10 's loss to a challenge from the right , despite rock - solid conservative credentials , puts the @entity46 at a crossroad			1
" i think they 're kind of at the proverbial fork in the road			0
they can either be a congressional party and win these congressional seats by going further to the right , or they can become a presidential party in which you have to move to the middle			0
" @entity10 was not only an establishment figure , @entity46 rep. @entity187 of @entity188 noted , but was deeply involved in negotiating with the @entity5 to end the government shutdown last fall			1
" and that was used against him			0
and so the message to us is , negotiation or compromise could get you beat , " @entity187 said			0
@entity196 is the @entity197 who no longer has to face @entity10 5 aftershocks from @entity10 's stunning upset loss			2

not long ago , @entity10 was seen as the @entity202 voice within @entity5 leadership
to some , @entity10 embodied the arrogance of power
@entity10 gets blamed for being in @entity0 on @entity74 , not in his district
@entity11 made up for the fund - raising shortfall by rallying his staunchest supporters
