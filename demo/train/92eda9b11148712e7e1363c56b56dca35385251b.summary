@entity0 probably did everything right			1
its staff worked every day to create a climate of kindness over bullying			2
they had lockdown drills that trained everyone to stay low and quiet in the event of an emergency			2
a security system introduced this year required visitors to ring a bell , sign - in and perhaps produce a photo id			2
after 9:30 a.m. , the doors were locked			2
and now it 's the home of the one of the worst school shootings in @entity19 history			1
twenty children dead and eight adults , including the shooter			1
those who know the world of school security are already predicting what comes next : a strong reaction -- maybe an overreaction -- by parents , schools and legislators who want to take action			1
politicians will be elected on platforms of school safety			1
vendors will turn up with technology and security plans to sell			0
schools will rewrite their crisis plans and run extra drills			1
it happened after the shooting at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , in 1999 , and again after the 2007 massacre at @entity47 and within a few months or years , it 'll be back to cutting security budgets and fighting for time to train staff and teachers on safety protocol			1
psychologist did n't come back alive " the vast majority have a crisis plan on paper			0
it 's much more common that we find those plans are collecting dust on the shelf and they 're not a part of the culture or the practice , " said @entity58 , a school security consultant			1
" i do n't believe we need to throw out the book of best practices on school safety			1
i think we do need to focus our resources , times and conversation back on the fundamentals			0
" every school should have crisis teams that review their plans regularly , he said , and staff members who greet and challenge every person who comes to the door			1
they should have locked doors , safety drills and parents who know where to find their kids , just in case the unthinkable happens			0
schools need counselors , psychologists and officers building relationships with kids , because they are the best line of defense , @entity58 said			1
is there no safe place ? " as they 've cut back on the human element , they 've tried to compensate by leaning on and pointing to physical security measures , " @entity58 said			1
" they love to say ' we have cameras			0
' " the details about @entity0 are n't clear yet			1
did the suspect , @entity106 , enter before the doors locked ? did he say anything to anybody beforehand , leave any trace of his plan ? could a locked door or a kind word possibly have stopped him ? " the saddest thing about these incidents is they 're over so fast , a law enforcement response almost never accomplishes anything , " said @entity114 , co-author of " @entity115 : the @entity121			1
" shootings happen in places " exactly like this , " @entity122 said -- rural areas or exurbs where violence never seems to be a problem			0
but the typical perpetrator belongs to the school community , someone staff would easily let in			1
you ca n't fault @entity0 's administrators and teachers , said @entity122 , dean of @entity137 's school of arts and sciences			1
they stayed in lockdown and stuck to plans that might have saved kids ' lived			0
stories are emerging about teachers who pulled kids to safety and demanded proof that police were really who they said they were			1
it probably would n't have changed anything in @entity0 , @entity122 said , but every school would be wise to re-evaluate its security measures			1
@entity122 advocates for more school resource officers , unarmed law enforcement representatives , who kids are taught to trust			1
there are n't many at elementary schools , she said , and their positions are often among the first cut from middle and high schools in tough economic times			1
" kids have to know that they can come forward and what they 'll talk about is confidential , but also taken seriously , " @entity122 said			1
" they are the ones privy to leakage of intentions and rumors			0
trapping that information and getting it to the right place is a very important defensive measure			1
" the kids in elementary school today were n't even born when the @entity43 shooting took place , she said			1
how could they know such a thing is possible , that there 's history behind those lockdown drills and buzzer systems ? after the @entity43 shooting , districts renovating and building schools studied what they could do to make them safer , architect @entity187 said , and the changes are clear on some campuses			1
they began to build single , prominent entryways , and reduced landscaping that provided a place to hide , @entity187 said			0
they shifted restrooms away from entryways and moved major mechanical and electrical systems so they could n't be shut down or vandalized from the outside			0
they put simpler keyless entry systems on doors to make it less tempting to prop them open			2
they planned elaborate announcement systems that let police address a shooter without speaking to every classroom			2
" year by year , they 're trying to do what they can with the money they have , " said @entity187 , chairwoman of the board for the @entity209			0
" anything that is going to make it harder to get through a building			2
" but in recent years , schools also came to value natural light and open spaces that allow classes to collaborate			2
walls once made of brick are now made of glass			0
they fold up and disappear , if they 're there at all			0
it 's better for learning but tougher for security , @entity187 said			0
" it 's becoming a challenge , " the @entity230 - based architect said			0
" we 're breaking down the school into more small learning communities , the school within a school			2
you might not have a wall , so securing your hallway or pod is how you do it			0
" if there 's a shooting , an explosion , an illness , it can sometimes be limited to one room or one hallway			2
at @entity0 , students were killed in two classrooms			1
but plenty of schools do n't have even those options			2
@entity255 is superintendent of the @entity256 , a rural district northwest of @entity258 with just a few hundred students			0
he spent friday afternoon celebrating @entity260 with his elementary school students , pretending not to know the news			2
" oh my gosh , " he thought			0
" i have to take care of these kids			0
" his schools will review their crisis plans and drills this week , he said			2
but there 's no school law enforcement , and because it 's a rural area , any police response could take a while			1
his middle and high school students circulate between five buildings during the school day , so they ca n't lock doors			2
security systems cost money , he said , and when he 's cutting teachers , how could he hire a police officer ? " days like ( friday ) make you think , is that the right decision ? how can we make our systems airtight ? " he said			1
" you know ultimately , you ca n't			0
" after @entity43 , after @entity47 , after @entity0 , security experts said that will be the hard reality for every school , politician and parent to accept			1
" there is not a single safety measure that anyone could have put in place at that school that would have stopped what happened , " said @entity293 , the school safety specialist for the @entity295			1
" when you allow absolutely insane people to arm themselves like they 're going to war , they go to war			0
" he calls metal detectors useless			0
buzzer systems are just locked doors			0
lockdown plans are important to keep people safe , but they do n't keep evil out			2
" in a school , your only real protection is kids trusting you with information , " @entity293 said			1
" if they do n't trust you with information and someone is planning to do something , it 's a matter of how many will be killed before you kill him			2
" when it comes to shootings , @entity293 calls himself a cynic			0
over the course of 12 seconds in 1997 , one of his students shot and killed three classmates , wounded five more , then put the gun in @entity293 's hand			0
@entity293 was principal at @entity334 in @entity335 , @entity336 , then			0
@entity338 was later sentenced to life in prison			0
@entity293 stayed on at @entity334 long enough to see survivors graduate			0
the school 's culture changed overnight , he said , to one of support and trust			2
after three funerals , the bullies changed			0
he retired and built another career talking to high schoolers about security			0
he tells them to pay attention to what they hear and tell people who can help			0
that , he promises , works			0
he 's not in @entity0 yet , he said , because , well , what could he say to 6 year olds ? what could he say to their parents to make this better ? nothing , he says			1
people are sharing their concern and sadness over the @entity0 school shooting			1
what are your thoughts ? share them with @entity373 .			0

the school in @entity0 did a lot right , but the shooting happened despite their efforts
children have to feel safe coming forward with information they may have
such violent incidents occur so *quickly* that a lot of damage is done before police can respond
since the @entity43 shooting , many new schools are designed to make *attacks* more difficult
