-- as a nation , @entity1 might be better known for its round rather than oval - ball prowess but the @entity6 host has been granted automatic spots in the rugby sevens at the @entity9			1
@entity11 is making its @entity13 bow in @entity14 and increasingly teams in the @entity1 city are seen practicing on the iconic @entity17 and elsewhere - overall in the country , rugby participation in @entity1 has risen by 25 % since 2011			1
on the international stage , @entity1 is far from a powerhouse of the sevens discipline but the @entity23 has now decreed that , as hosts , it will automatically qualify for both the men 's and women 's tournaments			1
it means the qualification criteria for the rest of the @entity13 hopefuls is even tougher with one less place up for grabs			0
@entity23 chairman @entity34 explained : " the decision to include @entity1 is good for rugby , good for @entity1 and good for the @entity13			1
@entity37 in @entity1 is experiencing rapid growth and inclusion will generate further impetus and excitement while giving the @entity1 rugby family and sports fans across the nation something really special to look forward to at their home @entity13			2
" we are excited and honored for rugby sevens to be making its @entity13 debut in @entity14 and believe that the @entity13 will be great for rugby and rugby will be great for the @entity13			2
" @entity37 is thought to have been brought to @entity1 by @entity53 immigrants in the @entity54 , the first recorded match taking place in 1888 in @entity56			0
but the game has struggled to take off , in part due to the vast size of the country and partly because of the lack of infrastructure			0
the @entity23 are seeking to address that and last year injected $ 400,000 into rugby in @entity1 in order to increase participation , while 9,000 children have been introduced to the sport via its @entity69			0
@entity14 will also host round three of the @entity70 from 21 - 22 february .			0

@entity23 grant automatic qualification spots to @entity1 men 's and women 's teams for 2016
chairman @entity34 calls it " good for rugby , good for @entity80 and good for the @entity13 "
sevens will make its @entity13 bow in @entity14 with *12* - team tournaments for both sexes
