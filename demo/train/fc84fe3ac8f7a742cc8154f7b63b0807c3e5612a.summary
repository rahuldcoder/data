-- the former president of @entity2 did n't candy - coat it : @entity5 's political fund - raising system , he said , amounts to legalized extortion			1
" i feel extorted , " @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity8			1
" every time i wrote a check i felt that it was a form of extortion , the price of entry , because of the reception that you got when you contributed versus the reception when you did not contribute			0
" @entity7 , who ran @entity2 from 2005 through 2008 , said he was constantly being asked for political donations , by members of both parties			1
it 's against @entity2 policy , he said , for corporate contributions to be made			2
so any donations came out of his own pocket -- something , he said , he felt forced to do			2
@entity7 said he and other oil executives were summoned to more than a dozen @entity28 hearings in 2008 when the retail price of gasoline began to skyrocket			1
in one hearing , a member of @entity32 suggested that nationalizing @entity5 oil companies might be a way to tamp down prices at the pump			0
not long after one of those hearings , @entity7 told @entity0 , several members of @entity32 pressed him for political contributions			1
and it 's all perfectly legal			2
the influence of politics and money has become a legal game of extortion , critics say , made all the more insidious because the so - called extortionists are politicians who write the laws and legally manipulate the system for their own gain			1
" it is a feeding frenzy that 's going on , " said @entity53 of the @entity54 , a nonprofit research group			2
he 's written a book called " extortion , " describing @entity5 's political system as one where lawmakers learn how to transform power into cash			1
" i think we need to somehow break the back of the ability of politicians to leverage their position to extract donations , " @entity53 said			1
" most fund - raisers will tell you the place that you start raising money is from people who ca n't say no , " said @entity53			1
" so if you 're a government contractor or you 're somebody that 's doing business with the state or federal government , you 're going to be put in a position where you 're going to be expected to raise funds , because if you do n't , the fear might be that you 're going to lose the contract			2
" @entity7 , the former @entity2 executive , told @entity0 he realized he would have to cough up several thousand dollars of his own money each year , " if i am going to do my job			2
" he said the system is " pay to play " and he agrees that the word " extortion " is accurate , " as harsh as a word that is			1
" " we talk about corruption in @entity93 countries			0
in this case , the corrupters have written a law to make it legal to the corruptees			0
and i consider that atrocious in the name of democracy , " @entity7 said			0
@entity53 did n't seem surprised by @entity7 's story			0
" you hear that from businessmen all the time -- that they come to @entity107 , they appear before a congressional committee , they are grilled on a matter and it is made pretty clear after the fact that , ' if you make donations or if you do fund - raising for me , i might understand issues a little bit better as far as you are concerned , ' " @entity53 told @entity0			1
it 's just business , said @entity7			0
but he said it 's also a process that includes a healthy dose of political theater			2
" the political theater of the hearing matters to them			0
and that 's exactly the mindset which i used to go into the hearing , " @entity7 said			0
to please the powerful politicians , he found himself asking himself questions like " what role shall i play ? " " if you 're testifying , you 're in the subordinate role because the members are always up in a dais looking down at you , " said @entity7			2
" so you know you are subordinate to them			0
this is their town , their home , you 're an invited guest			0
but when the hearing is over ... the curtains close on the theater			0
it 's back to business			0
and business is raising money			0
" now , more than five years after leaving @entity2 , @entity7 chairs the @entity143 and serves on an advisory committee for the @entity5 @entity145			0
@entity0 took a look around @entity28 during a single day last november			1
our goal : to track the daily fund - raising parade			1
we found 13 political fund - raisers which took place between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m. we were able to videotape at least eight of them			1
join us over the coming year to see how @entity0 followed the money , the fund - raisers and the politicians to reveal how it all works			1
