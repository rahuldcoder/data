@entity0 -- the appearance of mysterious giant circles on an ice - covered pond has some @entity7 residents wondering if they 've been visited by beings from another realm			1
during an unseasonable spring snow storm last friday , @entity10 of @entity11 was stunned to see the strange pattern that had formed on the pond she built 10 years ago behind her home			1
the large circles resembled a black and white twister game			2
@entity18 posted a photograph of the pond on @entity21 , with a link to @entity1 affiliate @entity24 's @entity21 page , and it received hundreds of comments speculating about what caused the phenomenon			2
" people were suggesting all kinds of crazy stuff , " @entity18 told @entity1			0
" there was everything from ducks swimming in circles to bodies burning to @entity36			1
" she got a laugh out of one explanation in particular -- flatulent fish			2
and the most bizarre of all -- could there be aliens roaming around this quaint town south of @entity45 ? it 's likely a more mundane explanation , one expert says			2
" there are lots of processes in nature that involve water and convection -- sometimes salt and fresh water , sometimes cold and warm water , sometimes a bit of both			1
the oceans do this at a range of scales , and it would n't surprise me if this is another one of those phenomena where water convects because of a subtle change in temperature , " said @entity60 , a glaciologist at the @entity61 of @entity62			0
freeze and thaw cycles common at this time of year cause warm water to rise from the bottom of the pond , disrupting ice formation because of the water 's temperature and motion			1
" it is n't really a phenomenon			0
pond circles are @entity86 's artwork , " @entity18 said			1
" but it took just one photo for people to go wild and then it had a life of its own			0
" some scientists are glad the photo has caused such a commotion			0
" everyone who saw that photo and thought , ' i wonder how that happened ? ' was doing what scientists do every day , " said @entity96 , an associate professor at the @entity61			0
" it 's great that people pay attention to these kinds of events and use them to exercise their curiosity about the world around them			0

the circles appeared after a *snowstorm* last week , @entity10 says
scientists say warm water from the bottom of the pond is likely the cause
some speculate that ducks , fish or aliens were *responsible*
