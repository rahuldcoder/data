the @entity3 's sweeping collection of @entity5 phone records as part of a national security leak investigation has had a chilling effect on sources , the news agency 's top executive said on wednesday			1
" some of our long - trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking to us -- even on stories that are n't about national security , " @entity5 chief executive and president @entity11 said at the @entity12			1
" in some cases , government employees that we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to us by phone and some are reluctant to meet in person , " he said			0
the @entity3 subpoenaed and subsequently obtained two months of @entity5 phone records as part of an investigation of its may 2012 coverage of a foiled airline bomb plot in @entity29			1
toll records would show what numbers were dialed from the @entity5 lines and what numbers dialed in , but would not provide any information on the content of conversations			2
no reporters were singled out as potential criminals , but the scope of the subpoena surrounding leak of classified information provoked outrage among media and concern from civil libertarians , privacy advocates and some members of @entity50			1
a second , similar case involving a @entity54 reporter 's e-mails regarding a separate leak of classified information on an unrelated national security story added fuel to the media controversy			1
president @entity60 has said he was " troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable			0
" @entity11 said the @entity5 could have helped the @entity3 narrow the scope of the subpoena had it " come to us in advance			2
" he added that a court could have decided the matter if the @entity3 and the @entity5 did n't agree			1
" there was never that opportunity			0
instead , the @entity3 acted as judge , jury and executioner in private -- in secret , " he said			2
the @entity3 defended its scrutiny , saying previously that it followed its own regulations in acquiring subpoenas and exhausted other methods to find out who might have leaked the information before seeking phone records			1
it said investigators conducted more than 550 interviews and examined tens of thousands of pages of documents before issuing subpoenas involving phone lines			0
@entity3 rules call for negotiations with news organizations on such issues unless there is a " substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation			0
" attorney general @entity98 has subsequently said he will never prosecute reporters for doing their job			0
@entity11 , who is also a @entity101 lawyer , worries about precedent			0
" if reporters ' phone records are now open territory for the government to secretly monitor , then news sources will be intimidated from talking to reporters			1
the @entity5 is not going to be intimidated , but our sources will be , " @entity11 said			2
@entity11 says other news organizations also have experienced sources worried about speaking to them			0
" this chilling effect is not just at @entity5 ... journalists from other news organizations have personally told me ( the @entity3 's seizing of @entity5 's phone records ) has intimidated sources from speaking to them , " he said			1
@entity98 has launched a review of @entity3 guidelines on investigations involving the press , and has met with media executives about it			0
@entity60 has given @entity98 a july 12 deadline to come up with some suggestions for possibly changing the approach .			0
