@entity0 -- there is an industry in this country that is making billions in profit while average americans are struggling to fill up their gas tanks			0
@entity8 says universities should share the wealth from the tax break on their endowments			1
it 's an industry that made an average profit of nearly 17 percent in 2007 while most @entity6 could barely keep up with inflation			0
it 's an industry whose members paid a grand total of zero dollars in tax on their endowments last year			0
are you outraged ? are you ready to call on @entity21 to investigate or demand that a " windfall " tax be placed on these egregious profits ? well put down the phone because the industry i 'm talking about is @entity28			0
and make no mistake , it is an industry			0
the top five college and university endowments reported a combined value of over $ 100 billion at the end of 2007			0
that 's five funds , a hundred billion in cash			0
not a nickel in tax			0
not an ounce of outrage			0
@entity42 , which has the largest endowment in the country , has a total of $ 34.6 billion			1
to put into perspective just how much money that is , consider that the largest charitable foundation in the world , the @entity48 , has a total endowment of $ 37.3 billion			2
but while their financial statements may look similar , their missions are n't			2
the @entity48 is working to cure malaria , develop new tuberculosis vaccines , and stop the spread of @entity58			0
most of our colleges and universities are only working to spread the radical political views of some of their professors			1
let me be clear : i have absolutely no problem with @entity42 or any other school having billions in cash			1
in fact , good for them ! i have no problem with @entity42 posting an unbelievable 23 percent rate of return on their money last year			1
the truth is , i 'm jealous of it			0
i have no problem with the fact that if you project @entity42 's endowment out using their historical rate of return they would have over half a trillion dollars in 20 years			1
i do n't even have a problem with @entity42 not paying one dime of tax on any of that money			1
what i do have a problem with -- and it 's a big one -- is how @entity42 spends that money			1
or , maybe it would be more accurate to say how @entity42 , does n't spend that money			1
schools with large endowments ( at least $ 500 million ) reported spending an average of 4.4 percent of their stockpiles in 2007			0
meanwhile , those same schools made an average of over 19 percent on their money			2
but i also have another problem , and that is how these sanctimonious institutions who are so good at complaining about the injustices of our government are nothing but really highly educated hypocrites			1
for what 's been estimated to be about $ 300 million a year ( less than 1 percent of their endowment 's value ) @entity42 could completely waive tuition , room and board for every single one of their students			1
instead , they announced an increase in those fees of about 3.5 percent for next year			0
being a student at @entity42 will now cost a staggering $ 47,215 a year			1
does n't @entity42 know how many millions of @entity6 are struggling to afford college ? do n't they want to pay their fair share and help those who are less fortunate ? some politicians in @entity128 who ca n't stand to see so many billions dangling just out of their reach , have proposed a new tax on large university endowments			1
they do n't have a cute name for it yet , so let 's call it an " endowment windfall tax			2
" under their proposal , all endowments over a billion dollars would be taxed at 2.5 percent , a rate any wealthy individual or corporation would salivate over			0
the tax would net the state over $ 1.4 billion a year , which is a lot of money considering that @entity146 currently receives about $ 1.8 million a year from the school			2
so how did @entity42 , which is basically the @entity148 of higher education ( minus the accusations of price - gouging ) , react to that proposal ? in a word , conservatively			1
" you 'd be taxing success here , " @entity154 , @entity42 's associate vice president for government , community and public affairs complained in a quote that will soon be framed and hung in my office			1
" over time , this would put us at a real competitive disadvantage , which would drastically hurt the @entity164			0
" no @entity154 , you 're looking at it the wrong way			0
these politicians are n't trying to hurt you , they 're just trying to level the playing field			2
@entity170 for women down the road is struggling and here you are making billions			0
if they could just redistribute some of your profits to @entity176 then everybody would be happy			0
does anyone else find it ironic that universities overflowing with liberal professors ( a 2005 study revealed that 72 percent of professors view themselves that way ) embrace conservative values only when it suits them ? as a conservative , i do n't believe in taxing anyone just because they have a lot of money or are an easy target			1
that applies to individuals , businesses and universities			2
i believe that taxing success discourages success , and that 's not what @entity6 stands for			0
but i also believe in something else : consistency and accountability			1
and that 's where most of our colleges and universities fail miserably			1
besides , @entity42 , you 're in the wealthiest 1 percent			2
is n't it time to help those who are less fortunate ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			2

@entity8 says he has a problem with how @entity42 does n't spend its money
universities run by highly educated hypocrites , @entity8 says
@entity8 says most colleges fail on consistency and accountability
