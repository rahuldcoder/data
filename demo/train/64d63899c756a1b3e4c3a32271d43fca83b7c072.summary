-- a @entity2 police officer was caught on an audio recording allegedly making racial slurs during an encounter with some young black men outside a bar in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the incident took place in 2012 , according to a report this week by @entity14 - @entity2 reporter @entity13 , which included audio of the the officer 's remarks			2
and a panel assembled to conduct a formal disciplinary hearing subsequently recommended that the cop , @entity21 , be fired			1
but @entity23 chief @entity22 overruled the decision , issuing a 65 - day suspension instead			1
apparently , chief @entity22 thinks it is tolerable to have officers on the beat who use the n - word -- as a bar security guard alleged @entity33 did -- and refer to young black men as " monkeys , " as @entity33 can be heard doing on the audio recording			1
now , i acknowledge @entity33 was off duty			0
but a law enforcement officer is sworn to uphold and enforce our laws equally among our citizens without regard to skin color , and has no right to bigotry even while off duty , even while upset or even while impaired			0
when i think about officer @entity33 's alleged encounter , i am reminded again of the troubling overrepresentation of black men in the criminal justice system			1
nearly 1 of every 100 @entity52 serves jail time , and there are nearly six times as many black inmates as there are whites			2
is that because some cops think the use of the n - word is acceptable or think of young black men as " monkeys ? " or perhaps it has something to do with what president @entity67 addressed when he remarked that " @entity70 young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system , that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence			1
" or , more likely , it 's a self - reciprocating reaction to both			0
if some cops exhibit racism , are black men justified in being distrustful of cops ? if black men are more likely to be seen as perpetrators of violence , are cops justified in being more wary of black men ? should you be tempted to ask yourself " which came first ? " -- that will take you back to a time when virtually all black men in @entity52 were in shackles , and that line of thinking is n't productive			1
a better question to ask is " who is in the best position to break the cycle ? " the answer is this : the person in authority			0
in our communities , police officers are the face of authority			2
they are the first responders to calls for justice or help			2
when they respond to a call , they decide how to treat the parties involved			0
they decide whether or not to make an arrest			0
as a society that struggles with a deep race problem , we have to trust that our police officers are not racists			2
when we encounter a cop who displays blatant bigotry -- even when he is off duty -- we can not tolerate it			2
by allowing the officer who allegedly made these racial slurs to remain on the force -- even after a disciplinary board rules that he should be fired -- @entity23 chief @entity22 has sent a message to all young black men in @entity2 that his officers are not to be trusted			1
this could have disastrous consequences for all the @entity23 officers who are honorable and serve their community with integrity and who treat citizens with respect			1
allowing racist officers to remain on the beat institutionalizes racism and it endangers good cops			1
in the face of this , here are some things to remember if you 're a young black man , and you encounter a racist cop : be better than the cop			1
if you allow an officer to provoke you , you 're much more likely to be arrested			0
whatever you say will be put in the police report , and it will be used against you by the prosecutor			0
if you run , or resist , or fight , it will be used against you			0
it makes it harder for defense attorneys like me to help , and in the end , one gross injustice can be compounded by another			0
but that does n't mean anyone should stand by and do nothing			0
more and more police departments record interactions between citizens and police			0
when there is evidence of racism in these transactions , report it			2
report it and demand action			0
we can start with demanding action from @entity23 chief @entity22 .			1
