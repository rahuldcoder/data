@entity0 -- the @entity3 of @entity4 , @entity5 , approved tuesday evening the hiring of an independent consultant to reform the city 's police force and review last month 's arrest and subsequent death of a homeless schizophrenic man , a spokeswoman said			1
before a gallery of residents angry about the death , the council voted 5 - 0 to award a one - year $ 50,000 contract to @entity19 , a consultant whose rate is $ 260 an hour , to examine the police department 's policies and practices , city spokeswoman @entity13 said			1
the council then approved 4 - 1 a second contract , also for up to a year , paying @entity19 $ 30,000 to prepare a public report looking at the july 5 incident involving police and the death of @entity30 , @entity13 said			1
@entity19 told the council he will begin investigating the death after the @entity35 district attorney 's office completes its own inquiry into the incident , @entity13 said			1
@entity19 is currently chief attorney for a civilian oversight committee created by the @entity39 supervisors to monitor the sheriff 's department			2
@entity30 , 37 , died five days after what the @entity35 district attorney has called " a violent and desperate struggle " last month with @entity4 police			1
meanwhile , a @entity0 attorney said he is planning to file a police brutality lawsuit in federal court this week against @entity4 officers in a new unrelated case			1
but one of the officers in that case was also involved in the @entity30 arrest , said the attorney , @entity55			1
@entity55 is also representing @entity30 ' father , @entity56 , who is alleging that his son was a victim of police brutality and has notified @entity4 city officials that he plans to pursue legal action against them			1
in the second alleged instance of police brutality , @entity61 , 31 , of @entity35 , @entity5 , had an altercation with @entity4 police officers in october that was recorded on his @entity66 and posted on @entity67			1
@entity61 was n't seriously injured , @entity55 said			0
@entity61 , who works in an automation factory , was acquitted of battery against an officer and resisting arrest -- both misdemeanors -- last month , @entity55 said			0
on tuesday , acting @entity4 police chief @entity73 , named to the post last week , said he was concerned about the @entity76 case based upon information brought to his attention			0
he has ordered an internal affairs investigation " to determine what happened that evening in october 2010 and the court case this year , " said police spokesman @entity83 @entity85 " there is a strong possibility that we arrested the wrong person that night ( @entity61 ) , " @entity85 said in an e-mail to @entity1			0
@entity55 claims the @entity66 video by @entity61 contradicted the police report and an officer 's testimony in the case			2
how @entity4 police officers write their reports is also a matter of controversy in the @entity30 case because officers were allowed to view a videotape of the @entity30 arrest before filing their reports , @entity55 said tuesday			1
in the federal lawsuit to be filed later this week , @entity61 will claim conspiracy to falsify arrest reports , conspiracy to violate the civil rights of a citizen and police brutality , @entity55 said			0
@entity55 said the suit will support his claim that the @entity113 engages in a " pattern or practice " of civil rights violations			0
fullerton deputy city attorney @entity117 declined to comment tuesday on the anticipated legal actions by @entity30 ' father and by @entity61			1
touchstone and police spokesman @entity85 also declined to comment on @entity55 's accusation that one @entity4 police officer was also involved in both cases			2
@entity55 identified that officer , but city officials declined to confirm the name tuesday			0
the attorney for the six officers did n't return phone calls tuesday			0
meanwhile , @entity30 ' father and some angry residents have been pressing city officials to release a videotape of the six @entity4 police officers engaged in the arrest and alleged beating			1
city officials have declined to release the tape			0
in the july 5 incident , six officers responded to reports that a man was trying to break into cars near a bus depot , according to police			1
the officers have been placed on involuntary paid administrative leave , and city officials have n't released their names			2
police chief @entity149 has also taken a paid medical leave , as two of the city 's five council members have called upon him to resign			1
@entity19 has said he will look at how @entity4 police officers wrote their reports only after watching the videotape			2
he said police departments have different policies on whether officers can look at their tapes before writing their reports			2
@entity19 said taxpayers could expect police " reform " out of his work			0
meanwhile , there are two external investigations into the death , by the @entity168 and the @entity35 district attorney 's office			2
the @entity168 is looking at civil rights violations			0
also , residents notified the city that they are going to start a recall petition drive for the other three members on the city council : mayor @entity177 , mayor pro tem @entity178 and councilman @entity179			0
the mayor and mayor pro tem positions are one - year terms rotated among the five council members , officials said			0
@entity1 's @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
