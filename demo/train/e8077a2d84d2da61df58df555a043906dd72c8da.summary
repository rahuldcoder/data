-- " there are those who keep out of mischief , and then there are the adventurers , " @entity0 , the pioneering legend of @entity2 racing , said in the 1990s			1
" we racing drivers are adventurers ; the more difficult something is , the greater the attraction that comes from it			0
" @entity14 is the greatest of the adventurers			2
" he 's not just been an adventurer			0
he is a man whose image transcends sport , much like @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			0
the @entity26 , who suffered a serious head injury in a skiing accident sunday , is a man for whom winning became an obsession			0
he racked up victories , wins and titles -- and then some : five consecutive world championship titles between 2001 - 2004 , 56 race victories in six years between 2000 - 2006 , a total of seven f1 crowns and 91 grand prix wins			1
after claiming his first two titles at @entity39 in 1994 and 1995 , @entity14 moved to @entity40 where he would go on to bring about a period of domination			1
his 72 race victories and five world titles with the " @entity40 " etched his name into @entity2 folklore and made him the most successful driver in the history of the sport			1
his search for perfection translated to recreational activities such as skiing			0
" @entity14 was n't a skier when he joined @entity40 , but by the end he was excellent , " @entity55 journalist @entity54 told @entity3			1
" each year @entity40 used to have a media week in the @entity59 in @entity60 and they would always have a race -- and it was always @entity14 who won			1
" few doubted @entity14 's natural talent , but his desire to win at all costs did n't always endear him to the watching world			2
@entity67 , the triple world champion who was killed at the 1994 @entity68 , remains revered to this very day , while 1950s hero @entity0 -- a five - time @entity2 champion -- was also hugely popular			1
" @entity14 " was loved in his native @entity69 and by the majority of @entity40 fans , but his appeal was not altogether universal , though his skiing accident has prompted a huge outpouring of support for him from around the world on social media websites			1
ruthless streak never far from controversy , @entity14 was often criticized for his arrogance and use of unsavory tactics to ensure victory			2
that ruthless streak was scarcely more evident than at the title - deciding @entity84 where , with his own car already irreparably damaged , @entity14 deliberately collided with title rival @entity87			1
the crash caused both men to retire from the race , handing the @entity69 the title			2
three years later , @entity14 attempted the same tactic again in the deciding race , this time against @entity95 ' @entity94 -- only to be disqualified from the championship , giving the @entity97 the title			1
then there were the groans of dismay at the @entity102 when @entity40 ordered teammate @entity103 to allow @entity14 to win the race			1
in 2006 , he was accused of cheating during qualifying for the @entity106 after deliberately stopping his car to prevent his nearest rival , @entity109 , from completing a lap which would have probably given the @entity112 pole position			0
born on january 3 , 1969 , near @entity113 , @entity14 attended the local go - kart track where his mother worked in the kitchens			2
by 1987 , he was already the @entity69 and @entity118 go - kart champion and left school to pursue work as an apprentice mechanic before becoming a professional racing driver			0
three years later he won the national @entity123 and joined @entity124 before making the move to @entity2 in 1991			1
he made his debut for @entity127 , qualifying seventh , and moved to @entity39 the following year where he began his ascent to the very top			1
a year later , he won the first of his 91 grand prix victories in @entity133			1
while his two title triumphs with @entity39 brought him to the attention of the wider world , it was at @entity40 where @entity14 went on to make his name			1
he joined in 1996 , when the @entity60 team was desperate to end a title drought which stretched back to 1979			0
it took four years for @entity14 to deliver what @entity40 so desperately craved , but when it came it began a period of dominance for the " @entity146			1
" from 2000 - 2004 , @entity14 swept all before him to win five consecutive world titles			1
in 2004 , he won a staggering 12 of the opening 13 races to help clinch his seventh and final title in what proved to be his last season of success			1
the following year he won just a single race after the introduction of new tire rules , and @entity109 ended @entity14 's title streak			1
@entity109 repeated the feat in 2006 , a year which concluded with @entity14 's retirement			2
" i retired simply because i do n't have the passion and the motivation anymore , " he said on leaving the sport			0
i did n't really think , ' i 'll take a break and then come back			0
' i was n't interested in it			0
i was old enough and i had achieved enough			0
" high - octane life @entity14 -- who has two children with his wife @entity171 , 14 - year - old @entity172 and 16 - year - old @entity173 -- was never going to take it easy in retirement			2
he took up motorcycling and skydiving to help quench his thirst for adrenalin while he also enjoyed horse riding as well as skiing			0
in 2009 , @entity14 was involved in a motorbike crash while testing his @entity184 1000 @entity183 at a racetrack in @entity186 , @entity187			2
he was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a mild concussion , while @entity14 also complained of pain in his right wrist			0
discharged from hospital after just five days , the incident did little to persuade him to give up such a high - octane life and instead he returned to @entity2 in 2010 at the age of 41 after signing a deal with @entity124			2
his three - year stint failed to match the glorious success he had enjoyed earlier in his career , with a third - place finish at the @entity201 at @entity202 the highlight			0
at 43 , he became the oldest driver to finish on the podium since @entity205 at the @entity206			0
finally , in 2012 following the news that @entity124 would replace @entity14 with @entity208 , he retired for the second time after a seventh - place finish at the @entity210 @entity68			0
" from now on life will offer me plenty of new possibilities , " he said after his decision to leave the sport			0
" i 'm looking forward to them			0
i prefer to be described as a fighter , someone who never backed down			0
