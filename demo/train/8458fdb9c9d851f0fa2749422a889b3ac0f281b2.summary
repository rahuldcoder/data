@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration on monday announced a 20 - year ban on new mining claims on more than 1 million acres of public land near the @entity7 , a move meant to protect the iconic landmark from new uranium mining			1
previously approved operations will be allowed to continue , as will new projects on valid existing claims			0
" people from all over the country and around the world come to visit the @entity7			0
numerous @entity19 tribes regard this magnificent icon as a sacred place and millions of people in the @entity23 depend on the river for drinking water , irrigation , industrial and environmental use , " said interior secretary @entity17			0
" we have been entrusted to care for and protect our precious environmental and cultural resources , and we have chosen a responsible path that makes sense for this and future generations , " he added			0
the administration said the move will give officials more time to monitor the impact of uranium mining on the vital watershed , and in the mineral - rich area in general			1
conservation groups cheered the decision , which was slammed by @entity46 gov. @entity45 and sen. @entity47			1
" this is a great day for @entity52 and all those who care about the park and the surrounding public lands and waters , " said @entity48 , @entity7 chapter director of the @entity50 , a @entity51 - based environmental organization			2
" today 's decision protects not only the area around the @entity7 , but water that helps feed the @entity23 , which provides drinking water for millions of people downstream			2
" @entity45 similarly stressed the significance of the park , but argued the move will needlessly cost @entity46 jobs and stall economic growth			1
" the 20 - year ban comes at the expense of hundreds of high - paying jobs and approximately $ 10 billion worth of activity for the @entity46 economy , " she said			1
" nobody wants to see it ( the @entity7 ) harmed			0
but i believe that environmental protection and economic growth are not mutually exclusive			1
we could and should have both			0
" the @entity52 is a major tourist attraction in @entity46 ; close to 5 million people visit it each year			2
@entity47 , speaking sunday before the ban 's official announcement , said he had expected the decision and was disappointed			2
