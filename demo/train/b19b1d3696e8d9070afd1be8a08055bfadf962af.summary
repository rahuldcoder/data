-- @entity3 's favorite @entity2 goes for a third gold in a row , women finally get to jump from the normal hill and @entity8 figure skaters take to the ice with the support and pressure of the home nation			1
men 's snowboard halfpipe @entity15			1
that 's the word snowboarder @entity17 used monday to describe to @entity18 the halfpipe that will be the site of @entity2 's attempt at a third straight gold medal			1
the preview from the @entity24 put it a little more mildly -- ok , a lot more mildly -- saying " several riders voiced concerns			0
" the report said the builders were making last - minute changes			2
that 's right , the day before the event the @entity24 field of play needs work			1
" it 's the @entity38			2
it should be flawless , " @entity17 , of the @entity3 , told @entity18			0
@entity40 sums up the media coverage of the storm a brewin ' at the halfpipe			2
on sunday night , @entity2 was asked by reporters what he thought of the course			0
he tried to be nice , but they could tell he was not pleased			0
still he tried to give it the best spin			0
" i 'm sure it will be ( ok )			0
i have faith , " he said			0
no matter how bad or how good it is , everyone will have to ride the same pipe			0
who to watch : @entity2 , trying to become the first @entity3 man to win an event in three straight @entity59			1
@entity17 and 2013 world champion @entity60			0
women 's ski jumping it seems weird but until this year , women have n't been able to slide down a really slick ramp , then hurtle themselves through the air			1
that used to be a men 's only club ( since 1924 )			2
it was n't because women are smarter than men ; it was because they were excluded for who knows what reason			1
@entity75 took part in the 2002 @entity77			0
she was one of the jumpers who tested the hills for the men 's events			2
female ski jumpers took the @entity84 to court before the @entity85 but came up with an empty victory			2
they still watched from the sidelines			0
but just a year later the @entity84 announced women 's ski jumping was in , so do n't blame @entity91 and the others if they are just a little bit excited tuesday			1
they 've come a long way			0
who to watch : @entity96 and @entity97 are the top two jumpers since the ski jumping tour began in 2011			1
at the 2013 world championships , @entity96 won gold and @entity97 was the silver medalist			0
but @entity96 was injured in august and only started jumping again in january			2
also keep an eye on 2011 world champion @entity104 of @entity105			0
figure skating pairs you want to talk about pressure			1
how much is there on @entity110 and @entity111 of @entity8 ? it used to be that a gold medal for @entity114 was a given in pairs skating			1
from 1964 to 2006 , no losses in the @entity38			0
tuesday is day 1 of 2 to make up for @entity121 , when the @entity8 did n't even make the podium			1
the pair had a chance to work any jitters out during the new team competition			0
they skated in the short program of the event , unlike four - time world champions @entity130 and @entity132 of @entity133 , who are second favorites			1
who else to watch : @entity136 and @entity137 of @entity8 , who won the free program during the team competition ; @entity140 and @entity141 of @entity142 , third at the worlds ; and @entity145 and @entity146 of @entity142			1
women 's singles luge @entity149 knows a little bit about upsetting @entity133			1
five years ago , she won the women 's singles luge at the world championships			1
that 's like someone beating the old @entity3 basketball team			2
it only happened about once a decade			0
and the @entity133 do n't just usually win at the big events ; they usually dominate the podium			1
@entity160 is third after the first day of competition -- behind , well , you already know			0
she faces two more runs tuesday to see if she can become the first @entity3 ever to medal in singles			2
who else to watch : world champion @entity168 and @entity121 winner @entity170 are 1 - 2 after the first two runs while @entity8 @entity172 is fourth and has home - track advantage on one of the longest courses in the world			1
women 's long - track speed skating you know you 're pretty good when one of your opponents says words to the effect of , " i really hope i can win the silver or bronze			1
" @entity187 won every 500 meter race she entered this season			1
that 's seven wins , four with world record times			2
@entity194 of the @entity195 said the only way @entity197 loses is if she makes a mistake			0
and that just is n't very likely			2
she 'll face @entity201 in the first heat , which may be a boost for the @entity3 skater			0
we 'd post some comment from @entity197 , but she does n't do media before her races			0
who else to watch : @entity209 of @entity8 , who won the one race @entity197 did n't enter			1
@entity211 of @entity212 and @entity213 of the @entity3 .			0

it appears that as of monday quite a few snowboarders did n't like the halfpipe
the first women 's ski jumping event takes place tuesday
@entity8 skaters have pressure to get back in the win *column* in the pairs event
winner of the women 's 500 - meter speed skating event looks like a sure thing
