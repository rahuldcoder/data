-- they call it the " coolness factor			2
" @entity0 commenters -- clearly energized about the promise of a new , privately developed space shuttle -- are buzzing about winged spacecraft versus capsule - based vehicles like @entity9 , which @entity10 used for its historic visit to the space station last month			1
a commenter called " gregory " points out the @entity15 space plane project in the @entity16			1
the theory behind space planes is they would be able to take off from a runway , rocket into low orbit , and then fly to a landing on a runway			1
@entity25 suggests that space planes are preferable because their engines would be designed to " breathe air like a jet at lower speeds " and then " switch to rocket mode in the high atmosphere			1
" @entity0 reported on @entity15 last year and one insider estimated development cost to be around $ 10 billion			2
@entity35 's program to fund private spacecraft development offers only a fraction of that amount -- less than $ 400 million awarded so far			0
@entity41 's @entity40 orbiter , which passed an aerodynamics flight test last month , would launch atop an @entity44 rocket and uses wings to fly back to a runway landing on earth			1
" as far as coolness factor -- @entity15 wins over @entity40 hands down , " gregory writes			2
well , yes , experts say privately developed space planes that take off and land independently from runways would be great			1
but they do n't right now			0
why not ? it costs a lot of money to develop new technology			0
for @entity15 , a crucial engine test still stands in the way of success , according to reports			2
then , down the road , suborbital test flights reportedly could happen as soon as 2016 , if all goes well			2
@entity67 's @entity66 is n't designed to take off from a runway independently , it has to be launched in flight from a mothership aircraft			0
it is not intended to achieve orbit			0
dream chaser -- which aims to reach the space station -- is expected to have its first autonomous flight test in august or september			1
it 's based on well - known design concepts , which saves money on development costs			0
coolness ? aerospace engineers will never choose style over substance			0
but the sweeping , sleek design of a winged spacecraft like the @entity40 does catch the fancy of a lot of aerospace aficionados who still hold a place in their hearts for @entity35 's retired shuttle program			0
let 's not forget capsules -- such as the @entity94 command module -- which traveled to the moon and back			0
yes , they were gumdrop - shaped with less " coolness factor , " but they got the job done			2
more reliable than wings , say supporters , because they 're simple and more proven			0
as one aerospace insider put it : sometimes the argument about winged versus capsules " can be almost a religious debate among engineers			1
" a downside of most capsules : they splashdown in the water , creating water damage , although @entity117 's @entity116 's system allows it to land safely on solid ground			1
as @entity0 commenter " @entity127 in @entity128 " points out , " @entity119 requires manpower and equipment to lift the capsule out of the ocean , which requires " lots of expensive logistics and infrastructure			1
landing on a runway costs a lot less , @entity127 suggests			0
right now , the @entity9 is designed to return to @entity132 by splashing down			0
but the company has plans to develop the @entity9 for on - target propulsive landing on solid ground			1
all this talk about wings versus capsules goes to a larger point : what 's the ultimate goal behind spacecraft like @entity40 , @entity9 and @entity145 's capsule , the @entity146 ? is it to build a vehicle that will take astronauts into low orbit ? or does the design goal take a longer view ? a longer view may be to develop a spacecraft that can travel to low orbit and travel to the moon -- or beyond			1
this is what @entity10 is looking to do -- develop spacecraft that can be used for different kinds of missions .			0

@entity0 commenter : space planes have higher " coolness " than shuttle
@entity169 space shuttle passes first aerodynamics flight test
@entity173 plans to add propulsive landing on solid ground
wings - versus - capsule engineer debate can be " almost religious "
