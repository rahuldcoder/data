@entity1 , @entity0 -- with every click of his camera , @entity7 photographer and activist @entity3 hopes to draw attention to the plight of @entity10 , a remote nation of people whose home is slowly disappearing			1
@entity10 is the world 's fourth smallest country behind @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity18 neighbor @entity16			1
he 's taking 10,000 photos , one of each person who lives there , to show the world the human face of climate change			1
" @entity10 do not ask much , neither goods nor money , " he says			1
" in @entity7 , people sacrifice their time and life to get more goods and money			1
i hope the viewers see the contrast by looking at the photos			2
we 're sacrificing peaceful @entity10			1
" at first glance , @entity10 is an island paradise , 26 square kilometers of white sand and lush foliage in the @entity18 , north of @entity41			1
but the sea level is rising , so much so that the nation 's water has become too salty to drink and to grow vegetables , especially taro , a vegetable that was once the island 's staple food			1
" as they do n't have water and food , they began to import food from overseas , says @entity3 , who set up the @entity54 to highlight their cause			0
" as they began to import , their consumption has been increasing			0
as a result , more and more products began to be imported			0
this changed @entity10 ' diet and increased the amount of waste			2
" a global appeal @entity10 's government considers the situation so urgent it has allocated some of the nation 's meager budget to pay for its own permanent ambassador to the @entity73 in @entity74			1
@entity75 took up the job in december 2006 and within months had given perhaps the most important speech ever made by a @entity10 : an address to a @entity79 of the @entity73 @entity80 on @entity81			1
" that was my very first statement that i issued and it was also a challenging one because it had never been done before , particularly at that level at the @entity80 , " @entity75 says			2
he told the assembled dignitaries : " the world has moved from a global threat once called the @entity88 , to what now should be considered the ' @entity90 '			0
our conflict is not with guns and missiles but with weapons from everyday lives -- chimney stacks and exhaust pipes			0
" click here for the full speech @entity74 is a long way from home for the native @entity10			2
back on the island he 'd be more likely to go for an early morning canoe ride than negotiate thousands of commuters on the subway			2
" living in @entity74 is totally different compared to where we come from			0
life is not that easy of course			0
you have so many strangers			0
at home , you know everybody [ and ] whatever you do everybody knows , " he laughs			0
securing a future while he 'd much rather be at home -- " definitely there 's nothing like home " -- @entity75 feels that his time in @entity74 is vital in helping to secure the future of the islands			0
" my ultimate objective is to contribute as much as i can in terms of trying to establish relations with as many member states in the @entity73 as possible , and more importantly to secure some sort of commitment from the international community in terms of development projects and any kind of assistance they can provide to us			2
" the @entity10 nation wants to invest in renewable energy projects , to reduce the island 's own reliance on fossil fuels for energy			1
" sometimes you have to clean your own house first before you look outside , " @entity75 says			0
in @entity145 , @entity10 means " eight standing together "			2
on the issue of climate change , @entity10 hopes the world will stand together with them			1
" to me it 's not an easy issue to solve , particularly in terms of trying to get the commitment of rich countries , " @entity75 says			0
" i can , of course , understand their reasoning and how they look at the issue but i think what we need to do is to continue raising our concerns and hopefully one day the community will listen and try to commit something			0
