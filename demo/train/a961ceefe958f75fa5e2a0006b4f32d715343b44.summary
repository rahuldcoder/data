the rationale behind @entity1 -- an international chain of academic centers run by an arm of the @entity6 government -- is understandable			1
with extraordinary economic growth in the past three decades , @entity6 is again center stage in the international community			2
in the early years of reform , it was imperative to bring the outside world -- particularly its technology and capital -- into @entity6			0
today , it 's imperative to introduce a born - again @entity6 to the outside world , especially in light of the myriad stereotypes , misperceptions , and distortions about @entity6 that are still prevalent among many foreigners			2
while introducing @entity6 language and culture to foreigners is a good idea , the aggressive attempt to do so via @entity1 has proved problematic			1
the @entity27 -- the @entity6 government body that operates the @entity1 -- often gives one the impression that it is carrying out a worldwide ideological campaign			1
several @entity32 educational institutions -- most recently the @entity31 and @entity33 -- reportedly have decided to cut ties with the @entity1 program over concerns about academic freedom			1
in another widely reported incident that adds to suspicions about their ideological agenda , the @entity27 ordered pages from a @entity43 scholarly foundation to be removed from a program handed out at the 20th conference of the @entity46 in @entity47 in july of this year			0
soft power push by the end of 2013 there were already 440 @entity1 and 646 smaller @entity51 across 120 countries			2
given that the first @entity1 was founded in 2004 in @entity53 , this is nothing short of a cultural " @entity55 " targeted at foreigners			1
@entity6 's leaders appear to have subscribed to the view that though @entity6 already possesses formidable hard power -- in economic and military terms -- it wo n't be viewed as a truly global power like the @entity32 until it also possesses equally formidable soft power			1
the elements of @entity6 soft power frequently cited by foreigners when asked about their views of @entity6 include the @entity67 , the @entity68 , pandas , @entity70 , and the @entity71			1
with the exception of pandas , however , they are all cultural products of ancient @entity6			1
what @entity6 really lacks is not culture per se , but modern culture that can easily resonate with people around the world instead of promoting the controversial @entity1 that are interpreted by some as a sign of cultural colonialism by a rising @entity6 , the @entity6 government would be better off attracting foreigners to @entity6 through scholarships , research grants , and cultural products			1
what would @entity88 say ? @entity90 was the ruling ideology of @entity6 for the better part of @entity6 history until 1911			0
it comprises a set of values , norms , and practices that derive primarily from the teachings of @entity88 , a philosopher - teacher who lived from 551 to 470 bc. while @entity90 has much to say about nearly every aspect of @entity6 society , it does not advocate aggressively spreading @entity6 culture outside the @entity104			0
instead , at least from my perspective , it exhorts @entity6 emperors to make @entity6 a " city on the hill " -- a shining example of advanced culture for other people to admire and emulate			0
besides , there is hardly anything in @entity90 that is both uniquely @entity6 and universally appealing			0
in fact , some of the core elements of @entity90 -- such as the priority of the state over the individual , hierarchical society , and deference to authority -- are obviously at odds with the dominant trends of the contemporary world			0
those who are familiar with @entity6 's post- 1949 history also wo n't miss the irony that the @entity131 government is marketing @entity88 as the icon of @entity6 culture			2
@entity88 and his thoughts were attacked as backward and as an obstacle to @entity6 's modernization during the @entity136 ( 1966 - 76 )			0
as a result , @entity90 was marginalized in @entity6 discourse , only to be revived and promoted by @entity6 leaders in the past decade			0
in the end , the key to @entity6 's soft power hinges on modernizing @entity6 culture instead of marketing its ancient heritage			2
such cultural modernization includes not only more appealing cultural products and business innovations , but also fundamental reforms in the @entity6 body politic			1
to paraphrase the wise words of @entity88 , perhaps @entity6 leaders should worry less about having little soft power abroad and more about building up a prosperous , free , and just society at home .			0

@entity6 is keen to *project* its culture as well as its economic and military power
@entity6 government *accused* of worldwide ideological campaign through @entity1
several @entity32 educational institutions cut ties over concerns about academic freedom
