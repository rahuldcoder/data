-- politicians , generals and clerics have all played their part in shaping the new @entity5 , with varying results			1
now the geeks are giving it a shot			0
in recent months , @entity11 residents from science , engineering and tech backgrounds have been meeting regularly to participate in @entity5 's first " hackerspace			1
" known as @entity17 , from the @entity19 word for " idea , " this open - access laboratory is intended as a technological playground to promote collaborative innovation , entrepreneurship -- and potentially solutions to some of the problems facing the country			1
" there 's nothing else like this here , " said @entity28 , a 16 - year - old high school student with an interest in smartphone technology , who has become heavily involved in the project			2
" it 's open for all people , no matter their ages and their religion			2
" sectarian tensions have been a hallmark of life in @entity5 following the ouster of former dictator @entity45			1
@entity46 form the largest group in the country , but for centuries were dominated by the @entity51 minority			0
today , @entity52 dominate the government , and @entity51 activists routinely protest what they consider discriminatory treatment			0
the hackerspace concept , where participants were free to drop in , experiment with specialist tech equipment and share ideas , has been imported to @entity5 via @entity62 , a 27 - year - old @entity5 - @entity63			1
@entity62 became involved in hackerspaces when he visited about 50 across the @entity63 in 2009 , shooting footage for a possible documentary			2
the model , he told @entity0 , had originated in @entity68 in the 1990s , but had taken off in the @entity63 in the wake of the global financial crisis , as skilled , newly unemployed people sought different ways to re-tool and channel their energies in a more entrepreneurial way			0
@entity62 says he saw parallels with the situation across the @entity77 where a young generation looking for greater control of their own destinies were being worn down by high unemployment and political instability			1
" how do you look into the future and see your ( hand ) in it ? " he added			0
" that 's what entrepreneurship is , putting control back into your hands and letting you create what you want to see and make a living doing it			2
" see more : ten of the @entity96 's coolest green buildings @entity62 started @entity97 during a flying visit to @entity5 in october , paid for through crowd - funding to his organization @entity100 ( the @entity101 and @entity102 )			1
having put the word out through online networks , he convened a series of workshops to demonstrate the new technologies people could play with in the setting -- such as a 3d printer -- and to introduce them to the ethos of the hackerspace itself			0
since then , the group , which meets in the offices of a local journalism institute , has been drawing as many as 30 active participants to its meetings , held weekly if security allows , said @entity97 member @entity119			0
although attacks by sectarian militants in @entity5 have decreased since the height of the insurgency in 2006 and 2007 , religious violence is still common and security remains a prime concern for civil society groups and other organizations pushing a progressive agenda			1
@entity131 , a 19 - year - old student with an interest in electronics and programming , said many locals struggled to wrap their heads around the concept , while @entity62 added that the project has been regarded with suspicion in some quarters			2
" first , they 're confused by the word hacker -- they think it 's something to do with piracy , " said @entity131			0
rather , the term here refers to an inventor or creator			0
the " open - source , " everyone - is - welcome philosophy that underpinned the project is also unique			1
" there are n't many communities in @entity11 that operate like this , " said @entity131 , who has been using his time in the lab to conduct experiments in home automation -- connecting items in the home to a network which can be operated through a mobile phone			1
" we do n't have a manager , board , administration			0
we 're all equal and every member can do whatever they want			0
" but despite its novelty , the facility is proving a major draw to a certain type of technologically curious , enterprising @entity5 , the majority of whom are college students or professors			1
" the most interesting thing is the people themselves , the people who want to help their community and others , " said @entity178 , a 21 - year - old student of materials science and engineering who uses the labs to further his interest in artificial intelligence			2

" the problem here in @entity5 is that people have lost hope in making things , " said @entity131			1
" people became unused to making things -- they just wanted to survive			0
if someone has a great idea they will get discouraged			0
but the new generation want to change , and they 're looking for other people like them who want to change			0
" to this end , @entity62 has had a similar hand in the establishment of hackerspaces in @entity218 and @entity219 -- operating on the basis that he helps seed the idea , then lets the community take over -- and has a vision for a chain of similar spaces throughout the region			1
" i want to see 1,000 hackerspaces from @entity227 to @entity228 , " he said			2
@entity62 added that you do n't need to spend long in @entity5 to be exposed to the challenges the country faces -- when he was in @entity11 , explosions occurred close to where he was staying -- and the @entity77 hackerspaces had some way to go before they began generating solutions to those problems			1
experiments thus far had been more modest in scope			0
projects in @entity219 include a high - tech reimagining of a " fanuz , " the colourful lamp traditionally lit during @entity245 -- a home - grown response to the loss of the fanuz - manufacturing industry to @entity250			1
@entity252 's hackerspace has conducted experiments with clay and cryptography , and while @entity11 's experimental makers are a long way from solving the city 's notorious traffic issues , @entity131 is proposing a simple intervention to make it more tolerable : starting a podcast to entertain gridlocked commuters			1
" we have n't gotten there yet , " said @entity131 , acknowledging that the sort of game - changing innovations promised by the hackerspace movement were probably some way off			2
but that 's okay , said @entity62			0
" i think it 's really important for the people in the @entity77 to feel like they have a place to come and play			1
people do n't really have that			0
" he acknowledges that his faith in the hackerspace concept has previously been described as " irrationally optimistic " -- but says that 's a good fit for the city			0
" i think that 's the only way to be when you 're working in a place like @entity11 , " he said			2
" i believe it 's this type of optimism that will allow me and others around me to look past the challenges that surround us , and begin to do something			0

hackerspaces have begun operating in @entity11 and elsewhere in the @entity77
hackerspaces are open - access laboratories intended to promote entrepreneurship
its members hope to generate tech solutions to some of the problems facing @entity5
