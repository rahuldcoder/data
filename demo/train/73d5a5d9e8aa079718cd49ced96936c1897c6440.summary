the thousands of immigrant children pouring across the nation 's southern border from @entity3 braved predators and harsh elements only to arrive in the @entity6 and walk right into one of the most toxic issues in @entity9			1
on the right are those who criticize the @entity13 approach to immigration			0
they say that by relaxing deportation policies toward immigrant children and their families , the @entity17 administration unwittingly created conditions for some 60,000 @entity3 kids to flock to the @entity6			1
on the left are those , including president @entity17 , who fault @entity25 , especially @entity26 , for rejecting a @entity28 - passed comprehensive immigration reform package last year and continue bickering over incremental measures			1
and in the middle are children , many of them fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
they are the latest pawns in the political fight over immigration reform			1
" the thing i learned from the border patrol this weekend from the men and women and their supervisors is that we can not enforce ourselves out of this crisis			0
they are being overwhelmed by the large numbers , " rep. @entity51 , a @entity53 @entity52 who hails from the district where most of the border crossings occur , told @entity56 in an interview on monday			0
influx of immigrant children expected to last through summer the debate over what the @entity13 calls " a humanitarian crisis " is pouring fuel on a raging fire , judging by the rhetoric			1
finger pointing republicans , such as @entity71 chairman @entity70 of @entity72 , place the blame squarely with @entity17 and his administration dealing with yet another crisis that has left it with a black eye			2
" the recent surge of children and teenagers from @entity3 showing up at our southern border is an administration - made disaster and now president @entity17 is calling in ( the @entity91 ) to mitigate the damage , " @entity70 said statement on the decision to create a group comprised of government agencies to address the issue			0
" @entity95 has gotten out around the world about president @entity17 's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the @entity6 illegally , many of whom are children from @entity3 , " @entity70 said			1
most of the children crossing the border would not qualify for " amnesty " under the federal program that defers deportation for children brought to the @entity6 previously by their parents or guardians illegally			1
still , there is some evidence to suggest the policy allowing thousands of immigrant children to remain in the country prompted others to strike out for the @entity6 , hoping they , too , could stay , immigration law and policy experts said			1
should @entity17 use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform ? " i think it would fall in the category of unintended consequences , " said @entity120 , an immigration law professor at @entity121			2
" i think the president was clear in 2012 of what his executive action did and did not do			0
he did not intend to signal that other children should come to the @entity6 but many times immigration law gets distorted and ( the kids may have made the journey ) based on those false of rumors that children will be allowed to stay here			1
" the @entity13 may have helped create this crisis , but the administration is not the first to find itself facing a humanitarian conundrum partly of its own making			0
when @entity139 was campaigning for president in the early 1990s , he criticized then - president @entity142 's decision to turn back waves of @entity145 immigrants in boats trying to escape political chaos in their country			0
this , in turn , prompted thousands of @entity145 to try and come to the @entity6 after @entity139 took office , prompting him to make clear that those trying to skirt the legal channels to citizenship would be turned back			2
a problem with many roots however , it is n't exactly fair to solely blame @entity17 and his administration for the flood of children now entering the country , many of them on their own , immigration law and policy experts say			1
according to analysis by the @entity164 , the " deep root causes for this child migration , and for the recent surge in arrivals " are myriad and complicated			0
" in reality , there is no single cause			0
instead , a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge , " the report found			0
" recent @entity6 policies toward unaccompanied children , faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in @entity3 countries , the desire for family reunification , and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged			1
" vice president @entity187 will travel to @entity37 later this week to discuss the matter with leaders from the three @entity3 countries at the center of the controversy			2
@entity51 and immigration law and policy experts all point to the need to improve assistance to those nations through stronger borders and less violence			2
there 's work to do on the home front as well			2
a @entity28 - approved immigration reform package , which included at least seven measures designed to address unaccompanied minors crossing the border , failed to make it out of the @entity209 - controlled @entity13 last year			2
those measures included ensuring high standards of mental and physical health care at the facilities where illegal immigrant children are detained , child welfare training for those who detain minors crossing the border illegally and legal representation for those children among other provisions			2
reports from communities where children are held indicate that kids as young as toddlers are kept in hot and crowded conditions			0
there have also been reports of abuse and a lack of access to adequate legal representation as federal and community assistance is stretched			0
@entity236 's journey : how thousands of children are creating a crisis in @entity3 the sweeping @entity28 immigration reform package also included a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country			1
this path to legalization would have helped ensure economic stability for those who left their children behind in their home countries which , in turn , might make the kids less likely to flee poverty in their homelands , immigration law and policy experts said			1
" it would not be as big a deal if we had a working immigration system			0
there are a lot of provisions in the @entity28 bill that would have addressed this issue of unaccompanied minors , " @entity120 said adding that for years the problem was like a " tidal wave " in the distance which neither the @entity13 nor @entity25 anticipated hitting with such force			0
" it 's another thing to see it crashing on your shore , " he said .			0

waves of immigrant children fleeing poverty , violence are at center of heated debate
while the right and left lay blame , both sides are at fault for the flood of immigrant kids , experts say
relaxing deportation policies , failing to pass immigration reform part of @entity6 role in problem
@entity6 officials will have to work with home countries to ensure a *resolution*
