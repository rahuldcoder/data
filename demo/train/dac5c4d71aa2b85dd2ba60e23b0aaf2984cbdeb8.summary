-- the @entity1 on tuesday will launch three days of hearings into the circumstances surrounding the @entity5 emergency landing on @entity7 's @entity6			1
in january , passengers of @entity5 had to be rescued out of the @entity6 after a bird strike			2
looking into several issues from the january 15 incident -- from migratory birds to why a rear door opened after the landing -- the @entity1 panel will hear testimony from key witnesses , including capt. @entity18 , the pilot ; and @entity20 , the only passenger scheduled to testify			1
on monday , the @entity1 corrected remarks made by board member @entity23 , who was quoted by @entity24 as saying @entity20 was being called to contradict statements made by flight attendant @entity5 , who has said a panicked passenger opened the rear door			1
the @entity1 said @entity23 , who will lead the three days of hearings , was mistaken and that @entity20 's written statement does not suggest @entity32 opened the rear door			2
@entity1 spokesman @entity34 said the board asked @entity20 to testify because he had the most detailed statement of those people in the cabin at the time of the crash			0
" safety board investigators interviewed 145 passengers , each of whom provided their own perspective on what happened , " the @entity1 said monday night			0
" some of the passenger reports conflicted with the accounts of other passengers , including accounts of how the rear door was opened			1
" " what was consistently reported by those inside the plane was that the water entered the aft section of the cabin immediately while everyone was still seated , " the statement said , adding that the @entity1 will focus on how the water gushing " affected the ability of the passengers and the crew to evacuate the aircraft since two of the four slide - rafts were in the rear of the plane , on each of the rear doors , and they could not be used			0
" @entity18 was the pilot in command during the flight , which lost power in both engines after hitting a flock of @entity77 geese			1
bird detection , and standards for engines to handle bird strikes , are among subjects to be covered in the hearing			0
other topics include pilot training for ditching and forced landings on water , and cabin - safety training , emergency procedures and equipment			0
