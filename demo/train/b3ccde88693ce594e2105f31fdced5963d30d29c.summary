@entity211 chairman @entity210 , @entity212 , urged a cooling off period before a final decision is rendered on the general			0
my " impression is that all of us would be best served by just backing off and staying cool and calm and not sort of succumbing to the normal @entity48 twitter about this for the next 24 hours			0
