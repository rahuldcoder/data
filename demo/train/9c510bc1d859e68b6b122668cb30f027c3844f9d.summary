@entity0 is already the " @entity2 " of @entity3 , but he has his sights set higher : he wants to be president			1
he 's a billionaire thanks to the candy company he started nearly 20 years ago , but , asked recently if it 's an advantage to be an oligarch when running for president , @entity0 sidestepped the question with a hint of a smile on his lips and a hint of steel in his eyes			1
" i do n't know , " he said in @entity17			2
" you should ask an oligarch about that			2
" @entity0 , 48 , is n't @entity3 's wealthiest man ; his $ 1.3 billion fortune makes him seventh , according to @entity24 's list of the world 's billionaires			1
but his wealth includes experience as well as money			1
he 's a former foreign minister and former chairman of @entity3 's national security and defense council , and now a member of parliament , focusing on @entity35 integration			1
given the opinion polls ahead of sunday 's election , political analyst @entity36 has no doubt that @entity0 will be elected president			1
he leads by a wide margin over his nearest rival , former prime minister @entity43 , in a field of more than 20 candidates			1
but if @entity0 does win , he 'll be inheriting a tough job			1
his country has been wracked by months of violence , with @entity49 laying claim to @entity51 and separatists declaring independence in several eastern regions of the country bordering @entity56			0
that 's the very reason @entity0 says it 's so important to have a presidential election now , when the country has an interim president following the flight to @entity56 of ousted president @entity63 earlier this year			1
" we need a legitimate , strong , powerful commander - in - chief of our armed forces			0
we need a legitimate president who can open dialogue , direct dialogue with all our partners , " @entity0 said ahead of a campaign rally in this city about a two - hour drive north of the capital @entity71 , in central @entity3			1
rally in the rain hundreds of people stood out in the rain in the city 's main square for a long speech by @entity0 during the event , which ended with candidate and crowd singing @entity3 's national anthem and a @entity87 pop song worthy of the kitschy @entity89 song contest			1
lights of yellow and blue , the colors of @entity3 's national flag , played over the crowd as they sang			2
when it was over , @entity0 worked the crowd , handing out autographed cards with his face on them , aides continually replenishing his supply			1
when the campaign rally was over , he spoke exclusively to @entity102			0
" my first step immediately after the election would be a visit , not to @entity106 , not to @entity49 and not even to @entity107			2
my first visit would be to @entity114 , " he said , referring to one of the main separatist regions in the east , an area now styling itself the independent @entity112			0
the purpose of the trip would not be to negotiate with the self - styled separatist leaders , he said , denying that they truly represented the people			0
" if it is a terrorist , they are not representing the people			0
they have just 500 people with guns , " he said , working a small wooden cross on rosary beads between his fingers throughout the interview			0
but , he said , he was more than willing to talk to anyone elected by the people , and he has no objection to more local self - control			0
people across @entity3 have " the right to speak any language they want			0
the right to elect the leaders they want			0
the right for the decentralization of power , " he said			0
he was firm on his two main goals			0
" @entity35 integration -- no compromise , " he declared			1
" @entity51 and eastern @entity3 , we are fighting for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country			0
" tough enough ? but challenged on whether he could work with @entity154 , he dodged the question , refusing even to mention @entity56 's president by name			2
instead , he talked about working with major @entity35 powers			1
and pressed again specifically on @entity56 and @entity154 , he fell back on the format of ongoing round table discussions with @entity3 , @entity56 , the @entity161 and the @entity162			0
@entity0 argues that his country has earned the right to join the @entity162			1
" @entity3 has already passed a very important exam in february , march , april of this year			0
more than 100 @entity3 gave their lives in fighting for democracy , " he said			0
while he said he personally would like @entity3 to join @entity168 , he recognizes that it 's not possible at the moment			2
" at present we have a war situation			0
@entity168 unfortunately will not accept @entity3 , " he said			0
the chocolate king has vowed to sell the candy business that made his fortune if he is elected president , but he wo n't give up his television channel			1
he gave two reasons for holding onto @entity179			0
" because this channel two times saved the country , and , reason number two , because the channel is not for sale , " he said			0
@entity186 ending it 's possible @entity0 will win outright in the first round by getting more than 50 % of the vote			1
if he fails to cross that hurdle , he 'll face the runner - up in a run - off election			2
some @entity3 are hoping the race will be over on sunday			2
one woman wrapped in the @entity3 flag at the @entity0 campaign rally said she was planning to vote for him because he 's the leading candidate and she wants the race settled as soon as possible			1
in fact , there is little difference in policy between @entity0 and @entity43 , allies a decade ago in the @entity203 who have since become rivals			1
@entity36 , the political analyst , said whoever wins the election will disappoint the @entity3 people			2
" the @entity3 people are looking at all these crises , dreaming that it 's a @entity186 movie and when the movie finishes we will see a happy ending , " he said			2
" now the @entity3 people are dreaming that the next day after presidential elections , war will stop and the currency rate will come back to normal and all the problems will be solved			0
" that 's not going to happen			2
" nobody could solve all the @entity3 problems soon and fast , but maybe when we compare mr. @entity0 to other politicians , he has the biggest chance to reunite the country , " @entity36 added			1
@entity0 himself does not lack confidence			1
at one point during his interview with @entity102 , he referred to @entity35 integration as a goal for " his first term			1
" and later he interrupted a question about what he would do if he wins with a correction : " when i win			0

@entity0 made his wealth in the candy business
he leads the field of 20 candidates in sunday 's election
the " @entity2 " wants closer ties with @entity35
