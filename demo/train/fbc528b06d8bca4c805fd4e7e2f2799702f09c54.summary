-- " i consider the people of @entity4 my patients , " acting @entity4 health commissioner @entity5 said this week as he cited health - related reasons for recommending @entity4 governor @entity8 ban hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " to develop natural gas resources in the state			1
@entity4 's environmental conservation commissioner joined in with the recommendation , which the governor quickly accepted			1
but if @entity4 's taxpayers are indeed @entity5 's patients , they should consider suing him for malpractice , because the new ban on hydraulic fracturing in @entity4 has nothing to do with public health or good science			1
instead , it 's an anti-scientific , political decision that will harm the country as it panders to far - left environmentalists			1
@entity4 has become the first state with commercial gas reserves to ban a practice that has revolutionized the @entity29 energy industry			1
fracking injects sand water and small amounts of chemicals into deep oil - and gas - containing formations , cracking the rocks and allowing the trapped gas and oil to be recovered			2
hydraulic fracturing has saved @entity29 billions of dollars , contributed to reduced @entity29 carbon dioxide emissions and greatly bolstered the @entity29 geopolitical position and @entity29 's energy security			1
frustration with this ill - considered ban is n't just partisan warfare			2
while my own politics are conservative , i am not reflexively hostile to alternative energy			2
indeed , i have worked with both @entity49 and @entity50 politicians and groups on energy and environmental issues			2
( i recently co-authored a report with former @entity50 @entity56 chairman @entity55 on smart ways to cost - effectively boost renewable energy , and have also worked on joint projects promoting sustained support for energy research and development with current energy secretary @entity63 when he was at @entity64 )			2
however , i am reflexively hostile to deception , especially when undertaken by people who cloak themselves in the mantle of science			0
and that 's exactly what is happening here			0
while science is always a subject of continuing inquiry , the strong consensus of research on hydraulic fracturing is that overall , it is good for the environment , the economy and our geopolitical position			0
the @entity29 has seen dramatic reductions in national carbon dioxide emissions largely as a result of hydraulic fracturing , which allowed natural gas to become cheap and abundant , and mostly displacing dirtier , higher - emission coal in the generation mix. @entity38 , and the similar techniques used for " tight oil " drilling , have actually allowed the @entity29 to become the world 's leading oil producer in 2014			1
the economics of the fracking revolution are also overwhelmingly positive			0
@entity95 , perhaps the most respected independent energy consultancy , says the industry will be able to support 3.3 million jobs , adding more than $ 125 billion to state coffers through state tax revenues by 2020			0
by 2025 , the average family could be saving $ 3,500 per year due to hydraulic fracturing , a staggering figure in a country with a median family income of just $ 52,000			0
and support for fracking is n't split down party lines -- @entity63 has called fracking safe and " a bridge to a low - carbon future , " a finding supported by several @entity112 investigations and former obama environmental protection administrator @entity113			0
not to be outdone , @entity115 's former energy secretary @entity114 has also declared that " this is something you can do in a safe way			2
" all of these leaders have been aggressive champions of renewable energy , and none could be accused of being a pawn of fossil fuel interests			0
by contrast , the integrity of some of the largest and most powerful fracking critics is severely compromised			1
popular anti-fracking movies @entity130 and @entity130 have perpetuated many dubious claims that have been widely debunked			0
@entity132 , the executive director of the @entity133 , hailed @entity4 's decision			1
yet between 2007 and 2010 , long after the hydraulic fracturing revolution was under way , the @entity133 was reported to have taken more than $ 25 million from natural gas drillers to fund its fight against coal power ( unsurprisingly , they pushed gas as a cleaner alternative )			0
of course , there are costs as well as benefits to fracking			0
and it is possible that at some point , new experience or information will come to light that would change our thinking			0
but we 've already fracked tens of thousands of @entity29 wells , and the endorsements mentioned above come in full light of that experience			2
increased natural gas production could have brought billions of dollars and thousands of jobs to @entity4 's hard - hit @entity159 , which sits over the @entity161 formation , one of @entity29 's richest potential sources of natural gas			1
@entity8 's ban will be particularly devastating for poor @entity166 , who can now be expected to struggle with high home heating bills due to expensive imported gas			0
unfortunately , as supporters of the ban have realized , @entity4 's move sends a signal to other states			1
but it also has geopolitical implications			0
the boom in hydraulic fracturing and tight oil production in the @entity29 has helped undermine @entity180 's international standing by contributing to plummeting global oil prices			1
@entity29 's ability to produce and potentially export more natural gas could similarly reduce @entity180 's ability to leverage natural gas exports to @entity186			1
so in the face of science , economics and geopolitics , why did @entity8 support the ban ? in his q&a with reporters after his announcement , the governor probably came pretty close to the truth on the politics behind the fracking decision when he said it was " probably the most emotionally charged issue i have ever experienced			1
" " i am not a scientist , " he said , using the same formulation as that of a number of @entity49 lawmakers who have been criticized for using it with climate change			0
well , the science and policy of a state ban on hydraulic fracturing is easy compared to the complexities of understanding the global climate system			0
and if @entity29 follows @entity4 's terrible example , the troubling consequences will be there for all to see -- experts and non-experts alike .			1

@entity4 's decision has nothing to do with health or science
fracking issue should not be seen in partisan terms , he says
the process has saved billions and bolstered @entity29 energy security
the integrity of fracking critics has been compromised
