-- if anything can make you long for the hang - loose 1970s , it 's the prospect of looking for love in an era when dating is governed by more regimented thinking than the old @entity8			1
first came " @entity9 , " which said that the best way for women to nab a mate was by refusing to give it up ( basically the code of the 1950s )			0
then came " @entity15 , " which said that if women are playing by " @entity9 , " then the only way for men to push past those defenses is to pretend to be even bigger cads than they are ( which , according to the theory , secretly flatters women by tapping their desire to tame the male animal )			0
then came @entity26 's " @entity27 , " which funneled " @entity9 " and " @entity15 " into one book by explaining to women all the ways that men are trying to outthink them			1
romantics of the world , do your heads hurt yet ? " @entity27 , " an amorous ensemble comedy based on @entity26 's 2009 best - seller , follows a dozen mostly @entity39 men and women as they attempt to navigate the brave new world of love by the book			1
the movie , which is very sitcom - setup - driven ( it 's " @entity46 " meets " @entity47 " ) , introduces its embattled pairings with titles like '' the non-committer vs. @entity51 '' and '' @entity52 vs. the woman who is her own man			2
'' for a while , the cookie - cutter behavioral tics are funny in an overly broad way , even if the dialogue is basically stand - up patter turned into glib , fast conversation			0
and the actors make good company			0
i especially liked @entity65 as the velvet - smooth player @entity66 ; @entity68 as the spiky @entity69 , who finds it hard to stick to her dating - war codes ; and @entity72 as the hilariously raging @entity73 , who ca n't stop jabbering about the divorce he only thinks he wants			1
yet " @entity27 " is so busy tracking courtship as if it were a science project that the bite - size love stories lack spontaneity			2
when the women first get hold of @entity26 's book , the manipulations that ensue are fun			1
when the men read the book and try to out - psych the women , the film should grow ever foxier in its complications -- but instead it comes down to a bunch of horndogs pretending to be chivalrous , which is repetitive and kind of soggy			1
that 's the downside of staging a romantic comedy by the rules			2
