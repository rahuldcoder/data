-- in late 2012 , some comic book fans were completely outraged			1
how could @entity2 lose @entity3 , its most famous character , to a brain switch with dr. @entity5 , so that " @entity5 " would take over the role of @entity3 ? that development in the final 700th issue of " @entity9 " sent shock waves across the comic book industry and gave rise to " @entity13 " with the new @entity3 , who was secretly " @entity5			1
" all of that finally comes to an end with the relaunch of " @entity9			0
" the first new issue ( # 1 of course ) hits stores on wednesday , and the anticipation is so strong that at least 600,000 books have already been preordered ( it does n't hurt that it comes with the comic " inhuman " # 1 for free )			2
@entity0 spoke again to once and future " @entity9 " writer @entity23 on the new developments surrounding the return of the original @entity3			1
@entity0 : so why lose @entity3 and then bring him back ? @entity23 : with " @entity13 , " we took @entity3 away from everybody for a year			1
and we showed you how having someone who should never be @entity3 be @entity3 , how much you 'd miss @entity3			1
and now he 's back ! just in time for the movie			2
it 's almost like we planned it			0
originally , when we were planning out @entity13 , editorial was like " this is a six - issue arc , " and we said " no , we can go longer than that			0
" then it was " ok a year , " and then we said , " you know if we go a little further , we can make it to the movie ! " it was a lot of faith from @entity2 editorial , and i 'm grateful they let me try it			0
@entity0 : why do you think @entity3 is so beloved and important ? @entity23 : @entity3 is the one and only @entity3			1
he 's beyond comic book superhero , he is folklore , he is myth , he is legend ! @entity3 is always gon na be there for us , for every generation , like @entity52 or @entity53 or @entity54			1
this is an enduring hero for all time , the greatest superhero there ever was			0
it 's weird because when we swapped brains with @entity5 , one of my editors said " you 'll know you did your job right , if when they switch him back , everyone goes ' no ! ' " it 's kind of fun that there are so many people out there who have become " @entity13 " fans that this has become a tragedy			1
no matter what you do , something 's gon na be a tragedy ! but there 's also people who are grateful and happy			0
they 're ecstatic @entity3 is back			1
@entity0 : what 's new about the new @entity3 and the new book ? @entity23 : he 's the underdog and when he gives his all , he comes through			1
and with @entity3 , he has all the problems we 've had			1
and for 50 years , he 's whined about it			2
now he 's the guy who has a new lease on life			0
this is his second chance , and he knows it			0
the mopey @entity3 , that 's what 's dead			1
this @entity3 will try to rise above it to grow up			2
this @entity3 is very much a @entity93			2
it 's very much the old @entity95 curse of " may you live in interesting times			0
" @entity3 is coming back to interesting times			2
@entity5 broke it off with @entity99			2
@entity99 is now dating this fireman			0
also , @entity5 was dating this scientist , @entity101			2
she moved in with him			0
and suddenly @entity3 wakes up to that ! what does he do ? we also learn that there was another person bitten by a spider at the same time as @entity3			2
we never knew this all this time , and now this mysterious person is gon na show up			0
[ @entity111 's note : we have now learned that this character goes by the name silk			0
] @entity0 : what do you say to fans who have seen it all in terms of superheroes dying and resurrecting ? @entity23 : let 's be fair			0
so you 've seen @entity3 's physical body up and running for a year and a half			1
and now he 's got his body back			0
i do n't think we 've seen a brain - swap in comics last this long ! this is n't death of @entity133 , @entity134 or @entity135 -- there 's been a really weird spin on this			1
you 've seen that body up and about the entire time			0
as far as the other @entity2 superheroes go , they do n't know he 's been dead or missing			0
they just think he 's been a colossal jerk			0
@entity5 's body was buried and in " @entity13 , " we learned that grave is empty ! ooooh ... @entity0 : what else can we look forward to in the new stories ? @entity23 : the whole world now looks at @entity3 differently , some good , some bad			1
same great power , all new responsibilities ! you 've always dealt with a mopey @entity3 but now that he 's coming back with this can - do attitude -- when life gives him lemons , he 's gon na make lemon - flavored web fluid			1
that 's our new positive , upbeat @entity3 .			1

@entity3 , out of *commission* more than a year , returns as @entity3
@entity3 's return is one of the most anticipated comic book events of recent years
his loss in late 2012 -- and replacement by @entity5 in a brain switch -- was *controversial*
