if you ever find yourself in @entity1 , @entity2 , rent a car and drive the @entity4 : 18 tunnels under the @entity7 mountains that culminate at the @entity8 , a gut - churning 1,150 - foot - high suspension bridge over the @entity10			1
it 's a man - made wonder , the world 's highest ( and maybe even scariest ) tunnel - to - tunnel bridge -- and yet it ranks only 15th among the world 's longest suspension bridges			1
for the thrill of seeing no. 1 , you 'd need to head to @entity18 , @entity19 , and marvel at the @entity20			1
but in the race to build the biggest and baddest bridges of them all , record - hungry @entity2 tends to dominate in hard stats ; five out of the top 10 suspension bridges are there , for instance			1
so instead of a @entity2 - heavy list of bridges , we 've focused on a variety of categories , from covered bridges to pontoon floaters , to bring you a diverse cross section of the longest			1
from the ice roads of @entity39 to a cable - stayed controversy on the other side of the @entity42 -- stretching over cities , seas and even the jungle canopy -- the world 's longest bridges exist on a scale that can only be described as stupefying			1
be sure to gas up before you take them on			0
@entity49 : see more of the world 's longest bridges longest suspension bridge span : @entity20 , @entity18 , @entity19 length : 6,532 ft. before this steel behemoth bridged the @entity56 that separates @entity18 from @entity57 , severe storms in the area would routinely sink ferries			1
not that the world 's longest suspension bridge has it any easier : every day , 23,000 cars pass over a structure that must withstand earthquakes ( a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit in 1995 ) , consistently strong tidal currents ( 9 knots ) , and wind gusts up to 179 mph			1
completed in 1998 , the record - setting central span 213 feet above the sea makes up over half its total 12,831 - foot length ; by comparison , the @entity71 's central span is only 4,200 feet			2
for an up - close - and - personal ( and gut - dropping ) view , bridge tours take visitors to the top of one of the towers			0
jb - @entity79 @entity81 's top 25 destinations longest inhabited bridge : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 length : 259 ft. like the @entity87 before it and @entity90 's @entity89 , the fairy tale - like @entity83 , or @entity92 , is a bit of @entity95 history preserved in the modern day			2
after a series of fires destroyed previous attempts to build a span over the @entity102 in the 12th and 13th centuries , a stone arch bridge was built in 1325			0
eventually , 62 half - timbered houses were added on top , 32 of which survived till today and continue to be home to shopkeepers and artisans			0
this multipurpose bridge has likely inspired more contemporary versions , like @entity113 's 919 - foot - long @entity112 in @entity114 , @entity115			2
erfurt - tourismus.de the world 's scariest bridges longest bridge over water ( continuous ) : @entity120 , @entity121 length : 23.87 miles due to recent feats of @entity2 engineering , the four - lane , 5,189 - pile concrete trestle bridge north of @entity124 got demoted by @entity127 for world 's longest bridge over water			1
but the change did not come without controversy , with many @entity134 loyalists arguing that the new winner , a 25.84 - mile elevated highway - bridge - tunnel project near @entity137 , @entity2 , actually has only 16.1 miles that span the sea compared to 23.79 miles of @entity134 's that are over open water			2
@entity127 compromised by bestowing a new title upon the 58 - year - old causeway : @entity144 ( @entity145 )			0
however you rank it , it 's still a pulse - quickening half - hour drive			0
thecauseway.us travel photos we wish we 'd taken longest canopy walkway : @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 length : 1,509 ft. deep in the heart of the @entity154 jungle , the @entity156 provides visitors with unparalleled views and no shortage of thrills			1
for a mere $ 1.50 , adventurers can channel their inner macaque ( and probably see one , too ) while traversing more than a quarter mile of narrow bridges strewn between centuries - old trees , offering up - close - and - vertigo - inducing views of local flora and fauna -- 160 feet above the jungle floor			0
taman - @entity174 longest floating bridge : @entity176 , @entity177 length : 7,580 ft. officially known as governor @entity178 ( the @entity179 statesman who oversaw its creation in the early 1960s ) , this section of @entity183 520 connects @entity177 to its eastern suburbs via a roadway that floats atop @entity179 on 33 football field - size pontoons			0
the design was chosen due to the lake 's unstable bed and the curved nature of the roadway ( a common problem for the area , which would explain why the state is home to four of the five largest floating bridges in the world )			2
the aging structure is currently being replaced by a larger , even longer , more modern floating bridge that can even accommodate a light - rail system			0
wsdot.wa.gov longest masonry arch bridge span : @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 length : 315 ft. though arch bridges are still popular today , they 're usually built with modern materials like steel ( see : @entity211 , @entity2 's @entity212 , at 5,712 feet the longest arch bridge span , period )			1
which is a shame , considering some masonry arch bridges ( brick and / or stone ) are so mathematically precise , not to mention beautiful , they could stand without mortar			0
more than 100 years old and spanning the @entity221 in southwestern @entity205 , the @entity220 is made of brick and unreinforced concrete -- technically very small stones and mortar			0
if it 's anything like its distant cousin the @entity229 aqueduct , it will stand for hundreds more			0
take note , @entity2 bridge barons			2
the world 's strangest bridges @entity144 covered bridge : the @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 length : 1,283 ft. @entity239 have nothing on this 112 - year - old @entity241 of @entity237 , which became the world 's longest covered bridge only after two spans were destroyed by river ice in 1920 , prompting replacement and a roof ( covering helps prevent rot on the central wooden trusses )			1
built as a private bridge by a coalition of residents desperately in need of a direct way across the @entity256 -- 3 cents for a pedestrian ; 6 cents for a horse and wagon -- it 's now a regional icon open to all , beloved enough to get its own @entity262			0
town.hartland.nb.ca longest rail bridge : @entity265 , @entity2 length : 102.4 miles connecting @entity268 to @entity269 along the @entity270 , this elevated viaduct was named the world 's longest bridge -- period -- by @entity127 when it opened in 2011			1
( also on the railway , the 70.6 - mile @entity273 , which connects @entity274 to @entity275 , is the world 's second longest			1
) running parallel to the @entity279 past lowland rice paddies , most of the span acts as an elevated railway , similar to the @entity282 in @entity283 , though a 5.6 - mile section does act like a traditional bridge , crossing the @entity287 in @entity288			0
longest ice bridge : @entity290 , @entity39 length : 68 miles @entity291 , fortitude and frigid cold are the only tools needed to build an ice bridge			2
made popular by the hit reality tv series @entity297 , many of these cold - temperature roadways traverse a snowy mix of land and frozen lakes			0
but this span over the @entity290 to @entity39 's northernmost oil fields is pure @entity39 ice			0
one of the most dangerous ( and unique ) bridges on this list , it is also one of the only ways to service the @entity312 hub of @entity313			0
the world 's most dangerous bridges longest natural bridge span : the @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity2 length : 400 ft. though bridges are one of the greatest examples of human engineering , they are hardly a creation unique to man : rock archways hewn by @entity327 ( usually by erosion ) likely provided inspiration for our brick - and - steel masterworks			1
and would n't you know it , even in this category of bridges , @entity2 still dominates			2
the country is home to three of the longest natural bridge spans in the world , including the 400 - foot stunner over the @entity341 near the border of @entity343			1
carved out of a limestone karst , the @entity317 ( @entity344 ) is an isolated structure accessible only by a three - hour rafting trip			0
