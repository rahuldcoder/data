@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 's parents head to @entity5 for closing arguments in their daughter 's murder trial they 'll be carrying a present they hope desperately she can use soon : a plane ticket home			1
in that purchase lies one family 's entire hope			1
@entity15 and @entity16 say their daughter is nothing like the person they 've seen depicted before and during her trial			1
they grimace at the description prosecutors have used in court : that @entity4 was a resentful @entity26 so angry with her @entity28 roommate @entity29 that she exacted revenge during a twisted sex misadventure at their home two years ago			1
prosecutors say @entity15 directed then - boyfriend @entity35 and another man infatuated with her , @entity29 , to hold @entity38 down as @entity15 played with a knife before slashing @entity38 's throat			1
" she is totally nonviolent , almost a passive person , " @entity16 told @entity2 in a joint interview with her former husband			0
so passive was @entity15 , the parents said , that she could n't even continue a kickboxing class because she felt it was too violent			1
she was so caring , they said , that she would make her friends stop a car to let a spider out rather than kill it			0
@entity15 was an easy child to raise in @entity0 , @entity1 , along with her younger sisters @entity51 and @entity53 , her parents said			1
she took to soccer early on but hit the books as hard as she played			0
it was on the field that she earned the nickname @entity4 , though they say it was rarely used and taken out of context when @entity38 was found killed to portray their daughter as a sex - hungry party animal			1
" it was totally associated to soccer and how she prepared herself as a defender , waiting to take on a striker going down , " @entity15 said			1
" so how people read this nickname is totally wrong			0
" eventually , though a star player at college , @entity15 gave up the sport to focus on her education			1
she knew she wanted to study in @entity5 and would n't be able to leave the team to go abroad			1
her mother said she threw herself into jobs to help the family save for the trip , working as a soccer coach , a barista and in a gallery			0
they recall a young woman far different from the wild party girl depicted by prosecutors , one they said found more enjoyment in going to a coffee house and reading a book than going out to a club			0
they say she met her former boyfriend and co-accused @entity35 at a classical concert			0
yes , they concede , @entity15 , now 22 , and @entity35 say they were smoking marijuana and having sex at his home the night @entity38 was killed , but that was as wild as it got			1
they reject the idea of revenge as a motive for @entity15 to kill @entity38			2
@entity16 said her daughter e-mailed and called to tell her about her new roommate regularly			2
@entity15 told her they got along great and spent time together , going to libraries and a chocolate festival			2
what has happened in @entity111 , @entity5 , is unfathomable to them			2
on november 2 , 2007 , at 4 a.m. in @entity0 , @entity16 was awakened by the phone			0
" @entity4 called [ and said ] ' i hate to wake you up , but something 's not right here , i think someone 's been in my house , ' " @entity16 recalled			1
the door to the home she shared with @entity38 had been ajar when she came home that morning , and when @entity15 got out of a quick shower , she noticed drops of blood			2
@entity38 's door was locked , and @entity15 could n't reach her , she told her mother , adding that @entity35 was calling the police			1
later , when officers broke down the door to @entity38 's room , @entity16 said her daughter struggled to understand what was going on , hanging on the few words of @entity5 she understood at the time			1
" they were screaming ' a foot , a foot , ' that 's what they could see , " @entity16 recalled @entity4 saying			1
when she learned @entity38 was dead in the room , a hysterical @entity15 called her mother , @entity16 remembered			2
" we were constantly on the phone , " she said			0
" she was tired , scared , there was a murderer out running around and she was afraid to be alone			0
" on the day @entity15 was arrested , @entity16 was flying to @entity5 to be with her daughter , to comfort her and help her find a new place to live since her home was still a crime scene			1
but @entity16 ' plane was diverted to @entity146 , where she switched on her phone and learned that @entity15 had been charged with murder			1
" i felt physically ill , i went to the bathroom to throw up			0
i was stuck [ in @entity146 ] for five hours , " @entity16 recalled , beginning to cry			0
by the time she reached @entity5 and was allowed to see her daughter , @entity16 had already heard news reports that @entity15 had confessed			1
she was flabbergasted and confused			0
see the evidence against @entity4 " it was horrible			2
we cried most of the time , " @entity16 recalled of the first meeting			0
" but we held each other and it all made sense			0
she told me what happened in the interrogation , how they asked her to imagine the possibilities			0
she talked about being hit , screamed at , threatened ; it was the most horrible thing she had ever been through in her entire life			0
" but even with the way @entity15 has been treated and portrayed , her parents know they are the lucky parents in this case			1
" as parents , the @entity38 family received the worst phone call they could get , " @entity15 said , adding he believes @entity38 has gotten lost in the sensational coverage			1
" at least our daughter called us			2
" after the arrest , @entity16 was sure there was a mix - up or problems with translation that would soon be cleared up			0
when @entity183 was later arrested in @entity184 , police said he had been speaking to a friend on a @entity187 call monitored by police and had been talking about being at @entity38 's house			0
@entity16 and @entity15 were sure again that everything would be fixed			2
during the conversation , despite saying that he knew who @entity4 was , he never indicated she was at the home the night of the murder			1
but after being jailed , his story changed , and he pointed the finger at @entity15 and her then - boyfriend , @entity35			2
her family said they 've tried to shield @entity15 from knowing how high - profile the case has gotten and how people are talking about her , discussing what she wears to court and what kind of person she is			2
but she does know she may be going to jail for a very long time			0
during closing arguments , prosecutors asked for her to be sentenced to life in prison , shocking her family who had expected a demand for 30 years			0
read about the case against @entity4 still , at occasional prison visits , @entity15 and @entity16 try to give @entity15 a light at the end of the tunnel			1
" we have to try and put on a face that it is going to work out , " @entity16 said , beginning to cry			0
" we keep telling her it 's taking way longer than expected but she will get out of there			0
they will not put an innocent 20 - year - old in jail , they just ca n't			0
" they take solace and hold onto the moments the court allows @entity15 to share with her parents after the trial has recessed each day			1
" they allowed us to go into the back room and say goodbye and hug her , tell her we love her , " @entity15 said choking up			2
" just those few seconds are worth a lot			0

parents of @entity4 say they still hope murder trial will acquit their daughter
they say they do n't recognize the vengeful killer portrayed by the prosecution in @entity5
@entity15 's parents say they know they *'re* luckier than parents of *victim* @entity29
