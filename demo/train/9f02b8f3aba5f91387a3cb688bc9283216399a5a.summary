-- @entity2 ceo @entity1 borrowed from dr. @entity4 's master plan for the technology behind his newly announced @entity7 e-reader : it uses frickin ' laser beams			1
introduced on wednesday , the @entity7 will be the first @entity2 e-reader with a touch screen			1
it costs $ 189 for a version with 3g cellular connectivity or $ 139 with @entity14 only			0
for a version with ads , those prices drop to $ 149 and $ 99 , respectively			0
@entity2 ceo @entity1 has defended the lack of a touch screen on previous @entity7 models , saying conventional touch displays produce reflections			1
a major selling point for the @entity7 is that it can be read in direct sunlight like a printed book , an argument @entity2 has used in @entity7 ads poking fun at tablets			2
" the current technology for touch screens -- it 's called capacitive touch -- is a layer that goes on top of that display			0
it adds glare , " @entity1 said in an interview last year on the " @entity40 " tv talk show			2
" we want a device that 's uncompromised for reading			0
" capacitive touch is what 's used in most smartphones and tablets , including virtually all @entity50 devices , the @entity51 , @entity52 and newer @entity53			0
it 's also the technology embedded in @entity2 's new $ 199 @entity55 , a multimedia tablet			1
applying a capacitive - touch layer to e-ink , the black - and - white display that looks like paper , darkens the screen , said @entity61 , an executive for @entity62 , the company that makes the popular screens in e-readers , in an interview on wednesday			0
for that reason , the @entity7 relies on infrared sensors , which are stationed along the edges around the screen to detect when the user 's finger touches a particular spot on the device 's face , an @entity2 spokeswoman said			1
tapping on most parts of the screen turns pages , rather than clicking a button like on the other kindles			0
@entity2 says the sensors allow for multitouch usage , meaning people can move multiple fingers at once to manipulate the screen , much like other touchscreen gadgets			2
despite its success with the market - leading @entity7 , @entity2 is n't the first to apply these invisible lasers , commonly used in tv remotes , to reading devices			2
@entity92 implemented the same technology to bring touch screen capability to its nook			1
@entity97 's recent e-readers , including a new model that will hit stores next month , also have infrared on their bezels			1
in an interview last month , @entity101 , a @entity97 vice-president , boasted about the company 's innovation in that area and said @entity92 had copied it			1
@entity2 's competitors appear committed to this touch screen technology , going so far as to shelve button - operated e-readers			1
@entity2 will continue to sell two versions of the @entity7 without touch screens			2
the base model , called simply @entity7 , ranges from $ 79 to $ 109 and has only a few buttons			0
another , @entity115 , costs $ 99 to $ 139 and looks just like its predecessor , the @entity7 3			0
touch features sap a device 's battery life , @entity61 said			0
@entity2 may have accounted for that by including a bigger battery on the @entity7 because that model lasts for two months , which is double the battery life of the smaller @entity7 , according to @entity2 's specification page			1
@entity1 is confident a market exists for both his touch screen and keyboard models			1
" we have many customers who tell us they do n't want touch , " @entity1 reportedly said at the news conference in @entity129 on wednesday			0
" we 're going to sell many millions of these			0

@entity2 's @entity7 uses infrared sensors to avoid screen glare
@entity1 had previously said no to touch screen kindles *due* to *limitations*
other e-readers from @entity97 and @entity92 already use infrared
