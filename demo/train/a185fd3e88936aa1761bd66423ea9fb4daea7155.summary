-- @entity2 leaders have rightly said that defeating the @entity3 in @entity4 and @entity5 and resolving @entity4 's deepening civil war will require urgent political change in @entity8			1
but the military assistance that @entity10 and @entity11 are speeding to @entity13 groups in @entity4 imperils that change			1
it now appears that a majority of @entity4 's political parties and @entity13 religious authorities blame prime minister @entity20 's authoritarian tendencies and exclusion of mainstream @entity23 groups for the crisis , and they seek his replacement as the starting point for resolving it			1
but just as this political majority has begun to form against him , @entity10 and @entity11 have extended @entity20 material and political support that insulates him from domestic political pressure and may even embolden him to try to stay on			1
@entity10 now is in a position to direct @entity13 militia mobilization and integration into @entity4 security operations and to shape @entity4 's military and intelligence operations through @entity10 's @entity40 advisers			0
meanwhile , @entity42 's decisive action to provide attack aircraft , trainers and advisers further bolsters the prime minister 's position			0
now , @entity20 can argue that he has international backing to rid his country of this " terrorist " threat by any means necessary			0
in fact , @entity20 still enjoys more domestic and international legitimacy than @entity5 's president , @entity54 , had when the @entity5 civil war began three years ago			0
@entity20 will surely amplify the significance of this weekend 's purported public appearance of the notorious leader of the @entity3 in @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity59 , in @entity60 to argue that the " @entity65 caliphate " is a clear and present danger that supersedes the need to form a unity government			2
he will probably argue that only he can attack the caliphate threat as commander in chief and that it has to be done now , not after a protracted government formation process			0
he will also probably urge @entity10 to quiet @entity13 opposition to his premiership so that he can perform the urgent work of commander in chief			0
already , the security and political situation is bleak , and unfortunately , the prime minister is in denial about his role in creating the @entity79 and fostering the rise of the @entity81 , previously known as the @entity3 in @entity4 and @entity82			0
after eight years in power , @entity20 has not shown that he can distinguish between actual threats and imagined ones			0
his often - irrational fear of a @entity88 return to power led him to employ an authoritarian sectarian agenda and to marginalize constructive but squabbling @entity23 political elites , all of which alienated the broader @entity23 community and set the stage for @entity96 gains			0
an unconstrained @entity20 seeks to crush @entity23 @entity98 communities , which is what he wanted to do in 2007 - 2008			0
during the " surge " period of 2007 - 08 , @entity20 repeatedly asked for @entity2 air power and artillery capabilities to pound @entity23 neighborhoods ( both of which he was denied ) while vehemently protesting the use of precision munitions in @entity13 militia - controlled areas			1
when the @entity111 received mortar fire from @entity23 neighborhoods , the @entity110 commander , gen. @entity109 , told coalition advisers that the prime minister wanted to teach the @entity23 neighborhoods not to let terrorists launch mortars and rockets from their streets			0
these brutal tendencies are sure to come into the open again now that @entity20 has the backing of @entity10 , @entity5 and @entity11 , all known for harsh tactics against civilian populations			1
if @entity20 can survive the next few weeks in power , he will probably feel free to take harsh measures against the @entity23 @entity98 community , as he believes that he is free of @entity2 constraints for the first time			1
given his inclinations and fears , @entity20 may think that he has great latitude to see most problems as nails to be dealt with by @entity13 hammers and that he only has to stop short of @entity54 's atrocities and abuses -- the use of chemical weapons or 200,000 casualties -- if the @entity5 experience is an indicator of what will be tolerated by the @entity2 and the international community			2
a defiant @entity20 -- with the support of @entity10 , @entity5 and @entity11 and absent @entity2 constraints -- will aggressively target @entity23 , who in his view are active supporters of @entity96			1
unfortunately , @entity20 's removal would not diminish the influence of @entity10 and @entity151 's @entity13 militias			1
@entity10 will continue to be the key determinant of @entity4 policy and politics for @entity4 's @entity13 parties and @entity13 militias regardless of the prime minister			2
@entity10 is skilled in power politics and in asserting @entity10 prerogatives			0
@entity10 strategic goals depend on an acquiescent and accommodating @entity4 government			1
if @entity10 were to pressure @entity20 to step down , he would surely be replaced by someone @entity10 could influence			2
one name that is on any short list to replace @entity20 is @entity166 , an @entity20 loyalist who as a member of his @entity169 party could be expected to continue the sectarian approach to security issues and the marginalization of his political rivals , @entity23 , @entity174 and @entity13 alike			0
regardless of who the next @entity13 prime minister will be , the sectarian actors responsible for executing @entity20 's heavy - handed tactics against the @entity23 population in 2006 - 09 are now back in key positions			1
we have seen a return of the " worst of the worst , " the very same actors the @entity2 urged @entity20 to remove and charge criminally before 2010			1
although many maligned sectarian actors were reassigned or promoted out of key positions in @entity8 to safe positions in southern @entity4 , it seems these sectarian enforcers have returned to the fight , with the @entity20 government 's blessing			1
meanwhile , @entity2 influence and leverage with @entity20 and other @entity13 leaders is waning , if not altogether gone			0
it began to wane in 2010 when the @entity2 ceded our leverage in favor of " smart power , " believing that reasonable @entity4 minds would prevail			0
the @entity2 treated @entity4 as a sovereign government and did not interfere with @entity20 's decisions to use the @entity203 ( @entity204 ) to marginalize and remove political rivals , to politicize the @entity206 by replacing effective commanders with @entity20 loyalists , and to renege on his promises to integrate the @entity211 movement -- the so - called @entity211 -- into the ministries and security forces			1
while the @entity2 watched , the @entity10 pressured @entity20 not to sign the @entity214 and backed his sectarian agenda of sidelining and arresting political rivals			2
@entity10 's strategic goals and dominant position , orchestrated by @entity40 commander @entity219 , will ensure that any @entity4 prime minister responds to @entity151 's core interests			2
@entity151 's steadfast support for @entity5 's @entity54 shows @entity20 the reliability and commitment of @entity10 to its clients			2
we should view @entity10 statements about an inclusive government with @entity23 and @entity174 politicians as mere window dressing			2
the reality is that @entity151 will not permit the steps necessary for fundamental constitutional reforms , power - sharing and checks on the prime minister 's control over the security forces and intelligence apparatus			0
@entity151 will see any such reforms as limits on @entity10 influence , something the @entity10 will not let happen .			1

writers : @entity10 , @entity11 aid to @entity4 imperils @entity2 call for @entity20 to make @entity4 government inclusive
thus @entity20 is less likely to leave or to stop *shunning* @entity23 , they say
they say @entity10 helps @entity20 return " worst of the worst " to key positions to oppress @entity23
writers : @entity151 will see reforms @entity2 wants as limits on @entity10 influence
