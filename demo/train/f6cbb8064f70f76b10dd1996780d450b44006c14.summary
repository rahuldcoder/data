when the @entity1 attends the @entity2 this thursday , it will not only be an implicit endorsement of the @entity6 leader 's stand against @entity7 in the name of religious freedom , but also an acknowledgment that @entity11 is firmly established as one strand among many in the tapestry of @entity16 spiritual diversity			1
yet it might also serve as a reminder that a religion now considered universally benign once endured suspicion , vocal protest and even government surveillance -- much as @entity22 has in recent years			2
already , 2015 has seen threats of violence canceling a call to prayer in @entity27 , @entity29 demonstrations in @entity30 and @entity32 gov. @entity31 comparing non-assimilating @entity33 to an " invasion			2
" all of this would have been familiar to some @entity11 not so long ago			2
today , @entity11 is the model of a minority religious tradition that exerts an influence far beyond what its numbers would suggest			2
while the @entity6 population of the @entity16 is not much larger than a million -- less than 1 % of the population -- the number of @entity16 inspired by the @entity43 is estimated to be more than 10 times that size			1
the cultural position of @entity11 73 years ago could not have been more different			0
when @entity47 signed @entity48 in february 1942 , authorizing the evacuation of all those of @entity52 descent from the @entity53 to war relocation centers , the @entity6 faith practiced by many @entity52 @entity16 was itself regarded as a potential threat			1
after the attack on @entity59 and the formal entry of the @entity16 into @entity61 , the @entity57 compiled a list of suspected collaborators that included not only members of groups with political ties to @entity68 , but the leaders of @entity6 temples			1
fbi director @entity72 's @entity71 used a classification system designating the supposed risk of individuals on an @entity77 scale , with an " a " assigned to those deserving greatest suspicion			0
in @entity72 's system , @entity6 priests were designated " @entity83 " : " dangerous enemy aliens " whose arrest was considered a matter of urgent concern			0
even before the war , @entity52 @entity11 were thought to be less " americanized " than their countrymen who had converted to @entity87 , and in some ways this was true			0
within the @entity52 immigrant community , @entity11 were more likely than @entity91 to maintain their native language , as well as their facility with customs and rituals performed in that language			0
they were also more likely than @entity52 @entity91 to read publications concerned with political affairs in the country they left behind			0
subscription rolls of such publications provided the @entity57 with a starting point for building its " a " list of suspects			0
because of the connections and traditional knowledge @entity6 temples helped maintain , to be a @entity52 @entity6 in @entity16 was to be considered a risk to national security			1
facing such scrutiny , many @entity11 enlisted for military service to prove their loyalty and patriotism			0
the famous 442nd @entity115 was not only entirely @entity52 , but it was largely @entity6			0
it became the most decorated infantry regiment in @entity119			0
in the @entity124 theater , 6,000 @entity16 servicemen of @entity52 descent -- again , many @entity11 among them -- worked as linguists and code breakers , hastening the end of the war			1
in the wake of these accomplishments , @entity52 @entity16 veterans petitioned the military throughout the late 1940s to add a @entity6 designation to dog tags and grave markers , which before had offered only markings signifying @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
their eventual victory opened up the @entity16 armed forces to recognition of all other faiths			1
coming during a time of increasing @entity29 rhetoric , and during the month in which the internment of @entity11 and other @entity52 @entity16 is commemorated , the @entity1 's presence at the @entity2 offers an opportunity for the politicians and faith leaders in attendance to reaffirm a basic truth too often forgotten in our history : in a nation that cherishes religious freedom and hopes to see it spread across the globe , targeting one spiritual tradition diminishes them all .			1

the @entity1 will attend the @entity2 on thursday with *president* @entity164
*buddhists* were viewed with suspicious by the @entity16 government during @entity61
