@entity0 -- despite @entity5 's shelling of @entity6 , @entity3 expert @entity2 says neither side wants an escalation of a conflict that has the potential to spill over into a regional war that would be extremely difficult to end			1
it is important to stress at the outset that we do not know if the shells that landed on @entity5 border towns , killing at least five people , were ordered by @entity19 's government ; all we know is the shelling came from the area where @entity6 positions had been firing at rebels			1
@entity6 has admitted its shelling killed @entity5 civilians , has apologized , and has promised that the incident will not be repeated , @entity5 's deputy prime minister says			1
@entity6 's information minister has pledged an investigation into how and why the shell came to be fired at @entity5			1
the big point is that the @entity19 regime is desperately trying to prevent outside military intervention in its war - torn country , and does not want to provide a pretext for @entity5 to do so , knowing that it would be disastrous			2
news : @entity5 strikes targets in retaliation for shelling deaths similarly , i believe the @entity5 government has no interest in military escalation against its neighbor			2
according to surveys , public opinion in @entity5 is strongly against all - out war with @entity6			1
equally important is the fact that , although @entity51 and the @entity52 have expressed solidarity with @entity5 , a @entity51 member , they are urging restraint			2
western powers , particularly the @entity52 , do not have the desire or political will to intervene militarily in @entity6			2
without the full backing of @entity51 and the @entity52 , @entity5 prime minister @entity59 would be reluctant to embark on any large - scale military venture against @entity6			1
so while we have seen a lot of escalation in the last 48 hours we need to put it into context : neither side has an interest in turning this low - intensity war into something more serious , a full - blown confrontation			2
what the incident tells us is that @entity6 has now descended into all - out war			1
it tells us that @entity6 's neighbors are deeply embroiled in its internal armed struggle			1
it also tells us that the civil war has become a proxy war between other regional players such as @entity80 and @entity81			1
the @entity6 conflict has also been internationalized along @entity84 lines , with the @entity52 and @entity85 backing rival camps			0
the spillover of the @entity6 war has reached not just @entity5 but also @entity89 , @entity90 , and @entity91 , with frequent armed clashes and casualties			1
if these skirmishes intensify and escalate , the potential of a region - wide war can not be overlooked			0
world : @entity6 refugees in @entity5 -- police are forcing us from homes this is why @entity105 powers , particularly the @entity52 , are reluctant to intervene militarily in the @entity6 civil war , lest they exacerbate an already dangerous situation : they want the civil war to remain an internal conflict where it can be contained			1
@entity112 's strategy has succeeded : he has forced the opposition to militarize the political uprising			0
@entity6 is in the grip of a bloody and costly armed struggle , a struggle that does not show signs of an early resolution , but of turning into a long , drawn - out conflict			0
no one knows how that would end , but it would ensure he has local and regional support to survive for quite a long time			0
the @entity6 authorities have little control over all military engagements			0
the fire has spread across the whole country : @entity19 's forces are over-extended and thinly spread			0
despite assurances given by the @entity6 government that the shelling that killed the @entity5 civilians wo n't be repeated , it is doubtful whether that pledge can be honored as @entity6 descends into all - out war			1
@entity5 has been extremely angry in the last few weeks			0
for the first time prime minister @entity59 has criticized the @entity105 powers for paying lip service to the opposition cause , implying that his patience is running thin			0
regardless of how the @entity5 leadership feels though , i do n't think it will act independently without a security umbrella commitment by @entity51 and a green light from the @entity52			0
they have made it very clear they will not act on their own against @entity6			0
@entity51 has gone out of its way to impress gently on the @entity5 leadership not to escalate the situation beyond what it has done so far			0
news : @entity5 vows ' no interest in war '			2

@entity6 shells hit towns across the border in @entity5 , killing at least five
@entity6 apologizes for incident , says it will not be repeated
@entity2 says neither side wants @entity6 's civil war to spread across region
