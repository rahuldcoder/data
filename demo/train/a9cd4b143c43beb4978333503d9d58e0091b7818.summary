@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 is cutting short an economic development trip through @entity5 to return home as officials in his state work to stop the spread of @entity10			1
he 'd originally been scheduled to return sunday , but @entity2 spokesman @entity11 told @entity1 the three - term @entity13 governor will now fly back on thursday			1
his decision to cut short an economic development - focused trip through @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 comes after president @entity21 called off plans for a fundraising trip to @entity24 and @entity25 on wednesday when a second @entity27 health care worker was diagnosed with @entity10			1
@entity2 had defended his decision to leave this week for @entity5 , saying in a statement wednesday that he 's been in close contact with state and federal officials about the @entity10 response			1
he said he had spoken with @entity35 chief of staff @entity36 and @entity38 secretary @entity37 " to ensure state and federal management of this issue is tightly coordinated			0
" he also said he speaks daily with dr. @entity42 , who heads an infectious disease task force that @entity2 formed earlier this month , and dr. @entity44 , the commissioner of the @entity45			2
those two are helming the state 's efforts			0
" this is the first time that our nation has had to deal with a threat such as this			0
everyone working on this challenge -- from the medical professionals at the bedside to the public health officials addressing containment of the infection -- is working to end the threat posed by this disease , " @entity2 said			2
" these individuals are keeping the health and safety of @entity66 and the needs of the patients as their most critical tasks , " he said			0
" every relevant agency at the local , state and national levels is working to support these individuals			0
" his trip -- just months from the end of @entity2 's 12 - year tenure in the governor 's office -- drew criticism from @entity3 @entity80 who called his absence while @entity27 health care workers are treated for @entity10 poor leadership			1
it also put @entity2 at risk of missing an opportunity to demonstrate his executive capabilities ahead of a widely - expected 2016 campaign for the @entity13 presidential nomination			0
" i have great faith that we will succeed in this important mission ; once we have put it behind us we will be the stronger for it and more prepared to meet the kinds of challenges that we as @entity97 are uniquely prepared to face , " @entity2 said .			2
