a smuggler 's drone flying from @entity5 crash - landed just south of the @entity7 border city of @entity8 , @entity9 , in a failed drug delivery this week , @entity0 said			1
the incident showed that smugglers are n't just going underground anymore -- using tunnels beneath the @entity7 - @entity5 border to transport drugs and migrants			1
now , the smugglers are trying to do business using unmanned aerial vehicles			2
@entity7 authorities acknowledge a new smuggling strategy may be emerging on the border			1
" to date , @entity24 has not intercepted any drones smuggling narcotics across the borders into the @entity7 , " said @entity22 , supervisory @entity22 agent in @entity23			1
" in collaboration with our federal , state , local and international law enforcement partners , @entity24 remains vigilant against emerging trends and ever - changing tactics employed by transnational criminal organizations behind illegal attempts to smuggle narcotics into the @entity7 " the drone was loaded with more than six pounds of the synthetic drug crystal meth , @entity37 police said			1
the drone crashed tuesday night in a supermarket parking lot in @entity37			1
apparently the smugglers became too greedy , @entity5 authorities said			2
the silver and black , six - propeller spreading wings @entity47 model was not able to withstand the weight of the load , police said			2
" in @entity23 , the street value , at last account , for a six - pound load would be about $ 48,000 , " @entity52 special agent @entity51 said			1
" once you get it across the border , that stuff 's like gold			0
" this was n't the first time a drone was used in a smuggling attempt from @entity5 , according to drug war analysts , @entity7 officials and local @entity5 police			1
but the incident amplified concerns about border security and officers ' safety			0
" i would hate to belittle 6 pounds of meth , " @entity51 said			1
" that 's like saying 6 pounds of heroin is n't bad ... but i think the big thing to look at is the fact that the cartels or drug traffickers from @entity5 are using drones in their playbook			2
" my greater fear , being an agent , is what a drone means to officer safety			0
that to me , personally , being a tactical officer , that 's my concern , " he said			0
drones are emerging as the latest technological gadget used by cartels and smugglers in trying to outfox border authorities			2
the crashed drone was a prototype that used a global positioning system , or gps , to send it to a particular destination , @entity37 police said on the department 's @entity104 page			1
" the cartels have been using drones for surveillance			0
transporting drugs is a bit more complicated , " said @entity108 , a leading drug war analyst			0
" this is further evidence that the cartels have unlimited funds and creativity			0
" as to why smugglers would attempt to transfer what in the grand scheme is " not that much , " both @entity108 and @entity51 were in agreement			0
" my guess ... it might be a personal load , " @entity108 said			0
" when you look at cartels , their goal is to flood the @entity7 with as much drugs as they possibly can , " @entity51 said			2
" it also could have been a test run for something bigger			0
" @entity1 's @entity129 contributed to this report			0
