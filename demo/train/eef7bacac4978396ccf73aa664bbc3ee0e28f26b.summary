@entity0 -- for six mornings each week @entity0 's @entity3 fish market is one of the busiest places in an already hyperactive city			1
fishing boats unload their catch : still thrashing live fish caught in the @entity10 and more tropical waters further afield			0
from the murky holding tanks they 're soon dispatched in lorries to feed the city 's hearty appetite for live seafood			1
around 30 tons each day are landed at the @entity3 market alone , according to the @entity0 's @entity19 , with six other live fish markets dotted across the territory			1
but while the market continues to do brisk business , the livelihood of the city 's fishermen has been in slow decline for years			0
" it 's quite hard to do business now because there is not much supply , " says fisherman mr @entity27 , proudly holding up his prize catch , a grouper large enough to make a dining table groan			2
" we now do one trip only , with little supply we can not even out the cost			0
there is not much fish in the sea			0
" the specimen he was showing off came from thousands of miles away			0
that alone tells the story			0
@entity0 's territorial waters have severely depleted since the 1980s , according to the environmental group @entity46			1
although being close to fished out for years , it was only in january of this year that a five - year ban on trawling in @entity0 waters came into effect			1
championed by environmental groups , it 's proved controversial among some of the trawler owners and the fishermen and families that rely on the fishing fleet			0
the trawlers can still fish outside the banned area , but many of the vessels with their characteristic high bows remain idle in port with their nets folded ; their owners and crew relying on a slice of a $ 200 million government compensation fund			2
even if fishing stocks do recover , many are doubtful the traditional way of life -- a part of @entity0 's culture for as long as the city has existed -- will ever really return			1
preserving heritage @entity78 was a lifelong fisherman who saw out many stormy periods in the industry until 2004 , when he swapped the high seas to join the @entity82 , located a few kilometers from @entity0 's main island			1
in place of nets and rigging , he now has buckets of fish feed at the fish farm and education center			1
" from what i remember , in the 1950s and 1960s , the fishermen population in @entity0 was close to 100,000			2
now i believe it 's less than 10,000 , " he says			0
citing numerous reasons for the decline -- from fuel prices to declining stocks and the unstable income from fishing -- @entity78 fears the recent ban could prove a final nail in the coffin of the local industry , one he wishes will be preserved as much as possible			2
" i hope that people who have the passion can continue to work in the fishing industry			0
@entity0 was a small fishing port and has now developed and become an international financial center			2
not a lot of people know about @entity0 's fishing history and culture , so i think this project is worth trying			1
" farming for the future appetites wo n't abate for seafood and fish farming seems to be the answer			2
around 70 % -80 % of fish sold at @entity3 fish market already comes from fish farms and aquaculture facilities , mostly around mainland @entity124			1
making aquaculture environmentally sound is another issue ; much of the feed for fish farms comes from live caught " trash fish " -- the price of which has increased in @entity0 since the trawling ban			1
high - tech schemes , like @entity134 indoor fish farm technology , housed on the 15th floor of a skyscraper 30 miles from the sea , offer some ingenious solutions to aquaculture 's problems of sustainability and quality			1
using vast tanks to grow out valuable fish for the restaurant trade , the company has developed a method where the water is recycled and fish feed comes from sustainable sources , not trash fish			0
the demand for its fish , like live coral grouper , is in good health says @entity156 , managing director of @entity134 , but making it as affordable or cheaper than other products will be key to its success			0
" in the long term the fishermen of @entity0 do n't have much of a future , " @entity156 says			0
" there 's a lot of lip service from wholesalers about a sustainable product , but really it comes down to the price mechanism			0

@entity0 ban on trawling puts *emphasis* on aquaculture to meet growing demand for seafood
fish farms provide around 70 % of fish to local wholesale markets
many fear the traditional fisherman 's life will soon be a thing of the past
high - tech indoor fish farm in @entity0 provides new method of aquaculture
