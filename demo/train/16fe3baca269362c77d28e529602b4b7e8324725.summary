@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 , who is expected to be named president in march and likely next premier @entity5 will inherit a foreign policy that puts a premium on partnerships that can help @entity3 fuel its resource - hungry economy			1
in the world of geo - politics , symbolism goes a long way in forging lasting , strategic relations			0
this is certainly the case when it comes to @entity3 's role within the @entity18 , specifically with @entity19 , the country with the world 's largest proven oil reserves			1
when @entity22 took over the throne in @entity19 , his first foreign visit in january 2006 was to @entity25 after an invitation of president @entity27			0
six years later , the countries ' two state - run energy giants , @entity3 's @entity28 and @entity30 , inked a huge oil agreement guaranteeing the @entity33 nation an additional 400,000 barrels a day from a @entity35 refinery in the @entity19 city of @entity37			1
this is on top of the estimated one million barrels of oil a day it now orders from the @entity43			0
" we need @entity3 as much as @entity3 needs us , " said @entity44 in a @entity1 interview right after he signed the agreement , " but the energy corridor is only part of it			0
we envisage an exchange of goods and services and trade in other areas that add value to the @entity3 economy and to the @entity19 economy as well			1
" that deal follows a major equity investment in the @entity61 province where @entity30 invested in petrochemical manufacturing facilities along with @entity64 energy giant @entity63			0
in the 19th century the battle over influence of @entity67 was described as the " @entity68 " as the @entity70 and @entity71 empires vied for control and influence in the region			2
in the 21st century , one may view @entity3 's influence in the @entity18 in a similar vein			1
" clearly there are mutual interests in terms of large energy suppliers and consumers , but there will be stress points , of course , " said @entity77 , co-founder of @entity78 , an investment advisory firm specializing on trade between the @entity18 and @entity80			0
@entity3 , experts say , is keen to lock in strategic commodity supplies rather than exercise political influence at this juncture			1
this is reflected in its vetoes -- together with @entity71 -- striking down resolutions against @entity96 on the @entity98 @entity97			0
this strategy of non-intervention may not be sustainable , says @entity77 , " i think @entity3 's position will be challenged by the @entity103 countries and that is certainly a risk the new leadership has to look out for " especially since @entity25 is so dependent on the region to fuel its economic expansion			1
but one can not doubt whether the world 's second largest economy is instrumental in rebuilding the ancient @entity111			0
@entity3 continues to go to great lengths to foster developing market trade partners -- some argue to exploit their natural resources in the case of @entity117 -- as part of its " @entity68 " strategy			1
@entity3 rolls out the welcome mat on its soil , for example recently inviting @entity124 leaders to @entity125 , in northern - central part of the country , for the 3rd @entity3 - @entity128			2
there are some lofty expectations for trade between @entity3 and the @entity124 states			0
the @entity134 ' foreign trade minister , @entity133 , said bilateral trade between the @entity103 and @entity3 could hit $ 300 billion by 2014			2
trade between @entity3 and the @entity134 grew 10 % last year alone , witnessing a fivefold increase in less than a decade			0
some see @entity140 's @entity139 as an excellent gateway for @entity3 into the @entity143 continent			2
this keen business interest in the @entity18 is not likely to change with @entity2 taking over the helm in 2013 , but is @entity3 ready for a g - 2 world dominated by @entity147 and @entity25 ? not yet , strategists suggest			1
@entity25 prefers the relative comfort of the broader @entity151 world that brings the developed and developing world under one umbrella , with the ability for the new leaders of @entity3 to seek political alignment from @entity158 partners @entity159 , @entity71 , @entity160 and @entity117			2
all the while , @entity3 continues to blaze new trails beyond the @entity18 in search of strategic supplies			1
this autumn , the country made inroads into @entity167 with the first high level visit in more than a half century			0
the bounty is a promising one with more than a trillion dollars of mineral deposits estimated in the country			0
@entity3 's " @entity68 " continues with an ever expanding footprint from the @entity18 well into @entity173 .			1

@entity3 's foreign policy values relationships to fuel its resource - hungry economy
oil drives strategic relationship between @entity18 and @entity3
@entity3 's " @entity68 " seeks supplies rather than political influence
