-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 , a former top aide to president @entity3 , ended his very public flirtation with running for president early sunday with an e-mail to supporters that narrowed the field of plausible 2012 @entity11 challengers to president @entity12			1
" the counsel and encouragement i received from important citizens like you caused me to think very deeply about becoming a national candidate , " @entity1 said in the message distributed through the @entity14			1
" in the end , i was able to resolve every competing consideration but one , but that , the interests and wishes of my family , is the most important consideration of all			0
" with top @entity11 anxious about what many view as the underwhelming state of the @entity11 field , @entity1 was pressed to enter the race by close advisers and former @entity3 administration officials who worked with him when he served as @entity36 budget director from 2001 to 2003			1
former @entity38 gov. @entity37 , who is expected to announce monday in @entity39 that he will seek the @entity11 nomination , issued a statement sunday praising @entity1			1
" @entity1 is a friend of mine and one of the best governors in the country , " @entity37 said			1
" while he may not be running , he is an intellectual powerhouse and will continue to play a leading role in the party 's politics and the nation 's policies			0
" @entity37 also said he and @entity61 " agree that @entity53 's out - of - control national debt is a threat to our nation 's future , and that the next president must restore fiscal responsibility in @entity60 , @entity60 " former @entity63 gov. @entity62 , a top contender in 2008 , is also expected to run			1
former house speaker @entity64 has declared his candidacy			0
" @entity1 is a great governor and a remarkable innovator , " @entity66 said in a statement sunday			1
" @entity1 has brought successful reforms to @entity2 that should be replicated across the country and in @entity60			1
he will continue to be an important leader in solving @entity53 's problems			0
" radio host @entity73 has declared candidacy as well			0
@entity76 , who recently stepped down as @entity53 ambassador to @entity78 and is mulling a @entity36 run himself , said " @entity1 will be missed in this presidential debate , but his message about the most immediate threat facing our nation -- the massive debt -- will not go unheard			1
" in his statement , @entity76 said he has " learned a lot from ( @entity1 ' ) leadership " and looks " forward to working with him to promote long - term solutions " to problems facing the @entity53			1
@entity92 gov. @entity91 , a @entity14 powerhouse , said last month that he would not run , and encouraged @entity61 to go for it			2
@entity2 @entity95 used @entity1 ' announcement to knock the @entity11 contenders			1
" we 've disagreed with @entity1 myriad times , but there 's no doubt that his decision not to enter this race is a loss for @entity11 , " the @entity98 said in a statement sunday			2
" @entity1 would have brought a serious tone to a @entity14 field that 's thus far been characterized by silliness and distraction			1
" the killing of @entity111 by @entity112 in @entity113 gave president @entity12 's popularity a big boost			0
but @entity53 's economic recovery remains sluggish			0
if it stays weak , some believe , @entity12 is beatable next year			0
in considering a presidential bid , @entity1 had publicly fretted about his family 's well - being			2
his dramatic marriage -- he and his wife @entity124 divorced , then re-married in the 1990s -- had recently spilled into public view			0
the famously private @entity61 spoke at a spring fundraiser for the @entity14 this month , an event political observers watched closely to see whether the @entity1 family was prepared to leap into the presidential fray			1
even after the speech , the @entity2 first lady said she was " nervous " about her personal life becoming public fodder			2
@entity1 , too , seemed reluctant to join the race and openly questioned whether he had the desire to survive the long and exhausting marathon of running for president -- indecision that led some observers to dub him " @entity142			2
" " maybe i could do that , maybe someone else could do it better , " @entity1 said recently when asked whether he wanted to run			2
it seemed throughout the decision - making process that his advisers and supporters wanted him to run more than he did			0
" if i have disappointed you , i will always be sorry , " @entity1 wrote in the late night e-mail			2
" if you feel that this was a non-courageous or unpatriotic decision , i understand and will not attempt to persuade you otherwise			0
i only hope that you will accept my sincerity in the judgment i reached			0
" @entity1 , who became @entity2 governor in 2005 , would have presented himself as the most fiscally conservative choice among the @entity11 presidential candidates			1
he flipped a state budget deficit into a surplus , reduced tax rates and passed a sweeping education reform package in the most recent legislative session			0
the announcement that @entity1 will not run in 2012 comes a week after former @entity165 gov. @entity164 announced he would not seek the nomination			2
@entity164 won the first - in - the - nation @entity39 caucuses in 2008 and was considered a top contender this time around			0
