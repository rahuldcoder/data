-- the @entity2 is unable to account for most of $ 1.2 billion in funding that it gave to @entity6 to train @entity8 police , a government report said tuesday			1
an international police liaison officer hired by @entity6 stands near new @entity8 police recruits in @entity11 , @entity8			1
" the bottom line is that @entity18 ca n't account for where it went , " said @entity12 , who was involved in putting together the 20 - page report for the special inspector general for @entity8 reconstruction ( @entity16 )			1
the @entity2 's @entity25 ( @entity26 ) " did not have the information needed to identify what @entity6 provided under the contract or how funds were spent , " the report said			1
as a result , the audit agency announced it has suspended its oversight of the agency 's project until @entity26 gathers the information			1
" their records are just not detailed , " @entity12 said monday in a telephone interview			2
" from an audit perspective , we 've identified the problem ; they 're working to rectify the problem			1
" though @entity8 police have indeed been trained and equipment has been provided under the contract , invoices and supporting paperwork submitted by @entity6 " were in disarray , " the report said			1
in addition , @entity26 " had not validated the accuracy " of invoices received prior to last october , and " @entity26 does not know specifically what it received for most of the $ 1.2 billion in expenditures under its @entity6 contract for the @entity54			1
" the lack of controls " created an environment vulnerable to waste and fraud , " the report said			1
@entity12 , an accountant by training who spent two years in @entity8 , added , " it 's like so much else that happened in @entity64 ... there was just a massive quantity of work and too few people in place to do it			1
they just essentially did not have the staff to monitor what was going on			2
" bills came in ; they paid the bills , but they do n't know what they paid for and they do n't know what they 've gotten			0
" @entity12 , who has carried out audits for the @entity78 for three decades , said the projected time line of three to five years to rectify the problem " is not atypical " for @entity82 projects carried out in @entity8 since the ouster of president @entity84			1
" @entity64 is its own arena , " he said			0
" contract control has been a major shortcoming across the board			0
" in addition to having too few properly trained people , problems arose from the difficulties inherent in traveling within @entity8 and from " the rush to get reconstruction activities under way before we actually had a full structure in place to manage them , " he said			1
asked whether the full structure is currently in place more than four years after the @entity82 - led invasion , he said			2
" it continues to be a problem			0
" in a letter to @entity16 , @entity26 acting assistant secretary @entity105 said her agency has made " significant progress in correcting past contract management problems " and " is dedicated to addressing our past contracting problems and systematically strengthening contract management and oversight			0
" she said invoice processing delays will be reduced as staffing is beefed up in @entity64			0
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity115 said a number of reforms have been made since january			0
" we are committed to continuous improvement , " she said			0
the @entity121 - based staff of four will soon be increased to 11 , and the @entity64 - based staff of five will be augmented to seven " as soon as they all have their clearances , " she said			2
still , she acknowledged , it will take years to get the paperwork current			0
" it is n't an easy process , " she said			0
" there is a huge need , a huge , urgent need and there were not enough people to be able to fill that void , " she said			0
" that is something that we are in the process of doing			0
" @entity140 , a spokesman for @entity6 , said the company 's work in @entity8 is a " really complex program			1
... we buy weapons , body armor , vehicles , communications equipment -- that all belongs to the @entity2			0
" sometimes , he said , " it 's coded wrong or double - billed			2
we actually find a lot of that ourselves in the normal auditing process			0
" tuesday 's report is the second in a series of financial reviews ordered by @entity156 and carried out by @entity16 looking into large @entity158 and @entity159 projects			1
the first report , issued three months ago , criticized officials with the @entity162 for lack of oversight of their contract with @entity167			2
@entity167 is a privately held , @entity82 conglomerate of engineering , construction , and project management companies			0
the series of at least 10 reports will be finalized by spring , he said			2
