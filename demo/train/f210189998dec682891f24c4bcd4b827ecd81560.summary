-- anyone who 's ever read a nutrition label knows that our food supply is full of hard - to - pronounce chemicals			2
most are generally recognized as safe , as the @entity6 likes to say , but a few have given scientists cause for concern			1
@entity12 announced last week that it would be removing the controversial chemical from its bread			1
generally used for strengthening dough , azodicarbonamide is also found in yoga mats and shoe soles , according to the @entity19 in the @entity20			2
one of the breakdown products is a recognized carcinogen			2
though @entity12 is going to remove azodicarbonamide , there 's a long list of other chemicals used in its bread : calcium carbonate , calcium sulfate , ammonium sulfate , @entity30 , sodium stearoyl lactylate , potassium iodate and ascorbic acid , according to the restaurant 's website ( @entity36 )			1
and @entity12 certainly is n't alone			1
what other chemical additives are commonly found in your food ? here are seven , picked at random as good practice for the upcoming @entity41 ( just kidding )			2
tartrazine and other food dyes when @entity45 announced last year that it would be removing @entity46 ( tartrazine ) and no. 6 from certain varieties of its @entity49 products , advocates rejoiced			1
@entity50 1 , @entity51 3 , @entity52 and others have been loosely linked to everything from hyperactivity in children to cancer in lab animals			2
generally found in candy , beverages and baked goods , color additives are also used in cosmetics			1
but you knew that , right ? did you also know about the ground - up insects in your drinks ? cochineal extract is an approved artificial dye derived from a small bug that lives on cactus plants in @entity72 and @entity73			2
as long as you 're not allergic , you 're safe to drink up , according to the @entity19 in the @entity20			0
@entity74 ( @entity74 ) well , that 's a mouthful			1
@entity74 is used to preserve some cereals , chewing gum and potato chips , according to the centers			1
it 's also used in rubber and petroleum products			2
butylated hydroxyanisole is " reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen , " according to the @entity84 ( @entity36 ) , because of animal studies that have shown that the chemical can cause tumors in rats ' and hamsters ' forestomachs ( something humans do n't have ) and fish livers			0
propyl gallate propyl gallate is often used in conjunction with @entity74 and a chemical called butylated hydroxytoluene , or @entity98			1
these antioxidant preservatives protect oily products from oxidation , which would otherwise cause them to go bad			1
propyl gallate can be found in mayonnaise , dried meats , chicken soup and gum , as well as hair - grooming products and adhesives			1
some scientists believe that propyl gallate is an " endocrine disruptor ( @entity36 ) , " meaning it can interfere with humans ' hormones			1
endocrine disruptors can lead to developmental , reproductive and / or neurological problems , according to the @entity84 , including fertility issues and an increased risk of some cancers			0
but the link between propyl gallate and the endocrine system needs to be studied further			1
sodium nitrite sodium nitrite is most often used in the preservation and coloring of meats , such as bacon , ham , hot dogs , lunch meat and smoked fish			0
without it , these products would look gray instead of red			2
sodium nitrite is also found naturally in many vegetables , including beets , celery , radishes and lettuce			0
but the nitrite found in vegetables comes with ascorbic acid , which prevents our bodies from turning nitrite into nitrosamines			0
nitrosamines are considered potentially carcinogenic to humans			0
so some companies are adding ascorbic acid to their meat products to inhibit nitrosamine formation , according to the @entity19 in the @entity20			2
however , the @entity154 points out the @entity155 conducted a multi-year review in which rats and mice were fed high levels of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water , and a panel reviewed the findings and concluded that nitrite is safe at the levels used and not a carcinogen			0
@entity168 ( @entity168 ) this chemical preservative is a form of butane that is used in crackers , potato chips and some fast food			0
it can also be found in varnish , lacquer and resin			0
it helps prolong the shelf life of food and , if it 's consumed at low levels , is considered safe			0
in higher doses -- above what the @entity6 says manufactures can use in food prep -- @entity168 has been found to cause " nausea , vomiting , ringing in the ears , delirium , a sense of suffocation , and collapse , " according to " a consumer 's @entity186			2
" it may also cause restlessness and vision problems			0
@entity198 dioxide , silica and calcium silicate silicon dioxide , also known as silica , is a naturally occurring material ( @entity36 ) made up of shells of tiny single - celled algae			1
you might also recognize it as sand , the kind that gets stuck in your suit at the beach			0
silicon dioxide is used in dry coffee creamer , dried soups and other powdery foods			1
it is also used as an insect repellent , removing the oily film that covers an insect 's body , causing them to dry out and die			1
the @entity221 concluded that the human health risk is low and " not unreasonable			0
" in rat studies , high - dose exposure has caused some lung problems			0
another study of @entity228 workers who were heavily exposed to the chemical showed a disproportionate number of deaths related to respiratory diseases , lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases			0
silicon dioxide has also been associated with the risk of developing autoimmune diseases -- again only after heavy exposure			1
@entity239 ( glycerol triacetate ) @entity239 , also known as glyceryl triacetate , has been approved and generally recognized as safe by the @entity6 as a food additive			1
in food , it is used as a plasticizer for chewing gum and gummy candy			0
it can be used to keep food from drying out and in some cookies , muffins and cakes			0
it is also used in perfume , cosmetics and cigarette filters and in drugs like @entity257 .			0

@entity12 is removing azodicarbonamide from its bread ; other chemicals remain
there are seven color additives approved by the @entity6 for use in foods
propyl gallate , @entity74 and @entity98 are used to preserve oily products such as mayonnaise
silicon dioxide is used in coffee creamer , dried soups and insect repellent
