-- for the first time , @entity1 has launched not one , but two iphones at its now - annual @entity6 launch event			1
as the rumors predicted , @entity1 has split its phone line into a premium all singing , all dancing flagship phone for the early tech adopters and one that will play to the so - called " budget " crowd looking for an iphone with a more colourful , youthful approach			1
the expected result ? a successful one			2
the @entity19 gives @entity1 an affordable phone for those that it has yet to lure into buying an @entity6 and @entity23			1
at the same time it has helped create a greater gulf between the two devices that was never really there with the @entity23 and the @entity15			0
now , early tech adopters who opt for the @entity29 -- compared to their parents or kids that will more than likely opt for the @entity19 -- can claim a faster , more powerful phone			1
it has greater connectivity , an abundance of sensors , including the new addition of fingerprint scanner called @entity41 , and more premium materials			0
watch more : will @entity1 get its mojo back ? it 's a clever move from @entity1 as it protects its justification for higher prices			1
it has , at the same time , created a phone for " the people , " that in reality is just as powerful as the previous flagship , the @entity6 5 , at a knocked - down price			0
not that the competition will be saying that			0
@entity55 - free , the new @entity19 is still expensive compared to the @entity56 and the @entity57			0
it might be budget , but @entity1 believes even this " cheaper " phone is the best on the market			1
even though it comes with an " unashamedly plastic shell , " in the words of @entity66 at @entity1 , you are still going to pay for it			1
that should n't be a problem			0
in the hand , it feels great and very much akin to the @entity71 and @entity70 we all raved about over five years ago			0
read more : hands - on impressions new hardware combined with new software is certainly enough for @entity1 at the moment			1
the naysayers will say that it 's not , that @entity1 has failed to innovate here and that there is n't much to woo you from @entity84 with its treats and tricks offered by @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity56			2
@entity1 's approach has always been about simplicity , about delivering a device that is easy to use , a device that is the best it can make			2
if you look at that remit , @entity1 's done it again			1
it has n't allowed itself to be sidetracked with gimmicks that sound impressive but are never used			0
@entity84 users will most likely tell you that they 've never used face recognition to unlock their phone , although they 've probably tried it			0
there is no eye - scrolling tech , movie modes that automatically make films from your footage , or ways to determine what wine you are drinking by snapping the label			2
read more : how your finger can become a password that , from a marketing message , could make the playability of the two devices sound limiting			0
but @entity1 prefers the tried and tested solid approach			2
these two phones might sway some @entity84 users across and probably sweep up most of the former @entity119 users			0
more importantly , they will open the @entity6 to a global audience that is looking for its first smartphone , especially in the new markets like @entity124 and @entity125 .			1

@entity1 has launched two new iphones , one for early adopters and one for budget crowd
tech *journalist* @entity130 says @entity1 is *staying* within its remit of *keeping* things simple
most importantly , the company is *expanding* in new markets like @entity124 and @entity125
