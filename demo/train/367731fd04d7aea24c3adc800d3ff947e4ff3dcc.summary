@entity0 -- @entity2 is embroiled in another controversy after the popular social networking site on monday temporarily disabled a page that calls for a boycott of oil giant @entity7			1
@entity2 officials said tuesday the site was removed in error through a technological glitch and has been restored			1
the @entity7 page aims to organize a worldwide boycott of @entity7 stations and all its brands in response to the disastrous oil spill in the @entity18			1
it urges visitors to " @entity7 stations until the spill is cleaned up			2
" in addition to the station boycott , it advocates boycotting @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , am / pm and even the @entity31			2
the group said it has more than 700,000 members			0
the site went down monday , with visitors redirected to @entity2 's home page			1
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity37 said there was nothing sinister behind the move , and an automated system mistakenly flagged the page for removal			1
" the administrative profile of the @entity47 page was disabled by our automated systems , therefore removing all the content that had been created by the profile , " a @entity2 statement said			1
" after a manual review , we determined the profile was removed in error , and it now has been restored along with the page			2
" the missing page prompted a protest from @entity58 , a nonprofit public interest group that has been promoting the boycott			2
it called the removal of the page irresponsible and said users should be given a better explanation			0
" i do n't think it 's much of an explanation at all , " said @entity65 , a @entity58 attorney			0
" they did n't explain why their system took it down , and just the fact that a community that large -- with more than 700,000 users -- could be taken down without explanation is problem			0
the automated system does n't tell us that much			1
" he added , " @entity2 and other social websites have become the public squares of the internet -- places where citizens can congregate as a community to share their opinions and voice their grievances			0
@entity2 's ownership of this democratic forum carries great responsibility			0
" @entity7 said it was n't involved			0
" we had absolutely nothing to do with this			0
when we were first asked about it we contacted @entity2 , and their mistake was rectified , " said @entity91 , a @entity7 spokesman			1
the controversy comes as the oil spill is in its 71st day , with @entity7 saying it is likely to take until august before relief wells might be able to stem the flow			0
the @entity7 page is filled with posts from users who decry @entity7 's handling of the spill , as well as a few who say a boycott is not the answer			1
@entity7 has more than 11,000 stations in the @entity108 , which sell more than 42 million gallons of gas a day			0
critics of the boycott note that @entity7 does n't own the stations -- independent franchisees do -- and they 're the ones who would be hurt			2
advocates said the target of the boycott is wide , and even if they ca n't make a dent in @entity7 's billions of dollars in sales , they can make a moral point .			1
