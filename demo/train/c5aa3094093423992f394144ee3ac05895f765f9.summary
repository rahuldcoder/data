@entity0 , @entity1 -- he 's only 25 now , an @entity4 paratrooper stationed at the headquarters of the @entity6 at a sprawling base near @entity0 in northern @entity1			2
as the first living recipient of the @entity10 since the @entity11 , @entity8 has had plenty of media attention heaped on him			1
but this staff sergeant is determined to make the medal , at least symbolically , belong to others			2
" when i first heard that they were putting me in for the @entity10 , i felt lost , i felt kind of angry , i felt , i think , angry , " he said in an exclusive interview			1
" just because , you know , this is so big			0
this is , it came at such a price			0
it came at the price of a good buddy of mine , not just @entity28			1
@entity29 died that night as well			0
and people want to put a medal around my neck			0
" @entity8 is talking about one of his best @entity4 friends , sgt. @entity28 , whose life he tried to save during a vicious firefight in eastern @entity39 's @entity38 in the fall of 2007			1
@entity8 's squadron , with @entity28 walking as " point " -- or first man in the front -- was trapped in a deadly ambush by @entity47 fighters during a nighttime operation			1
the squadron 's medic , @entity29 of @entity51 , @entity52 , was caught with the rest of the group			1
share your tributes to @entity57 and spc. @entity29 " people congratulate me on a good job when there 's two people that have basically given their entire lives for this mission , for the @entity4 , for the people of the @entity66 , " @entity8 said			1
" and now , i 'm gon na be the one they are gon na shake hands with and congratulate ? it did n't seem real and at the same time , what did seem real was that this should n't happen			0
" @entity8 , whose armor - plated vest took a bullet during the ambush , saw @entity47 fighters dragging away @entity28			1
@entity4 documents say he immediately began to fire at the two men dragging his buddy away , killing one and driving off the other			2
@entity8 pulled the badly - wounded @entity28 to protective cover and stood by him until medical help arrived			1
@entity28 , whose father is a policeman in @entity84 , @entity85 , died from his wounds the next day			1
" it is a great thing , " @entity8 said , speaking of the @entity10			1
" but it is a great thing that has come at a personal loss to myself and so many other families			0
" and that , he said , is what he wants @entity66 to know			0
" absolutely , " he said			0
" and not it 's just the soldiers out there doing it			2
it 's the @entity103 of this world			2
and @entity29 's parents , you know			0
the families that we leave when we go do this			0
" " it 's not just , we 're gon na go fight , but we 're gon na leave our families for a while and hope that they can be taken care of , " the sergeant explained			0
" it 's a sacrifice that everyone makes , and these two men on that day made the biggest sacrifice anyone can ever make			2
and it 's not for a paycheck			0
" @entity8 's @entity10 ceremony will take place in november at the @entity127			1
