-- are men stupid ? how else can we explain the endless parade of otherwise successful individuals , who by all appearances seem intelligent and competent , and yet risk destroying their careers and their personal lives over the chance to have a sexual escapade ? @entity10 crashing from the heights of promise to infamy , from presidential candidate to defendant in a trial after a secret affair ; @entity20 agents ending their careers in disgrace over dalliances with prostitutes in @entity25 , all join that long procession of men who managed to self - destruct , pulling a pin on the grenade of their careers and perhaps their personal lives for the sake of a little fun			1
the pageant of legacy - killing misjudgment includes a president , several might - have - been presidents , a few governors , a @entity40 director , a former @entity42 prime minister , an @entity44 president and one of the top golfers of all time			1
and that is only a partial list			2
how to explain it ? the question has baffled women , mostly , since biblical times			2
perhaps the @entity20 agents thought their behavior , if discovered , would raise no eyebrows			1
but the stupidity was in evidence when one of the agents , who had earlier " protected " @entity61 , posted on @entity62 that he was " checking her out			2
" sounds like the claim of a 13 - year - old boy			1
and the decision to post the comment displays the common sense of an 8 - year - old			1
but that level of maturity and judgment shines compared to the decision of , say president @entity75 , who risked his presidency to have an affair with @entity78 , and then lied about it repeatedly			2
a brilliant man , everyone said about the president , but also one of only two presidents in @entity85 history impeached			2
the @entity75 experience almost numbed us to the epidemic scale of the problem			2
over and over we hear stories that defy belief			1
men whose lives are filled with gifts and opportunity , men who have worked hard to achieve , risk it all and sometimes lose it all			1
there 's @entity10 , of course , he of the winning smile , the heart - warming marriage , the beautiful children , and the gorgeous hair , still young enough to contemplate another run at the @entity106 , now facing prison time after revelations that he had an affair , a child , and a complicated and foolish coverup during the last campaign another who might have reached the presidency , had he not succumbed to the same meltdown of reason is former @entity120 governor @entity119 , the law and order guy who threw it all away to cavort with prostitutes			1
he might have known someone would take relish in turning him in			2
some try to explain it as biology , testosterone 's fault , they say			0
others blame complex psychological needs			0
" the appeal of hookers lies in the temporary psychic relief they supply to men struggling with conflicts about guilt and responsibility , " wrote psychologist @entity135			1
but i believe the common denominator , the proximate cause of the irrational behavior , is arrogance ; the belief by some powerful men that they can get away with it			1
that the world is still their unchallenged domain , as it was years ago , when few people knew about a president bringing women to the @entity106 to have sex , as @entity158 did , or pressuring his secretary to yield to sexual advances , as was common			1
it is willful ignorance that the world has changed			0
the sudden - iq - drop syndrome affects @entity165 and @entity166 , @entity85 and @entity167 , people of all colors and professions			1
did @entity171 think nobody would even learn about his affairs , with more than a dozen alleged relationships ? did former @entity176 gov. @entity175 , a @entity166 , who could n't come up with an excuse so he simply disappeared to meet his @entity179 lover , think no one would find out ? then there 's the @entity165 congressman who might have become mayor of @entity120			0
@entity185 's tweeting ranks near the top of the stupidity charts			0
but the competition is arduous			0
@entity166 @entity189 answered a @entity191 ad with a photograph of his flexed biceps , describing himself as a " fit fun classy guy			0
" across the @entity200 , the man who almost everyone expected to become the next president of @entity198 , @entity197 , head of the @entity199 , married to a multi-millionaire , may or may not have assaulted a maid at his @entity120 hotel			0
( @entity197 denied the charges and the criminal case against him was dropped by prosecutors			0
he is seeking dismissal of a civil suit			0
) he now is under investigation in connection with procuring prostitutes for parties , a crime under @entity198 law			0
the former @entity42 prime minister , @entity215 , called it a " friendly gesture " after a woman accused him of " grabbing her behind			0
" @entity215 had served as prime minister of the @entity42 , crowning a stellar career with a post as @entity223 high commissioner for refugees , when the accusations came			1
a @entity223 investigation found no proof , but discovered a pattern of sexual harassment by the commissioner , which he also denied			0
that we 're finding out about these men , and that their political careers are in many cases ending , is a sign that society is changing			1
that it continues to happen , to seemingly intelligent , disciplined individuals , is a sign that the process will be slow			0
and that , in the final analysis , if it has to do with sex , some men really are stupid			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			0

@entity248 : @entity20 *scandal* is latest example of career - ending *misbehavior*
she says men in positions of power and *prominence* risk everything
@entity10 , a former presidential candidate , is on trial *due* to his misjudgment
@entity263 : the common cause is arrogance , the belief they can get away with it
