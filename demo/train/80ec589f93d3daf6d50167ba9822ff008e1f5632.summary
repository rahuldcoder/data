" this has been a very difficult year			0
very complicated , " @entity47 said thursday in a telephone interview			0

everywhere else , the anti-crime group works with community organizations			0
the city contacted @entity112 - based @entity104 this summer , @entity103 said			2
it was a necessary step , @entity47 said , because @entity33 residents " lost confidence in the police a long time ago			2

the calls will not be answered in @entity2 or the @entity21 , but in an undisclosed nation			0
@entity47 calls it " a sophisticated system that is digital , anonymous and coded			0
" the mayor said he believes @entity33 residents will embrace the program because they are familiar with @entity104 , which has been used in @entity128 , @entity2 , for more than 30 years and also in @entity31 , right across the border			1
" @entity104 is well - known in @entity33 , " he said			1
" it will be easy to convince them			0
" @entity104 guarantees anonymity , @entity103 said			2
" this way they can pass along the information and not have to worry about the repercussions , " he said			0
