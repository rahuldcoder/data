during 27 hours of swimming , she went from 1.5 mph than to more than 3 mph			2
many marathon swimmers say that 's deeply suspicious			2
her explanation ? it 's simple math , @entity1 said			1
and also a lucky stretch			2
she said she hit a perfect current that pushed her along at a quicker speed			2
" if you got lucky , which i did that day and i 'm swimming at 1.7 miles per hour i have a current at , let 's say , 2			0
2 miles per hour ... you add them together and you 're close to 4 miles an hour			0
