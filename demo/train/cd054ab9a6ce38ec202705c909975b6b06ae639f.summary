-- after nearly a week of high - heeled dancing , @entity4 - covered teeth , and skillfully concealed hostility , the glitter has finally settled over @entity6 — and 24 - year - old @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 has been named the latest in a long line of all - american beauty queens			1
@entity7 is n't just the second consecutive pageant winner from the @entity13 — she 's also the first woman of @entity15 descent to snag the crown			1
obviously , congratulations are in order — but @entity7 's not the only one who deserves a little recognition			2
check out my list of alternate - category winners , and feel free to add your own ... as long as you deliver them with a blindingly white smile			2
most auspicious name : miss @entity28 , a.k.a. @entity30			1
then again , maybe not ; she did n't even make it to the semi-finals			2
weirdest @entity34 : " listening to your phone calls from the nation 's capital			2
just kidding ! i 'm @entity40 , @entity41			2
" runner up : " from the home of fast horses and beautiful women — better not get those two things confused			2
i am @entity46 , miss @entity47 ! " best sports : misses @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57			1
other girls got to dance on @entity6 's boardwalk or the deck of a swanky boat ; this group had to pretend they were super pumped to deliver their intros inside the @entity65 sub shop			2
( and not even the location that serves salads ! ) most @entity68 : " from the home of @entity70 , the country music capital of the world and the hit @entity74 show , i 'm @entity75 , miss @entity76			1
" clumsiest attempt at @entity78 : " i 'm not breaking bad , i 'm breaking through			0
say my name ! @entity80 , miss @entity81			1
" @entity0 : bikinis , tattoos , lobster high heels , and more style secrets from the @entity88 pageant @entity89 in @entity90 : " our @entity91 sure are n't bringing home the championship			1
guess it 's up to me ! @entity96 , miss @entity97			1
" most anonymous experts : the team of pros who judged the pageant 's preliminary rounds			1
sorry , guys — if the hosts had actually said your names on camera , @entity107 would have had barely any time to mug			0
loosest definition of the term " celebrity @entity115 " : here 's our roll call : @entity119 , who shot for the moon but landed in @entity6 ; the aforementioned mr. @entity107 ; dr. @entity121 , a.k.a. @entity88 2005 ( so it really is a scholarship program ! ) ; @entity123 of @entity124 ; the @entity126 co-host and all - around great lady @entity127 ; subway busker @entity128 ; and @entity9 knick @entity129			1
what , @entity131 was busy ? @entity132 : @entity133 of @entity134 , proving why he usually does n't talk onstage : " it 's very good , and we 're very proud of our relationship with @entity138			0
" strangest tradition : the @entity140			0
seriously , what 's the deal with the shoe parade ? @entity144 : miss @entity54 @entity145 , who said this after preparing for the swimsuit competition in about two minutes : " i had time for hairspray and butt glue			1
" @entity153 glue ! i 'd have given her the crown based on butt glue alone			0
runner up : miss @entity158 @entity157 , a tattooed army sergeant who sings opera but prefers to play @entity160			1
" my original talent was going to be archery , " she explained			0
" i 'm singing by default because there is a clause against projectile objects			0
" there is no clause against stealing our hearts , though			0
@entity170 : miss @entity173 @entity172 's bedazzled knee brace , a functional yet versatile piece that complements bikinis , eveningwear , and ghastly baton - twirling getups equally			2
( maybe it was actually a good luck charm — @entity173 absolutely killed it in @entity179			0
) @entity0 : @entity88 pageant returns to @entity6 biggest head - scratcher : this fun fact , which flashed onscreen as miss @entity184 @entity183 sang " @entity185 " : " her dog has met the president			1
" think they shook hands ? worst judgment : @entity74 and the @entity88 determined that it was totally fair to ask the first finalist about @entity193 , the second about scorned political wives ... and the third whether she thinks the @entity196 should intervene in @entity197			1
one of those things : not like the others ! kudos to @entity201 for keeping her cool — and actually delivering a coherent answer to that absurdly tough question			0
most diplomatic : miss @entity208 @entity207 , who , for the record , believes that @entity193 's antics have been " a little bit not super tasteful " — but " ha [ s ] to respect her creativity			2
" most skillful non-answer : as delivered by eventual winner @entity7 , miss @entity9			1
she was asked what message @entity216 is sending by admitting that she 's had plastic surgery on her eyes			0
full transcript : " unfortunately , i do n't agree with plastic surgery			0
however , i can understand that from a standpoint			0
but more importantly , i 've always viewed @entity88 as the girl next door , and the girl next door is evolving as the diversity in @entity196 evolves			1
she 's not who she was 10 years ago , and she 's not going to be the same person come 10 years down the road			0
so i would n't want to change someone 's looks or appearance , but definitely be confident in who you are			0
" clearest foreshadowing : miss @entity9 and @entity237 stood in front of a curtain decorated with the @entity88 logo as they clutched hands , waiting to hear the panel 's final verdict			1
the logo includes a crown — which appeared to be floating over @entity9 's head			1
lesson learned for next year 's finalists : try to stand stage left			0
@entity250 : courtesy of @entity253 's " @entity252 , " which played as @entity7 received her actual crown : " tonight we 'll just get drunk			0
" sound advice for a celebratory @entity7 — as well as the pageant 's 52 losers			2
