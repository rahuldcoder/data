from @entity2 to @entity3 to @entity4 , the @entity0 is full of majestic , towering peaks that have long challenged people to climb them			1
this story is not about those			0
this story is about humbler summits -- some of them are n't even hills -- that beckon hikers in largely flat , low - lying parts of the country			2
they have modest names like @entity19 and @entity20 , and you can climb some of them in your slippers without breaking a sweat			0
why would you ? well , these summits are all notable for one thing : they 're the highest points in their states			2
and a certain variety of mountaineer -- peak baggers , they 're called -- will seek them out just for that reason			1
" if you 're a true peak bagger ... if that 's your mindset , then getting a state high point is a worthy goal , " said @entity36 , who runs @entity37 , a mountaineering site			1
" whether it 's @entity2 ( the @entity48 peak known officially as @entity2 ) or the @entity50 high point , they all count equally the same			1
" well , maybe not exactly			0
@entity2 is 20,320 feet high and requires weeks of planning to summit			2
@entity52 , in @entity50 's @entity53 , is a short stroll from your car			2
but if you want to climb all 50 state high points , as @entity36 has done , you need to bag the baby peaks along with the big ones			1
consider @entity59 -- a misnomer for sure -- a wooded bump in northern @entity62 that 's a short scramble from a church parking lot			0
or @entity65 's @entity64 , which sits on the flatlands of a former farm that is barely higher than the surrounding prairie			0
" there are a lot of states where the actual high point is less than a 10 - minute walk from your car , " @entity36 said			1
perhaps the least rugged of them all is 442 - foot high @entity79 , basically just a monument sign beside a road in suburban @entity82 , @entity83			1
a woman lives in a house across the street and sometimes greets visiting " hikers			0
" @entity36 , whose website keeps records of this stuff , estimates that fewer than 300 people have summited all 50 @entity0 high points			1
but while all the highest and most challenging peaks are in @entity95 states , @entity36 has a soft spot for many of the little ones in the @entity99 and coastal states of the @entity101			2
" if you 're into travel and exploring nooks and crannies of the country , it 's always fun to go to places you 've never been before , " he said			0
" sure , there may not be a lot to the actual hike			0
but the overall experience is definitely worthwhile			0

some " peak baggers " try to summit the highest point in all 50 @entity0 states
in states like @entity83 and @entity50 , the high points are n't even hills
expert : in many states , the actual high point " is less than a 10 - minute walk from your car "
