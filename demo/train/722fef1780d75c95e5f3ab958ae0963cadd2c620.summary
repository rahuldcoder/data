-- the 911 tape is frightening			2
" help me , please			2
he 's beating on me , " a woman tells the dispatcher , followed by " i hate you			0
" " i hate you , too , " a man 's voice can be heard in response			0
" she says that she 's in a domestic fight , and i can hear him hitting her now , " the initial dispatcher tells the ambulance dispatcher			1
this is not an exchange involving a pro football player and his girlfriend			0
the woman on the call is @entity21			0
the male attacker is her husband , @entity22 , a @entity23 district judge for the @entity24 of @entity25			1
on a saturday night at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity21 called the police for help from a hotel room			0
the @entity31 both admit to an altercation while blaming each other for the incident , according to a police report			0
if the @entity38 's pathetic handling of the domestic violence charges involving @entity40 and @entity41 makes you angry , then you 're going to blow a fuse over @entity21			1
he is poised not only to have this horrific scene expunged from his record but to return to the bench			0
the only body that can remove him is @entity49 , and no significant steps in that direction have been taken			1
instead , a bipartisan group of 16 female senators sent a letter to @entity38 commissioner @entity55 that read in part , " if you violently assault a woman , you should n't get a second chance to play football in the @entity38			2
" wait , it gets better			0
twelve @entity63 @entity62 who sit on the @entity65 sent a letter to @entity55 that marked the 20th anniversary of the @entity68 and included this gem : " given the important role the @entity38 and the other major professional sports leagues can play in shaping public perceptions concerning domestic violence , it would appear to be in the public interest to have the highest level of transparency associated with reviews of potential misconduct			1
" so while members of @entity49 insist that an organization it has no authority over should permanently remove perpetrators of domestic violence , they have not taken a similar public stance regarding the domestic violence perpetrator whom they actually can do something about			1
opinion : wife - beating is not a private matter in addition to writing letters to a pro sports team , the @entity63 has the power to impeach a federal judge who has done wrong			1
the @entity98 can try such cases			0
i guess jumping on a public outrage bandwagon is easier			2
no wonder more than 60 % of the country believes this is the worst @entity49 ever			2
for the public to be fixated on the @entity38 's problem is justifiable considering the popularity of the league and the graphic video depicting @entity40 punching his then - fiancee in a casino elevator			1
stories involving federal judges are not that popular			2
but lawmakers are not supposed to jump on the bandwagon ; they are supposed to take the lead			0
sending strongly worded letters to the @entity38 is not taking up a strong stance against domestic violence ; it 's a lazy publicity grab			1
if the 113th @entity49 -- particularly those members so concerned about the " @entity121 " -- truly wanted to lead on this issue , it would roll up its sleeves and remove the man who allegedly pulled his wife 's hair , threw her on the ground , dragged her , kicked her and struck her multiple times in the face			1
police said that when @entity21 opened the door , she had cuts on her mouth and forehead			0
when they entered the room , they found broken glass and hair on the floor , blood in the bathroom			0
the man involved is not a big - time @entity38 player , but does he have to be ? the night of the attack is not accompanied with a @entity150 video , but do we really need one ? the public may not even notice his removal , but does that really matter ? in sending two letters to the @entity38 regarding domestic violence , @entity49 has stated it expects a high bar to be set for professional athletes			1
why should @entity49 ' bar be lower for public officials whose job is to defend the law of the land ? in other words , if @entity40 should be banned from the @entity38 for life , then why not @entity22 from the @entity167 ? now , granted , removing a federal judge is not easy			1
since 1803 , only 15 have been impeached , and acquittals were granted in four of those cases			0
it is a daunting task			0
but so is seriously addressing the cancer that is domestic violence			1
anyone who looks at the @entity40 video can point a finger at him and the league			0
and those members of @entity49 who signed those letters and have not had a conversation about @entity21 's removal should be ashamed of themselves			1
@entity185 , judging from polling numbers , that 's one of many things this @entity49 should be ashamed of .			2

@entity23 district court judge @entity22 allegedly attacked his wife in a domestic fight
@entity192 : @entity49 has the power to remove a federal judge who has done wrong
but members of @entity49 are busy *criticizing* the @entity38 on domestic violence issues
@entity192 : if @entity49 sets high bar for @entity38 , it should set high bar for public officials
