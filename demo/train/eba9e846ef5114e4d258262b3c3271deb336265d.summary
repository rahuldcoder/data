-- shopping for some aplicaciones ? @entity2 is surprising and frustrating some visitors to the new web - based android app store by greeting them in a foreign tongue			1
the website appears to choose which language to display based on the geographic location of the visitor 's internet address , and that detection method can be pretty good at guessing a person 's language preference			1
but for people traveling abroad , living in foreign countries or accessing the web through an international proxy service , @entity2 's guess can be awkwardly wrong			1
on other @entity2 sites , people can navigate to domains that cater to a specific language , or designate their choice with a link called " language tools			1
" no such navigation is available on the online @entity27			2
a @entity2 spokesman said the @entity27 site is designed only for @entity32 - based @entity31 speakers			1
more languages will be added to the site in coming weeks , the spokesman said			0
there was no mention of this restriction at last week 's ribbon cutting for the @entity27 website			1
the announcement on the @entity42 blog did , however , say it would start out as @entity31 - only			0
some @entity27 fans were miffed to learn that @entity2 seemed not to cater to them			1
@entity44 from @entity45 , @entity46 , tipped off @entity0 to the language problems with the @entity27 website			1
@entity44 was traveling to @entity48 and lamented the " missing feature " for setting a language			0
this comes as @entity27 phones continue to surge in popularity			2
handsets running @entity27 made up 22.7 % of all smartphones sold worldwide last year , according to a report from research firm @entity57			2
many of those customers do not live in the @entity32			0
there is a work - around for the problem , however			0
on @entity2 's support forum , users suggested adding this text -- " ? hl = en " -- to the end of the site 's web address in order to tell the browser to load the site in @entity31			1
swap " en " for " es , " and you get @entity74 ; or " fr " for @entity76 ; and so on			0
@entity2 also offers an internet translation service			0
still , dozens of @entity27 users continued to flock to @entity2 message boards to express frustrations			2
" many sites these days try to be smart and automatically change their language without giving you the option to change it back , " said one person who speaks @entity31 but lives in @entity82			0
" there should always be the option to change it , clearly labeled on the site			0
" in another message , an @entity27 user wrote : " i am traveling , and i want things in @entity31 , but i get @entity93 instead			0
" @entity96 , on the support board , offered this plea : " @entity2 , please respond , in any language			2

the @entity27 website chooses a language based on where a visitor is located
this can be a pain for people who do *n't* speak the national language or for travelers
@entity2 says it 's working on versions for other countries and languages
