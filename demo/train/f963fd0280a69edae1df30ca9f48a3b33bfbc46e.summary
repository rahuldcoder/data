-- it 's been a weekend of contrasting fortunes for @entity4 club owners in the @entity5			1
the @entity7 family can look forward to @entity9 's imminent record - extending 20th league title , and their fifth since a leveraged takeover in 2005 that left one of the world 's wealthiest clubs saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars of debt			1
for @entity19 , owner of saturday 's beaten opponents @entity18 , the prospect of losing top - flight status is all too real after a 1 - 0 defeat that left his team just one point above the relegation zone and marked the end of the reign of manager @entity27 after less than two seasons			1
he was replaced sunday by controversial former @entity30 forward @entity29 , whose previous managerial club job was with @entity34 third division side @entity32			2
one of @entity27 's former players , @entity36 , has been seemingly on the verge of the sack for most of this season but the @entity41 manager seems likely to see it out despite sunday 's 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity44 , which kept his side in the bottom three but only four points behind 12th - placed @entity47			1
" yes , definitely , " @entity36 said when asked if his team could avoid the drop , with seven games to play			0
" i think anybody who was here today would say the same			0
we 're certainly playing well enough			0
we do n't look like a team down the bottom at the minute			2
" if we keep going the way we 're going , we 'll win more games than not			2
there will be so many twists and turns			0
" @entity36 has been consistently backed by @entity41 's @entity60 owner @entity59 , who has focused on @entity41 since ending his ownership of @entity63 team the @entity64 in august 2012			1
@entity59 , who in 2006 became only the second owner of an @entity5 club , fell out with @entity27 ahead of the 2010 - 11 season and replaced the @entity68 with @entity69 and @entity70 before appointing @entity36 last june			1
the @entity71 , with considerably smaller finances to work with than his predecessors , has stuck doggedly to his task of shaping a new team out of young talent -- the most notable being 22 - year - old @entity78 striker @entity77 , who struck his 18th goal this season to put the 1982 @entity82 champion ahead against @entity44			1
@entity44 boss @entity83 has , likewise , been backed by his club 's @entity4 owners -- @entity86 -- to overhaul the team and try to return to the glory days of the 1970s and ' 80s in which the team won four of its five continental crowns and 11 of 18 @entity34 championships			2
the experiment is still a work in progress , but a mixture of youth and experience came up trumps on sunday as 22 - year - old midfielder @entity100 and veteran captain @entity101 -- with a 60th - minute penalty after @entity103 was fouled -- replied with the goals that lifted seventh - placed @entity44 to within five points of @entity82 qualification			1
if the @entity107 ca n't close that gap then @entity83 wo n't again have the distractions of the @entity111 next season , so one of his main aims will be to keep 29 - goal striker @entity103 at the club			1
the @entity115 heads the @entity5 charts with 23 and has already suggested that he would consider any offer from clubs playing in top competitions such as the @entity120			1
" we do n't have to sell him for the money , " @entity83 said			0
" he 's very happy			2
we 're trying to build a group here and add to it			0
we want to keep striving forward			0
" @entity103 returned to @entity34 from his country 's midweek @entity4 @entity127 qualifier against @entity129 , a 2 - 0 defeat in which he was booked -- triggering a suspension for the next match in june against @entity135 -- and also seemingly punched an opponent in the face , which may result in further action by @entity140			1
" he came back late on thursday , " @entity83 said			0
" he was in training on friday and i was thinking how tired he was -- his face , his body			0
he just looked totally shattered from all the travel and exertions from the game			0
" but you look at him today -- his energy and willingness to work for the team , and then just his sheer quality			0
his imagination in the game is incredible			0
" he really frightens defenders , and that led to a penalty			2

@entity101 's second - half penalty gives @entity44 2 - 1 *victory* at @entity41
win keeps @entity44 in the hunt for @entity111 place , leaves @entity41 in bottom three
both clubs have @entity60 ownership and are *struggling* to *regain* past glories
@entity44 manager hails @entity103 and *insists* @entity5 's top *scorer* will not be sold
