police chief @entity13 is on paid administrative leave , mayor @entity12 said tuesday			1
" i do think that is something that we do need to look into and make sure that things are being done properly in our police department , " @entity12 said			1
" there 's a lot of things that have come to light that i think does warrant us to take a second look			1
" in addition , the gender and race of the people involved in the incidents will be investigated , and reporting requirements will be tightened , he said			2
" i think that we , as the city of @entity2 , do need to make sure that the residents and people who are coming into our community are being handled properly , " he said			1
but @entity12 expressed confidence in police , whose job is to maintain order among the 36,000 residents of @entity2 , where the average income was $ 17,685 , according to the @entity45			1
" i will say , if there 's anyone we find that is not doing what they should be doing , we will do disciplinary actions to those officers , " he said			1
" but i think , all in all , if you look at our department , we have a fine police force			1
" over the past four years , the department has been involved in some 88 use - of - force incidents , the mayor said			1
asked how many of them were investigated at the time they occurred , @entity12 said that will be part of the newly announced investigation , which is to be completed by february 1			1
@entity12 said the six cases came to light after publicity surrounding the november case of @entity69 , who died days after police allegedly beat him and used a taser on him during a domestic abuse call to his house			1
" i 'm a mother who lost her son by a beating , " his mother , @entity74 , told reporters recently			2
lawyer @entity79 is representing @entity81 's family and three other alleged victims in the cases under investigation			1
@entity79 said the @entity85 has a problem with a group of officers that have repeatedly beat people			0
" i think there are very good officers on the force , but it looks like the problem is in the night shift that is not very well supervised , " said @entity79			1
" there is about 10 that call themselves a gang			0
we have heard stories that they handcuff people and tell them they have a time period to run before they are beaten			0
so basically they are making them run , so that they can get a chance to beat them up			0
" @entity79 said his law firm has heard from more than 30 people who plan to come forward and tell their story about abuse from local police			1
" they were scared before , but now they want to tell their stories , " @entity79 said			0
" i am glad the mayor did this			1
this is the first step			0
but why did it take someone dying before someone finally did something ? " in a case that occurred last october , @entity123 , 31 , of @entity124 , said he was preparing to leave his job as a bouncer at a @entity2 bar when a policeman pulled up shortly before midnight			1
the radio in @entity123 's @entity131 was cranked , which apparently bothered the policeman , @entity123 said			2
" he told me he was towing the car for loud music , " @entity123 said			0
@entity123 said he took his house keys out of his car 's ignition and was walking away from the policeman toward the bar when he was struck repeatedly by electroshocks			2
" he just tased me in my back for no reason and kept doing it			0
i did n't understand that			0
" the officer fired a taser at least six times into his back , he said			0
" i ran ' til i could n't take no more of the shockage , and then i just fell out			0
i was asking him why was he tasing me			0
" at least two of the @entity147 strikes hit him while he was on the ground , he said			0
the officer then took @entity123 to jail , where he was charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer , which he denies			2
" i never touched him , so i do n't know where that came from			0
" the next day , after he was released , @entity123 drove himself to a hospital for treatment of burns and bruises on his back			0
he said he stayed out of work for two weeks , had to pay $ 600 to get his car back and has not yet determined what he owes the hospital			0
@entity123 said he has not filed a complaint but has contacted a lawyer about his treatment by the police			2
" they are just losing their minds for some reason , " he said			0
in another incident , a police video was played at a city council meeting last month that appeared to show an officer punching a detainee in the head and putting him in a choke hold			2
a woman who answered the telephone tuesday night at the police department said no one was available to talk to the news media .			2
