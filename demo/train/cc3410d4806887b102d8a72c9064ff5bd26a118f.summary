-- have you been wondering if that new @entity3 smartphone you purchased is really getting 4g speeds ? wonder no longer			2
@entity5 performed an extensive study to determine how each network 's 4g speeds are holding up to their claims			1
the testing was performed across the @entity12 area			0
their findings showed that @entity15 's @entity8 performed at a 100 percent data - success rate			1
its average data speeds were between four and 14.5 times faster than competitors , and average upload speeds were between 4.7 and 49.3 times faster			1
the phone models tested included the @entity22 ( @entity15 ) , @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) and @entity27 ( @entity28 )			0
@entity5 ' ceo @entity29 said that the smartphone model and its hardware had very little to do with @entity3 performance -- that performance is almost all network related			0
@entity0 has previously broken down what each carrier means by @entity3 , and what speeds should be expected from each service			0
@entity15 's @entity8 network promises speeds of 5 - 12 mbps down and 1 - 5 mbps up ; @entity24 's @entity41 + network should provide 6 @entity43 down ( and they plan to upgrade to @entity8 in 2011 ) ; @entity26 's wimax technology promises an average of 3 - 6 @entity43 down and 0.6 - 1.4 mbps up ; and @entity28 's @entity41 + is supposed to provide 5 - 10 @entity43 down			1
@entity24 has reportedly been capping 4g speeds on @entity48 handsets , but this has not been definitively verified			2
over in @entity52 , @entity53 , the folks at @entity51 decided to perform a 4g speed test of their own using the @entity23 and @entity22			0
using @entity56 's services and the phones ' @entity58 hotspot modes , they discovered median speeds of 8.85 @entity43 down and 3.68 up on @entity15 's @entity8 , and 2.16 mbps down and .16 up on @entity24 's hspa + service -- on par with @entity5 ' results			1
@entity5 was careful to point out that merely achieving high data speeds does n't mean much unless it happens on a regular basis , though			0
it found that @entity15 's @entity3 download speeds were greater than 10 mbps about 90 percent of the time , and their upload speeds were between 5 and 10 mbps 100 percent of the time			1
and @entity15 's average upload speeds were faster than every other carrier 's average download speeds by 37 percent			1
a graph of how often each 4g service achieved a certain range of download speeds ( from 0 - 500 kbps to greater than 10 mbps ) shows @entity15 dominating the high end , @entity24 spending most of its time in the lower half , and @entity26 and @entity28 's services ranging widely throughout			2
how will @entity24 and @entity28 's recently announced merger affect their 4g services ? that 's yet to be seen			0
" our results stand alone and provide interesting context around consumer data experience for both carrier 's networks in the @entity12 area , " said a representative from @entity5			2
until it is known how and if the two carriers will combine their networks , it 's difficult to say how the merger will affect their future 4g service			0
but it 's safe to say , unless it 's @entity8 , it wo n't hold a candle to @entity15 's network			1
