@entity0 -- while conservatives are still seething over last week 's @entity6 ruling saving president @entity8 's health care overhaul , top @entity3 @entity2 are gleefully using the decision to fire up their base with promises of a repeal in 2013			1
the high court 's 5 - 4 decision " underscores the urgency of repealing this harmful law in its entirety , " house speaker @entity13 , @entity14 , said shortly after last thursday 's ruling			1
" republicans stand ready to work with a president who will listen to the @entity24 people			0
" @entity26 majority leader @entity25 , @entity27 , announced that his @entity29 - controlled chamber will vote on a full repeal on july 11			0
while the @entity26 is certain pass the measure -- it 's already done so once before -- the largely symbolic bill has no chance of clearing the @entity36 - run @entity35			0
but what if @entity37 is elected president in november while @entity2 hold the @entity26 and win a majority in the @entity35 ? could that be enough to undo @entity8 's signature legislative accomplishment ? @entity29 strategists believe they could essentially gut the law , thanks in part to the wording of chief justice @entity48 ' controlling opinion			1
read the high court 's @entity50 ruling @entity48 ruled that the controversial individual mandate -- the core part of the law forcing @entity24 to pay a fine if they do n't have health insurance -- is actually a tax			1
and a complex congressional rule known as reconciliation would allow republicans to change certain tax and spending components of the health care law with only a bare @entity35 majority			1
" the chief justice said ( the mandate ) is a tax , and taxes are clearly what we call reconcilable , " senate minority leader @entity63 , @entity64 , said on @entity65			1
" that 's the kind of measure that can be pursued with 51 votes in the @entity35			0
and if i 'm the leader of the majority next year , i commit to the @entity24 people that the repeal of ' @entity50 ' will be job one			0
" the reconciliation process could also be used to strip funding for the statute , one senior @entity29 strategist told @entity1			0
@entity36 used reconciliation in 2010 to pass a package of amendments to the health care law			0
republicans blasted the move at the time , calling it an unreasonable manipulation of the legislative process			0
reconciliation matters because in today 's sharply polarized political climate , most legislation ca n't clear the 100 - member @entity35 without a filibuster - proof of majority of 60 votes			1
right now , the @entity2 control 47 @entity35 seats			2
while most political analysts believe the @entity29 has a decent shot at a net pickup of four seats this fall , almost nobody believes the @entity2 can gain 13 seats			2
in the meantime , top congressional republicans have latched onto the notion that the individual mandate is a tax -- something @entity29 leaders believe plays into one of the @entity36 ' main political weaknesses			1
@entity50 is " not a good idea ( and ) i think you saw one of the reasons why -- because it 's a tax increase , " @entity115 sen. @entity114 , a possible @entity29 vice presidential nominee , said saturday			1
" it 's a massive tax increase on the middle class			0
" while @entity36 leaders still maintain the mandate is not a tax -- instead calling it a penalty -- roughly 60 % of @entity24 believe it is , according to a @entity1 / @entity130 poll released monday			0
the poll also notes that while an overwhelming majority of @entity29 voters oppose the mandate , 55 % of independents do as well			2
@entity2 @entity35 candidates are now being told that " every day you are not talking about ( the health care issue ) is a day you 've wasted , " according to a @entity0 - based @entity29 strategist			1
one potential wrinkle in any @entity29 plans to call the individual mandate a new @entity36 tax : @entity37 's health care overhaul in @entity143 also included a mandate			2
" this was a plan that , that gov. @entity37 supported , " @entity26 chief of staff @entity145 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity146			0
" " it 's something that i would think that he would have been proud of			0
" pressed on the issue monday , @entity37 senior campaign adviser @entity151 told @entity153 that the presumptive @entity29 presidential nominee agrees " with the dissent written by @entity156 which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax			2
" @entity151 bucks @entity2 line on ' @entity50 ' as ' tax ' asked repeatedly if @entity37 agrees with @entity8 and @entity36 that the penalty tied to the mandate is not tax , @entity151 eventually said , " that 's correct			1

@entity2 say they can use reconciliation to overturn large parts of @entity50
reconciliation lets a bare @entity35 majority change certain tax and spending rules
@entity29 leaders are also using the issue to fire up their conservative base
