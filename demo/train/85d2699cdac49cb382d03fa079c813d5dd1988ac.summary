@entity0 -- a @entity3 farm admitted to dumping dead pigs into @entity5 , which had about 6,000 bloated carcasses pulled from its water this week , state media reported			1
the labels in the ears of the pigs indicated @entity12 as their birthplace , according to @entity14 , the @entity3 state - run news agency			1
the city is south of @entity17 , in the @entity18			0
earlier , local @entity3 media had suggested the dead pigs had come from the area with local officials blaming dumping on " local pig farmers who lack awareness of laws and regulations			1
" the city 's government said a total of 70,000 pigs died from " crude raising techniques and extreme weather " at the beginning of the year , according to @entity14			2
but it also insisted that the collected corpses were disposed safely			0
the selling of diseased pigs appears to be a bigger problem in the area as on wednesday , a court in @entity18 , issued prison sentences for 46 people convicted of selling meat from diseased pigs , @entity14 said			2
the sentences ranged from six months to 6 and a half years in prison , the report said			0
@entity17 water concerns the " dead pig dumping scandal " in @entity17 has been growing since friday , @entity14 reported			1
@entity3 officials have said they expect to find more carcasses in the river -- but they insist the @entity17 water is fine			1
the scandal has incredulous residents one - upping each other on the country 's popular microblog service , @entity56			1
" since when is finding dead rotting pigs in a major river not a public health problem ? " weibo user , @ @entity61 , asked			2
" answer : when this happens in @entity3			1
" a report in the @entity67 newspaper earlier wednesday said that no pollution had been found in the river			2
" since apparently , the water has not been contaminated , big leaders , please go ahead and have the first drink , " @entity56 user , @ _ @entity74 quipped			1
however , a later water sample was found to contain a porcine circovirus , @entity14 said			1
the @entity77 says there are two types of porcine circoviruses , but neither is known to cause disease in humans			2
an official from a @entity17 water plant was quoted in @entity14 saying , " if the water is contaminated , we will put more the disinfectants and activated carbon to purify the water			2
" ' dead pigs all around ' sanitation workers , clad in masks and plastic suits , have been fishing the bruised pig bodies surfacing in the @entity5			1
the pink , decomposing blobs have wreaked foul odors and alarmed residents			0
" there were dead pigs all around and they really stunk , " one local resident told @entity1			2
" of course , we 're worried , but what can you do about it ? it 's water that we have to drink and use			0
" if the water treatment process is very effective and can handle the sudden glut of contaminants , it 's possible to minimize the impact , said @entity112 , a senior research consultant specializing in water quality at the @entity114			0
however , " most treatment plants would not be designed to accommodate that level of shock loading			0
it 's such an unusual event , " he added			0
@entity112 spoke in general terms about water quality issues , as he is not involved with @entity17 's water treatment			0
" if they are chlorinating heavily , which a lot of places may do , especially if they 've got a very polluted water body to start with , then the effects could potentially be small , " @entity112 said			0
pig corpses that have been in the water for days would leak blood , intestinal fluids and other pollutants , which could alter the taste and color of tap water			1
many residents have begun drinking bottled water due to fears of contamination , according to the @entity140 , a @entity3 newspaper			1
ripe for satire the agricultural commission in @entity3 said it had tested organ samples from the pigs and the results suggested the animals had contracted a porcine circovirus			1
on tuesday , national officials acknowledged the pig incident in a press conference tuesday			0
" according to monitoring statistics , there 's no evidence to show that there 's an outbreak of any major animal epidemics , " said @entity151 , the national vice minister of agriculture			0
" but in the meantime , the incident shows how we need to improve our work in the future			0
" the situation appeared ripe for satire			0
a movie poster for " @entity166 " was doctored and replaced with " @entity167 , " with the main character 's boat filled with dead pigs , and the water dotted with the bruised corpses			1
one weibo user , @ @entity174 , joked : " i finally figured out why drinking boiled water makes me gain weight -- because it is in fact pork soup ! " local authorities say they 're looking into how the pigs ended up in the river			1
