-- president @entity1 acknowledged friday that the @entity3 " crossed a line " and tortured @entity5 detainees after the 9/11 terror attacks			1
the comments at a @entity9 news conference were the president 's strongest on the controversial subject since he came into office denouncing what he described as the @entity14 years of torturing alleged terrorists , also known as " enhanced interrogation			2
" " when we engaged in some of these enhanced interrogation techniques , techniques that i believe and i think any fair - minded person would believe were torture , we crossed a line , " @entity1 said			1
" and that needs to be ... understood and accepted			0
and we have to , as a country , take responsibility for that so that hopefully we do n't do it again in the future			0
" in the remarks , @entity1 was referring to a soon - to - be - released @entity32 report detailing the @entity34 's controversial interrogation and detention program following the 9/11 attacks			1
the document is a nearly 700 page summary of the full 6,800 page report that was approved a year and a half ago by a committee sharply divided along party lines			0
senators on the committee have said the report is critical of the @entity34 's treatment of terrorism suspects , saying it amounted to torture -- an allegation @entity34 officials have denied			1
it also finds that those harsh interrogation techniques did not help disrupt future terrorist attacks as many in intelligence community have claimed			1
sen. @entity53 said later friday that the report 's public release will be delayed because of " significant redactions " by the @entity34			1
" we need additional time to understand the basis for these redactions and determine their justification , " the @entity58 @entity57 said in a statement			0
" therefore , the report will be held until further notice and released when that process is completed			2
" the report was returned to the committee friday			0
its creation has been controversial , with the @entity34 director apologizing after admitting that the agency spied on computers used by @entity32 staffers who prepared it			1
a public version was expected to be released as early as next week			0
in january 2009 , president @entity1 issued an executive order disavowing torture and established a @entity81 on @entity82			1
details of those findings have never been made public			0
" after i took office , one of the first things i did was to ban some of the extraordinary interrogation techniques that are the subject of that report , " @entity1 said friday			1
" and my hope is that this report reminds us once again that , you know , the character of our country has to be measured in part not by what we do when things are easy , but what we do when things are hard			0
" in april 2009 , @entity1 reiterated his position that waterboarding amounted to torture and " violates our ideals and our values			2
" " that 's why i put an end to these practices , " he said at the time			0
" i am absolutely convinced it was the right thing to do -- not because there might not have been information that was yielded by these various detainees who were subjected to this treatment , but because we could have gotten this information in other ways , in ways that were consistent with our values , in ways that were consistent with who we are			0
