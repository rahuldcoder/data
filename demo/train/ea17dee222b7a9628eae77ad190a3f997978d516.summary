-- pope @entity1 rang in his first @entity2 at the @entity3 with a @entity4 preaching a message of love and forgiveness			1
" on this night , let us share the joy of the @entity10			0
he so loves us that he gave us his son to be our brother , to be light in our darkness			1
to us the @entity15 repeats , ' do not be afraid , ' ... and i , too , repeat , do not be afraid , ' " the @entity1 said			1
" our father is patient			0
he loves us , he gives us @entity18 to guide us on the way which leads to the promised land			2
@entity18 is the light who brightened the darkness			1
he is our peace and light			2
" he called on the throngs gathered at @entity27 on tuesday to cast aside hatred			1
" @entity11 is light and in him there is no darkness at all			1
yet on the part of the people , there are times of both light and darkness , fidelity and infidelity , obedience and rebellion , times of being a pilgrim people , and times of being a people adrift , " the @entity1 said			1
" in our personal history , too , there are both bright and dark moments , lights and shadows			0
if we love @entity11 and our brothers and sisters , we walk in the light			1
but if our heart is closed , if we are dominated by pride , deceit , self - seeking , then darkness falls within us , and around us			2
whoever hates his brother -- writes the @entity59 -- is in the darkness ; he walks in the darkness , and does not know the way to go , because the darkness has blinded his eyes			2
" before the @entity4 , pilgrims gathering in @entity3 told @entity0 they were excited to celebrate with the @entity1			1
" we want to share this special moment with a person who is a beloved person , and we appreciate all he 's doing , " one woman said			0
nine months into his papacy , much has been made of the @entity1 's reforms , among them more scrutiny at the @entity3 bank , changes to the church 's bureaucratic structure , and a commission to deal with the abuse of minors			1
and while this year 's @entity2 liturgy remains the same , experts say we should expect the unexpected			0
" he tends to be a surprise , because he does things that are normal , but are very abnormal in terms of the papacy , " said @entity84 , a @entity3 analyst			1
" he brought three homeless men into where he is living to have breakfast with him on his birthday			0
... i suspect we will see something else again over the @entity2 period			0
" the festivities began on saturday , with the @entity1 's @entity2 message to the @entity99			2
he urged the church 's governing body to avoid gossip and to focus on service			0
and then he practiced what he preached , spending three hours at a local hospital bringing @entity2 cheer to sick children			0
there were a record number of requests to attend this year 's @entity111 on christmas day , tens of thousands of pilgrims are expected to flood @entity113 to hear his message to the world			0
" people are listening to him , because he 's speaking in a language that 's not @entity119 , " @entity84 said			0
" he 's speaking the language of ordinary people			0

the @entity1 urges faithful to cast aside hatred
he leads his first @entity4 at the @entity3
" @entity11 is light and in him there is no darkness at all , " the @entity1 says
