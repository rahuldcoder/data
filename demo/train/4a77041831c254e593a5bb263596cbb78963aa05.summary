-- he thought the bleeding was a hemorrhoid , brought on by a strenuous weightlifting session at the gym			2
he thought the fatigue was due to his life on the road , performing coast - to - coast with the band @entity11 's lead singer , @entity10			1

@entity14 , the country musician best known for his no. 1 hit " @entity16 , " spent @entity17 in the hospital			1

it 's also the most preventable			0
colorectal cancer usually develops slowly , over the course of 10 to 15 years , from noncancerous polyps			1

the @entity65 recommends colonoscopies every 10 years for people beginning at that age , unless they have high risk factors such as a family history of colorectal cancer or another gastrointestinal disease			1
colonoscopies can spot and remove polyps before they become malignant			0
coming clean about my first colonoscopy " @entity85 , [ colorectal cancer ] has no symptoms , " says dr. @entity82 , a gastrointestinal cancer prevention specialist at the @entity29 who has not treated @entity14			1
" the most important message is that people really should understand that screening should be done regularly			0
it could make a substantial difference in the number of lives saved			0
" @entity14 had no family history of gastrointestinal disease , which is one of the reasons he ignored his symptoms for so long			1
in fact , when he walked into the hospital in november , he was in better shape than everyone in the waiting room , @entity47 remembers			2
since then , @entity14 has lost 50 pounds and is struggling to regain a sense of normalcy through multiple rounds of chemotherapy			1
he 's fighting an uphill battle -- a 2004 study published in the @entity111 estimated the five - year survival rate for @entity113 colon cancer to be 8.1 % , and an institute study of cancer data put the survival rate at 6 %			1
" it hurts like hell , " @entity14 says of his recovery			1
" i always thought of myself as a man 's man , but i just discovered what a wuss i am			0
" thankfully , @entity14 is anything but alone in @entity126			1

@entity129 helped him connect with the best doctors in the city			0
@entity132 from @entity133 arranged for a private room at @entity135			0
" that part of it has been really shocking for me			0
i had no idea how many people cared about me or even knew i existed			0
" @entity47 says that 's the kind of person @entity14 is -- modest to a fault ; an introvert who enjoys reading detective dramas and has no desire to just sit around			1
@entity14 lives with his dog , @entity148 , a boxer he found as a stray , eating out of the garbage at a filling station 75 miles from @entity126			1
he loaded the starving , tick - covered dog into the back of his truck and took him home , where @entity148 proceeded to chew on everything in sight			0
" he 's very lovable but a pain the ass -- just like me , " @entity14 says with a laugh			1
@entity14 ' scans were clear of tumors in early march			1
but the musician still has four more months of chemotherapy to go			0
@entity166 has left his hands and mouth incredibly sensitive			0
food tastes funny , and touching anything cold feels like " being electrocuted			0
" some days , he has trouble gripping his guitar			0
he performed at the @entity175 benefit concert for @entity176 on march 6 but had trouble singing because of the chemo 's effects on his vocal cords			0
he 's eager to get back to writing music , but the chemotherapy chemicals invading his body make it difficult to concentrate			0
" he 's seen something taken away that he 's very passionate to get back to , " @entity47 says of @entity14 ' impatience			1
" he 's always bounced back from everything			0
i think he thought he 'd have the surgery , and then			0
... the recovery has taken longer than he expected			0
" still , @entity14 is doing his best to help the process along			1

a low - fat , high - fiber diet is good , as is regular exercise			0
" in general , things that are healthy overall , are healthy for your colon , " @entity82 says			2
so @entity14 is eating less red meat , more fruits and vegetables			1

" if i had caught it early , i would n't be where i am now			0
