@entity3 dominated the @entity11 who suffered their worst ever @entity6 defeat			0
with @entity15 winning 5 - 1 at @entity16 also on sunday , it proved a superb day for the two @entity18 clubs , who are level at the top with a maximum nine points from their three games			1

@entity9 , who sold star players @entity24 and @entity36 this month , were always struggling to cope with the home side once @entity38 headed @entity3 into the lead following hesitancy in the defense			2
and @entity9 then wasted a golden chance to level when captain @entity44 's penalty was saved by @entity3 keeper @entity45 after @entity46 pulled back @entity47			1
@entity3 soon made them pay when @entity48 curled home a superb second before @entity1 's brilliant free - kick made it 3 - 0			1
@entity47 pulled a goal back for @entity9 just before half - time from an acute angle , but @entity3 restored their advantage with another trademark @entity1 free - kick in the 64th minute			1
by now , @entity3 were running riot , and @entity59 made it 5 - 1 after being left free in the penalty area to clip the ball into the net			1
substitute @entity63 added a sixth before @entity44 scored from close range to make it 6 - 2			2
@entity9 then had defender @entity67 sent off for a second yellow card -- meaning the club have had a player dismissed in each of their first three matches			0
and soon after , @entity1 completed his hat - trick from the penalty spot after @entity47 's foul on @entity59			1
the humiliation was completed when @entity48 matched his first - half strike with another superb effort in injury time			0
the defeat , the first time @entity9 had conceded eight goals in a league game since 1896 , increased the pressure on manager @entity85 , with new signings expected to arrive before the deadline for trades on wednesday			1
" of course it hurts , it 's humiliating , but you could see that we had not recovered physically in the second half from wednesday night 's win over @entity95 , " @entity85 told the official @entity9 website			0
" we were short in some areas , that is for sure			0
they have class and they punished us			0
it was 3 - 1 at half - time and i think that was harsh against us			2
" we missed a penalty , we had a chance to get back to 3 - 2			2
we tried desperately to get back but we opened ourselves up and were punished			0
their finishing was great today , " added the @entity107			0
@entity3 's performance was matched by the dazzling display of big - spending rivals @entity15 , with @entity114 striker @entity113 scoring four goals in their rout of @entity16 at @entity117			1
with @entity107 @entity36 in fine form on his debut following his move from @entity9 , @entity15 were too strong for @entity16 , and they went ahead in the 34th minute when @entity113 scored from @entity36 's cross			1
and the duo combined again seven minutes later when @entity113 scored with a clever back - header from @entity36 's cross			0
@entity113 completed his hat - trick early in the second half when he tapped in @entity127 's cutback			1
the home side pulled a goal back when @entity130 headed in @entity132 's corner			0
but @entity133 soon restored the three - goal advantage with a brilliant drive from outside the penalty area			0
and @entity113 curled home his fourth and @entity15 's fifth in injury time			2
the result leaves @entity141 's side without a point along with @entity143 and @entity144 , who suffered their third straight defeat 1 - 0 at home to @entity148 sunday			0
in sunday 's other @entity6 match , @entity149 beat @entity151 2 - 1 at home with two goals from striker @entity153 .			1
