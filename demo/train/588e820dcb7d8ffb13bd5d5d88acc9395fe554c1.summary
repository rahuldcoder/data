-- @entity3 's @entity2 title defense came to an embarrassing end with a dramatic 3 - 2 defeat by @entity7 footballing minnows @entity8 on thursday			1
the four - time champions followed 2006 runners - up @entity10 in making a first - round exit despite a frantic finale in which they had a goal disallowed			2
it is the first time that both finalists from the previous tournament have departed at such an early stage of soccer 's biggest event , and only the fourth occasion that the titleholders crashed out at the opening hurdle			1
@entity10 were the last champions to exit in the first round in 2002 , following @entity27 in 1966 and @entity3 in 1950 -- having won the 1938 event before @entity29 broke out			2
troubled @entity31 team keeps low profile on return home @entity8 progressed into the last 16 along with @entity34 , who topped @entity36 following a 0 - 0 draw with @entity38			1
the @entity39 were knocked out of the tournament despite finishing unbeaten with three draws -- a sharp contrast to their only other finals appearance in 1982 which ended with three defeats			0
@entity8 3 - 2 @entity3 striker @entity45 scored two goals to help put @entity2 debutants @entity8 into the second round with a famous victory in @entity50			1
the striker put his side ahead in the 25th minute with a smart finish after @entity3 's @entity53 gave the ball away to @entity55 , who plays for @entity57 club @entity56			0
he made it 2 - 0 with 17 minutes to play after again being set up by @entity55 , but @entity3 kept their hopes alive when @entity60 bundled in an 81st - minute goal after a shot by substitute @entity63 was only parried			1
@entity63 thought he had equalized with five minutes to play , but his effort was ruled offside in a tight decision			0
@entity67 had suffered a gaping wound in his knee just before halftime after a challenge by @entity72 , but soldiered on until just before the end for the @entity74			0
his 86th - replacement @entity75 scored with his first touch of the ball when he coolly lifted the ball over onrushing goalkeeper @entity79 , who was again deputizing for injured first - choice @entity80			0
@entity63 , who had a shot cleared off the line by @entity83 in the 66th minute , finally got his reward in time added on with a sublime chip over goalkeeper @entity87			0
but it was too late for @entity3 , whose coach @entity89 suffered an ignominious defeat after the highs of 2006 when he led his side to victory in a penalty shootout in the final against @entity10			2
" i take full responsibility			0
there are no excuses because when a team comes to something as important as tonight 's game with terror in their legs , their heads and their hearts , and they do n't manage to express themselves , it means that the coach has n't prepared them in the right way from a psychological , technical and physical perspective , " @entity89 said , reported @entity111			0
@entity34 0 - 0 @entity38 @entity34 made up for a first - round exit four years ago with a comfortable draw against @entity38 in @entity114			1
the @entity115 knew a point would be enough to progress following an opening 1 - 1 draw with @entity3 and a 2 - 0 victory over @entity8			1
the @entity39 needed to secure their first ever victory at the @entity2 , but struggled to create clear - cut chances in a match of few opportunities			0
@entity34 coach revamped @entity125 his forward line - up with @entity127 replaced by @entity128 , but his players found @entity38 's stubborn three - man defense as difficult to break down as the @entity131 and @entity74 had previously			1
@entity34 will play the runners - up in @entity133 on tuesday , while @entity8 will play that pool 's winners the day before .			2

@entity3 knocked out of the @entity2 after 3 - 2 defeat by @entity8 in final @entity36 match
