@entity1 gov. @entity0 on saturday declared a state of emergency and implemented a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew in @entity4 , where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager sparked a week of protests and sporadic looting			1
" i 'm committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail , " @entity0 said at a community meeting			1
" if we 're going to achieve justice , we first must have and maintain peace			1
" but the meeting at a local church at times was tumultuous			2
people repeatedly interrupted @entity0 , shouting , " you need to charge the police with murder ! " and " we want justice ! " and some residents said law enforcement officers had instigated the violence with their military - like tactics			1
state highway patrol capt. @entity29 , in charge of security for the town , praised local citizens who tried to stop the looting of several businesses early saturday			1
he said law enforcement would not be heavy - handed in enforcing the curfew			1
" we wo n't enforce it with trucks , we wo n't enforce it with tear gas , " he said			1
but at least one resident was skeptical about whether the curfew would work			1
" it 's an intimidation thing			2
and you 're basically suppressing people who still have questions that need answers , " said @entity45 , who has joined protests throughout the week			2
" you have people who -- at this point -- do not care what authorities say right now			2
" @entity56 killed a week ago @entity4 , a town of about 22,000 people near @entity59 , entered the national consciousness on august 9 when a white police officer , identified as @entity62 , shot and killed and @entity56 , 18 , on a city street during the middle of the day			1
accounts of what happened vary widely			2
police said @entity56 struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon			2
several witnesses said @entity56 raised his hands and was not attacking the officer			0
since then , @entity4 has become a tinder box , with regular street protests , an influx of heavily armed law enforcement officers and intense media coverage			1
a new development in the investigation popped up saturday when a @entity56 family lawyer , @entity80 , said that @entity81 will conduct a second autopsy on the the teenager 's body			0
@entity81 is a high - profile pathologist who testified in the @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 trials			0
early saturday morning , before sunrise , a fragile peace was shattered when looters again targeted neighborhood businesses while law enforcement in riot gear largely looked on without intervening			0
some protesters tried to stop the looting , at times standing in front of one convenience store and preventing others from doing more damage			0
police , criticized days earlier for being too aggressive with protesters , now drew the ire of merchants who told @entity106 they were n't doing enough			1
" you still have a job to do now , and now you 're not doing your job , " @entity107 said of police after thieves broke into her beauty supply shop in the @entity59 suburb and made off with bags of hair extensions worth hundreds of dollars			0
at noon saturday -- the hour that police say @entity62 shot @entity56 a week earlier -- protesters outside the police station silently raised their arms into the air , mimicking @entity56 's purported actions right before he died			0
civil rights leader @entity123 joined loud but peaceful crowds that marched in the street carrying signs saying " @entity128 is our son " and " the whole world is watching @entity4			1
" they chanted " hands up , do n't shoot " and " hey hey , ho ho , killer cops have got to go			2
" looting earlier in the day the looting began at the @entity135 and liquor store , which has become part of the case			0
minutes before @entity56 was shot , police say , a man fitting his description allegedly stole cigars and roughed up a store clerk as surveillance cameras recorded			0
@entity4 police released surveillance video of that robbery on friday , but then emphasized that @entity62 stopped @entity56 not because of the theft , but because @entity56 and a friend were " walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic			1
" release of the video on friday angered some , who say police were using it to distract from @entity56 's killing and make him look bad			0
as protesters took to the streets early saturday , more than two dozen people blocked off the convenience store with cars			0
police with riot gear , tactical rifles and armored vehicles were nearby , commanding them through loudspeakers to free it up			0
instead , bottles flew , mayhem erupted , and looters ransacked the store , which the owner had boarded up			0
it was the first of at least three stores raided			0
