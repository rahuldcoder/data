-- president @entity1 signed legislation friday that will overhaul the @entity4 patent system for the first time since 1952			1
" we have to do everything we can to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit wherever we find it , " @entity1 said at a signing ceremony at a high school in @entity8 , @entity9			0
this measure " cuts away the red tape that slows down our inventors and entrepreneurs			0
" @entity1 used the occasion to promote his $ 447 billion jobs plan , calling patent reform a " part of our ( larger ) agenda for making us competitive over the long term			2
" among other things , the measure , dubbed the @entity24 , will transition the country to a " first - to - file " system , instead of the current " first - to - invent " approach			1
issuing patents to the first person or company to file will help provide clarity in the patent - granting process , the @entity30 says			2
it will also prevent inventors from coming out of the woodwork to challenge pending patents			0
the first - to - file system is the predominant method used by the vast majority of industrialized countries throughout the world			1
the measure also will help provide adequate funding to the overwhelmed patent office by allowing it to set and keep its own fees			1
currently , all patent - filing fees are sent to @entity51 , and the patent office is allocated a set amount that is unrelated to how many patent applications are filed in a given year			1
@entity51 will continue to allocate funds to the patent office , but any fees that the office collects in excess of its allocation would be placed in escrow			1
the patent office will then need to appeal to @entity51 to release that money , allowing @entity51 to maintain a certain level of oversight			1
the patent office currently examines roughly 500,000 applications every year			2
underfunding has led to a 700,000 - patent backlog and a three - year waiting period for the average patent to receive final approval			0
finally , the bill will create a post-grant review process intended to clear up legal battles before they start			0
the measure allows inventors or companies to contest the validity of a patent for nine months after it is issued			0
the patent office will then go back and review the case			2
the idea is to keep more expensive , lengthy patent fights out of the courts			0
@entity0 's @entity82 and @entity83 contributed to this report			0
