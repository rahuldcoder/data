none of the accused in the case has entered a plea and it 's unclear whether they have legal counsel			0

that 's my honest opinion			0
" @entity6 said he and @entity13 , 77 , attended college together 50 years ago			0
@entity6 said he spent a lot of time with the family because his wife had taught piano to two family members			2
" they were in and out of our home quite a bit , and there was absolutely never any indication of abuse , " he said			1
the employer of one of the suspects said , " everybody is still in shock ... disbelief , " as news of the arrests spread through communities where several of the suspects live in western @entity30			0
" he was a good medic , " @entity78 said of @entity79 , who has been employed at @entity80 since 2006			0
@entity9 has been suspended , @entity78 said , and further action may be taken at the next board meeting			1

we suspend their priesthoods , " @entity142 said , referring to a church designation for male members			0
" if this goes to trial and they are convicted , then they will be what we call silenced , and they can no longer represent the church in any way , " @entity142 said			0
the @entity109 is an offshoot of the modern - day @entity166			1
it split off from the @entity169 church in the 1800s , and in 2000 changed its name to @entity109 from the @entity109			1
