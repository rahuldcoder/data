-- @entity2 's story ought to be uncommon , but in post-earthquake @entity4 , it 's not			1
all she has left of her previous life are a stack of photographs and a few other things scavenged off the rubble of the building she called a home			2
when the catastrophe struck , as the @entity4 say , her house tumbled , along with many others that dotted the hillside in the @entity20 neighborhood of @entity21 her husband of nine years , @entity22 , was crushed under concrete			1
she lived in a camp for a while but returned to where she belonged			0
now she has a tin shack and memories -- photographs carefully tucked away in loose , laminated photo album pages of herself and @entity22			0
@entity32 , in a suit			0
she , in a much finer dress than the black sleeveless top and printed skirt she has on now			0
some people tell her she should get rid of the pictures			0
what good are they now ? they bring the kind of sadness that seems almost pointless to dwell on			0
life has to go on for @entity2			1
she has to survive , if not for herself , then for her 15 - year - old daughter			0
sadly , @entity4 have grown used to seeing earthquake rubble and the makeshift camps that sprang up after that fateful day in january 2010			1
the @entity47 , @entity4 officials and private aid agencies have said that @entity4 has made strides in the two years since the quake			1
but few deny that recovery has been painfully slow			2
all you have to do is look at @entity54			0
and she might be considered one of the lucky ones			0
she has a " home , " however modest			2
the @entity47 estimated the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake affected nearly 3 million people and killed about 220,000			1
more than 1.5 million people were left homeless in a country that was already the poorest in the @entity63 and wracked by crisis			1
consider that 70 % of @entity4 did not have stable jobs before the quake and there were only 5.9 doctors per 10,000 residents			1
two years later , almost as many @entity4 are still unemployed			1
@entity70 still clutters the capital and other places			0
about half the rubble , the equivalent of five football stadiums full , has been removed , according to the @entity47			2
@entity76 : how to help about half a million people are still homeless			1
many still live in tents in the shadows of the collapsed presidential palace , perhaps the most visible symbol of @entity4 's misery			1
" you ca n't stay on the streets , " @entity2 said			1
" if that 's what you have , you have to rebuild			2
" she is not alone in her frustration			0
thousands of @entity4 marched wednesday through @entity20 to the @entity91 building to demand a reform of land laws so they can be freed to build homes , said @entity95 , coordinator of the grass - roots campaign funded by @entity97			1
" the rebuilding process is mostly led by the foreigners , " she said			0
" there is no national plan			0
the @entity4 state does not have the will			1
" @entity105 , the former pop star who was elected president last year partly because he presented a fresh face in @entity4 politics , campaigned on a pledge to fix @entity4			1
but it took him months to even form a government and he recently said that motivating people to move in the nation 's " culture of immobilism " has been a challenge			2
@entity0 photos : @entity4 's children , two years later standing recently on a site where he said more than 600 families had been living in tents until just days ago , @entity105 said the government was able to relocate them in housing			1
the project , he said , cost $ 9 million because damaged homes had to be either repaired or reconstructed			2
he acknowledged that many thousands are still waiting			0
" but it 's about sending the signal , " he told @entity0 's @entity128			2
" it 's not about having the magic stick and making the problem disappear in one day			2
if you plant a tree today , in order to enjoy the shadow , you have to wait five years			0
so changing @entity4 is going to take time and healing the wounds is going to take time			1
" perhaps that signal can be seen at the tent city that sprang up on the slopes around the tony @entity143			0
@entity144 , director of @entity146 's aid agency @entity145 , said the number of people living there has dwindled from a high of 60,000 to 20,000			1
the focus , he said , has shifted from emergency care for the people in the camp to relocating them			0
the agency has been helping uncover a buried neighborhood nearby			0
" what we 've done in the past year is we 've transitioned all our services from the camp into the neighborhood , " he said			0
" so for right now all of our medical clinics , they 're operating in the neighborhood			0
they 're close enough to camp that the people in the camp can access them , but really they 're community clinics at this point			0
" trapped in @entity4 : a return to site of catastrophe it 's not just about providing services but also how to make the best use of money			1
@entity95 said @entity4 are demanding transparency in a land enveloped by corruption			1
again , @entity105 acknowledged it will be " very difficult			0
" " i believe the real devil in @entity4 can only stop when we change our mentality , our way of doing things , " he said			1
after the earthquake , @entity4 became a darling of the international community			1
@entity47 pledged money and policymakers vowed that out of tragedy would come a new beginning			0
but two years on , @entity4 are asking : where did all that money go ? a key issue has been the disbursal of the foreign aid that was pledged for reconstruction			1
the @entity47 said this week that almost 53 % of the $ 4.5 billion the international community pledged for reconstruction in 2010 and 2011 had been disbursed			2
however , the @entity202 said its analysis showed that only 10 % of the funds disbursed by the @entity205 , which the center said received nearly 20 % of all donor pledges , have been spent on the ground			0
according to the @entity213 - based research organization , the " @entity209 has approved over $ 3 billion in projects , yet most have not even begun			0
and only 2.4 % of @entity215 government contracts went directly to @entity4 firms , while @entity217 relied on @entity213 area contractors for more than 90 % of their contracts			1
" buried alive together , survivors reunite for first time @entity222 , one of many international charities working in @entity4 , said progress is at a " snail 's pace			1
" " with a new government in place and billions of aid dollars pledged , @entity4 are left asking why there has not been more progress in rebuilding the country , " said @entity222 's country director in @entity4 , @entity228			1
" the second anniversary of the devastating earthquake must be a call to action , " she said			2
" despite the apparent slowness of reconstruction , this remains an opportunity for @entity243 s political and economic elite to address the chronic poverty and inequality that has plagued the country since independence			2
" @entity2 got tired of waiting for aid agencies to help her			1
it 's difficult , she said , to live like this			2
but she thought she might as well return to the slopes of @entity255 , dotted with crumbled structures and vacant spots			0
at least it was home			0
@entity0 's @entity128 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 lost her home and husband in the 2010 earthquake
she is now living in the remnants of her home
but about half a million @entity4 are still in camps
the country 's new president acknowledges recovery will take time
