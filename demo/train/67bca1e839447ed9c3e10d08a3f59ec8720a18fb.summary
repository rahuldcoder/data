-- by day , he dons a white lab coat			2
at the weekend , he terrorizes opposition teams in his bright red outfit			0
even @entity5 struggles to define himself			1
on his @entity7 biography , he asks : " rugby player / research officer or is it the other way around ? " in one walk of life , he is trying to help rid the world of disease as he works on new antibiotics at a @entity16 university			1
in another , he is one of the stars of the rugby sevens circuit , despite coming from a country best known for producing long - distance runners			1
for all his prowess both on and off the field , his nickname perhaps lacks imagination -- " @entity27 " -- although at 6 foot 6 inches it must be said he lives up to the billing			0
while he has bedeviled opposition defenses on the @entity31 circuit , it is his less heralded work behind closed doors at @entity34 that is of the greater consequence			1
broadly , his studies come under the banner of chemistry and math , but more specifically it is a research project on antibiotics			1
" it 's a massive project at the university , " @entity5 explains			1
" we 're all trying to foresee antibiotics and developing resistance , so we 're looking into developing new drugs			2
" it 's more to do with bacterial infections and it 's a very slow and steady process			2
" the 31 - year - old says the research is funded by @entity16 pharmaceutical multinational @entity52 , which trials the compounds and active ingredients that the chemists provide			1
" there 's been some positive results but it 's a long process , " he says			1
" the potential to do good things for human beings is amazing			0
it 's an interesting project to be a part of			2
" it may not seem likely on the surface but his rugby and chemistry are intertwined , even though most sevens specialists do n't have quite the same academic achievements on their cvs			1
it was while training at @entity34 with the @entity75 national team three years ago that he was spotted by rugby officials at the training facility			1
they were interested in his rugby skills as well as his chemistry qualities			2
so he applied for a place , was accepted and moved to the southwest city in february 2012			0
he struggled initially to adapt to rugby life in a wintery @entity87 , being used to warmer climes on the sevens circuit			1
" one weekend i was playing in the sunshine of @entity91 or in a @entity92 winter , and next it was a mud bath in @entity94			0
@entity87 in february was a shock but i got used to it and love it			0
" his time in the city is coming to a close , with his thesis on examining tablets that are fed to fight bacteria drawing to its conclusion			2
it is something he has juggled alongside his rugby commitments but later this year the sevens will once again become the major focus as he builds towards the 2014 @entity110 and , bigger yet , sevens ' debut at the @entity113 in @entity114 in 2016			1
@entity115 was not an obvious sporting choice for @entity5 , who grew up in @entity117 in the @entity118 , a region renowned for producing @entity75 's greatest long - distance runners			1
many top athletes , such as double @entity113 and world champion @entity121 , go there to train each winter			0
" growing up there , all you saw were long - distance runners , a lot of them , " he says			1
" because of our history , everyone expects sportsmen from @entity75 to be runners			1
" the long runs were never @entity5 's forte			1
a sprinter in his youth , unlike most of his peers , he wanted to run fast but only over short distances			0
the other sporting passion was football , played out in often dust - bowl conditions on the dry pitches of the @entity143 nation			2
@entity115 was a mere afterthought			0
" i think i was 16 or 17 when i first played at high school , " he recalls			0
" i was n't interested -- i 'd never really seen anyone play -- it was just a sport i had to try			0
i braced myself for it at first but , once i got used to the physicality of it , everything else was fine			0
" it was so confusing with the rules when i first started			0
i really remember in my first game just concentrating on throwing the ball backwards			0
but i think i had a good first game as i just wanted to run			0
" he has kept on running to good effect ever since , scoring more than 130 tries in the international format for his country and starring in a series of victories against some of the true powerhouses of the sport			0
in fact , his family has produced three rugby stars -- @entity5 's brothers @entity169 and @entity171 also play for @entity75			1
@entity169 is his country 's top try scorer and is third on the @entity31 ' all - time list with 183 ahead of the next leg in @entity175 next month			1
the @entity75 arguably first made a global name for themselves with their on and off - field theatrics -- they often perform a dance after competitions -- which earned them the tag of " everyone 's second favorite team			1
" " i think we 're quite different as a team , we love our running rugby , it 's quite instinctive and everyone tends to love it , " @entity5 says			1
" we 've also come a long way in the sport and have been getting some good results			0
" the next step is for greater consistency in their results against the top teams , plus to have @entity110 and @entity113 aspirations			0
a proposal has been lodged to host a leg of the @entity199 but it has not been helped by ongoing security fears in @entity201 following last year 's terrorist attack on the capital 's @entity204 shopping mall , when 72 people were killed			2
at the time , @entity5 was playing with his compatriots and visiting teams from abroad on the other side of the city in the @entity211			2
" it was almost the end of the day when we first heard news of what was happening , " he recalls			0
" by the time we got back to our hotel , we only then properly heard the news			0
we 've just been running up and down a rugby field and something this terrible had been happening			2
" thankfully , i did n't have any close friends or family in there			0
i knew of one guy who was there hiding in the basement			0
he was stuck in there for 12 hours but got out okay			0
can you imagine going through that ? " the impact on the country was immediate			0
tourism is undoubtedly down and , in terms of rugby spectators , it dropped from 20,000 for the first day to a mere 2,000 -- throwing doubt over a potential place on the sevens calendar			1
" i can understand that as teams going to another place need to feel safe , that is @entity241 , " @entity5 says			2
with rugby and chemistry , @entity5 -- who was named an @entity31 anti-doping ambassador in 2010 -- has set his sights on making the world a safer place			1
his work in science will go on , whether that 's in the @entity16 or @entity75 when his research project ends			1
as for his rugby playing , he has set his sights on the @entity253 after which , if fit and selected , he looks set to end his remarkable sevens journey			2
watch : the secrets to creating the world 's best runners in @entity75			1

@entity5 is the star turn in @entity75 's rugby sevens team
but in his day *job* he works on research into improving antibiotics to fight disease
@entity5 hails from the @entity118 , an area renowned for long - distance running not rugby
