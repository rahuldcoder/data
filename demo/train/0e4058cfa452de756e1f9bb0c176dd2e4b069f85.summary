-- the evidence that people are getting tired of @entity3 continues to pile up			1
the latest bad news comes from @entity6 president @entity5 , who in an interview with @entity8 admitted that interest in @entity3 is " perhaps slightly on the wane again			1
" although @entity6 will continue to offer 3 - d in its handheld gaming devices , it wo n't be a major selling point , says @entity5 : " so , now we 've created the @entity17 and @entity16 and also have some games out there that are really using that @entity3 effect that we can see , from my point of view , that it 's an important element			1
but as human beings are this kind of surprise effect wears off quickly , and just [ having ] this @entity3 stereoscopic effect is n't going to keep people excited			1
" @entity5 's view that @entity3 is " slightly on the wane " seems like an understatement			2
you need n't look far for other signs that @entity3 is failing			0
although studios released 19 more @entity3 movies in 2011 than the year before , @entity3 box office revenue fell by 18 % in the @entity37 , or about $ 400 million , according to the @entity38			1
last month , @entity3 attendance hit a record low for the opening weekend of @entity42 's " brave , " with just 32 % of revenues coming from @entity3 , says the @entity44			2
while " @entity49 " fared better , with a little more than half of sales coming from @entity3 tickets , it 's not even close to the 83 % 3 - d revenue that " @entity51 " enjoyed in december 2009			1
the days where you absolutely had to see a hit movie in @entity3 are over			0
the @entity55 situation is n't much better			0
sales of 3 - d televisions are on the rise in the @entity37 according to the @entity59 , but only 14 % of consumers who might buy a tv in the next six months say @entity3 is a " must - have " feature			1
most people just think of it as future - proofing â € ” something that might be nice to have			0
even @entity67 , the world 's largest tv maker , admits that @entity55 has n't lived up to the hype , and the company is now exalting web - connected smart tvs as its next big source of growth			2
it 's easy to guess why @entity3 is struggling in movies and television sets : people do n't want to be burdened with 3 - d glasses , or worry about eye strain , and pay a premium for the privilege			1
but @entity6 's cooling attitude toward glasses - free @entity3 signals a deeper problem : even once you remove the pesky glasses , the novelty of @entity3 wears off			1
that 's a pretty staggering admission from a company that put the term " @entity3 " in the name of its handheld			0
at least with @entity3 hype deflated , media and tech companies can focus on more important things			0
@entity67 can put more effort into @entity97			0
@entity6 can work on adding more features and new entertainment apps to the @entity17			0
i know this is a stretch , but maybe @entity102 can stop putting out so many bad movies			0
those all seem like better alternatives than fooling your eyes into seeing another dimension			0
this article originally appeared on @entity110 : the 3 - d hype bubble is now completely busted			2
