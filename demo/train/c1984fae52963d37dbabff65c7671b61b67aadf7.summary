first up : southern storms @entity44 : unparalleled , near - epic , heartbreaking			1
those are just some of the words officials are using to describe the severe weather and the impact that it had as it ripped across parts of the southern @entity52 on wednesday			1
we 've been talking about storms in the south for a few days now			1
the devastation that happened on wednesday was immense			1
across six states , more than 270 people were killed			2
governors declaring states of emergency and asking president @entity63 to do the same thing			2
most of the deaths happened in @entity67			2
this video gives you an idea of just how frightening it was to be in parts of that state on wednesday			2
that 's where the @entity77 is located			2
officials say the school was n't hit too badly			2
nnot the case for other parts of the town			2
@entity75 's mayor said , " i do n't know how anyone survived			2
" he added , " we 're used to tornadoes here in @entity75			2
but when you look at the path of destruction ... there 's parts of the city i do n't recognize			0
" no question about it , these storms were strong			1
as it turns out , you 're more likely to get more powerful storms when there are n't a lot in one area			1
yesterday , @entity103 explained the science behind that			0
@entity106 , @entity107 : when you have a bunch of storms that are all banging into each other , you do n't get @entity112 , @entity113 tornadoes			1
when you have a storm all by itself , like we had a couple of them yesterday , here , here , here , here , not battling tops , all by themselves , that 's when you get this type of structure			0
impact your world @entity44 : relief is already on the way			0
at @entity124 , you can out how you can make a difference			0
go to our home page , scroll down to the @entity129 section and click on the " @entity131 " link to learn how you can help			0
what 's the @entity134 ? @entity135 , @entity32 : what 's the word ? as a noun , it means an effort , an action or activity designed to achieve a goal			0
@entity144 that 's the word ! @entity146 @entity44 : the space shuttle endeavour is getting ready to set off on a new endeavor			2
you might notice that the shuttle 's name is spelled differently			2
that 's because it 's named after a @entity7 ship , not after the word			1
@entity156 is scheduled to launch later today			1
the mission to the international space station will be commanded by @entity159			0
his wife will be at the @entity6 to watch the liftoff			0
that 's newsworthy , because his wife is @entity52 representative @entity163 , who was the victim of a shooting less than four months ago			1
the two - week mission is the last one for @entity156			1
as it gets ready to take its last flight , @entity166 looks back at the first time @entity156 lifted off			1
( begin video ) @entity166 , @entity172 : @entity156 , the newest of the orbiters , might never have been built if not for a terrible accident			1
in the aftermath of the loss of @entity178 in 1986 , president @entity175 promised the disaster would not stop the journey outward			0
former @entity52 president @entity175 : we will continue our quest in space			1
there will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews			2
@entity188 : a year and a half later , @entity189 authorized the construction of the new , nearly $ 2 billion space plane			0
@entity156 's first flight , 1992			1
@entity193 @entity193 announcer : liftoff of the maiden voyage of @entity156 ... @entity188 : this will be its 25th and final flight			1
along its journey , @entity156 made numerous construction trips to the international space station and handled the first @entity203 repair mission			1
@entity204 , the first educator in space , flew on @entity156			1
@entity204 was the back - up to teacher - in - space @entity207 , who died on @entity178			2
the shuttle fleet has had both a tragic and triumphant past			2
and for thirty years , has been @entity52 's signature flying machine			1
@entity212 @entity211 , endeavour astronaut : it 's got a glass cockpit			0
it has a robot arm			0
it can fly to the @entity203 or the station			0
it can land anywhere on the planet that has a runway			0
it is an amazing piece of equipment on any scale			0
@entity188 : when @entity156 returns from its final flight , commander @entity159 jokes , there wo n't be anything missing			1
@entity159 , endeavour commander : you know , when you fly an airplane to the boneyard out in the desert , they say do n't take anything off of it			0
you get the brief ahead of time			0
i 'll do the same thing with my crew : " you got to leave , make sure it all stays intact for the museum			0
" we 're not gon na be signing our name on anything			0
@entity188 : perhaps just the guest book at the @entity252 , where @entity156 will be placed in retirement			1
@entity166 , @entity0 , at the @entity6 in @entity254			1
( @entity255 ) @entity256 @entity257 , @entity32 : today 's @entity256 goes out to mrs. @entity259 's 7ups classes at @entity260 in @entity261			0
@entity262 , @entity263 ! where is today 's royal wedding taking place ? you know what to do ! is it in : a ) @entity270 , b ) @entity271 , c ) @entity273 or @entity274 ) @entity275 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! prince @entity277 and @entity278 are exchanging vows at @entity271			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity283 @entity44 : @entity271 is a popular choice for royal weddings			0
that 's where @entity287 was married 63 years ago			0
before @entity277 and @entity278 set foot in the @entity271 this morning , though , people were lining up on the streets of @entity292 hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple on their way to @entity296			0
at @entity124 , you 'll find @entity0 's @entity298			1
check out the guest list , the seating chart for the @entity301 , the royal wedding family tree			0
there 's been a ton of media focus on the wedding , especially here in the @entity52 , a country that fought for its independence from @entity310			1
@entity311 looks at how a revolution eventually gave way to a special relationship between the two nations			1
( begin video ) @entity316 , historian , @entity318 : it 's that summer of ' 39 that you see the beginning of the birth of this special relationship that 's been with us ever since			1
@entity311 , @entity0 anchor : at the time , the spotlight on another royal couple : @entity328 and @entity287			1
the special relationship with the @entity52 begins with letters between the king and president @entity332			1
and soon after , a visit ; the first time a reigning @entity7 monarch tours the @entity52 @entity335 : this visit then comes at a very critical moment			1
@entity332 was looking for a way to strengthen @entity52 bonds with @entity310			1
especially the bonds between the @entity52 people and the @entity7 people			1
@entity344 : not long after , @entity345 is the first to use the phrase " special relationship , " as the two countries fight together during @entity349 a sentiment often repeated by other prime ministers and presidents throughout the years			1
@entity353 , former british prime minister : i come in friendship to renew for new times our special relationship			1
@entity344 : why is that relationship so special ? @entity360 : it did n't start very well 225 years ago when you kicked the @entity7 out			1
but i think this shared purpose , the same values of liberty , democracy , responsibility to each other , fairness			0
@entity344 : yet , the special relationship has not been without strains			1
the @entity52 would not support @entity310 during the 1956 @entity373 crisis , and @entity310 refused to support the @entity52 during the @entity374			1
@entity360 : we can have treaties that are broken , but this relationship , it seems to me , is unbreakable , because it is based on something more than just sort of an assessment of your best interests			2
@entity344 : close ties between the two countries often correspond with the bonds of friendship between the leaders : prime minister @entity390 and president @entity391 fighting the @entity392			0
prime minister @entity393 and president @entity175 , united during the fall of the @entity396			0
but prime minister @entity398 's support of president @entity400 's decision to invade @entity401 was not without consequences			0
@entity335 : this became very , very unpopular , of course , among the @entity7 public			1
and @entity398 paid a price for this politically and is still paying a price for this to this day			0
@entity344 : but as the two countries move forward , former prime minister @entity353 takes an optimistic view			0
@entity360 : despite all the different problems that will arise , this relationship will endure and , perhaps , strengthen in the years to come			2
( @entity255 ) before we go @entity44 : before we go , kids hate being told to clean up their toys			0
but for the little guy in this @entity420 video , it 's a chance to show off his skills			0
first shot , kind of impressive			0
keep in mind , he 's only 18 months old			0
he lines up the 2nd kick			0
@entity426 ! can he go a perfect 3 for 3 ? you bet he can			0
somebody better sign him up ! turns out , somebody did ! his granddad 's old soccer team			0
signing a toddler to a ten - year contract ? goodbye @entity44 : we bet grandpa got a real kick out of that			0
as for the mini-midfielder , if he ever throws a tantrum , i guess his parents just have to give him a red card since there are no time outs in soccer			0
that 's gon na run out the clock on today 's show			0
we 'll see you again on monday .			0
