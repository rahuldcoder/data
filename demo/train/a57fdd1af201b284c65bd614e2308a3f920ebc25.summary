@entity0 -- inside @entity4 's adobe - colored confines , @entity2 works furiously to help the dozens of @entity7 - speaking patients who queue up weekly seeking help registering for @entity10			1
he logs into @entity11 , the local insurance exchange , and his fingers click rapidly on the computer keys as he enters information into page after page while translating questions and answers into @entity7 for families whose members often each have a different immigration status			2
" si , " he tells them , the son who was born here qualifies for coverage under @entity10			2
no , the @entity28 - born mom who has a green card and has been here for only two years , will not qualify for @entity31 until she has been in the @entity32 five years			0
for hours he sorts through and translates the complicated questions and answers			0
all of the information disappears			0
then he begs for patience and begins the process anew			0
welcome to @entity10 en @entity7			1
the @entity41 administration is banking on the support of the @entity44 community , with its large numbers of young and uninsured , to help make the president 's signature health care reform law a success			1
" the population we serve is the most difficult , " @entity49 said , adding that it often takes several hours and a couple of visits to get an entire family signed up because of technical difficulties and the complexities of enrolling families of mixed immigration status			0
@entity49 's challenges echo problems faced nationally by @entity7 speakers when they try to enroll in the signature @entity41 administration program designed to serve as a safety net for millions of uninsured @entity32			1
efforts to register @entity7 speakers are further complicated by technical problems on @entity10 - related websites , worries that information might be used for deportation purposes , problems verifying income , and a digital divide among those who might not have ready access to a computer said @entity77 , associate director of @entity79 's @entity78			1
" enrollment is happening , but it 's been a very slow process for a number of reasons , " @entity77 said			0
" latinos were uninformed and there 's a mistrust issue because they are mistrustful of government and there was so much information out there in the media they did n't know what they should believe			2
" who 's signing up for @entity10 ? support among the @entity44 community is critical to the @entity41 administration 's efforts			1
roughly half of the nation 's @entity101 are under the age of 26 and they are in a good position to pay into insurance pools , while being less likely , because of their relative youth , to draw from them , leaving premium funds available to help pay for health care for older , sicker participants			0
@entity101 account for roughly 17 % of the population , but they make up 32 % of the country 's uninsured who are n't elderly , according to a report by the @entity116 , an organization which conducts health policy research			0
" disproportionately we are being counted on to sustain this program , " said @entity118 , executive director of the @entity119 , a nonpartisan , nonprofit grassroots @entity44 advocacy organization			2
" we are a heavy chunk of the folks who are being expected to sign up			0
" but when @entity7 speakers want to sign up for @entity10 in their own language , they face problems			1
on www.cuidadodesalud.gov , the @entity7 language version of @entity130 , sometimes links led to dead ends or pages in @entity134			2
in other instances , some words and phrases are literal translations from @entity134 to @entity7 , which health advocates in the @entity44 community say makes the site difficult to understand			1
" to put up a website that is only cosmetic it 's disrespectful of this administration , " @entity118 said			0
" if you 're going to have a website , have it work , for the love of @entity149			0
" after media reports and questions by @entity1 , the @entity150 , which oversees both the sites , has addressed a number of hyperlink - related problems on the website			0
the @entity7 language site did not launch until december 6 -- a full two months late and after its @entity134 language counterpart debuted			1
this means @entity7 speakers have a much shorter window to browse online to make health care choices before the march 31 deadline for enrollment			1
unlike their @entity134 speaking counterparts , @entity7 speakers still can not shop for insurance plans on the website			1
" it is very disappointing that it is taking so long to get this critical element on the @entity7 website , " @entity77 said			1
@entity32 drops contractor for work on @entity10 website despite calls among some @entity44 advocacy groups to extend that deadline given the @entity7 website 's delayed launch and inability to purchase plans online , @entity150 officials said they are unaware of any plans to do so			1
some @entity44 advocacy groups say the @entity41 administration has given their community short shrift in its health care rollout @entity150 decided to delay enrollment on @entity191 until they fixed the massive technical glitches on the problem - plagued @entity134 version , agency officials said			1
" to make sure that @entity7 - speaking consumers have the best possible consumer experience , we launched the consumer tools on @entity191 as we made upgrades to the site , " @entity150 spokesman @entity194 said in a statement			1
" the technical components of both websites go hand - in - hand and we were mindful that launching both websites simultaneously may possibly have exacerbated the problems			0
the soft launch has allowed us to identify areas of concerns early and ensure the best product possible			0
" @entity150 also points out that @entity7 - speakers can enroll on the phone with bilingual staffers			2
since october 1 , there have been more than 330,000 @entity7 calls , which represents 4 % of overall call volume , according to the agency			2
@entity7 speakers can also fill out a paper application in that language			1
the administration is also relying heavily on bilingual specialists at community organizations , libraries and local health centers to help get people signed up			2
the administration says it does not yet have figures on the number @entity7 speakers who have enrolled in @entity10 thus far or a breakdown of those enrollments by state			1
however , recent enrollment figures of the overall population show that only one in four young adults between the ages of 18 and 34 have signed up for insurance plans under @entity10			2
@entity235 , @entity236 , and @entity237 -- states with some of the nation 's biggest @entity7 speaking populations -- show similar figures			0
the administration reiterated on the website and to community assistants who help @entity7 - speakers enroll that " information provided by applicants or beneficiaries wo n't be used for immigration enforcement purposes			1
" and the @entity41 administration is redoubling efforts to boost @entity44 enrollment			1
" in my opinion the @entity10 is the single most life - saving act this country has had , " @entity252 , a physician in @entity253 , @entity237 , stressed in a recent telephone news conference organized by the @entity255			0
others are taking a wait and see approach			2
" the good news is @entity263 are being enrolled , " @entity77 said			0
" not at the rate we would like to see			0
let 's see what happens from now to march 31			0
" @entity255 awards @entity130 contract			0

@entity7 speakers face extra challenges signing up for @entity10
technical glitches on @entity7 site , government mistrust , digital divide to blame
@entity41 administration hoping for high @entity44 enrollment
*hispanic* community advocates taking wait and see approach on @entity10 success
