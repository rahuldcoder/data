if you have not been following the case of @entity3 , you should be			1
@entity3 is the @entity5 florist who has been sued for living out her @entity8 beliefs			1
in 2013 , a long - time friend and customer came to her flower shop and asked her to provide flowers for his gay wedding			1
@entity3 had known this man and had done business with him for about nine years			1
nevertheless , she told him that she could not participate in his wedding " because of my relationship with @entity19			2
" the man 's partner subsequently spread the word via social media			2
as a result , the attorney general of @entity5 sued @entity3 for violating the state 's anti-discrimination law			1
the two men also sued her in their personal capacity and were represented by the @entity30			2
as a result of these lawsuits , @entity3 stands to lose her business , her home , and her personal savings			1
her whole life hangs in the balance with this case			2
yesterday , a @entity5 judge issued a summary judgment that went against her			1
@entity3 's legal team put out this statement explaining what this means : a state judge ruled wednesday that @entity5 floral artist and grandmother @entity3 must provide full support for wedding ceremonies that are contrary to her faith			1
the court also ruled recently that both the state and the same - sex couple , who each filed lawsuits against her , may collect damages and attorneys fees not only from her business , but from @entity3 personally			1
that means the 70 - year - old grandmother may not only lose her business , but also her home and savings because she lives her life and operates her business according to her beliefs			2
" the message of these rulings is unmistakable : the government will bring about your personal and professional ruin if you do n't help celebrate same - sex marriage , " said @entity68 , senior counsel for @entity69 , who argued before the court in december			1
the decision against @entity3 sets a dreadful precedent against our first freedom in the @entity81 : religious liberty			1
the court says that she is free to believe what she wants , but not to practice her religious beliefs			0
the court has ruled that if she wants to run a business in the state of @entity5 , she must defy her conscience and participate in same - sex weddings			1
if she does not , then the full coercive power of the state -- as well as civil liability -- will be brought against her			0
keep in mind that @entity3 does not refuse service to gay people			1
indeed she had been selling flowers to this gay couple for nine years			2
she has also employed gay people in her flower shop			0
she had a friendship with the man suing her and cared for him personally and wished for her relationship with him to continue			0
she simply could not defy her conscience and lend her creative talent to help celebrate what her faith says she can not celebrate			0
she had no idea that staying true to her faith would end up threatening her entire livelihood and savings			0
we are witnessing a shift in our society -- a shift which inevitably leads to @entity8 being treated as pariahs at every level of our national life			0
@entity116 's @entity8 views on marriage got him removed from the president 's inauguration			0
@entity121 's support for traditional marriage got him dismissed as ceo of @entity124			0
@entity126 's @entity8 faith got him fired from his position as fire chief of @entity129			0
two bakers in @entity131 had to shutter their business and are now facing bankruptcy for refusing to participate in a gay wedding			2
who will be next ? this summer , the @entity137 will rule on gay marriage , and many observers expect the ruling to be a @entity142 - type legal landmark , perhaps declaring a constitutional right to same - sex marriage			1
the @entity145 may consider again a version of the @entity147 , which would make sexual orientation and gender identity into protected classes			0
this means that what is happening to @entity3 in @entity5 could be happening to @entity8 nationwide in very short order			1
@entity3 's case is nothing less than an egregious violation of our first freedom			2
it is @entity161 saying , " conscience be damned			0
submit to the new sexual orthodoxy or risk losing everything			0
" this is not tolerance			0
this is injustice that flies in the face of this nation 's laws and traditions			0
and if this kind of thing can be done to a 70 - year - old grandmother running a small flower shop in rural @entity5 , then it can be done to you			1
no one 's conscience is safe if this precedent becomes the norm .			0
