@entity0 -- fbi director @entity2 says new encryption standards by @entity4 and @entity5 will create " a black hole for law enforcement " that will help sophisticated criminals avoid detection			1
@entity2 is taking up the @entity11 's years - long push to expand federal surveillance law to require tech companies to include a way for law enforcement to get court ordered access to data on new devices			1
" the law has n't kept pace with technology , " @entity2 said in remarks at the @entity21			1
" this disconnect has created a significant public safety problem			2

" related - @entity38 pedophiles from cops @entity2 says he understands privacy concerns in the wake of the disclosures of @entity44 surveillance by former contractor @entity45			1
he says the government 's ability to do surveillance and what it does access is overstated			2
@entity4 and @entity5 have started selling new operating systems for cellphones that they explicitly market as encrypted beyond the reach of law enforcement			1
even with a court order the company can not let law enforcement get into the devices , unless the data is uploaded to cloud computers			0
" but uploading to the cloud does n't include all of the stored data on a bad guy 's phone , which has the potential to create a black hole for law enforcement			0
and if the bad guys do n't back up their phones routinely or of they opt out of uploading to the cloud , the data will only be found on the encrypted devices			0
" people trying to evade law enforcement are most likely to ensure their data ca n't be accessed , @entity2 said			1
" sophisticated criminals will come to count on these means of evading detection			2
it 's the equivalent of a closet that ca n't be opened			0
a safe that ca n't be cracked			0

fbi director @entity2 is worried that encryption technology by @entity4 and @entity5 could help criminals
