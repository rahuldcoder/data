@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was the most famous high - speed chase of its day			1
the pursuers did n't have flashing blue lights			2
they could n't swing around and cut off the hijacked vehicle			2
but they did n't have to			2
the locomotive general weighed more than 20 tons and was confined to a single iron track between @entity12 , @entity1 , and @entity13 , @entity14			1
its top speed was about 70 miles per hour , it had no brakes , and it eventually ran out of fuel			2
however , " @entity29 , " which occurred 150 years ago thursday , made heroes of @entity21 soldiers and civilians -- who tried to put a critical railroad line out of commission during the @entity25 -- and the @entity27 train crews and troops who pursued them			1
several members of the raiding party were the first to receive the new @entity32			1
the suburban @entity12 town where the chase began and other @entity1 communities along the 80 - mile route this week are commemorating the wild , failed escapade immortalized in two movies			1
" it 's the greatest war story ever told , " said @entity40 , 60 , of @entity12 , as he prepared thursday to enter @entity0 's @entity41 and @entity42 , which houses the general			1
" it 's a classic tale of daring versus persistence			2
" civilian leader @entity47 and his band of raiders boarded the @entity43 in nearby @entity50 , bent on damaging the @entity52 line as well as @entity54 communications as they rushed northward to @entity13			1
" the whole thing was snake - bit from the start , " said @entity56 , author of the 2006 book " stealing the general : the @entity29 and the @entity63			1
" " two raiders overslept and missed the train , and there was bad ( rail ) traffic and weather , " @entity64 said			1
on the morning of april 12 , 1862 , as the @entity43 made a breakfast stop in @entity0 ( present - day @entity0 ) , @entity47 ' men unhooked passenger cars and sped away			2
stunned conductor @entity76 , thinking @entity54 draftees at a camp in @entity0 might have commandeered @entity43 , literally ran after his train			1
he came across a handcar and cranked it until he found a train that could follow the general			1
@entity54 horsemen eventually joined the madcap pursuit			2
as @entity76 kept the heat on and changed trains , @entity47 ' colleagues made two small breaks in the track and cut telegraph wires			2
@entity47 , who thought any pursuit had been stalled , was nearly caught in the town of @entity92 , but continued on to a spot near @entity94 , where the @entity43 ran out of wood and water as the @entity97 closed in -- about seven hours after the caper began			0
that is when he is reported to have said , " every man for himself ! " the raiders jumped off , but were rounded up			1
the cost for taking part in the sabotage attempt was high			0
@entity105 and seven other captured participants were subsequently hanged as spies			0
a dozen others escaped or were exchanged			0
besides @entity43 , the dogged chase involved , in order , pursuing locomotives @entity111 , @entity113 and the @entity97			1
remarkably , the @entity97 also survives			0
its role often is overlooked			0
the locomotive , which operated in reverse during its portion of the chase , is housed at the @entity119			1
" when the @entity97 got in the race , it was a duel between evenly matched locomotives , " @entity64 told @entity2			0
some consider the hijacking of the general as the @entity125 of its time : an attempt to boost morale and throw a little scare into the enemy			0
" it 's not a military battle , " said @entity131 , executive director of the @entity0 museum			0
" this is an ingenious concept of ' let 's go 200 miles behind enemy lines			0
' " in the end , however , @entity47 and his saboteurs did little damage and failed to burn a vital bridge			0
@entity0 , @entity50 and other cities along the chase route , which now parallels @entity144 75 in northern @entity1 , are sponsoring a range of events through the weekend , including tours , music , living histories and the screenings of two movies about the @entity47 raid : @entity154 's silent comedy " @entity43 " ( 1927 ) and @entity156 's " @entity29 " ( 1956 ) , starring @entity155			1
on thursday , the @entity43 was festooned with red , white and blue bunting as museum visitors took photos and learned more about regional railroad history			1
it saw service until the early 1960s			0
most of its parts , including the smokestack , have been replaced or modified			0
the wheels and axle are believed to be original			0
the episode proved the importance of railroads in the war and society , @entity64 said			0
the line is still in operation today , serving as a busy @entity177 freight artery			0
and the chase continues to capture the imagination			2
" it is like the @entity181 , the @entity182 and the @entity183 all rolled into one , " @entity64 said .			0

150 years ago thursday , @entity21 raiders stole a train in @entity1
they were chased by conductor , other crew members
