-- the international development agency promoting female rights -- the news did n't go down too well with many women working in the field			1
after his appointment @entity1 was told that some female ambassadors at the @entity11 were upset that a man had been made head of the agency			1
but he was determined to put their minds at ease			0
" we had lunch with them [ female ambassadors ] and they asked me , ' so , justify this position , ' " remembers @entity1			2
" i spoke and after that they stood and said ' ok , we 're satisfied with that , from today you are an honorary woman			0
' i carry that title well			0
" read : too many mothers still dying a tireless advocate of female rights , @entity1 has had a long career caring for women			1
he qualified as a doctor in 1972 and went on to teach at the @entity34 , in his native @entity35 , before heading @entity35 's @entity36 for the @entity37 and becoming the country 's health minister			2
today , as executive director of the @entity3 , @entity1 , who is also the @entity11 's under - secretary general , is focused on gender equality and reducing poverty , helping hundreds of millions in developing countries			1
some 20 months into his new role , @entity1 says he wants the agency to reach as many women and girls around the world as possible , improving their access to reproductive and educational services			1
" there are an estimate of 222 million women in the developing world who are in union , who want family planning and they are not getting it , " he says , citing a shortage of funding and cultural obstacles among the reasons for the lack of universal access to reproductive services			1
according to a @entity3 report released last week , meeting the family planning needs of those 222 million women would have resulted in 26 million fewer abortions in the developing world this year			1
@entity1 speaks passionately to world leaders about the agency 's concerns and works closely with women around the world to make sure they have choices and know their rights			1
" i think it 's a job that actually was made for me and i say that with all sense of responsibility , " explains @entity1			2
" the natural thing to do was now to do something that actually gives me a global sense , given all the experience i have and the natural work that i 'd been able to establish			0
" and i think linking back to what i did , practicing or as a minister of the @entity91 field , it was all about reproductive health to reproductive rights , gender , women 's health and i think it just all fits			1
" but above all , @entity1 , a father of five , says what needs to be changed is the status of women around the world			2
" i think that for me is where the problem really is -- how we value women and girls in our societies , " he says			0
" i think that we need to do far more than just legislation or policies , we need to confront these issues to make a difference			0
" watch video : @entity1 : a global voice for women @entity1 credits his mother for imparting the value of equality to him and shaping his views from an an early age			2
he says : " my mother was an entrepreneur , a mother , a wife , a community leader and she was very strong but she believed in equity of social justice , so i saw her as a role model			0
" @entity1 adds that whether it 's though his current work at the @entity3 or any other posts in the future , he will always fight for women 's empowerment			1
" i truly believe that women will change the world , " he says			0
" i say that with all seriousness -- as a teacher in a medical school , my best students were women			0
" as physicians they are the best and , really , when you look at different aspects of life , even peace - building , women they build better peace			0
so , let 's give them a chance			0
