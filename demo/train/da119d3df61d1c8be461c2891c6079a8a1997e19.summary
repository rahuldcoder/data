-- the father of a 10 - year - old @entity3 girl who desperately needs new lungs told @entity0 on wednesday night that the family was " very excited " after a judge 's ruling that could help his daughter get a transplant			1
@entity11 's father , @entity10 , said on @entity0 's " @entity12 " that his daughter , who has cystic fibrosis , has declined slightly in the ast two days			1
" but we 're very excited with the news today , that she will have the opportunity to be equally judged and have the opportunity to receive lungs , " he said			1
on wednesday , the family asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block @entity23 @entity25 secretary @entity24 from having the agency that oversees transplants apply a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants			1
the judge granted the injunction and ordered @entity24 to direct the @entity33 to waive the rule in @entity11 's case			1
the injunction is valid for 10 days			1
@entity25 declined to comment " on an ongoing legal matter , " said spokesman @entity38			2
but a letter from @entity24 was sent to the organ network thursday morning , directing them to comply with the judge 's order			0
" i understand that ... last night at 10:34 p.m. eastern time , @entity33 created a second candidate record for @entity49 with a birthdate that makes the system treat her as a 12 - year - old , " the letter says			2
" i also understand her original record remains active , so she retains her priority for pediatric donors			0
" @entity11 could die within weeks without a transplant , her parents have said			1
but they do n't expect her to be moved to the top of the list			0
" we have never , ever asked that @entity11 get special attention or be placed in front of anyone more severe than her , " her father said			1
" so if there ... is another adult who is more severe , who has a higher lung allocation score , they will still get their lungs first			2
" where someone is placed on the adult lung transplant list depends on several factors : blood type , distance from donor to potential recipient and a lung allocation score			2
the score is derived from medical factors like test results and the patient 's diagnosis			0
@entity11 's parents said her score is a 78			1
anything above 60 is considered a high score , according to reports published on the @entity33 website			0
@entity93 said @entity11 was not aware of the specifics of her parent 's quest to have the policy changed but was told about the judge 's ruling that will help her			1
dying girl 's plight sparks fight over organ transplants " she is so strong , " he said			0
" it 's amazing when you get to speak to her how strong and positive she is			0
" the @entity108 had argued that since the number of children 's lungs available through organ donation programs is so small , @entity11 -- and other pediatric patients like her -- should be added to the list of people waiting for adult lungs , prioritized by severity of their illnesses			1
according to the @entity33 , or @entity33 , five children received lung transplants in the first three months of the year and 72 were on the waiting list			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity33 said the group was awaiting clarification from the court on the ruling			2
two days ago , the @entity108 asked @entity24 to change the rules			2
she has previously told the family that she does n't have the authority to intervene in a particular case , but she also called for the policy review			0
any change could take up to two years			0
several lawmakers have urged @entity24 to act			0
sen. @entity135 and rep. @entity136 , both @entity3 republicans , co-signed a letter to the secretary saying in part , " you have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for @entity11 and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs			1
" @entity135 issued a statement wednesday saying he was happy the judge acted quickly			0
" now @entity11 has a chance for a lung transplant , and i plan to keep fighting for her and others who deserve to be eligible , " he said			1
" as i 've said all along , @entity152 should use her authorities to make medical need and suitability , rather than age , be the primary criteria in determining how organ donations are prioritized			0
" @entity136 said he will continue to fight to have the " arbitrary " policy changed			0
the @entity161 girl has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated			0
adult lungs are far more available than lungs from children , and doctors have said they believe modified adult lungs might save the girl 's life			1
@entity0 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0

@entity178 says daughter has declined in past two days , but the ruling has them all excited
parents say policy prevents many children under 12 from getting a transplant
doctors say she could be saved with modified adult lungs
@entity11 , 10 , has cystic fibrosis and may have just weeks to live
