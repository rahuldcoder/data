-- what should most worry the leaders of the federal government -- the president , the top officials in @entity5 , @entity6 , republicans , everyone who failed to find a way to avoid the forced budget cuts ? what should make them fully understand what the stakes of their ineffectuality really are ? those stakes , in the end , have little to do with numbers or dollar figures			1
the stakes are considerably more profound than that			0
a hint of what those stakes are can be found in an unlikely place -- a scene in the wonderful 1986 movie " @entity25 , " about basketball in small - town @entity27			2
early in the movie , one of the townspeople -- he 's not very likeable , but his words are memorable -- confronts the newly arrived coach			0
the man says : " look , mister			0
there 's two kinds of dumb			0
@entity37 that gets naked and runs out in the snow and barks at the moon			2
and guy who does the same thing in my living room			2
" first one do n't matter			0
the second one , you 're kind of forced to deal with			1
" most of the time , official @entity48 can bark at the moon all it wants , and the nation merely shrugs			1
barking at the moon , it often seems , is @entity48 's job description			1
but once in a while , the country feels that the barking has moved into @entity59 's living rooms -- that it 's time to pay closer attention			1
and when the country decides , person by person , that the men and women they have elected are not up to the job , that 's a tenuous place for the @entity59 to be			1
@entity69 : @entity59 sick of budget soap opera the @entity71 and members of @entity5 have known since the summer of 2011 that , unless they could come up with a way to reach a compromise â € ” together , across party lines -- the mandatory , across - the - board budget cuts would kick in			1
they could n't do it			0
they played a game , and the country lost			0
" @entity82 , " it 's called			0
the term is one of bravado -- daring the other side to blink			0
in his recent book " @entity93 , " journalist and historian @entity87 traces the term back to @entity91 , president @entity92 's secretary of state			2
@entity91 took pride in bluffing communist nations of that era to back down : " if you run away from it , if you are scared to go to the brink , you are inevitably lost			2
" but if brinksmanship as a tool in international diplomacy is a risky proposition , brinksmanship as a constant , cynical tactic in domestic politics can make the citizens -- the voters -- resentful and angry			1
voters do n't want to hear why the men and women they elected ca n't get the job done			0
no one forced the elected officials to run for the offices they now hold			0
" the @entity59 governs by crisis these days , " @entity114 and @entity115 wrote last week in the @entity116 , " and neither side seems capable of doing anything about it			2
" both sides , in explaining their positions as the budget cuts were about to take effect , seemed to all but confirm that analysis			0
president @entity128 , speaking to reporters at the @entity71 , said : " so ultimately , if @entity130 or @entity131 say , ' we need to go to catch a plane , ' i ca n't have @entity133 block the doorway , right ? " @entity135 , the @entity136 , said : " but there will be no last - minute , back - room deal			1
" yet last - minute deals , back - room or not , are what elected officials at the loftiest levels are supposed to be masters of			1
@entity82 does n't work if the people at the wheels go hurtling over the brink			0
on @entity148 in @entity149 there is a hotel , the @entity151 -- now a part of the @entity154 chain -- that is more than a century old			0
the @entity151 was where the political phrase " smoke - filled room " originated ; in 1920 , @entity158 was chosen as the @entity160 candidate for president by a group of leaders meeting there to hammer out a consensus , even as the official convention was in session in a different part of town			1
a wire - service reporter wrote that the choice had been worked out " in a smoke - filled room , " and it became part of the language			1
it 's probably sacrilege these days to say anything positive about decisions made privately in smoke - filled rooms ( and the @entity151 is a no - smoking - anywhere - on - the - premises hotel today , anyway )			1
but it 's hard to imagine that many people would object if leaders of both parties locked themselves up in a room and did n't emerge until they had , at long last , fashioned a reasonable solution to the budget turmoil			1
it is , after all , what they are paid to do			0
many members of @entity5 work in a pair of buildings named for men who , in an earlier era , understood that			2
the @entity196 , named for longtime @entity6 speaker @entity197 of @entity198 , and the @entity199 , named for longtime @entity200 senator @entity200 of @entity201 , recognize leaders of different parties and different ideologies who knew how , in the end , to cut through the mess and get things done			0
meanwhile , as the first workweek of the forced budget cuts begins monday , expect a familiar sound from @entity48 : more barking at the moon			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			2

@entity214 : @entity48 failed to find a way to avoid forced *spending* cuts
he says @entity59 can usually ignore @entity5 ' constant barking at moon . not this time
this time @entity128 and @entity5 failure to compromise hits people more directly at home
@entity214 : even if it was in a ' smoke - filled " back room , leaders used to be able to make a deal
