@entity0 -- doctors who treat breast cancer patients are very excited about an experimental drug that presents a whole new way of knocking out cancer cells			1
the drug , trastuzumab emtansine , commonly referred to as @entity9 , appears to be superior to the standard treatment for women with advanced @entity13 - positive breast cancer			1
researchers are presenting the results of a large three - year clinical trial sunday at the 2012 @entity18 conference in @entity0			1
it 's a combination of the targeted drug trastuzumab ( the " t " in @entity9 ) , better known by the brand name @entity22 , and a very powerful chemotherapy drug called emtansine ( the " @entity9 " part )			1
the drug is designed to work when @entity22 alone no longer can keep the cancer in check			1
new drugs may help immune system fight cancer " it 's a brand new way of treating @entity13 - positive breast cancer , " said the lead study author , dr. @entity33			1
" this will offer a very important therapeutic option for patients faced with @entity13 - positive metastatic breast cancer			1
" in this combination drug , @entity22 is delivering the chemo drug to the cancer cell			1
@entity43 likens it to being used like a carrier pigeon that delivers the @entity9 drug , which is what kills the cancer cell			1
@entity49 is too toxic to deliver directly into the bloodstream like other chemotherapy drugs			0
so the @entity22 part of @entity9 homes in on the cancer cells ( sparing other healthy cells ) and delivers the powerful @entity9 chemo drug into the cell			1
about 20 % to 25 % of women with breast cancer have @entity13 - positive breast cancer , a particularly aggressive and deadly form of the disease that was very difficult to treat until the @entity63 approved @entity22 in 1998 , revolutionizing how this type of cancer was treated			1
@entity22 is an engineered antibody that attaches to the surface of the cancer cell and blocks signals in the cell that tell the cancer to grow			2
it also boosts the patient 's immune system to help fight the cancer			2
but in some patients , the cancer comes back , and @entity22 eventually stops working			1
that 's when doctors prescribe a combination of the drugs capecitabine ( brand name @entity78 ) and lapatinib ( brand name @entity82 ) , which has had its successes			0
in this clinical trial , nearly 1,000 patients were divided into two groups : one got the standard capecitabine plus lapatinib treatment ; the other group got the experimental drug			2
women getting @entity9 had 9.6 months of progression - free survival , the time between starting the treatment and the cancer getting worse again , compared with 6.4 months in the standard therapy group			1
that 's a median improvement of three months			0
this may not seem like a long time , but as dr. @entity99 of the @entity100 in @entity101 explains , it means a lot to the individual patient			0
" i 've had patients on this drug for one , two , three years , " he explained			2
@entity99 says that if a patient gets an additional three months before the tumors start growing again each time she goes through a treatment cycle , that can add up to almost a year			0
some doctors do n't know long - term side effects of cancer care @entity43 says that after two years , 65 % of women getting @entity9 were still alive , compared with 48 % in the control group			1
and even though this drug is not a cure , many oncologists call these trial results a " huge deal			2
" that 's because another significant benefit with @entity9 was the lack of significant side effects and better quality of life			2
women on @entity9 did not suffer the usual and often grueling chemotherapy side effects seen in the other group : diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , painful hand - foot syndrome and hair loss			0
@entity43 said the types of side effects they did have were the kind only a doctor would notice			0
" it really changed their whole outlook on what it meant to be on cancer treatment , " said @entity43 , who treats patients at @entity140			2
she added that seeing this benefit for her patients was incredibly rewarding as a breast cancer doctor			1
this is the first group of ( breast cancer ) patients where we have to worry about fixing their hair for media interviews			1
it 's huge deal for these patients			0
" " it 's producing very promising results , and as someone who sees a ton of patients , what i 'm really excited about is the side effect profile , " said dr. @entity161 , who treats breast cancer patients at the @entity163 in @entity164 but who was not involved in the study			1
" it 's significantly better than most chemotherapy drugs that we 're giving			0
" this trial is showing pretty impressive results on the tip of the iceberg where immune therapy can take us , " @entity161 said			0
dr. @entity181 , director of @entity183 's @entity182 , agrees , calling @entity9 a " magic bullet			0
" " it represents the fruition of a concept that was advocated more than 100 years ago by @entity188 , the famous immunologist and @entity190 winner , who dreamed of creating basically @entity192 horses that would be welcomed into the cell but would be dragging something that is very bad for the cell			0
this is pretty much how @entity9 works , " he said			0
" it 's a good drug			0
i think it will be used quite a bit , " @entity99 said			0
right now , only women participating in the clinical trial have access to this new drug , until it gets approved in the @entity204 and other countries			0
@entity206 , the company that developed @entity9 , says an application for potential approval will be sent to the @entity63 and the @entity210 counterpart , the @entity211 , this year			0
it 's unclear how much this new drug will cost , but other new cancer drugs can be very expensive , costing upwards of tens of thousands of dollars , sometime even around $ 100,000			2
" i hope it wo n't be priced at such a level that it that bankrupts our health care system , " @entity99 said .			0

researchers say drug combination is superior in fighting @entity13 - positive cancer
20 % to 25 % of breast cancer patients have aggressive @entity13 - positive form
study shows drug extended progression - free survival time , researchers say
" very promising results " *include* better quality of life
