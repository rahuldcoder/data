@entity0 -- astronomers have discovered a new planet that just may be able to support life in a nearby solar system a mere 20 light years from @entity6			1
it 's called @entity8 and is located in the constellation @entity10			0
it circles the red dwarf star @entity13			0
according to a research that is set to be published in the @entity16 , the planet is " squarely in the middle of the habitable zone of the star " which offers a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet around a very nearby star			1
when a planet falls in the " habitable zone " it means that it orbits the star at a distance that allows for the planet to have both liquid water and an atmosphere , two conditions that are considered important for life to exist			1
" our findings offer a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet , " said astronomy professor @entity34 of the @entity35 who lead the research along with astronomer @entity37 of the @entity38			1
to scientists a " potentially habitable " planet is not one where humans would want to live , but rather one that could sustain life			2
the scientists believe the new planet has a mass three to four times that of @entity6 and orbits its star approximately every 37 days			1
it 's likely rocky planet , according to @entity34			2
size is another factor in determining the likelihood of a planet to be able to support life			0
it has to be large enough to hold an atmosphere , but not so large that it becomes an " ice giant " like @entity66 or @entity67			2
" if we discover life outside our planet , it would perhaps be the most significant discovery of all time , " said @entity68 of the @entity69			0
" this is clearly one of the most exciting areas of science these days			0
" the report can be found at @entity79 .			0

@entity82 581g is 20 light years from @entity6 -- a near *neighbor* by *galactic* *standards*
soon - to - be - published research says body is in " habitable " zone of its solar system
scientists believe @entity82 581g has a mass three to four times that of @entity6
a habitable planet has to be a rocky planet large enough to hold an atmosphere
