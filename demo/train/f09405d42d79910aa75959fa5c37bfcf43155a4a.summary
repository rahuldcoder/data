-- @entity1 shrugged off conceding an early goal to beat @entity4 side @entity3 2 - 1 and qualify for the group stages of the @entity6 with a 3 - 1 aggregate victory			1
minus star players @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity1 saw their 1 - 0 first leg advantage wiped out in just four minutes in @entity12 when @entity14 international @entity13 put @entity3 ahead			1
but @entity16 's side drew level seven minutes from time as @entity3 's @entity17 turned a @entity19 cross into his own net			1
@entity21 , at fault for the first goal , then added as second in the 88th minute when goalkeeper @entity25 could only push out @entity27 's shot into the @entity29 's path			0

@entity60 went out of the competition to the same opponents last year and had expected to reverse that result after drawing 1 - 1 away in the first leg			2
@entity69 , who like @entity1 and @entity60 are former @entity71 champions , eased through with a 1 - 0 home win over @entity73 of @entity64 in @entity74 after leading 2 - 1 from the away leg			1
but it was a disastrous night for @entity77 clubs with @entity78 crashing 4 - 0 away to @entity79 with @entity80 scoring a hat - trick			0
@entity78 had led 2 - 0 from the first leg			0
@entity82 lost out to @entity84 side @entity85 and @entity86 exited to @entity87 of @entity88 .			0
