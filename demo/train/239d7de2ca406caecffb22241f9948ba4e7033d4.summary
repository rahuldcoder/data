-- in march this year , @entity2 's president @entity1 officially launched the new @entity4 project , a massive infrastructure project that is expected to cost a whopping $ 20 billion			1
the red - carpet affair was attended by his @entity8 and @entity9 counterparts , @entity10 and @entity11 respectively , on a stretch of leveled mangroves , flattened especially for the launch			0
the new port is part of a larger project , known as @entity18 ( @entity4 -- @entity8 -- @entity19 ) , a pearl in the crown of the @entity2 government 's @entity22 , an ambitious program to propel @entity2 's economy , like those witnessed in @entity27			1
the @entity18 project includes an oil refinery , pipelines from @entity8 , transportation hubs for rail , road and air , and a mega port for oil tankers , plus a number of tourist resort cities along its path			1
several months on , very little work has been done , even though president @entity1 committed the finance minister to release funds to enable construction of the first three berths			0
rumors circulate that the government lacks financial backing even though the local media ascribes @entity50 as the main supporters because of their desire for @entity8 's oil			1
watch : bringing @entity8 oil to @entity2 it is no wonder at the speculation			1
the @entity4 plans have been shrouded in secrecy ever since the government began its search for capital			1
the lack of transparency and the dearth of information have created an aura of suspicion and mistrust of the government , particularly among affected communities			2
@entity70 is listed as a @entity71 by @entity72			2
the medieval stone town is the home of @entity76 culture and architecture			0
its rich history is linked to the @entity81 trade - world , connecting @entity50 , @entity82 and the @entity83 from as early as the 9th century			0
early stone ruins of @entity76 towns dot the area under the care of the @entity88			0
nearby , a marine reserve protects the islands dotting the @entity91 teeming with coral and mangrove and home to endangered marine animals like sea turtles and dugongs			0
@entity98 , the @entity99 -- last of the coastal forests that once spread from @entity2 to @entity101 -- is listed as a protected biosphere with conservationists actively trying to protect the area because of its concentration of endemic plants and animals and the fast rate at which it is disappearing			2
@entity109 is home to five indigenous ethnic groups : @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity76 and @entity114 , who have lived with political marginalization since @entity2 's independence			1
each of these communities utilize their natural resources for survival			0
traditionally the @entity114 are pastoralists , @entity122 and @entity76 are fishermen and farmers , the @entity111 and @entity112 are hunters and gatherers			0
their livelihoods and cultural existence are at stake with the government 's plan to build a mega port and transport corridor linking @entity70 to @entity8 and @entity9			2
@entity70 , a coalition of local civil society organizations , is taking the government to court over the port project			1
they argue that the government is legally bound to provide an environmental impact assessment ( @entity140 ) by independent experts and consultations with the community			1
this , they claim , has not been done			0
" we have been the stewards of this land and coastline for centuries , " says @entity146 , member of the @entity148 coalition and a legal petitioner			0
" how can the government begin to construct such a huge project with dire environmental hazards without consulting us and without an @entity140 ? " @entity2 pm : @entity8 conflict threatens world oil prices @entity146 's words are echoed by many in @entity163			1
one of the biggest community complaints is the lack of transparency on the part of the government			2
" getting information about the port project is incredibly difficult , " states @entity169 , chairperson of the @entity148 coalition			1
@entity70 maintains that it is not against the port , but against the way it feels the government is strong - arming the community into submission			2
" they say we are anti-port and anti-development , " states @entity179			0
but we are demanding that the government provide us with information , otherwise it appears that the new port will only benefit a few select people			1
" and that is the way it looks from the ground			0
land ownership is a heated point of contention here			0
as well it would be , for the majority of the county 's land mass is categorized as @entity2 government land			1
@entity70 's indigenous communities have lacked legal land rights and , under corrupt administrations , their ancestral land has been a means of rewarding political cronies			0
many locals believe that the port project will obliterate their culture heritage			1
the population of the county , according to reports , is expected to increase tenfold , from 110,000 people today to 1.25 million in 10 years			0
the incoming migration will make the indigenous communities a minority , thus disabling any political power that they might wield			0
the population increase is also expected to damage @entity70 's status as a world heritage site			0
at the latest @entity219 in @entity220 , in june 2012 , @entity2 's @entity18 project and its effects on @entity70 was discussed			1
the committee recommended that the @entity2 government halt the project until an @entity225 report is provided to @entity72			1
whether the government will agree is not certain			2
meanwhile , @entity70 's momentum is gathering strength and their court case is pending			2
the growing opposition to the @entity18 project by local and international organizations may bring the government to the negotiating table to rethink its plans for @entity18			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			0

the @entity2 government has *announced* plans for a new port in @entity163 , a @entity71
it is part of bigger project that includes an oil refinery , pipelines from @entity246 and transportation hubs
local civil society groups are taking the government to court over the port project
they ask for more information and call for an environmental impact assessment
