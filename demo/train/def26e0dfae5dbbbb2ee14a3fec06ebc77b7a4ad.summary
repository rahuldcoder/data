@entity0 -- @entity2 is an electrical engineer by trade , but grassroots politics may be his true passion			1
the @entity7 native has worked for years with his local @entity8 in @entity9 , and is chairman of @entity11 , a so - called " super pac " that " promotes conservative @entity8 ' time - proven messages and effective solutions			1
" @entity2 's success in business and a willingness to put his money into @entity8 coffers has put him at the center of a politically tricky @entity21 fight over federal campaign donations			1
oral arguments in the case will be heard on tuesday , a day after the court begins its new term			0
the government shutdown is not expected to affect the court 's normal work schedule			0
at issue is whether strict limits on direct campaign contributions by individuals -- in the @entity34 -- violate the @entity35			1
a ruling by spring could have an immediate impact on the congressional midterm elections next november , and be another blow to existing federal election laws			1
the appeal from the 46 - year - old owner of a @entity44 - based company is supported in court by the @entity46			0
they object to a 1970s @entity49 - era law restricting someone from giving no more than $ 48,600 to federal candidates , and $ 74,600 to political action committees , during a two - year election cycle -- for a maximum of $ 123,200			0
@entity55 , executive power on @entity21 docket @entity2 says he has a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wants , so long as no one candidate gets more than the $ 2,600 per election limit			0
he supports those individual controls , but " what does n't make any sense is that you can only give that amount of money to a few candidates , because somehow my giving money to ( @entity72 rep. ) @entity71 of @entity7 could corrupt ( former rep. ) @entity73 of @entity74			1
that 's just nutty , but that 's what the powers - that - be want : to prevent folks who want to get involved from having the same ability to get involved and support candidates that big union pacs have			0
" political speech or not ? @entity2 equates his donations to " core political speech			0
" but backers of continued congressional regulation do not see it that way			1
" the reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness , so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations , we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate , " said @entity91 , a prominent @entity93 fundraiser			1
" that 's why there are limitations , so that everyone has an equal or fair voice in the process			0
not only are our elections being put up for auction , these donors are making an investment in the democratic system for their own agenda and we taxpayers have to foot the bill , " he said			1
@entity91 , too , lives and breathes politics and is a member of the national party 's finance team , helping raise about $ 500,000 for president @entity122 's re-election effort			1
fundamental debate a special three - judge federal panel in @entity0 earlier rejected @entity2 's appeal			0
the competing arguments are stark : supporters of campaign finance reform say current federal regulations are designed to prevent corruption in politics			1
opponents said it would criminalize free speech and association			0
the current case deals with direct political contributions			1
a separate 2010 high court case dealt with campaign spending by outside groups , seeking to influence federal elections			1
there , the conservative majority -- citing free speech concerns -- eased long - standing restrictions on " independent spending " by corporations , labor unions , and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns			0
the so - called " @entity152 " ruling helped open the floodgates to massive corporate spending in the 2012 elections			1
it also led to further litigation seeking to loosen current restrictions on both the spending and donation areas			0
the three - year - old ruling also put corporations on the same free speech footing as wealthy individuals , who have long enjoyed the ability to spend freely on behalf of federal candidates			1
that and a subsequent decision from a federal appeals court in @entity0 have led to a proliferation of so - called " super pacs " -- separate political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash from businesses , unions , and advocacy groups			1
these super pacs are independent political organizations operating as " 527s , " named after the tax code governing their operation			0
they can not contribute directly to a federal candidate or political party			0
limits on direct contributions to candidates by corporations and individuals remain in place , the focus in part of the current @entity2 appeal			1
some political experts say a ruling in favor of increased , or even unlimited , aggregate individual donor contributions could put party committees and political action committees on a greater competitive track with the " super pacs			1
" all pacs are organizations that campaign either for or against candidates , legislation , or ballot measures			1
the difference is in how they are organized for regulatory and tax purposes , and by the amounts of money they are allowed to spend			0
regular pacs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties , while super pacs can not			0
legal , political fallout if they win at the high court , wealthy donors like @entity2 -- whether @entity219 , @entity8 , or @entity220 -- could in theory contribute a maximum $ 3.6 million to the national and state parties , and the 450 or so @entity223 and @entity224 candidates expected to run in 2014			1
@entity226 for the conservative majority court is whether the current law has a permissible goal of preventing political corruption or the appearance of it			0
and both sides of the legal fight have entrenched views on that			2
" limitations on a citizen 's first amendment rights can not be drawn to target the most outlandish hypotheticals that interest groups can conceive , " said the @entity236 and @entity237 in a legal brief			0
" especially where those interest groups have an interest in manufacturing the ' appearance ' of corruption that this court has held can justify campaign finance regulation			2
" but those who want current controls to remain in place say if aggregate contribution limits to candidates or parties disappear , it would make it easier for the money to get routed by party leaders into other close races nationwide			2
" if the court continues in the direction of @entity152 , " said sen. @entity262 ( @entity263 ) in a recent speech sponsored by the progressive @entity265 , " we may move another step closer to neutering @entity270 ' ability to limit the influence of money in politics and another step closer to unlimited corporate contributions given directly to candidates and political committees			1
" what is the impact ? another point of contention is whether the aggregate spending limits are really having a pervasive effect , or only involve a relative few well - heeled givers			1
figures from the @entity286 for the 2012 race showed about 600 donors leveraged their money to each give the maximum of about $ 48,000 total -- benefitting no more than 17 presidential or congressional candidates			2
almost 1700 contributors forked over the maximum limit to party committees , which added up to more than $ 100 million			0
loosening those limits , say opponents of the law , would benefit wealthy liberals and conservatives equally			2
but the @entity21 has never in its history overturned a federal contribution limit			0
" now imagine that overall contribution limits are struck down			2
presidential candidates in 2016 could solicit and each of these donors could contribute as much as $ 1.2 million to their joint fundraising committees " said @entity305 , founder and president of @entity307 , a longtime activist on campaign spending reform			2
" it may well open the door to striking down all of the remaining contribution limits , taking us back to the robber - baron era			2
" the presidential campaigns of @entity122 and his @entity8 opponent @entity320 were able to create joint fundraising committees and , working with their respective parties , pool fundraising resources			1
that meant those campaigns were able to solicit contributions to the maximum $ 70,800 per donor			2
@entity305 says an end to contribution limits would be an " unmitigated disaster			2
" but @entity2 argues that characterizing the legal fight as between " good " and " bad " simply blurs the truth			2
" getting rid of the aggregate limits is not about corrupting democracy -- it is about practicing democracy , " he said			0
" this case is about freedom -- your freedom and my freedom -- to express ourselves openly and fully within our political system			0
and if there is one thing that we @entity72 believe with all our hearts , it is that freedom never corrupts			0
" the case is @entity349 ( 12 - 536 ) .			0
