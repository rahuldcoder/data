-- the media have been giving us binders full of blather			1
in a campaign that is supposedly , allegedly and ostensibly about big and serious issues , we have been wallowing in what amounts to sideshow stuff			1
it 's not just the focus on @entity11 saying at last week 's presidential debate that in looking for appointees in @entity14 he received " binders full of women , " an admittedly funny phrase that exploded on cable news			1
the trending @entity19 topic after this week 's face off was president @entity22 's line about @entity11 hearkening back to a military backed by " horses and bayonets			1
" journalists after the first debate flocked to that towering issue known as @entity29			1
are the media trivializing the campaign ? we have , through the course of this endless campaign season , bounced from one ephemeral controversy to the next , from the dog on the roof to " oops ! " from @entity41 to @entity39 's laughter			1
journalists have pounced on botched phrases deemed to be gaffes : " i like being able to fire people ; " " you did n't build that ; " " @entity49 never worked a day in her life ; " " i 'm not concerned about the very poor			0
" sometimes there are legitimate questions embedded in the choice of language , as with @entity11 's apparent dismissal of 47 % of @entity56 , but more often it 's just a chance to turn the candidate into a @entity60 ± ata			0
' binders full of women ' overshadows presidential debate campaigns have always had their lighter side , of course , but this year we seem to be getting more empty calories than ever			1
that is not to slight the dogged reporters who have in fact delved into the issues and done the arduous work of fact - checking the candidates ' ads and utterances			1
but let 's face it : how often has their work been on the front pages or at the top of the newscasts ? sure , in an age of on - demand information , you can gorge yourself on the candidates ' conflicting arguments on the auto bailout or trade with @entity92			2
but the media create narratives by cranking up the volume , and you have to strain to hear the issues dissected in a way you did n't when @entity98 was throwing around his birtherism nonsense			1
yes , the substantive pieces have run on inside newspaper pages , occasionally on home pages , and popped up on television , which has a harder time coping with complexity			0
so much easier for all of us to trumpet the latest poll			0
more dual - screen users tweeting during debates in their debates , the candidates have clashed on tax cuts , health care , immigration , @entity115 and other vital questions			2
you might wonder : is @entity11 suddenly moderating positions he has taken for the last two years ? why , on monday night in @entity119 , did he keep agreeing with @entity22 's foreign policy ? does the president have a real second - term agenda ? yet the post-game chatter has zeroed in on zingers , body language , interruptions and attacks on the moderators themselves			2
the foreign policy debate was sober and high - minded ; does anyone actually believe the media will be exploring the exchanges on @entity135 and @entity136 for more than 24 hours ? some of this sustained superficiality has to do with today 's relentless news cycle and shrinking attention spans			1
" you ca n't talk in 140 characters on @entity19 about the complexities of the budget or taxes , " veteran journalist @entity140 told me on @entity142			0
maybe so , but does that mean we just punt ? @entity22 , @entity150 and 2012 's comedy factor the burden falls on the candidates as well			0
if they speak in vague sound bites and duck hard choices , it 's more difficult ( but hardly impossible ) for news organizations to put substantive questions front and center			0
what 's more , they are increasingly ignoring the media 's attempts to call them on exaggerations and falsehoods			2
" we 're not going ( to ) let our campaign be dictated by fact - checkers , " @entity11 pollster @entity167 said at the @entity169 convention			2
@entity174 , campaigns felt compelled to make adjustments when their distortions were spotlighted			0
these days they just double the ad buy			0
have you noticed how many times the media have declared that we are about to plunge into a dead - serious debate ? first the campaign was going to be about the economy			1
when the @entity184 upheld @entity185 , we were assured that health care would be a dominant issue			0
when @entity11 picked @entity189 , the pundits agreed that this would be a big election about @entity192 and budget - cutting			2
instead we wound up with endless stories about @entity189 's @entity196 workout			0
hey , i get it			0
everyone 's chasing clicks and eyeballs			2
delving into the intricacies of how @entity22 and @entity11 would fix @entity192 can be eye - glazing , while writing about @entity204 and @entity49 on " @entity205 " is fun			0
but as the clock runs out on the 2012 race , i 'm left with this nagging feeling : do n't we deserve a better campaign ? and are n't the media partially responsible ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 : we *'ve* seen media seize on a parade of trivial statements in campaign
he cites " binders full of women , " " horses and bayonets " and @entity29
@entity214 says *coverage* of the substance of the campaign gets overshadowed by minor things
he says media chasing an *audience* *discard* serious issues and focus on crowd - *pleasing* themes
