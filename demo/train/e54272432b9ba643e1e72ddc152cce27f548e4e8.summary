-- guess that overheating issue is n't such a big deal after all			0
less than two weeks after @entity5 engineers found that @entity7 's new tablet can get as hot as 116 degrees while running games , the magazine has declared it the best in breed , placing it at the top of its tablet - computer rankings on monday			2
" the high - resolution screen of the new @entity16 establishes a new benchmark in excellence , providing the best rendering of detail and color accuracy we 've ever seen on a tablet display , " reviewer @entity13 wrote on the @entity5 site			1
the review called the @entity16 " superb in virtually every other way as well , " noting a vastly improved camera , a fast , dependable connection ( on @entity28 's @entity27 ) , and longer battery life than any other tablet tested by the product - review group			1
in an earlier test using a thermal - imaging camera , @entity5 engineers recorded temperatures up to 13 degrees higher than the @entity16 2 on the new ipad while playing a video game , " @entity38 " but monday 's report downplayed that			1
" ( @entity43 ) e did n't find those temperatures to be cause for concern , " the report says			0
some reports have found the tablet wo n't recharge while playing power - intensive games , but @entity5 ' testing showed that problem also to be limited			2
" our high overall judgment of the new @entity16 was not affected by the results of either battery of tests			0
" since the @entity16 launched in 2010 , its sales have dwarfed those of any other tablet			0
but @entity5 did have some praise monday for some of the @entity7 juggernaut 's competitors			0
the 10.1 - inch @entity64 was the lightest tablet the group has tested , at a little over one pound , and @entity67 's new 8 - inch element tab was praised for its claim of being waterproof			1
the @entity69 and @entity71 's @entity70 2.2 were also among newly reviewed tablets that earned a recommendation			1
the @entity16 was n't perfect , according to the review			0
@entity5 noted that , in some applications designed for previous models ( notably magazines ) , its high - definition screen magnifies imperfections			1
but that was n't enough to knock it out of the top spot			0
" on balance , however , the screen quality of the new @entity16 is a significant plus , especially given the likelihood that content will increasingly rise in resolution to take advantage of it , " according to the review .			2

*consumer* reports names the new @entity16 as its most recommended tablet
high - resolution screen , better camera and fast connection earned a high score
tablets from @entity71 , @entity102 , @entity69 and @entity67 were also recommended
