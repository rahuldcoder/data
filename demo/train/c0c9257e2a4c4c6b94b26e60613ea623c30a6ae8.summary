their experience at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity25 , was particularly welcoming , complete with a festive @entity33 party with live @entity18 music			2
" honestly , though , while all of our accommodations were great , we were not in our rooms much since we had a lot of exploring to do , " @entity13 said			1
@entity13 shared her favorite discoveries on @entity41 : do n't - miss experiences @entity23 : hike up @entity43 -- it was n't an easy trek for us , but the views once we arrived were breathtaking			1
@entity24 : helicopter tour of the island -- you ca n't get to some parts of the island very easily without hiking , so the ride provides a panoramic view of what we would not have seen			1
this trip was very much worth the money ! @entity25 : sunrise at @entity59 -- we were told it would be cold when we did the sunrise at @entity59 ... and it was ! fifty degrees does n't sound too bad , but we sure were freezing even with jackets and blankets			0
but the experience is not to be missed			0
@entity26 : @entity67 -- this was an unexpected stop on our way to the @entity72			1
the sand there is literally black , a byproduct of the lava that surrounds the island			1
it was absolutely gorgeous , and there were several huge sea turtles close to the shore			0

did they change ? impressions changed dramatically from island to island			0
they each are so different and beautiful , from the populous , energy - filled @entity23 , to the lush environment of @entity24 , the valleys of @entity25 and the lava terrain of the @entity26			1
travel snapshots : natural beauty shines in @entity3 lasting memory for me , the most significant lasting memory ( and it 's hard to pick one ) was the @entity67			2
it was something i had never seen before , and it was just beautiful beyond words			0
three adjectives that capture this place scenic ; distinctive ; adventure - filled			2
( and i 'll throw in beautiful ! ) biggest surprise my biggest surprise was the helicopter ride on @entity24			1
we would have missed a lot of the beauty of that island , especially the @entity114 and the @entity115			0
i would highly recommend [ @entity116 ]			0
i was very apprehensive about the idea of a helicopter ride and even took a motion sickness prevention pill just in case			2
but our pilot , @entity122 , who was a former @entity121 pilot , did a great job			0
the ride did n't come cheap , but it was a ride of a lifetime ! we all agreed we would do it again , maybe on the @entity26 next time			1
most delicious food or drink our favorite meal was in @entity130 on the @entity26 at a place called the @entity132			1
we had macadamia nut - crusted scallops , and they were absolutely delicious			1
our favorite drinks were at the luau in @entity31 on @entity25 , where they served a tasty frozen lava flow			0
you use rum , coconut rum , strawberries , banana , pineapple juice and coconut cream			0
it 's a recipe we hope to replicate at home soon ! the whole night was a great experience , starting with receiving our gorgeous fuchsia / white plumeria leis ; watching the natives display their craft skills around the perimeter of the venue ( making jewelry , woodworking , weaving palms into flowers and animals , making poi , etc. ) ; watching the removal of the pig from the imu ; a great meal ; and finally the show			0
the dancers were incredible , and all the songs followed a tale they wove into a story of their @entity18 heritage			0
