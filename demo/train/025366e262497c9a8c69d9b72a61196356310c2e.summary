-- @entity1 brought an assault of historic proportions to millions of homeowners in the @entity5 this week			1
damages are estimated at between $ 30 billion and $ 50 billion			2
as the recovery process begins , residents of the hardest - hit areas should follow the advice of local and state authorities and @entity13 representatives			1
as you return to your homes , here are some structural issues to look for and how to address them			1
if your home suffered slight to moderate damage -- basement flooding , broken windows , missing roof shingles â € ” the storm cleanup may be a little easier but no less urgent			1
a compromised roof makes your house vulnerable to more serious issues , while anything flooded becomes a potential breeding ground for mold , mildew or rot if not addressed quickly			1
downed power lines are perhaps the biggest risk after a storm of this size			2
avoid wading into standing water or going anywhere near ground wires			2
just because you have no power in your house does n't mean there is n't a live current			2
before you do anything , take pictures of any damage , however minor , in case you need them for insurance purposes			1
7 health risks after @entity1 flooded basements if basement flooding has left 2 or 3 feet of standing water , your first impulse will be to pump the water out quickly			1
but if you had that much water , the ground around the house may still be fully saturated , increasing the pressure on your home 's walls and foundation			1
this is especially dangerous in old houses with loose stone foundations as opposed to poured concrete			0
pump the water out slowly , a foot a day to be on the safe side			0
anything that is water - soaked is already damaged , so a day or two is not going to matter			0
for those with moderate flooding , let your sump pump do its job ; pick up additional units if necessary			1
a wet vac will also offer a handy assist			0
once the water has been extracted , remove everything that you can : water - soaked boxes , furniture and especially carpeting			0
open vents and windows and set up fans to promote air circulation through the space			0
the sooner everything dries out , the lower the potential for mold , mildew and permanent damage			1
invest in a dehumidifier to fight dampness and facilitate the drying process			0
floodwater can be filled with any number of contaminants , from sewage and sludge to chemicals , gas and motor oils , so be sure to wear gloves and a mask when you start cleaning walls and floors			0
you can purchase a disinfectant or create your own solution of @entity113 to 1 cup bleach per gallon of water			0
use a mop and broom to clear out any mud or debris and be sure to remove any obstructions to drains			1
if you had drywall in the basement or any room of the house that experienced flooding , it will need to be removed and replaced ( same goes for any water - saturated insulation )			1
the chances of it drying out thoroughly are slim , and its potential to foster mold and mildew growth is considerable			2
roof damage with high winds comes the potential for serious roof damage			1
the roof is your home 's greatest defense against the elements , so even minor damage can create serious problems			1
inspect your roof for damaged or missing shingles			2
they will need to be replaced as soon as possible because the exposed roof deck will be subject to further dampness and moisture , which you do n't want as winter approaches			2
if you had more serious roof damage , consult with a roofing contractor to see how you can protect the interior of your home until a professional repair can be made			1
blue tarps offer a temporary solution and may be available through government agencies			0
roof issues can also be evident from inside the house			2
check the ceilings for water spots , particularly in rooms upstairs and near chimneys			2
the presence of water spots suggests that there may be additional roof problems			2
trees and yard cleanup major tree damage ? the municipality , power company , or emergency services in the area may help clear the way			1
if you are able to remove fallen branches safely , you should			0
leave anything more to a qualified tree removal specialist			0
he or she will help you determine whether a damaged tree that 's still standing can be saved			0
if you have shrubs and hedges , they no doubt took a beating , which means pruning may be in order			0
most plants are resilient and will be no worse for wear come summer			0
clear up any debris that might have collected in the yard , disposing of refuse in accordance with local regulations			1
it 's going to take a good long while for everything to dry out			0
but , when the time comes , it will make good sense to power wash the exterior of the house			0
one of the most heartening things to come out of any disaster is the support and help of volunteers , neighbors and community organizations			0
if you were n't personally affected by the storm , think about volunteering to help those in need , particularly the elderly , or support relief organizations such as the @entity218			0
