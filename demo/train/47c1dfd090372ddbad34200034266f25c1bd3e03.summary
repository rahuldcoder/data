their war for freedom in @entity4 may be over , but almost a year after they won the battle for the @entity4 capital , a group of fighters have a new battlefield : @entity8			1
under the command of one of @entity4 's most well known rebel commanders , @entity13 , more than 30 @entity4 fighters have made their way into @entity8 to support the @entity16 rebels in their war against president @entity19 's regime			1
@entity20 , who commanded the @entity22 brigade -- which was the first group of rebels to enter the @entity4 capital last august -- has been in @entity8 for months leading some of his former men and @entity8 military defectors who have joined his " @entity27 " or " @entity28 " brigade			1
recent @entity31 videos show at least two different @entity8 rebel factions announcing that they are part of the @entity34			2
heavy fighting in @entity8 city of @entity37 @entity20 , who has dual @entity4 and @entity39 citizenship , first visited @entity8 last year on what he calls a " fact finding mission " to see the situation on the ground and find out what @entity8 rebels needed			1
" after many @entity8 approached me asking for my help , i felt it was time to do more and due to the great success of the @entity53 we felt it was time to act and that meant the formation of the @entity28 , " @entity20 told @entity46 in @entity48 messages this week			2
@entity20 said : " with the prior success in @entity4 i decided to leave nationality aside and , just like world organizations helped @entity4 in its time of need , i decided to pass my experience to others to benefit			2
" in the past week , at least three more former members of the @entity67 traveled from the @entity4 capital to join their former commander in @entity8 , two former members of the @entity65 says			1
@entity20 , who describes himself as a " commander and facilitator " says there were no active efforts to recruit @entity4			2
" these are grown men with their own minds and do not need convincing about this cause , " @entity20 said			0
@entity77 , 23 , fought in some of the fiercest battles against @entity80 's troops in @entity4 's @entity81			1
one year on , he dreams of fighting @entity19 's troops			0
he does not want his last name disclosed because he does not want his family to know he wants to go to @entity8			0
" what @entity19 is doing is unacceptable in @entity86 ... he is killing children and wiping out entire cities ... the @entity8 need people to fight with them , this is @entity92 , it does not have to be my ( personal ) cause ... as a muslim i have to go and help them , " he said			2
@entity77 smiles as he recalls the fighting in @entity4 last year , like now he says , it was during the @entity99			0
@entity8 rebels appear more capable , yet still outgunned " there is nothing better than @entity92 during @entity103 ... there are some people who look at us and say we are @entity107 extremists , we are not			2
in @entity4 we experienced @entity92 , tasted the beauty of @entity92			0
we are not going to @entity92 like @entity109 and others			0
we are going to support our brothers in @entity8 , " he said			0
he is 33 , @entity116 's brother - in - law , and had never used a weapon until he fought in @entity4 last year			1
he said : " when i watch tv reports ... you hear the cries of an old woman or a mother of a child who has been killed , or some of the brutal pictures that we have seen of children being killed ... i can not sit back and watch that , " @entity114 told @entity46 in a @entity48 interview from one of @entity130 's borders with @entity8 hours before making the dangerous journey into @entity8			2
" i have to do whatever i can to make that journey			0
because i feel guilty putting my head down at nighttime knowing that last year i was given an amazing opportunity to learn how to use weapons , for good , all for good , learn how to use weapons , how to maneuver , how to travel , how to attack , how to defend , all these things , " @entity114 said , adding that his aim is to share these experiences with @entity8 rebels			0
during the interview , @entity114 got the phone call he had been waiting for , his group of fighters is mobilizing to go into @entity8			2
" it is a rollercoaster of different kinds of emotions , you get excited , you get adrenalin , fear , anticipation , all these feelings come into it , fear is not the main factor and in my mind will never be ... it will impair your judgment ... @entity4 was a walk in the park compared to @entity8 , i know this going in there , " @entity114 said as he prepared to leave			1
@entity114 says the no - fly zone enforced in @entity4 last year helped rebel fighters and allowed them to make great advances			1
without that in @entity8 , operating will be much harder			0
he says they do not have a military base , there are makeshift barracks ; they are constantly on the move and can not spend more than a day in one location			0
fighters , he says , are scattered across different areas			0
a @entity8 town 's ' @entity178 ' last month , a senior @entity4 security official told @entity46 the government was aware of @entity4 fighting in @entity8 , but they were individuals and not government sponsored			1
earlier this year , @entity185 's ambassador to the @entity186 , accused @entity4 of hosting and training @entity8 rebels			1
a claim denied by the @entity4 prime minister			0
but @entity4 's government and people have been vocal in their support for the @entity8 opposition			1
@entity4 was one of the first countries to recognize the opposition @entity197 as the legitimate representatives of the @entity8 people and in february , @entity194 expelled @entity19 's diplomats and closed down their embassy			1
many in @entity4 say they relate to @entity8 who want to overthrow the regime			1
it was not too long ago that they lived a similar experience			0
but not everyone chooses to express support militarily			0
some show solidarity by hanging the @entity8 opposition flag outside their shops in @entity194 , flying alongside the @entity4 flag			1
in a @entity31 video posted on july 4 , a group of six @entity4 doctors is seen being greeted by @entity16 troops as they enter @entity8			1
" we are coming for you @entity19 , " says one of the doctors as they shake hands with the heavily armed @entity8 fighters			1
there are no official figures on how many @entity4 are currently in @entity8			2
in february , reports of at least four @entity4 fighters killed in @entity8 circulated , but there has been no government confirmation			1
for fighters like @entity231 , the risk of death is a matter of faith			0
he said : " you have to have faith and you have to say to yourself , " if it 's my time , i will be gone			0
if it 's not my time it will be another amazing journey another amazing victory			0
" " faces of the @entity16			0
