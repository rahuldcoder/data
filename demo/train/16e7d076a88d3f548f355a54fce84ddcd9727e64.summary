-- now on the waiting list for a heart transplant , @entity2 had a procedure friday to insert a device to support the failing heart he has , a family spokesman said			1
the 15 - year - old had a ventricular assist device , or @entity11 , implanted on friday at @entity12 of @entity13 at @entity14 , family friend @entity8 told @entity0			1
a vad is a mechanical pump that 's used to support heart function and blood flow in people who have weakened hearts , according to the @entity20			2
it includes a small tube that carries blood out of the heart into a pump , and another tube carries blood from the pump to blood vessels			0
the vessels deliver the blood to the body			0
vads can be used in people waiting for a heart transplant or those ineligible for a heart transplant , as a long - term solution to help with heart function			1
they can also be used during or after surgery while the heart recovers			0
@entity8 says @entity2 is doing " extremely well			0
" citing patient privacy , a hospital spokeswoman declined to confirm @entity2 's @entity11 procedure , and referred @entity0 to the family for related inquiries			1
the teen has been in the hospital since july 14 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity50			2
@entity2 's health has come into the national spotlight because the hospital first told his family he was ineligible for a spot on the heart transplant list , according to his family			1
but tuesday , according to @entity8 , doctors reversed that decision and gave him top priority			0
an august 7 letter , which @entity8 provided to @entity0 , said that " @entity2 is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance , which is one of our center 's contraindications to listing for heart transplant			1
" noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow - up appointments			2
in a statement tuesday , @entity12 of @entity13 said , " while there has been misinformation circulating , @entity77 's can not discuss the specifics of this case or any other case due to privacy rules			2
" the hospital earlier had said it was working " closely with the family " to find solutions			2
children 's healthcare of @entity13 at @entity14 is in good standing , according to the @entity87 , the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the @entity90			2
a matter of compliance assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient does n't strictly take all required medicines as directed , he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital , said dr. @entity100 , a cardiothoracic surgeon at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , who is not involved with this case			1
but @entity8 said a doctor told the family that @entity2 's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment			1
" the doctor made the decision that he was n't a good candidate because of that , " @entity8 said			0
" i guess he did n't think @entity2 was going to be a productive citizen			0
" @entity2 's mother , @entity117 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity118 that doctors said @entity2 would live only three to six months if he did n't get the heart transplant			1
in the meantime , the story became public in local media			0
the @entity126 's @entity125 chapter got involved because @entity2 's family called , and the organization has " a longtime relationship with the child , " said the rev. @entity131 , the chapter 's president , @entity131 said @entity2 was judged based on " tattoos and an ankle bracelet " from a " juvenile agency			1
" @entity8 said the detention was because @entity2 got into " an altercation to protect his younger brother			0
" on tuesday , @entity8 said , a doctor delivered the groundbreaking news to the family : " he said that @entity2 has been approved to receive a heart			2
he put him on the transplant list			1
" @entity8 said doctors told @entity2 he 'll likely receive a new heart in about three to four months , but that this timetable could change			2
@entity2 had no health problems before this summer , @entity8 said ; the heart problem is not congenital			0
but he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting			0
his mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains			0
@entity8 said @entity2 is excited and his mother overjoyed after the hospital 's reversal			2
the teen is now considered top priority for a heart transplant ; he just has to wait for one to become available			1
the complexity of transplants federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012 , but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed			0
while waiting for a heart transplant , 331 people died			1
dr. @entity168 , medical director of @entity170 's @entity169 and @entity171 , said it 's not unusual for patients to be rejected from organ transplant lists because of noncompliance -- in other words , if they are seen as people who wo n't follow instructions about taking medications and seeing doctors			1
at @entity170 , @entity168 's group evaluates about 300 patients per year for lung transplants and turns down about 1 % to 2 % because of noncompliance			1
it 's about the same for heart transplants as well , he said			2
as part of the evaluation process , organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen , @entity168 said			0
" a few times a year , we run into people who ca n't , " he said			2
a patient would not be turned down solely for having served prison time or having bad grades , @entity168 said , but " we would want to look at the entire picture			0
" some patients have been denied because they do n't have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments			0
after a heart transplant , patients are too sick to do these things alone , @entity168 said			1
" when we fear that someone 's not going to do well , it 's because the patient could n't comply with the regimen or they do n't have any support in their life , " he said			0
psychosocial factors do n't change a person 's priority on the waiting list , but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list , he said			1
the trouble with teens @entity226 , head of the division of medical ethics at @entity229 , noted that patients have to adhere to a lifelong regimen after receiving an organ transplant -- showing up at medical appointments , taking medications , monitoring changes in health -- and teenagers in general do n't have a good track record of following orders			0
teenagers are n't automatically ruled out for heart transplants , but " the consequence that ' you are going to die if you do n't take these medicines ' is far from the mind of a 17 - year - old , " said @entity100 , the cardiothoracic surgeon			1
instead of denying @entity2 a spot on the transplant list , @entity226 suggested that the boy should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what 's expected post-transplant -- that is , if the teenager can get a heart			1
@entity8 said the family did n't press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list			1
personally , @entity8 attributes it to " the handiwork of @entity263 and the media pressure			0
" in a video released by a family friend to @entity0 affiliate @entity50 before the reversal , @entity2 plays chess and looks longingly outside his hospital window			0
the hospital did not comment on what led to doctors ' change of heart .			0
