@entity0 , @entity1 -- the city of @entity4 is steeped in history			1
the central @entity1 town was a stop on the @entity8 , and it was even , briefly , the nation 's capital			1
a week of race riots in @entity4 , @entity1 , left two dead 39 years ago			1
sen. @entity12 's rally here saturday , on the corner of @entity14 and @entity15 , was down the block from a local landmark that touches on a less - heralded chapter in the city 's history : the site of the monument that was n't			1
a few months ago , mayor @entity23 and others pushed for a memorial at the corner of @entity27 and @entity28 , in the center of town , that would remind @entity4 residents of a deadly week of race riots 39 years ago			1
the violence claimed two victims : police officer @entity36 , and minister 's daughter @entity37 , in murders that went unsolved for decades			0
@entity36 was white , @entity41 black			0
but disputes over nearly every aspect of the project brought emotional responses that seemed to split along racial lines , including disagreements over inspiration , location and design			1
the process stalled entirely a few weeks ago , as organizers went back to the drawing board			0
this dispute is emblematic of the divide facing both @entity57 candidates in next tuesday 's @entity1 primary			1
" the issue of race has touched this community , much more deeply than it has in other places			1
it 's not in the forefront , it 's not usually discussed , but that issue has been very important to people here , " said local @entity64 chapter president @entity63 , in a row house just off @entity66 , the main drag that bisects the city 's downtown			1
" historically , this has been a very racially hostile area			0
race relations have always been strained here			1
there 's an old guard , and they have those old ideas , " he said			0
but the face of @entity4 itself has changed			1
a decade ago , the town was 70 percent white			0
city officials say black and @entity86 residents now make up roughly 45 percent of the population of 41,000			2
sen. @entity89 is expected to win the overwhelmingly @entity57 town , locals say , and @entity91 has the edge in @entity93 , an area dominated by white , working - class , conservative voters -- a group that has largely backed the @entity4 senator this year			1
but presidential loyalties here this primary season do n't fall neatly along racial lines -- @entity4 's residents are split between the two candidates in patterns that defy traditional assumptions			1
neatly manicured lawns in some of the city 's mostly white suburbs are dotted with @entity89 signs			1
in the city , a restaurant window near @entity109 -- where @entity110 was killed nearly four decades ago -- has a @entity91 sign taped to the inside glass			2
seven years ago , the town 's mayor and several other white men were arrested for @entity110 's 1969 murder			2
in the shadow of a pending indictment , mayor @entity120 -- up for re-election -- won the @entity57 primary in 2001			0
eventually , he was acquitted by a local jury			2
two others were convicted of murder and others took plea deals			0
in the wake of the trials , the city became a magnet for outside hate groups , who clashed with anti-racist demonstrators in the center of town			2
in the years since , the most public division in @entity4 has been the measure of progress			1
some , including @entity63 , say race is still a central issue here			1
others -- including many resentful of the city 's national notoriety after @entity120 's arrest -- say it is not			2
but most residents fall somewhere in between , caught in a decades - long conversation that moves in fits and starts , spurred along by activists and city officials			1
the national dialogue may have turned to race this campaign season -- but in @entity4 , where the discussion has been on the agenda for years , many say they 're all talked out			1
it 's an undercurrent , " said @entity4 mayor @entity23 , an @entity89 supporter			1
" i do think in places like @entity4 that actually had civil unrest in the 1960s , i think we have more work to do			1
and we 've done a lot of work in recent years			0
most of our voters , i think , have moved on			2
" many of those voters -- among them @entity173 factory workers , waitresses and home health aides -- echoed @entity23 , saying their top concern had nothing to do with race , but with how they were going to pay their rent or afford health care			2
" a few years ago , all those satellite trucks were parked out front for the trial , all those outsiders came to town for a week , and they had the story in their heads before they even got here , " said mechanic @entity182 , just outside the city 's @entity183			2
" you did n't see anyone from around here at the courthouse , except the families			2
but that case is all most people know about @entity4			1
i know that 's what they care about			0
but i have bigger things to worry about			0
like my next mortgage payment			0
" @entity4 has been slightly better off than many of @entity1 's hard - hit industrial areas , thanks to a more diverse local economy and an influx of new residents from neighboring @entity211 that have made it one of the commonwealth 's fastest - growing counties			1
but residents say that thousands of jobs have disappeared -- and with them , a way of life			0
" i know we had that working - class tradition			2
i 'm a product of it , " said @entity23 , whose father was a union electrician			0
" i think @entity93 has changed			0
that whole blue - collar model of the past just does n't work anymore			1
it 's still here , but it 's not as strong as it used to be			0
" @entity63 , who opposed @entity23 's favored proposal for a race riot memorial , agrees with the assessment			2
" there should be a memorial [ to the victims of the riots ]			2
the reality is , the fundamental standard of living for people in this city has gotten worse , it 's gotten much worse , since the trials			0
there are not enough jobs for people who need jobs			0
a monument is n't going to change that , " he said			0
@entity63 is skeptical the city has truly moved beyond its headline - grabbing past			1
but he says the campaign , no matter who wins , has revealed a level of local progress on that front that has surprised many @entity4 residents			1
" you travel the county , you travel the city , you travel the townships and most of the people want the same thing , " he said			0
" they want good jobs , a good education			0
they want to make sure they have decent health care			0
there 's not a whole lot of difference there in terms of what people 's needs are and wants are and desires are			0
" i think things may be changing here , in the process of changing			0
it 's like a lightbulb going on			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
