when you first hear his pitch , it defies logic : @entity5 , a 30 - year veteran of the @entity6 , campaigning for re-election as an agent of change			1
" if you want change , if you 're unhappy with the direction of this country , the candidate of change is the guy you 're looking at , " @entity10 told an audience at a @entity13 lunch here			1
72 - year - old @entity10 -- the top @entity6 @entity19 -- is running against a 35 - year - old @entity20 who has never had an elected job in @entity22 but he 's the change candidate ? well , if you 're a voter with an unfavorable view of president @entity26 -- and according to a new @entity27 , that 's about two - thirds of @entity29 voters -- @entity10 's argument has appeal once he explains it			1
he says the only real option for altering the balance of power in @entity22 is a @entity19 @entity6 takeover on @entity36 -- and putting him in charge			2
" the only thing they can do in 2014 to begin to change the direction of the country is to change the makeup of the @entity6 , " @entity10 told @entity27			1
" in this country , the way you change things is at the ballot box			0
and so there 's only one thing that can be done this year to begin to lead @entity53 in a different direction and it begins right here in @entity29 , " he tells voters on the stump			0
@entity10 wants to be @entity56 so badly he can taste it , especially after two straight election cycles of seeing the role within his reach , but snatched away largely because of bruising @entity63 fights and @entity19 candidate missteps			1
@entity29 @entity6 race is one the key ones this year i reminded @entity10 of the old joke about senators , that most of them look in the mirror and see the next president			1
" i never had that problem			0
i never had that affliction , " @entity10 chuckled			2
" you have always wanted to be the majority leader of the @entity6 , is that fair to say ? " i asked			1
" i would like to have the chance to be the majority leader of the @entity6 , yes , " he replied			1
toughest challenge in years but to lead the @entity6 , he has to win re-election first , and @entity10 is facing his toughest challenge in years in @entity83			1
@entity83 would be @entity29 's first female senator			2
currently @entity29 's secretary of state , she has a well - financed campaign , thanks to the national implications and importance of her race			1
she 's gotten high - profile help from former president @entity90 , a family friend			0
in many ways she is running a textbook campaign for a challenger trying to unseat an entrenched incumbent , especially a @entity20 versus @entity19			0
she paints @entity10 as out of touch with the folks back home , and the personification of @entity22 dysfunction			2
" i do n't know whether to call sen. mcconnell sen. @entity103 , sen. gridlock or sen. shutdown , " @entity83 says to a crowd gathered for a political picnic in @entity102			2
" what i do know is that he 's not working for @entity29			0
@entity29 is all ready for someone whose vocabulary goes beyond the word ' no. ' when it comes to increasing the minimum wage and giving hardworking @entity114 a fighting chance , @entity5 says no. @entity29 is ready for a senator who says it 's not just a minimum wage , it 's a living wage			0
when it comes to the women of this state being treated equally , @entity5 says no , " @entity83 says			2
@entity10 : ' remember me ? i am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns ' that appears to be resonating with some voters here , even one who has supported @entity10 over the years			2
" we 're just tired of @entity10			2
his only objective is to -- anything @entity26 's done , he 's against it , " @entity102 voter @entity129 said			0
but others in the crowd disagreed , especially voters like @entity137 who dislike the president			0
" i believe the seniority he will hold in the @entity6 will be monumental , " @entity137 said about @entity10			1
" there are some issues with @entity26 i would like to see changed , and hopefully he can do that			0
" @entity83 ' biggest challenge is unshackling herself from @entity26 , who won only four of @entity29 's 120 counties in 2012			2
it 's not easy , when @entity10 's working so hard to link @entity83 to the president			1
" @entity5 , well , he wants to make this race about anyone but me , trying to tie me to every national figure that 's out there that disagrees with @entity29 's interests			0
@entity26 is n't on the ballot ; i am , " @entity83 told voters			2
@entity157 have been banking on the fact that the president may be unpopular here , but so is @entity10 -- he is well known , and not well liked			1
the trouble for @entity83 is that as she becomes better known , and put through the grind of this intense campaign , her favorable ratings are dipping , too			1
a strikingly stark contrast in styles like any candidate , @entity10 and @entity83 each have pluses and minuses , but these two have a strikingly stark contrast in style			1
@entity10 is the ultimate political tactician and old school , bring - home - the - bacon senator			1
when it was his turn to speak at the @entity102 picnic , @entity10 made a point of reminding residents here he secured $ 50 million to renovate the riverfront , which transformed the town			2
it 's the kind of earmark the tea party hates			0
he never would have spoken about it during his @entity19 primary fight , but it is front and center in the general election campaign against a @entity20			2
" i 'm proud i did it for you			0
it 's changed this community and we 'll do it again , " said @entity10 , not mentioning that the kind of earmarks that rebuilt the riverfront are now banned in the @entity6			1
but @entity10 's aides are the first to admit he is not a natural campaigner			2
he does n't connect in the grip and grin settings many politicians love			0
it 's not his thing			0
@entity83 , on the other hand , appears energized by pressing the flesh with voters			0
she moved around the @entity102 picnic introducing herself and talking to voters with ease			0
and on the stump she can project and deliver lines powerfully			0
but in interviews , she often appears stilted and scripted			0
case in point : when i asked @entity83 point blank for some " @entity29 candor " about how much of a drag the president is on her campaign , she replied with a generic talking point			1
" i think that @entity114 are seeing this race for what it is , a chance to actually move @entity29 forward in the right direction , " @entity83 said			0
bound to get very ugly this is expected to be the most expensive @entity6 race in history , north of $ 100 million			0
and the mud is already flying			0
@entity10 's campaign manager @entity232 abruptly resigned late last week because of a bribery scandal surrounding @entity235 's 2008 presidential campaign			1
@entity83 ' campaign is already pushing a web ad highlighting @entity232 's departure			1
but that may be because @entity10 's campaign released an ad of its own whacking @entity83 , accusing her of getting a sweetheart deal for her campaign bus -- brokered by her father , a prominent businessman and former state party chair			1
" they 're baseless , unfounded , bullying accusations from @entity5 , " @entity83 said of the allegations			0
and then there 's a secret audio recording that surfaced of @entity10 speaking at a @entity253 , vowing not to allow votes on @entity157 initiatives			1
it was released right before our interview , and @entity83 was eager to jump on it as @entity10 's " 47 % @entity261 moment			1
" " i think it shows the extent and the lengths he will go to pander to his party millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hurting @entity114 , " @entity83 said of the @entity10 audio			1
as for @entity10 , he brushed it off , because he has made it no secret he intends to block the president 's agenda			0
" i did n't say anything in the private meeting i have n't said publicly			0
@entity10 , the @entity157 and the limits of a secret tape that may be , but a muffled recording of a secret meeting with fat cat @entity19 donors is less than ideal for @entity10			1
these are end - of - summer stumbles for both candidates , in the marquee race of the year , bound to get very ugly .			0
