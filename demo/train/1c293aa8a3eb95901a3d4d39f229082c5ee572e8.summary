-- what started as a night drinking in the pub , turned into a morning riding a wild zebra			2
if it sounds like the kind of story generated by one - too - many beers and a vivid imagination , then there 's no doubting legendary horse trainer @entity11 's photos			1
yep , that 's a girl riding a zebra , all right			0
while other trainers usually take six to eight weeks to break in a horse , @entity16 equine expert @entity11 says he can do the job in just 20 minutes , as revealed in his new book " if horses could talk			1
" not just horses -- but donkeys , llamas , and a black - and - white striped animal better associated with the @entity27 savannah than the @entity29 countryside			1
" i 've done four zebras , " says the 54 - year - old , who has also broken race horses belonging to @entity16 's @entity32 , @entity34 ruler @entity33 , and @entity29 's national football team captain @entity35			1
" they said zebras ca n't be broken , they ca n't be ridden			1
but the first one was broken in 40 minutes			2
and the next one , which was completely wild , was broken and ridden away in 20 minutes			2
" wild ride in his 30 years in the business , @entity11 , who prefers to be called a " horseman , " says he has never encountered an animal that was not tameable			1
and that includes zebras -- the horse 's exotic equine cousin , which for centuries has roamed the @entity27 plains unsaddled			2
@entity11 made a boozy boast to that effect while drinking with friends at a local bar one night in 1996			1
little did he realize he was overheard by a woman who worked at nearby @entity60 in the south of @entity29			1
" i can get you a zebra , " she said			0
true to her word , the following morning @entity11 was confronted with two zebras -- one of them so flighty it dashed straight out onto the motorway , where it narrowly escaped oncoming traffic			1
these creatures were wild , even by the " horseman 's " standards			0
one kicked him so hard with its hind legs that it split his hand open			0
" zebras are at the bottom of the pecking order , " explains @entity11			1
" the lions and the hyenas are always on their backs			0
" so they 're sharp -- they have to react to sounds , smell , and sight very quickly or they 'll get eaten			0
they 're always on guard			0
" meet @entity94 nonetheless @entity11 set to work on the first zebra , called @entity94 , much like he would any other horse -- though rather than bending down to attach the saddle , he kept his distance by using a type of pulley system			1
he allowed @entity94 to race and rear around the pen until the three - year - old colt tired himself out to the point of compliance			0
when it comes to the details of @entity11 's taming technique however , the fast - talking trainer makes it sound so simple			1
" i just go into the pen , put a saddle on it , let it have a little buck and a rear , and then within two minutes it wants to come back to you , " says the grandfather - of - three , speaking by phone from his stables in @entity122 , in the south of @entity29			1
" it 's about reading the animal -- understanding it by the way it licks and chews , its ears and eye contact , how the body language is working			0
" once it starts to trust you , it does what you ask it to do			0
" peculiar pet once @entity94 was settled , a small jockey was needed for the zebra , which stood just 12 hands high			0
schoolgirl and keen rider @entity142 was enlisted for the task , and within 30 minutes was happily trotting the animal around the pen , much to everyone 's amazement			0
three more zebras followed @entity94 , eventually living on @entity11 's farm as among the most unusual pets the @entity29 countryside had ever seen			1
" you 'd call @entity94 and he 'd come galloping over , braying like he does , " @entity11 says			2
" he was like my dog , he was so friendly			0
" healing horses could @entity11 's magic touch come from a deeper , spiritual connection , given the issues of childhood trauma that he reveals in his book ? " i threw myself into horses , and i learned to stay away from people -- people hurt you , horses do n't , " says @entity11			1
" i think they understood that i might have come from a broken family -- they see the innocence in me , and i see the innocence in them			2
" today , the celebrity trainer " breaks in " anywhere between 600 and 800 horses a year -- not that he sees it that way			1
" break is a bad word , " says @entity11			2
" you do n't want to break the horse			2
if you went to school for the first day in your life , and you got knocked about and frightened , you would n't want to go back the second day			2
" it 's more about starting something new			0
' @entity186 ' is a nicer word i think			0
" a new start , not just for the horses -- but for the legendary " horseman " himself			0
