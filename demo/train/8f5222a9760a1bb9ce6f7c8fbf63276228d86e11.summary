@entity0 -- the failure of @entity4 engines on four jet aircraft overseas during the past two years has prompted the @entity6 to issue an " urgent " recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on @entity11 aircraft			1
none of the incidents resulted in crashes , injuries or fatalities			0
but in all four cases , engine parts penetrated the engine housing			0
such " uncontained engine failures " are particularly dangerous because flying engine parts could puncture fuel or hydraulic lines , damage flight surfaces or even penetrate the fuselage and injure passengers			0
at issue are @entity29 jet engines , older engines found on a small number of jets			1
@entity34 officials said 373 of the engines are in service in the @entity11 , on a fewer , but unknown , number of planes			1
the engines are used on some @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , md - 10s and @entity11 @entity45 kc - 10s			1
a @entity4 spokeswoman said most of the engines are used on cargo planes			1
on four occasions , the @entity6 said , a rotor imbalance caused rotor disks to fail , leading to the uncontained engine failures			2
@entity34 spokeswoman @entity53 said the @entity34 is aware of the problem and issued a rule in march requiring inspections of the engines within 50 flights , and repeat inspections every 175 flights thereafter			1
it also is working on a rule that would add testing of the rotor disks for cracks			0
but on thursday , the @entity6 issued its urgent recommendation , saying the @entity34 should require inspections every 15 flights until the disks can be replaced with improved parts			1
the @entity34 said the action " will maintain the safety of the fleet , " and that it will decide whether to alter the inspection schedule after completing examinations of the engines involved in the recent incidents			2
@entity4 spokeswoman @entity78 said @entity4 issued a service bulletin last august advising operators to inspect and monitor the engines			1
the @entity6 recommendation follows these four incidents : -- july 4 , 2008 : a @entity85 ( @entity85 ) @entity84 experienced an engine failure after takeoff from @entity88 , @entity89			2
-- march 26 , 2009 : an @entity90 , about 30 minutes after takeoff from @entity92 , @entity93 , experienced loss of oil pressure in one engine			0
the pilots shut down the engine and diverted to @entity99 , @entity100			0
-- december 17 , 2009 : a @entity101 was passing through 7,000 feet when the crew members heard a muffled explosion			0
with one engine losing oil pressure , the airplane returned to land at @entity107 , @entity108			0
-- april 10 , 2010 : an @entity109 experienced an engine failure while accelerating for takeoff at @entity112 , @entity113			0
the crew declared an emergency , aborted the takeoff , activated the fire - suppression system , and evacuated the airplane			2
the @entity6 is participating in or leading investigations of the four incidents .			2
