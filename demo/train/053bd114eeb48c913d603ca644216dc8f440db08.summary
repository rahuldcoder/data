the @entity1 may seem an unlikely candidate to lead a renewable energy revolution ; it does n't have much sun for solar power , it does n't have much space for wind power and it does n't have giant coursing rivers for hydro			1
it does , however , have thousands of miles of coastline and a lowering and restless sea whose tides ebb and flow with tremendous force			0
energy companies in @entity19 and @entity20 are seeing the potential from underwater turbines which tap a constant and predictable source of energy , are invisible and can produce as much electricity as a conventional wind turbine			1
if a test project in the fast flowing marine waters of @entity31 in the far north of @entity19 goes well , submerged turbines could eventually power as many as 400,000 @entity19 homes , according to the @entity19 - government backed scheme			1
predictable flow " the demonstration array at the moment is @entity38 or four turbines			1
hopefully this will be the catalyst for further investment , " @entity41 ceo @entity40 told @entity2			0
" we are looking to complete construction of that in 2016			0
" sea water is 832 times denser than air , which means the turbines can be smaller while producing a similar amount of energy to a wind turbine			1
the force of these tides also means the turbines can be placed closer together , taking up less space on the sea bed than an equivalent wind farm on land			1
apart from being invisible -- obviating a factor that has stalled many wind farm projects on land -- the marine turbines have the great advantage of tapping an energy source that does not rely on the weather			1
other renewables such as wind , wave , solar and even hydroelectricity depend in large part on seasonal and climatic features , tidal turbines , meanwhile , get two regular tide changes a day			1
" we can forecast over the next 100 years pretty accurately -- we know when the power 's coming , " he said			1
scrap metal as an anchor the plan is for the stands for the turbines to be lined up 525 feet ( 160m ) apart and weighted to the sea bed with scrap metal			1
with a depth of 130ft ( 40m ) , @entity40 says that vessels would have a clearance of about 8m , plenty , he says , for the small craft that ply the four mile region			0
" these are really cut down versions of wind turbines , such that most of the electrical equipment is onshore so that if something goes wrong , we can get a @entity98 and drive to the substation rather than having to get a boat and pick them up			2
" that 's one of the core advantages of this technology			0
" other issues such as maintenance and corrosion have been solved , in large part , by using the advances in other technologies			0
" it makes use of a large knowledge base , for example the seals and solutions have been solved by propeller technologies on ships , problems of corrosion are well known from subsea structures like bridges or oil rigs			0
" what you 're seeing is nothing brand new , it 's just a lot of components coming together and i think that 's the beauty of it			0
" safe for sea life ? concerns over the impact on marine life were also raised during the planning process , but @entity40 said the simple fact is the turbines move so slowly -- at between 12 - 18 @entity139 -- that experts believe most sea life would be able to either ignore or get out of the way of the blades with ease			2
" we 've been working closely with institutions such as @entity147 and the @entity148 because we have diving birds in the area , " @entity40 said			0
" we have seals , we have whales , we have dolphins -- it 's beautiful up there			0
" he said undersea monitors have been logging the wildlife in the region over the past five years and that various groups now have a clear baseline of which animals populate it			2
" there has been a lot of work done in other parts of the world on how seals and whales interact with these turbines and they do actually get a bit curious			2
" but these rotations of the blades are quite slow in comparison with wind turbines and the theory is that they can just get out of the way			2
he said research had shown that most marine life avoids tidal surges when they are in full flow			2
" i can imagine seals dancing around them , but the only time they 'll be playing around them is when the flow is benign -- and that only lasts for about an hour and a half and at that time the blades are n't rotating			0
" we do n't want to be blas√© about it , but at the same time we have a high degree of confidence			0
" the immediate future of the energy source , he said , was looking good , with leases around @entity19 showing the potential to produce @entity197 -- more than twice the energy produced by an average - sized nuclear power plant			1
" the @entity1 has a good chance to develop and manufacture these turbines for world consumption in a beautiful part of the world which currently has a low gdp , " he said			1

energy companies in the @entity1 see potential from underwater turbines that produce electricity
the energy is *consistent* and predictable ; companies can model output 100 years in the future
@entity224 has placed four turbines in the north of @entity19 to tap the tidal power of @entity31
the energy source has the potential to produce @entity197 , the equivalent of two nuclear power plants
