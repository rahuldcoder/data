a spokesman for sen. @entity1 dismissed as " meritless " an ethics complaint filed wednesday by @entity3 that charges the majority leader improperly used his government - funded website and @entity8 account for partisan political purposes			1
at issue are @entity1 's ongoing attacks against @entity12 and @entity13 , the billionaire brothers who are spending millions through their organization @entity15 to defeat @entity17 candidates this campaign cycle			1
some of @entity1 's comments , which he has made in speeches on the @entity22 floor and elsewhere , also appeared on his senate.gov website and on his official @entity8 account			2
" @entity22 rules are clear : senators and their staffs are prohibited from using official resources for partisan , electoral activities , " said the complaint filed by @entity27 , the chairman of the @entity3 of @entity28			0
" @entity22 staff receive publicly funded salaries for the performance of official duties and no campaign or electoral activities should take place on @entity22 time , or using official @entity22 equipment or facilities			0
" " @entity3 ' blind obedience to the shadowy billionaire @entity45 is on full display today , " @entity1 spokesman @entity42 said in a statement			2
