-- the @entity2 tablet is a good - looking piece of hardware			1
like the proto - humans in " 2001 : @entity9 , " you 'll be eager to touch the monolithic object 's black , buttonless visage			1
but once you do , things get a little more complicated			0
the @entity2 's design exudes the same sense of finely honed " business chic " that @entity14 has perfected in its blackberry smartphones			1
but the @entity2 's software suffers from several missteps and oversights , especially in the drought of useful apps -- the very things that have made tablets such a hit -- and the lackluster performance of @entity26 's flash player			1
at a svelte 7.6 inches by 5.1 inches , the @entity2 is about the size of @entity29 's @entity28 , and considerably smaller than the @entity30 and @entity31			1
that may prove bothersome if you prefer watching videos and gaming on a larger screen			0
but in a trade - off for the small screen size , the @entity2 makes gains in portability			1
at just under a pound , long reading sessions do n't cause as much fatigue as they do with larger tablets , and the rubberized backing adds a pleasing tooth to the grip			0
you wo n't be worried about dropping it on the floor of the bus			0
@entity52 is banking that those who bemoan the loss of screen real estate will use the tablet as a media hub for larger devices			0
you can drag and drop media files from your desktop to the @entity2 the same way you 'd move files to a usb flash drive			1
you can also transfer files wirelessly over your local network			0
once the @entity2 is loaded up with movies , use the hdmi - out to connect the tablet to a television and watch everything in full 1080p on a 16:9 wide screen			1
on both the big screen as well as the @entity2 , videos look damn good			1
and they sound good , too			0
the @entity2 's two speakers flank the screen 's face horizontally , projecting sound outward toward your ears			1
the quality is surprisingly clear for the size of the speakers			0
there 's no tinniness or distortion , even with the volume cranked			2
there are no buttons on the face , but there are four along the top edge : a @entity94 , a two - way volume rocker and a power button			0
they 're unobtrusive , though sometimes to a fault			0
it takes a noticeable amount of effort to push in the @entity103 button , which is frustrating if you want to turn the screen on or off quickly			0
in the absence of a home button , there 's a new @entity110 convention to learn : you touch the frame along the bottom of the screen and swipe up when you want to return to the home screen			1
touch sensitivity is very responsive , and the swipe controls work great			1
taking a note from @entity120 's webos , @entity52 brings multitasking to its @entity122 - based @entity121 , letting you switch back and forth between simultaneously running apps			1
by swiping a finger to the side of the screen , you can jump from the @entity129 video you were watching back to a paused game of @entity131 , without having to return to the home screen			0
also cool : the ability to multitask with apps running on a peripheral display			2
when the @entity2 is hooked up to an hdtv , you can watch video at 1080p on the big screen while browsing the web on the @entity2			1
or , you can show a presentation on a projector while swiping through your speaking notes on the tablet			0
be forewarned of resource hoggery , though			0
try running too many apps at once , and a low - memory notification will pop up in the left - hand corner telling you to cool it			2
the @entity2 comes loaded with 1 gb of @entity151 to protect against this , though on occasion when i ignored the warning long enough , my browser crashed			1
move closer to the software level and things get even stickier			2
any tablet debuting more than a year after the @entity157 's market - dominating @entity31 needs an edge			2
for the @entity2 , that edge is support for @entity160 , a feature that the @entity31 is famously lacking			1
@entity52 says it took over two years of working with @entity26 to bring @entity160 to its tablet			1
two years may not have been enough			0
during a round of " @entity165 , " gameplay bogged down whenever the animation got intense			0
every time i tried to access a @entity160 game on @entity171 , the browser crashed			0
yes , every single time			0
say goodbye to your well - tended crops , @entity174			0
@entity52 delivered several software updates during our tests , showing that the company is still ironing out bugs			2
flash stability increased with each update , and may well be even more stable by the time the @entity2 ships on april 19			1
but the fact that a marquee feature is strapped with such stability problems so close to the ship date is troubling			0
another glaring flaw is the @entity2 's complete lack of native e-mail , contacts and calendar apps			1
want those apps ? log on to your @entity194 account with the browser			2
@entity2 smartphone owners can access e-mail on the @entity2 after installing @entity200 app , which connects the phone to the tablet by @entity203 , but we were n't able to test this feature			1
if you do n't have a @entity2 phone , you 're out of luck until summer , when @entity52 says a future software update will bring native clients to the @entity2			1
also worth considering is the relatively paltry selection on @entity2 's @entity211 , which contains roughly 3,000 apps			1
by comparison , @entity157 and @entity214 's app inventories number in the hundreds of thousands			2
and some of the biggest apps -- @entity171 , a @entity194 client , @entity218 , @entity219 -- are conspicuously absent			2
clicking on the @entity171 " app " icon on the desktop brings up a web browser and loads the @entity171 website			0
@entity52 has announced that an @entity226 app player will be available on the @entity2 , which should bolster the number of available apps			1
but any @entity226 apps ported to the @entity2 must be vetted by @entity52 before they can make it into the store			1
under casual use conditions , the @entity2 's battery held up for close to eight hours , which is on par with both generations of the @entity31			1
with heavy use of flash - based sites ( when they functioned ) and 1080p video - watching , the @entity2 's battery hung in there for an impressive 5Â½ hours			1
it 's important to note that this is a @entity241 only version of the @entity2 , and that the battery life may be different once @entity52 releases the promised @entity243 for the big three @entity245 carriers			1
expect those to roll out beginning this summer , though no pricing details have been released on the @entity249 models yet			0
the bottom line : it 's a well - constructed device with great media - viewing capabilities , solid hardware specs and a price on par with the current tablet market			1
but with serious gaps in key areas like app selection and @entity160 stability , you may want to think twice before picking one up			0
@entity264 design appeals to the @entity265 in you			0
media is a joy with a brilliant display , great sound and an hdmi output			2
two cameras : one on the front , a better one on the back			0
supports tethering to @entity2 phones			2
comes with office - productivity apps that can read and edit @entity280 files			2
app multitasking is innovative and intuitive			0
@entity52 's @entity284 - based browser is about as stable as your bipolar uncle			2
no native e-mail , calendar or contacts apps			2
you 'll need to install a driver before you can connect it to your pc or @entity295 , sorta			0
