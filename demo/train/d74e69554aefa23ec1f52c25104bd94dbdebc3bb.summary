-- the publicity whores are back			1
ok , they never really leave			2
we are able to avoid hearing from them for periods of time , but unfortunately , they always reappear -- typically when they have a book to sell or a new tv show to kick off or maybe when they feel ignored			1
this week , a handful of them crawled out from their subterranean colony			0
i wo n't even identify these @entity18 of @entity19 by name			1
they do n't deserve the attention			1
but we are all painfully familiar with them			0
they are a modern - day @entity25			0
their primary purpose is to elevate their own power or glory without regard to truth , justice or the @entity36 way			1
why ca n't we simply ignore them ? why ca n't we turn the other cheek and move on ? these people are like rashes : the more you scratch them , the worse they get			1
but when you ignore a rash , it usually goes away			0
do we really need to hear another ridiculous or dumb comment from them ? such as the millionaire with the grotesquely inflated ego and the equally grotesque hairstyle that looks as if a @entity51 has been stapled to his scalp , the one who offered $ 5 million to see president @entity55 's college transcript			1
or the former governor who was once stumped by the question " what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read ? " there 's also the smug comedian / host of a weekly cable talk show who has called the above publicity - driven politician vile names , including the " c - word , " maybe as an effort to keep himself in the news			1
and , of course , who can forget the radio talk show host who infamously stated in the days before @entity55 was sworn in as our president : " i hope he fails			0
" plus , there 's a b team of media bloodsuckers who are just about personal profit at any cost			1
in fact , one of the stars of this bush - league team publicly used the word " retard " twice this week to describe @entity55			0
why use that word ? perhaps it 's because , as of the writing of this article , her new book is floundering at no. 199 on @entity97 's sales list			2
opinion : @entity100 's comment insults black americans in contrast , the statements made by people in power -- or those seeking power -- about their political stances ca n't be ignored , even if they sound as extreme as the publicity whores			1
a recent example is when @entity113 @entity112 candidate @entity111 stated , " even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape , that it is something that @entity117 intended to happen			0
" these words were not said by @entity111 in the hopes of personal profit or to inflame passions like those desperate for publicity			0
rather , they offer a glimpse into his true feelings on the issue of rape and abortion			0
the media should cover this extensively so as to better inform voters			0
but too often , the media tend to follow big personalities who seek the spotlight			1
these publicity - seekers are like vampires who , instead of needing blood , must get attention to survive			2
it 's in their dna			2
they will still subject someone to their stream of nonsense			0
it could be an unlucky person on line behind them at @entity152 , an unsuspecting taxi driver or anyone who stops for a few seconds to tie their sneakers on the sidewalk			0
next time we hear these people spew their vile garbage , let 's collectively ignore them			1
let 's not become outraged or demand apologies			2
let 's go on with our business , and maybe -- just maybe -- the media will follow suit			1
recently , i noticed a scab covering a small cut on my hand			0
when i picked at it , it became bigger and took up more of my attention			2
but when i left it alone , it healed			0
it disappeared without a trace			0
let 's hope the same happens with the publicity whores			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1
