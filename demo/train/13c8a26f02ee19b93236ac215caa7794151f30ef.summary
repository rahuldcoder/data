@entity1 , @entity0 -- one of @entity4 ' favorite stories to tell is about the time he was pulled over for speeding			0
as countries and companies plan to go to the moon , a debate heats up on lunar property rights			1
@entity4 , who had been in @entity1 on business , was driving home through the @entity0 countryside when a police officer stopped him and wanted to know two things : was @entity4 aware of how fast he was driving ? and , what was his profession ? it turned out the response to the second question would help @entity4 resolve the first : " i said , ' i sell land on the moon , ' " said @entity4			2
" and [ the police officer ] said , ' do you know , my wife has bought some of that			0
' " the answer to the first question was subsequently forgotten			0
@entity4 , who describes himself as the " @entity30 to the @entity31 , " is the owner of @entity32			0
he claims to have sold around 300,000 acres of moon land since he and his wife , @entity34 , founded the @entity36 - based company eight years ago			2
one - acre plots of lunar turf go for about $ 40			2
as proof of purchase , new property owners receive a silver tin containing a personalized " @entity43 " and a moon map with a tiny black x marking their tract 's approximate location			2
most of the land @entity4 sells is in the northwest , in an area known as @entity52 , or @entity52 -- a desolate lava plain formed by volcanoes billions of years ago			0
" i know the @entity55 are [ selling ] further east , " he said			0
@entity4 received his license to sell lunar land in the @entity31 from @entity43			2
in 1980 , the @entity59 - based entrepreneur claimed ownership of the moon after finding what he calls a loophole in the 1967 @entity65 @entity64 , which forbids countries from owning the moon but , according to @entity68 , does not forbid individuals from owning it			1
@entity68 , who estimates he has sold over 500 million acres of moon land , said he immediately filed a " declaration of ownership " with the @entity65 along with the @entity72 and @entity74 governments			1
after 28 years , the moon mogul still has not received a reply			2
" i have never heard from them on that note ever , " @entity68 told @entity2 in a phone interview			0
while the @entity65 may have ignored @entity68 's lunar land claims for almost three decades , it is unlikely the organization will be able ignore what could soon become a question of increasing international importance : who , exactly , does own the moon ? " at some point the world community needs to come together and draft some new convention or treaty , " said @entity90 , director of the @entity91 and @entity92 in @entity93			1
" it is an open wound that needs to be healed			0
" @entity90 pointed out that at the time the @entity65 drafted the @entity64 , there were only two spacefaring nations -- the @entity72 and the @entity102			1
now there are over a dozen			0
and many of them , including @entity107 , @entity74 , the @entity72 , @entity108 and @entity55 , want to go to the moon			1
@entity111 , for example , recently announced plans to return by 2020 , eventually building a permanent base on the lunar surface			2
the @entity115 , @entity115 , has confirmed similar intentions			0
the burgeoning commercial space sector is also casting its gaze towards @entity120 's only natural satellite with companies considering everything from mining the lunar surface to building extraterrestrial resorts on it			1
" it is quite a complicated issue because it is international law we are dealing with , " said @entity126 , chief of the @entity127 of the @entity65 's @entity128 in @entity129			1
there are five treaties that govern international affairs in space , said @entity126			2
two of them -- the @entity138 and the 1979 @entity139 -- deal with lunar law			1
the @entity64 provides a legal framework for the international use of space for peaceful purposes , including the moon and other celestial bodies			1
widely considered the " @entity148 of space law , " this treaty lays down the fundamental principle of non-appropriation and that the exploration and use of space shall be the province of all mankind			0
according to the treaty , states bear international responsibility for national activities in space , including by non-governmental entities			0
the @entity64 says governments can not claim ownership of the lunar surface and that stations and installations on the moon shall be open to others , said @entity126			1
the @entity139 builds upon the @entity64 but also says that any natural resources found on the moon are part of " the common heritage of mankind " - in other words , they must be shared			1
while 98 nations , including all the major spacefaring ones , have ratified the @entity177 , only 13 countries have approved the @entity139 -- @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 , to name four			1
but @entity126 said this does not mean the other 179 countries that have not ratified the @entity139 are free to make a lunar land rush			1
" they are still bound by the fundamental provisions [ of the @entity64 ] , " he said , adding that " when enough states of the world have ratified a treaty , and it becomes binding , then certain fundamental provisions become binding even on states that have not ratified it			1
" @entity193 , a space analyst at @entity196 's @entity195 , said he is not so sure the @entity65 's treaties provide an adequate answer to the question of lunar property rights			1
" these treaties do n't really have any teeth to them in terms of enforcement , " said @entity193			0
" they are agreements on principle			0
" instead of focusing on who owns the moon , the international community needs find ways to incentivize future business activity on the moon by guaranteeing that rights to land and resources will not be preempted by competing interests , said @entity193			1
" owning property is not the issue , the issue is finding a mechanism for businesses to make a fair return on their investment , " he said			0
" otherwise there is no point in investing			0
" but first , @entity193 said , there also needs to be a guarantee that there is something on the moon worth investing in at all			0
" my feeling is until we know what is there , we should n't mess with it , " he said			0
