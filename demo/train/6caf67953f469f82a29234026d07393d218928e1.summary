@entity0 , @entity1 -- in this tough economy , a steady paycheck is a big blessing			1
with the unemployment rate above 10 percent , @entity6 are finding new ways to help each other out			0
for many , it 's through their faith			0
" we did say our prayers , " @entity12 said			0
" i pray to @entity15 even now			0
he is our patron of workers			0
i still pray to him every day			0
" yet believers like @entity19 are doing more than praying			0
they 're getting help in their job searches from houses of worship			1
and religious institutions are answering the call : houses of worship nationwide have offered job - finding help			1
@entity19 has looked for help in finding a job through a network created at @entity33 in @entity0 , @entity1 , just outside @entity34			1
the church has reviewed résumés and arranged meetings between job - seekers and company representatives			1
it also has hosted speakers who have discussed financial planning and interview techniques			0
similar programs have received attention in places such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
@entity15 's started helping unemployed members last year after a priest contacted @entity52 , a parishioner with a background in career management			1
@entity52 says the priest told him , " we 've been getting a lot of phone calls from people that are unemployed and really hurting ... and we 'd like you to come to a council meeting to talk about what we should do			1
" by may of last year , @entity64 was born			1
" when you 're helping people ... they 're getting what they need , " @entity52 said			0
" they 're getting jobs , the hope they need			0
" @entity74 , another founding member , found himself out of work in the early part of 2009			0
his involvement with the @entity64 paid off , literally , with a job			1
" it 's through these different networking opportunities ... through your churches ... you get to meet people ... and potentially get positions , " @entity74 said			0
" that happened to me , where i was networking and actually found a position ... as a result of meeting people through the career network			1
" @entity74 says church - based career networks like his reach out in both a spiritual and practical sense for the unemployed , the under - employed and those seeking to re-enter the work force			1
" we offer review of résumés ... the opportunity to meet with department leaders or heads of companies ... discuss with them where individual career goals can go , " he said			1
" we also have featured speakers who help with financial planning , retirement funds , health benefits and also interviewing techniques ... looking at different market shares			0
" @entity110 helps organize biweekly sessions			0
when she signed on , @entity110 was a stay - at - home mom looking to re-enter the work force			2
she 's now employed and using her job skills in training and instructional design to help others find work			2
" my motivation was seeing how tough the job market was and how many people across every industry , every income level , were feeling the job loss and the unemployment situation , " @entity110 said			2
she says networking opportunities , like those offered through @entity127 , are key , and houses of worship may offer a more comfortable environment			1
" there is something about going to a church , " @entity110 said			2
" personally , i feel like it 's more welcoming			2
" @entity6 overwhelmingly support government funding for religious groups to provide social services like job training			2
nearly nine years after former president @entity139 unveiled his faith - based initiative , 69 percent of @entity6 say they favor the idea , according to a recent survey by the @entity143			2
sixty - eight percent believe that people providing the services through houses of worship would be more caring and compassionate			1
@entity19 not only supports the idea , she got involved a few months ago at @entity149 's as both a volunteer and a job seeker			1
" my last position , i was in for seven years and not really comfortable with networking , so i thought the church would be a great place to start ... and get contacts to possibly help me find employment , " @entity19 said			2
since then , @entity19 has moved to @entity158			0
she says she 's taking the hope , faith and job skills @entity127 provided and will probably join another job networking group at a local church , in her ongoing search for a steady paycheck .			1
