@entity0 -- the interpretation of complex legal verbiage is the @entity5 's bailiwick , but sometimes the outcome of a case falls upon the meaning of single word			1
the magic word in an appeal argued wednesday was " personal , " and whether it extends beyond humans to " artificial " entities like corporations			2
telecom giant @entity15 wants " personal privacy " protections applied to businesses , just as they have long been granted to individuals			1
at issue is whether corporate " personhood " extends to the @entity21 , which exempts the public release of government documents that invade personal privacy			1
the company wants material gathered by a federal agency during a consumer investigation to be kept secret			1
several justices seemed deeply skeptical of the company 's claims for relief			1
citing " dozens and dozens " of examples in a study of government bureaucracy , justice @entity33 said that " overwhelmingly , ' personal ' is used to describe an individual , not an artificial being			0
" " can you give me any examples in common usage where people would refer to the ' personal privacy ' of a corporation ? " asked justice @entity41			1
" it 's a very strange phrase to me			0
" but others on the bench were not willing to say personal privacy applies only to a single human being			1
the dispute began in 2004 when @entity15 found out it may have overcharged the federal government for the @entity56 program , which provides affordable internet and telecom access for schools and libraries across the @entity61			1
the company voluntarily turned over documents to the @entity64 , the agency charged with investigating the matter			2
months later , a trade group that included some of @entity15 's competitors filed a @entity21 request for all correspondence related to the @entity56 probe			2
the material included @entity15 memos , e-mails , invoices and employee names			2
the company said the material was exempt from public release , since it was collected strictly for " law enforcement purposes , " according to court filings , and it argued that disclosure would cause an " unwarranted invasion of personal privacy			1
" the @entity64 ultimately rejected the claims , saying the personal privacy exemption applies only to individuals			1
a federal appeals court reversed , finding for the corporation , and prompting the government 's @entity5 appeal			1
wednesday 's hourlong oral arguments featured several justices offering various examples of the extent to which " personal " privacy could ever be applied to the corporate theory			1
" for example , you could refer to personal jurisdiction over a corporation , could n't you ? " justice @entity101 asked the @entity103 's lawyer , @entity102			2
" i suppose families have rights of personal privacy , do n't they ? " added @entity104 , extending the term beyond individuals			1
@entity15 's attorney , @entity110 , told the court the issue is one of fairness			2
" all we are asking for and indeed all that @entity116 provided for is that the privacy interests be weighed against the public interest in disclosure			0
and what the @entity64 did here was to categorically exclude corporations from the protections " under federal law			0
" how does the commission , unaided by @entity15 , go through the papers and decide what would be embarrassing for an @entity15 employee , as distinguished from the corporation ? " @entity110 said e-mails could be exposed to public view showing corporate officers who " may engage in a frank exchange about the competence and intelligence of a would - be regulator of the corporation			1
or disparaging comments " about a business competitor , something that should be protected under privacy laws			0
" why does that relate to the corporation 's privacy interest ? " replied @entity41			2
" anything that would embarrass the corporation is a privacy interest ? " the @entity15 lawyer ran into further trouble when he tried to mince words -- suggesting that because " person " is defined to include a corporation in the relevant federal statute , the term " personal " also must apply			1
" i tried to sit down and come up with other examples where the adjective was very different from the root noun , " said @entity104			0
" it turns out it is not hard at all			0
you have craft and crafty			0
@entity161 does n't have much to do with craft			0
right ? i mean , you have a pastor and pastoral			0
same root , totally different			0
so i do n't think there 's much to the argument that because ' person ' means one thing , ' personal ' has to be the same relation			0
" beyond interpreting the meaning of personal privacy , the court may also have to wrestle with defining or redefining " corporate , " either as an association of citizens with extended , shared rights , or as a state - chartered entity with its own separate , competing rights apart from those of its members			1
such interpretation was key to the high court 's controversial campaign finance ruling a year ago , in which the conservative majority gave corporations greater power to spend freely in federal elections , overturning a federal law that had imposed strict limits			0
the court said corporations had to be treated as " persons " when it came to campaign spending , with the same power as individual donors			0
now the dispute is whether corporations enjoy similar protections in the privacy context			0
liberal groups have complained that the @entity104 court has been overly friendly to businesses in recent rulings , at the expense of individual consumers			0
they want a blanket rule exempting corporations from personal privacy protections			1
" @entity116 did not and could not imbue corporations with the dignity interests that @entity21 protects when it shields living , breathing human beings from invasions of personal privacy , " said @entity214 , chief counsel of the @entity215			1
" a corporate charter can not blush or feel embarrassed by @entity21 's policy of transparency , " a number of media organizations have also filed briefs in support of the @entity229 administration , saying the @entity21 has been a powerful tool to hold governments and corporations accountable			0
coalitions of business groups , including the @entity61 @entity235 and the @entity236 , are backing @entity15			2
justice @entity237 is not participating in the case because she had handled the appeal as the administration 's solicitor general before being nominated to the high court last year			0
the case is @entity64 v. @entity15 ( 09 - 1279 )			2
a ruling is expected in the next five months or so .			0

the @entity5 mulls whether a corporation has " personal privacy "
@entity15 says yes , as it tries to *prevent* release of documents gathered by a federal agency
some justices seem skeptical as they hear oral arguments
