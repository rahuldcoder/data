-- you can keep them for only a week			2
but @entity3 is handing out free @entity4 , along with a trial run of its cellular service , in the latest in a string of unorthodox promotions for the no. 4 wireless carrier in the @entity11			1
through " @entity3 @entity13 , " curious consumers will get an @entity15 loaner and seven days of unlimited data to check out the service			1
starting monday , people can sign up for the program online			0
if they 're not impressed , they can drop the phone off at any @entity21 , at no charge			0
people must give @entity3 a valid credit card number to get a phone			2
if they return a cracked or water - damaged phone , they 're billed $ 100			0
if they do n't return the phone at all , they 're billed $ 700 , plus tax			0
in trying to crack the @entity30 , @entity3 has taken on the mantel of " @entity32 " under the guidance of ceo @entity34 , a nontraditional business executive if ever there was one			2
witness his slightly off - color quote promoting the new deal : " the way this industry forces @entity11 to buy wireless is completely , utterly broken			0
i 'm here to tell you there 's a better way , " he said			0
" while the carriers ask you to buy blind , the @entity32 gives you transparency			0
our network kicks ass , and now people can experience for themselves what a data - strong network can do with @entity3 @entity13			1
" since march 2013 , @entity3 has eliminated binding contracts and launched deals like @entity59 , which lets customers upgrade phones twice a year for a modest fee instead of once every two years			2
on wednesday , the carrier also announced that it would let customers stream unlimited music via @entity66 , @entity67 and other services without it counting against their data plans			1
and that 's in addition to @entity73 , known for sporting a pink @entity3 t - shirt under a suit nearly every time he 's in public , engaging in stunts like crashing @entity80 's private concert for developers at the @entity82 in january			1
this newly aggressive push comes even as @entity84 , the third - place @entity11 carrier behind @entity80 and @entity85 , is reported to be working on a plan to buy out @entity3 for as much as $ 20 billion			1
in fairness , similar rumors have swirled for several years			0
if a deal does go down , it looks like @entity3 is ready to keep thumbing its nose at @entity84 and other rivals right up to the moment the papers are signed .			1
