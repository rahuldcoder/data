-- the @entity2 @entity1 is considering sending federal veterinarians in @entity4 across the border into @entity6 to inspect cattle , a practice that ended years ago over safety fears			1
government workers have come out against the plan , confounded as to why they would be required to work in a @entity6 state under a travel warning by the @entity14 because of carjackings and robberies			2
the @entity1 conducted a security assessment on the @entity6 installation friday , but have not made a final decision on whether to send veterinarians from the @entity21 , or @entity21 , to work there			1
the facility is located near the @entity24 , a rural international crossing near @entity25 , @entity4 , that connects to the @entity6 state of @entity27			0
@entity6 accuses @entity2 in border shooting according to its most recent travel warning , the @entity14 urges @entity2 citizens to " defer non-essential travel " to the @entity27 , except for the major hub of @entity33 , which itself carries other warnings			0
the closest major city to the facility is @entity25 , @entity6 , a place known for the drug cartel violence that has been recorded there			0
a lawyer for the government veterinarians along the border said the federal workers are unwilling to work there because of fears of being kidnapped or killed			1
" nobody is holding a gun to their head ... yet , " said @entity47 who represents the @entity48 , which opposes the plan			0
" but @entity1 officials have told them in no uncertain terms that when they 're assigned there they better go or there are going be serious consequences to their careers , such as losing their jobs			0
" in response to @entity47 ' claims , the @entity1 said it is not forcing employees into the assignment and that they will not send federal workers into an area not considered safe by the @entity14			1
" we are committed to making sure our employees fully understand the risks and are properly prepared to do their jobs , " the @entity1 said in a statement to @entity0			0
" @entity21 and the @entity2 @entity14 are currently conducting a security assessment of a new inspection facility , and once the site assessment is complete , we will determine our next steps			0
" until march 2010 , cattle inspections were routinely done in @entity6 , but due to the rise in drug cartel violence along the border , @entity2 authorities transferred inspections to @entity2 - based facilities			1
during inspections veterinarians are tasked with clearing the cattle for fever ticks , hoof and mouth disease and other illnesses			2
" the real question is , why would ( the ) @entity1 even be taking a chance ? how much risk is acceptable to place its civilian employees into for even the slight convenience of having the animals inspected in @entity6 ? " @entity47 said			1
decision makers at @entity1 are not bad people , @entity47 said , " but they 're making a bad decision , or they 're being pressured to make a bad decision , even though they may deny it			2
and these folks down there on the border are saying , ' i 've been loyal to this agency , why are they doing this to me ? ' " between 10,000 and 20,000 @entity6 cattle are imported into the @entity2 each month , according to the @entity1			1
