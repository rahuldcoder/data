@entity0 -- now goalkeeper for the @entity6 , as a child growing up in @entity4 , @entity2 could only dream of being a professional footballer			1
at the age of 14 @entity2 was sent to study in the unfamiliar surroundings of @entity0			1
but his passion for football followed him across the @entity12			0
" when i moved from @entity4 to the @entity13 in 1997 , i did n't know that in the @entity13 they played soccer -- all i thought is basketball or whatever , " he says			1
" so coming here and seeing that soccer is well developed here , i went to high school			1
" @entity2 's shot - stopping talents started flourishing in his new environment			1
he soon made a splash on the local football scene as a talented goalie while playing in high school			1
" in the @entity13 , education can open the doors of any opportunity that you want , so when i went to high school , people started seeing , ' oh this guy has some talent , this guy can make it			1
' " in 2005 he fulfilled his dream of competing at the top level by signing for @entity13 @entity41 ( @entity41 ) team the @entity43			1
these days he sports the red and white colors of the @entity6 , whose fans have taken him to their hearts			2
on match days , a certain catch phrase can often be heard echoing around the team 's imposing stadium : " it 's @entity52			2
" it 's a phrase @entity2 lives by , defining his attitude toward both football and life			1
" the way i see it , the way i kind of come up with it ( is to ) be the best on the field , " he explains			0
" whatever you do in life , as long as it 's positive , it can be @entity52			2
" " try to do everything at your max so after , later on , you do n't regret anything			0
that 's why @entity52 is all about ( being ) positive			2
" @entity2 says he 's developed a special relationship with his team 's fans : " as soon as i step on the field ... you can hear it			1
' what time is it ? it 's @entity52			2
' and that really makes me feel like , ok , these guys are on my side , they really believe in me			0
" i make sure i give them a good show so every time they come , they know it 's going to be @entity52			0
" now a teammate of @entity90 football legend @entity89 , @entity2 says he cherishes the moments he 's on the same field as some of the sport 's biggest names			1
" @entity89 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 -- all those guys that back in the day i used to sit and dream and watch those guys play , now we 're in the same field , playing with those guys , or against them , " he says			0
" i think that 's a dream come true			0
any soccer player would love to have that opportunity			0
" @entity111 's eye - catching performances in the @entity41 have also earned him a place in @entity4 's national team			1
" i represent it with pride , with honor , " he says			0
" i want to serve the country the best way possible , which is playing soccer			0
" in 2007 he found another way to help his country on a deeper level , with the creation of the @entity124 , which provides after - school football training for some 60 children , and organizes matches for them at the weekend			1
but @entity2 says that only top students are accepted by the academy			2
he wants the young athletes to understand that while few of them will have the chance to be professional footballers , their education can take them anywhere			0
" i tell them , once you get your education , anything is possible , " he says			0
" even if you do n't become a professional soccer player , you can become the next president			0
" if you get your education , you can travel , you can read , you can do everything you want to do , and you can carry yourself in a way that they say , ' this guy is professional all the time			0
