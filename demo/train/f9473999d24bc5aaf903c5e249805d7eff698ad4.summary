-- in 2005 , about two weeks after 52 people in @entity3 were killed in bombings targeting the @entity7 city 's mass transit system , terrorists decided to strike again			1
a police cctv camera observes people walking in central @entity3			1
similar to the july 7 attacks , they chose the city 's transit system -- three subway trains and a double - decker bus -- as the targets			1
but this time , four homemade bombs stuffed into backpacks did not fully explode			2
about a day later , photographs of four suspects were broadcast on television			2
their images had been captured on surveillance cameras near the sites of the attempted attacks			1
the remarkable speed of that investigation was repeated in june this year when terrorists attempted to detonate two car bombs in @entity3			1
aided by surveillance cameras , @entity32 investigators began unraveling the plot later that day and tracked the suspects to @entity35 , @entity36			1
several suspects were soon arrested			2
police officials credited the " @entity44 " -- a network of thousands of surveillance cameras that line @entity3 's intersections and neighborhoods -- for providing license plate numbers , suspects ' image and other important clues in investigations			1
@entity50 , specifically lower @entity51 , the site of two terror attacks , will have a similar system in place by the decade 's end if it gets the needed funding			1
police officials say the surveillance cameras can help combat crime and terrorism , perhaps even deter it			1
civil liberties advocates say such systems are a threat to privacy rights and another step for a society creeping toward a constant state of surveillance			2
the implementation of the plan , called the @entity71 , will require about $ 90 million , @entity68 @entity67 said			1
it will cost about $ 8 million a year to maintain			0
the city so far has raised about $ 25 million			0
part of it has come from the @entity76 and the rest from city coffers			0
@entity67 said the money being spent on the system is well worth it			0
" the 1.7 square miles of lower @entity51 are arguably one of the most valuable and sensitive pieces of real estate in the world , " he said during a telephone interview			1
the area includes the @entity88 , the @entity89 , the @entity90 , and the site where the @entity92 once stood and where the @entity93 is being built			0
the system has four components : license plate readers , surveillance cameras , a coordination center and roadblocks that can swing into action when needed			1
the primary purpose of the system is deterrence , and then an investigative tool , @entity67 said			0
the license plate readers will be in place by the end of the year			1
the rest of the plan is scheduled to be completed during the next two years			1
@entity50 already has many cameras located in its airports , banks , department stores and corporate buildings			1
the city 's law enforcement uses them when needed as part of a public - private partnership , @entity67 said			1
such partnerships can be found in many cities across the @entity122 , including @entity123 ; @entity124 , @entity125 ; @entity126 , @entity127 ; and @entity128 , @entity129			0
@entity126 police officials told @entity0 the city had 500 cameras and crime was reduced by 17 percent in neighborhoods where they are located			1
" the feedback from the community has been fantastic , and in fact , most people want cameras in their neighborhoods , " said maj. @entity135 of the @entity136			1
@entity144 deputy chief @entity143 said the city had applied for federal funding to implement a surveillance camera system of its own			0
@entity124 has a public - private partnership in several of its neighborhoods that gives police access to cameras , he said			1
he recalled a drug deal being busted because someone monitoring a camera grew suspicious of two cars idling in a parking lot with their hoods up for a long time			0
" we feel that [ the cameras ] go a long way toward preventing crime , " he said			2
but @entity163 , who served for years with the @entity164 and its counter-terror operations , doubts the power of cameras to deter crime			2
" i do n't know of a single incident where @entity170 has actually been used to spot , apprehend or detain offenders in the act , " he said , referring to the @entity3 system			1
@entity163 now works for @entity173 , an international security firm			0
asked about their role in possibly stopping acts of terror , he said pointedly : " the presence of @entity170 is irrelevant for those who want to sacrifice their lives to carry out a terrorist act			0
" @entity67 disagreed , pointing out that it is practically impossible to know what has been deterred			0
" we do n't know acts that may have been planned that -- because of the surveillance and deterrence systems that are in place -- did not go forward			0
" @entity163 does believe the cameras have great value in investigation work			2
he also said they are necessary to reassure the public that law enforcement is being aggressive			0
" you need to do this piece of theater so that if the terrorists are looking at you , they can see that you 've got some measures in place , " he said			0
privacy advocates said they are concerned about the possible abuse of surveillance power			0
@entity206 , the executive director of the @entity207 , said she was alarmed by the prospect of government and law enforcement officials having records of a person 's daily activities			2
" it was n't that long ago that @entity215 was up to his dirty tricks using government spying to interfere with lawful dissent , undermine critics and pursue an unlawful agenda , " she said			0
however , police officials repeatedly note there is no expectation of privacy in a public area and it is not a constitutional right			0
a majority of @entity122 said they approved of the use of surveillance cameras by nearly a 3 to 1 margin in a recently published @entity233 / @entity232 poll			2
@entity234 , a professor at @entity235 and the author of two books on privacy issues , said the poll reflected the fact that " the arguments against the cameras tend to be abstract , whereas people 's desire for security is understandable and immediate			1
" " but i think many people can understand life would be different in a world where , literally , government authorities could click on pictures of you at any point in the day and retrace your movements 24/7 , " he said			0
@entity206 said privacy is not a quaint notion despite a rapidly changing world			0
" technology is an unstoppable train , " she said			0
" the question is whether we can maximize the benefits and minimize the harms			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity265 contributed to this report .			2
