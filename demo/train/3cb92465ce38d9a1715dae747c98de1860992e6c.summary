-- here comes the @entity2 if you have n't heard about it already , you will			2
it 's the first smartphone produced by @entity5 under the company 's new @entity7 overlords			1
it claims to be the first smartphone made in the @entity11			0
and it comes buoyed by a wave of hype , a fat marketing budget , and no shortage of new leaks threatening to out the device before its official debut as early as next month			0
tech bloggers even took note last week when a leaked photo showed @entity7 chairman @entity23 chatting on what appeared to be a white @entity2 taken together , the leaks depict a phone that 's less about the hardware specifications and more about clever uses of sensors , customized features and hands - free voice commands			1
a new marketing video from @entity35 carrier @entity33 was leaked to the @entity36 last week -- it 's since been taken down by @entity38 -- and showed some of the phone 's unique features			1
you can activate the voice controls by saying " @entity44 " out loud , then ask for directions or give it other commands			0
it 's similar to @entity51 's @entity50 voice - assistant feature or @entity7 's existing @entity7 voice commands , except that you do n't need to press a button to activate it			1
active updates will push notifications to the phone based on your needs , location or time			2
@entity60 , ceo of @entity5 , said recently that sensors in the phone will anticipate users ' needs -- for example , letting it know when it 's being pulled out of someone 's pocket			1
finally , a twist of the wrist will trigger the @entity2 's camera -- another feature for people who hate applying pressure to buttons in order to turn things on			1
@entity77 has reported that customers will be able to customize their @entity2 phone in advance by choosing colors for the back and trim , adding engraving and uploading a photo so that the wallpaper is already personalized when the device arrives			1
great features , or just gimmicks ? so will all these bells and whistles be enough to set the @entity2 apart from other smartphones ? so far , analysts are n't convinced			2
" i do n't really think that there 's anything i 've seen so far that will really get the consumer crazy , " said @entity93 , an analyst at @entity94			0
" a lot of the things you see are more gimmicks			0
" the leaked features are n't entirely new , either			0
the active updates seem like an expansion of the @entity44 predictive search tool			0
currently available on @entity107 and @entity108 , it combines location and time information with data pulled from your search history , @entity115 account , and calendar to show information that 's relevant right then and there			0
for example , your boarding pass will be displayed when you 're at the airport			0
as for hands - free voice controls , @entity7 previewed this feature at its @entity127 developer conference in may , comparing it to the voice - activated computer on @entity129			1
to become must - have tools for consumers , these features must work extremely well lest they become more of an annoyance			2
if users like them , hands - free voice commands , active alerts and the camera shortcut could theoretically be rolled out in future updates to the @entity107 mobile operating system			1
then they would work on other phones that also have the right sensors , stealing the @entity2 's thunder			1
smartphones are constantly one - upping each other with incremental improvements -- higher - resolution screens , faster processors , pretty colors -- but experts say real innovation is stagnating			0
one of the few radically different features to hit the market of late is the 41 - megapixel camera inside @entity158 's @entity157 smartphone			1
smartphone consumers are still waiting for hardware improvements such as significantly longer battery life ( not just " it can last all day ! " ) , wireless charging or durable , droppable bodies			0
moto marketing if these new features are n't enough to make consumers flock to the @entity2 , the pricy marketing blitz @entity7 has planned might do the trick			1
according to the @entity169 , @entity7 will launch a $ 500 million international marketing campaign for the device			0
the company will likely emphasize that the @entity2 will be assembled at a new smartphone manufacturing plant in @entity174			2
@entity5 's news followed similar announcements by @entity178 computer maker @entity177 , which is building a manufacturing plant in @entity180 , and @entity51 , which has said it will begin manufacturing a @entity182 computer in the @entity11 this year			1
" it seems to be a trend but at the end of the day , consumers do n't care as much ( about where a phone is made ) , " said @entity93			0
" what 's going to be more important is the price and what the product is going to do			0
" @entity7 completed its purchase of the @entity194 - based @entity5 for $ 12.5 billion in 2012			1
the deal was done primarily to flesh out @entity7 's patent portfolio with @entity5 's 17,000 patents			1
but there was always the exciting potential for a smartphone partnership between the two tech giants			0
@entity7 makes the @entity107 mobile operating system , @entity5 makes handsets			1
in the flip - phone days of the early - to mid- 2000s , @entity5 was a leading phone maker with such models as its popular razr			2
@entity7 released its flagship @entity208 smartphone earlier this year , which is manufactured by @entity210 company @entity209			2
it 's possible that @entity5 could take over the manufacturing of the @entity208 devices in the future			2
the @entity5 name had a lot of cachet a decade or two ago , but it 's not clear whether that 's enough to inspire brand loyalty from today 's users			2
many consumers may have forgotten about them			0
either way , we 'll find out soon .			0

a recently leaked video shows some of the @entity2 's big features
the phone appears to have hands - free , voice - activated search and smart push - notifications
this is the first smartphone created entirely with @entity5 's new owner , @entity7
@entity5 will need to *wow* consumers to get back in the game
