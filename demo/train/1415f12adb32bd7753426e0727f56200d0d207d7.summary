" @entity127 : @entity165 named 2 millionth @entity132 ( @entity166 ) @entity127 : presidents and the @entity136 @entity168 : in an exclusive interview with the @entity170 of @entity171 , the @entity173 professor said the recent " climategate " e-mail scandal caused him to consider suicide			2
in those hacked e-mails , @entity168 expressed concern that global warming skeptics would discredit the work of climate change scientists and apparently suggested that it might be better to destroy scientific data rather than have it discredited , the @entity103 reported			1
when the e-mails surfaced before the @entity187 climate summit in december , the harsh reaction that was unleashed around the world took @entity168 by surprise			1

" sunday @entity103 : climate professor thought of killing himself what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			2
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0
