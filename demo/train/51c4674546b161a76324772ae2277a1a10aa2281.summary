-- the @entity1 issued a general travel alert for @entity1 in @entity3 on sunday amid concerns that @entity6 or related groups plan attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in the @entity10 city of @entity11			1
" @entity1 citizens should take every precaution to be aware of their surroundings and to adopt appropriate safety measures to protect themselves when traveling , " the notice from the @entity13 said			1
" we continue to work closely with our @entity3 allies on the threat from international terrorism , including @entity6			0
" the advisory is not meant to tell @entity1 to avoid travel , but to take " common - sense precautions " in case of trouble , @entity22 @entity21 told reporters sunday			1
" if they see unattended packages or hear loud noises or see something beginning to happen that they should quickly move away from them , " he said			0
the warning urges them to be cautious in public places like tourist sites and airports or while riding public transportation , and @entity1 should know how to contact the @entity1 @entity41 and consider registering their travel plans there , he said			1
in addition , thousands of @entity1 troops based in @entity45 were placed under a curfew friday night and were ordered not to wear their uniforms off base , according to an order obtained by @entity0			1
@entity21 said the @entity13 has issued travel alerts for @entity3 for " a variety of reasons " in the past , including the recent eruption of a volcano in @entity56 that snarled air travel across the continent			2
the @entity13 said worldwide travel alerts have been issued for @entity1 citizens in the past , most recently in early september after the pastor of a small @entity62 church threatened to burn copies of the @entity64 , the @entity65 holy book			1
previous alerts were issued after the 2004 @entity6 bombings of commuter trains in @entity70 's capital @entity71 and after the 2005 bombings of subway trains and buses in @entity75 , @entity76			0
@entity77 emerged last week that @entity79 intelligence officials were looking at information about a possible " @entity11 - style " attack in cities across @entity3 , and a @entity84 security source said saturday that intelligence related to such a plot was being looked at very seriously on both sides of the @entity88			2
@entity11 , @entity10 's financial hub , was the site of a three - day terror attack in november 2008 that left more than 160 people dead			0
ten men launched the carefully planned assault , targeting two major hotels , the historic @entity98 train station and a @entity100 cultural center			0
@entity21 would not comment on specific intelligence sparking the report , but said it followed a " cumulative " process			0
" we have been monitoring this carefully for at least several weeks , " he said			0
@entity107 , a former @entity13 counterterrorism expert told @entity0 sunday that the alert is " about the mildest thing they can say			2
" " the @entity13 is historically extremely cautious about these things , " he said			2
it does n't want to be accused of failing to warn @entity1 if they have some information about a possible attack beforehand , but @entity107 said the alert is less severe than a more formal travel warning involving concrete threats			1
a @entity1 official said saturday that the alert was prompted by the volume of intelligence on possible terror threats , rather than any new intelligence			1
at the @entity124 , spokesman @entity123 said president @entity127 " has been following the threat information on a daily basis			2
" " from the day we became aware of this latest plot , the president made clear we need to do everything possible to disrupt this plot and protect the @entity1 people , " @entity123 said			0
sunday 's alert " is responsive to the president 's direction that we spare no effort , " he said			0
a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said @entity127 met with members of his national security team friday night and saturday morning and received another briefing sunday morning			0
the official said @entity3 allies are " all in sync " with the @entity1 , " both in terms of our assessment of the threat as well as our shared conviction that governments have an obligation to keep their citizens informed of terrorist threats			1
" several @entity3 governments said sunday that they are not raising their already - high alert levels as a result of the latest reports			1
the @entity160 @entity159 said sunday that the @entity1 advisory was " in line with the general recommendations that we have addressed to the @entity160 population			1
" " the indications provided by the @entity1 authorities , in particular regarding terrorist threat in @entity3 are , of course analyzed , cross-referenced and where appropriate included in our national assessment of the threat , which still relies on a series of elements , " the ministry said			2
" the terrorist threat remains high in @entity160 , the alert level remains unchanged at level red			2
" @entity84 's @entity178 changed its travel advisory for @entity84 citizens in @entity160 and @entity45 from a " substantial " threat of terrorism to a " high " threat , but the @entity178 said it does not comment on intelligence matters and thus ca n't specify whether the change is related to the @entity1 travel alert			1
@entity45 's interior ministry said in a statement that the warning for @entity1 comes in light of recent threats and that @entity192 was informed by the @entity1 of the decision to issue the alert			1
@entity45 will analyze and evaluate the intelligence data coming in but will not be changing its current threat level at this time , according to the statement			0
also , a spokeswoman for @entity70 's @entity199 told @entity0 that the country will remain at @entity202 alert , which indicates a " high , probable risk " of a terror attack			0
@entity70 has remained at this stage since january of this year			0
@entity0 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
