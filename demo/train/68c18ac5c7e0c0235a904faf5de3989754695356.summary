the world number one exited at this stage in @entity8 thursday to @entity10 's @entity9 , beaten in straight sets , 7 - 6 7 - 5			1
fresh off his honeymoon and with his first child due , @entity1 went out to eventual winner @entity14 in @entity15 last week			2
he had hoped to improve in this week 's tournament , particularly as it 's the only one of nine masters 1000 events to elude him			1
@entity1 has been a four - time runner up on the hard courts in @entity23 and lost to @entity24 in the quarterfinals last year			1
this time around he did not even get to that stage , losing control of his match against @entity9 after losing a tight first set tiebreak 8 - 6			1

" it 's unfortunate , but it 's more than obvious i 'm not playing even close to what i 'm supposed to play			0
i have to keep on working and trying to get better for @entity44 , " added the @entity43			0

@entity47 , who has slipped to eighth in the world rankings after having back surgery in 2013 , eventually prevailed 6 - 7 6 - 4 7 - 6			0
@entity54 giant @entity24 had the match points on @entity47 's service as he trailed 5 - 6 in the deciding set , but could not capitalize on his opportunities			1
@entity47 took control of the subsequent tiebreaker and won it for the loss of just two points to go into the last eight			2
" i played very well , " @entity47 told @entity63			0
" this is a big win for me as he ( @entity24 ) plays extremely well here			0
" in the women 's tournament at the same venue , world number one @entity66 maintained her hopes of a first @entity8 title with a straight sets win over @entity75 's @entity74 6 - 2 6 - 2 to reach the quarterfinals			1
" i got an early break and just did n't let go , " @entity66 told the official @entity78 website			0
