@entity2 will delay the executions of seven death row inmates while searching for an adequate supply of drugs that complies with its new execution protocol , the state 's @entity0 said friday			1
that means the state will not carry out any executions in 2015 , the agency said in a press release			1
@entity2 said in early january that it will add thiopental sodium , a drug the state used for lethal injections from 1999 - 2011 , the department said			1
thiopental sodium and pentobarbital will be the only drugs used			2
@entity2 decided to stop using the two - drug regimen of midazolam and hydromorphone			2
that drug combination was last used in january 2014 on convicted murderer @entity26			0
witnesses said he convulsed and gasped about 10 minutes before he died			0
the @entity29 execution was closely watched because midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , had never been used in a @entity35 execution			0
@entity2 , like many states , was forced to find new execution drugs after @entity39 - based manufacturers banned @entity35 prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them , @entity45 - based @entity44 , which manufactures pentobarbital			1
the executions of @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 were rescheduled , according to the state .			0
