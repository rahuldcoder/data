@entity0 -- could the @entity3 bombing have been prevented ? that was the question legislators tried to answer at thursday 's @entity7 hearing , where the members of @entity9 asked a former senator , @entity12 's top cop and two experts on public safety about whether or not the intelligence community dropped the ball when they closed an investigation into one of the alleged @entity12 bombers before the marathon bombing in april			1
in opening the hearing , @entity21 rep. @entity21 of @entity22 , the committee chairman , said he feared " the @entity12 bombers may have succeeded because our system failed			1
we can and we must do better			2
" " we learned over a decade ago the danger in failing to connect the dots , " @entity21 said , referring to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			2
one of the alleged culprits in the @entity12 bombing , @entity31 , 26 , was investigated by the @entity34 after the agency received a tip from @entity38 authorities that the suspect could be radicalizing			1
@entity31 , along with his 19 - year - old brother , @entity40 , allegedly carried out the april 15 marathon bombing , which killed three people and left 264 people wounded			2
@entity38 intelligence services asked the @entity34 to investigate @entity31 in 2011 over a possible association with terror groups			2
they later also asked the @entity48			2
after receiving a tip , the @entity34 investigated @entity31 and , at the time , did n't find that he was engaging in any extremist activity			2
@entity12 bombing suspect 's body entombed in undisclosed location the @entity34 said a three - month probe turned up nothing derogatory about @entity31			1
the agency also said the @entity38 never responded to requests for more details			2
@entity31 's name was put on a @entity62 list to alert officials in case he left the country and the @entity48 also asked that his name be added to another file , the @entity69 list , which contains more than 700,000 names of suspected foreign and domestic terrorists			2
" based on what i 've seen so far , the @entity34 performed its duties , the @entity75 did what it was supposed to be doing , " president @entity72 has said			2
former sen. @entity77 , one of four witnesses at the hearing , told legislators that " though it would not have been easy , it was possible to prevent the terrorist attacks in @entity12			1
" @entity77 , who pushed for the creation of the @entity75 after the 9/11 attacks , said that post- 9/11 reforms have worked well to protect @entity87 , but they are not perfect			0
@entity89 commissioners @entity88 echoed @entity77 's sentiment			0
" the truth of the matter is nobody bats a thousand , " the commissioner said			1
" i think that as a nation we need to come to terms with it and do everything we can to prevent it , but also recognize that fusion centers and intelligence analysis and joint terrorism task forces are part of our future , " @entity88 said			0
" the world is a dangerous place and i think we need to recognize that and be prepared for it			0
" bomb suspect 's friend out on bail , released to mom @entity114 lawmakers in particular were critical of the @entity34 for not following up on its initial investigation of @entity31			0
in an exchange with @entity21 , @entity88 acknowledged that if he had known about the initial @entity34 investigation , he would have done things differently			0
" if you 'd had this information before the bombing , would you have done -- your police force and you -- would you have done anything differently , " @entity21 asked			1
" that 's very hard to say , " answered @entity88			0
" we would certainly look at the information , we would certainly talk to the individual			0
" @entity21 continued to press @entity88 , asking " but if you knew of a @entity38 intelligence warning that this man 's an extremist and made travel overseas and the fact that he did travel overseas and came back into the @entity87 , would that may not have caused you to give this individual a second look ? " " absolutely , " said @entity88			0
in apparent response to the idea that the @entity34 did not inform @entity12 police of the investigation , the bureau issued a statement thursday from @entity12 special agent in charge @entity145 , saying the information was available			1
the @entity89 has representatives on the @entity12 - area @entity149 , he said , and all task force members can access @entity151 , " a web - based counterterrorism incident management application that was launched in july 2004			1
" all task force members " are able to perform customized key word searches of @entity151 to identify relevant " assessment of suspects , he said			0
the assessment of @entity31 , one of about 1,000 conducted by the @entity12 task force in 2011 , was " documented " in the @entity151 database and " was thorough , comprehensive and fully compliant with law and policy , " @entity157 said			1
he noted that the task force is limited by law in " the types of investigative methods " it can use when there are no specific accusations			0
in addition to revisiting the @entity34 's initial investigation into @entity31 , @entity88 used his testimony to say the @entity3 bombing is further proof the @entity87 must strengthen vulnerable targets without violating civil liberties			1
before a hearing convened by the @entity7 , @entity88 submitted lengthy written testimony that touches on what worked and what did n't in the response to the @entity12 bombing			1
in that testimony , @entity88 argues that in order to defend soft targets -- locations that are not armored or are largely undefended -- law enforcement agencies need to " deploy more assets including technology , cameras , undercover officers and specialized units			1
" " it is clear after these events and other types of mass casualties such as those which have happened in our nation 's schools and colleges that we need to continue to harden soft targets , especially events that lend themselves toward large gatherings celebratory in nature , " @entity88 wrote			1
however , @entity88 cautioned against overstepping the bounds of security			0
" i do not endorse actions that move @entity12 and our nation into a police state mentality , with surveillance cameras attached to every light pole in the city , " he said			1
after the bombing , @entity88 became the face of the response			0
almost every legislator who asked questions in thursday 's hearing thanked him for his service			0
@entity88 used that high - profile response as proof that reforms to the nation 's video surveillance are needed , writing that in order to catch the bombers , law enforcement officials rely " almost exclusively on the support of our business partners to provide critical video surveillance along the finish line			1
" " i strongly support the enhanced ability to monitor public places , " he wrote			0
" this monitoring , which been upheld by the @entity236 , violates no constitutionally protected rights but gives police the ability to investigate and effectively prosecute			1
images from cameras do not lie			1
they can be viewed by a jury as evidence of what occurred			0
" in the hunt for the @entity31 brothers , surveillance video proved crucial			1
investigators solicited video from many of the business around the marathon route and used it to locate the bombing suspects			2
on april 18 , the @entity34 released surveillance - camera pictures of the brothers			2
the final 24 hours that paralyzed @entity12 although thursday 's meeting is the first congressional hearing on the @entity12 bombing , it certainly will not be the last			1
legislators in both the @entity263 and the @entity7 have expressed an interest in hosting experts to discuss what to learn from the terrorist attack			0
the @entity12 bombing saga began after the two bombs went off at the @entity3 finish line on @entity271 on april 15			1
hundreds of @entity12 law enforcement officers then began a gripping week long search for those who carried out the terrorist attack			1
late at night on april 18 , @entity276 police officer @entity275 was shot and killed on campus , allegedly by the bombing suspects			2
in the early morning of april 19 , the suspects allegedly hijacked a car in @entity281 and led police on a high speed chase through @entity281 and @entity284 , two @entity12 suburbs			1
in a shootout during the chase , the older @entity287 brother was wounded by gunfire			0
he later died at a hospital			0
throughout much of that day , hundreds of law enforcement officers went door - to - door on 20 streets in @entity284 , looking for @entity40			0
residents around @entity12 were asked by authorities to stay inside as the hunt continues for the suspect			1
in the early evening of april 19 , @entity299 discovered @entity31 , wounded , hiding in his boat			0
he alerted police , and after a tense standoff , police took him into custody			2
@entity40 , who was in serious condition at the time of his capture , is now stable and charged with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death			0
in addition to @entity31 , three 19 - year - olds -- @entity320 , @entity321 , and @entity322 -- were arrested in connection with the bombings			0
the three are accused of helping @entity31 after the bombing by taking items from his dorm room in an effort to keep them from investigators			0
@entity1 's @entity332 and @entity333 contributed to this report .			0
