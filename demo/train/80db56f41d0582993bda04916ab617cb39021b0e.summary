in july and early august , doctors at @entity1 of @entity2 diagnosed 15 to 20 children a week with serious respiratory infections -- a normal number for the summer months			1
then , pediatricians started to see more children who were having trouble breathing , more parents with worried looks on their faces			0
since school started , the hospital has seen an average of 100 cases a week			0
" we are seeing a double to quadruple increase in the number of children with respiratory infections , " says dr. @entity16 , hospital epidemiologist at @entity1 of @entity2			1
@entity24 ' ill - prepared ' for a pandemic , feds say more than 10 states around the @entity27 and @entity28 have reported seeing similarly high numbers of hospitalizations for children with severe respiratory illnesses			1
the virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a @entity37 , @entity38 , hospital , where about 15 % of the youngsters were placed in intensive care , health officials said			0
doctors say they think the increase is due to a bug called @entity44 , an uncommon type of enterovirus that seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma			1
list of states with @entity44 grows but nailing down the culprit , and tracking the number of cases , is easier said than done			1
children 's healthcare , like most hospitals around the nation , tests samples from children with respiratory illnesses to determine if they have a viral infection			1
but the tests do n't distinguish between the rhinovirus , which is the most common cause of the common cold , and enteroviruses , which can cause a variety of symptoms			0
once hospitals noticed this upward trend in severe respiratory illness cases , they requested help from the @entity72 in identifying the specific virus at fault			1
children 's healthcare of @entity2 is working with the @entity77 @entity76 to submit specimens to the @entity72 , which is already testing samples from states like @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
sick kids flooding er in @entity81 six states -- @entity87 , @entity37 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity38 and @entity90 -- have confirmed cases of @entity92			0
yet even in those states , not all samples came back positive for this specific type of enterovirus			0
nineteen of the 25 samples sent from @entity87 were @entity92 , said dr. @entity99 , medical director of infection control			0
@entity88 submitted 10 samples ; five came back positive			0
in @entity38 , 19 of 22 specimens sent to the @entity72 were confirmed to be @entity92			0
the problem is that there are more than 60 enteroviruses that are known to infect humans , according to the @entity72 ; these viruses cause an estimated 10 million to 15 million illnesses each year			2
symptoms can range from the sniffles to stomach issues to a severe respiratory infection			2
what parents should know about @entity114 - @entity44 the average healthy adult gets two to three colds a year , the @entity72 says ; children usually get more			1
they 're more at risk because their immune systems have n't had a chance to build up immunity to these common viral infections			2
the @entity72 does n't require state health departments to track these types of infections , since they are usually dealt with at home and patients recover with a little @entity128			2
so getting a firm count of the number of people infected -- or what other states may be at risk -- for @entity92 is difficult			0
" @entity72 is watching this situation closely , " the public health agency 's website states .			2

children 's healthcare of @entity2 has seen a " double to quadruple increase " in respiratory illnesses
more than 10 states have reported seeing high numbers of severe infections
doctors say they think @entity44 is to blame , but nailing the culprit wo n't be easy
