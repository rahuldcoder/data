no @entity0 is complete without a war on @entity0 , and this year it 's being fought on several fronts			1
@entity3 reported the @entity4 attacking @entity6 intransigence over the debt talks in a report with a section titled " @entity10 is no time to threaten @entity12			1
" that prompted the @entity15 to respond with the headline , " disagreeing with @entity17 can ruin @entity0 , says @entity4 report			1
" in the eyes of some liberals , the @entity6 have become the party of the @entity21			0
this must be news to conservatives who have always insisted that it 's the democrats who want to steal @entity0			1
to them , the war is being waged by liberal secularists against patriotic @entity31 @entity30 who want to celebrate the holiday loudly and publicly in the way @entity34 intended			2
@entity35 has hit out at those " miserable " atheists and @entity37 has gone after @entity39 gov. @entity38 for deciding not to host a @entity41 lighting ceremony			0
in other words , although the war on @entity0 phenomenon might have something to do with rising unbelief among @entity31 , more likely it reflects growing partisanship among politicians			1
in an age when nothing is so sacred it ca n't be used to hurt a political opponent , @entity0 is one more weapon that statesmen and stateswomen can use against each other			1
but the meaning of the war on @entity0 is actually bigger than partisan tomfoolery and is n't limited to right - wing fantasy , either			1
some of it exposes genuine tensions within @entity31 politics and society			1
take the decision of the @entity65 to end the tradition of erecting nativity scenes or other displays in @entity69			0
the right to display a scene was hitherto decided by lottery , and the previous winter season atheists won 11 out of 14 spaces , which they used to erect enormous critiques of @entity76			0
in response , locals lobbied the council to establish stricter guidelines about who could take part			0
the council decided that would be discriminatory , but it also did n't want to leave the system open to abuse by more offensive groups like neo-nazis			0
so it decided the displays would have to stop altogether			0
that decision was upheld in november by a federal judge			0
the local secularists were thrilled			0
" the free thinkers ... played the game of the religionists and they outsmarted them , " @entity94 told the @entity95			0
" they showed the @entity30 people of the city what it feels like to have a public park promoting views that offend your personal conscience			2
these views were on public property that were supposed to be owned equally by everyone			2
" this story is a classic example of the failure to reconcile different interests within a democratic society			1
nobody involved was technically wrong			0
the secularist campaigners were right to say that the nativity displays should be open to everyone because they were on public land			2
their @entity30 opponents were right to insist that anything erected to celebrate @entity0 ought to give some priority to celebrating @entity0			1
and the council was right that , in the absence of consensus , it was better to allow no displays at all			0
the tragedy being that @entity94 's campaign ended up destroying a perfectly wonderful tradition in the name of fairness			2
and that hardly seems fair			0
unfortunately , @entity94 gets around almost as much as @entity135 ; now she 's involved in an effort to take down a @entity34 - shaped war memorial near a popular ski resort in @entity139			1
there 's a thin line between this sort of secularist activism and the politics of personal taste			1
in @entity146 , @entity147 , a jewelry shop manager called the cops on @entity151 bell ringers because the noise was " raising her blood pressure and making her hate @entity0			1
" in @entity155 , the @entity151 was stopped from bell ringing because of a new ban on panhandling			0
what 's really happening is n't just a targeted , political war on @entity0 but a more general battle for control of what goes on in the public sphere , especially around the holidays			1
undoubtedly , some of this is motivated by anti-religious secularism			0
but it 's also the product of living in a crowded multicultural environment where everyone risks getting on each other 's nerves -- and we have to find better ways of getting along			2
one of the reasons why " @entity180 " has risen in use as an alternative seasonal greeting to " @entity0 " is simply that it helps avoid occasions of offense and confrontation			2
religious conservatives complain that it 's a surrender to militant atheism			0
but if that 's the case then the surrender is widespread			0
@entity190 's @entity4 cards wished everyone a happy " holiday season " and even @entity37 has its own @entity192			1
if there is a solution to this controversy then perhaps it 's to try to treat it with a dash of humor and disdain			1
the rev. @entity201 was recently invited on " @entity202 " to unleash hell on the war on @entity0			1
instead , he did the opposite			0
after pointing out that @entity30 have throughout the centuries taken much worse persecution ( and , i might add , dished out a bit , too ) he concluded , " if our @entity0 is going to be all about getting upset at people trying to take away @entity0 , is n't that silly , too ? " @entity213 , @entity212 .			2

@entity215 : it 's not @entity0 without " @entity217 , " a *cooked* up culture crisis
this time , politics in *mix* , with @entity4 , others using holidays to score points , he says
he says " war " really reflects failure to reconcile different interests in democratic society
@entity215 : @entity232 is over what goes on in public sphere . one solution ? have sense of humor
