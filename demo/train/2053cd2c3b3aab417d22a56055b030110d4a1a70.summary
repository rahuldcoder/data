if you 're like @entity1 , you spend a lot of time on your smartphone			2
then again , maybe nobody is quite like @entity1			2
in one recent week , the medical student sent 40 e-mails and 399 text messages , snapped 25 photos , bought two movie tickets , downloaded four songs , watched a full - length film , checked the weather forecast 15 times , shopped at @entity15 , surfed the web for 129 minutes and spent 5Â½ hours socializing with friends on @entity18 -- all from his @entity19			1
" i am not my phone , but my phone is a reflection of me , " said @entity1 , 26 , of @entity20 , @entity21			1
" it does a pretty good job of taking my life and folding it up into a nice little lightweight , pocket - sized summary			1
it 's almost like i am holding a copy of my brain in my hands			2
" as part of our @entity36 series on how phones and tablets are changing our lives , @entity33 asked a handful of people to document everything they do on their smartphones over the course of a week : every text , every tweet , every minute spent scrolling through @entity48 or playing " @entity49			1
" some of the results are displayed here			0
it was an unscientific project			0
our volunteers , self - described smartphone addicts , are probably much more active on their handsets than the average person			0
the idea was simply to demonstrate , whether we realize it or not , how much of our daily lives now is conducted through these little glowing screens			1
it 's not just that we 're on our phones a lot			0
it 's that these devices have become time capsules of our lives , documenting our work , our social interactions , our purchases , our travels , our passions and our guilty pleasures			1
in one week in early september , @entity73 sent 256 e-mails from her phone , many of those as part of her duties as director of housing for a university			1
she also posted 34 updates or comments on @entity18 , " liked " 18 posts and read 93 posts from friends ( 55 of them on her birthday )			0
somehow , she also spent another nine - plus hours that week using her phone to surf the @entity88 , play games , check her bank balances and listen to audiobooks and music			1
" i actually did n't log as many hours as i thought i would , " said @entity73 , 46 , who lives with her husband and their three young children in @entity96			1
" i did n't include any time that i used my phone to entertain my kids			1
... i am very aware of my dependency on my phone , so it was n't too surprising			1
" the phone definitely helps me keep up with all the moving parts of my life			1
i am almost always on the go , and it allows me to juggle everything , " @entity73 added in an e-mail			0
" while some people may feel tied to their jobs because of technology , i am happy to have the advantage of owning a smartphone			1
i ca n't imagine how i would juggle a crazy job , three kids / family obligations , and doctoral studies without it ! i am a happy addict			0
" like @entity73 , most people who shared their smartphone - usage habits said they view their phone as a hugely positive thing in their lives , not a burden or the root of an unhealthy addiction			1
" my friends tell me that i am easily the most accessible person they know			0
my phone is my lifeline , and any attempt to reduce usage is just silly , " said @entity128 , 31 , a freelance writer and social - media consultant			1
@entity128 , who lives in @entity134 , @entity135 , just outside @entity136 , sent 423 texts during the week he tracked his phone use			1
he also sent 228 @entity140 messages , checked in to 26 locations on @entity142 , posted nine photos to @entity48 and placed three orders from @entity145			1
oh , and he received two voice mails			0
he still has n't listened to them			0
like many people who participated in this experiment , @entity148 prefers to communicate via text or e-mail			1
and like the others , he finds it difficult to go more than a few minutes without checking his @entity155			0
he sees his phone almost as an extension of himself			2
" if somebody picks up my phone , it does make me nervous , " he said			2
" it 's not a privacy issue			0
there 's nothing that i 'm hiding			0
i just think it 's a very personal item			0
" @entity1 , the @entity20 med - school student , said he did n't realize just how much he used his @entity19 until he documented his usage for a week			2
" i was stunned by just how integrated my phone has become in my life			1
it is almost an anatomical appendage , attached to my person as though it were a part of my hand , " he said			0
on the few occasions @entity1 has left home without taking his phone , he 's become anxious and depressed			2
" my palms get sweaty , my heart races , i start biting my lip , " he said in an e-mail			0
" my mind is occupied by thoughts of going home to get the phone			2
i feel cut off from the world			0
" after jotting down all his phone usage and staring at the page -- almost 800 text messages sent and received -- @entity1 wondered whether he was relying on his phone too much			1
should he cut back ? was he missing out on the world around him ? were his relationships suffering ? ultimately , he decided no. @entity1 also uses his phone to study and do medical research , and he believes the benefits of using it outweigh any potential downside			2
" we do need to be careful not to digitalize our entire existence , not to replace our lives with a microchip , " he said			2
but @entity1 believes that his phone enhances , and not detracts from , his real - life human interactions			1
to him it breaks down barriers and gives him freedom			0
" i feel like my desktop / laptop anchor me into one place			0
they are ancient in a sense , the electronic devices of our parents and grandparents , " he said			0
" i do not want to be trapped by the confines of a desk and chair , and today 's world is not as compatible with that type of device			0
today 's world is too fluid for that			0
