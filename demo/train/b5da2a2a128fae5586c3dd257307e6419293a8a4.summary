-- it was a fable made famous by football -- now @entity4 's rising tennis star @entity3 is doing his best to dismiss the long - held sporting notion that size does matter			1
of the sports ' top 15 players , only two are shorter than 6 ' 0 " -- @entity3 , who stands at 5 ' 10 and @entity13 's current world no. 5 @entity11 who is an inch shorter than the @entity4 player			1
the world 's top four players - @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - are all over 6 ' 0 , while six of the top 15 are 6 ' 5 " or taller			1
height is particularly important in tennis as it makes a player 's service harder to return because of the power , height and bounce that can be generated by the server			1
so the tallest player of all time @entity34 , who is 6 " 10 ' , is capable of serving at 251km/hr			0
the 22 - year - old @entity3 relies on a vast array of ground strokes and blistering speed to counteract the power he often faces in opponents that sometimes tower nearly a foot over him			1
and he is slowly proving this supposed disadvantage can be his primary weapon , as his finest year to date unfolds			2
in 2012 he became the first @entity4 man to reach the quarterfinals of the @entity44 in 80 years and the first @entity4 player to win his home nation 's most prestigious tournament in its 40 - year history			1
his 7 - 6 3 - 6 6 - 0 win over the 6 ' 4 " @entity53 earlier in october was also the first time @entity3 had won a trophy since @entity51 in 2008			1
with the help of veteran @entity56 -- the coach @entity3 calls the greatest in the history of the game -- and @entity60 , the @entity4 star currently sits proudly as the 15th best player in the world			1
" i am not the tallest guy on tour so i have to have good legs and good speed and that 's my weapon , " @entity4 's rising son told @entity0 's @entity64 , as he reflected on the task of taking on the giant , fast - serving titans of the modern game			1
. " it 's not easy to play with big servers because , for me , it 's hard to hold my serve			2
it is getting better but still , not easy			0
not as easy as tall guys			0
" i think i have a good return			0
i have good speed ; i have to cover with my legs			2
i can do different things than those tall guys			0
its not easy but i have to mix the shots			0
" technique wins out the " size matters " myth has been ground to dust in other sports in recent years			2
it was a theory that held steadfast in soccer until countries like world champions @entity13 , and @entity95 , moved away from height and physical strength as a cornerstone of their philosophy , turning to a new generation of more diminutive , technically gifted players			2
the most dominant @entity104 club side of recent years has been @entity13 giants @entity103 , whose players make up the nucleus of an all - conquering @entity13 team			1
among their ranks is @entity112 striker @entity111 , considered by many to be one of the finest footballers in history , who stands just 5 ' 6 " tall			0
as for @entity56 , who has honed the talents of players like @entity119 and @entity120 at his famous @entity122 academy , he is in no doubt @entity3 's nimbleness around the court is his main weapon in his battle against more lofty opponents			1
" @entity3 is a shot maker , " @entity56 told @entity0			1
" and when he 's on , he can beat anybody in the world			2
now remember , @entity3 is not a big guy			2
so he has to be very careful to take advantage of the opportunities when he gets them			0
" if you 're small , it 's more difficult , no matter what anybody says			2
if you look at today , probably the height of the guys is 6 ' 2 " , 6 ' 3 " , the ladies up at 5 ' 9 " , 5 ' 10 " , @entity143 6 ' 3 " , @entity144 6 ' 2 "			2
" so you take that as fact and you do n't throw in the white towel and say ' i ca n't do it '			0
what @entity3 has , he has mobility , he creates and he has unbelievable hands and feet that you ca n't purchase			2
" so he has to keep adding , keep working on any defensive balls , come to the net a little bit more , and this is what @entity60 is working on			0
if he stays status quo , he 'll win a lot of matches			0
" but to be among the big boys and to break that top 10 , which we all feel he will do , he probably will have to add a little bit more transition to his game			0
" role model @entity3 's dramatic progress this season has mirrored that of @entity174 driver @entity173 ; both men hoping to act as a catalyst for burgeoning interest in their respective sports			1
" basically , in @entity4 , they 're not giants , " added @entity56			1
" you look at some of the good players , they 're very strong , good ground strokes , " he said			0
" it gives hope , and you get more people out there playing the game			0
the more people that play the game increases your chances of having good players , great players , and hopefully some day a champion			0
" @entity3 's recent victory in the @entity198 , when he became the first @entity4 player to claim the title since the competition began in 1972 , has only strengthened the belief within his camp that a grand slam title is within reach			1
the 22 - year - old 's epic victory over @entity209 's @entity208 at the @entity44 in january saw him become the first player from @entity4 to make the last eight in @entity212 since 1932			1
and with time on his side , the hope is that @entity3 could finally end @entity4 's long wait for a major champion			1
" of course i want to win grand slams , " he said			0
" i think everyone is the same			0
but my favourite tournaments are the @entity220 and the @entity221 -- those two i like			0
so hopefully i can win one of the grand slams			0
" ' @entity224 ' @entity3 's first @entity226 title at @entity51 came at the tender age of 18 when he was still outside the top 240 players in the world			1
it was @entity4 's first tournament success since @entity232 won the @entity233 in 1992			1
it also served as justification for his family 's decision to send him to @entity56 's academy as a 13 - year - old , even though he spoke not a word of @entity241			1
" the first year was tough , because without @entity241 i was really shy so i could n't speak much with friends , " explained @entity3			1
" but i was enjoying playing tennis all day			0
i would start playing tennis from 7am until 5pm , so that was fun for me			0
" his @entity51 triumph gave rise to what became known as ' @entity224 ' in @entity4			2
positively orwellian in title , it was actually @entity3 's mission to overhaul @entity232 's career best ranking of 46 -- the highest any @entity4 player has ever reached			1
@entity3 broke through that particular barrier at last year 's @entity257 and now has his sights set on the top 10			1
should he do that , @entity3 might have to increase his wardrobe of disguises , to avoid being mobbed on home soil			1
" in @entity4 it is a bit crazy			2
i have to hide -- i have to wear caps , sunglasses , masks			0
i look weird but sometimes i have to do that			0
like when i go shopping everybody starts tailing to me and i ca n't concentrate to shop ! "			0

@entity4 's @entity3 has reached a career high ranking of 15 in the men 's game
the 22 - year - old recently won the @entity198 and became first home winner in 40 - years
@entity3 is another *product* of coach @entity56 's famous @entity122 academy
he makes up for lack of height with on - court speed and a vast array of winners
