-- the going idea is that texting has , in essence , made graffiti a universal pastime : barely punctuated , sparsely capitalized and with decidedly creative spellings throughout , texting means that today 's @entity8 is reveling in writing badly			1
ten years ago ( we 'll soon get to why it would only be back then ) the proper answer to this would have been lol -- " laughing out loud " -- because in reality , texting is sprouting new grammar all the time			1
yes , grammar , as subtle and sophisticated as subjunctives and such			0
today , it would n't signify amusement the way it did when it first caught on			2
@entity22 texts " where have you been ? " and @entity23 texts back " lol at the library studying for two hours			2
" how funny is that , really ? or an exchange such as " lol theres only one slice left " / " do n't deprive me lol " -- text exchanges often drip with these @entity33 's the way normal writing drips with commas			1
let 's face it -- no mentally composed human being spend his or her entire life immersed in ceaseless hilarity			2
the @entity33 must mean something else			0
they signal basic empathy between texters			2
what began as signifying laughter morphed into easing tension and creating a sense of equality			0
watch @entity54 's @entity53 that is , " lol " no longer " means " anything			1
rather , it " does something " -- conveying an attitude -- just as the ending " - ed " does n't " mean " anything but conveys past tense			2
@entity33 is , of all things , grammar			0
of course , no texter thinks about that consciously			0
but then most of communication operates below the radar , where things tend not to mean what they would literally			2
over time , the meaning of a word or an expression drifts			0
" meat " used to mean any kind of food			0
" @entity75 " used to mean , believe it or not , blessed			0
we can see lol - type expressions happening in speech			0
" i know , right ? " means little ; it assures the listener of agreement and acknowledgment			0
or , there is the phrase " you know what i 'm sayin ' ? " used most in what is best known as " @entity88 , " but increasingly by young people of various shades and demographics			1
@entity53 : q&a with @entity54 technically , it is composed of seven words : do , you , know , what , i , am , and saying			1
however , it is now more often pronounced as two syllables -- " noam sayin ' ? " -- or sometimes even just a single one , roughly : " @entity102 ? " it , too , is now a piece of grammar , soliciting the same sense of empathy and group membership that @entity33 does			0
@entity33 is one of several texting expressions that convey nuance in a system where you do n't have the voice and face to do it the way you normally would			1
civilization , then , is fine			0
people banging away on their smartphones are fluently using a code separate from the one they use in actual writing , but a code it is , to which linguists are currently devoting articles			1
people have been warning us that language was going to the dogs ever since @entity131 started turning into @entity132			1
yet the dogs in question never seem to emerge yelping on the horizon			0
@entity53 : @entity136 on what our language habits reveal there is no evidence that texting is ruining composition skills			1
worldwide , people speak differently than they write , and texting -- quick , casual and only intended to be read once -- is actually a way of talking with your fingers			1
all indications are that @entity8 's youth are doing it quite well			0
texting is not the mangling of language -- it 's the birth of a new one			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity54 .			1

@entity54 : people see the language of texting as a sign of bad writing
he says the *evolution* of the phrase " lol " shows how texting is a new form of communication
once a sign of humor , now " lol " is a way of indicating empathy , he says
@entity54 : texting is n't *corrupting* the way we communicate ; it 's *enhancing* it
