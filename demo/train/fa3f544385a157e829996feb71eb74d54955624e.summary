-- the past year has seen the number of @entity3 drone strikes in @entity5 plummet			2
in the first three months of 2012 , there were 11 , compared with 21 in the first three months of 2011 and a record 28 in the first quarter of 2010			0
on monday , @entity5 's parliament started to debate whether the @entity10 should be made to stop @entity3 drone strikes altogether in the @entity5 border regions with @entity12 and also whether the @entity10 should apologize for @entity14 airstrikes that killed some two dozen @entity5 soldiers late last year			1
given the high level of hostility to the @entity10 in @entity5 , the results of the parliamentary debate are pretty much a foregone conclusion			1
the parliament will almost certainly vote against the allowing the continuation of the drone strikes and will also demand an @entity10 apology for the deaths of its soldiers			2
@entity28 calls for balanced approach on @entity10 - @entity5 relations the debate in parliament comes as relations between the @entity10 and @entity5 have reached a nadir , caused by a wave of incidents over the past year that have poisoned the two countries ' already often troubled relationship : -- the killing of two @entity5 by a @entity3 contractor in january 2011			1
-- the unilateral @entity10 attack on @entity43 's compound in @entity44 four months later			1
-- the airstrikes by @entity14 in november that killed the @entity5 soldiers			2
that incident caused @entity5 to close its borders to trucks resupplying @entity14 soldiers in @entity12			0
at 2 a.m. november 26 , two @entity5 border posts about half a kilometer from the @entity12 border came under heavy fire from @entity14 helicopters that had strayed across the border into @entity5 airspace			0
@entity5 officials immediately termed the attack , which killed 26 @entity5 soldiers , a " deliberate act of aggression , " while @entity10 officials maintained that the @entity5 security officials had fired on the helicopters first			1
either way , the friendly fire incident was devastating , not least to the @entity10 drone program in @entity5 's tribal regions , which was subsequently suspended for almost seven weeks , one of the longest pauses in the strikes since the program started in 2004			1
@entity5 also ordered the @entity10 to vacate @entity72 in @entity73 , from which many of the @entity3 drones were launched			1
for many months before this incident , the @entity10 ' aggressive drone campaign in @entity5 had been slowing			1
there were 70 drone strikes in @entity5 's tribal regions in 2011 , down from 118 in 2010 , which saw the peak number of strikes since the program began			2
the drop in drone strikes during 2011 was because a series of events that wore on the ever - fragile @entity10 - @entity5 relationship			1
on january 27 , 2011 , an @entity10 citizen , @entity89 , shot and killed two @entity5 who he said were attempting to rob him in the streets of @entity91			1
despite @entity10 claims of diplomatic immunity because of @entity89 ' employment at the @entity10 consulate in @entity91 , he landed in jail , charged with a double murder and illegal weapons possession			0
much of the @entity5 public was outraged when it was revealed in february that @entity89 was a @entity3 contractor			0
as a result of the complex negotiations to get @entity89 out of @entity5 jail , there were just three @entity3 drone strikes in february and another nine strikes in march while @entity10 officials worked to settle the issue and finally bring @entity89 home			1
the day after @entity89 was finally released , a strike on march 17 , 2011 , killed a reported 36 civilians , as well as a top @entity113 commander			0
@entity5 officials condemned the strike , and @entity5 took to the streets to protest them			0
the @entity3 suspended drone strikes for a month , before resuming them again on april 13			0
less than a month after the drone strikes had picked up , on may 1 , @entity118 secretly flew into @entity5 territory aboard stealth helicopters to capture or kill @entity43 , who was living not far from the @entity5 capital , @entity123			1
@entity5 's powerful military establishment was angry about the violation of its sovereignty , and relations between the @entity10 and @entity5 sank further			1
for their part , many @entity10 were outraged that @entity130 's leader had been living for years in a sizable city in central @entity5			1
aware of how unpopular the drone strikes were becoming in @entity5 , some top @entity133 and @entity134 officials behind the scenes were pushing for more selective drone strikes , which the @entity3 opposed			2
the @entity138 ordered an evaluation of the drone program during the summer of 2011			0
the study found that the @entity3 was primarily killing low - level militants in its drone strikes			2
those results prompted the government to implement new rules in november governing when and how specific drone strikes were authorized			0
the @entity134 was given a larger say in the decision - making process			0
@entity5 leaders were promised advanced notification of some strikes			0
the @entity3 pledged to refrain from conducting strikes during visits by @entity5 officials to the @entity10			2
but the new rules are unlikely to placate critics inside and outside of @entity5 , who condemn the violation of @entity5 's sovereignty and the killing of its civilians			0
at the @entity164 , we maintain an up - to - date database of every reported drone strike in @entity5 's tribal regions since 2004			2
we monitor reports about the strikes from the top @entity171 and @entity5 news sources , such as the @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity0 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and others			0
according to our data , 7 % of the fatalities resulting from drone strikes in 2011 were civilians , up 2 percentage points from our figure in 2010			0
over the life of the @entity3 drone program in @entity5 from 2004 to 2012 , we found that the civilian casualty rate has been 17 %			0
clearly , as the years have progressed , the drone strikes have become more precise and discriminating			0
there is still considerable debate over how the @entity10 government defines a " militant " and how easily it is able to distinguish between militants and civilians from a drone cruising tens of thousands of feet above the ground			0
in march 2011 , maj. gen. @entity198 acknowledged that " the number of innocent people being killed is relatively low " and that " most of the targets are hard - core militants , " the first such public acknowledgment by a senior @entity5 military officer			2
similarly , president @entity28 made his first public comments about the covert drone program , when he told participants of a google+ " hangout " on january 30 this year that the @entity10 only conducts " very precise precision strikes against @entity130 and their affiliates , and we 're very careful in terms of how it 's been applied			1
" even if it is the case that there are relatively few civilians killed in the strikes , the drone program is quite unpopular in @entity5			2
the @entity164 conducted one of the few public opinion polls in @entity5 's @entity219 during the summer of 2010 and found that almost 90 % of the respondents in the region where the drone strikes are located oppose @entity10 military operations in the region			1
the wider @entity5 public shares this sentiment , though to a lesser degree			0
a poll conducted by the @entity229 in june 2011 found that about six of every 10 @entity5 consider the drone campaign to be unnecessary			0
despite the fact that the pace of drone strikes slowed considerably from 2010 to 2011 , the number of strikes last year still ranked as the second - highest annual count since the drone program began			0
and despite its deteriorating relations with @entity5 , the @entity10 killed a number of key @entity130 leaders with drone strikes in 2011			1
@entity130 's top operative in @entity5 and purported conduit between the terrorist group and the @entity5 @entity113 , @entity245 , was reported killed in a strike on june 4			1
then , on august 22 , a drone reportedly killed @entity130 's top operational planner , @entity248 , dealing another heavy blow to the organization			1
and in september , a drone strike killed @entity252 , the man believed to be responsible for planning @entity130 's operations in the region			2
the continued success of strikes against @entity130 's top leaders led defense secretary @entity259 to declare in july that the @entity10 was " within reach of strategically defeating @entity130			1
" according to senior @entity10 counterterrorism officials , @entity130 's leadership bench has been so thinned by the drone campaign that there are only two real leaders of the organization left : @entity43 's successor as overall leader of the group , @entity268 , and @entity270			1
this raises an interesting question : maybe one of the reasons that the drone campaign has eased off in the past several months is that the @entity3 has begun to run out of real targets ?			0
