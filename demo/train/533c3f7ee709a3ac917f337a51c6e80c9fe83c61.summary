-- update : @entity2 landed safely on @entity3 after jumping from 128,000 feet			1
i will always wonder what it was like to huddle around a shortwave radio and through the crackling static from space hear the faint beeps of the world 's first satellite -- @entity13			1
i also missed watching @entity15 step foot on the moon and the first space shuttle take off for the stars			1
those events were way before my time			1
as a kid , i was fascinated with what goes on in the sky , and when @entity23 pulled the plug on the shuttle program i was heartbroken			1
yet the privatized space race has renewed my childhood dreams to reach for the stars			1
as a meteorologist , i 've still seen many important weather and space events , but right now , if you were sitting next to me , you 'd hear my foot tapping rapidly under my desk			1
i 'm anxious for the next one : a space capsule hanging from a crane in the @entity38 desert			2
it 's like the set for a @entity42 movie floating to the edge of space			2
you and i will have the chance to watch a man take a leap into an unimaginable free fall from the edge of space -- live			2
tuesday , i sat at work glued to the live stream of the @entity53 @entity52			2
i watched the balloons positioned at different altitudes in the sky to test the winds , knowing that if they would just line up in a vertical straight line " we " would be go for launch			2
i feel this mission was created for me because i am also a journalist and a photographer , but above all i live for taking a leap of faith -- the feeling of pushing the envelope into uncharted territory			2
the guy who is going to do this , @entity2 , must have that same feeling , at a level i will never reach			1
however , it did not stop me from feeling his pain when a gust of swirling wind kicked up and twisted the partially filled balloon that would take him to the upper end of our atmosphere			2
as soon as the 40 - acre balloon , with skin no thicker than a dry cleaning bag , scraped the ground i knew it was over			2
how claustrophobia almost grounded supersonic skydiver with each twist , you could see the wrinkles of disappointment on the face of the current record holder and " capcom " ( capsule communications ) , col. @entity95			2
he hung his head low in mission control as he told @entity2 the disappointing news : mission aborted			1
the supersonic descent could happen as early as sunday afternoon			0
for the latest updates on timing , check @entity53 's status clock the weather plays an important role in this mission			1
starting at the ground , conditions have to be very calm -- winds less than 2 mph , with no precipitation or humidity and limited cloud cover			0
the balloon , with capsule attached , will move through the lower level of the atmosphere ( the troposphere ) where our day - to - day weather lives			1
it will climb higher than the tip of @entity122 ( 5.5 miles / 8.85 kilometers ) , drifting even higher than the cruising altitude of commercial airliners ( 5.6 miles / 9.17 kilometers ) and into the stratosphere			1
as he crosses the boundary layer ( called the tropopause ) , he can expect a lot of turbulence			0
the balloon will slowly drift to the edge of space at 120,000 feet ( 22.7 miles / 36.53 kilometers )			1
here , " @entity2 " will unclip			1
he will roll back the door			0
then , i would assume , he will slowly step out onto something resembling an @entity138 diving platform			0
below , the @entity3 becomes the concrete bottom of a swimming pool that he wants to land on , but not too hard			0
still , he 'll be traveling fast , so despite the distance , it will not be like diving into the deep end of a pool			0
it will be like he is diving into the shallow end			0
skydiver preps for the big jump when he jumps , he is expected to reach the speed of sound -- 690 mph ( 1,110 kph ) -- in less than 40 seconds			1
like hitting the top of the water , he will begin to slow as he approaches the more dense air closer to @entity3			0
but this will not be enough to stop him completely			0
if he goes too fast or spins out of control , he has a stabilization parachute that can be deployed to slow him down			0
his team hopes it 's not needed			0
instead , he plans to deploy his 270 - square - foot ( 25 - square - meter ) main chute at an altitude of around 5,000 feet ( 1,524 meters )			0
in order to deploy this chute successfully , he will have to slow to 172 mph ( 277 kph )			0
he will have a reserve parachute that will open automatically if he loses consciousness at mach speeds			0
even if everything goes as planned , it wo n't			0
@entity2 still will free fall at a speed that would cause you and me to pass out , and no parachute is guaranteed to work higher than 25,000 feet ( 7,620 meters )			1
it might not be the moon , but @entity95 free fell from 102,800 feet in 1960 -- at the dawn of an infamous space race that captured the hearts of many			0
@entity2 will attempt to break that record , a feat that boggles the mind			1
this is one of those monumental moments i will always remember , because there is no way i 'd miss this .			0

@entity2 to attempt skydive from 23 miles up
weather will determine whether the jump will go on
meteorologist @entity194 is anxiously awaiting the jump
