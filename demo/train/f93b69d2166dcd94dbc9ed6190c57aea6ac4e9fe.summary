-- until a few months ago , @entity2 's @entity1 was the world 's largest nature reserve at 972,000 square kilometers -- bigger than all but 30 countries on @entity8			1
there are now two spots that eclipse it			2
for a few short weeks , the @entity13 semi-autonomous territory of @entity14 in the southwest @entity15 held the top spot , having established the world 's largest marine managed area in may			1
covering 1.3 million square kilometers ( 502,000 square miles ) -- the territory 's entire economic zone -- the @entity22 of the @entity23 protects the world 's second longest double barrier reef and the world 's largest marine lagoon , an underwater coliseum where the level of endemism ( the number of species found nowhere else on earth ) is off the charts			1
" because it lies in a temperate zone , the marine biodiversity of @entity14 's reef is very peculiar , " says @entity35 , director of the @entity36 in the capital @entity38			1
" so we have an obligation to humanity to keep the reef pristine			2
" on june 17 , the @entity46 outdid @entity14 when it declared an even bigger national park in the central @entity15 measuring 2 million square kilometers			1
but getting there is difficult			2
the @entity46 - controlled islands lying between @entity50 and @entity51 that are incorporated into the new @entity52 are mostly uninhabited or off limits to all but a handful of scientists			1
@entity14 's park , however , is open for business			1
here are three novel ways to experience the world 's largest " accessible " national park			1
on a surf board on the east coast of the main island of @entity64 , @entity65 beach is a long strip of sand edged by an extraordinary cliff formation that looks like a giant chess piece			2
it 's the only known place in @entity14 where one can surf off the shore			1
the waves are for beginners but the real action lies three kilometers out to sea , where the swell hits the outer reef to produce thick and hollow waves			1
@entity79 runs @entity80 ( @entity81 for the @entity15 ) , a small surfing and fishing camp set in the mangrove forest behind @entity85			2
a typical day starts with breakfast at 6:30 a.m. followed by a half - hour motorboat ride to the outer reef			2
there , guests spend the next five hours surfing two different reef breaks , snorkeling or fishing for snapper to be baked back at the camp			1
" we saw four - to five - foot ( 1.2 - 1.5 meter ) waves , but it can get up to six to eight feet , " says @entity96 , a surfer and recent visitor from @entity98			2
" but the best things about it is nobody was there			0
" @entity106 ( +687 784 026 ) offers seven - day surf camps and bungalow - style accommodation with communal meals from $ 1,386			0
book via @entity112 or @entity113			0
on a yacht each june , a dozen or so monohulls and catamarans sail out of @entity38 's @entity117 to compete for glory at the @entity119			1
the friendly three - day , 90 - nautical - mile yacht race heads along the west coast of @entity64 to @entity122 for a night , then through the @entity123 and south to @entity124 for a second night at sea before heading back to @entity38			0
this is n't an event filled with wind - burnt sailors who wake at the crack of dawn to swab the decks and raise the sails			0
the crews -- families and groups of friends from @entity38 plus a few ring - ins from @entity138 and @entity139 -- spend race nights at sea eating paella , drinking punch and dancing to ' 80s hits on the beach			0
they are n't early risers			0
for those who are , the late - morning starts present an opportunity to borrow a kayak or tender to explore the outer reef and its rich marine life			1
or to walk around a tropical island all by themselves			0
" in this small part of the lagoon you have at last 50 little islands , " says @entity155 , a super-yacht agent in @entity38 who co-founded the regatta in 2011			0
" even on the weekend you can find a place to be alone			0
" the @entity162 ( +687 795 601 ) is held on the first weekend of june			0
entry is free for foreign boats			0
@entity165 ( +687 799 118 ) in @entity38 rent 43 - foot catamarans that sleep eight to 10 people for $ 900 a day			0
add $ 275 per day for a skipper			0
through a snorkel mask less than 20 kilometers from @entity38 , @entity170 is a campground straight out of " the @entity171			1
" on weekends , rangers visit to leave chopped wood for people to enjoy campfires on the beach			0
camping is free but most visitors sleep on yachts and motorboats moored around the island on floating buoys designed to protect the reef from anchor drag			0
more alien than the edge of space and more spectacular than an exploding supernova , the coral here is free of the bleaching and crown - of - thorns starfish infestation affecting reefs throughout other parts of the @entity15			0
the rich coral creates habitat for an extraordinary number of marine species : leopard sharks , green turtles , dugongs , shoals of rare bump - headed parrot fish and yellow sea perch , poisonous but friendly banded sea snakes , clown fish , big sweetlip cod , huge toothy groupers , delicate feather starfish and the serene butterfly - shaped fish from " @entity212 " known as moorish idol			1
" it 's incredible to have this quality of water and coral so close to the city , " says @entity214 , a diver who runs small group snorkeling tours to @entity170			1
@entity222 ( +687 779 072 ; bernard.andreani.nc@gmail.com ) offers half - day snorkeling , walking and birdwatching boat tours to @entity170 for $ 170 for two people			1
tours depart 8 a.m. from @entity38 's @entity228			2
getting there : @entity230 and @entity231 offer codeshare flights to @entity14 from @entity233 and @entity234			1
flight times from @entity236 and @entity138 are less than three hours			0
@entity237 is a 45 - minute drive from the capital , @entity38			2
@entity240 is a @entity138 - based freelance journalist specializing in adventure travel			0
he 's the author of two travel novels , @entity243 ( 2004 ) and @entity244 ( 2006 ) .			2
