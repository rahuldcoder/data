-- a series of cities are in the grip of soaring temperatures this weekend			0
from @entity5 , to @entity6 , to @entity7 in @entity8 , which set a world - record high a century ago			1
@entity7 was the hottest spot saturday , reaching 127 degrees , and @entity11 and @entity12 continued in a record - setting heat wave that is forecast to last through tuesday			1
the heat may have led to the death of a man in his 80s in @entity6 , where the temperature saturday hit 115 degrees , tying a record set in 1994 , the @entity14 said			1
paramedics found the man dead in his home , which did not have air conditioning , said @entity27 spokesman @entity26			1
he died of cardiac arrest and the heat may have contributed to his death , although the coroner will make the final determination , he said			1
the heatwave comes just a couple weeks before the 100th anniversary of what the @entity14 calls the " highest reliably recorded air temperature on @entity36 " -- 134 degrees on july 10 , 1913 , in @entity7 's @entity37			1
at @entity38 , the heat will stay on full blast through tuesday , at least			2
at night , the mercury will drop to a relatively cool 96 degrees			0
" we have more work than we can handle , " said @entity41 of @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity8			1

" the only time the technicians can have some cold air , @entity41 told @entity0 , is when they 're driving			2
fun aside , the heat wave scorching the @entity52 is dangerous , as 170 concertgoers found out friday evening in @entity6 , according to the fire department			1
ambulances plucked them out of 110 - degree heat in an open - air music venue and drove them to a shady spot , where they could sit down and drink water			1
another 30 people were treated for heat ailments in local hospitals			2
@entity66 hurts your insides too " i 'm not worried as much about the people who have lived here a while , " said sgt. @entity69 , police spokesman in the @entity71 , @entity11 , near the @entity8 state line			1
" it 's more the tourists coming into the area , even from @entity8 , who are n't used to this kind of heat			1
" a man driving from northern @entity12 to southern @entity11 stopped at a @entity6 highway exit saturday after his car 's air conditioning unit broke and he drove for several hours without it , @entity26 said			1
he stopped at the exit to call 911 , and when paramedics arrived , they found the man suffering from heat stroke			1
civic and emergency officials throughout the @entity52 say that if there was ever a time to worry , this would be it			0

" it 'll still be hot , but not as intense as we 're seeing now , " said @entity111 , a meteorologist with the @entity14 in @entity6			1
forecasters say temperatures through the weekend could rival a 2005 heat wave that killed 17 people in the @entity6 area			1
the culprit is a high pressure dome that 's blocking cooler air coming down from the @entity122 , @entity0 meteorologist @entity123 said			2
that system wo n't begin to break up until early next week , she said			0
as a result , @entity5 residents saw a high of 119 degrees on saturday -- setting a new record for the day			0

for those who have to do any strenuous activity outside , he advises doing it in the early morning , evening or simply putting it off until the end of the week when the temperatures are lower			0
such high temperatures can put people at risk for heat exhaustion or heat stroke , which can be fatal			0
