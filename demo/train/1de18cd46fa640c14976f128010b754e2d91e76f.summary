@entity0 -- @entity1 's @entity2 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday on " @entity5 " to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			0
talk of @entity14 's role in the campaign stretch , where his wife hopes to make a difference , a 2016 @entity9 buildup and some 2014 observations from the trail made for a lively trip around the " @entity5 " table on sunday			1
@entity9 grass roots sees a growing immigration crisis we thought after the 2012 presidential election that @entity9 would see their crisis with @entity26 voters and find some way to strike an immigration reform compromise with president @entity29			0
it did n't happen , largely because of pressure from grass - roots conservatives who oppose any path to citizenship for the undocumented and consider even granting legal status tantamount to amnesty			0
well , if you believed perhaps there would be room , and motivation , for a deal after the 2014 midterms -- think again			0
one striking common theme from a 1,200 - mile drive this past week across @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 is the visceral reaction of conservatives when immigration comes up -- and often they are the ones to raise it early in any chat about what is driving their politics			2
perhaps it 's not surprising to hear this anger at a @entity46 tea party meeting , where one speaker warned that @entity65 suicide bombers are deliberately infecting themselves with @entity66 and coming across the @entity69 - @entity68 border planning to " cough and spit " on @entity69 " before blowing themselves up			1
" but talk of a wide - open border being exploited by terrorists also animated four @entity47 women during a chat at a senior center in @entity79 's hometown of @entity80 , and came up in conversations with voters in conservative rural @entity49			2
the bottom line : there appears to be little political space for @entity87 speaker @entity86 and @entity89 @entity9 leader @entity88 , who could well be majority leader in january , to negotiate any deal that would be acceptable to @entity29			0
and , when the president takes executive actions , as he promises to do after the election unless there is some legislative breakthrough , it is clear the conservative grass roots will demand confrontation -- leaving the issue front and center as we head into the 2016 presidential cycle			0
@entity106 's delicate @entity105 balancing act @entity106 is closing the 2014 campaign with appearances designed to both help @entity111 candidates this cycle and also help her test themes for her likely @entity87 run in 2016			1
last week it was @entity116			0
this week it 's @entity118 and @entity119 , to help two @entity111 women in close gubernatorial contests			1
the @entity119 stop , in particular , has an interesting twist , as detailed by @entity125 's @entity124 : " that 's the one to watch , because @entity127 has been criticized as being too close to @entity105 herself			1
this has been a commentary applied to @entity106 , " said @entity124			2
" watch and see what @entity106 's words are as she is helping her up there			1
@entity14 to court @entity136 - @entity69 voters in @entity137 and while @entity106 is in @entity138 , " @entity14 " @entity14 will be in the @entity139 trying to help @entity111 rescue a @entity89 seat that appears to be slipping away			1
@entity141 of the @entity142 added the nickname for the former president and she noted his hope of generating increased turnout among african - americans			0
" where he can really help her is with black voters in @entity137 , " said @entity141			1
" she 's going to get virtually all of them , both sides would say , but it 's a matter of getting them to the polls , and @entity14 might be able to work his magic down there to help her do that			2
" turning out the @entity136 - @entity69 vote is a top priority for @entity111 there and in several other states now , and there could be a sequel if the @entity137 race ends up in a runoff			1
up all night on november 4 ? maybe a good time to invest in coffee futures ? or book an advance airfare to @entity139 or -- @entity170 ? @entity171 of the @entity172 rightly points out the likelihood of a late election night because so many @entity89 races are so close , including an @entity177 contest that , in addition to the time zone issue , also includes many remote areas where the count could spill into wednesday			0
even then , he points out the possibility that control of the @entity89 might not be clear until months after november 4			0
" i talked to a lot of folks from both parties over the weekend -- increasingly certain that @entity187 is in fact going to a runoff , " said @entity171			0
" and by the way , that 's a january runoff			0
@entity192 , the " tea - vangelical " vote , @entity66 and 2016 speaking of 2016 , keep an eye on dr. @entity192			1
the conservative favorite is adding staff to his talk of a possible presidential run , @entity195 of the @entity196 reports			0
and supporters looking to encourage a @entity192 run are raising some serious money			2
" he 's got a virtual campaign - in - waiting , a campaign chairman , his super pac raised $ 3 million in this last third quarter -- ready for @entity106 was only able to raise $ 2 million , " said @entity209			1
" look for him to challenge @entity211 and @entity212 for that key ' tea - vangelical ' vote			1
and this @entity66 scare certainly gives him something of an opening to flex his medical knowledge during these next couple of days			2
