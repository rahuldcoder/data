@entity0 , @entity1 -- the earthquake of 2010 is not the first one of this magnitude in @entity7 's long , traumatic history			1
almost 50 years ago , i was watching a soccer match in the @entity11 in @entity7 's capital when , seconds after a gigantic rumble from under the ground terrified the 60,000 fans attending the game , the mountains suddenly disappeared			1
i am not exaggerating : the stadium was rocked like a cradle and rose in the air , blotting out my view of the @entity21 , and then , fortunately for all of us , settled back to stability			0
we had just been through what is still considered , at 9.6 on the @entity25 , the greatest seismic activity ever recorded			2
we soon learned that the epicenter had been more than 400 miles south of @entity28 and that the devastation was massive			0
on top of the quake itself , which had flattened towns and killed thousands , a tsunami had swept our coast , causing even more havoc			2
a few months later , when i traveled to that region , i saw for myself the masts of large sunken ships in the @entity41 many miles inland , and the remains of colossal iron - smelting ovens in @entity44 that had been twisted beyond recognition by the rush of the invading waters			0
the human toll was unbearable			0
from the survivors , i heard of men , women , children heading for the hills and being sucked out to sea as if they were driftwood			0
i remember all this now so many decades later as i watch , this time from afar , this time from the safety of my home in the @entity60 , yet another ruinous earthquake destroy my country			2
i remember @entity63 to offer myself some sort of historical perspective on the recent earthquake , offer myself some trembling ground , so to speak , beneath my feet , as i try to come to terms with the possible meaning of what has just happened			2
it is obscene to compare cataclysms as if they were contestants in a horror show -- this one cost so many billions , that one cost so many lives -- and yet , to measure what has changed in @entity7 between these two major disasters in the intervening half century may help us to answer what is , after all , the most urgent question of the moment : what lies ahead ? @entity7 is today a far more prosperous country than it was 50 years ago			1
its economy is considered the most dynamic and advanced in all of @entity86 -- even though still ravaged now by a grossly unfair distribution of income			0
this relative affluence of @entity7 ( the gdp today is 15 times more than in 1960 ! ) leaves us better equipped to deal with our current catastrophe , as we have human and scientific resources that we could scarcely have dreamt of back then , to the point that our wonderful outgoing president , @entity97 , initially informed the international community that the country would not require foreign assistance ( she has since modified that stance and aid from abroad is starting to arrive )			1
paradoxically , however , @entity7 's advances in technology , its abundance of material goods , its many highways and bypasses , its enormous fleet of planes and cars and high - rises , leaves much more of the land and many more of its citizens open to distress , and makes the economy more vulnerable			1
the richer you are , the harder your potential fall			0
the more roads you have , the more cracks in the pavement			0
this wealth , furthermore , has not been accumulated without severe social consequences			0
back in 1960 , the whole nation came together to rebuild the country			1
i spent the month after the earthquake , like many university students , collecting money , food , blankets and mattresses that were sent down to the south in caravans filled with enthusiastic volunteers			0
it was a lesson in solidarity that i have never forgotten -- those who were most deprived gave so much , cared so much , sacrificed so much for their wounded compatriots			0
if @entity7 is more opulent now , it has also become a more egocentric and individualistic society where , instead of a vision of social justice for all , the citizenry is , for the most part , engaged in a frenzied race toward ever more consumption and subject , of course , to the accompanying stress and anomie			1
like all major misfortunes , the current tragedy of @entity7 can be seen as a test , a chance to ask ourselves who we really are , what really matters as we rebuild , not only our wrecked hospitals and broken roads and fractured bodies , but our damaged identity			1
i believe that the deepest wells of that solidarity and fellowship i witnessed when the earthquake of 1960 reduced my land to rubble is still inside most of the people of @entity7 , and will constitute the main source of our efforts to lift our country up from its desolation , the reason why we may be able to once again prevail , as so many times in the past , against the forces of blind nature			1
fifty years ago , the people of @entity7 found a way to survive all that death and destruction and i can only hope that this time we can painfully , painstakingly , even joyfully , do it again			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

in 1960 , an earthquake shook @entity7 , the most powerful one ever recorded
@entity187 recalls that the quake brought @entity7 's people together to rebuild
he says the society has become much more prosperous and individualistic
@entity187 says nation 's " deepest wells " of solidarity , fellowship can help it rebuild again
