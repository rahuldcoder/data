@entity0 -- in a bid to end what it calls illegal riots , the @entity3 military will prohibit outsider access to areas in two occupied @entity10 villages one day a week , according to a statement explaining the move			1
" every week , violent , illegal riots take place in the area of @entity17 and @entity18 , during the course of which members of the security forces are wounded and heavy damage is caused to the security fence and to public property , " the @entity3 military statement read			2
" in an effort to prevent the inciters of these riots from reaching the area in which the riots take place , three weeks ago , @entity26 maj. gen. @entity25 signed an order designating the area between the fence and the villages of @entity17 and @entity18 as a closed military zone			2
" word of the @entity3 military order became public monday			1
for the past five years the two @entity41 towns have been home to weekly friday protests opposing @entity3 's separation barrier , the over- 700 - kilometer stretch of concrete wall and fence that separates @entity3 from the @entity10			1
the demonstrations have become a weekly ritual and the center of a nascent non-violent @entity41 resistance movement , which attract an assortment of @entity41 , @entity3 and international activists			2
however , the demonstrations often degenerate into clashes between @entity3 military personnel and stone - throwing youths			0
the protest sites will be closed between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. every friday for the next six months , but the closure does not apply to residents of the villages			1
the @entity61 issued a statement saying it " condemned the repressive actions by the occupation forces against peaceful demonstrations , as well as the declaration of @entity18 and @entity17 as closed military areas every friday for six months			0
" the cabinet " stressed the right of the @entity41 people , according to international laws , to defy occupation measures , settlement activities , and the building of the wall			0
" the move comes after months of increased @entity3 military activity in the form of night raids and arrests in the villages			0
residents and protest organizers also have decried the latest @entity3 military action , saying in a news release that it is part of a " persecution campaign against @entity41 activists in an attempt to suppress the rising tide of @entity10 popular resistance to the occupation			1
" speaking to @entity1 last month , @entity93 , a spokesman for the @entity3 military , acknowledged @entity3 army activity in the towns and said @entity3 has the responsibility to deal those who were leading the protests			2
" if those people who are organizing it from even behind the scenes , they can not be above the law , and that 's what we 're dealing with			0
" @entity108 , a lawyer representing village residents , said the military order is illegal and argued that " closed military zone orders are not meant to deal with demonstrations , which are clearly in the civic rather than the military realm			1
" according to the @entity41 activist group @entity116 , six protesters have been killed in the demonstrations since 2008			0
the @entity3 military says more than a hundred of its soldiers have been wounded .			0
