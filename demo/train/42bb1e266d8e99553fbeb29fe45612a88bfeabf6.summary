-- @entity2 fighters in @entity3 have seized another town on the border with @entity6 , consolidating their grip on a swath of northern @entity3			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) took control of the town of @entity12 at the end of last week , further tilting the balance away from more moderate factions of the @entity16			1
if @entity9 's record elsewhere is any guide , the people of @entity12 can expect the imposition of strict @entity9 customs , with women and girls being coerced to dress more conservatively and @entity24 , or religious , courts being established to dispense justice			1
opposition activists say @entity9 has cut down a famous landmark -- an ancient oak tree -- near @entity12			1
the militants claimed people had been worshipping the tree rather than @entity34 , an allegation rejected by locals , according to the @entity37			0
rebels : @entity3 airstrikes kill at least 40 the loss of @entity12 will make it more difficult for brigades of the @entity16 to bring in supplies from @entity6 and get wounded fighters across the border to hospitals			1
it also may worsen the plight of internally displaced @entity3 who have swollen the population of this northern corner of the country			2
another jihadist group now controls one of @entity3 's main oilfields , according to the observatory			2
it says @entity57 ( @entity58 ) took over the @entity60 field over the weekend , though an industry source said the rebels ' lack of technical expertise and damaged infrastructure would make it difficult for them to extract the crude			0
@entity9 and @entity58 have made substantial gains in @entity3 in recent months			1
in an article for the forthcoming edition of @entity72 , the journal of the @entity74 , @entity69 argues that @entity9 and other jihadist groups are more dangerous in @entity3 than they ever were in @entity76 -- " more likely to sustainably control territory , project power around the region , possibly sponsor global terrorist attacks , and catalyze a new generation of jihadist insurrection			1
" they " now include up to 12,000 fighters combined , " @entity69 says			0
" the @entity9 is also bringing in much larger numbers of foreign fighters , including approximately 900 @entity87 , many of whom are learning to use sophisticated weapons and small unit tactics			2
" he adds : " not only are far more foreign fighters entering the conflict , they are playing much more complex roles as fighters and commanders rather than simply as fodder for suicide attacks			0
considering that the most important role of a veteran jihadist is as a trainer and motivator , this outflow is worrisome			0
" @entity9 's videos posted online highlight the contribution of foreign fighters from @entity109 , @entity110 and across the @entity112 world and @entity87			0
last week , it posted a photograph of a 17 - year - old @entity116 citizen killed while fighting in its ranks			0
its rise to prominence will not upset the @entity3 government			0
president @entity122 has frequently characterized the rebels as terrorists associated with @entity2 , and infighting among rebel groups , @entity128 and @entity130 militia in the north works in the regime 's favor			1
activists say the group that had previously held @entity12 , @entity134 , had spent so much effort battling other @entity16 factions that it was helpless to defend the town			1
for the @entity142 and other western governments , @entity9 's expansion to north and eastern @entity3 , especially @entity140 and @entity141 provinces , is alarming			1
seven years ago , the @entity142 committed tens of thousands of troops and billions of dollars to rolling back @entity2 in @entity76			0
the famous ' surge ' succeeded in buying time and space for more moderate forces , but the militants -- battered and bloodied -- clung on			0
now they have space in @entity3 , where @entity142 @entity150 and military technology are absent			0
@entity69 , who is a fellow at the @entity152 , says , " although the worst fears of @entity76 in 2006 were avoided , they have the potential to be realized in @entity3 , " not least because jihadist groups benefit from the tolerance or even support of " close @entity142 allies such as @entity6 , which has allegedly backed @entity58 skirmishes against @entity130 in @entity3 , and @entity161			1
" @entity3 's brutal war within a war gains momentum both @entity9 and @entity58 have been involved in attacks against @entity130 militia in northern @entity3 , with several vehicle - borne suicide attacks in recent days			1
but @entity69 says @entity6 's policy of using jihadist groups as a counterbalance to @entity130 ambitions in @entity3 is " inane			1
" " obviously @entity6 has had a long fight with @entity130 groups , but toleration of @entity2 is always a bad idea , " he says			1
" these groups can not be controlled , and they contain elements that measure success in completely brutal ways			0
" @entity9 seems supremely confident of its destiny and has even defied the overall leader of @entity2 , @entity183 , who earlier this year instructed it to confine its operations to @entity76			1
rather than cede the lead role in @entity3 to @entity57 , as @entity183 ordered , @entity9 last week called for " all jihadist leaders and soldiers and people to accelerate in joining the project of the @entity9			1
" its " project " is @entity9 rule in areas it controls			0
@entity9 has posted videos online showing its members staging games for children and providing social services , but it has also coerced women and girls into wearing the veil and gloves in public			0
according to the @entity37 , it has introduced @entity9 dress for schoolchildren and banned men from teaching girls			0
@entity69 says the group has used " internal discipline and good pr efforts to control the darker aspects of its nature , but that is a temporary fix			0
the group continues to espouse radical ideological concepts ( even by @entity2 standards )			2
" @entity69 told @entity0 that while @entity9 and @entity58 collaborate on the battlefield , they have different aims and ideologies			0
" @entity58 represents the newest breed of @entity2 franchises , which tend to blend nationalist and jihadi goals , " he said			0
" @entity9 on the other hand is the most direct descendant of @entity232 and the violence - first , absolutist strain of @entity2			2
the conflict between these groups is indicative of larger tensions in the @entity2 enterprise			2
" @entity57 has joined forces with other @entity241 groups both to strengthen itself against @entity9 and because it " wants to win @entity3			1
@entity9 wants to win globally and the @entity3 borders mean far less to it , " @entity69 told @entity0			2
within the fractured and increasingly discouraged rebel movement , both jihadist groups are assuming larger roles , with disturbing implications for @entity3 's future			2
@entity2 - linked rebels mistakenly behead fellow fighter , rebel group say			2

terrorist groups are consolidating power in northern @entity3 , watch groups say
@entity2 *offshoot* took @entity12 on @entity6 border , which will impede @entity16
group is imposing strict @entity9 *law* ; *takeover* benefits @entity122 regime
