-- if those coveted 20 - something readers ca n't identify with @entity2 , maybe they will with " @entity3			1
" @entity4 will appear in the november issue of @entity6 as the magazine 's first cartoon cover model			1
like nearly everything printed on paper these days , @entity6 has been facing tough times			2
advertising pages have dropped 31 percent over the last year , newsstand sales have dried up by 25 percent , and its circulation has dipped to 2.4 million , according to publishing insider @entity15			0
can a blue - haired mother of three deliver the iconic gentleman 's book to a new generation ? part commemoration of " @entity3 ' " 20th anniversary , part nod to the golden days of @entity6 , what has become known as " the @entity22 " has drummed up more attention for @entity6 than the premiere of the original " @entity28			1
" but it remains to be seen whether the animated move can open the wallets of a younger generation			0
" the shock value always does @entity6 very good , " said @entity15 online editor - in - chief @entity33			1
" this is a novelty one , but it 's no different than a celebrity			0
in a sense , @entity4 has something in common with a woman who 's never done it before , someone like @entity43			2
" but it 's not exactly shock value @entity6 is going for -- more like " hip , cool " and the kind of magazine a 25 - year - old would read			1
@entity49 , a " lad mag " with an average reader of 29 , also ran a cover of @entity4 in 2004 , depicting the d'oh - eyed beauty in a sheer dress on all fours , scrubbing the floor			1
" we knew @entity4 's pictorial would appeal to a large demographic , " said @entity6 editorial director @entity57			1
" this cover and pictorial is just another example of how we 're evolving our editorial content to continue to reach men in their 20s , and also maintain the elements of the magazine that have attracted readers for more than 50 years			2
" the three - page pictorial , featuring a scantily - clad @entity4 in cartoon lingerie , was " obviously tongue - in - cheek , " new @entity6 ceo @entity72 told the @entity73			1
" it had never been done , and we thought it would be hip , cool and unusual			0
" @entity6 's use of " hip " is n't the only thing retro - cool -- the cover is a clear nod to the empire 's peak in the 1970s			1
@entity4 's now infamous image , itself considered to be groundbreaking as the first cartoon character to land a @entity6 cover , was inspired by another bunny - eared milestone : the october 1971 issue featured @entity89 , the first black woman to pose on a @entity6 cover			1
@entity89 's picture on the october 1971 cover served as the inspiration for @entity6 's november 2009 cover			1
" we decided to re-create [ it ] because it 's one of our most iconic covers , " @entity57 said , " and because @entity4 's sexy blue beehive immediately made us think of @entity89 , whose beautiful , voluminous hairdo was front and center on the october 1971 cover			1
" for @entity2 , " @entity4 is the quintessential girl next door who stole our hearts 20 years ago and has held them captive ever since			2
we were delighted to learn she wanted to grace the pages of our magazine			0
her pictorial is truly stunning , " he told @entity0			0
this move comes on the heels of a disappointing first half of 2009 , during which @entity6 lost some attention from the demographic it does have -- the average reader is a 35 - year - old male			2
the magazine came in 200,000 short of its 2.6 million rate base -- the minimum circulation a magazine promises to advertisers -- according to @entity120			0
@entity6 's lackluster showing as of late can be attributed to two things , @entity33 said			1
one , the audience transferred some of their desire for tastefully disrobed women to the @entity128			0
second , @entity2 got old			0
" the reason for their audience shift can be seen in @entity2			0
i went to college in the ' 70s and @entity2 was in his 40s back then			0
he was the symbol for what kind of guy i wanted to be , " @entity33 said			0
" now he 's in his 80s -- it 's hard to identify with someone like that			0
that 's a problem for @entity6			2
" but , @entity57 said , " @entity6 is a state of mind and a way of being , not a pre-prescribed age			2
we knew this was something that all of our readers would enjoy , because the show has been on for 20 years and it resonates with adults of all ages			0
" the " @entity4 " - ized @entity6 will be available at newsstands friday .			1

@entity6 teams up with " @entity3 " to capture a younger audience
the november issue features a three - page pictorial of @entity4 and an interview
the cover was inspired by an iconic 1971 cover , the editorial director says
@entity165 will tell if the cover 's impact will help turn around @entity6 's drop in circulation
