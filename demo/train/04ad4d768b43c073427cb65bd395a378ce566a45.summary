-- mid-april marks the anniversaries of several horrendous attacks in recent @entity4 history : -- april 19 , 1993 : the @entity6 's siege of the @entity8 compound leaves 76 dead			1
-- april 19 , 1995 : the bombing of a federal building in @entity11 kills 168 people			1
-- april 20 , 1999 : a mass shooting at @entity14 leaves 15 dead			0
-- april 16 , 2007 : the @entity17 massacre kills 33			0
the @entity11 bombing was timed to coincide with the @entity8 anniversary			1
and it 's unclear whether the @entity14 shooters timed that attack to mark @entity24 's birthday or possibly @entity8			1
is there something about this time of the year that makes these types of attacks more prevalent ? for an answer , @entity0 spoke with @entity31 , a professor at the @entity32 in @entity33			1
he teaches a course examining conspiracy theories and runs a blog , called @entity37			1
@entity0 : is there any evidence or are there any theories that suggest attackers are more likely to strike around this time of the year ? @entity31 : i have seen nothing to suggest that anything about april itself makes people violent			1
that said , the reason why we see certain types of political violence in mid- to late april is because of a few unhappy coincidences : that @entity8 happened to fall on the anniversary of the @entity55 , the first battles in a war against a tyrannical oppressor			1
for many people who labor under the idea that the federal government is a tyrannical foreign oppressor like the @entity63 monarchy , @entity8 symbolizes a war of a government against its people			2
[ @entity70 ] @entity69 chose to bomb the @entity71 [ in @entity11 ] on the anniversary of @entity8 because of that symbolic importance ( indeed , the forged drivers license he rented the truck with had the date of issuance as 19 april 1993 , the date of the @entity80 fire )			1
if you want to squint , you might also lump in the opening of the @entity83 to this part of the year , but the timing of that was chronologically tied to events following @entity89 's election , not the @entity90			0
regarding the @entity17 shootings , my first impression is sheerest coincidence			2
now , by raising this question , i think that you illustrate an important principle behind the conspiratorial mindset ( something that actually undergirds even normal psychology ) , and that is seeing patterns in unrelated events			0
seeing a cluster of completely unrelated events fires up the conspiracy theorist 's mind			2
i have recently seen speculation about four different television personalities who recently have displayed incoherent speech during taping ( including a news reporter and @entity109 )			2
conspiracy theorists made the leap that they were all related and that there was probably some mind - control weapon being used			2
@entity0 : how strong are the beliefs / outrage surrounding the @entity8 disaster , nearly 20 years after the siege ? @entity31 : i do n't have a sense of the strength of the feelings about @entity8 specifically ; however , after @entity11 , the numbers of militia groups dropped			1
following the election of [ @entity127 ] @entity126 , however , there was a steep rise in the number of hate groups , which has been ably tracked by the @entity131 and the @entity132			0
interestingly , last year on the 19th of april , gun advocates had a rally in @entity135 ( a sort of " bring your guns to the @entity139 day " ) to rally behind the @entity140 , even though the @entity140 has not really been on the @entity126 administration 's radar at all			0
for a while , it was difficult to even buy ammunition , since terrified gun owners started stockpiling it			0
nonetheless , in the mythology that has grown up around @entity8 and @entity11 among self - identified patriots , the 19th has become a sort of high holiday for those who think that they live under the thumb of a tyranny			1
@entity0 : what do you think is behind the need to see patterns in unrelated events , such as several attacks that happened all around the same time ? in other words , what purpose do conspiracy theories serve ? @entity31 : there are several possible answers , and i 'm not sure any one answer is better than any other answer			1
people are extremely social critters , and part of what makes that possible is the ability to perceive others as deliberately acting in the world , in other words to detect agency			0
it 's extremely useful in building respectful communities			0
sometimes that faculty does n't turn off when it should , and you associate " agency " with events and ideas that are unrelated			0
when a responsible agent is not easily discernible , that sense that something is still deliberate endures , and you are left wondering , " well , who caused it , then ? " you fill in the blanks			0
conspiracy theories are a contemporary mythology , not unlike the @entity200 gods			1
everything that happens has a reason , and the gods affect the course of human events through direct intervention			2
the ill - defined " they , " whether referring to the @entity206 , @entity207 , international bankers , @entity209 or interdimensional shapeshifting reptilian space aliens living in the hollowed - out artificial moon ( yeah , it 's a real one ) , really seem to me to be a secular version of religious mythology			2
on the other side , when you are already convinced that agents are working to manipulate world events , people tend to seek out information that reinforces what they already believe			0
it 's a tendency called confirmation bias , and it is a sort of perceptual filter for what you accept as evidence			0
even the apparent clustering of events , in itself , can serve as evidence for someone who is looking for things to confirm their worldview , and allows the conspiracy theorist to discount reams of information that directly refute that belief			0
each human brain comes equipped with a whole series of generally useful shortcuts to help us make sense of the immense amount of information that we have to process everyday			0
conspiracy theories , i suspect , are simply an interesting ( occasionally dangerous ) byproduct of those mental shortcuts .			1

several @entity4 tragedies happened in mid-april , including @entity8 and @entity11
while some are related , @entity31 says others are just a coincidence
@entity31 teaches course on conspiracy theories at @entity32
he says conspiracy theories are " a contemporary mythology , not unlike the @entity200 gods "
