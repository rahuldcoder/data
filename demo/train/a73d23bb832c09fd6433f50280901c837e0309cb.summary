@entity0 -- on the night vice presidential candidate @entity3 made his debut on the national stage , the @entity2 turned its attention to @entity8 's influence abroad and what the party sees as president @entity12 's failed economic policies			1
the roster of speakers at the @entity15 boasted two of the party 's foreign policy heavy hitters and rhetoric designed to appeal to voters who are still undecided			1
here are five things we learned from the convention 's second night : 1			2
@entity26 's enforcer comes to play on tuesday , the @entity2 convention was about love ( @entity30 ) and respect ( @entity32 )			1
but to the chagrin of head - scratching republicans eager to take the fight to president @entity12 , there was n't much talk in the @entity38 about the current administration in @entity40			0
@entity3 put those anxieties to rest on wednesday with a lengthy , aggressive and systematic attack on @entity12 's record in office , with one question as the thesis : " without a change in leadership , why would the next four years be any different from the last four years ? " @entity3 , criticized by @entity49 as the architect of a budget plan that would gut @entity52 , went on offense on the issue in the heart of retiree - heavy @entity56			2
" the greatest threat to @entity52 is @entity59 , and we are going to stop it , " he said			0
there were also flashes of biography as the @entity66 congressman tried to introduce himself to a country still learning about @entity26 's running mate			1
but it was clear from his sharpened rhetoric that the @entity26 campaign sent @entity3 onstage to make the case against @entity12			1
he described @entity59 as a cold " power play , " condemned @entity75 as " cronyism at its worst " and said the president is " forever shifting blame			0
" then there was this line , sure to be remembered for its trenchant appeal to younger voters who had hoped for more from @entity12 : " college graduates should not have to live out their 20 's in their childhood bedrooms , staring up at fading @entity12 posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life			2
" responding in a statement , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity89 said @entity3 " offered @entity8 40 minutes of vitriol and a half - dozen previously debunked attacks , but not one tangible idea to move this country forward			0
" @entity3 : @entity96 leadership missing 2			0
on weak spots , let surrogates shine @entity2 ' nearly singular focus on the economy took a back seat wednesday when sen. @entity102 and former secretary of state @entity103 took the stage to talk foreign policy , a topic @entity26 makes little mention of on the stump and that has been largely absent from the national political debate			1
@entity26 faces a solid foreign policy record from the current president , who voters consistently say in polls would better handle @entity8 's relationships with other countries if re-elected			1
in the latest @entity1 / @entity118 survey released earlier this week , president @entity12 had a 51 % -44 % advantage over @entity26 on foreign policy			1
facing those facts , the @entity26 campaign chose wednesday to use conservatives with well - established foreign policy credentials to make the case that @entity12 has failed a test of leadership in key international hot spots , including in @entity128 and @entity129			1
" unfortunately , for four years , we 've drifted away from our proudest traditions of global leadership , traditions that are truly bipartisan , " @entity102 said			1
" we 've let the challenges we face , both at home and abroad , become harder to solve			0
we ca n't afford to stay on that course any longer			0
" @entity136 echoed many of the same themes			1
the former secretary of state said @entity26 and @entity3 " know that our friends and allies must again be able to trust us , " what she said was @entity12 's weakness on the international stage			1
yet even @entity136 turned back to the economy , saying when the world looks at the @entity8 , " they see an @entity8 government that can not live within its means			1
" @entity136 and @entity102 's remarks were a brief side track to a convention overwhelmingly focused on blaming @entity12 for the weak economy and how @entity26 plans to fix it			1
as @entity15 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity156 noted , neither campaign thinks foreign policy will make a big difference to voters struggling with high unemployment and stagnant wages			1
" it 's not going to matter at the end , " @entity156 said			2
" both campaigns , i think , but especially the [ @entity26 ] campaign , wants to move on to the economy			1
and @entity12 now has the experience , four years as commander - in - chief			0
so i put that is a plus for the @entity49 in the fall			0
" @entity102 : ca n't have security threatened 3			1
@entity176 does matter four years ago , as they were battling for the 2008 @entity15 presidential nomination , @entity178 questioned @entity26 's @entity182 faith			1
four years later , as he addressed the @entity15 convention in prime time , the former @entity184 governor had a very different message			0
" i care far less as to where @entity26 takes his family to church than i do about where he takes this country , " said @entity178 , who still wields influence among social conservatives			1
some in that key component of the @entity15 base still harbor suspicions of @entity26 's faith			1
while this convention is supposed to focus mostly on the economy , and while @entity178 did attack @entity12 over his handling of the issue , he did made the case for why social conservatives need to rally around their party 's presidential nominee			1
" let me clear the air about whether guys like me would only support an evangelical			0
of the four people on the two tickets , the only self - professed evangelical is @entity12 , and he supports changing the definition of marriage , believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb or even beyond the womb , and tells people of faith that they must bow their knees to the god of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what he calls health care , " he said			2
@entity15 strategist @entity229 said that social conservatives are extremely committed to beating @entity12			0
" the important thing @entity26 needs to do is moving them from being voters in november to being activists			1
" " and the difference is showing and voting and making phone calls , putting bumper stickers on their cars , and frankly that 's where a @entity178 , a @entity241 , and others , make it so vital , because they 're out there on the front lines with social conservatives saying ' the war is now			1
this is the most important election in our lifetime			0
we have to win and we have to get active behind @entity26			2
' " how faith will matter at the @entity15 4			2
@entity103 : a star is born @entity26 advisers gave @entity103 rave reviews earlier this summer after she addressed a room of @entity15 donors and @entity2 officials at a closed - door campaign confab in @entity260 , @entity261			1
on wednesday , the country got a glimpse of the political skills and stage presence that may have prompted @entity266 to float @entity136 as a potential running mate in a buzzed - about leak to the @entity269 in july			1
the former secretary of state under @entity271 and current @entity273 professor showed off her foreign policy acumen with a fluent ( if somewhat predictable ) defense of @entity8 's role in the world			1
" my fellow @entity8 , we do not have a choice , " she said			0
" we can not be reluctant to lead , and one can not lead from behind			0
but it was @entity136 's tribute the @entity8 dream , the second half of her speech was laced with nods to her personal story and difficult upbringing in segregated @entity290 , that had the convention crowd and political watchers mesmerized			1
" @entity8 has a way of making the impossible seem inevitable in retrospect , " she said			0
" but of course it has never been inevitable			0
it has taken leadership , courage and an unwavering faith in our values			0
" her speech set @entity305 alight			1
" lump in throat , " said @entity56 @entity2 operative @entity306			2
" the birth of a candidate , " tweeted @entity309 editor @entity308			0
" a memorable speech , " political analyst @entity312 wrote			0
" @entity136 : @entity8 ca n't lead from behind 5			2
@entity26 and @entity3 do n't see @entity315 to @entity315 if you thought that @entity26 and his running mate are always on the same page , they 're not			2
@entity3 highlighted where the @entity2 ticket splits : on their playlists			2
the first member of @entity325 on a presidential ticket pointed out one of the biggest differences in his vice presidential acceptance speech			0
" we 're a full generation apart , gov. @entity26 and i , " @entity3 said			2
" and , in some ways , we 're a little different			0
there are the songs on his @entity315 , which i 've heard on the campaign bus			0
and on many hotel elevators			0
he actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies			0
i said , i hope it 's not a deal - breaker , @entity340 , but my playlist starts with @entity342 and ends with @entity343 , " said @entity3			0
@entity3 was obviously having some fun , but there 's a serious side to his comments			0
by highlighting their differences over music , @entity3 also emphasized his youth			0
it was accentuated by the 42 - year - old congressman 's wife and young children joining him on the stage following his speech			1
and that infusion of youth on a ticket headed by someone in his mid- 60s could help			0
@entity3 spoke the word " generation " a number of times in his address , at one point saying " i accept the calling of my generation to give our children the @entity8 that was given to us , with opportunity for the young and security for the old , and i know that we are ready			0
" with national and state polling indicating that @entity12 holds a large advantage among younger voters over @entity26 , @entity3 can only help			2
" we 've got our first rock ' n ' roll @entity15 on a national ticket			0
and that 's something @entity26 lacked , " @entity156 said			1
" @entity26 had n't made the case yet about taking this campaign into the future			2
@entity12 's saying that @entity26 wants to go back			1
@entity3 is evidence that this party wants to move forward			0
" ' gen xer ' @entity3 takes up @entity2 torch , makes case to young voters			2

@entity102 and @entity136 took to stage to underscore @entity2 foreign policy
@entity178 , who once questioned @entity26 's @entity182 faith , sang his *praises*
@entity103 's speech won raves both in the forum and on @entity305
