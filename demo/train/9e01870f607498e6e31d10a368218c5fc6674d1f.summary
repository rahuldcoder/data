-- the @entity1 appeared on " the @entity2 " on february 9 , 1964 , 50 years ago next month			1
here are five things you need to know to understand @entity5 and the significance of that performance			0
who was @entity9 ? @entity9 was not what you think of as a tv personality			1
he was a baggy - eyed , malaprop - mouthed , stiff - bodied former newspaper columnist who looked like @entity13			0
a wall had more charisma			0
could @entity5 happen today ? but he was the perfect host			0
he said his introductions and got out of the way			0
his guests were the stars -- and he could book almost everybody , thanks to his deep contacts			0
you might compare his show to an hour of web - surfing			0
it featured everybody from plate - spinners to comedians to theatrical performances to pop stars , all in one place			0
" the @entity2 , " originally called " @entity2 , " went on the air in 1948 and lasted for 23 years			2
were @entity1 really unknown in @entity34 ? not completely			2
in @entity36 , they 'd had no. 1 singles for several months , starting with " @entity38 " in february 1963 , and by fall @entity5 was in full swing			0
( the word " @entity5 " first gained wide currency in october after the band 's performance on a major @entity45 tv show , " sunday night at the @entity46			1
" ) @entity9 first encountered the band by accident -- he was stuck at @entity46 's @entity50 when they returned from @entity51 to thousands of fans on october 31 -- but the group was on the show 's radar before then , @entity9 staffer @entity47 says			1
the show put out a press release about @entity1 ' three - show booking in mid-december , and @entity59 ran a small item in its december 28 , 1963 , issue			1
the @entity1 had also appeared in several @entity34 news reports			2
did you get swept up in @entity5 ? share your memories here in december , the band 's @entity34 label , @entity67 , started a marketing blitz -- " the @entity1 are coming ! " -- and by january their songs were all over the radio			2
" @entity71 " hit no. 1 in the @entity34 on february 1 , dethroning balladeer @entity74 's " there ! i 've said it again			0
" but for all that , @entity1 had n't performed in @entity34			2
with the @entity9 show , they had one of the biggest stages in the country			1
who was there ? @entity84 received 50,000 requests for the 728 seats in @entity88 's @entity87 50 , since renamed the @entity89 and now home to " the @entity91 with @entity92			0
" among the celebrities who attended either the live show or the dress rehearsal : @entity97 and @entity96 ( @entity99 's daughters ) @entity100 ( talk - show host @entity102 's daughter ) and @entity104 and @entity105 ( @entity13 's daughters , invited by @entity100 )			0
also there : future @entity107 , who performed with the cast of " @entity110 ! " 4			1
it was n't just @entity1 ? no. the band played two sets , opening the show with " @entity116 , " " @entity112 " and " she loves you " and returning with " @entity119 " and " @entity71			1
" in between , acts included magician @entity121 , impressionist ( and future " @entity123 ) @entity124 , comedians @entity126 & @entity127 , @entity129 singer @entity128 , @entity131 star @entity130 and the " @entity110 ! " cast , and acrobats @entity133 & the @entity135			0
what happened after the show ? though the audience loved them and millions of new fans were created that night , some reviewers were less enthusiastic			0
" the cynical turnover in teen - age trauma received recognition last night in the businesslike appearance of @entity1 on the ' @entity2 , ' " wrote the unimpressed @entity142 tv critic @entity141			1
the ratings , however , were spectactular : 45.3 % of @entity34 tv households tuned in , representing 73 million people -- a record for an entertainment program up to that time			2
from @entity88 , @entity1 took a train to the nation 's capital , where they played at the @entity155 on february 11 , then returned to @entity88 for two @entity157 concerts on february 12			1
then it was off to @entity159 for the group 's second @entity9 appearance -- a performance at @entity164 's @entity163 on february 16			1
the ratings for the second @entity9 show were almost as good as the first			1
on february 22 , @entity1 returned to @entity36 , where they were greeted by 10,000 fans at @entity50			2
the third @entity9 appearance , taped before the february 9 show , aired the next day .			1
