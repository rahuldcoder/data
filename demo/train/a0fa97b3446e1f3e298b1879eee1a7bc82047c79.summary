@entity0 , @entity1 -- high above the beaches in @entity0 's hillside slums , you can get some of the best views in town			1
and now , they come from some of the cheapest rooms as well			2
with the @entity13 less than four months away , residents in many once infamous favelas are opening their doors to tourists , renting beds , rooms or even entire houses , and building youth hostels			1
" if you want to see the @entity13 , see some football matches and experience true @entity1 life you should really check this out , " says @entity20 , a @entity21 backpacker staying at a hostel in the @entity24 shantytown			1
beds at hostels in @entity31 and @entity32 beaches , which usually go for around $ 40 a night , are expected to cost as much as $ 400 during the @entity13			1
hotels are even more expensive , with many requiring multiple - night stays			0
but a bunk at @entity36 will set guests back just $ 65 -- four times the usual price , but still a relative bargain			0
of course , visitors staying in @entity0 's favelas will likely be confronted with more than just a modest room			1
garbage in these areas often piles up along the roads , while electricity , water and sewage services are spotty at best			0
the biggest concern , though , is security			1
just a few years ago , @entity0 's favelas were controlled by drug lords			1
police have since stormed many of them , in a process dubbed " pacification , " driving out armed gangs in an effort to make it relatively safe for residents and visitors			0
but they 've had mixed results			0
periodic gun battles continue in many favelas			0
just last week , drug traffickers shot at police posts in @entity67 , one of the biggest shantytowns in @entity0			2
@entity70 says she could hear the recent shootouts from her terrace			0
she rents rooms in her bright yellow house to foreign tourists and says safety depends on knowing where not to go and following rules			2
" do n't use drugs , do n't bring girls home , keep it a nice environment , " she says			0
a @entity84 native , @entity85 has launched a website with an eye on the @entity13 allowing residents to rent out rooms to foreigners			1
with some 600,000 foreign fans expected over the course of the tournament , there could be plenty of demand			1
but @entity85 believes that many of those looking for rooms will be attracted by more than just the about $ 50 price tags on many rooms			1
" they want more authentic , lively , meaningful experiences , " he says			0
" they want to see the real @entity0			2
" and , of course , those great views do n't hurt either			0
@entity108 stadium retains @entity13 status			2

staying at a hostel could cost as much as $ 400 a night during the @entity13
about 600,000 foreign fans are expected during the tournament
rooms in @entity0 's favelas could go for as little as $ 50 a night
