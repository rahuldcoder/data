-- people do n't generally care what politicians read			0
but rep. @entity4 is different			2
his fascination with the @entity7 - born novelist @entity6 could spell trouble for the @entity10 's new vice-presidential candidate			1
it could put him at odds with the @entity14 right and the @entity15			1
it all depends how much you believe that he is in the thrall of @entity6			2
@entity6 ( 1905 - 1982 ) is controversial because of the extremism of her views			1
in researching my recent book , i found that @entity6 's influence on the @entity26 , which dates back as far as her endorsement of @entity29 in 1940 , has been sharply growing , largely due to her vise - like hold on the imagination of the tea party and people like @entity4			1
@entity6 was the author of two best - selling novels , " @entity36 " and " @entity37			1
" these books , along with her other novels and essays , set forth an ideology which she called objectivism			0
her books have sold in the millions and appeal to people ranging from @entity48 entrepreneurs to the rock band @entity49			0
( @entity49 's lyricist and drummer , @entity53 , only this year renounced his interest in @entity6 , three decades after writing the songs her work inspired			1
) college students notoriously go through an " @entity6 phase " because her books emphasize self - reliance and breaking away from one 's parents			1
for most people , it 's a kind of literary infatuation			0
but for a few , @entity6 becomes a lifelong passion			2
@entity67 : why @entity4 ? what made her books controversial is not violence or sex , though both " @entity36 " and " @entity37 " have their share of bodice - ripping , but an extremist vision of @entity75 that celebrated greed and selfishness , rejected altruism as " evil " and opposed the fundamental tenets of @entity14 morality			1
( she was also a militant atheist who favored abortion			0
) @entity4 says that he read her books as a youth but was not influenced by her			2
in april , he gave an interview to @entity87 in which he repudiated @entity6 entirely			1
in the interview , he called reports of his adherence to @entity6 's views an " urban legend " and said that he was more deeply influenced by his @entity15 faith and by @entity93			1
but that 's not the way he was talking in 2005 , when he gave a speech to the @entity97 , a group dedicated to promoting @entity6 's beliefs			1
in that speech , @entity4 said , " i grew up reading @entity6 and it taught me quite a bit about who i am and what my value systems are and what my beliefs are			1
it 's inspired me so much that it 's required reading in my office for all my interns and my staff			0
" he went on to say that " the reason i got involved in public service , by and large , if i had to credit one thinker , one person , it would be @entity6			1
and the fight we are in here , make no mistake about it , is a fight of individualism versus collectivism			0
" @entity126 : @entity4 will shift the campaign dynamic @entity4 very succinctly summed up the @entity129 worldview in those remarks			2
@entity6 painted the world in stark terms , as a struggle between the individual and the collective			2
in " @entity36 , " which was published in 1943 , her hero was an architect , @entity136 , who pursued his vision despite opposition from the media and the architectural establishment			0
he dislikes money and status and is solely focused on seeing his vision expressed through his work			0
he even allows another architect to take the credit for a public housing project that he designed			0
but when the project is not built according to his wishes , he blows it up			0
the book was widely denounced as amoral when it came out , but it had enough wide appeal that it was adapted into a 1949 movie with @entity153 as @entity136 and @entity154 as his love interest			0
but the stir that it caused when it came out was nothing like the explosion of fury that greeted " @entity37 " when it was published in 1957			0
that book advanced her belief that laissez - faire capitalism , unsullied by government interference or regulation , was the only moral social system			0
unlike the sometimes impoverished architect in " @entity36 , " the heroes of " @entity37 " were millionaires and industrialists , depicted as a degraded class who had to strike to throw off the yoke of oppression			0
the heroes of that book included a noble railroad heiress , @entity175 , and a struggling steel tycoon , @entity176 , but they are overshadowed by a character who emerges toward the end , @entity179 , an inventor who leads the downtrodden 1 % on a strike			0
@entity181 : @entity4 and gen @entity10 @entity6 further expounded on her beliefs in essays that were published in her newsletters , and in anthologies with titles like " @entity190 " and " capitalism : the @entity192			1
" the latter , first published in 1966 , contained three essays by @entity195 , one of which argued forcefully against all forms of regulation , even building codes			0
these essays were published by @entity6 and reflected her thinking			2
his strident essays for that book , which he has never repudiated or withdrawn from publication , were echoed by his actions in the 1990s as a principal supporter of financial deregulation in his capacity as chairman of the @entity211			0
in a famous appearance before a congressional committee in 2008 , rep. @entity212 , @entity213 , asked @entity195 , " do you feel that your ideology pushed you to make decisions that you wish you had not made ? " @entity195 conceded that there was a " flaw " in his belief system , which was widely cited as a repudiation of @entity6 , who was his friend for 30 years			2
in april 2010 , appearing before the @entity224 , he denied that he had ever repudiated his ideology			0
" the flaw in the system that i acknowledged was an inability to fully understand the state and extent of potential risks that were as yet untested , " he said			0
@entity232 : why @entity75 does n't like @entity233 @entity195 did n't mention @entity6 by name , but in an interview that same month he was asked if the financial crisis was " an indictment of @entity6 and the view that laissez - faire capitalism can be expected to function properly , that markets can be trusted to police themselves ? " his response : " not at all			1
" @entity4 's effort to put daylight between himself and @entity6 also reeks of history - rewriting			1
certainly the speech he gave before the @entity97 in 2005 , in which he toed the @entity129 line , was no " urban legend			1
" @entity4 is no atheist , but atheism was at the core of her philosophy , because the teachings of the @entity256 simply do not jibe with her belief that selfishness is moral , greed is good and altruism is evil			2
it 's not surprising that @entity4 's budget plan , which cuts programs for the poor and middle class while imposing no new taxes on the rich , has been criticized by some in the @entity15			1
@entity4 can either be an objectivist or a @entity14			1
he ca n't have it both ways			0
he faces a serious problem among @entity272 , moderate @entity26 and others who dislike @entity6 's views if his expressions of support for @entity6 are believed , rather than his denials			1
how do you feel about @entity233 selecting @entity4 as his running mate ? share with us on @entity281			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity284 .			2

@entity6 was a @entity7 - born novelist whose work celebrated selfishness , says @entity284
in april , @entity4 called reports of his adherence to @entity6 's views an " urban legend "
but in 2005 @entity4 said she was " the reason i got involved in public service , " says @entity284
@entity284 : that could put @entity4 at odds with the @entity14 right and the @entity15
