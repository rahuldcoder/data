@entity0 , @entity1 -- the soul man howled into the microphone , his voice busting through the ceiling of the dimly lit @entity1 juke joint			1
he sang of love and sex , cheating scoundrels and lying fools			0
" ... doin ' the booooom booooom ! ... " he danced , he grooved			2
at times , his voice hit notes so high , the walls of the ramshackle place shook			0
" @entity17 got lungs ! " shouted one in the small crowd			0
soul wannabes enter juke joints with caution : stabbings and flat - out beatings have befallen artists who do n't meet expectations			1
yet on this night , not far from the fabled crossroads where , according to legend , bluesman @entity30 gained guitar mastery in exchange for his immortal soul , there was a most unexpected surprise : a @entity36 tore it up at one of the toughest joints in the @entity40			2
@entity41 sang for more than three hours for an audience of no more than 15			1
men named @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 nodded with approval			0
and word on the street was out : been a long time since somebody like the @entity52 has come through ! it 's been more than 18 months since that performance			2
the @entity52 is now hitting the big stage			0
signed by @entity58 last year , he and his band , the @entity56 loves , released their first album under a major label last week			1
the album , " @entity62 , " combines soul - ratcheting spunk with 1960s - style ballads			2
at its core is an age - old @entity68 tradition : lyrics of love and being driven wild by women			0
when he hits stride , @entity41 unleashes raw sexual energy through deep - bellied hollers , explosive bursts from his band and auctioneer - like rapidity			1
" ... there 's gon na be an explosion , baby			1
gon na be a- , gon na be a- , gon na be a- ... @entity82 ! ! ! ... " kicked back in his apartment in @entity85 , the 26 - year - old @entity41 laughs about how far he 's come			1
" there was a lot of very lucky coincidences that i fell into , " he says			0
and he 's got big - time backing			2
@entity90 , who has produced stars like @entity92 , dr. @entity93 and @entity94 , is the producer for " @entity62			1
" while @entity90 is best known for his hip - hop music production , he is ecstatic about this new gig			0
he first heard of @entity41 from a business partner about two years ago and then watched him on @entity98			1
" my jaw was on the floor			0
" " i played it for @entity102 and a couple other people			1
i was like , ' dude , you 've got ta check this kid out			1
' " blues , gospel and the ' strange cat ' the son of a former music critic , @entity41 got into music at an early age			1
by the time he was 13 , he was practicing the harmonica eight hours a day			0
he 'd cut up around the house with his father , who strummed the guitar while his son belted out			0
in high school , instead of poring over algebra books , @entity41 studied the likes of @entity121 and other @entity68 greats , listening to their tone , as well as the heart and soul they put into their music			1
he played saxophone and guitar in a jazz band in high school			2
when he performed , he wore his grandfather 's hat , and soon got dubbed " @entity52 " for his 1950s newsboy looks			2
shortly after high school graduation , at the age of 18 , the @entity138 kid from @entity139 , @entity140 , set out from his parents ' home to the heart of the nation 's blues country			1
he was heading to the @entity40 to work for a jumpstart blues radio station			0
but shortly after he arrived , his partner went broke			0
he was soon on stage at local juke joints , fronting a band and playing four hours a night			1
" i found myself thrust into it from the word go , playing all the time , " he says			0
" i pretty much immersed myself in this culture 24 hours a day			0
" he stayed in @entity1 for about a year before heading to the @entity158			0
but his real education was n't at the university ; it came on the @entity161 , where he teamed up with gospel singer @entity162 and began singing at her church			2
he says his skin color -- he was often the only white guy performing for crowds in @entity1 and @entity166 -- was never a hindrance			0
in fact , he says , african - americans often respected him more than whites did			0
" once people see that you 're enthusiastic and love the music and that i could sing ... everybody was very forgiving of it			1
" at juke joints , he says , the audiences were working - class folks " just there to have a good time			1
" they never got out of hand with him or the band , he pauses , " unless they 're really drunk			0
" when he gets a chance , he still goes back to @entity44 's , the first juke joint he ever played in @entity0			1
along the way , @entity41 has picked up fans from @entity188 to @entity189 to @entity190 of @entity191			1
earlier this year , @entity190 had @entity41 perform on his web show " live from @entity196 , " where musicians play along with @entity190 at his place in @entity195			1
@entity190 ranks @entity41 in the top 5 of those who have played on his show			1
" i look for unique people and i look for really talented people , and he fits that bill all the way , " @entity190 says			0
" the guy is a strange throwback of the time , but he does n't do it like an @entity208 impersonator			0
he 's the real thing			2
" @entity41 has since traded in his paperboy hat for a pompadour			1
his outfits now more resemble characters out of the hit tv show " @entity215			0
" @entity190 says he was so stunned by @entity41 's looks that he pulled out pictures from his youth to show the budding musician			1
" he was dressed in almost identical clothing as me , " @entity190 says , laughing			0
" he 's a strange cat			2
" but , he adds , of @entity41 's authentic style : " i do n't know how he does it , to tell you the truth			1
he 's a musical time traveler			2
" he 's doing something that nobody his age is doing			2
" the new album -- with most of its songs written by @entity41 -- was recorded live in @entity233 over 12 days			1
six days were spent tracking the rhythm section , and another six days to track the band 's horns and strings			2
" sonically , it stands up to anything that 's out there , " @entity90 says			2
like everything in the music business , the verdict is still out on if @entity41 catches on in the mainstream			1
to that end , @entity190 says that " there is no mainstream that matters " anymore			0
" it 's all about enthusiasm and fanaticism to your particular thing , " @entity190 says			0
" and that 's more important than being mainstream			0
it always was , really			0
" and there 's no doubt about @entity41 's soul			1
@entity190 and @entity90 say his audience will grow at the grass - roots level as more and more people hear his stuff			0
when they see him live , @entity90 says , " it 'll be a party from beginning to end			0
" @entity268 fans will get their first taste of that next tuesday , when @entity41 sings the national anthem at @entity271 .			1

@entity41 released his first album under a major label last week
@entity41 learned to sing in juke joints and gospel churches
@entity281 's producer *helped* bring stars @entity92 and dr. @entity93 to the world
" i played it for @entity102 . ... i was like , ' dude , you 've got ta check this kid out ' "
