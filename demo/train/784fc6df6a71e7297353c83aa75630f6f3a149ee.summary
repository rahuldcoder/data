-- when @entity2 photographed the heavily pregnant actress @entity3 for her private album , she never intended for that image to be seen by a wider audience			0
but the young editor @entity7 decided to put the picture on the cover of her magazine @entity10			1
more than two decades later , that very @entity10 cover is one of the most memorable images of our time			0
" i did n't expect the storm that it created , " @entity7 , now editor - in - chief of @entity18 and @entity17 , told @entity0			1
" it was a good risk because we put on an unbelievable amount of sales			0
it became a kind of iconic picture for women			0
" the cover was one of a series of bold and sometimes controversial decisions that have cemented @entity7 as one of the most influential magazine editors of a generation			1
the risks @entity7 has taken -- from adding celebrity culture to highbrow news magazines to ending the print run of @entity17 -- have brought both success and failure throughout her career			1
" unfortunately taking risks comes so easily to me that you can call it reckless at times , " said @entity7			2
" i have to hold myself back a little and think ' wait a minute , be careful because you know you can blow it , too			0
' " @entity50 - born @entity7 revived the fortunes of two ailing bastions of the newsstand , @entity10 , which she began editing aged just 30 , and @entity54			1
in the 15 years @entity7 edited @entity10 , she took its monthly sales from 200,000 to 1.2 million and is credited with saving the magazine with her signature formula of mixing serious news with celebrity culture			1
she again worked her magic at @entity54 , which she edited for six years , increasing circulation by 145 % on the newsstand and 28 % overall			0
in 1998 , she left @entity54 to launch @entity64 , which folded after only three years			0
her latest venture is perhaps the most controversial of all			0
@entity7 launched news website @entity18 -- named after the fictional newspaper in the @entity70 novel " scoop " -- in 2008 and merged it with @entity17 in 2010			1
while @entity18 is gaining a loyal digital readership -- with up to 16 million unique users a month and advertising up 30 % year on year -- @entity7 's @entity74 has yet to work on @entity17			1
like many weekly print magazines , circulation for @entity17 has slumped -- from three million in 2007 to 1.5 million in 2012			1
and after 80 years on the newsstand , @entity7 took the stark decision to make @entity17 an all digital publication , printing its farewell edition on december 31 , 2012			1
@entity81 lit up with # @entity82 , which also featured on the last cover of the magazine 's final edition			0
although it continues as an online magazine , its owner @entity86 has now announced it is seeking a buyer for the @entity17 brand			2
at the age of 59 , @entity7 is now running an all digital business for the first time in her career , and divides opinion on whether she can adapt her operation to meet the demands of a fickle online media world			1
" great editors have great successes and great failures , " says @entity99 , digital media analyst and author of @entity102 , " [ @entity7 ] had remarkable success with @entity10 and @entity54 , but @entity64 was a spectacular failure			1
" she is a ' tweener , ' connecting @entity50 and @entity109 sensibilities , connecting celebrity and serious news , connecting print and digital			2
there are not many people who have done that			0
" she has ridden with the times in creating @entity18 ; she is someone who adapts and learns			2
" others , however , see @entity7 as a great magazine editor of her time , and believe she has yet to master the digital media landscape			1
" she is a creature of a different age , " says @entity122 , media and technology staff writer at @entity125			0
" the formula she brought with her is the opposite of what works online			0
in the digital world , successful sites have started really small and gradually built up with unknown writers			2
her line was to hire expensive writers and do something with panache , but that does n't work online			0
" though she has her critics , @entity7 marks her own success by the fact that people are still talking about her			2
" i do n't think any editor wants to put out anything that falls into silence , " says @entity7			2
" i do tend to have points of view that are sometimes counter to the wind			0

bold moves have made @entity7 one of the most influential magazine editors of a generation
she ended print - run of @entity17 , making it an all digital magazine *alongside* news website @entity18
can she continue her magazine success in a digital media world ?
