@entity0 -- when @entity3 retired from professional basketball seven months ago , there were fears that interest in the @entity7 among @entity9 's 1.3 billion people would dwindle			1
but now the former @entity11 center -- one of the most successful overseas players in the league 's history -- could be forgiven for feeling like yesterday 's star in @entity9 thanks to @entity17 , the @entity19 - born @entity18 point guard with roots in mainland @entity9 and @entity21			1
" we have a lot of talented young athletes here who are passionate about basketball , " @entity3 told @entity1 in an interview wednesday			0
" they all want be the next @entity17			0
" i think they can relate more to @entity17 because they 're more common - sized			0
" for @entity3 , 31 , who stands at seven feet six inches ( 2.29 meters ) tall and remains a towering presence off court , @entity17 's natural talent more than makes up for his below average six - foot - three - inch ( 1.91 meters ) frame in the league			1
@entity36 : in @entity17 , @entity9 loves a winner " the easy part is to find a strong basketball player -- i have the size ; @entity41 : big and strong ; @entity42 , @entity43 , all those names , " he said			2
" @entity17 has basketball iq -- you ca n't program that			0
" he 's the kind of player i 'd like to play with if i 'm still a player -- he 's a team player and everybody likes the way he wins a game , " he added			0
" honestly , he did much more than i 'd expected			0
" @entity17 , 23 , only recently a little known back - up player sitting on the @entity18 bench , has been leading his team to a wave of recent victories without their established stars -- pulling off an average of 20 points and eight assists in six successive games			2
halfway across the globe , @entity17 's fan base on @entity65 , @entity9 's top micro-blogging site , has already hit the two million mark , four times the number of his followers on @entity71			1
inside the @entity73 stadium wednesday night , in between cheering @entity3 - owned @entity74 at a tight playoff game , local basketball enthusiasts gave a huge thumbs up to a player far from their court			2
@entity80 - demand ' in @entity9 " @entity17 is great , " one man gushed			2
" he plays so good -- lots of @entity9 love him			0
" another added : " he was born in @entity19 , but his blood is @entity9			2
" echoing this fan , @entity9 media -- to the chagrin of its @entity21 counterpart -- has been quick to claim @entity17 , whose parents emigrated from @entity21 but have family roots in mainland @entity9			1
the two sides split after a @entity9 civil war in the 1940s , but the @entity95 government regards @entity21 as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland			2
ever the sports diplomat , @entity3 has a simple answer to solve the contentious issue of @entity17 's identity : " he 's a great basketball player			1
" politics aside , comparisons between the two seem inevitable			0
@entity0 native @entity3 grew up in @entity9 's state - sponsored sports system and , amid much fanfare , was signed by the @entity11 in 2002 as the @entity7 's top overall pick			1
paid $ 93 million by the league during his nine - year career , @entity3 scored an average of 19 points per game and was voted an all - star player eight times			2
@entity17 , born and bred in @entity115 , was overlooked by most @entity7 teams before the @entity18 picked him			1
even with his new - found stardom , the @entity118 graduate earns much less than many of his teammates			0
despite their different paths to professional basketball , the two bonded through similar cultural experiences after meeting at an event for @entity3 's charity two years ago			1
" he gives a lot of hope to kids with the same background like his : asian - americans , second generation or maybe third , " @entity3 said of @entity17 's recent achievements			1
" they can follow his footprints and have more confidence in playing basketball			0
" while both have been called trailblazers , some argue it would be difficult for anyone to fill the void left by @entity3 , whose popularity helped the @entity7 franchise make huge inroads in the world 's most populous nation			1
" i do n't think anybody in the @entity7 , from the @entity9 perspective , will ever become a bigger star than @entity3 , " @entity7 commissioner @entity150 told @entity151 , the country 's official @entity152 - language newspaper , early this month			1
" @entity3 was the first , the biggest and the most successful -- and he will always have a special place in the heart of @entity7 and @entity9 fans			1
" " ( @entity17 's success ) was wonderful for our league ... but i do n't want to overburden him with expectations , " he added			1
" we have to see how he does in the next 300 games before we make any judgments			0
" @entity3 , however , appears to have made up his mind about @entity17			2
