-- the late house speaker @entity1 once said , " all politics is local			2
" certainly there is some truth to this in the @entity6			2
most practicing @entity6 experience the church through the parish they attend , and its sacramental life through the priests who minister there			0
those priests are ordained for a particular diocese that exists , along with others , within a particular geographic area administered by its local bishop			0
that bishop is named by the @entity19 , but it is the @entity21 in @entity22 that has major influence in determining who is selected as a bishop and where he is assigned to administrate			1
and this is where @entity28 is making his agenda felt this week			1
by removing the @entity33 @entity32 @entity31 and @entity34 from the @entity35 and appointing cardinal @entity36 , he is signaling the most radical kind of change -- one that will affect the church 's hierarchical structure from top to bottom			1
it is bishops who determine the tenor and emphases of local church communities			2
the @entity21 is being peopled by a different kind of person , who will implement @entity28 ' vision of a church governed as much by compassion as by orthodoxy			1
this is a big deal			0
while @entity31 champions traditional marriage , condemns abortion and cherishes fine vestments , @entity34 appeared less sensitive to the gravity of the priest - pedophilia tragedy , positions associated with @entity6 conservatives			2
by removing these men , @entity28 is shifting emphasis and establishing different priorities			1
but @entity36 is hardly a liberal			0
while the new bishop of @entity69 deviated from his predecessor 's practice of washing only men 's feet and included women at the @entity76 service , a gesture associated with @entity78 ' serving his disciples , he also accepted @entity22 's request to serve as coadjutor of the @entity82 when its bishop expressed views regarding homosexuality , divorce and the priesthood that @entity22 considered too liberal			0
he also was executive secretary of a papally mandated study of @entity33 seminaries			0
so he is not so easily pigeonholed as either liberal or conservative			0
he takes pastoral initiative , seeming to believe that " authentic power is service , " as @entity28 has said , but he is also a loyal son			1
described in a 2013 national catholic reporter article as " dead center of the bishops ' conference , " he is reported as saying , " in the pulpit we 're supposed to present the teaching with all of its unvarnished clarity , but when you step out of the pulpit , you have to meet people where they are and try to walk with them			2
" @entity28 has reconstituted the @entity21 for bishops beyond the replacement of two @entity33 prelates			1
all of his new appointments to the congregation , we may be sure , accord with his perspective : compassion and solidarity are at the forefront			1
he prioritizes the hopes and the anguish of the people he seeks to serve rather than abstract right teaching			0
consistent with @entity28 ' own witness to date and his efforts so far to renew the @entity128 ( the @entity129 bureaucracy ) , this appointment of carefully selected men to the @entity21 for bishops , men who share his priorities , may well be the most powerful tool available to him to effect far - reaching and sustained change -- in every parish throughout the entire world			1
in his book " @entity28 : why he leads the way he leads , " @entity138 begins each chapter with a quotation from @entity28			1
these speak eloquently to why @entity31 and @entity34 have been replaced , not for anything bad they have done but because of the new emphasis @entity28 desires to bring to his papacy			1
introducing " @entity149 " chapter : " today 's world stands in great need of witnesses , not so much of teachers but rather of witnesses			2
it 's not so much about speaking , but speaking with our whole lives			0
" perhaps this is why @entity28 shared his birthday breakfast tuesday with four homeless men			1
for chapter 4 , " @entity161 : @entity163 " : " this is a symbol , it is a sign			0
... washing feet means , ' i am at your service			0
' as a priest and as a bishop i must be at your service			0
" was it not at an @entity173 prison that @entity28 washed feet last holy thursday , including the feet of @entity177 girls ? a third and telling quotation is taken from @entity28 ' address to @entity181 bishops in july : " ( @entity182 ) nless we train ministers capable of warming people 's hearts , of walking with them in the night , of dialoguing with their hopes and disappointments , of mending their brokenness , what hope can we have for our present and future journey ? " no doubt @entity28 wants to guarantee that those who are appointed bishops are in accord with this perspective			1
@entity28 , as he has presented himself , is neither conservative nor liberal			1
he is not about ideology but about the @entity196			0
@entity197 comes readily to mind : feed the hungry , give drink to the thirsty , welcome the stranger , cloth the naked , care for the sick , visit those in prison -- as do the admonitions in @entity206 : " judge not , that you may not be judged , " and 1 @entity207 3:13 : " as the @entity210 has forgiven you , so you must also do			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity215 : @entity19 signals radical change by *upending* @entity21 of bishops
she says congregation helps pick bishops , who will implement @entity28 ' vision
she says mandate not about politics but compassion and solidarity with those served
@entity213 : this is powerful tool for him to effect far - reaching , sustained change around world
