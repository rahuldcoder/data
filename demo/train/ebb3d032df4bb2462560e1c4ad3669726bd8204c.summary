there is only one fairytale story in @entity3 soccer this season , but will it have a happy ending ? forget @entity7 's first league title for 18 years , disregard its city neighbor @entity9 concluding an exhaustive wait for " @entity11 " -- a 10th @entity13 crown			1
because this season is all about the " miracle of @entity15			1
" the @entity17 town has a population of just 27,000 and the club a budget dwarfed by almost all its rivals , yet back - to - back promotions have banked @entity15 a place in the big time			1
having already guaranteed a top - tier place , @entity15 also claimed the @entity3 second division title after second - placed @entity27 lost 3 - 1 at @entity28 on saturday			1
for the first time in its 74 - year history @entity15 will compete in @entity31 next season , rubbing shoulders with @entity9 and @entity34 as well as local rivals @entity35 and @entity37			1
" i do n't know if miracles exist but this is something close to a miracle , " @entity38 , club president since 2009 , told @entity39			2
however , amid all the emotion and reverence there is a bitter tinge , because like every famous fairytale fable , the threat of tragedy lurks in the background			2
despite being self - sustaining and completely free of debt -- unlike a host of other @entity3 clubs -- @entity15 could actually be relegated to the third tier of @entity3 football			1
a 1999 decree requires every team to have a capital equal to 25 % of the average expenses of all sides in the second division , excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest			1
that has hoisted the financial bar way above the head of @entity15 , which has responded by launching a share issue to raise the € 1.7 million ( $ 2.3 million ) needed to take a place at @entity3 's top table			1
unsurprisingly , @entity38 is unimpressed			0
while he runs an admittedly small but undoubtedly tight ship , the estimated combined debts of @entity9 and @entity34 amount to not far off € 1 billion ( $ 1.36 billion )			2
" even though we have a small budget , we have a different economic model to other clubs in @entity3 , " @entity38 told @entity39			1
" we have less expenses , fewer outgoings and we always have a small deficit			0
" this is something really strange in @entity3 because almost every team has huge debt , but in our case we have no debt			1
" we think it is really unfair because the law was established to assure that all those clubs with a lot of debt had a minimum capital value to attend to all their debts			0
" in our case we do n't have any debt			0
" ' special model ' the club 's story has struck a chord with football - loving people the world over , and support has been flooding in for its " @entity15 " campaign			1
over € 1.25 million ( $ 1.7 million ) has already been raised , the club 's tentacles spreading far and wide thanks to pledges from @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and many more countries			1
crucially , no investor can purchase more than € 100,000 worth of shares , ensuring @entity15 's principles are kept intact			1
" we want the team to remain for the people -- this is one of the ideas of our special model , " @entity38 explains			2
" we very much appreciate all the help we have had -- it has been surprising for us , a small club in a small town in the @entity17 mountains			1
" we have discovered that we have a story to tell and that people want hear stories like this , that we are fighting against this rule and we have achieved something big			0
" i hope we will get the money but we have to keep going -- if we relax it is the shortest way to failure			0
it will be difficult but we will get it			0
" humility and hard work the question of finance festering in the background has done little to dilute the delirium among @entity15 supporters , which pretty much counts as every single inhabitant of the town			1
since being formed in 1940 in the aftermath of the @entity147 , the club has never won a major trophy and only flirted with promotion to @entity31 once , in the 2004 - 05 campaign			1
a teenage @entity151 , now a star for the world champion @entity3 national side and @entity156 winner @entity154 , was among its ranks then , as was @entity158 , the club 's current manager			1
he has led the " @entity168 " to successive promotions , sticking steadfastly to a culture and identity that has long pervaded the club -- one that embodies the spirit of the tiny town that is equidistant from @entity37 and @entity167			1
" the secret to their success has been humility , hard work and above everything the spirit of the team , " says @entity169 , an @entity170 native who attended his first match at the age of four			2
" no - one is above any other			0
this is indicative of @entity15 's culture			1
the older players teach the younger players how to behave , how to work , how to be a team player			2
" these young guys when they become older , they will do the same			0
it is a culture that is passed down from generation to generation			0
" this year is a like a dream			0
under no circumstances did we imagine of getting to @entity31			1
this is a real miracle			0
" ' all for one , one for all ' @entity195 , a journalist with @entity196 , is similarly gushing about the class of 2013 - 14 and their achievements			0
" this is football and it is a dream machine			0
football is the only sport that allows such things , it would be impossible in basketball or athletics , " he told @entity39			0
" it 's a typical rags to riches story			2
i wrote in my newspaper @entity15 has been the @entity212 of the second division , with that famous catchphrase ' @entity215			1
' " there are no celebrities in this team , no millionaires			2
@entity220 is like the artist of the group , similar to @entity151 , who played at @entity170			0
" promotion may have brought unconfined joy to @entity170 , but aside from the financial conundrum , it has also thrown up a different web of problems			2
such is @entity15 's size and budget , that a summer overhaul is needed if it is to have a chance of holding its own against the best 19 teams in @entity3			1
" it will be so difficult next season because the competition is so different , " @entity195 said			0
" @entity15 will be the smallest town in the history of @entity31 , with the smallest budget			1
they will have to change 50 % of the team			2
they have a difficult summer ahead			0
" @entity9 and @entity34 play in another dimension and there are another set of clubs who play for @entity248			0
if they avoid relegation it will be the most important achievement of @entity15			1
" welcoming the superstars but that is for another day			0
now it is all about raising the money and daring to dream about life in @entity31 alongside the soccer elite			2
" the first day of the season will be very emotional			0
a day to talk about for all the days of your life , " @entity195 said			0
" it will be the happiest day of the season when @entity34 come to @entity262 , a historic day			0
" @entity9 played here in the cup some years ago , but not @entity34			0
you can imagine the emotion of watching @entity267 and @entity268 at @entity262			0
" @entity38 has barely had time to revel in the club 's achievements , being swamped with media requests from around the world as well as spearheading the " @entity15 " campaign			1
but the president is determined this historic opportunity wo n't see a shift in his club 's philosophy			1
" we wo n't go crazy wasting a lot of money on getting very expensive players , " @entity38 said			0
" we want to maintain our team philosophy and do things as we have been doing all these years			2
" we will try to adapt to the new situation but without getting crazy			0
we want to stick to our guns and be true to our history			2
" thanks to the record - breaking achievements of their players , it is a history that is becoming far more widely known .			2

@entity293 promoted to @entity31 for the first time in the club 's history
the @entity17 team will be the smallest to ever compete in @entity3 's top division
but financial rules *dictate* it must raise $ 2.3 million to avoid relegation instead
@entity15 is a town of just 27,000 in the @entity17 mountains near @entity37
