-- the undocumented immigrant population in the @entity2 rose to an estimated 11.7 million in 2012 , up from 11.5 million in 2011 , according to report released by the @entity3			1
the number includes those who crossed @entity2 borders illegally , as well as those who came in with temporary visas but stayed past their expiration date , @entity3 said monday about its estimate , based on @entity2 government data			1
@entity13 , director of @entity15 research at @entity3 and co-author of the study , says the data available can not point to a particular cause for the increase , but he says the improving @entity2 economy could be a factor			2
according to @entity3 , in 2007 , there were an estimated 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the @entity2			1
the number decreased to 11.3 million by 2009 , breaking a rising trend that had held for two decades			2
one reason for the decrease could have been the recession			0
in 2009 , the @entity30 , a @entity31 - based think tank that seeks a " pro-immigrant , low - immigration vision , " said @entity35 data indicated that more than 1 million undocumented immigrants left the previous year , a departure that began even before the nation 's economy took a turn for the worse			2
immigrants from @entity42 are still the largest group within the undocumented population -- 52 % as of 2012 -- but the number of recent @entity47 immigrants has decreased at higher rates than the general group			1
that signals a shift in the demographic makeup of those entering illegally into the @entity2			2
" they are coming from all parts of the world other than @entity42			0
@entity58 immigrants are a part of that , but so are immigrants from @entity62 and @entity63 , " @entity13 said			0
" the report points to border apprehension trends , too -- the number of @entity42 apprehended at the border by the border patrol is down in the last year or so			0
" @entity3 estimated there are now about 6 million @entity47 undocumented immigrants in the @entity2			1
@entity13 said that @entity72 states such as @entity73 and @entity74 have seen an increase in undocumented immigrants because their economies have fared better than @entity78 since the 1990s			1
@entity79 , a state that weathered the recession better than others , was the only state that did n't see a drop in undocumented immigrants in the past few years			0
according to @entity3 , its methodology " compares a demographic estimate of the number of immigrants residing legally in the country with the total number of immigrants as measured by a survey			0
" the difference is assumed to be the number of unauthorized immigrants in the survey , a number that is later adjusted for omissions from the survey			0
the new data could also affect the debate on a potential comprehensive immigration reform which has stalled in the @entity101 after the @entity102 approved a bill earlier this year that would provide a path to citizenship to those living here illegally			1
@entity0 's @entity108 contributed to this report .			0
