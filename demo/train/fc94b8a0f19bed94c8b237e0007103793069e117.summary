-- the @entity1 stood for " @entity2 "			1
and it certainly looked the part			0
a swivelling antenna that was said to detect everything from bombs to 100 dollar bills			0
a card that indicated what the device had found			2
in video recorded by @entity1 , the man behind the skyrocketing sales of @entity1 , police in @entity14 can be seen using the device searching for explosives by a live minefield			1
just one problem : it does n't work			0
@entity23 police say the @entity1 is really the " @entity24 " a novelty golf - ball finder with the label removed			1
this device , independent tests show , has no better than a random chance at finding a golf ball , much less a bomb			1

he uses sleight of hand , absurd sales tactics to actually con governments , officials , private individuals out of money to buy this device			2
" @entity51 spent less than 18 months as an entry level policeman in the @entity54 area before becoming a salesman of radio equipment			1
with his sales patter and his brief time as a policeman , @entity51 was a convincing pitch man			1
in a training video to potential salesmen in @entity63 , @entity51 can clearly be heard saying he " worked with explosives " during his time with the @entity23 police			2
" he targeted countries where terrorism and violence was rife , " @entity37 said			1
" they had such terrible problems with violence and terrorism , they were desperate for any measure to prevent them from happening			2
the countries that he targeted also did n't have proper testing methods or any scientific laboratories to make sure they worked			2
they very much took the trust of the person selling it			0
and @entity1 came across as an honest and reliable businessman			2
but in fact he was a con man			0
" it was the ' made in the @entity23 ' label on the @entity1 that tipped off @entity23 police			1

police investigators believe it cost him less than $ 60 to make each device			0
in at least one case , he sold them for as much as $ 300,000 a piece			0

an @entity116 general has been jailed for procuring the @entity1 through " unauthorized " channels			2
@entity23 police believe that @entity51 paid off officials to buy the @entity1 in bulk			1

it was a profitable business			0
his company made between $ 60 million and Â £ 80 million			0
