-- less than a week after @entity1 picked up an eye watering $ 11.5 million check as he claimed the @entity4 , the best golfers from the @entity6 and @entity7 will go head to head with not a dime on the line and with nothing to play for but pride itself			1
the 39th @entity14 matches at @entity15 in @entity16 will be watched by packed and partisan galleries and a huge global television audience , but for the 12 players on each team overall victory in the biennial team event is all that matters			1
they are playing for expenses only and whenever the issue of financial rewards is raised , it is quickly ruled out			0
" no prize money is involved , just a lot of pride , " three - time @entity7 captain @entity29 told @entity0			1
" and the matches are very , very competitive			0
" the @entity6 team will have the @entity35 running through their veins and it 's a chance for the @entity7 to combine under a united flag			1
" it 's the only competition we have with the @entity6 outside the occasional football match and it 's the same for them given that their main sports are baseball , gridiron and ice - hockey , " said @entity39 , chair of the @entity40			1
" let 's face it , it 's not hard for @entity6 to show nationalistic pride ! " the @entity53 added with tongue in cheek			1
timely intervention this is a contest which grips golf and sports fans for three days but was in danger of extinction in the 1970s and had it not been for the intervention of 18 - time major winner @entity65 , it may well have withered and died			2
@entity65 proposed to @entity66 , the then president of the @entity68 , that players from continental @entity7 should augment the @entity70 and @entity72 line - up to make for a better contest			1
the @entity6 had only lost once in the post-war era -- in 1957 at @entity75 -- and interest , particularly in @entity6 , was dwindling			1
@entity65 ' suggestion was taken up , so in 1979 two @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , took their place for the match at @entity83 in @entity84			0
this did not prevent the visiting team from suffering a heavy defeat , but as @entity39 , who was reporting his first of 17 @entity88 and counting , recalls , the change was " absolutely essential "			0
@entity90 made one of his eight appearances as a player in that watershed encounter and admitted " @entity79 and @entity95 had disappointing matches			0
" ( they both had 1 - 4 - 0 records			0
) " however , their participation in the long - term saved the @entity14 , " he added			2
two years later , @entity79 sat out proceedings at @entity103 in 1981 after a dispute over his @entity106 membership , but even he would have been able to do little to prevent what is rated the strongest @entity6 team in history thrashing the home side			1
@entity111 that was to be last time that the @entity6 enjoyed such a level of domination and by the time of the next match at @entity117 in @entity118 in 1983 , the @entity7 were united under the captaincy of @entity120 , with @entity79 in his pomp			1
a narrow defeat was followed by a resounding victory at @entity124 in 1985			0
@entity79 famously drove the 311 - yard 10th at the @entity126 club to set the scene			0
@entity128 sunk the winning putt and the champagne flowed as the players celebrated on the clubhouse roof as @entity133 flew past			2
" there was n't a dry eye in the house , " said @entity39			0
when rookie @entity137 and @entity79 led from the front to help @entity7 to their first win on @entity6 soil in the 1987 match at @entity143 , the transformation of the event into a clash like no other was finally complete			1
read : @entity79 and @entity137 : @entity14 revolutionaries @entity137 , who will captain @entity7 in @entity16 this week , says he was addicted to the @entity14 drug from the moment he first sampled the atmosphere			1
" @entity153 was very special to me -- it made me realize how special the event was and i fell in love with it straight away , " he told @entity0			0
top partnership his partnership in four balls and foursomes ( where the players take a alternative shots ) with @entity79 was to bring 11 wins and two tied rubbers in 15 matches over the course of four @entity14 contests			1
despite their domination , it was the @entity6 who made a mini comeback of their own			2
they tied the match at @entity124 in 1989 , then wrested the trophy back in the " @entity181 " at @entity182 in 1991 , where @entity177 agonizingly missed a tricky putt to force another tie			0
the @entity6 also won at @entity124 in 1993 , but a @entity7 team under @entity29 's captaincy took the trophy back at @entity186 in 1995 to spark a run of six victories in the last eight contests			1
it was @entity79 ' last match as a player and he was sadly past his best , losing his last day singles			0
but his tearful embrace with arch rival @entity195 , who had beaten @entity196 in the key match , is symptomatic of the spirit of the @entity14 , where individual performances are secondary to the team effort			1
@entity29 had tasted narrow defeat as a non-playing skipper in 1991 and 1993 so victory in such fashion was sweet			0
" i felt i made a few mistakes in the first two matches , but feel i learned from those mistakes for the 1995 match , " he said			0
the two victories for the @entity6 since 1995 have both been on home soil : the infamous " @entity212 " in 1999 and at @entity213 in 2008			2
raucous galleries @entity137 will doubtless still have the images of 1999 deep in his memory as the @entity6 team poured on to the green after @entity220 's putt gave him victory over the @entity222			1
but @entity137 still had his own putt to halve the 17th , meaning that golf etiquette had been breached			0
he missed the 25 - footer and the cup was heading back across the @entity227			0
the @entity6 win in 2008 in @entity229 was also greeted by raucous galleries but not on the level of 1991 and 1999 , and both captains -- @entity137 and @entity232 -- have spoken of the need for the traditions of the match to be preserved at @entity236			2
based on the world rankings , it is likely to be a close run affair			0
@entity7 has four of the top five in the rankings , led by world @entity242 , but the home team boasts 10 inside the top 20 and have -- in wild card pick @entity1 -- the man of the moment after his triumph in @entity249			1
the lowest ranked player in the match is @entity253 rookie @entity252 at @entity254 , which demonstrates the quality of the offering over three days of competition			0
the first two days are taken up with fourball and foursomes team play , with 12 head to head singles matches rounding off the action sunday			0
@entity242 's likely face off with @entity265 is set to be a final day highlight but nearly every expert is predicting a nip and tuck affair			0
close match " my hope is that it will be a close match and that the result will come down to the final pairing and the final green , " said @entity39			0
" then i hope the @entity6 win because if we keep on winning , then the interest on the @entity35 side of the @entity227 will start to wane			2
" " it really is too close to call , " added @entity29			0
it will all be a far cry from the first @entity14 in @entity280 in 1927 where the @entity70 and @entity72 team traveled by ocean liner to contest a trophy which was the brainchild of @entity285 businessman @entity284			1
they lost rather easily but it was not until 1937 that a @entity6 team captained by @entity289 achieved the first ' away ' win			1
it was the signal for @entity6 domination , with only the 1957 win and the 1969 halved match at @entity294 , where @entity295 and @entity65 played a memorable last day singles , offering @entity298 and @entity72 any consolation			2
@entity65 , forever in touch with the history of his beloved sport , then made his crucial intervention , meaning the contest came alive and since 1979 we have seen eight @entity7 wins , seven for the @entity6 and one tied match			1
@entity307 , who played such a key role in the @entity7 resurgence , both as a player and captain of the winning team on @entity78 soil in 1997 , will be in everyone 's thoughts this week			1
it is the first match since he sadly passed away in may 2011 and @entity137 's men have a special image of him emblazoned on their golf bags as a constant reminder of his special place in the event 's history			2
