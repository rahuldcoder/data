@entity0 -- @entity2 is an 80 - year - old crime victim who had the absolute right to use deadly force to defend himself when a pair of burglars -- a man and a woman -- broke into his home in @entity10 , @entity11 , and began assaulting him			1
and yet , if there is any justice , the 80 - year - old should spend the remainder of his golden years in prison			0
that 's because he killed 28 - year - old @entity18 , who begged for her life , telling @entity2 : " do n't shoot me , i 'm pregnant ! i 'm going to have a baby ! " not true , according to the @entity21			1
but @entity2 did n't know when he pulled the trigger -- for a second time			1
the homeowner , who has been robbed before , told police that he returned home one night and found @entity18 and her accomplice , who has been identified as 26 - year - old @entity27 , trying to open his safe			1
@entity2 said they immediately attacked him and threw him to the ground , breaking his collarbone			2
while the intruders were distracted , @entity2 got up and retrieved his .22 caliber @entity33 revolver			2
when @entity18 and @entity27 saw he was armed , he said they ran out of the house			2
@entity2 told a @entity38 television station that he pursued the intruders outside and into a nearby alley , gun in hand			2
he told knbc : " when the time comes to defend yourself , you best do something			0
" but , at this point , @entity2 was no longer defending himself because he was n't in imminent danger			1
and he was not protecting his home			0
instead , he was stalking his prey			0
then , @entity2 told the television station , he fired on the burglars , hitting @entity18 in the back			1
if @entity2 shot @entity18 in the back , it makes it hard for him to argue that he was n't in control of the situation and that somehow he felt threatened by @entity18			1
finally , @entity2 said with no remorse , as @entity27 ran off , @entity18 pleaded for her life and claimed to be pregnant			1
but @entity2 fired off another shot anyway , killing her			1
since @entity18 was n't really pregnant , we can assume that she was just trying to save her own skin			1
maybe @entity2 believed her , or maybe he did n't			1
what matters is this : with the suspect already wounded and bleeding , @entity2 should have called police and waited for them to arrive			1
he did n't do that			0
instead , he meted out his own punishment			0
was that because @entity2 was angry and frustrated at being victimized and wanted retribution ? if so , that 's not a good excuse for taking a life			2
@entity27 has been found and arrested on suspicion of murder for taking part in a crime that led to @entity18 's death			1
his arraignment is scheduled for august 11			0
given that we 're talking about an 80 - year - old crime victim who grabbed a gun with the intent to defend himself , there are clearly extenuating circumstances			0
but they are not enough to let @entity2 avoid taking some responsibility for killing @entity18			1
he 's a victim , but not a completely innocent one			0
the fact that he was robbed and beaten does n't excuse everything that happened next			0
@entity2 pursued @entity18 out of his house and into the alley			1
he shot her in the back			0
and then , with her lying wounded on the ground and pleading for her life -- and still not clear on whether or not she was really pregnant -- he fired the fatal shot			2
this was n't premeditated , but neither was it a spontaneous crime of passion			0
during this entire ordeal , @entity2 had plenty of time to think about what was happening and how to react			2
he chose to react by shooting down someone who was no longer fleeing and no longer a threat to him			0
by firing the fatal shot at someone who was alone , unarmed , wounded , defenseless and pleading for her life , @entity2 committed a cold - blooded act			1
if you confront a burglar in your home , and you feel your life is in danger , and you grab a gun to defend yourself and kill that person , most reasonable people could consider that to be a justified use of deadly force			0
and it cheapens the right to self - defense to apply that label to what happened here			0
because his crime was n't premeditated , @entity2 should n't be charged with first - degree murder			2
second - degree will suffice			0
and if it is proved in court that he punitively and needlessly took a life , then he should be locked up for the rest of his .			0

police say @entity2 , 80 , shot to death intruder who said , " do n't shoot , i 'm pregnant "
@entity143 : but when he shot her , @entity2 was no longer in imminent danger
@entity2 said he shot @entity18 in the back , then shot her again when she was pleading
@entity143 : she was not pregnant , but @entity2 would not have known that at the time
