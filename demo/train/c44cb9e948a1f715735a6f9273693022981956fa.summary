-- it 's hard out there for a plus - sized - and - proud actress like @entity4 — especially in a world where svelte @entity6 considers herself " obese " by @entity8 standards			1
but @entity4 has built a career even the tiniest starlet should envy — one that 's included an @entity12 ( and another nomination ) , an @entity15 nod , and roles in two $ 100 million - plus - grossing comedies in the past two years			2
even so , @entity4 's weight has made her a target for @entity21 - happy marketing execs , mean - spirited internet commenters ( that 's right , guys — we see you ! ) , and at least one film critic			1
the @entity28 's @entity27 famously attacked @entity4 in his review of " @entity30 " this past february , calling her " tractor - sized , " a " female hippo , " and " a gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success			1
" his comments quickly went viral , prompting online rage but no direct response from the comedian herself — until now			2
the very mention of @entity27 's remarks was enough to strip @entity4 of her normally sunny tone , according to a new profile in the @entity44			1
her first reaction to the review was pure shock : " really ? why would someone o.k. that ? " as somebody raising two daughters during a " strange epidemic of body image and body dysmorphia , " the article felt particularly stinging to her			1
but ultimately , the star of the upcoming comedy " @entity58 " decided that it 's better to take the high road : " i felt really bad for someone who is swimming in so much hate , " @entity4 told the @entity44			1
" i just thought , that 's someone who 's in a really bad spot , and i am in such a happy spot			0
i laugh my head off every day with my husband and my kids who are mooning me and singing me songs			0
" the @entity44 writes that @entity4 seemed to have more to say — until she was rudely interrupted by a blaring fire alarm			2
" i imagine that 's my publicist , " she told her interviewer with a laugh			0
" the gods did n't want us discussing this			0
