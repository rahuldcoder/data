-- in a tiny car repair shop in the @entity3 capital of @entity4 , one can encounter the latest efforts to solve the country 's sky high youth unemployment rate			1
it 's here that 23 - year - old @entity9 can now fix his sights on a career after a year - long apprenticeship program			1
" i learned so many things such as how to monitor a car using an electronic device , also how to fill gas the proper way using this device , " @entity9 said			2
after years of debate on how to lift up the most vulnerable , training programs are targeting the informal economy and small businesses that need qualified workers			1
this is a regional challenge			2
youth unemployment in the @entity26 and @entity27 is running above 27 % , the highest in the world			1
@entity3 's is slightly above that average and the government has allocated ample resources to try and reverse this trend			1
according to the @entity34 , this equates to some 10 % of gdp for the last two decades			2
but the challenge is to close the gap between what happens here in the classroom and what is needed by industry			2
this is where @entity44 of the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) comes into the picture			1
for their auto academy pilot program , the @entity45 brought together trade unions and private sector companies to see what is needed in the labor market			1
" thinking like this can make a step forward in order to address youth unemployment but it needs involvement of all partners in this process , " @entity44 said			1
and the early results are promising			2
trainer and mentor , @entity63 , said he 's taught nearly 200 students with a placement rate of 89 %			2
" there is a drastic change in the students , " @entity63 said			0
" they come to us with no skills ; they are either drop outs or only have high school degrees , they are 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 - year - olds			0
" @entity76 endeavor it 's not just in the inner cities that are the focus of the training programs			1
in the rural @entity83 area of @entity84 two hours drive from @entity4 , there is ground breaking work taking place inside a local community center			0
up to 50 women , many who have not held jobs before , are being trained to work in a textile factory that is being built nearby			0
" there is strong demand because it 's a ladies environment and everything is available for us , " said @entity92 , a worker in the factory			0
" the most important is transportation that is guaranteed			0
" her colleague @entity99 agrees			0
" it has helped me to meet new people			0
i now know how to communicate with my manager and my colleagues			0
" according to the local tribal leader , @entity105 , such progress has only been made possible by having a dialogue with parents to get support for women to enter the workforce -- which represents a cultural breakthrough in itself			1
" we want more courses and more attention to it and focus on more production companies within this area , " @entity105 said			0
call it a small success story for a big problem plaguing the region .			0
