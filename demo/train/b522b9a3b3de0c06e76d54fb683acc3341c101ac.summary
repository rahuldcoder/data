@entity1 drones are fighting the war on terror , smuggling drugs on the border and crashing near the @entity7			1
it is ironic that a drone could strike down near the @entity7 -- as one did monday morning -- since the issue of drone strikes is one that will follow president @entity15 and mark his legacy			1
after the crash near his temporary home , @entity15 called during an interview with @entity2 's @entity20 for more drone regulation			2
" the drone that landed in the @entity7 you buy in @entity24 , " @entity15 said			1
but when historians talk in the future about drones and the @entity15 @entity7 , they wo n't be referring to be the two - foot long quad copter that was discovered on the @entity31 corner of the @entity7 grounds and sent @entity1 into a security - related lather early monday morning , but rather to the unmanned aerial vehicles -- the @entity35 calls them @entity37 -- like the one that was confirmed on monday by the @entity41 government to have delivered its payload in @entity43			1
the strike acknowledged monday is one of more than 500 that have been launched by the @entity41 since 2011 , according to data compiled by @entity48			2
three officials told @entity2 's @entity50 about the drone strike in @entity52 , @entity43 , which was conducted by the @entity53			1
the agency declined to comment , although @entity50 reported that it is not believed any major @entity56 leaders were targeted			2
this is the first @entity41 drone strike of the year in @entity43 and the first since a popular uprising in @entity43 has destabilized the government that has so far cooperated with the @entity41 in its anti-terror campaign			1
the @entity48 has sought to keep a tally of @entity41 - led drone strikes in @entity63 and @entity43			1
the use of drones peaked in @entity63 in 2010 and in @entity43 in 2012 , according to their data			2
it was in 2010 that the @entity70 lawyers wrote a secret memo for the @entity15 administration that argued extra-judcial killings of people suspected of being terrorists was justified under @entity76 , even in the case of @entity41 citizens thought to be plotting abroad			0
that memo -- or two thirds of it that were not redacted -- were released by a federal court last june in the face of a lawsuit by the @entity84			0
clearly there 's a huge difference between the type of drone used by the military to target and kill suspected terrorists and the type of drone used to take video with a @entity94			1
somewhere in between is the type of drone , also in the news , drug smugglers are now using to carrying drugs across the @entity100 border			1
@entity102 police said last week they intercpted a drone carrying six pounds of synthetic drug crystal meth that crashed into a super market parking lot because six pounds , worth about $ 48,000 according to the @entity106 , was too much weight for the drone to handle			1
a spokesman for @entity110 and @entity111 said @entity41 authorities have not yet encountered a drone as part of the war on drugs			2
but they do use drones of their own to monitor traffic on the @entity100 border for undocumented crossings			0
in addition to drug smugglers , legitimate businesses want to use drones too			0
@entity128 wants @entity129 to use them , although it 's a little unclear how that 'll work out			0
related : @entity129 's drone delivery : how would it work ? @entity134 , who is ceo for @entity135 , testified about research into the commercial use of drones jan. 21 on @entity139			0
he did so with a small drone , about the same size as the one that crashed near the @entity7 , hovering next to him			1
there were snickers when the drone briefly crashed in the hearing room			2
all of this is in the way of saying drones are taking on an increased importance in the @entity41 economy and becoming more visible in the nation 's airways			0
the @entity155 has issued some guidelines restricting where and how users can fly drones , but the industry is largely unregulated as more companies look to buy and integrate the relatively new technology into their business			0
the @entity155 had set a september 2015 deadline to roll out a list of drone regulations			0
@entity15 noted the need for more regulation during his interview with @entity2 's @entity20			0
" you know that there are companies like @entity129 that are talking about using small drones to deliver packages ... there are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play in terms of farmers who are managing crops and conservationists who want to take stock of wildlife			0
" but we do n't really have any kind of regulatory structure at all for it			0
