@entity0 -- when the @entity3 decided to create a bicameral legislative branch , they were trying to make things difficult for the federal government to grab power from the people			1
what the @entity3 may not have foreseen was how much the @entity10 and the @entity11 would grow to dislike and distrust each other			1
why is this important now ? democrats in the @entity10 may have to take the political risk of voting to pass the health care bill based on assurances from the @entity11 that the upper chamber will eventually modify the law to change some things @entity10 @entity14 do n't want			1
i live a bipartisan household			0
i am a creature of the @entity10 , having spent 15 years toiling as a @entity25 staffer in the lower chamber			1
my wife is a @entity11 girl , having spent about the same amount of time as a @entity25 staffer in the upper chamber			1
talk about @entity32 and @entity33			0
when you are working for the @entity10 majority , you worry less about the tactics of the minority and more about the workings of an inscrutable @entity11			1
former speaker @entity39 reportedly once said to a @entity41 colleague : " remember , the @entity10 @entity25 are merely the opposition			1
the @entity11 is the enemy			1
" two examples come quickly to mind			0
right after @entity47 became majority leader in the @entity11 in 2003 , president @entity46 and @entity10 @entity25 were pushing for a tax cut of a certain size , which they thought would stimulate an economy that was faltering			1
to do so , both the @entity10 and @entity11 needed to pass a budget resolution that included that sizeable tax cut number			1
the @entity10 passed the budget , and all eyes were on the @entity11 majority leader , who was having some trouble convincing a few wayward senators to climb on board the tax cut train			1
suddenly , a deal was struck , and the @entity11 passed the budget			2
but nobody in the @entity10 knew exactly what the deal was			2
rumors started floating around that @entity47 had promised the few moderates who did n't like the high cost of the tax cut to only allow a tax cut of half the size being pushed by the president and by @entity72 to pass the @entity11			2
the @entity72 were , to put it politely , outraged			0
they accused the new majority leader and the new budget chairman ( @entity76 ) of treachery , of cowardice , and worse , of being squishes			0
and they spent the next six months trying to come up with a plan to screw the dastardly @entity11			2
in october 2001 , just after the september 11 terrorist attacks , a jittery congressional leadership went to the @entity10 to meet with the president			2
at the early morning meeting , sen. @entity85 divulged that his office had received a powdery substance that looked just like the anthrax that had been sent to news broadcasters in @entity91			0
if it was the same anthrax , it could be deadly , especially if it got into the @entity94 air ducts			0
all four leaders agreed to close down the @entity94 to protect the lives of the employees who worked there			0
speaker @entity99 and minority leader @entity100 dutifully told their @entity10 colleagues of the plan , and they shut down their side of the @entity94			2
when @entity85 and sen. @entity105 went back to brief their colleagues about the plan , there was a rebellion			0
@entity111 @entity110 was especially obstinate , saying basically that closing the @entity94 was the same as surrendering to terrorists			0
without telling @entity99 and @entity100 , the @entity11 announced that it was staying open			2
the headline in the @entity115 the next morning blared " @entity122 , " calling the speaker and the @entity10 a bunch of cowards for trying to protect their staff from an anthrax attack			2
i never had so much fun in my life working with my @entity10 @entity41 counterparts launching a furious counterattack in the media against the upper chamber			2
my former boss , speaker @entity99 , who had nothing but disdain for the @entity11 , used to call senators those " prancing ponies who all wanted to be president			1
" and the @entity11 , from what my wife tells me , holds the @entity10 in similarly minimal high regard			1
the question that now roils the @entity10 is : can they trust the @entity11 ? could they trust them when the @entity10 , during president @entity146 's first term , passed a politically very dangerous btu tax , a new tax based on energy consumption ? dozens of vulnerable @entity14 voted for the president 's budget that included that tax , only to see it stripped by the @entity11			1
the answer , sadly , is no. the @entity11 is going to do what it is going to do			2
it is going to get as much done as it can get done , with the limitations it has under its rules			0
and if it sees a chance to stick it to the @entity10 , believe me , it will			0
the difference between the @entity10 and the @entity11 is this : @entity160 who have power and positions of authority have already put in the time and energy to be @entity10 people			1
@entity167 and @entity168 have no interest in moving up to the @entity11			0
they are going to fight for the prerogatives of their colleagues and of their institution			0
most senators still believe , in the back of the their minds , they will be or should be president			0
they are always looking for ways to play to the cameras and increase their national prominence			0
aside from the egos and the ambition of those in the upper body , there are also the rules			0
the @entity11 rules give more power to individual senators and more power to the minority			1
that tradition has been around for a long time , so that the @entity11 does n't just become a smaller version of the @entity10			1
it was created to give states , especially in less populous regions , an ability to protect themselves from the demands of the more populous regions of the country			0
it is on big bills , like the health care reform legislation now being considered by the @entity10 and the @entity11 , where the stresses between the @entity10 and the @entity11 become more pronounced			1
@entity10 members are now asking themselves : can we trust the @entity11 ? if we pass their bill , will they pass ours ? if we go out on a limb for them , will they change their @entity11 rules for us ? well , as president @entity215 used to say about the old @entity216 : trust			1
which really means do n't trust them at all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			0

health bill passage may require @entity10 @entity14 to trust @entity14
@entity10 could make politically difficult vote on theory that @entity11 would modify law later
@entity222 says there 's a long *history* of mistrust between the two chambers
he says senators have lofty ambitions and more prerogatives
