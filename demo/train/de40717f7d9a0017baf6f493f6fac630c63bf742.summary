@entity19 , the former cricket star who now leads one of @entity1 's largest political parties , has demanded the resignation of @entity11 and new elections amid allegations of vote - rigging during last year 's voting			2

after failing to negotiate a solution with the protest movements , @entity11 on thursday asked the country 's powerful military for help brokering an end to the crisis			1

anger over shooting the @entity29 - led protests have been fueled by anger over the fatal shooting of at least 10 of his supporters by police in the city of @entity80 in june			2
@entity29 has alleged that @entity81 , the chief minister of @entity83 province and the brother of the prime minister , was ultimately responsible for the shooting			1
