@entity0 , @entity1 -- a small army of elite , highly trained clones are sent on a mission to root out drugs and ammunition from the city			1
every few hours they report back to their masters , to whom they 've been devoted since birth			0
but this is n't the set of a low - budget sci - fi flick ; it 's the departure lounge of @entity1 's @entity20 , where seven " super clone " sniffer - dogs have been dispatched in the war against contraband luggage			1
the pack of golden @entity28 are all genetically identical to " @entity29 , " whose legendary snout kept him top of @entity0 's drug - detection rankings right up until his retirement in 2007			1
but now after years of training , the new class is following in their genetic donor 's paw - prints , consistently outperforming the rest of @entity1 's naturally born sniffers in the hunt for heroin , cocaine and methamphetamines			0
interactive : @entity44 they are the work of professor @entity47 , who established his reputation in 2005 as the driving force behind @entity50 ( an amalgam of @entity53 puppy ) , the world 's first ever dog clone			1
" the officers in @entity57 read our dog - cloning article and they suggested the project to us , " recalls @entity47			2
indeed , @entity1 customs had a problem on their hands			0
only three out of every 10 selectively bred sniffer dogs that it trained --- at a cost of about $ 40,140 each -- had the nostrils and the discipline for the job			1
although the seven @entity28 clones cost upwards of $ 100,000 each , every single one of them made the grade			1
but @entity47 refuses to take all the credit : " i think half of the ability comes from the genetic background and half comes from the training , " he said			0
lending weight , if it were needed , to the claim that aptitude is indeed a balance of nature and nurture , the dogs still display variations in performance despite their identical genes			2
and leader of the pack is @entity91			0
" last year , he won a medal for detecting the most drugs at the @entity20 ( @entity0 ) airport , " boasts his long - time handler @entity92			1
like his septuplet brothers , @entity91 began training for the job at the age one and now , as a mature four year - old , works five to six hourly shifts a day			0
" he 's very active and energetic ... he 's kind of tough ... and he only likes me which makes me feel good , " beams @entity92			2
but it 's not just drug - mules and meth - addicts that need fear the arrival of this sniffing super-breed			0
@entity47 's next clone will be a high - performance " quarantine dog " -- gifted with an enhanced capacity for detecting the presence of disease in humans			2
@entity47 says that , due to the high number of travelers passing through @entity0 , the airport has experienced problems with the spread of infectious diseases , " so the @entity1 government have asked us to clone some quarantine sniffing dogs " beyond the airport barriers , professor @entity47 spends his time cloning a variety of other canine breeds , each with a specific purpose in mind			1
" some clients want to replicate their own pets " says @entity47			2
in other cases , the scientist works in conservation , creating identical copies of endangered animals			0
" wolves are endangered species in @entity1 , especially grey wolves			1
we collected cells from the ear of wolves ... and transported to surrogate dogs and finally we produced cloned wolves " says @entity47			1
so , now that he 's cloned man 's best friend , are there any plans for man himself ? " scientifically all the animals , including humans , can be cloned , but i have never thought about ( it )			0
it 's illegal and it 's an ethical problem			0

a breed of ' super clone ' sniffer dogs is in action at @entity20
