-- @entity2 ceo @entity1 headed to @entity3 tuesday to give testimony about @entity2 's alleged mishandling of defective ignition switches in its cars			1
it 's an awkward moment			0
after all , the automaker is having to explain its questionable behavior to the same benefactor -- the @entity13 government -- that financially supported the company when it needed the protection of bankruptcy laws in 2009			1
despite tougher laws enacted in 2000 and 2010 to encourage automakers and the @entity20 to aggressively root out safety concerns , it is believed that it took @entity2 more than 10 years to publicly acknowledge that it had a potentially fatal problem			1
@entity1 testified , among other things , about @entity2 's recall of 1.6 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches that may have led to deaths of 13 people			1
facing impending litigation , it is proffering an interesting defense , essentially saying : " that was the @entity34 we are the new gm. therefore , we 're not responsible			0
" as you can imagine , whether in the courtroom , the workplace or home , a defense like this would not get you too far			0
it 's not likely it would even fly in kindergarten			0
whether it 's gun charges or throwing @entity46 at others , avoiding responsibility because the bad behavior occurred at a point in time prior to the present has never been a viable excuse			2
yet , for some of the largest corporations , this defense not only thrives , it 's government - approved			0
like the mythical phoenix , @entity2 's bankruptcy filing in 2009 -- and the subsequent restructuring agreement -- allowed the company to rise again from its ashes			1
after @entity2 filed for bankruptcy , the @entity13 government rescued it with a restructuring agreement that , in part , protected the company from legal claims arising prior to bankruptcy			1
in fairness , the idea of avoiding past liability is not a novel concept in the esoteric world of bankruptcy			2
in fact , the public policy behind it makes sense			1
@entity79 is a process where people and businesses can eliminate or repay some or all of their debts , under the watchful eye of an intervening federal bankruptcy court			2
to help them " start over , " companies or persons may obtain a discharge , or forgiveness , of debt in the process			0
the debtor is released from liability for the debt			0
under the approved asset sale agreement in @entity2 's bankruptcy , what was called " @entity2 " agreed to assume liability for products liability claims arising from accidents involving @entity2 vehicles , but only where the accident occurred after july 10 , 2009 , regardless of when the product was purchased			1
" @entity34 " retained liability for other products liability claims , and " @entity2 " assumed no liability for injuries prior to july 10 , 2009			1
new @entity2 kept the productive assets , with none of the irritating encumbrances of @entity34 plaintiffs with pending claims prior to the magic date , and any injuries that arose prior to july 10 , 2009 , are stuck going after @entity34 in the bankruptcy court proceeding			1
the same @entity34 that went bankrupt			0
because of the 2009 cutoff , the lawyers will have to use creative tactics to hold @entity2 liable			1
for example , if @entity2 continued with an ongoing fraud after 2009 to conceal defects , or if it knowingly deceived the bankruptcy judge about its wrongdoing , that could potentially neutralize @entity2 's supposed immunity			1
if this is troubling , blame the bankruptcy court and the others who agreed to this cutoff			2
you can blame @entity2 , too , but it was just acting as any company does , whether new or old : it exists to maximize profit			1
any company 's management is legally obligated to do just that			0
@entity79 recognizes that there will be losers in the process , and those losers are creditors of the company			0
after all , if a bankrupt company could continue to be hammered by creditors ad infinitum , it would never climb out of debt			0
bankruptcy gives many people and businesses a chance to survive , where they would otherwise be ground into dust by creditors , leaving everyone on the losing end			2
but even though we may justify the economics , the defense itself is anathema to virtually every lesson our society teaches about responsibility and punishment			1
imagine if you could declare criminal " bankruptcy , " and refuse to be incarcerated for any crime occurring before the most recent @entity164			2
consider your response if your teenager came home and announced he was declining responsibility for any broken windows or bad grades prior to tuesday			2
as a cultural consideration , this abdication of responsibility just feels a little strange when applied to , well , virtually every other aspect of life			0
nonetheless , readers are encouraged to try the new defense out the next time the boss calls you into the office for a bad review or you get locked up for drug possession , whichever occurs first			0
try this excuse out , and report back			0
just remind your persecutor : " that was then , this is now			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

@entity189 : @entity2 under fire ; faulty ignition switches may have led to fatalities
he says 2009 bankruptcy in part protects @entity2 from claims made before then -- sorry plaintiffs
he says *post-bankruptcy* @entity2 can keep assets and avoid liabilities
@entity189 : bankruptcy makes economic sense but *counter* to responsibility in society
