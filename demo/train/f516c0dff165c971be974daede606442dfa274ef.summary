@entity0 -- the dangerous roads of @entity3 and @entity4 have forced changes in what soldiers drive , and forced costs up as well , according to a just - released report on @entity11 vehicles			2
the former military workhorse , the humvee , carried a $ 70,000 price tag			2
as that was modified , or " up - armored , " the cost rose to from $ 160,000 to $ 220,000			1
" this modern @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , however , still does not fully meet the evolving mobility or protection requirements of our soldiers , " according to the report , released by the @entity11 thursday			2
it looks ahead to future needs for tactical wheeled vehicles			0
the next generation , @entity28 , the @entity28 , has new capabilities and a higher price but is still far cheaper than , mraps , @entity32 , developed to counter hidden explosive devices , the report notes			1
" the cost to provide this capability is high -- it is estimated that each @entity28 will cost in excess of $ 300,000 before equipping with essential combat systems -- but not as high as the cost of the @entity34 family of vehicles , which cost $ 430,000 - $ 900,000 apiece to procure , " the report says			1
the @entity11 estimates that its wheeled vehicles right now cost $ 70 billion			1
" to meet the threat on today 's battlefields , trucks must now be armored , have the additional capacity and power to carry that armor , and be outfitted with a wide variety of command , control , communications and computers , and intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance equipment , " the report says			0
but the report also recognizes that budgets may be contracting			0
" the @entity11 is also on the downward side of a phase of increased funding to support fleet growth and modernization , " the report says			0
" as a result , the @entity11 of the next 15 years must adapt its @entity69 fleet to meet the threats of today and tomorrow , with reduced funding as compared to the past seven years			0

" @entity17 " humvees cost up to $ 220,000 each , up from an *original* $ 70,000 , the report says
