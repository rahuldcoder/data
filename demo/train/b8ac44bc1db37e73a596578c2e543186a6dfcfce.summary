-- of all the great films @entity1 made over his long career , one stands alone : " @entity4			1
" the 1967 film by @entity6 , who died wednesday , was pioneering in many ways			1
it captured the youthful zeitgeist through the eyes of @entity11 's @entity4 , a recent college graduate who 's " a little worried about his future , " as the tagline went			1
it featured existing pop songs as part of the score , now commonplace but then unusual			1
and it had , at the time , a willfully experimental look , with jump cuts , long takes and odd camera angles			1
it changed @entity25 , said @entity26 , author of " @entity27			1
" " by the time ' @entity4 ' was at the end of its run , it was the third highest - grossing movie in history , " he told @entity0 in 2008			1
" those are the kinds of numbers that make even hidebound executives say , ' we 're in a new world			1
' " thanks to the script by @entity40 and @entity41 , " @entity4 " also had some of the most quotable lines and indelible scenes in movie history			1
here are five standouts : " plastics			2
" a squirmy @entity48 makes his way through a welcome - home party , wanting more than anything to avoid everybody glad - handing him			2
unfortunately , he comes into contact with mr. @entity54 , who has one word for @entity56 , " just one word			2
" the line captured everything ' 60s youth disdained : a corporate job and artificiality			1
it was named no. 42 on the @entity65 's list of the 100 greatest movie quotations			1
" mrs. @entity68 , you 're trying to seduce me			2
are n't you ? " @entity11 and @entity72 , as family friend @entity70 , awkwardly chat in the @entity74 ' lounge			2
as mrs. @entity68 makes advances -- " what do you think of me ? " she asks -- @entity48 becomes more and more uncomfortable			2
" mrs. @entity68 , if you do n't mind my saying so , this conversation is getting a little strange , " he says			0
and that 's just the beginning			0
kissing mrs. @entity68 as @entity56 and mrs. @entity68 begin their affair , the young @entity56 tries to impress the older woman			0
but his attempts at being suave go nowhere and he starts to lose his nerve			0
the portion of the scene in which @entity11 cups @entity89 's breast -- and then bangs his head against the wall -- was improvised , @entity11 observed			0
he was trying to hide his laughter and @entity6 kept the camera rolling			0
" @entity95 " the @entity97 soundtrack was originally just a placeholder			0
@entity6 and editor @entity99 used their songs , including " @entity95 , " " @entity102 " and " april come she will , " to help structure the film			0
but @entity6 liked the way they worked and decided to keep them ( along with a score by @entity109 )			0
" @entity95 " is used three times in the film , probably most strikingly in this scene , where @entity56 wastes his days adrift in a swimming pool and his nights meeting with mrs. @entity68			0
" elaine ! " the movie 's finale finds @entity56 heading to a church to stop the marriage of @entity68 , mrs. @entity68 's daughter , and her fiance			1
delayed at every turn -- uncertain of directions , running out of gas , locked out of the church -- @entity56 finally lets cry a pained scream at his beloved			0
but , as the final shot reveals , even love ca n't defeat uncertainty .			0

" @entity4 , " from 1967 , is one of @entity1 ' greatest films
movie captured zeitgeist , was a huge *box* office hit
many scenes , lines of *dialogue* have become famous
