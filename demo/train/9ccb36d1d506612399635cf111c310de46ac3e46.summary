a crude effort at connecting friends and " friends of friends			2
" were these the awkward first steps toward a multibillion - dollar social media empire ? some online sleuths think so , saying that a newly unearthed @entity10 from 1999 appears to be the first website ever created by @entity13 founder @entity12			1
" hi , my name is ... @entity2 , " the site 's creator wrote on its " about me " page , referencing an @entity2 song released that same year			1
" no , really , my name is @entity2			0
just kidding , my name is @entity12			2
" @entity12 describes himself as 15 years old , having just completed his freshman year of high school in " a small town near the massive city of @entity24			1
" all those details match up with @entity13 's billionaire ceo , as does the source code on the site 's main page that lists " @entity12 " as its creator			1
the quaintly outdated and charmingly awkward site ( witness the creepy animated eye on its home page ) showed up wednesday in a post on @entity35 , the news - sharing site associated with startup incubator @entity38			1
immediately , would - be profilers went to work looking for glimpses of a future web titan in the posts of a teen who liked quesadillas , lasers and making fun of his buddies			0
many pointed to the web , an app with the name " @entity12 " in a red box at the center			2
the creator asks friends to add themselves , then two of their own friends			0
those friends can then add two friends of their own , in theory creating an ever - growing network of friends and acquaintances			0
sound familiar ? then , there 's the @entity67			0
it 's a tool to fade text in @entity71 chat , text and e-mails			1
" this is a fader that i made when i was a little bored and somewhat inspired on a long weekend in between finals , " the creator writes			2
" ... so take advantage of this fader and tell your friends to download it as well ! " so , is it really @entity12 ? there are some pretty convincing signs that it might be			2
our favorite comes at the very bottom of the " @entity67 " page			0
the second update of the tool got a new name : " @entity93			0
" the folks at @entity95 , a tech and science site launched by @entity98 , tracked the e-mail address listed on the site -- @entity101 -- back to an account holder with the same screen name that dr. @entity104 , @entity12 's father , uses frequently			1
the source code on the site 's main page suggests that it was , in fact , created in 1999			1
it 's hosted on @entity111 's " ny " subdomain for sites in @entity113 , where @entity12 grew up in suburban @entity114			1
" it could also be some strange , quasi-elaborate hoax meant to embarass @entity93 with @entity2 references and a silly game called ' @entity120 , ' " @entity115 wrote for @entity95			0
" but there 's a lot of compelling evidence that this thing is legit			0
" @entity13 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story .			0

a newly discovered @entity111 website from 1999 appears to be by @entity12
