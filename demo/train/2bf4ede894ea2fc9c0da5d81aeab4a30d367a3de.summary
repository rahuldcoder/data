-- seven months of marathon training have made my 30 - year - old knees feel like those of a person decades older			2
at times , i 've hobbled down stairs and winced unexpectedly			2
if i owned a cane , i 'd shake it at the trim women who run past me while pushing strollers full of infants -- and the gazelle - ish teens who spring by at two to three times my running pace			1
griping about irritating run - spiration t - shirts that say things such as " @entity17 " is a coping mechanism -- a way to distract myself from the somewhat - frightening marathon i signed up to run , like many of you , in response to the @entity24			1
until monday , i wondered if i could finish			1
that was the day i had a conversation with a @entity28 bombing victim who , after three surgeries , ran her first marathon a few weeks ago			1
before that , i worried about " mile 20 , " which is when many runners quit			2
in most marathon training programs , you do n't run farther than 20 miles before race day			1
it seems natural to a @entity39 brain that @entity40 should induce panic			2
how are you supposed to get energy for those extra 6.2 miles , which will take me at least an hour to run ? @entity43 : ' run for @entity28 ' @entity45 group all of those complaints and fears seemed so childish after i e-mailed with @entity48 , a 32 - year - old who was standing near the finish line in @entity28 in april when the bombs went off			1
chips of wood and shrapnel the size of a half - dollar lodged themselves in her leg			2
her fibula broke through the skin			2
the doctors thought she was crazy , she said , when she told them she was going to run the @entity63			1
before the bombing , she signed up for the race in honor of her dad , who died of cancer in october 2012			1
injuries were n't about to change her mind			2
" i 'm not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me , " she told the @entity71			2
three months after the bombing , @entity48 walked without crutches			1
in september , she ran for the first time since the surgeries , which removed the shrapnel , repaired the bone and grafted skin across the bottom part of her leg , pulling the flesh from her thigh			1
@entity48 is a physical therapist in @entity28 , so she knew what she was up against			1
" i know i was n't ready to run , and i said many times that this was the dumbest idea i had ever had , " she wrote to me , " but no one argued with me			0
" related : i 'm running a marathon for @entity28 a friend suggested she walk most of the marathon , but @entity48 insisted she would run it within the 6 1/2 hour limit			1
" i said , ' no. ' that 's not even an option			0
it 's not an option not to finish			1
' " " my dad fought his cancer for six weeks , " she added , " and i could suck it up and do whatever it took for 6 or 6 1/2 hours of ' pain			0
' he was a fighter , and i knew that it was in me in some form			0
" the world of running was new to me when i began this process			1
this spring , two miles stole my breath			0
i had to do a training program to be able to start the marathon training program			0
for all their quirks -- the @entity118 packets , the @entity120 - aided nipples , the overendorphined @entity121 feeds -- runners all seem to harness a sense of determination you do n't find in day - to - day cubicle life			0
it ca n't be a question of whether or not you 'll finish			1
to believe otherwise is to fail , in a sense			0
i believe that now , but only because i 've heard so many stories like @entity48 's			1
earlier this year , i traveled to @entity133 to watch @entity134 finish the marathon she started in @entity28 but was cut less than a mile short by the bombing			1
" once i hit the point where i stopped in @entity28 , i was like , ' no more walking			0
i 'm running this , ' " she told me			1
" this race , this is for @entity28			1
" there , i also met @entity144 , whose wife , @entity146 , was killed in the 1995 @entity133 bombing			2
he ran his first marathon in her honor			0
" she always wanted to run a marathon , and i finally lost enough weight where i thought i could try , " he told me			0
he struggled , but he finished			0
related : in @entity154 , a run to finish what she started when i 'm running the marathon next week in @entity159 , i 'm sure there will be points when i 'll want to give up -- but i wo n't			1
i 'll have too many stories with me			0
i 'll think of how @entity48 's husband washed her damaged leg while she held a towel over her face and cried , unable to walk and not wanting to look at the limb			1
about how she only had run about 11 1/2 miles in her premarathon training			0
she hit " the wall , " so to speak , at mile 22 of her race			2
" it was like a wall or a curtain came down , " she said			0
she does n't remember seeing mile markers 23 or 24			0
" my legs started to cramp , but i did n't want to stop and stretch because i was scared i would n't be able to get going again			0
" she did keep going , of course			0
" my advice would be just take it one step at a time , " she wrote			0
" we are only a select group of people that make that journey and take the time to achieve such an insane goal			0
" take each mile and savor it			0
" " i am glad that i can inspire people , " she added , " but i just feel like a normal person who loves running and who is wicked stubborn ! ... i was gon na cross that finish line one way or another			1
" after hearing @entity48 's story , i 'm sure i will , too			1
i 'd also encourage you to consider signing up for a race -- of any length -- as part of @entity45 's @entity201 group			2
hundreds already have pledged to do so			0
the goal is to show support for the truly brave people such as @entity48 and others who are taking steps each day toward recovering from the @entity28 tragedy			1
we 're running for them			2
