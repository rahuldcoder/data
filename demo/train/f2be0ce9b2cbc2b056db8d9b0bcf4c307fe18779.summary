the first official nuclear negotiations since @entity1 came to power in @entity3 have concluded in @entity4			0
and while the negotiations between @entity3 and the @entity7 will continue in november , this week 's meetings have raised several crucial questions			0
can these talks be characterized as positive diplomatic and political moves for all sides , including @entity3 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , the @entity16 and @entity17 ? and how can we characterize and analyze the @entity3 presentation , titled " closing an unnecessary crisis : opening new horizons " , which aimed at proposing ways to address international concerns on @entity3 programs in return for sanctions relief and international recognition of @entity3 's right to enrich uranium ? firstly , these two - day talks should be contextualized within the larger context of past and future negotiations between @entity3 , the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , and the @entity7			1
these talks and first round of negotiations ought not be analyzed and viewed as the sole indicators of success or failure in the discussions on @entity3 's nuclear enrichment and program			2
without doubt , several indications from these first formal talks project a constructive image of the negotiations			0
@entity48 , spokesman for @entity49 , the @entity50 's top foreign policy official and the lead negotiator in the talks , said that the @entity3 proposal had been " very useful ... for the first time , very detailed technical discussions continued this afternoon			2
" other recent diplomatic progress can be seen at the bilateral meetings between the @entity16 and @entity3 delegations -- meetings that can be regarded as an extension of a potential @entity16 - @entity3 rapprochement , @entity1 's charm offensive , and the exchange of letters and pleasantries between @entity1 and @entity66			2
despite being in the early stages , the talks seem to have been more of a success for @entity3 than the @entity16 and its @entity71 allies			1
speaking in @entity72 and using @entity73 to outline his proposal , the @entity16 - educated foreign minister , @entity76 , created the first ( and necessary ) positive impression that would set the stage for future nuclear talks and the possible easing of sanctions that are crippling @entity3 's economy			1
the @entity3 lauded " serious " talks that had been conducted in a " highly positive atmosphere			0
" @entity3 has now made it much more difficult for the @entity71 powers to make an effective case for further sanctions on @entity3			1
the critical issue , however , is whether @entity3 authorities as well as representatives of @entity7 have achieved their major political and diplomatic objectives with regards to @entity95 's nuclear program			0
the significant complexities and nuances of the objectives of @entity3 , the @entity33 , and @entity7 have not yet been made clear based on these two - day talks in @entity4			0
@entity95 's fundamental aim is to ease the economic sanctions and put an end to the country 's prolonged economic isolation through a softening of its tone and making efforts to reach a resolution			0
the @entity111 's major objective is to move from cautious optimism to confidence , with the ability to assert that @entity3 is not pursuing its nuclear program for weaponry but rather for peaceful purposes with full transparency			1
it remains to be seen whether @entity3 and the @entity7 can achieve their goals in these talks , particularly at a time when the underlying political gap between the @entity3 and @entity71 stance on @entity95 's nuclear enrichment seems to be too deep to bridge			1
in these talks , @entity3 has clearly stated that it possess the right to continue enriching uranium according to the @entity130 , with @entity71 leaders pointing out that @entity3 ought to slow down or suspend its activities until a resolution is reached			2
the next round of negotiations will undoubtedly shed more light on the nuances and underlying complexities of the situation			0
only then will we find out whether these talks marked a new chapter in @entity3 's relationship with the @entity111 , or merely a disappointing continuation of the last one .			1

the talks seem to have been more of a success for @entity3 than the @entity16 , writes @entity148
@entity3 has made it much more difficult for @entity71 powers to make a case for further sanctions , he says
@entity148 : the @entity111 's major objective is to move from cautious optimism to confidence
