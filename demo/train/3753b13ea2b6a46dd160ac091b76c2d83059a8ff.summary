-- it was a glass half - full , glass half - empty kind of weekend at the box office for " funny people , " writer - director @entity7 's comedic meditation on fame , humor , life , and death			1
@entity13 and @entity14 star in " @entity15 , " which took the no. 1 slot at the box office this weekend			1
according to figures from @entity19 , it opened at the top spot with an estimated $ 23.4 million , better than @entity7 's the 40 year - @entity21 ( $ 21.4 million ) -- hence , the glass is half full			1
but that figure is far lower than the debut for @entity7 's " @entity25 " ( $ 30.7 million ) , and it 's the worst opening for a comedy for star @entity27 since his 2000 turkey " @entity30 " -- hence , the glass is half empty			2
of course , " @entity15 " was billed more as a thoughtful dramedy than a balls - out @entity13 laugh-fest , and when matched against the opening frames for @entity13 's serious efforts " @entity36 , " " spanglish , " and " @entity37 , " @entity15 is far and away the winner -- and the glass is half full again			0
but whether it 's a comedy , drama , or dramedy , " @entity15 's " $ 75 million budget is quite the handful of pretty pennies , and with a shaky " @entity48 , the film is going to have a hard time overcoming tepid word - of - mouth -- and we 're back to the half - empty glass			2
so let 's just move on , shall we ? the cup of a certain adolescent wizard , meanwhile , definitely runneth over			0
thanks to its debut on @entity59 ( and the premium ticket prices that come with it ) , " @entity64 and the @entity65 " came in second with $ 17.7 million , a soft 40 percent drop from last weekend for $ 255.5 million total			1
at this rate , the film is well on its way to the upper ranks of the ' @entity64 ' franchise			0
the guinea pigs of " @entity72 " were right on its heels at third place , nibbling up $ 17.1 million , a decent 46 percent drop for a two - week cume of $ 66.5 million			1
and @entity79 's romcom " @entity78 " took in an additional $ 13 million , a 53 percent drop for fourth place and $ 54.5 million total			2
of the two other wide releases this weekend , at least the sci - fi family comedy " @entity85 " -- which grossed a meager $ 7.8 million for fifth place -- broke into the top 10			1
the torture porn flick " @entity89 " collected a grisly $ 3.6 million and plopped dead at 11th place			0
box office on a whole was down a massive 22 percent from last year , when the " @entity93 " and " the mummy : @entity95 " both took in over $ 40 million , but the specialty market showed some vibrant signs of life			1
bone fide indie hit " ( 500 ) @entity101 " expanded to 266 theaters for $ 2.7 million , a $ 10,338 per theater average			0
and three widely disparate films opened in four theaters each to healthy per theater averages : the quirky romantic comedy " @entity27 " ( $ 16,566 per theater ) , the stylish vampire film " @entity109 " ( $ 13,793 per theater ) , and the eco-thriller - cum - documentary " @entity112 " ( $ 13,600 per theater )			0
finally , a true milestone was reached this weekend by " @entity116			0
" with $ 5.1 million this weekend for a running total of $ 255.8 million , the summer 's biggest die hard blockbuster has passed " @entity119 " and ( for a brief moment ) " @entity64 6 " as the third highest grossing movie of the year			2
