-- for decades -- dating back to the 1980s -- @entity2 and @entity3 have had a deeply troubled relationship			1
the most recent phase of their ongoing struggle has been over whether @entity8 ( @entity3 's hugely popular proprietary format for adding animation , video , and interactivity to web pages ) would run on @entity2 mobile devices			1
@entity2 has always resisted putting flash on the @entity15 , because @entity8 has performed notoriously poorly on @entity17 computers			1
but these days internet access is swiftly going mobile , and @entity2 's @entity15 holds the most interactivity - and video - hungry portion of the smartphone market			1
@entity2 does offer a mobile app that re-encodes @entity24 videos to play on the @entity15 , but in general @entity8 elements wo n't play on @entity2 mobile devices			1
so @entity3 has been trying hard to get @entity2 to support @entity8 on the @entity15 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
it looks like @entity3 has finally lost this battle			0
last week @entity3 released @entity30 -- an experimental new drag - and - drop tool for developers that converts @entity8 files into @entity34			1
@entity34 is an emerging web standard that can work with the fully featured browsers available on most mobile devices , including the @entity15 and @entity26			1
it allows developers to build mobile web pages that are much more interactive and multimedia - rich			0
( technically , it 's now called just @entity34 , but most people are still saying " @entity34 " to refer to the new capabilities			2
) also , @entity34 can be used to build mobile apps that work offline			2
as @entity46 recently explained , @entity34 web apps " can still function in areas with no connection			2
gamers , for instance , can continue playing uninterrupted even if their device loses its signal			0
" in january , the @entity52 reported that many online content services , including @entity54 and @entity55 , are experimenting with using @entity34 to deliver video and other rich media , probably driven in part by @entity2 's lack of mobile support for @entity8			1
the @entity61 reports that @entity30 ( a program that runs on the @entity65 platform , which does work with @entity2 's @entity68 mobile operating system ) " was tested with @entity62			1
the only supported @entity70 browsers at this time are @entity72 and @entity73 on @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity62			0
" what does this mean for @entity15 users ? if @entity30 becomes popular with developers , then many websites that use @entity8 to present interactive features or multimedia content -- anything from videos to games to simulations and more -- may suddenly start working right on the @entity15 and @entity26			2
so @entity15 and @entity26 users will encounter fewer of those annoying blank holes on web pages where multimedia is supposed to appear			2
but in the big picture , if most internet access goes mobile ( as @entity91 predicted will happen by 2013 ) , then there might be less and less reason for web developers to use @entity8			2
it could be that @entity34 might become the norm , and @entity8 might fade into the mists of tech history			2
@entity100 predicted @entity3 's move to accommodate @entity34 almost a year ago , in his brilliant mock - biblical chronicle of the history of @entity3 vs. @entity2 , an amazingly entertaining read			1
@entity100 wrote : " ... and @entity3 saw four horsemen of the apocalypse ascending from the sea , the rider of the white horse was @entity110 and he was bent on conquest			0
and a second horse , red , was given to @entity15 to take away market share from smartphones , and to cause phone makers to wage war and to fall upon their own swords			0
" and a third horse , black , was carrying the scales of the @entity27 , and it measured out music playback from @entity121 and sold many apps and starved other mobile platforms of mobile application demand			0
and fourth horse , pale , had a rider named @entity26 , which pundits called @entity129			0
and it caused famine for tablets and plague for slates and killed with a sword			0
and none of the horsemen used @entity8			0
" and @entity138 woke from its vision of terrors , and realized that its days of monopolizing the web with @entity8 content were over			0
" ... and then @entity3 began building html5 development tools , and it charged reasonable prices and built cross-platform products and the people rejoiced and @entity3 's death was spared and it lived comfortably for many days next to @entity2			1
" and @entity110 said thank you and @entity3 said no , thank you			0
and they all lived happily ever after			0

@entity3 's flash does not work on @entity2 's *iphones* or @entity26
@entity3 is releasing an application that will convert @entity8 into @entity34
@entity34 is a new web standard aimed at working on most browsers and mobile devices .
