-- for @entity3 , losing both legs in a life - threatening crash was only the beginning of a new chapter			1
this year , the @entity7 racing driver , who has competed in @entity8 and indycar series , added two @entity11 gold medals and a win in the @entity14 's handcycle division to his career highlights			1
reflecting on what lies next , he says : " i have to tell you that the possibilities are not lacking in my life , and this is something for which i feel very lucky			2
" at school , @entity3 did n't compete in sports much , " because i was really fat as a kid			1
" after his sister was killed in a car crash his parents were eager to keep him off the road -- but they did allow @entity3 to race go - karts			1
" i clearly remember that first day on the go - kart being the best in my life , " he says			2
@entity3 first raced in @entity8 in 1992			1
after a contract with @entity32 ended , he switched to indycar racing , ultimately winning two championships			0
in @entity35 he became a popular driver , making a signature move out of performing post-race donuts on the track , and earning the nickname @entity41 ( a reference to a character in ' 80s sitcom " taxi " )			1
the crash in 2001 , @entity3 was leading in a @entity48 car race at @entity49 in @entity50 , with 13 laps to go			1
but as he emerged from a final pit - stop , something went wrong			0
" i lost control of the car in the acceleration lane , spun around and basically ended up ... a sitting duck in the middle of the racing line			2
" @entity3 awaited his fate as his fellow drivers sped by at more than 350mph			1
struck by the second car to pass , his car -- and his body -- were effectively sliced in two			0
the blood loss was massive			0
" it was like having the sink opened , " he says			0
" both arteries were completely ripped apart ; the amputation was immediate			0
" as a racecar driver , he 'd had plenty of opportunity to ponder how he would react to such a fate			1
" i said i would probably kill myself , " @entity3 says			1
" then i found myself in this situation and that thought never went through my mind			0
" " i had a clear perception that i had cheated death			0
i was very happy , and full of joy at being alive			0
" friends and family worried about how he would manage to get by without legs			2
but @entity3 says the question he asked himself on emerging from a coma was " not that much different in the wording , but technically very different			1
" it was : " my question was , how the hell am i going to do all the things i have to do with no legs ? " his attitude was one of " pure curiosity			1
" " i knew i was going to find a way to overcome my problems , " he adds			0
more from @entity96 : from builder to @entity99 - winning architect being a professional athlete served @entity3 well during his rehabilitation -- he already knew that it simply takes persistence to achieve a good result			1
" having been involved in sport a long time made me learn that you can not magically make things happen overnight			1
you can only do what you can each day , and take the next day to add to what you have done the previous day			0
" " the method which allowed me to get out of my troubles was setting a list of priorities , as i did previously in sport , preparing a race			2
" " my first goal was to try to get out of that bed , and then to get rid of all those tubes and wires that were keeping me alive			0
then go on the toilet on my own and then , step - by - step -- very metaphorical in my case -- slowly , i got to the point of thinking about rehabilitation over a pair of prosthetic legs			1
" the comeback within a year , he had crossed all of those problems off his list			2
two years later , @entity3 returned to @entity49 to complete his 13 laps , averaging nearly 200mph in a hand - operated car			1
three years later , he was contracted to race for @entity134 in the @entity135			0
four years later , he won a @entity137 race , using his hip to work a modified brake pedal attached to a prosthetic leg , an accelerating device mounted under the steering wheel , and a clutch mechanism worked by hand			2
he celebrated by doing donuts on the track			0
five years later , he was back in a modified @entity134 @entity8 car , steering with one hand and accelerating with the other			0
he was again subject to the same dangers , but says " life itself is that way			0
" " the simple fact that we are alive and breathe means we have something to lose			0
in this philosophical way , i found it absolutely normal to jump back in the car and do things as i did before			2
" i knew that if there was a way to connect my brain to the racing car , i would be the same driver as before			2
" if anything , he says , he is now less vulnerable than before : " if i break one of my legs , it only takes a 4mm screw to fix it			2
" more from @entity96 : opera singers are athletes @entity171 it was an invitation to speak at the 2007 @entity14 that first inspired @entity3 to try handcycling			1
" i thought , since i 'm there , i may as well do the marathon , " he says			0
with only a month 's preparation , he finished fourth in his division , discovering that , not only was handcycling a great way to keep fit , but it also allowed him to apply his knowledge of aerodynamics			2
by 2009 , he had a new goal in his sights -- the @entity183			0
as well as physical training to prepare , @entity3 spent hours working as his own race engineer , fine - tuning his cycle until it perfectly complemented his body			1
" every athlete has different needs , because every athlete has different residual abilities ... you have to modify in order to find the perfect machine for you			0
" just as a racecar driver must interpret what the instruments on his dashboard reveal , @entity3 says he also had to learn to interpret his own body 's inputs and outputs			1
" there 's nothing you can do about power in a racing car , other than telling your engineers your engine does n't sound or feel as good as it should ... here , i 'm the engine			0
i need to be aware of what 's going on ... " a year after winning the handcycling division of the @entity14 -- completing the race in one hour , 13 minutes and 58 seconds -- @entity3 won golds in both the @entity218 men 's road and time trial races at the @entity183			1
@entity220 was sweet , but being a paralympian was also fulfilling because , @entity3 says , " finally , i saw people realizing what kind of message can come out of sport in general			1
" " you are surprised by the result they 're achieving , but you ca n't help but think , the starting point for these guys was much further back than yours			0

@entity7 racecar driver @entity3 lost his legs in an @entity235 crash in 2001
this year , he won two handcycling gold medals at the @entity238
recovering from his *injuries* and mastering a new sport is a matter of taking things step by step , he says .
