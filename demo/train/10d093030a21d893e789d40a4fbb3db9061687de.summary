' more than a club			0
' that 's the long - standing motto and image that @entity4 football club has wished upon the world for many years			1
it is an image the club has carefully cultivated over decades , but could the deal that brought @entity11 star @entity10 to the club in june 2013 result in the @entity14 giants being known for more than just their football - and not in a good way ? for the mood drifting out of @entity19 , a stadium that has long been revered as a temple of the global game , is one of disarray			1
@entity4 , as if anyone needs reminding , is one of world football 's most successful clubs on the pitch			2
over the last few years it has patented a brand of football that has swept all before it , winning admirers around the world			0
off the pitch , the club prides itself on its all - round approach to life , keen to portray its ' open , integrating and caring ' side and having refused sponsorship on its shirts for many years because taking money for it sullied the spirit of the game			0
perhaps more significantly , @entity4 has long stood as an emblem for the region of @entity48 - " a way to show what @entity48 is in the world , " as @entity49 recently told @entity50 - with @entity4 widely portrayed as a political spearhead in the bid to fulfill the ideal of independence from @entity14			2
but now @entity4 finds itself in the dock			2
last month , a @entity14 judge ordered an inquiry into the @entity10 deal after a member of the fan - owned club , @entity65 , alleged a misappropriation of funds during the transfer			1
cases ' primary complaint was that the amount paid to bring @entity10 from @entity11 club @entity72 was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million euros			1
in fact , as the club has since admitted , @entity4 paid 86.2 million euros for @entity10			1
one day after the judge agreed to hear the case , @entity4 president @entity78 -- against whom the case was opened -- relinquished his prestigious position despite denying any wrongdoing			1
he was swiftly replaced by vice-president @entity82 , but therein lay another problem			0
the new man could also become embroiled in a judicial inquiry if @entity65 chooses to take action against him			2
" we brought the case against @entity78 but when we saw the contracts , we saw that they had also been signed by @entity82 , " @entity87 , @entity88 ' lawyer , told @entity89			2
@entity92 says the new president 's name is on all but two of the many contracts @entity4 signed to lure @entity10			1
he added that vice-president @entity97 signed the other two , meaning he too could face legal action			1
@entity97 had also been in the spotlight for another reason			0
he was a rare public victim of @entity102 's ire when the @entity4 superstar took umbrage to @entity97 ' comments in december that the club had no obligation to review the @entity109 's contract ( set to expire in 2018 )			1
" @entity4 is the best club in the world and should be represented by the best board members too , " the normally mild - mannered @entity102 exploded			1
" @entity112 is someone who knows nothing about football			0
" criticism of @entity4 tends to come from the direction of the @entity14 capital , where great rivals @entity118 are based , and certainly not from within - a warning that all was not well at the home of the four - time @entity122 champions			2
' no damage to @entity124 ' more embarrassment came a day after @entity78 's resignation as new president @entity82 held a press conference which outlined that there had , indeed , been a lack of clarity over the total fee paid to bring in @entity10			1
nearly 30 million euros was added to the original figure , including a signing fee for the player , an agreement with @entity11 club @entity72 concerning academy footballers and a commission to @entity10 's father and agent , @entity141 , among other measures			1
with his name on the contract , @entity82 clearly knew the details but @entity4 say the new man will not be stepping down since he does not believe he has done anything wrong			2
@entity97 is insistent that @entity4 's famous brand has not been dented by the furore			2
" not at all , " he rallied in a statement to @entity50			0
" @entity4 is a very lively and democratic club -- owned by its fans -- this is part of the beauty of our institution and we have to respect it			1
we have not noticed during these weeks any damage to our brand - to the contrary in fact			0
" " all our main sponsors have endorsed us and we are advancing with new and exciting deals that we will announce shortly			0
" yet @entity97 ' viewpoint directly contradicts the club 's own spokesperson , @entity162 , when he was trying to get cases to withdraw his lawsuit against @entity78			1
" ( @entity4 ) regrets not having the information requested ( by @entity88 ) earlier , which could have avoided the damage that this affair has caused to the image of the club , " read a statement by @entity167 on the eve of the judge 's decision to order an inquiry			1
it 's a sentiment with which blogger @entity178 wholeheartedly agrees			0
" it is clear that this whole incident can greatly damage the image of @entity4 , " @entity178 , who has extensively examined the transfer , told @entity50			1
" based on previous public cases , i think the judge will pull on a loose thread - meaning that he has received a complaint about one misdemeanor but may end up unraveling more			0
" " lots of things might come out in the coming months			0
" there is certainly a lot to grapple with			0
convoluted contracts for a start , the judge has to make sense of all the business personnel connected with @entity10			2
these include @entity199 's richest man , @entity200 ( whose @entity202 group controls the player 's image rights ) , and one of the country 's most famous footballers , @entity208 , who was on @entity199 's victorious 2002 @entity210 squad			0
@entity208 now has a sports marketing firm , 9ine , which took control of @entity10 's commercial rights in 2011 from @entity214 , one of @entity10 's two agents			2
the player 's other agent , his father , has set up several companies dealing with @entity10 's affairs but it 's the one he founded in october 2011 - @entity220 - that is likely to most interest the judge investigating @entity88 ' claims			0
having signed an initial agreement with @entity4 in late 2011 over @entity10 's potential transfer , @entity220 received a massive 40 million euros when the deal went through last year			1
the total dwarfs the 17.1m @entity4 paid to @entity72 for the transfer , so it 's no surprise it 's come under intense scrutiny			1
and it 's not just the judge poring over the details			0
@entity10 's former club @entity72 is also unhappy with the revelation and is putting a legal case together to try to obtain full details			1
the @entity11 club held 55 % of @entity10 's economic rights but two other companies - @entity241 ( 40 % ) and @entity242 ( 5 % ) - also believe they have missed out on the windfall			1
angered by receiving 40 % of just 17.1m euros rather than 57.1m or even 86.2m euros , @entity241 is reported to be considering taking its legal action further - as it ponders a lawsuit against @entity4 , @entity72 , @entity248 and @entity249			1
so is it any surprise , when you consider the complexity of the transfer , that @entity254 is so opposed to third - party ownership - where a player is not just owned by a club , but also other parties , in a practice that has become routine in @entity260 ? in fact , the game 's governing body has the power to investigate the transfer -- with a spokesperson telling @entity50 this would happen if " in accordance with the @entity269 , the chairman of the @entity271 decides ex officio to open investigation			1
" this remains a mere technical possibility but should it come to pass , such a move could cast another shadow over @entity4 's reputation			0
' @entity279 ' ? there are other troubling issues			0
when @entity78 stepped down , he revealed a sinister element as he said his family had suffered threats , with media reports in @entity14 detailing how his home had been shot at over the @entity289 holidays			1
no one was home at the time			0
in a different move , the @entity4 board - once so resistant to bearing a sponsor 's name on the team 's jerseys - is now considering attaching a sponsor 's name to the iconic @entity19 to fund a proposed 600m @entity301 redevelopment of the stadium and other facilities			0
" we will present a commercial name for the stadium to the @entity307			0
it will always just be a surname because we will not lose the name @entity19 , " vice-president @entity97 said on the club 's website earlier this month			0
@entity4 say stadium title rights could generate 150m euros for a club that is well over 300m euros in debt , so one can understand the board 's thinking , but it 's a controversial move nonetheless			2
balancing financial gain with prized ethics can be a challenge , especially when under investigation by a @entity14 judge over alleged transfer irregularities			0
can it be said that @entity4 is beginning to become ' @entity279 ' ?			0

@entity4 say *impending* inquiry into @entity10 transfer has not damaged club
*current* president and vice president could also face legal action
former president @entity78 quit because of *row* last month while revealing threats
transfer could potentially be investigated by @entity254
