-- @entity1 recently published its first hebrew language edition in @entity3 -- but has anyone actually been reading the articles to notice ? according to the publisher of the magazine , launched three months ago with @entity3 model @entity8 on the cover and an interview with a former @entity3 intelligence chief between the sheets , the country is finally ready for a @entity15			1
" it 's a time when @entity3 is really joining the family of modern nations , and @entity1 is just part of modern global culture , " says @entity16 , who emigrated from his native @entity17 to @entity3 15 months ago			1
" the brand has been popular ( in @entity3 ) for a long time and a @entity25 can really reach the entire market , whereas the @entity28 language version is really a niche commodity			0
" with its third issue about to hit the newsstands , @entity16 contends that the public are becoming more comfortable with the magazine 's content , while interest from potential advertisers , interview subjects and potential @entity1 " bunnies " is growing -- the magazine 's website has a form for would - be models to apply			1
" so far we have n't had a negative reaction , " says @entity16 , who acknowledges that many conservative and ultra-orthodox religious groups would " not want to interact with the brand			2

@entity54 , the publisher who introduced @entity55 into the country in 1989 , remembers a torrid 11 months before she sold the title			2
the reaction by religious groups was so fierce that the printing press was threatened with arson			2
" it was n't easy , " she said			0
" good luck to ( @entity1 ) , i think they are brave			1
@entity3 is open in some ways but in magazines , no. " @entity67 admits that she wanted a marketing gimmick that would cause a stir , but maintains that the magazine was introduced for more than just shock value , standing for a more liberal , secular society			2
" back then , secular jews did n't think they had rights , " she says			0
some observers believe that reading the @entity15 edition of @entity1 could still be seen as political statement			1
" @entity1 makes a very specific claim , " says @entity79 , the @entity80 author and commentator on gender studies			1
" it does n't see itself as political , but it is political -- it advocates for hedonism and sexual pleasure and the right for women to bare their body in public ... those are deeply political statements in @entity3 in a way that they are not really political in other countries			0
" however , for those on @entity3 's liberal left , @entity1 's arrival in @entity15 is more like dusting off a relic from a bygone era			1
" if you want nudity , there 's the internet , " says @entity101 , a blogger for the @entity102			1
" i 'm not seeing very much fuss ( in public about the launch of the magazine )			1
if they wanted to be interesting , they should have women wearing prayer shawls -- and only prayer shawls -- standing in front of the @entity117 ( @entity117 )			0
" that might be scandalous , controversial , and at least something that we 've not seen before			2
unless the articles are holding their own merit , i do n't see the interest , " she said , noting that the @entity15 edition 's @entity124 page has only around 5,800 " likes			1
" gallery : @entity132 's stunning skyline content aside , launching a new print publication , albeit with a well - known brand name , is still something of a business risk , when increasingly people use internet to find whatever they want , mostly for free			1
" we do n't see ourselves as a magazine company , " says @entity16			0
" high - quality content is what we provide			0
we are going to relaunch our website and give our audience a whole other avenue to reach us			0
what we 've found is that the printed magazine gives us a certain gravitas			0
" from a business standpoint , the launch could be seen as part of the brand 's global strategy to diversify , as its magazine sales have steadily declined since their high point in the 1970s			1
according to a recent report in the @entity159 , the @entity80 print publication loses around $ 6 million each year and uses licensing to international editions as a way to offset the losses			0
the familiar bunny logo is now more likely to be seen on clothing , jewelry , luggage or condoms than magazine covers			0
for all the potential pitfalls of print publishing and dealing with controversial content , @entity16 remains bullish about the magazine 's ability to push a few boundaries			2
" from the statistics on our website and @entity124 , we can tell that a number of our followers are @entity182 speakers and @entity183 within @entity3 and neighboring countries , " he says			0
" we are looking forward to putting together special content specifically to target the @entity182 market			0
we 've seen so far a real interest that we want to encourage			0
