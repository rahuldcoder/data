-- you ca n't get much more " inside baseball " than this : the story of how statisticians trump scouts when it comes to putting together a winning team			1
but thanks to a great script by @entity11 and @entity12 , a quietly compelling performance from @entity14 and shrewd direction by @entity16 ( " @entity17 " ) , " @entity20 " should appeal to audiences well beyond sports fans			1
it 's one of the classiest movies of the year and a strong bet for a ribbon of @entity26 nominations			2
@entity28 ' book chronicled the 2002 season of the @entity30 , when general manager @entity31 infuriated conventional wisdom by applying " sabermetrics " to squad selection			2
because the @entity30 could n't compete with wealthier teams for the big hitters , he looked to a different set of criteria , and especially at on - base percentages			2
it did n't have to be pretty			2
if the @entity30 walked their way to the @entity43 , that would be just fine			0
there 's a conventional revenge - of - the - underdogs scenario lurking beneath the surface : something like " @entity48 " and " @entity49			0
" there 's the catcher who is drafted in to play first base ( @entity53 as @entity54 ) , the pitcher with the wacky arm ( @entity57 as @entity58 ) and the star who spends too much time partying in @entity61 ( @entity62 as @entity63 )			0
mostly , though , " @entity20 " ignores the @entity64 © s by keeping the focus off the field and on @entity31 and his new statistics guru @entity68 ( @entity69 )			1
they make a great odd couple , and because the roles have been cast so well , @entity16 does n't need to labor the point			0
@entity14 is the ex-golden boy grown restive with a game he feels he ca n't win			1
@entity69 's an overweight computer geek straight out of @entity78 , the only guy wearing a suit to work			0
naturally authoritative and at ease with himself -- except when a game 's on ( he ca n't bring himself to watch but ca n't resist checking in every other minute ) -- @entity31 takes this awkward , earnest kid under his arm and shows him the ropes : how to cut players , how to trade			0
it 's an unsentimental education for @entity68 and for us , too , as unexpectedly entertaining as the entrepreneurial maneuvers in " @entity93			0
" this is the everyday business of baseball , a side we might read about but rarely see for ourselves			2
the movie falls into a more familiar groove when the @entity30 season turns , and there is n't much @entity16 or anyone else can do to make short flashbacks to @entity31 's playing days anything other than functional			0
but the writing is always sharp and smart , it 's lovingly photographed and delicately scored ( by @entity106 and @entity107 , respectively )			1
yet it 's @entity14 's movie			1
whether he 's brooding in the dark as the @entity30 lose again , having it out with the team 's recalcitrant coach ( @entity115 in a thankless role ) and angry head scout ( @entity117 ) , or trying to reassure his precocious 12 - year - old ( @entity119 ) that his head is n't really on the block , @entity14 has a watchful , introspective quality that makes " @entity20 " more than the sum of its statistical components			1
it 's a fascinating portrait of a man who 's given his life to baseball and is trying to figure out if it 's worth it			1
the movie itself is not a game changer by any means , but it 's more than good enough to make you think again about what success adds up to in the long run .			0
