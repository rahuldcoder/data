@entity0 -- at least 17 children and 14 women had been killed as of midafternoon july 20 , in the 24 hours since @entity7 forces had launched ground operations in the @entity10 neighborhood of @entity11 , the @entity2 reported			1
those numbers will rise : many bodies are still in the rubble			0
ambulances came under attack and could n't reach the wounded , witnesses said , and survivors fleeing tank shells and airstrikes did n't know how many of their relatives had been killed			1
at around that time , @entity22 of @entity24 's " @entity23 " asked @entity26 secretary of state @entity25 for his response to @entity29 statements accusing @entity7 of committing " a massacre and a war crime " in @entity10			2
" that 's rhetoric that we 've heard many , many times , " he answered			0
" what they need to do is stop rocketing @entity7 and accept a cease - fire			1
" @entity38 and other @entity29 armed groups do indeed need to stop rocketing @entity7 population centers			1
@entity41 killed an @entity7 @entity43 man and wounded his wife and children on july 19 , and badly injured two girls last week			2
such strikes using inherently indiscriminate rockets violate the laws of war			0
but the " they " @entity25 referred to are the warring parties , not the civilians			2
the message @entity7 needs to hear from its most important ally is not that " @entity56 is ugly , and bad things are going to happen , " as @entity25 put it			2
a more meaningful assessment is the one @entity25 shared , with apparent irony , with an aide when he mistakenly thought he was off - mic on @entity62 : " it 's a hell of a pinpoint operation			0
" the 17 chronically ill , elderly and paralyzed patients in the @entity66 , in @entity67 , can tell you it 's no pinpoint operation , if that is supposed to mean that civilian structures are being spared			0
@entity7 forces hit the hospital at least three times from july 11 to 17 , with missiles and tank rounds			2
amid these attacks , the @entity7 military warned hospital staff to evacuate			1
but , the hospital director said , " there is no other hospital in @entity11 equipped for our patients			0
" they finally evacuated under fire on the night of july 17			0
the electricity was cut off , patients lost their oxygen supply , attacks started a fire on the upper floors , and nurses , coughing in the smoke , carried patients -- none of them mobile -- downstairs and into ambulances			2
the @entity7 military has variously claimed that rockets were stored or launched from areas near the hospital , but not that the hospital was used for enemy military operations harmful to its own forces			1
the fact that @entity7 , using accurate guided missiles and direct tank fire , struck the hospital over several days , suggests intentional or reckless attacks on the hospital , which are war crimes			1
@entity29 fighters are among the dead in @entity11			0
and not all civilian casualties are the product of violations of the laws of war			0
@entity29 armed groups also unnecessarily put civilians at risk by deploying near crowded apartments or , as in two known incidents , storing rockets in empty schools			0
but under the laws of war , civilians who do not join in the fight are always to be protected			0
it 's good that @entity7 forces often give warnings , but that does n't give @entity7 legal license to attack civilians left behind or to proceed with little concern for their welfare			1
nor can it assume that anyone left in a " warned " area is a fighter , because there are many reasons , from infirmity to fear to having no place to go , why civilians do n't heed warnings to flee			1
one crucial element in any lawful attack is that it is directed at a reasonably certain military target			2
but in a number of airstrikes before the ground invasion that @entity147 investigated , we found no evidence of a lawful military objective			1
there was none evident at the @entity152 © , where an @entity7 attack on july 11 killed nine civilians , including two boys , who had gathered to watch the @entity157			1
the four boys killed and three wounded by @entity7 strikes near the @entity160 , on the @entity11 beachfront , were not lawful military targets			1
the military said it was targeting a terrorist in the beach @entity152 © , but did n't supply a name or other information to back the claim , or explain why it had to kill that unidentified person when he was surrounded by civilians			1
and it said it had mistaken the boys wounded in the latter attack for " fleeing fighters , " even though anyone would flee a building being attacked			0
these are not tragic accidents			0
they fit an apparent pattern of shooting first , determining whether there was a lawful target later			0
the policy of the @entity26 in response is inadequate			0
on july 21 , @entity25 announced that the @entity26 is " providing $ 47 million to address the humanitarian situation in @entity11			0
" these funds are desperately needed			0
but nothing has been said about curbing the killing of civilians , addressing the years of impunity for such grave violations of the laws of war , much less suspending transfers of military materiel that @entity7 has been using to commit what we find to be illegal acts			1
dismal as @entity7 's record is in prosecuting war crimes , @entity38 has prosecuted no one			1
@entity204 @entity29 leaders have intimated they may seek access to the @entity206 , which would then have jurisdiction over indiscriminate rocket attacks from @entity11 as well as unlawful @entity7 airstrikes , insofar as @entity7 and @entity29 authorities refused to prosecute their own			1
closing the accountability gap could help deter attacks on civilians , but the @entity26 , which has long blocked international accountability for @entity7 violations , steadfastly opposes the @entity29 move			1
it is long past time to reverse that position			0
what is @entity7 's endgame in @entity11 ?			2

@entity147 says some @entity7 airstrikes had no lawful military objective
@entity225 : @entity38 also needs to stop rocketing @entity7 population centers
he says warnings do n't give @entity7 license to kill civilians left behind or ignore their welfare
@entity206 would have jurisdiction over rocket attacks , airstrikes
