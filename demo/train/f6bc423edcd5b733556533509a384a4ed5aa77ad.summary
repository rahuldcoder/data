@entity0 , @entity1 -- children in war - ravaged @entity1 are safer than those growing up in @entity8 or @entity9 , @entity4 's top civilian envoy says			1
@entity10 , the senior civilian representative for @entity4 , made the comments on an episode of @entity14 's " @entity13 , " which is airing monday			1
in the show -- a @entity17 current - affairs program for children -- several youngsters in @entity0 , @entity1 , say they are afraid of daily violence and the frequent explosions in their war - torn country			1
in response , @entity10 says : " here in @entity0 , and other big cities actually , there are very few of these bombs			1
the children are probably safer here than they would be in @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity30 or many other cities			0
" most children can go about their lives in safety			1
it 's a very family - oriented society			2
so it is a little bit like a city of villages , " he added			0
a @entity41 report released earlier this year seems to contradict @entity43 's assessment			0
the february report , by the special representative for children and armed conflict , says that children in @entity1 are increasingly the victims of roadside attacks , crossfire between militants and international forces , and air strikes			1
in addition , they have been used as human shields and recruited as suicide bombers			0
the report also said boys are sexually abused and exploited by armed groups and girls schools have been burned down			0
earlier this year , there was a rash of poisonings involving schoolgirls , and several instances of acid attacks have been reported			0
on monday , @entity10 elaborated on what he meant in his remark			2
" any comment you have to clarify obviously was n't very well put and the comparison i made with western cities distracted attention from the important point i was seeking to make , " he said			0
" i was trying to explain to an audience of @entity76 children how uneven violence is across @entity1			1
half the insurgent violence takes place in 10 of the 365 districts , and , in those places , children are too often the victims of ieds and other dangers			0
but , in cities like @entity0 where security has improved , the total levels of violence , including criminal violence , are comparable to those which many western children would experience			2
" for most @entity1 , the biggest challenges are from poverty -- the absence of clean water , open sewers , malnutrition , disease -- and many more children are at risk from those problems than from the insurgency			2

new : @entity105 took away from point he was trying to make , @entity10 says
despite @entity1 children 's fears , there are few bombs in @entity0 , the envoy says
he makes his comments on a @entity17 current - affairs program for children
" most children can go about their lives in safety " in @entity0 , he says
