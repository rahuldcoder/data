-- @entity1 for @entity2 is around the corner , but new satellite images released wednesday reveal a heavy north @entity6 military presence in an oil - rich border region			1
images from the @entity10 - based @entity9 showed an apparent @entity13 ( @entity12 ) convoy of " significant size " traveling through the town of @entity16			2
the monitoring group , started by actor @entity18 , said the convoy was 2 kilometers in length and had about 1,000 troops			1
there were heavy transport trucks carrying artillery			0
" less than a week after signing yet another agreement , the @entity6 regime appears to be ignoring its commitment , holding to form , and positioning military assets for intensified offensive operations , " said @entity25 , co-founder of the @entity26 , which aims to end genocide and war crimes			1
" this cycle will continue to be played out with increasingly destructive results for @entity6 civilians until the international community stiffens its spine and imposes swift and severe repercussions for the endless cycle of violence the @entity43 regime continues to fuel			2
" the @entity9 combines satellite imagery analysis and field reports with mapping technology in hopes of deterring the resumption of the bloody and bitter civil war north and south fought for decades			1
the monitoring group said regular fighting between the @entity6 forces and the south 's @entity53 has been reported in the city of @entity16 in the past week			1
@entity56 voted for independence in a january referendum , and with the scheduled july 9 date of separation looming , many fear an escalation of bloodshed could bring both sides back to the brink of full scale war			1
@entity66 erupted two months ago along the contested border area of @entity68 and subsequently in @entity69 , a state that lies north of the border but where many people , especially in the @entity72 , are allied with the south			1
thousands of people were displaced from their homes , and many fear that after strict borders go into place with independence , they will not be able to return home			0
" @entity2 will be born into crisis , " said @entity81 , who oversees @entity83 aid programs in @entity2			2
" widening violence is triggering more displacement , threatening the lives of vulnerable civilians and hampering access to communities in need while an existing humanitarian emergency grows worse , " she said			0
critical issues -- including oil and the final status of @entity68 -- remain unresolved just days ahead of independence			0
@entity98 spokeswoman @entity97 said the @entity10 applauded talks between north and south but remained concerned about the unresolved matters			2
" the @entity10 also calls on the parties to end the fighting in @entity69 , and to facilitate unfettered access for aid workers to deliver humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians affected by the conflict , " @entity97 said			0
discussions are under way on how to shape the new post-independence @entity112 mission in @entity2 , created in 2005 with a peacekeeping mandate			0
and the @entity112 @entity114 will meet next week to discuss whether to recommend a new member state 's entry into the global body			0
@entity118 , the @entity112 ambassador of @entity119 , which holds the rotating @entity114 presidency this month , said @entity121 will meet july 13 , four days after @entity2 's independence ceremony , to talk about @entity112 admission			1
if granted , @entity2 would become the first state since @entity125 in 2006 to become a @entity112 member			0
@entity0 's @entity127 and @entity128 contributed to this report .			0
