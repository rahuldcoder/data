-- how well do you know your margarine history ? let 's take a look at the origins of the butter substitute , and the dairy lobby 's attempts to defeat it			1
where did the name " margarine " originate ? in a chemist 's lab. @entity13 scientist @entity12 discovered a new fatty acid in 1813 that he dubbed acide margarique			0
@entity12 's discovery contained lustrous , pearly deposits , so he named it after the @entity21 word margarites , for " pearly			0
" did @entity12 take his margaric acid and head straight for the toaster ? not quite			0
if you enjoy margarine , tip your cap to emperor @entity28 saw that both his poorer subjects and his navy would benefit from having easy access to a cheap butter substitute , so he offered a prize for anyone who could create an adequate replacement			1
in 1869 , @entity36 perfected and patented a process for churning beef tallow with milk to create an acceptable butter substitute , thereby winning the @entity28 's prize			1
@entity0 : 10 foods that ( thankfully ) flopped so @entity36 became the first margarine tycoon ? far from it			0
despite @entity28 's high hopes for @entity48 ' product , which the scientist had dubbed " oleomargarine , " the market did n't really take off			0
in 1871 , @entity36 showed his process to a @entity53 company that improved on his methods and helped build an international market for margarine			0
the @entity53 entrepreneurs realized that if margarine were going to become a substitute for butter , it needed to look like butter , so they began dyeing margarine -- which is naturally white -- a buttery yellow			1
@entity36 did n't get a princely sum for his invention ; he actually died a pauper in 1880			0
the @entity53 company that improved upon his recipe did pretty well for itself , though			0
the company , @entity70 , eventually became a world - renowned maker of margarines and soaps and later became a part of @entity76			0
how did the dairy world react to margarine 's sudden popularity ? they were predictably more than a little irked			1
butter was big business , and the notion that a cheaper substitute , even one made in part with milk , might storm the market terrified dairy farmers			1
they did n't take the threat lying down , though , and convinced legislators to tax margarine at a rate of two cents per pound -- no small sum in the late 19th century			1
dairy farmers also successfully lobbied for restrictions that banned the use of yellow dyes to make margarine look more appetizing			1
by 1900 , artificially colored butter was contraband in 30 @entity102 states			0
several states took even more extreme measures to turn consumers away from margarine -- they required the product to be dyed an unappealing pink color			1
@entity0 : how @entity109 almost killed root beer did other countries enact similar restrictions ? if you think taxes and dyes are tough , then the @entity115 government 's anti-margarine campaign seems downright draconian			2
from 1886 until 1948 , @entity115 law banned any and all margarine			1
the only exception to this rule came between 1917 and 1923 , when @entity123 and its aftermath left butter in short supply and the government temporarily gave margarine the thumbs up			2
margarine did n't necessarily have an easier time after the ban was relaxed , either			2
@entity134 's strong dairy lobby ensured that rules against dyeing remained in place in the province until 2008			2
was there any way around these color restrictions ? sure			0
it sounds almost laughable now , but if you wanted to eat margarine on your toast without having to stare at its natural white color , there was a solution			0
as the coloring restrictions became widespread around the turn of the 20th century , margarine producers accepted that they could n't dye their wares yellow			1
there was no reason why they could n't simultaneously sell consumers margarine and yellow dye , though			1
when you bought a block or tube of margarine , you also got a packet of food coloring that could be kneaded into the margarine by hand			0
what helped margarine stay competitive with butter ? more restrictions , of course			2
paradoxically , the pure foods movement of the 1920s helped undermine natural butter and elevate the status of margarine			2
in 1923 @entity176 passed a law that made it illegal to add any other ingredients to butter , even additives that would help make the butter more spreadable			2
as any toast aficionado knows , margarine is a heck of a lot easier to spread than butter			2
suddenly , butter makers could n't tweak their products to make it easier to slather on breakfast , but margarine manufacturers could			1
margarine also got a bit bump from @entity197 when wartime butter scarcity forced consumers to switch to margarine , lots of margarine holdouts realized that the improved product was n't so bad after all			1
in 1950 , the @entity102 government repealed the heavy margarine tax , and the market continued to grow as individual states reversed their bans on colored margarine			0
the last state to repeal the ban on dyes ? you guessed it : @entity215			0
@entity102 's @entity216 did n't allow dyed margarine until 1967			1
