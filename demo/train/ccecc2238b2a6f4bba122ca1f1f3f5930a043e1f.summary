@entity7 amid massive global interest in the trial , appeal and retrial of @entity5 and @entity6 , it has been easy to overlook their alleged victim , @entity11 , who was found brutally murdered in the flat she shared with @entity13 in @entity14 in 2007			1
@entity13 and @entity6 were convicted of @entity16 's murder in 2009 but were acquitted and released from prison on appeal in 2011			1
in march 2013 , @entity14 's @entity19 overturned the pair 's acquittals , saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered			1

" i think we are still on the journey to the truth , " she said			2

" @entity16 , @entity11 's brother , said : " nothing is going to bring @entity11 back , nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her			1

" we are not interested in this book just like so many others about the case and we will not read it , " @entity73 said in a statement			2
" i have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life			1
something @entity11 will never have and something we can never share with her			2
@entity11 is the victim in this tragic case			2
