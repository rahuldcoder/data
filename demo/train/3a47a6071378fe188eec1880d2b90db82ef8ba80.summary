-- it 's official : @entity2 has stretched to october			0
@entity3 's " taken 2 " kicked its way back into the top slot for a second weekend with an estimated $ 22.5 million , and @entity8 's political thriller " @entity6 " and the @entity10 horror flick " @entity9 " were close second and third , respectively			1
the one - two - three punch helped boost the box office to a fabulous 47 percent gain over the same weekend in 2011 , when " @entity16 " slugged its way to a second no. 1 finish			2
while " @entity23 " continues to outpace the 2009 original — after 10 days , it 's notched $ 86.8 million , in comparison to @entity20 's $ 53.6 million total in the same time frame — it still dropped a hefty 54.6 percent from its astounding $ 49.5 million opening weekend			1
at that rate , it 'll be tough ( though not impossible ) for the film to ultimately best " taken 's " $ 145 million domestic gross			1
with $ 20.1 million , " @entity6 , " about the @entity29 mission to extract six @entity30 trapped in @entity31 during the 1979/1980 hostage crisis , did not quite beat @entity8 's 2010 @entity34 heist thriller " @entity35 , " which opened at no. 1 in 2010 with $ 23.8 million			1
but it 's still a big win for the actor - director , who could ride the film 's stellar reviews and superlative word - of - mouth — it earned a rare " a + " grade from @entity45 — all the way to the @entity43 in february			2
a full 52 percent of the audience was over 50 , with a 54/46 split between women and men			0
also a good sign for @entity8 's resurgent second career as a filmmaker : 20 percent of audiences reported seeing the film because he was the director			1
put it all together , and " @entity6 " appears to have a lot of life left in it			2
@entity58 : best movie about movie - making ? after leading the pack on friday , the quasi-found footage horror film " @entity9 , " produced by @entity62 and @entity63 ( @entity64 ) and directed by @entity65 ( " @entity66 " ) , ultimately fell to third with $ 18.3 million			1
it 's a respectable showing , besting studio @entity70 's expectations and making back its $ 3 million budget six times over , thanks to a savvy marketing campaign that began with the film 's surprise showing at the @entity76 in march			1
still , the opening was lower than last winter 's " @entity78 " ( $ 20.9 million ) or " @entity79 " ( $ 33.7 ) , and with a par - for - the - genre " @entity80 " @entity45 , the film better hope to vacuum up as much horror audience money as possible before @entity84 — also produced by @entity62 — blasts into theaters this coming weekend			1
so it 's clear that audiences were in a mood for thrills and chills this weekend			0
@entity92 , not so much			0
" @entity97 " whimpered into fifth place with $ 12 million , by far the worst opening weekend of star @entity95 ' career			1
the folks who did shell out to see the film did at least enjoy themselves : it earned an " a " @entity45 , with 46 percent of the audience under 25 years old			0
( " @entity106 , " in which @entity95 provides the voice of @entity108 , came in just ahead of boom , banking $ 17.3 million en route to passing the $ 100 million milestone in its third weekend , with $ 102.2 million total			1
) the meta crime comedy " @entity110 , " meanwhile , landed in ninth place , with a mere $ 4.3 million in 1,480 theaters for an unfortunate $ 2,889 per location average			0
it must be a frustrating result for distributor , @entity116 , which marshaled an eccentric grass - roots marketing campaign to sell the film 's offbeat sense of humor			0
at the very least , the company can be grateful it was n't releasing " @entity122 : @entity129 " the second half of the adaptation of @entity126 's epic seminal tome collapsed in 11th place with $ 1.7 million on 1,012 screens			2
that is just slightly better than 2011 ′ s " @entity122 : @entity131 , " which opened to $ 1.69 million — on 299 screens			0
elsewhere , " @entity135 " expanded to 726 theaters in its fourth weekend , pulling in $ 2.2 million for $ 6.2 million total			2
and the drama " @entity144 " — which won director @entity139 the best director award at the @entity141 — opened in six theaters to a healthy $ 13,000 per location average			0
