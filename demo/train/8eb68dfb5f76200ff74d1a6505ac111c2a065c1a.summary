@entity1 , @entity0 -- the current squabbling between the @entity4 and the @entity5 on the payroll tax cut extension perfectly epitomizes why congressional approval is in the single digits			1
highlighting this debacle , @entity9 ends his first television ad in @entity12 proclaiming that by " working together , we can and will rebuild the @entity14 we love			1
" expecting @entity9 to work together with @entity15 and @entity16 to end the partisan deadlock in @entity18 is a bit like asking the fox to guard the chicken coop			1
when @entity22 entered the @entity4 in 1979 , he quickly became the leader of a group of insurgent conservatives whose chief aim was a @entity28 majority			1
@entity22 's partisan antics not only transformed the @entity4 , but the @entity5 as well			1
@entity18 has not been the same since			0
even from his first term , when he tried to get rep. @entity30 kicked out of the @entity4 ( despite his re-election after being convicted of 29 felonies ) , it became clear that @entity22 would use every @entity15 misstep and every legislative opportunity to portray the @entity4 in the worst possible light			1
it was only in tearing down the @entity4 that @entity22 thought that it could be rebuilt in the @entity28 ' -- or perhaps , his -- own image			2
to @entity22 's credit , the @entity15 leadership was always ready to misstep and then meet him in the partisan mud			1
whether it was his fight with speaker @entity47 about who controlled the television cameras in the @entity4 or his relentless pursuit of speaker @entity52 's sweetheart book deal , @entity22 would not back down from a fight even if at first it appeared the evidence was against him			2
@entity22 became a master at using the legislative process to achieve his political goals			1
this strategy from @entity22 's @entity4 days is , of course , well known			1
what is less well known is that members who previously served with @entity22 in the @entity4 spread these highly partisan tactics to the @entity5			1
i am writing a book about these senators , who i call " @entity22 senators , " because they so seamlessly infected the @entity5 with the same hyper - partisanship that pervaded the @entity4			1
since @entity22 's first election to the @entity4 , 40 @entity16 have entered the @entity4 and then moved on to the @entity5			1
twenty - two of them continue to serve in the @entity5 , including @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
their alumni include @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
these senators learned well the lessons that @entity22 taught them in the @entity4			2
@entity81 , the first @entity22 senator to rise to an important party leadership position , had been a supporter of any and all tax cuts until @entity84 announced his desire to extend the payroll tax reduction			2
@entity81 was among the first @entity16 to announce his opposition , not just to how @entity84 wanted to fund the extension of the tax reduction , but the tax cut extension itself			0
this , incidentally , is the same @entity81 who said in an earlier debate : " if you want an abortion , you go to @entity96 , and that 's well over 90 % of what @entity96 does			0
" when confronted with the fact that abortions account for only 3 % of the organization 's work , @entity81 's spokesperson claimed that his floor statement " was not intended to be a factual statement			0
" when the @entity22 senators do n't have the votes to get their way , they will use all aspects of the legislative process to bring the rest of the chamber to its knees			1
in the last @entity115 , the @entity5 took 419 votes on roll call amendments			0
the 19 @entity22 senators who were serving at the time introduced more than half of these amendments			0
seven of the top 10 senators who introduced the most amendments that resulted in roll call votes were @entity22 senators			0
endlessly introducing amendments has become another form of filibustering , which previously involved making speeches rather than introducing amendments			0
but when a stream of amendments could n't defeat the health care bill , the @entity28 offered up a " stunt " amendment , its sole purpose to create a perception that @entity15 were voting against preventing sex offenders from buying @entity137 in the insurance markets established by the bill			0
@entity141 , a @entity22 senator , introduced the amendment			0
@entity22 's strategy was successful in 1994 when the @entity28 won a majority in the @entity4 and the @entity5			1
the strategy was also successful in 2010 after @entity145 and @entity146 implemented it in the @entity149 - run @entity4			2
the @entity22 senators are once again using it to try and take back the @entity5 in the 2012 elections			2
the chambers and parties may resolve their differences over the payroll tax cut extension , but it is unlikely that they will do so through the methods that @entity22 made popular during his congressional days			0
furthermore , if we can predict the future from their past record , the solution is not likely to come from the @entity22 senators			0
the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity167 : @entity9 's first ad in @entity12 *suggests* he 's ready to end partisan deadlock
but partisan antics have been his *signature* strategy since 1979 , says @entity167
@entity22 became a master at using the legislative process to achieve political goals , he says
@entity167 : some who served with @entity22 in @entity4 spread his partisan strategy to @entity5
