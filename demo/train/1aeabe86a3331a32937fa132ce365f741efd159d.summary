-- the @entity1 remains one of the few prestigious events where spectators can almost reach out and touch the riders -- or throw urine on them as @entity6 found out wednesday			1
the @entity8 rider , who was absolved of any wrongdoing following a collision with @entity11 just 24 hours earlier , was the target of an angry fan as he rode through the 33 kilometer individual time trial between @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity17			1
cycling fans are very much split over @entity6 -- with some unimpressed by his perceived arrogance and large ego , while others love his insatiable desire to win			2
@entity6 refused to speak about the incident after being doused with urine by an irate spectator during an afternoon which he will quickly want to forget			1
his @entity28 teammate @entity27 won the 11th stage with @entity30 retaining the yellow jersey , but it was @entity6 who was again in the limelight			1
" it is disappointing to hear about one individual like that , " @entity30 told reporters of the incident after extending his lead to three minutes and 25 seconds			1
" that 's one of the beauties of our sport			0
anyone can come and watch at the side of the road and enjoy the excitement and really get close to the top riders in the world			0
" @entity6 is one of the big characters in the sport , and some people love him , some people hate him			2
" but to do something disrespectful like that , that 's really sad			0
it ruins the whole atmosphere			0
" while it is thought to be the first time a cyclist has been assaulted in such a way during the @entity1 , there have been other instances where riders have been abused			1
in 1975 , @entity67 was punched in the kidneys during his quest to claim a sixth @entity1 victory , while @entity71 was given bodyguards in 2004 after being subjected to death threats			0
@entity6 has endured a couple of miserable days , missing out on a 25th stage win on tuesday , while slipping 103 points adrift of green jersey leader @entity77			1
meanwhile , @entity28 team manager @entity79 revealed that @entity6 was feeling ' sad ' following the incident			2
" i regret this , i always felt that cycling fans were gentlemen , enthusiastic people , " he told reporters " @entity6 is sad , he 's not upset , just sad			2
i can not blame anyone , there are 100,000 or 200,000 people on the road , and one person decided to do this			0
" on the road , @entity27 claimed an expected victory in the time trial after finishing 12 seconds ahead of @entity30			1
@entity27 , who had won his previous nine time trials in all competitions , finished the course with the third fastest time ever recorded on the @entity1			1
but the @entity97 revealed he began to worry when @entity30 appeared to be challenging for victory			1
" to be honest , i 'd almost given up hope of the stage win , " he told reporters			0
" it was starting to look very disappointing when i saw @entity30 beat my times at the intermediate check			0
" i nearly started to cry			0
i could n't believe it			0
i expected that @entity30 might get to within 30 seconds or something like that but not beating me at the intermediates			2
" now i 'm really happy and maybe it 's nicer to win this way			0
