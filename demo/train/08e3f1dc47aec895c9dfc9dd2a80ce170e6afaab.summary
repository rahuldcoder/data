-- is @entity1 forcing journalists to march in mindless lockstep ? on the surface , the notion seems absurd			1
media folks may hang out on @entity1 as the new cool - kids ' club , but is n't the point to broadcast your own brand ? why would anyone in the news racket want to echo what the rest of the gang is saying ? @entity18 columnist @entity17 conjured up the thesis after seeing hordes of colleagues tweeting away at a presidential debate			1
it is on all those laptop screens , he says , that " the conventional wisdom gels -- and subsequent tweets , except those from the most hardened partisans , increasingly reflect the @entity1 - forged consensus			1
" before explaining why this is utterly wrong -- ok , mostly wrong -- a little background on what has become a powerhouse social media network			2
@entity1 is the new @entity34 , i like to say , a place where journalists often break news , even before feeding it to their employers			1
this happened to me a couple of weeks back when i learned from a source while driving that @entity43 had signed a new four - year deal to run @entity45			0
i pulled over , tweeted it on my @entity47 and watched it ricochet across the @entity49 well before i could write an actual story			0
watch : why do reporters stand out in the rain ? this is a bit of a problem , as news organizations are n't getting the traffic from these posts			0
but they are still getting credit , and the truth is we have no choice but to be part of that conversation			0
with its plethora of links and more than 500 million users , @entity1 is a heck of a self - promotional vehicle for those trying ( sometimes relentlessly ) to publicize their own work			1
but the site can also be a minefield that claims journalists as collateral damage			2
precisely because it 's so instantaneous -- type 140 characters and click -- a growing number of media people have been fired , suspended or removed from stories for insensitive messages and jokes			2
it happened again recently when a @entity86 writer was put on hiatus for a month after insulting a female critic of his interview with an actress by saying the woman wished she could sleep her way to the top			0
@entity1 's clout extends well beyond those who check it every 10 minutes			1
since most journalists these days wants to know what 's " trending , " what 's hot on @entity1 quickly makes its way onto websites and cable news shows that desperately want a hipness injection			1
there is something uniquely democratic about this , because millions of ordinary people can " vote " a story -- or bit of silliness -- onto the national agenda			2
that breaks the power of the old media oligopoly			0
watch : are the media helping @entity115 measure the drapes ? of course , this zeitgeist - shaping can manifest itself in odd ways			0
when i was at the second presidential debate , i was blissfully unaware that @entity115 had stepped in it by uttering the phrase " binders full of women " until i noticed it exploding on my @entity1 feed			2
the campaigns have also used @entity1 as a weapon , not just by exchanging snarky tweets but by pushing mocking hashtags , or searchable phrases -- sometimes through " promoted tweets , " as @entity135 's side did with the " binders " comment			1
that brings me back to @entity17 's argument that @entity1 prods the journalistic lemmings in the same direction			1
they " want to make sure that their opinions are not veering from other opinions , " he told me			0
otherwise , " it 'll look like you do n't know what you 're talking about if you defy the conventional wisdom			1
" watch : female debate moderators slam - dunk the guys it 's worth noting that @entity154 started its @entity155 back in 1988 , well before we were all using the interwebs			0
and i 'm sure a few journalists rely on @entity1 as a digital weathervane to make sure they 're pointing in the right direction			1
but i view @entity1 as a cauldron of ideas -- some brilliant , some witty , some wacky			1
i see lots of people take issue with each other ( or with me ) , sometimes less than politely			0
since i make a point of following people on the left and right , i get revealing glimpses into what 's cooking across the spectrum			0
in this kind of crowded marketplace , most media people and civilians try to stand out with smart and edgy insights , rather than just repackage what everyone else is dishing			0
i guess it all comes down to who you follow and whether you escape the hall of mirrors by occasionally shutting the thing off			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 says it 's wrong to say @entity1 pressures journalists into a consensus
@entity1 allows users to broadcast their views ; *diverse* ones encouraged , he says
some journalists have followed conventional wisdom for decades , he says
@entity187 : @entity1 is a cauldron of ideas -- some brilliant , some witty , some wacky
