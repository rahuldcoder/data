-- when @entity2 is sworn in as president january 20 , there will be music -- by , among others , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and the @entity9			0
there will be prayers and speeches -- including @entity2 's inaugural address			0
and for the fourth time in the nation 's 56 inauguration ceremonies , there will be poetry -- by someone far less well - known			1
@entity19 says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle			1
after the president 's speech , @entity19 will read a poem she is writing for the occasion			1
@entity28 is a 46 - year - old @entity29 professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of @entity2 's			1
she joins three other poets who have read at inaugural ceremonies -- @entity34 in 1961 for @entity36 's inauguration and @entity37 and @entity38 , who read at @entity40 's 1993 and 1997 inaugurations			1
@entity28 has written five books of poetry , including " @entity43 , " a finalist for the @entity45 in 2005			1
her father is @entity28 , secretary of the army in the @entity49 administration , and her mother teaches history at @entity52			1
her brother is an adviser to @entity2 's transition team			0
@entity28 's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from " @entity43 " ( @entity58 ) : poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner , overhear on the bus , @entity66 / in the details , the only way to get from here to there			1
/ poetry ( and now my voice is rising ) is not all love , love , love , / and i 'm sorry the dog died			2
poetry ( here i hear myself loudest ) / is the human voice , and are we not of interest to each other ? @entity28 spoke friday to @entity0			1
@entity0 : what do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this ? @entity28 : i think that the fact that president - elect @entity2 has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language , the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause , a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle			1
@entity0 : you met @entity2 when you were both teaching at the @entity104 ? @entity28 : in the community in @entity107 , he and mrs. @entity105 were just people i 'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about , and we were of a generation			1
... he was in the law school , and i was in the @entity113 of @entity114 so our day - to - day work did n't really cross so much			0
... [ we were in ] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s , thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills , intellectual skills , skills in the discipline of law , in literature , artistic skills			2
that was the common ground , thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community			0
@entity0 : and you did it by writing ? @entity28 : by writing and teaching			1
i 've been a professor for many years now , and i now teach in the @entity132 and the @entity113 at @entity29			0
... my teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of @entity136 and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in			2
it 's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years			0
@entity0 : we have this historical moment , the 80th birthday of the rev. @entity146 , the inauguration of the first @entity149 - @entity149 president			2
how does that resonate with you ? @entity28 : it 's amazing , is n't it ? i just shake my head and say , " is n't that something ? " the civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an @entity149 - @entity149 president			1
at the same time , this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation 's history			0
i ca n't tell you how many older people have said to me , " i never thought i 'd live to see this day			2
" the fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is @entity149 really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there 's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us			0
@entity0 : what 's ahead of us ? @entity28 : oh my goodness , so much			1
there are wars or conflicts in many different places , there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places , there 's the tremendous challenge of the economy			0
... the larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are , if not post-partisan -- because i do n't think there 's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions			0
within our communities large and small , making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we 're going to have to do in order to make things better			0
@entity0 : can poetry help in that regard ? @entity28 : i do believe that it can			1
the way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful , because after all if we ca n't be precise with language , how can we share ideas ? also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions			2
you can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem , but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it , those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems			2
@entity0 : so you 're going to write a poem about health care ? @entity28 : that would be fun			1
of course , this [ poem for the inauguration ] is an occasional poem , it has to serve the moment , it has to serve the day , right ? so those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day			0
but of course , what i hope to do , rather than the laundry list poem , is to find language that will hopefully have a little resonance after the day is done			0
@entity0 : will you show it to anybody before you read it ? @entity28 : i show it to my husband [ artist @entity254 ] , and he is my first , last and best critic			1
@entity0 : you wrote an essay about @entity256 [ the @entity45 - winning african - american poet ] in which you said that " the pressure on creative work can be intense for artists who belong to groups still struggling for their fair shake in society			0
" and then later on you said you 've seen your work " overpraised by narrow - minded white critics " and " criticized small - mindedly by more than one black woman elder poet -- the same poets i imagined would be pleased by it			0
" your work is read very differently depending on who 's reading it ? @entity28 : i think what i was trying to say is that at the end of the day , demographics does n't really tell you about how your work is going to be received			1
... on the one hand , i have devoted much of my work to african - american culture			0
that 's my group , that 's who i am , [ i 'm ] proud and unambiguous about that -- but at the same time , one of the really great discoveries of a life in poetry has been that poetry is quirky			1
you really , really ca n't predict who is going to connect with various aspects of your work			0
that 's been a real gift to me ; it 's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work			0
@entity0 : you have two children ? @entity28 : two sons , 9 and 10			1
@entity0 : how do they feel about the poem ? @entity28 : they are so excited , and that 's of course a lovely thing			1
and in the excitement , we still live in our every day , so mommy is still mommy , and all the mommy things are expected of me , and that 's the way i like it			0
@entity0 : what are your tastes in music ? @entity28 : @entity322 is the music that i know deepest and love the most , and i mean jazz across the board because that 's an incredibly diverse art , and also i must say , r&b , funk and soul speak very powerfully to me			2
@entity0 : favorite artists ? @entity28 : @entity331 is quite a favorite artist			2
@entity332 , @entity333 , and also the breadth and accomplishment over a career of @entity337			0
@entity0 : and @entity6 ? @entity28 : can you imagine ? i get to hear her at close range			2
boy , that 's going to be my gift for the year .			0

@entity19 will be fourth poet to read at an inauguration
@entity28 : poetry can provide a fresh way of looking at problems
she says poetry is quirky and no one can predict how people will react to it
