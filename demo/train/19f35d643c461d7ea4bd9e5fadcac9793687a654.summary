@entity0 -- they say you always remember your first			0
that 's why , as election results pour in tuesday night , @entity5 will be ready with a fully - charged cell phone and a spreadsheet loaded with names and numbers of @entity12 candidates to call as soon as their victories -- or defeats -- are announced			1
" we 'll be hitting the phones , " @entity5 told @entity1			1
" i 'm one of the folks who calls either way			2
sometimes it 's more important to call the folks who did n't win than it is the folks who did because the folks who did get a lot of calls and the folks who did n't do n't get many			1
" for the possible 2016 hopefuls , election night calls are about much more than who controls the @entity31			2
this is an early â € ” and important â € ” opportunity to build relationships with candidates at all levels of politics who might come in handy should they decide to campaign for the @entity38			1
beyond just being a kind gesture , election night calls are an opportunity to subtly remind candidates -- especially those in early - voting states such as @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 -- of their support			1
in @entity5 's case , his effort wo n't stop with top - of - the - ballot governors or congressional races , either			1
his aides plan to monitor state and local races online throughout @entity44 , such the @entity57 and @entity58 elections , so he can be one of the first to be in touch			2
@entity61 sen. @entity60 , one of the most dogged campaign travelers this cycle , will spend tuesday night at an event in @entity65 for @entity31 minority leader @entity66 and other statewide candidates			2
@entity68 , a @entity60 adviser , will be at his side and will have cell phone numbers ready to dial			2
" we will call a bunch but will also probably end up talking to more over the subsequent days when they have time to take a breath , " @entity68 told @entity1			2
" it has been my experience the most difficult time to reach anyone is on their election night			0
" @entity81 gov. @entity80 plans to be in his home state on @entity83 with the numbers handy for every @entity61 gubernatorial candidate on the ballot this year			1
he 's kept an ambitious campaigning and fundraising schedule this year in his role as the chairman of the @entity91			0
for their part , representatives for @entity95 presidential hopefuls @entity93 and @entity96 would n't detail their election night plans , although both have invested time on the trail campaigning for their party candidates			0
other prominent @entity12 will stay busy even if they 're not going to such great lengths as @entity5 's phone call spreadsheet			1
@entity106 rep. @entity105 , the @entity61 's 2012 vice presidential candidate , will keep tabs on the election results with local candidates and supporters in @entity111			0
@entity113 gov. @entity112 will spend the night in @entity114			0
meanwhile , in @entity116 , there will be plenty of 2016 intrigue at a gathering to celebrate @entity120 's expected win in the governor 's race			0
that party , at the @entity124 in @entity125 , will attract three possible 2016 @entity38 contenders @entity127 , @entity128 and former @entity130 gov. @entity129 under one roof			0
the election night phone call tradition , of course , is just a small part of the effort that goes into fostering goodwill for presidential contenders			1
many potential 2016ers , including @entity60 , @entity5 , @entity112 , @entity116 gov. @entity128 and @entity116 sen. @entity127 , have logged tens of thousands of miles supporting candidates this election cycle			1
those efforts kicked into hyper - drive in final days of campaign season			0
@entity80 , for instance , stumped in 15 states in the last week of the race			0
over the weekend , @entity5 traveled to @entity148 , @entity116 , @entity149 and @entity44 , where his advocacy organization , @entity150 , bussed in volunteers to knock on doors for candidates in the first - in - the - nation caucus state			1
@entity130 @entity61 sen. @entity155 went to to @entity44 to promote @entity31 candidate @entity156 and others			0
and @entity127 hoofed it to @entity159 to support @entity12 @entity31 candidate @entity160			0
they 're betting that it will all be worth the effort when the presidential primary season begins in earnest , a time when each contender will be making a very different round of phone callsâ € ” asking for support for their own campaigns .			1

@entity5 will call candidates across the country when their races are decided
@entity83 phone calls are an opportunity to shore up support for *future* campaigns
