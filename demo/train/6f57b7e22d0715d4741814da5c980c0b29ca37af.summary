-- @entity2 films are known for their upbeat finales , but the industry behind them also has plenty to celebrate			1
@entity9 's @entity8 film business marks its centenary this month , while a new feature toasting the nation 's cinematic heritage , @entity14 , premiered at the @entity15 last week			1
@entity9 filmmakers are in fine financial fettle too , as a boom in multiplex screens brings record audiences in to see their song - and - dance spectaculars , making last year the sector 's most successful ever by sales			2
but a management revolution is brewing in a business that dates its birth to the first screening of a silent film in @entity29 in may 1913 , and one brought about by the arrival of some of the biggest names in the global entertainment business			0
@entity36 - based studios such as @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 are attempting to win a larger share of the @entity9 film market , which is both the world 's most productive and most popular , churning out more than 1,000 films annually and selling more than 3bn tickets last year			1
money is one motivation : @entity9 film revenues are projected to increase by more than half to $ 3.6bn over the next four years , according to consultants @entity50 , helping the country surpass @entity52 as the world 's fifth - largest film market by sales			1
openness to outsiders is equally as important , however , especially to international participants seeking growth across the developing world			0
" which of the large emerging film markets is as free of regulation as @entity9 ? here there are no restrictions			2
anyone can come and make what they want , " says @entity66 , the head of @entity67 , @entity9 's largest film producer by revenue			2
" the only other potentially really large market , @entity73 , is full of limits on how many films foreign groups can make and distribute			0
" @entity37 is the most prominent of the new foreign arrivals , following its acquisition last year of @entity67 , a large @entity9 film and television group , in a deal worth $ 454m			1
@entity38 may follow suit as industry observers expect the @entity36 conglomerate to buy out the remainder of its 50 - 50 joint venture with @entity86 , an @entity9 media company			1
@entity88 's @entity87 is increasingly prominent , with its @entity90 division building on the success of the company 's larger and more established @entity93 cable television business			0
@entity96 's biggest names have nonetheless had to grapple with an unusual challenge as they attempt to crack the @entity9 market , says @entity99 , head of media entertainment at @entity50 in @entity29 , namely the unusual reluctance of local film - goers to warm to their main product			1
@entity9 has proved almost uniquely resistant to imported @entity105 - language films , with foreign efforts taking only 9 per cent of the country 's box office last year compared to about half of the market in @entity73			2
consequently only a few dozen english - language films are released each year , as @entity9 's public show a clear preference for films in @entity8 , alongside those produced in more than a dozen other local languages			0
in response , the foreign participants have adopted an unusual approach : setting themselves up as domestic film studios , which attempt to beat @entity2 at its own game by producing @entity9 - language films , overseen with minimal interference from their parent groups in @entity126			1
" in nearly every other world market , the @entity96 studios have basically established local distribution offices to push their own @entity36 movies , " @entity50 's mr @entity99 says			1
" but @entity9 is the only place where they have been forced to go local with a vengeance			0
" these hybrid international businesses have proved commercially successful so far , says @entity135 , chief operating officer of @entity136 , while introducing a shake - up on the financial side of an industry that until recently was dominated by small , family - controlled production houses			0
alongside two domestic studios -- the film arm of industrialist @entity145 's @entity144 empire and @entity146 , a film producer traded on @entity148 , @entity150 's junior stock market -- the big @entity36 studios account for the majority of funding for @entity9 films too			1
" in a very short span of time , the financing architecture of the industry has changed completely , " says mr @entity135 , who estimates that roughly three - quarters of film funding in @entity9 is controlled by larger corporate groups , up from about a tenth only 10 years ago			1
such companies still face challenges as they aim for future growth			0
domestic ticket prices remain among the world 's lowest , for instance , while @entity9 , despite the opening of new multiplex cinemas , still has far fewer screens per capita than most other big markets			0
even hit @entity2 films rarely earn more than @entity174 ( $ 18.5m ) , a fraction of their @entity96 equivalent			2
the industry is also yet to crack the global export market : its products are popular with @entity9 's sizeable diaspora , but there is little sign of a long - hoped - for " crossover " @entity2 hit capable of winning over a wider international audience			1
nonetheless , the scale of the change brought by the arrival of international groups is clear			0
" for 95 out of the 100 years of @entity2 there were no corporations at all			2
it was one big family business , based on handshakes and hugs , often with quite dubious sources of finance , " says the head of one large @entity9 entertainment group , speaking on condition of anonymity			0
" now you have professionals running the businesses , and professional sources of finance too			0
it has upended the entire power structure of this industry , and for the better			0
