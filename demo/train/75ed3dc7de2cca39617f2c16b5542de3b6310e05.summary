-- there 's always been something about @entity3 that makes grown men go weak at the knees , particularly members of the @entity8			1
perhaps she revives memories of stern schoolmistresses ; perhaps they just grudgingly admired a strong woman telling them what to do			0
i suspect the same will be true of @entity18 's portrayal of the former @entity20 prime minister in the new biopic , " @entity22 , " which the consensus appears to view as a pitch - perfect performance , accurately capturing the look , sound and general aura of the @entity20 's first female premier			1
for many , the movie will be a nostalgia trip , whisking viewers back to happier times when politics was politics , there were heated ideological battles and elected leaders actually believed in something			1
" @entity22 " plays on all of those things , although without explicitly taking sides			2
there 's no real attempt to analyze whether she was right or wrong during any highlighted episode			0
so we witness mrs @entity3 taking on striking miners in the mid- 1980s , taking on the @entity45 to recover the @entity46 early in her premiership , and -- the most consistent theme of all -- taking on the @entity49 to reach to top of what @entity50 called " the greasy pole " of politics in the first place			1
review : " @entity22 " biopics naturally simplify -- how else could an eventful career be crammed into just over 100 minutes of celluloid ? but the essence of the @entity3 years are certainly there and besides , the collective memory of that turbulent decade is also simplistic and broad brush			1
a nuanced analysis of @entity3 's economic record would hardly have kept the box office busy			2
that said the screenplay takes few serious liberties with historical fact			0
mrs @entity3 's political love - in with the then @entity71 president @entity70 is covered , albeit briefly , as is her attempted assassination by the @entity73 in 1984			2
the leadership crisis that ended her premiership in 1990 also features , as one might expect in a biopic			0
@entity3 , of course , remains a deeply divisive figure in the @entity20 -- not least in parts of northern @entity80 and @entity81 -- so movie audiences , like the country at large , will be divided			1
@entity85 fans will glean reassuring glimpses of what made her great in their eyes , while those who remember her less fondly will no doubt come away with their prejudices safely intact			0
gallery : " @entity22 " and other political biopics but for the generation or so of moviegoers who have no direct memory of the events covered in the film , their perception of @entity3 -- her legacy and beliefs -- will undoubtedly be highly informed by " @entity22			1
" although not really " political " in that it offers few judgments , @entity18 's performance is nevertheless useful historical propaganda for a @entity8 grappling with many of the same issues today			1
more interesting will be the reaction to the depiction of @entity3 's dementia , first ( publicly ) revealed by her daughter @entity112 a few years ago			2
although it has often been mentioned in the press , few in the @entity20 are directly aware of its extent and will probably be shocked at @entity18 's nuanced portrait of the @entity22 displaying more than a little mental rust			0
it 's almost a taboo subject , looking back on mrs @entity3 's political career through the eyes of an obviously frail old lady			2
how would an @entity71 audience have reacted to such a portrayal of @entity70 in his dotage ? i suspect not at all well			0
political activists prefer to remember their heroes -- and heroines -- in their prime			0
older members of the @entity8 often indulge in the wistful refrain : " if only @entity85 was still leader of the party			0
" they do so because they find the thought comforting , secure in the knowledge that with a click of her heel and a firm handbagging she would sort out all the old enemies			0
in that respect , " @entity22 " will probably bring tears to some veteran @entity8 eyes .			1

@entity145 : @entity3 biopic " @entity22 " a nostalgia trip
the movie shows @entity3 as pm in the 1980s , and as a frail elderly woman , suffering from dementia
@entity145 : 1980s were a time " when politics was politics and elected leaders actually believed in something "
he says " @entity22 " may prove " useful propaganda " for the @entity8
