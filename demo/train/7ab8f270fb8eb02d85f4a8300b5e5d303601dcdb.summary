-- when president @entity1 said recently that " we do n't have a strategy yet " to defeat the @entity4 -- also known as @entity5 or @entity5 -- many people were scandalized			1
columnists attacked him for what they said was his admission of a deep failure			2
his own staff had to run around defending and explaining what he said			2
it was seen as a terrible blunder			2
or maybe it was n't			1
the truth is that 13 years after the september 11 attacks , the @entity18 does not have an effective strategy for dealing with radical islamists and their deep commitment to waging war against us and against our civilization			1
much like the man who has a hammer and therefore assumes every problem is a nail , our bureaucracies have tried for 13 years to redefine the problem into something they are comfortable dealing with			1
two long , bitter wars -- @entity36 is now the longest war in @entity18 history , four years longer than the @entity39 and almost three times the length of @entity18 participation in @entity42 -- have not made @entity18 and its allies safer			1
the emergence of the @entity4 , as the terror group calls itself , is a further reminder that the analysis and predictions of the intelligence community , the military and the @entity48 have often been just plain wrong			2
@entity4 controls vast regions in two countries and has substantial military equipment			0
it is not just a new problem in nation - state relations			0
@entity58 to engage it inside @entity60 or @entity61 is not the key question			0
instead , the most important aspect about @entity4 is that it is a vector for attracting , training and preparing foreign terrorists from all over the world			0
@entity4 comprises 10,000 potential terrorists from more than 50 countries			0
estimates vary widely on how many @entity18 have gone @entity61 to join @entity5 and other extremist groups			1
some officials say dozens have gone ; @entity74 chairman @entity73 says " hundreds			0
" at least one of them , from @entity77 , was recently killed			0
why it took @entity1 so long to address his no @entity5 strategy comments more than 500 potential terrorists are believed to have traveled from @entity82 to join @entity5			1
it 's believed that the two @entity18 journalists were beheaded by the same man , and experts believe he is from @entity87			1
@entity89 prime minister @entity88 has begun to recognize the depth and power of the terrorism crisis			0
he is proposing a series of major legal changes in @entity82 to eliminate would - be terrorists from @entity89 life			0
there will be even more draconian laws proposed in the near future if this conflict escalates			0
we are facing a new kind of crisis in the rise of radical islamists who spread their ideology worldwide through the @entity107 and through human networking			0
it is a global phenomenon and the analytical models and strategic patterns that have worked with nation - states will simply fail when applied to the @entity4 and its fellow terrorists in @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity117 militants , @entity119 jihadis or any other group			0
we need a new analysis with new language and new strategies that relate to defeating a viral system that spreads across national boundaries			1
we 're better off with a president who does n't have a good strategy and knows he does n't than with a president who has a bad strategy but thinks he has a good one			1
for most of his administration , the president was firmly in the latter category , so his recent epiphany marks an improvement			2
if there is a silver lining in president @entity1 's disastrous foreign policy , it has been in awakening @entity18 and perhaps even the president himself to the need for a profound rethinking of our approach to radical @entity147 .			1

*critics* *pounced* when president @entity1 said " we do n't have a strategy yet " to defeat @entity5
@entity152 : but it 's true -- 13 years after 9/11 , we do n't have strategy for defeating extremists
@entity158 : we need a new strategy toward a whole new *breed* of extremists
he says it 's better if you have no good strategy and know it than to implement a bad one
