@entity0 -- @entity4 tuesday blamed its neighbors for escalating tensions in the @entity8 , one day after the @entity3 navy held a live - fire drill in disputed waters			1

" " although the @entity62 claimed neutrality on the issue , if conflicts arise in the area , they may use it as an excuse to intervene , " he added			0

" @entity4 is trying to safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests , not infringing on other countries ' rights , " he added			2
" justice lies in the heart of the people			0
