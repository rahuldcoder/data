@entity0 , @entity1 -- the training pitch is a dusty patch of ground used by the local police force as a car park , and the club house is located in a former women 's prison that held @entity10 captive during the apartheid era			1
two of the team 's players have been victims of " corrective " rapes -- @entity16 , this is not			1
the facilities of the @entity0 - based " @entity20 " lesbian football club could not be further from those of the glamorous teams that play in the @entity23 , but the first such tournament to be held in @entity1 has proved inspirational to the members of this local squad			1
@entity28 used to play defense for her side , but after @entity1 's " @entity32 " national team kicked off the opening game of soccer 's biggest event at the city 's new 90,000 - seater arena a few miles away , she has turned her focus to netting goals			1
" i watched many , many @entity41 games			1
i 'm really enjoying it [ and now ] i want to be like @entity42 [ the scorer of @entity1 's sensational opening goal of the event ] , " she told @entity2			1
" the way he ran through the ball and struck the shot ... i want to be like him , i want those skills -- i love that goal so much ! " i asked that my team try me in the striking force in the last game we played , and i scored ! i was so happy			1
my teammate crossed the ball , i trapped it and took a shot and that was my goal			2
i shouted : " i scored ! " it encouraged me to be a striker because now i want more goals			2
" @entity66 , @entity1 's only openly gay female football team , was created in 2004 by the @entity67 ( @entity68 ) to fill a void for many of the passionate , soccer - loving women who attended their sessions but who had been expelled from their township teams because of their sexuality			1
can soccer heal a scarred society ? from their base in what was the notorious @entity81 -- a jail that incarcerated @entity83 , @entity84 , as well as @entity85 and @entity10 before it was converted for other uses -- the group is hoping to use sport as a tool to address the issues of homophobia by playing other women 's sides in the area			1
@entity66 's coach @entity94 , 27 , told @entity2 that soccer had helped to give her strength			2
" i love football , it is the only thing that kept me going when i was being hurt by what was happening at home and in my community			0
soccer is my life , " she said			0
organizers hope that the all - lesbian team offers a safe haven for the players who previously suffered discrimination for being openly gay -- the worst manifestation of this being the " corrective rape " of two of the squad members			1
@entity113 , program coordinator of @entity68 , said that @entity1 society had not always proved an easy place to live for those involved with the team			1
" one of our players , @entity121 , was attacked in her township			2
she was out with her friends and these boys followed her			0
they beat her up until she was unconscious and then they raped her , " @entity113 said			0
from death row to defense : soccer behind bars " this happened in 2009 but the police have still been unable to find the guy			0
we 're hoping they will keep pursuing the case as she stills lives in fear it will happen again			0
" @entity94 added : " they want to correct us , to show us what a man can do			0
they think that being a lesbian is immoral and uncultured			0
the corrective rapes are getting higher every day			0
" @entity146 , the 23 - year - old captain of the side , said she had been affected by what had happened to her teammate			0
" i do n't walk at night now and i do n't party unless it is a gay night			2
i walk hand - in - hand with my girlfriend , but we get called names			0
i just try to ignore them , " she said			0
history of the vuvuzela : battle of the horn though the past of the players -- who warm up by singing protests songs as they walk to training every tuesday and thursday -- may be troubled , the coming of the @entity41 to @entity1 means they have their thoughts firmly focused on the future			1
" we played in a tournament recently where we lost in the final 3 - 2			2
but after watching the @entity41 i wish my team would play like @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 because they play as a collective , not as individuals , " @entity169 said			1
@entity94 added : " we are going to @entity171 to play in the @entity176 in july			0
in 2006 and 2008 we won bronze medals but in 2010 we will win gold			0
@entity32 may not win the @entity41 but we will win ours ! "			2

@entity1 's only openly gay female team formed by women expelled from township sides
" @entity20 " club based in what was formerly a notorious @entity0 prison
its players say they have been inspired by the @entity41 being played in @entity1
organizers hope the team offers a safe haven for players who have suffered discrimination
