@entity0 , @entity1 -- every day , the workers in the @entity0 kitchen cook three squares for the detainees held here			1
and every day , up to 100 of the 166 inmates send them back			2
they 're protesting their ongoing imprisonment by going on hunger strikes for what is now 100 days			1
not only has @entity0 become a lightning rod for @entity14 's critics -- it 's no prize for @entity14 's taxpayers , either			1
running the prison camp costs the @entity18 more than $ 150 million a year -- just over $ 900,000 for each of the 166 detainees at the facility , located on a @entity23 base on the eastern end of @entity1			1
by comparison , costs for a typical federal prison inmate run about $ 25,000 a year ; at the " supermax " prison in @entity30 that holds domestic terrorists @entity32 and @entity33 , it 's about $ 60,000			1
and despite calls by president @entity37 himself to close the 11 - year - old facility , the military is about to spend millions more to upgrade the prison camp			2
" we have to always plan to conduct that mission from now into the future , " said @entity42 col. @entity41 , commander of the military 's @entity43 at @entity0			1
" and the policymakers will decide when that mission 's over			2
" @entity50 life at @entity0 : hunger strikes , sprays of filth the renovation plans include a $ 50 million overhaul for @entity56 , the most secretive part of the compound			1
the inmates there include @entity61 , the self - professed organizer of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity63 and @entity64 ; accused co-conspirators @entity65 and @entity67 ; and @entity68 , the man accused of leading the plot to bomb the destroyer @entity71 in @entity72 , killing 17 @entity14 sailors			0
they face trial on war crimes charges before the military courts set up to try @entity78 and @entity79 figures			0
most of the rest of the prisoners face no charges at all			0
because the facilities were hastily built and never thought to be permanent , the prison camp may need as much as $ 170 million more in repairs , said @entity87 gen. @entity87 , the chief of @entity14 forces in the region			1
" this is really a kind of thrown - together operation , " @entity87 told the @entity90 in march			2
" it 's really not 11 years long			2
it 's really one year , 11 times			2
" the kitchens are " literally falling apart , " @entity87 said , and the barracks that house the 1,900 troops assigned to the prison camp need replacing			1
and since everything has to be brought in from outside , it all costs about twice as much , he said			0
guantanamo at a boiling point the decrepit remains of previous units -- the original @entity106 , where detainees were first housed in chain - link cages , and the successive @entity109 -- still stand on the way to the infirmary			0
weeds grow up among the rusted gates , empty watchtowers and abandoned exercise equipment , all within a mile of the facilities where the remaining prisoners are held			0
a total of 86 of the 166 detainees have been approved for transfer out , but both the @entity37 administration and @entity122 have effectively halted the moves			0
the last transfer took place in september , and the @entity127 office tasked with finding countries that would take the others was closed in january			0
and the indefinite imprisonment the detainees face has fueled the wave of hunger strikes , which have progressed to the point where about 30 inmates are being force - fed. " it 's kind of a tough mission , " the camp 's senior medical officer , who was interviewed on condition of anonymity for security reasons , told @entity2			1
" this is kind of an ugly place sometimes			1
" the battle to force feed @entity147 detainees the inmates are given a last chance to drink a nutritional supplement before being force - fed. if they refuse , they 're strapped to a chair and a plastic tube is shoved up their noses , down their throats and into their stomachs			0
the @entity18 says the feeding program is lawful and humane			0
the inmates are given a numbing gel and the thin tubes are lubricated before being inserted , they say			0
" nobody 's expressed to me that this hurts , " the senior medical officer said			1
but @entity166 , a lawyer for hunger striker @entity167 , called it " an incredibly agonizing process			0
" " you do n't get farther than about here , into your throat , before the tears start streaming down your face			0
... he said he had never felt so much pain like that in his life , " she said			0
photo : inside look at @entity0 the practice has been condemned by human rights groups and the @entity183 , which says every patient has the right to refuse even life - sustaining treatment			1
but the senior medical officer said that when a prisoner is on the verge of harming himself , " suddenly it 's not a very abstract decision			1
" " it 's very easy for folks outside this place to make policies and decisions that they think they would implement , " he said			1
" there 's a lot of politics involved " in the @entity183 's opposition he added , " and i 'm sure there 's lots of politics that they need to answer to as well			0
" @entity2 @entity18 correspondent @entity206 reported from @entity0			2
@entity207 reported and wrote from @entity208 .			0

*friday* marks 100 days of hunger strikes at @entity0
it costs $ 900,000 per detainee to run the camp , and it 's " falling apart "
" this is kind of an ugly place sometimes , " its chief medical officer says
