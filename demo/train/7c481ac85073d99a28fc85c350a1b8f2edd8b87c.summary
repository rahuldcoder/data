-- the steady hum of sewing machines fills the air inside a large glovemaking factory on the outskirts of @entity6 , the bustling @entity7 capital			1
patches of leather move through an array of working stations as busy laborers work feverishly to meet the company 's export quota : 5,000 gloves a day			1
the operation belongs to @entity17 , a @entity18 - based company whose trading partnership with @entity7 dates back to the early 1900s			1
here , hardy , durable cow hide is made into work gloves			2
these are ideal for builders and gardeners , and are mainly exported to the @entity26 and then there are the stylish designs -- created from a different type of animal skin , these are made to keep fingers warm in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			2
" the fashion glove is made of sheep skin which is unique to @entity7 , " explains @entity36 , general manager at @entity37			1
" the durability , the stretch ability and the strength makes it popular for gloving leather specifically			0
that has been the one strength of @entity7 and the leather sector			1
" sophisticated designs with decorative touches may be the hallmark of this type of glove , but they must also be practical			0
@entity7 's climate makes this animal skin effective at withstanding the winter chill -- an essential selling point			1
and this effective material is in abundant supply			0
@entity7 's 90 - million cattle , sheep and goat population is one of the world 's largest , according to the @entity64			1
creative process what slips onto the customer 's hand may be elegant , but the process to create the glove certainly is not			0
it all starts in the tannery where workers -- dressed in aprons and thick , elbow - high protective gloves -- convert the raw animal hides and skins into finished leather through a number of processes			2
some of the steps include soaking the skin and fleshing it to remove any unwanted parts			0
a retanning process where the leather is colored is followed by a stage under a special vacuum dryer where the skin is dried and then stretched to increase its surface area			0
once all this has happened , another machine softens the leather to make it flexible -- an important feature of gloves			0
the end product , ready for export , is pure sheep skin prepared to be turned into gloves -- labeled with the thickness and the area it covers			1
export ban in a move to encourage value addition and increase revenues generated by the leather sector , the @entity7 government banned all exports of raw hides and skins in 1989			2
between 2006 and 2012 , the total value of @entity7 's exports of leather and leather products grew from $ 66 million to $ 112 million			1
and it 's not just @entity116 that have realized the opportunity to make gloves in @entity7			1
according to the @entity122 , two other factories in the country are focused on creating the hand garments			0
shoes is another major area which uses @entity7 leather			2
the country is home to dozens of shoemaking companies , including local names such as @entity131 and international players like the @entity133 , a @entity134 company that has been exporting some 20,000 pairs of shoes a month since it launched its manufacturing facility outside @entity6 in 2012			0
business conditions despite a major focus to rapidly build its energy and transport infrastructure , @entity7 is still struggling to provide the best conditions for businesses setting up shop in the country			2
" the challenges that we encountered when we started business are from power cuts to logistics to foreign currency availability , to lead time in having available raw materials , " explains @entity36			0
" having the solutions to these challenges would allow us to be competitive as a country and as a company as a whole			0
" beyond these issues , international manufactures also struggle to recruit workers			0
@entity7 's population is growing at a rate of 2.89 % , placing it among the top 15 fastest growing populations in the world , according to the @entity166			1
but a large workforce and a skilled work force is not the same thing			0
in fact , @entity36 says " bridging the gap between the rest of the world and the skills set in @entity7 on the ground has been the greatest challenge so far			1
" another growth area , is the number of @entity7 entering the middle class and showing a desire to buy high quality clothes			2
in a report published this month , the @entity182 said the country is on track to achieve its goal of reaching middle income status by 2025			0
the trend is so clear to @entity189 that they are now targeting consumers inside the country			0
but for @entity7 , it 's not just the top quality of the leather products that makes them take out their wallets , it 's also access to a label they can call their own : made in @entity7			1
