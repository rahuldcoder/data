-- smarting from their first back - to - back defeats in nearly three years , @entity1 are on the defensive for a change as they approach tuesday 's @entity6 semifinal second leg against @entity7			1
@entity1 all but surrendered the @entity9 league title with saturday 's 2 - 1 home loss to @entity11 that came days after a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity13 in the first leg			1
@entity1 defender @entity15 strongly rejected any suggestion that his club might be in the midst of a more deep - seated crisis , and that the losses could signal the beginning of the end of a glittering era			1
" a team that has won 13 trophies in three and a half years deserves more credit than that , " he said			2
" other teams need to win more championships before we start talking like that			0
" coach @entity33 was equally bullish in his news conference before the match , even swearing as he defended his decision to play the inexperienced @entity37 against @entity11			1
@entity33 has seen his side dominate possession against both @entity7 and @entity11 yet struggle to find a way to goal , with @entity42 failing to add to his 63 goals for the season			1
" i do n't know if this is the most important moment of my career as a coach , " @entity33 said of the @entity7 game			1
" but i have always faced these challenges with a lot of optimism as i believe in my players and team			0
" @entity11 now lead the @entity9 league by seven points with four games remaining , with midfielder @entity57 conceding that a fourth straight title " is practically impossible			0
" but @entity1 could still end the season as winners of the @entity6 and @entity61			1
the @entity62 have already won the @entity63 , the @entity64 and the @entity65			0
" we 'll keep fighting , because we know that it 's still in our own hands to have a good season , " @entity57 said on @entity1 's official website			1
@entity7 have n't lost in six meetings with @entity1 and won the home leg thanks to a determined defensive display and a @entity75 goal just before half time			1
@entity33 has the option of restoring @entity15 to his starting lineup to combat @entity75 's strength , having sprung a surprise by leaving the @entity80 international out of both the first leg and the game against @entity11			1
@entity15 said he is n't taking it personally			2
" for me , the important issue is n't whether i play tomorrow , " he said			0
" for me , the main thing is that we win and reach the final			0
" it is a new situation for me because i 'm used to playing and in the last matches i have not had a chance to play			0
but it 's a technical decision of the manager and i have to respect that			0
" @entity1 go into tuesday 's match having won their last 15 home matches in the @entity6			1
@entity7 , meanwhile , have only won once on the road in @entity98 this season			2
but @entity7 have found a unity under interim coach @entity101 that seemed to be lacking under previous manager @entity102 , and they are unbeaten in 13 of 14 matches since the @entity105 took charge			1
" his message is clearly aimed at team spirit -- fighting , " @entity7 striker @entity107 told the @entity98 website			2
" you have to fight and then your talent will come through afterwards			0
when all of that comes together , you 'll overcome your opponent most of the time			0
" that was never more evident than in @entity7 's first leg performance			1
@entity1 had 72 % of the possession and six shots on target			2
@entity7 had one -- @entity75 's goal			2
" many teams who play @entity1 think that you have to steal the ball from them , but i do n't think that 's possible , " @entity107 said			2
" you have to use different weapons against them			0
if you want to steal the ball , you wo n't manage it and you 'll get tired , and then create more space for your opponent			0
" @entity1 's last @entity6 exit in 2010 came in the semifinal at the hands of @entity141 's @entity140 side , which won the first leg 3 - 1 before producing an ultra-defensive display at the @entity144 to win 3 - 2 on aggregate			1
but @entity146 said he wo n't send his side out to play for a goalless draw			0
" the tie is half time , it 's 50 - 50			2
both teams still have the same chance to go through , " he said			0
" i do think we will have to try to score			0

@entity1 head into @entity6 semifinal second leg against @entity7 *trailing* 1 - 0
@entity33 's team have lost back - to - back matches for the first time since may 2009
@entity1 could recall defender @entity15 for tuesday 's game
