-- @entity1 had had the difficult conversation with her husband -- a few times in fact			1
the quadriplegic had finally made the decision to end her life , had prepared to say goodbyes to @entity10 and the rest of her family			1
" it got to a point where i evaluated my life , " @entity14 told @entity0			1
" i had to decide whether the space that i take up on the sofa [ which unable to move she had done for hours and days on end ] was still worth inhabiting			2
" i came to the conclusion it was n't			2
i was at a very , very low point			2
" i knew if and when my condition got any worse i would end my life			1
that was a decision myself and my husband were both aware of			2
you do n't make that decision on your own , you have to prepare yourself			2
" it was to be a pre-ordained death with rules			2
" basically , i would n't allow myself to take my tablets any more if i got much worse or got depressed or whatever , " @entity14 added			2
" but i also set parameters to make sure that it was n't a spur of the moment thing			2
i have wonderful friends and family , who made sure they did everything to make sure my life was worth living			1
" for all their collective positivity , though , nothing worked , until a friend lured @entity14 to an outing on the water at @entity47 , her local club in southern @entity48			0
" it would n't overstate it to say that sailing saved my life , " said @entity14			1
" it just gave me a little glimmer of thinking that space i was taking up on the sofa was worth inhabiting after all , particularly as someone had managed to get me off it to get on the water			0
" it was like ' gosh , i 've found a reason to live			1
' " that was 11 years ago			0
since that damascene conversion she has sailed single handed across the @entity65 , circumnavigated @entity66 and most recently sailed the 1,500 kilometers across the @entity67 from @entity68 to @entity69 , her first proper offshore expedition			0
it made her the first paralyzed women to complete the voyage while also on board was @entity77 yachtswoman @entity76 , the first @entity78 woman to complete the trip			1
muscle waiting disease @entity14 suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy , a muscle wasting disease caused by a genetic blip that now prevents her from using her arms and legs			1
with her sole movement in her head , @entity14 's boat for that voyage -- a 28 - ft dragonfly trimaran -- was rigged up for her to sail it using innovative methods originally designed in the @entity96			1
" i have three straws with which you register positive or negative pressure - so puff or suck , " she explains			1
" that turns the winch one way or the other			0
the magic thing on the latest trip is that i was able to turn port and starboard in opposite directions at the same time thanks to reversible winches and thus fully tack the boat rather than doing it slowly , slowly bit by bit			0
" the 41 - year - old has n't always lacked mobility and it was n't until the age of 11 that she noticed there might be something awry			0
" i came off the hockey pitch with really sore knees , " she recalls			0
" i thought it was growing pains and would go away			0
by 13 , it was hurting walking up and down stairs but again i thought it would go away			0
by the age of 17 , she had lost the use of her legs , though she refused to give up on her ambition to become a biochemist -- an ambition she says she had from the age of three , which she achieved with a university degree followed by a phd			0
working in a lab on her phd she had to concentrate on not dropping things			0
one day , though , three months of work and Â£ 12,000 worth of samples slipped out of her hands			0
she never returned to the lab and a complex operation , which involved blood drained from her arms with an injection to stun painful nerve ends , did not work			0
" life is n't always straightforward , " reflects @entity14			1
" you just have to be grateful for what you have when you have it			0
" for her , that is out on the water			0
" it 's such a liberating place , it 's where you feel free			1
once on the boat i can sail it as well as anyone really			0
i can forget about work or home life , anything in fact			1
" you just think about the next wave and the next puff of wind coming			0
the wheelchair 's not there , i 'm a sailor and it 's a huge feeling of freedom			1
" but it 's more than that			1
it 's there that the pain dissipates			1
it does n't entirely go away , when you smack a wave , wow , i feel it			0
but it 's like an itch , if there 's something else , you forget about it			1
" despite her lack of movement , @entity14 still suffers from crippling pain thought to be caused by one particular fully functioning problematic nerve that sends a feeling of immense pain , heat or cold coursing through her veins			1
it 's something that has to be treated with a daily diet of opiates and morphine , though the pain never properly vanishes			1
it does not , however , stop her from planning new expeditions			0
there is one dream trip for @entity14 , who is sponsored by @entity204 , that hangs above all others			1
" i want a longer crossing and i 'm looking at something for next year			0
" the dream would be to sail across the @entity209 -- it 's something i 've been thinking about and looking into for a long time			1
but we 're quite a way off from getting to that point			0
" people talk about the dangers but i have a safety boat with me in case i capsize			0
there are dangers certainly but it 's about risk management			2
there are more people hurt riding horses each year than sailing			2
" it is such dreams that give @entity14 hope as she sits back on her sofa thinking of a myriad of oceans still to explore .			2

@entity1 had decided to take her own life back in 2003 but then took up sailing
the quadriplegic 's passion for the high seas has , she says , given her a reason to live
able *bodied* in her youth , her degenerative disease has seen her lose movement
she sails using straws and her dream voyage is to travel solo across the @entity209
