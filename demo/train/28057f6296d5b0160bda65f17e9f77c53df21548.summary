-- @entity2 driver @entity1 has slammed @entity4 's rules on car testing , describing the regulations as like asking footballers to train with tennis balls or tennis stars to play with bats			1
the two - time world champion questioned the wisdom of the current rules , which allows one three - day in - season test in addition to a number of officially sanctioned pre-season tests			1
the @entity18 , who won the drivers ' championship in 2005 and 2006 , said there was only so much a team could learn from using computer simulators , explaining that some drivers look elsewhere in a bid for much - needed practice			1
" how much a new technical component can deliver in terms of performance remains a question mark after being tried out only on the simulator , " the 30 - year - old told a press conference at @entity2 's annual @entity30 media event			1
" @entity4 is one of the very few sports in which training is forbidden ... it 's like telling @entity40 to train with a little tennis ball or @entity42 to play with a ping - pong bat ... we go karting because we have no alternative			1
" the restrictions on testing mean some drivers turn to other motorsport disciplines , with @entity52 's @entity51 suffering compound fractures to his right elbow , shoulder and leg in a rallying accident last february			1
@entity51 missed the whole of the 2011 season due to the crash and suffered a further setback on wednesday when it was announced that he had broken his right leg during a fall at his home in @entity65			1
the 27 - year - old had already ruled out a comeback in time for the start of the 2012 world championship , with his former team @entity70 , now known as @entity71 , recruiting an all - new driver line - up of 2007 world champion @entity73 and @entity75 @entity74			0
but the recently renamed marque 's principal , @entity76 , took the time to praise @entity51 's courage and wish him a speedy recovery			2
" @entity51 has shown fantastic courage and determination in his rehabilitation following the accident last year , " @entity76 told the team 's official website			2
" it is sad to hear that he has suffered this setback			0
on behalf of everyone at @entity70 , i would like to wish @entity51 a quick recovery			2
" before news of @entity51 's latest injury emerged , @entity2 team principal @entity92 had been discussing the possibility of the former @entity97 driver joining the @entity65 outfit as a replacement for @entity101 @entity100			1
the future of @entity100 , who joined @entity2 in 2006 , has been the subject of widespread speculation after a disappointing 2011 season saw him finish sixth in the drivers ' standings			2
@entity92 described @entity51 as a great driver , but stopped short of confirming or denying @entity2 's interest in him			1
" @entity51 is a great driver , but he had very severe injuries and he is still working hard just to get back to normal living , " he said			0
" we need to wait and see			0
that kind of injury takes a long time to recover from			0
" the 2012 @entity4 season will begin on march 18 with the @entity119 @entity118 in @entity120			2
meanwhile , thursday 's 11th stage of the @entity122 saw both overall leaders consolidate their advantages with victories in the 478km leg from @entity127 in @entity128 to @entity129 in @entity130			0
@entity75 @entity131 finished three minutes 44 seconds ahead of @entity132 of @entity133 in the car section and now leads his fellow - mini driver by 22 minutes and 49 seconds			0
@entity138 @entity137 's challenge finally ended , as more problems with his @entity140 meant he limped home nearly two hours behind to slip to fourth place overall and completely out of contention barring a miracle			0
another @entity75 , @entity145 , extended his lead to 2:22 over fellow - @entity148 rider and defending champion @entity149 in the motorcycle section , after his fourth stage victory			0
@entity152 came home 1:39 ahead of @entity153 , with @entity149 back in third place , although the gap is still comparatively small with three stages still remaining .			0
