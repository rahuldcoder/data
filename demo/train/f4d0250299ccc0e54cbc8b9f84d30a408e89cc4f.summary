-- what does it feel like to kill a man ? @entity4 of @entity5 , @entity6 , knew			1
he fought in @entity7 in @entity8 and he killed a @entity10 soldier during a battle in @entity12			2
he described how it felt in a poem			2
i shot a man yesterday and much to my surprise , the strangest thing happened to me i began to cry			0
so begins " murder : most foul , " a work that echoes poetry about war in the tradition of @entity24 and borrows its title from the bard 's " @entity26			0
" as powerful as the poem is , the story behind it is also fascinating			0
sgt. @entity4 returned home after the war , got married , had children and made a career as a salesman in the meatpacking industry			1
if he ever wrote any other poems , his son @entity36 and daughter @entity37 , who still live in @entity5 , @entity6 , do n't know of any			0
in fact , they did n't know about this poem until after their father died			1
they found it when they were going through his possessions			0
@entity36 and @entity47 found two typewritten pages , each with a copy of the poem			1
it was unsigned , but @entity36 believes the poem was written by his father and later typed up by his mother for safekeeping			1
the poem describes a killing in @entity12 , where @entity4 served in the @entity58 as it battled @entity10 units			1
it portrays a soldier very upset about taking a life			0
i knelt beside him and held his hand -- i begged his forgiveness did he understand ? but even while he describes the shooting as murder , @entity4 makes clear he had no choice			1
it was the @entity8 and he was the enemy if i had n't shot him he would have shot me			0
@entity71 said the poem is a bit unlike the father he grew up with -- a man who could be a " tough customer " if need be , not someone tormented by a fleeting , albeit intense , moment on a battlefield in @entity12			1
" i 'm just starting to appreciate how much he suffered only now in this part of my life			0
when i was a kid , like if he yelled at me or something , i 'd say ' well , @entity82 's being cranky , ' " @entity4 said			2
@entity4 said even though the incident in the poem took place more than 60 years ago , it still resonates and should be a lesson to young soldiers coming home from @entity90 and @entity91 that they are n't the first to face such emotional turmoil as this			1
" that feeling they may have of regret and pain and shock of what they 've done			0
it shows they are not alone , " @entity4 said			2
while @entity4 is obviously proud of his father 's poem , @entity0 sent it to @entity107 professor @entity106 , who has published several books of poetry , including " @entity110 " published last year			1
@entity106 called the poem " accomplished			0
" in an e-mail to @entity0 , @entity106 said the poem " is good , and its truths are that of experience and some literary traditions			0
" @entity71 sounded surprised when he heard @entity106 's analysis of his father 's amateur poem			2
" i 'm very deeply touched , " @entity4 said			2
" for an expert to assess it that way and make such important comparisons i 'm amazed and quite touched			0
" the poetry professor said sgt. @entity4 's poem reminds him of a famous portion of @entity24 's play " @entity131 " from this day to the ending of the world , but we in it shall be remembered -- we few , we happy few , we band of brothers ; but @entity106 said it perhaps most closely resembles " the man he killed , " a work by @entity137 written at the start of @entity143 in that poem , @entity137 writes that the soldier and the foe he killed might have shared a drink or loaned each other money had they met somewhere other than a battlefield			1
sgt. @entity4 's poem ends not with talk of loans or drinks , but a darker scene			1
i shot a man yesterday and much to surprise a part of me died with @entity158 when @entity159 came to close his eyes .			0

sgt. @entity4 returned home after the war , got married , had children became a salesman
