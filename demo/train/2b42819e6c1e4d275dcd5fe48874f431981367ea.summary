@entity0 , @entity1 -- vote counting began here monday after largely peaceful elections in which millions of voters stood in line to choose their next president in a tightly contested general election			1
the @entity9 said some of the nation 's 30,000 polling stations would remain open late to accommodate those still in line and to make up for having opened late			1
" definitely , there is going to be some hiccups here and there , but i think , when you assess the whole , then we think the work , so far , is very good , " said @entity15 , a commisssioner of @entity1 's @entity16			1
" i think all @entity1 , it looks like they have faith in the system , in the new constitution			1
" though some people waited in the sun for more than eight hours to cast their ballots , there was " no reporting at all " of intimidation , said @entity35 , the @entity36 vice president for peace programs			2
the center , at the invitation of @entity1 authorities , placed 60 observers in all 47 counties			1
in @entity0 , some lines stretched for more than a kilometer ( 0.6 miles ) , he said			2
but the observers ' initial reports were " universally complimentary to the citizens of this nation in showing their determination to have their votes counted , " @entity35 said			2
those glitches that did occur appeared related to a new system of computer - based biometric identification of voters , he said			2
" sometimes a couple of computers would get kind of out of whack and would slow the process down , " he said			0
residents were eager to avoid a repeat of the last election , in december 2007 , when the nation plunged into ethnic violence after results were disputed			1
some 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 displaced			0
" there have been so many steps and safeguards put into the system so far to prevent that kind of cataclysmic event that we 're kind of encouraged that that is not going to happen , " said @entity35			0

when police called for backup , about 200 men ambushed them on a road , @entity87 said			1
prime minister @entity99 blamed the attack on the @entity101 , a separatist group that wants @entity84 , the second - largest city in @entity1 , and its surrounding coastal area to secede			1
@entity35 said the violence may have been unrelated to the election			1

but voting in the rest of the country was largely peaceful			1
" we want a leader who would be mindful of people who are living below the poverty line , " one enthusiastic young man told @entity2 as he waited for his turn to vote			1
" you see , the majority of @entity1 people live below the poverty line , so we want a leader who will be mindful of these people			1

he has denied the charges			0
his running mate , @entity262 , also faces @entity257 charges			0
