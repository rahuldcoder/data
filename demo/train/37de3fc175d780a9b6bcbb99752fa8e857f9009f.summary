@entity0 , @entity1 -- he 's known for his big hair and his big personality and at 81 years old , legendary boxing promoter @entity6 is still hard at work trying to turn his big dreams into reality			1
his latest endeavor : a boxing and music event in @entity13			1
" this came about by me thinking about @entity13 and feeling that @entity13 , that it should be one @entity13 , " said @entity6			1
when asked about the odds of this event actually coming together , @entity6 says , " it 's very difficult to believe , i understand that			1
" understanding @entity6 may help explain why he believes he can make this event happen			1
the hallways of the @entity23 office in @entity1 are lined with photographs of him posing with world leaders , celebrities and athletes			1
there are old boxing posters and newspaper articles framed and hanging on the walls			0
it feels more like a museum than an office building			1
for decades , @entity6 has appeared alongside boxing greats including @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 -- promoting legendary matchups that have catapulted many boxers into lifelong fame			1
boxing has always been more than a sport to @entity6 , who contemplates the photos			1
" gen. @entity50 , that was my friend , " said @entity6 , pointing to a photo signed by the former @entity48 commander , now @entity49 director			1
" i went to @entity52 with him			0
" on the other side of the room is a picture of @entity6 with a young @entity57 , who " told me that music is the ribbon that ties humanity together , " @entity6 recalled			1
" and i added to that boxing is a catalyst that brings humanity together to be tied			1
" a framed letter from former president @entity65 hangs on the wall , as does his picture with @entity65 and one with @entity68			0
" i am not a @entity69 and i am not a @entity70 , " explained @entity6			1
" i 'm a ' @entity71 ' and that means that i 'm for the @entity74 people first and the party second			2
" he is a fan of president @entity76 and believes that @entity65 paved the way for an @entity76 presidency : " @entity65 had the most diversified @entity79 in the history of the nation			0
" another photo shows @entity6 with former @entity84 gov. @entity83 , who gained fame after sending @entity87 troops to @entity88 in 1970			2
@entity83 pardoned @entity6 in 1983 for a prior manslaughter conviction			2
the boxing promoter spent four years in prison for the fatal beating of a man who @entity6 says owed him money			1
@entity6 admits this was n't the only man he killed during his early years , when he was running an illegal gambling operation on the streets of @entity99			2
he had no problem describing what happened when an intruder entered his home in 1954 : " i was shooting him and he 's shooting at me , " recalled @entity6 , " he goes downstairs and into the alley somewhere and falls dead in the alley			2
" @entity6 claimed he fired in self - defense and the case was ruled a justifiable homicide			2
for both of them , i suffered deep contrition , " said @entity6 , adding , " how do you expiate for that ? you expiate for that by helping others and that 's what my life is dedicated to			2
" that life is reflected in his hallway of photographs chronicling nearly every moment of @entity6 's rise to fame			2
another photo shows @entity6 wearing a prison number , not his , but 46664 -- the prison number of former @entity133 president @entity132			2
@entity6 said @entity132 asked him to wear the black t - shirt with the number printed across the front			2
" what i take from him , he says you can do more for world peace , " @entity6 said , recalling the day they met			2
@entity132 spoke to @entity6 about bringing people together through sports			1
that concept of sports diplomacy is what @entity6 hopes to achieve on the @entity146			1
a phone call from @entity149 's ambassador to the @entity74 interrupts our guided tour of @entity6 's hallway of photos			2
@entity6 heads back into his office , asking the ambassador the progress of the @entity13 project			1
" you took the statement both to @entity161 ambassadors ? " @entity6 asks on speakerphone			0
" i wrote a letter to @entity164 and have we heard anything back from the supreme leader ? " @entity6 explains he met with the ambassador and a @entity13 representative during a trip to @entity171 and he recently sent his proposal to @entity164			1
he has not heard back from officials in @entity13			0
cult of personality surrounds new @entity13 leader before hanging up the phone , @entity6 thanks the ambassador and says , " i will call you back because i have to move on to the rest of the world , @entity177 bless you and @entity177 bless @entity13			1
" not one to sit around and wait for things to happen , after talking to the ambassador , @entity6 leaves his office for the @entity186 in @entity0 , @entity1 , where he was promoting a fight			1
as @entity6 strolls through the casino on a monday afternoon , guests instantly recognize the figure with the wild hair and @entity74 flag tie , jacket , scarf and necklace charm			0
in case the red , white and blue apparel was not enough to show his patriotism , @entity6 carries two @entity74 flags , one for each hand			0
@entity6 likes his props , especially the flags			0
for this outing he made sure he also had the @entity205 flag to carry with him			0
he also likes the attention he gets from the public , gladly stopping every few feet to pose for pictures , as he makes his way to the event hall , where his boxers are getting ready for a fight			0
" our customers , our guests , they 're as interested in being exposed to @entity6 as they are the fight card itself , " explained @entity213 , chief executive officer of @entity215 's casinos and restaurants			0
@entity6 publicly embraces the caricature of himself that he has spent decades cultivating			0
he is a public figure whose name alone can evoke adoration or abhorrence			0
when he 's out of the limelight , @entity6 is a family man often quiet and deep in his thoughts , according to his son , @entity229			0
@entity229 , 55 , is one of three children @entity6 had with his wife of over 50 years , @entity232			0
she passed away in 2010 at age 87			0
during @entity6 's time in prison , it was @entity238 who protected the children and kept the family together			0
" we moved out of the city where he was so well known ... to a rural part of @entity84 , " recalled @entity229			0
after his father 's prison stint , @entity229 said his mother continued to hold the family together while his " workaholic " father financially provided for the family during his rise to fame as @entity6 the promoter			0
" i think it 's what gives him life , " explained the younger @entity6			0
" the art of closing a deal , the art of waving the flags and being something more than just a boxing promoter who puts on boxing shows			0
" @entity6 's life at 81 seems to continue as it has for decades , with him being at the center of the ring , taking on projects that may seem impossible to others			1
@entity6 knows the odds of the @entity13 endeavor are not in his favor			1
but he says it 's not about the fight			0
" i 'm not a boxing guy , " @entity6 explained			1
" i 'm a guy that uses boxing as a catalyst to bring people together			1
" @entity2 's @entity280 contributed to this report			0

@entity6 , who turned 81 this week , is still promoting boxing matches
he hopes to *sponsor* a boxing and music event in @entity13
his office in @entity1 is a *virtual* museum of his legacy
" i 'm a guy that uses boxing as a catalyst to bring people together , " @entity6 told @entity2
