a tiny bird is frustrating game players in record numbers , again			1
this time it 's " @entity4 , " a no - frills smartphone game that has become the most downloaded free @entity6 and @entity8 app in the past week			1
the game 's fluttering rise to the top has been a viral mystery			1
its addictiveness and absurd level of difficulty have driven many to the brink of madness and spawned a number of online rants and hysterical reviews			1
the game 's concept is simple			2
you are steering a bird , a wide - eyed , 8 - bit yellow bird with no tail and some serious navigational issues			2
there is only one goal			0
tap the screen to make @entity34 fly and navigate it safely through an obstacle course of metal pipes			0
cruise through a narrow gap between pipes to get a single point			0
touch a pipe , however , and the little bird dies with a loud smack , nose - diving from the pale blue sky to the ground			0
" @entity4 " seems so easy , so completely inane that you are instantly angered by how difficult it is to keep the creature alive			1
obviously you must keep playing until you get at least one point			0
then , intoxicated by your hard - earned victory , you continue playing			0
it 's all tappity tap tap , death , anger and repeat until you notice an hour has passed , and you 've only managed to get a high score of 3 points			0
you are a smart , successful human with a college degree and a job , and you ca n't stop steering a bird through a little virtual maze in the hopes of a double - digit score			0
side effects of playing too much " @entity4 " include soreness of the tapping finger , anxiety , guilt , waves of anger and even existential crises			1
" there is little else as substantive and convincing as ' @entity4 ' that the smartphone era has driven us to the cliff of insanity when it comes to compulsive behavior , contracting attention spans , and a desire to succeed at something arbitrary and meaningless , " says @entity81 's @entity80 in an article titled " @entity4 is the embodiment of our descent into madness			1
" over at @entity90 , @entity89 wonders , " what does that say about society as a whole ? have we reached a level of boredom bordering on dangerous if we 're spending our time en masse on something so pointless ? " " @entity4 is a condition of the universe , " says writer and game designer @entity99 in a 2,800 - word article for the @entity102			1
" a condition in the sense of a circumstance , but also in the sense of a blight , a sickness , a stain we can not scrub out but may in time be willing to accept			0
a stain like our own miserable , tiny existences as players , which we nevertheless believe are more fundamental than the existence of bird flapping games or machine screws or the cold fog rising against the melting snow in the morning , " wow			0
so much angst from one little app. " @entity4 " was created by @entity4 , a @entity123 developer with a studio called @entity125			2
he did not reply to a request for an interview and has stayed mostly quiet in the wake of the game 's recent and sudden success			0
@entity132 did give an interview in january to chocolate @entity134 , saying that @entity136 mobile games are unnecessarily complicated and that he wanted to make something simple			0
even though smartphones have elevated mobile gaming with rich graphics and intricately designed apps , the platform has a history of simple , addictive games becoming incredibly popular			0
witness " bejeweled , " " @entity145 " and even the early @entity6 hit " @entity146			1
" " @entity4 " is just the latest in a string of smartphone games starring avians , though it makes " @entity153 " look like " @entity152			1
" one of the great mysteries of " @entity4 " is why it suddenly shot to the top of the most downloaded charts			1
it was originally released for the @entity6 in may but did n't become the top free @entity6 app until mid-january , following a surge in popularity that seems to have kicked off in early december			1
@entity132 told @entity162 he created the game in two to three days and says he did not promote the app in any way after its release			2
there are some unproven theories floating around about the game 's sudden success , including the use of bots to get it on top 10 lists artificially , organic enthusiasm on social media and a surge in amusing user reviews in the @entity179 and @entity180 stores			1
" @entity4 " currently has an average four - star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the @entity183 and 228,000 on @entity8			1
many of the reviews are lengthy , tongue - in - cheek tales of time lost , marriages ended and lives ruined by playing the game			2
@entity8 users report wanting to destroy their phones in frustration by throwing them off bridges , tossing them into the blades of a helicopter or running over them with 18 - wheel @entity199 trucks			2
reviewers curse the game and warn others not to follow them down the dark hole of " @entity4			1
" " my family called an exorcist to try and remove this devil game but flappy bird had already firmly gripped my soul , " said @entity205 user @entity204			2
" my boss fired me			0
my kids stopped talking to me			0
when my husband would text me , it would ruin my game			0
i blocked his number and rented out a hotel room			0
i am still in this hotel room today , " reads part of a tragic @entity183 tale from @entity220			0
meanwhile , the unlikely success of " @entity4 " has inspired serious analysis from developers interested in replicating its inexplicable hold over casual gamers			1
is it the bird ? the high difficulty level ? the temporary respite from all but the most basic brain activity ? " it consumes your every thought process and desire			1
you know you can do better so you keep playing and keep playing , " says @entity237 in an @entity8 review			2
she gave " @entity4 " five stars and is presumably still playing it right now .			2

the game " @entity4 " is the latest viral smartphone hit
its high difficulty level and adorable star have made it the top free @entity6 and @entity8 app
" @entity4 " requires gamers to navigate a flying bird through deadly *hazards*
@entity256 has inspired amusingly angry app reviews and oddly thoughtful essays
