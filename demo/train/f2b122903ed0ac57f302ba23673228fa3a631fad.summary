-- thirty was not a good year for @entity1			1
a few weeks before her birthday , she lost her job			1
then her husband left her -- with a 1Â½ - year - old at home			0
so it 's understandable that as her 40th birthday approached , the @entity10 resident was nervous			1
sure , she had a new job that she loved and her husband had returned			0
but the medical data analyst was more than 150 pounds overweight , despite working every day with experts who stressed the importance of staying healthy			1
around her 38th birthday , @entity16 came across an article about weight loss			1
it discussed aging and how middle - aged women have to work out three times a week just to maintain their weight			1
after 40 , @entity16 remembers reading in horror , metabolism slows and the pounds do n't come off as easily			1
unfortunately , says @entity0 's diet and fitness expert dr. @entity28 , that 's not a myth			1
@entity28 says she sees evidence of it all the time in her practice -- women over 40 who are attending spin class every day and restricting calories , frustrated because they ca n't drop five pounds			1
there 's nothing magic about the age of 40 , @entity28 says			1
but in the premenopausal years , a woman 's sex hormones start to change			1
the body produces less healthy estrogen , and more estrone -- a type of estrogen that comes from your body 's fat tissue			1
more estrone leads to insulin resistance and a loss of muscle mass. and with their hormones going crazy , women start to crave carbohydrates and sweets			2
" it 's like @entity60 on steroids , " @entity28 says			2
" the best thing to do is a preventative attack in your 30s			0
it 's going to be much , much harder to lose the weight in your 40s			1
" @entity16 decided to take control of her upcoming milestone			0
" at the time i was 38			0
( i thought ) , ' i 'm going to turn 40 regardless			2
why do n't i accomplish something in two years instead of being in the same place ? ' " she launched her mission : " @entity75			2
" but starting a new lifestyle was easier said than done			0
" i 'm regarded as a pretty great home cook and take a lot of pride in that , " @entity16 wrote in her @entity78 submission			0
" i 've also never been any good ( with ) sports -- physical sport typically conjured feelings of embarrassment			0
it was daunting to consider eating differently and exercising regularly because i was contemplating something larger : losing the compliments on my cooking and facing embarrassment at the gym			2
" always data - obsessed , @entity16 started using @entity94 to plot her weight along a goal line			2
she cut her calories to 1,600 a day and started logging 30 to 45 minutes at the gym three times a week			0
@entity28 says weight training needs to be a priority for women before and after 40			1
more muscle leads to a higher calorie - burn -- essential when your metabolism decides to limp along			0
also important is eating a healthy diet , @entity28 says			1
vegetables , fruits and grains should be spaced out between several servings of lean protein			0
" women are super busy in their 30s ; they 're usually raising kids or kicking butts in their career , " she says			2
" they really need to put ( the focus ) back on themselves to make a smooth transition to their 40s			0
" on the new plan , @entity16 's weight dropped at a steady rate			1
since march 2011 , she 's lost more than 100 pounds			2
along the way , she realized she had always known how to get healthy			2
the problem was n't a lack of information			0
" if you had asked me when i was at my heaviest how being heavy had impacted me , i would have said , ' not at all , ' " @entity16 says			0
" i was comfortable in my own skin			0
" she did n't consider herself unhealthy at 330 pounds			0
yet after losing weight , she stopped snoring , went off her asthma medication , felt less pain in her knee while walking and threw out the acid reflux medication she used to take before bed			2
" @entity1 is a driven , determined and strong - willed force , " her friend and co-worker @entity145 says			1
" when she committed to weight loss , there was no doubt she would succeed			0
@entity1 was never shy , but she has become even more confident , outgoing and self - assured as she has lost weight			1
" @entity16 wo n't reach her goal weight of 164 pounds -- a healthy body mass index for her 5 - foot - 8 frame -- by her birthday in february			1
she could add more intense workouts or drop her calorie intake , but she wants to maintain a lifestyle she can keep up for the rest of her life			0
as her big birthday approaches , she is n't nervous anymore			1
" i 'm excited for it , " she says			0
" i 've taken 40 into my hands			0
" share your weight loss story on @entity78			0

@entity1 got nervous about her weight as her 40th birthday approached
women 's metabolisms slow in the premenopausal years because of hormone changes
weight training and eating a *balanced* diet is important to stay healthy after 40
