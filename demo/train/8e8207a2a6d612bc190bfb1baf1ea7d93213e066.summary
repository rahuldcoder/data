" may , who is an @entity9 and @entity10 national , used her @entity10 passport to travel to @entity8 just days before the street demonstrations turned violent as @entity5 authorities cracked down on those protesting the results of the june 12 election			1
" i had been there two times before , and i feel very connected to the country and the people there , " she said			2
" i have a lot of friends			2
" her third visit took a terrifying turn saturday shortly after she checked for the latest news at an internet cafe in @entity8			1
" this young man befriended me			2
i was trying to download @entity2 to find out -- this was the day after the ayatollah gave his prayer on friday , " may said			2
afterward , the man helped her hail a taxi outside the cafe to meet one of her friends for lunch , she said			1
" about half an hour into that ride , the next thing i know , there are two motorbikes on either side of my taxi , " she said			2
" he 's on the back of one of them , and three big @entity55 guys are on the other , and they pull me over			1
i knew what was happening			0
" the @entity55 , @entity5 's feared volunteer paramilitary group , has cracked down on the thousands of protesters in the bloody aftermath of the @entity60 's disputed presidential election			1
" i was terrified , and i immediately started screaming , saying no , no , no , " may said			1
the young man climbed into the taxi and told her to go with him and the three other men			0
" so i stood up to get out of the taxi , but then i thought i 'll make a scene on the street , maybe they 'll leave me alone , " she said			0
" however , that did n't work			0
i think because everyone 's just terrified of the @entity55 right now			1
" she was forced into a car and held for more than an hour			0
her captors accused her of spying , and after much back - and - forth they drove by a police station where about 50 @entity5 police were hanging out			1
" i actually trust the police there so i banged on the window , and the guy next to me , the one who spoke @entity74 , said , ' ok , we 'll stop			0
' " they brought me into the police station where i was questioned there			0
and i had a pretty good idea at that time that everything was going to be ok because they really had nothing on me , " may said			0
" i 'm not a terrorist ; i 'm not a spy			0
so they really had nothing to go on			0
" she was told to leave the country , and she headed for @entity0 where she spoke to @entity2			0
may said she admires the bravery of the @entity5 protesting in @entity8			1
" i do n't even know how they 're doing it , because honestly everyone i know there is just scared , " she said			0
