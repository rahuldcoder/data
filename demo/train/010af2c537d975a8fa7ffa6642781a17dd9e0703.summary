-- the @entity1 , a group of @entity3 regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists , has claimed credit for a 20 - hour - long outage of the @entity9 website			1
several @entity11 users posted screenshots of a " hacked by @entity1 " message they said they received when they went to the @entity9 homepage tuesday			1
it 's not the first such action by the group ; in recent months , it claims to have hacked major @entity19 and @entity20 news organizations , as well as @entity21 and rights group @entity22			1
@entity0 has been the target of similar attacks			0
after the latest apparent hack , fresh questions are being asked about what the @entity1 is , where it 's from and how it operates			2
but , says @entity29 , a senior researcher at the @entity30 , @entity31 at the @entity32 , much about the group remains unknown			0
he has been tracking the @entity1 since may 2011 , when it emerged as an organized group with a @entity36 page and then its own website			1
in its own words , on that website , the @entity1 says , " we are a group of enthusiastic @entity40 youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in @entity40			1
" the group appears to have made it its mission to embarrass media organizations in the @entity20 and @entity51 nations it perceives as hostile to the government of president @entity54			1
according to @entity29 , the claimed attack on the @entity9 takes the group 's operations to a new level			1
" previous ones were just defacing websites , which was a kind of political graffiti , if you like , " he said			0
but to take control of the domain name means that the group could redirect traffic , giving it the potential to expose people to malicious websites or code , he said , and represents a " serious escalation			0
" the attack came as governments in several countries considered military action in light of reports that @entity54 has used chemical weapons against his own people in an effort to quell an uprising calling for his ouster			0
right after the attack , the @entity1 posted a comment , since deleted but logged by @entity29 , on its @entity36 page			2
" they said they are determined to escalate attacks on websites belonging to the @entity20 , @entity51 countries and all the countries preparing a possible military action against @entity40 , " @entity29 said			1
this suggests that the group will try to carry out more serious attacks , he said , adding that " it 's time that the @entity1 be taken seriously			1
" ' @entity99 support ' from @entity40 one key question revolves around how close the group is to the @entity54 government , which has now been involved in a bloody civil war for more than two years			2
on that subject , all the signs are of " tacit support , " @entity29 said			0
no evidence has emerged to support the idea that the group is a government operation , he said , but " they are close enough to the @entity40 regime to be able to operate freely in a country with a regime that is known for its restrictive legal and technical measures			2
" @entity116 has previously backed the @entity1 by name and " expressed his appreciation for their work and described them as a real army on the @entity124 , " @entity29 said			0
the group 's domain name was registered by the @entity127 , which was headed by @entity54 in the 1990s , before he was president , he added			2
the @entity1 was even hosted on the network of the @entity40 government until june , when the domain name was suddenly suspended			1
the group was without a website for a short time before reappearing on a commercial @entity134 service , @entity29 said			0
the domain name 's suspension occurred a few days after the @entity20 government seized several key @entity40 government sites , @entity29 said , leading researchers to believe that the move was intended to create some distance between the hacker group and the @entity40 government			1
while there 's no evidence linking the @entity1 to the @entity134 authorities , @entity143 is seen as friendly to the @entity54 regime , making it unlikely that the @entity134 company will be asked to stop hosting it			2
mystery members who the individual members of the @entity1 are and where they 're from is also shrouded in mystery			0
they claim to be mostly @entity40 in @entity40 , but the group also recruits members through @entity36 , @entity11 and its website , @entity29 said			1
a core appears to coordinate attacks , but the group solicits suggestions for targets through an open forum			0
it also appears robust , bouncing back despite the efforts of @entity20 authorities and @entity11 to suspend its activities and developing its methods over time			2
early attacks focused on apparently irrelevant websites , but later efforts shifted toward compromising first the @entity36 pages of organizations seen as hostile to the @entity40 government and then high - profile @entity11 accounts and the @entity9 website			1
in the early days , it used @entity176 , or distributed denial of service , attacks , but its methods then grew more sophisticated			0
and it may operate in cyberspace , but its attacks can have real - life impact , as was shown when the group hacked the @entity186 @entity11 feed in april			1
it sent out a tweet reading , " breaking : two explosions in the @entity190 and @entity191 is injured , " causing a brief flurry of panic and temporarily sending stocks plummeting			0
@entity29 predicts that the group will continue to look for soft spots to exploit in the wake of the attack on the @entity9			2
" it 's not just what they want to do or could do ; it 's what are the available vulnerabilities out there , " he said			0
the hackers will probably continue to target the websites of @entity20 and @entity51 media organizations , as well as some @entity209 sites , especially if international military intervention does occur in @entity40 , he said			1
they could carry out more @entity176 attacks and may seek to use malicious software to steal private information from @entity40 dissidents , he said			0
as well as wanting to stay one step ahead of the @entity218 , competition is a factor in spurring them on			0
in recent weeks , some @entity222 groups have emerged , one calling itself the @entity223 , in a reference to one of the key rebel groups involved in the fight against @entity54 's forces			0
a sectarian divide has also emerged , with some @entity231 groups defacing @entity234 groups ' websites and vice versa , @entity29 said			0
against this backdrop , the @entity1 is not likely to quit cyberspace any time soon , and the @entity9 may not be the last to fall victim to its efforts			2
" it 's up to the media to beef up their security so they can not carry out these kinds of attacks , " @entity29 warned @entity186 hack proves @entity11 has a serious cybersecurity problem @entity251 chief @entity250 's @entity11 account hacked @entity0 's @entity252 contributed to this report .			1

the @entity1 has claimed an attack on the @entity9 website
the attack is a " serious escalation " in the group 's operations , says a researcher
it 's targeting @entity20 and @entity51 media perceived as hostile to @entity40 's government , he says
an attack on the @entity186 @entity11 feed caused a flurry of panic and sent stocks *plunging*
