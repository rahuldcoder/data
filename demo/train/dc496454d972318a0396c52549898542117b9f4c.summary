-- whether they 're raising their adopted baby girl , dodging homophobic quips from their fraternity brothers or teaching the " @entity9 " dance to the football team after glee club , it seems gay characters are becoming a vital part of prime time tv			2
with characters like " @entity27 's " @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity16 from " @entity17 " and @entity18 from " @entity19 , " the number of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity25 ) characters on scripted programs has just about doubled since 2005 , according to the @entity28			1
and characters will continue to identify as @entity25 as time goes on , such as " @entity33 's " @entity31 , who recently had his first same - sex kiss			1
but @entity34 , president of @entity28 said , " we still have a long way to go before we 're fully represented [ on ] tv			1
" in addition to the increasing number @entity25 characters on scripted shows , which currently represents a little more than 3 percent of all leading and supporting characters on broadcast networks , there are also more openly gay actors and producers working in @entity47 , says @entity34			1
actor @entity48 plays the character @entity14 on the @entity51 prime time show " @entity27			1
" like his on - screen role , @entity48 himself is openly gay			2
" the opportunity to play not only a well developed gay character , but a dad , a son and brother was really appealing to me			0
... i chose to play him very close to myself and i think that truthfulness was appealing to the creators , " @entity48 told @entity0			0
however , @entity48 says his sexual orientation does not make him any more qualified to tackle a gay role than @entity64 , his straight co-star who plays @entity14 's partner @entity15			1
" as a gay man and as someone who is an advocate for equality , truthfulness and fairness , i want to see more gay roles go to gay actors , " @entity48 said in an e-mail			0
" but then on the flip side , as an actor , i want to still be given the opportunity to play roles that are straight			2
" in a recent interview on the @entity79 , @entity64 said he 's excited he has been given the opportunity to portray one half of a committed gay couple raising a child -- a first , he said , for broadcast tv			1
" our goal is to make people laugh , but while we 're making people laugh , if we can open a couple minds here and there , that 's also an added benefit , " he said			2
and while shows like " @entity27 " are working to open peoples ' minds about same - sex parents , the " l " and the " t , " of @entity25 , are still waiting for their tv time , said @entity47 casting director @entity97			1
it 's very common for female characters to be portrayed as bisexuals instead of lesbians , she said			1
" i would n't say it 's because of a discomfort with lesbianism , it 's just an interest in bisexuality , " @entity97 said			1
" [ people ] think it 's hot , and it gives characters a wide variety of storylines			1
" and as far as the " t , " she said , " transgender people are not represented in our daily lives with the same frequency that gay and lesbian people are			0
it 's harder to find an audience that will embrace a transgender character			2
" @entity124 , the executive producer of @entity125 's " @entity17 , " said he has loaned some of his own experiences as an openly gay man to the show			2
and when casting , an actor 's sexual orientation does not come into play			1
" when you 're in casting , it 's not appropriate or legal to say , ' hey , are you gay ? ' whether they 're gay , straight , from the @entity137 , @entity138 or from @entity139 , it does n't matter			1
the best person who captures that character gets the job			0
" and for @entity124 , straight actor @entity143 was the best person for the role of @entity145 , a gay member of @entity146 , a fictional fraternity on " @entity17			1
" @entity143 said he does n't think twice about the intimacy between him and the three actors he 's made out with on the series			1
his girlfriend does n't either			2
it 's just acting , he says			0
but with the exception of @entity153 , who came out in 2006 , playing a straight character on " @entity155 , " straight actors are more often tapped for gay roles , rather than the other way around			0
" many gay actors , who are not out in @entity47 , are afraid ( coming out ) will compromise their ability to get roles , " @entity34 said			1
" but [ @entity25 ] actors need to feel as if they can be who they are and still make it in @entity47 or homophobia wins			1
" both @entity48 and @entity124 identified themselves as gay before beginning careers in @entity47 , but @entity124 said he understands why some people are apprehensive about coming out once they 're in the spotlight			0
" people want to succeed and avoid any potential pitfalls , and coming out is definitely one that can draw attention to you that might make other people in this town fearful of hiring you , " said @entity124			0
" for me , i 've never really questioned it			0
i 've worked with great guys			0
for them it was n't an issue , but i 'm aware of other parts of this industry			0
" people want to watch characters they can relate to , said @entity124 , who was very excited to welcome " @entity27 " into his living room			0
" @entity48 and i ... get so many compliments from gay couples and lesbian couples that want to introduce us to their kids and thank us for representing them on tv for the first time , " @entity64 told @entity190			0
but still , " @entity27 " is n't hitting viewers over the head with @entity15 and @entity14 's physical intimacy			2
" we 're the perfect show to just build it in naturally , not draw a bunch of attention to it , " @entity64 said			0
for @entity48 , it 's a non-issue			0
" i want the viewers to know @entity14 and @entity15 's sex and love life is just fine , " @entity48 wrote			0
" they also have regular bowel movements , but that is something you do n't see either			0

it does n't matter if an @entity25 actor plays an @entity25 role , said @entity28 's @entity34
