at a town hall meeting where he campaigned for health care legislation in 2009 , president @entity0 pledged to voters that he did not want any tax on health insurance plans he perceived as wastefully generous to ever impact average @entity6			1
but in recent comments by one of the men who helped draft the legislation , @entity13 economist @entity12 , that is not only precisely what will happen -- but that was the intention of the tax			1
@entity18 officials had no comment , despite repeated requests by @entity21			0
at issue is the tax on so - called " cadillac plans , " more expensive employer - provided health insurance plans			1
while employers do not currently have to pay taxes on health insurance plans they provide employees , starting in 2018 , companies that provide health insurance that costs more than $ 10,200 for an individual or $ 27,500 for a family will have to pay a 40 percent tax			1
at a town hall meeting on health care on july 23 , 2009 in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity0 explained that the thinking of the @entity40 tax was to target plans that spend unnecessarily and excessively , thus driving up health care costs , such as a $ 25,000 plan , " so one that 's a lot more expensive and a lot fancier than the one that even members of @entity47 get			2
" the thinking , @entity0 explained , was that " maybe at that point what you should do is you should sort of cap the exclusion , the tax deduction that is available , so that we 're discouraging these really fancy plans that end up driving up costs			0
" the president at that point had n't yet signed off on a @entity40 tax ( he would eventually ) but he did make the pledge : " what i said and i 've taken off the table would be the idea that you just described , which would be that you would actually provide -- you would eliminate the tax deduction that employers get for providing you with health insurance , because , frankly , a lot of employers then would stop providing health care , and we 'd probably see more people lose their health insurance than currently have it			1
and that 's not obviously our objective in reform			0
" that promise is completely at odds with how @entity12 describes not only that provision of the @entity80 , or @entity80 , but the intention of that provision			0
in one of the videos that surfaced in recent days in which the man described by the @entity0 campaign as having helped to write @entity80 describes the many ways voters he calls stupid were easily misled about the bill by those pushing it , @entity12 says the @entity40 tax will do exactly what the president pledged it would not -- dissuade employers in general from providing insurance for its employees			1
" economists have called for 40 years to get rid of the regressive , inefficient and expensive tax subsidy provided for employer provider health insurance , " @entity12 said at the @entity97 for public policy research in @entity99 in 2011			1
the subsidy is " terrible policy , " @entity12 said			2
" it turns out politically it 's really hard to get rid of , " @entity12 said			0
you can watch the full remarks here			0
@entity12 said the only way those pushing for @entity80 could get rid of the tax subsidy for employer provider health insurance was to tax the more generous , or @entity40 , plans -- " mislabeling it , calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it 's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans			1
" the second way was have the tax kick in " late , starting in 2018 " and have its rate of growth tied to the consumer price index instead of to the much higher rate of medical inflation			0
eventually , the 40 % tax on the more expensive plans would impact every employer - provided insurance plan			2
" what that means is the tax that starts out hitting only 8 % of the insurance plans essentially amounts over the next 20 years essentially getting rid of the exclusion for employer sponsored plans , " @entity12 said			2
" this was the only political way we were ever going to take on one of the worst public policies in @entity6			0
" by 2018 , @entity12 said , those who object to the tax will be obligated to figure out how to come up with the trillion dollars that repealing the tax will take from the @entity146 , or risk significantly adding to the national debt			0
this is obviously exactly what @entity0 told voters in 2009 he had " taken off the table			0
" it is exactly a process to " eliminate the tax deduction that employers get for providing you with health insurance " that five years ago @entity0 noted would result in " a lot of employers then would stop providing health care , and we 'd probably see more people lose their health insurance than currently have it			1

at issue is the tax breaks *business* get for providing employees health insurance
@entity0 said only ' cadillac plans ' would be affected by this *change* under his **law**
@entity13 economist @entity12 said tax breaks to employers for all plans are ' terrible policy '
eventually every health insurance plan would be affected by the **law** *due* to inflation
