-- when doctors had to remove @entity5 's lower legs in november after he contracted meningococcal disease , his parents hoped students at his university would receive protection against it			1
so far , they 're still waiting			2
@entity5 , a promising lacrosse and soccer player at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , was the victim of an outbreak of meningococcal disease , a bacterial infection that causes bloodstream infections and meningitis			1
meanwhile , across the country at @entity22 , eight cases of meningitis b were reported last year			1
@entity22 was given special permission to use a new vaccine			1
four meningococcal disease cases were reported at @entity13 , but the vaccine is not being used there			1
some of the @entity13 cases were caused by type b bacteria , the same strain as at @entity22 , although officials found no link between the two outbreaks			1
@entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 students have access to a meningitis b vaccine called @entity40 , but the @entity41 still has n't approved it for routine use in the @entity43			1
@entity5 's parents hope that will change			2
" it 's absolutely devastating to have @entity5 , in the prime of his life , be stricken " with the disease , @entity46 said previously			2
" we hope that @entity5 's horrific illness brings increased awareness and rapid approval by the @entity41 of the vaccine " for the type b strain			1
the @entity57 sent a team of scientists to study the outbreak in @entity61 in december			2
it recently amended a letter it wrote to the @entity41 to get special permission to use the unlicensed vaccine to include @entity13 students , but permission has not yet been granted			1
" you do n't go online and order 10,000 doses and get next - day delivery of this vaccine , " said dr. @entity69 , chief of the @entity57 's meningitis branch			1
" fortunately , he said , a meningitis b outbreak moves more slowly than others			1
you have a bit more time to get everything in place			2
" 8th case of meningitis confirmed at @entity22 in december , the @entity41 agreed to the @entity57 's request to give @entity22 special permission to bring the vaccine over from @entity35 to protect its students			1
the @entity57 had been carefully monitoring the @entity22 cases since the first couple of students had been diagnosed about nine months before			1
meningitis b outbreaks are rare but can be deadly , according to the @entity57			2
in 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis ; some 160 of those were group b , the agency said			2
there 's an approved vaccine for other types of meningitis			1
there is none for group b , which is the one the @entity57 describes as " pack ( ing ) the most powerful punch			0
" college dorms are perfect breeding grounds for an outbreak			2
this infection of the protective tissue around the spinal cord and brain called the meninges can spread when someone coughs or sneezes			0
it can spread if people forget to wash their hands or belongings , or through sharing a glass or a kiss			0
excessive alcohol use leaves people susceptible to it			0
and it 's tricky , because students who get sick with it may think they merely have flu			1
patients experience flu - like symptoms : fever , headache , stiff necks , vomiting and delirium			2
but if the bacteria spreads to the meninges , patients can suffer hearing loss , permanent neurological damage , and even death			0
@entity145 , the @entity146 company that makes the group b vaccine , declined @entity0 's interview request , but confirmed it is working with the @entity41 for approval			1
a press release on its website from december said : " over the last few weeks , we have been working closely with officials at @entity22 and the @entity57 to put in place a timely and decisive response to the outbreak			1
this situation serves as a reminder that @entity159 can strike anyone at any time			2
" @entity145 successfully tested the vaccine on almost 8,000 infants , children , adolescents and adults			0
that qualified the vaccine for a license in @entity170 last january			0
@entity37 approved it in august , and @entity36 in december			0
in an e-mail to @entity0 , the @entity41 explained it is kept from legally " discussing investigational drug applications			0
" however , the fact that the vaccine has n't been approved yet has been criticized by at least one former @entity41 scientist			0
" the @entity41 's demands are excessive , " said dr. @entity177 , the @entity178 in @entity179 and @entity180 at the conservative @entity181 at @entity182			0
@entity177 spent 15 years at the @entity41 and founded its office of biotechnology			0
he has written extensively about his belief that the @entity41 has gotten " fanatically risk - averse			0
" in the past five years , the @entity41 has approved only a couple of new vaccines on average every year			0
but a 2012 study in the @entity192 found that the @entity41 review time is comparatively faster than @entity35 's or @entity36 's			1
@entity177 believes the @entity61 students could have been vaccinated by now if the @entity41 had granted accelerated approval			1
accelerated approval means the @entity41 would temporarily allow @entity43 use of the vaccine without this extra step involving the @entity57 letter requesting special permission			1
accelerated approval , he said , still leaves the @entity41 a legal mechanism to withdraw the vaccine			1
meningitis outbreak : @entity61 students wait for vaccine " the @entity41 should have negotiated in good faith for reciprocity with their foreign counterparts , " @entity177 said			1
dr. @entity212 , a former @entity41 senior medical officer and @entity41 regulatory expert , said vaccine approvals generally require special caution			2
" when our @entity41 gives its approval to a drug , this is the gold standard for drug approval in the world , " said @entity212 , who is now an associate professor of pharmacology and medicine at @entity218			0
if a drug is going to be approved in the @entity43 , he said , there should be " no room for doubt of its clear safety and efficacy			0
" @entity212 points to the 1960 's @entity233 scandal as the primary example of why the @entity41 's strict standards are essential			0
the morning sickness drug had been approved in the @entity237 and in @entity35 , but pregnant women who took @entity233 had babies with severe birth defects			0
in the @entity41 's careful review of the drug , medical officer dr. @entity241 discovered @entity233 had never been tested on pregnant animals			0
her discovery and her agency 's refusal to approve it averted a major public health catastrophe in @entity43			0
the @entity41 's drug and vaccine approval process is exhaustive			1
pharmaceutical companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on testing that can take several years			0
scientists must prove vaccines are safe and effective in the lab , in animal tests , and then in larger and larger groups of humans			0
the companies send the @entity41 test results throughout the testing phase			0
before digital records , @entity212 said it took more than one loaded 18 - wheeler of paperwork for the @entity41 review			0
" it 's not an easy process to review such voluminous amounts of data , while simultaneously being mindful to enforce the heavy federal regulations concerning new drug approval in the @entity43 , " @entity212 said			1
the @entity41 is still reviewing the results for the meningitis b vaccine			2
@entity145 , meanwhile , said on its website it is " committed to continuing the dialogue with the @entity41 to find a licensure pathway to bring a @entity159 vaccine to the @entity43 to fulfill this unmet public health need for the future			0

a meningitis b outbreak hit students at @entity22 and @entity13
@entity22 students got special permission to get unlicensed vaccine , @entity13 's still waiting
vaccine approval is a *complicated* and time - consuming process
