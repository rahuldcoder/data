the private spaceflight company @entity1 will launch another mission to the @entity3 on tuesday , but the real highlight of the event could be back on @entity6			1
a @entity8 rocket will lift the cargo into orbit , and for the first time , the company will try to land the rocket 's first stage on a floating platform			1
traditionally , rockets have been designed to fall back to @entity6 after separating from the spacecraft they lifted , and then burn up on reentry or crash into the ocean			0
the millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets burn , too			0
@entity1 wants to pioneer a reusable rocket , a development that could change the economics of space travel			1
" a fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access , " @entity1 said in a news release			2
the company has twice attempted soft landings of the @entity8 's first stage on water			2
those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero , and deploy landing legs			0
in those tests , the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean , causing damage that made the rocket unusable			0
that was according to plan , @entity1 said			2
on tuesday , the company will try the same soft landing for the @entity8 's first stage , but this time on a custom - built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship			1
landing on the platform " is significantly more challenging " than the water landings , the company said			0
for one , the platform is not anchored , and while the platform looks large from the ground , it is a rather small target for the 14 - story - tall rocket			0
@entity1 described reentry and landing as " trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm			2
" the company puts the odds of success at 50 % at best			1
it adds , however , that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for reuse			0
as for tuesday 's target , " x " marks the spot : the company will try to land the rocket stage on the @entity1 logo painted on the center of the floating platform .			1

@entity1 is *scheduled* to launch a rocket tuesday
in a first , the company will try to land the rocket 's first stage
there is at best a 50 % chance this attempt will succeed , @entity1 says
