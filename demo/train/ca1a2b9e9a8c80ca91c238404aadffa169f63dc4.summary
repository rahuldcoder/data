ousted @entity3 president @entity6 appears tuesday at the @entity8			1
@entity6 was removed by the military on june 28 and flown to @entity10			1
congressional leader @entity11 was sworn in as provisional president later that day			0
the @entity2 set a saturday deadline for @entity3 to return @entity6 to power or be suspended from the 35 - nation hemispheric organization			1
@entity3 officials told @entity2 secretary general @entity17 on friday that they would not allow @entity6 to return to power			1
thousands of protesters demanding the return to power of ousted @entity3 president @entity6 pushed through riot police at @entity25 's airport and surrounded the terminal saturday , but there were no reports of violence			1
the airport continued to operate , @entity1 correspondent @entity30 reported			0
@entity6 , a leftist who took office in 2006 , says he will return to @entity3 on sunday			1
@entity11 has vowed to have @entity6 arrested if he returns			1
" i am simply defending a system , " @entity6 told the @entity2 delegates early sunday , after the 33 - 0 vote to suspend @entity3			1
among the delegates were two heads of state : presidents @entity38 of @entity39 and @entity40 of @entity41			0
" i am here not only as president of the republic of @entity39 , but also as part of a delegation who was the object of coups in @entity39 , " @entity42 said			0
@entity40 also spoke in favor of restoring @entity6 and democracy to his nation			2
" i come from @entity41 , a country that has had the long night of dictatorships , " @entity40 said			0
" i come here with a pain , but also with a hope			0
" @entity11 repeated in an interview with @entity58 on saturday night that a coup did not take place			0
what happened , he said , was a constitutional transfer of power authorized by the nation 's congress			0

" if the @entity2 does n't deem @entity3 worthy of membership of the @entity2 , then @entity3 would renounce with immediate effect the @entity80 charter , " said deputy foreign minister @entity76			1
at the center of the dispute was a referendum @entity6 had vowed to carry out even after the country 's supreme court and congress found it illegal			2
the nonbinding referendum could have led to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country 's charter to allow the president to run for re-election			0
@entity95 president @entity94 , a @entity6 ally , won a similar referendum this year , and many @entity3 thought @entity6 was trying to maneuver a way to seek re-election in november			1

since then , the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people , about 70 percent of whom live in poverty			0
military interventions were once common in @entity113 , but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s			0
before sunday , the only other barracks revolt this decade was an unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against @entity94 , when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement			0
