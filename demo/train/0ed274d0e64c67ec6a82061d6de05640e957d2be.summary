, the terrorist group which @entity1 intelligence agencies believe may have been behind the @entity15 attack in @entity16 , @entity1 officials tell @entity5			1
they say the new measures will feature additional random checks after passengers make it through security and will include passenger pat - downs , bag checks and hand swabs for traces of explosives			1
the new issue of @entity13 's @entity29 magazine , released on december 24 , featured instructions on how to build what @entity13 called a " hidden bomb " from easily purchasable materials			1
it also included directions on how would - be lone wolves worldwide can evade airport security scanners and sniffer dogs			0
in recent months , @entity13 's leadership has repeatedly stated hitting the @entity1 is a priority			1
the new issue of @entity29 made clear it viewed lone wolf attacks by its supporters in the @entity44 as an increasingly important part of these efforts			1
the magazine claimed the recipe was for a simplified version of the device used in an attempt to blow up a @entity1 passenger jet over @entity53 five years ago			2
on christmas day 2009 , @entity54 , the so - called " underwear bomber , " attempted to detonate an explosive device built by @entity56 , @entity13 's master bomb - maker , on a flight from @entity59 to @entity53			1
the main charge -- a white powdery explosive called @entity62 which airport security scanners at @entity59 did not detect -- failed to detonate as the plane approached @entity53			0
the new recipe does not involve the manufacture of @entity62 , a substance difficult for extremists to manufacture or obtain in the @entity44			0
instead , it contains similarities to a bomb formula put out by the group in the first issue of @entity29 in 2010 called " make a bomb in the @entity74			2
" that recipe was downloaded and used by the @entity76 bombers and several other extremists in plots on both sides of the @entity80			0
in the new issue , @entity13 suggested its external operation division had greenlighted sharing the recipe because @entity56 and his team had developed a new generation of more sophisticated devices			2
what is @entity13 ? in 2012 @entity88 and @entity44 intelligence foiled a plot by @entity13 to bomb a @entity1 plane with an updated version of the underwear device			1
it is not clear if the recipe is viable or if it would have enough explosive power to endanger an aircraft			0
nor is it clear if the device would have any chance of getting through explosive scanners at airport security			0
@entity1 officials and explosive detection experts tell @entity5 that advanced detection equipment , including body scanners , should catch even previously hard - to - detect explosives like @entity62 , even if detection experts say they do n't provide a 100 % guarantee			2
but @entity1 officials say advanced body - scanning technology is not available in some smaller @entity1 airports			2
the authors of the latest issue of @entity29 magazine claimed that if enough lone wolves launch attempts with their suggested device , some would get through			0
the magazine stated that even if the devices were detected or malfunctioned they would bring terror to the @entity44			1
the key aim , the group stated , was to undermine the @entity1 economy			0
it listed several @entity1 airline companies , as well as @entity128 and @entity129 carriers as targets			0
it said that lone wolves should claim responsibility by writing emails timed to be distributed after their operations			0
in the 112 - page issue the group also mentioned recent lone wolf attackers in @entity140 , the @entity1 , @entity141 and @entity129 , calling a hatchet attack on @entity144 police officers in @entity145 in october " splendid			1
" counterterrorism officials on both sides of the @entity80 been concerned about technical instruction provided by @entity29 for several years			1
in august 2013 the @entity128 security agency @entity149 revealed to the @entity128 parliament 's intelligence and security committee that " @entity29 " has been " read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the @entity128 since its first issue ( in 2010 )			1
we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots			0
