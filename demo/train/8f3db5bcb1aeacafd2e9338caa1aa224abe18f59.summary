-- @entity2 president @entity1 opened the door to the possibility of his country going back to international bodies in an attempt to get a $ 17 billion payout from the @entity9			1
but the @entity9 considers the case closed , according to @entity11 , a @entity12 spokesman			2
the money was originally awarded to @entity2 in 1986 by the @entity14 in the @entity15			1
@entity2 had gone to the court alleging that @entity9 involvement in their civil war by arming , financing and supplying the @entity22 fighters was a breach of international law			1
the @entity26 country also alleged that @entity9 overflights and attacks on @entity2 ports violated its sovereignty			1
the court sided with @entity2 , and ruled that the @entity9 was to pay reparations			1
@entity2 asked for $ 17 billion , though an amount was never set			0
the @entity9 , which did not recognize the jurisdiction of the court in this case , resisted international pressure to pay , and eventually , under the administration of president @entity38 , @entity2 dropped its claim from the @entity40 in 1991			1
the @entity40 subsequently issued an order removing @entity2 's case from the court 's list , @entity11 said			1
" in due time we will call for a referendum , " @entity1 said tuesday , referring to the revival of the claim			2
@entity1 was speaking at an event commemorating the fall of former dictator @entity51 , which brought the @entity53 to power			0
the aim of the @entity57 was to destabilize the @entity53 , the party @entity1 belongs to			0
the president said he would call for " a referendum so that the people ... say whether or not we collect this debt that the ' @entity64 ' government owes			0
" " @entity2 has a legitimate position to be entertained and debated , " said @entity65 , director of the @entity66			0
however , it is unlikely that @entity1 would seek such a referendum , which would stir the pot with the @entity9 , he said			1
in some ways , @entity1 has proven to be more pragmatic in his actions than his rhetoric suggests , @entity65 said			0
if @entity2 chooses to revive the lawsuit , it could be because the impoverished nation sees the $ 17 billion -- or even a settlement at a fraction of that amount -- as a quick boost to the country , he said			0
the case is most likely closed forever , said @entity83 , a law professor at the @entity84 who was on the @entity9 legal team in the first phases of the case			2
when @entity2 dropped its claim , it did so by stating in a letter that it " had decided to renounce all further right of action based on the case and did not wish to go on with the proceedings			2
" there is a precedent that such declarations are binding , @entity83 said			0
" i would think the case is now closed , " he said .			0

@entity1 says he may hold a referendum to see if case should be revived
the @entity14 ruled in 1986 against the @entity9
at issue is @entity9 involvement in @entity2 's civil war
