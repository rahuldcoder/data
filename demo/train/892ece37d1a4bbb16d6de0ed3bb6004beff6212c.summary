" @entity35 has proven to be a minefield for celebrities , " @entity28 said tuesday			1
" it provides celebrities with an opportunity to make any number of careless mistakes that can come back to haunt them			0
but in a war environment , where emotions are so high and people are seeing pictures on @entity1 of babies dying and crying , it 's particularly incendiary			2
" the 140 characters in a @entity35 posting are " like you 're burping out thoughts , " @entity28 said			1
for @entity14 , it was a hashtag -- # @entity19 -- the caused an uproar on sunday			0

" the fast deletion was followed by controversy and debate			0
one fan tweeted , " what 's the point in being rich & famous if you ca n't publicly stand up for what 's right ? " @entity2 's condemnation of @entity5 was not a spontaneous or accidental message			1
the actor sent a 400 - word letter to @entity113 newspapers last week entitled " genocide			1
" " in the horror that is happening in @entity11 , there is no room for distance or neutrality , " @entity2 wrote			1
" it is an occupational war and an extermination one against a town with no means , confined to minimum territory , without water and where hospitals , ambulances and children are targets and alleged terrorists			2
it is difficult to understand and impossible to justify			0

@entity144 sent a statement to @entity1 on wednesday defending her participation in the letter : " i do n't want to be misunderstood on this important @entity149 i 'm not an expert on the situation and i 'm aware of the complexity of it			2
my only wish and intention in signing that group letter is the hope that there will be peace in both @entity5 and @entity11			2
i am hopeful all parties can agree to a cease fire and there are no more innocent victims on either side of the border			0

" Â @entity8 , the actress cast as the new incarnation of @entity9 , used her @entity176 page to show support for @entity5			1
her posting is not a surprise , considering she served in the @entity5 army and represented her country as miss @entity5			0
" i am sending my love and prayers to my fellow @entity5 citizens , " @entity8 wrote			0
" especially to all the boys and girls who are risking their lives protecting my country against the horrific acts conducted by @entity191 , who are hiding like cowards behind women and children ... we shall overcome ! ! ! @entity197 ! # weareright # freegazafromhamas # stopterror # coexistance # loveidf " @entity5 model @entity198 quoted @entity199 in an @entity201 post with the hashtag # stopterror : " there is no honorable way to kill , no gentle way to destroy			1
there is nothing good in war , except its ending " comedian @entity210 , whose career is built on controversial commentary , used humor to defend @entity5 in a tweet : " dealing w / @entity191 is like dealing w / a crazy woman who 's trying to kill u - u can only hold her wrists so long before you have to slap her " sometimes it is silence that speaks			1
@entity28 said that some of @entity29 's most prominent @entity226 , who are " very politically active for liberal causes , " have " not said a word of support of @entity5 " concerning the crisis			1
for some @entity80 , @entity11 conflict strikes close to home opinion : five lessons of the @entity11 war how long will it last ? @entity11 conflict by the numbers @entity1 's @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			2
