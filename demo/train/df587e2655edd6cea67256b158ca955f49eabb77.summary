@entity0 was once an open , flamboyant bisexual man from @entity1 who built up a career as a model , performance artist and @entity5 in @entity6			1
photographs of him semi-naked while riding a horse and brandishing a gun are a feast for web surfers			2
but after he and his partner @entity12 were attacked outside @entity13 , and especially since a bill banning gay " propaganda " was passed in june , @entity0 has feared for his safety			1
he is losing business -- and blames that on the law and an increasingly less tolerant climate towards homosexuality			1
" people in the regions are very aggressive towards gays			2
@entity12 and i were lucky to be alive last year because some people wanted to kill us			2
my fear has been growing since then			2
" and recently , " i was working on my video when i turned on the tv and saw video of one anchor of a @entity6 channel who said that you need to burn the gays ' hearts , " he told @entity29			1
" i had to continue to smile , perform , say ' hello sexy ' but it was difficult			2
i started to be afraid			0
" i 'm dressed down now when i go on to the street and i 'm afraid police could arrest me			0
they can implement the law against me			1
i know that i 'm not safe			0
" i 'm afraid to do what i used to			0
i 'm scared to come to the streets now wearing wigs or heels			0
i 've started to wear them much more rarely			0
" when he was growing up in the @entity51 era , " life was easier , " he recalled			0
" there was no pressure to make you chose who you are			0
" indeed he does n't even define himself as a gay man at all			1
" i 've never actually thought about myself being a gay or a straight or anything else			2
i still do n't think about it and i did n't think about it in my childhood			0
" @entity6 insists the new law , which bans " propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors , " is intended to protect children			1
it bars discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children			2
international rights groups have called the legislation highly discriminatory , as anti-gay attacks are on the rise in @entity6 and are sometimes perpetrated by the police themselves			1
there have been widespread calls for boycotts and protests -- including a vodka - dumping demonstration in @entity84 -- casting a pall over the @entity86			0
the gay rights group , all out , has delivered a petition with hundreds of thousands of signatures denouncing @entity6 's stance on gay rights			1
@entity0 , who lives in @entity13 , said that although he believes the law is " designed against people with non-traditional sexuality " he does not support a boycott			1
" i hear a lot now about boycotting the @entity98 or vodka			0
why ? first of all , because we all know that no one will ever boycott @entity98 for the sake of this because financial interests of the countries are more important than the freedom			0
" such a move could cause a backlash against homosexuals , he fears			0
" it may even be designed against the gay community of @entity6 to turn everyone against them			1
because people will say that it 's gays who sabotaged and boycotted the @entity98 and people will just burn us with our hearts			2
" opinion : make @entity98 in @entity6 " the gayest ever " @entity13 , a city of more than 11 million people , has only a handful of gay night clubs , none of which would allow @entity29 's cameras inside			1
and on the street , few people are willing to be identified			0
@entity131 says most of @entity13 's gay population has always lived in secret -- and that they now have even greater reason to embrace anonymity			1
the gay scene here is often referred to as a ghetto			1
@entity131 says : " [ gay people ] are n't imposed to stay in the ghetto but they feel more comfortable because they can be themselves			1
" @entity141 says outside the ghetto there 's a clear rule -- do n't ask , do n't tell -- but that he wants more from life			1
" it 's very bad			2
i want to live in open life			0
and i want to live my life			0
it 's not my choice , it 's my life , " @entity141 says			2
what does the future hold then for gays in @entity6 ? @entity0 understands why acceptance in the country has come slowly , but says : " @entity6 would benefit from appreciating gays the same way that @entity158 appreciate their cows			1
to me , gays are usually kind , talented , genial , creative and i feel sorry that they 're leaving			0
" i think it will be back to normal again in 10 years but the new young generation should come to power and change the laws			0
maybe we 'll see the first @entity6 gay president in 10 years			1
or maybe it will be a woman			0

@entity0 had built up a career as a model , performance artist and @entity5 in @entity6
he is now losing business and blames it on a @entity6 law banning gay " propaganda "
most of @entity13 's gay population lives in secret and city has few gay clubs
" @entity187 " is the *unspoken* rule outside @entity13 's gay " ghetto , " says one man
