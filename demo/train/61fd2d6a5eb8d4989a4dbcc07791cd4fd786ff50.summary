editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is the broadband television network of vice			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
this video contains vivid images depicting extremely graphic violence			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- we thought that since you were feeling absolutely dejected watching @entity24 's underwater gusher spoiling the ecology and economy of the @entity27 , well , we would try to cheer you up by reminding you how the otherwise environmentally conscious @entity28 are degrading their own natural splendor and national soul with oil spillage and seepage on purpose			1
bitumen -- @entity35 tar sand -- is barely oil			0
it 's oil - soaked dirt , but in a world that is constantly scraping the bottom of the fossil fuel barrel , tar sand is oil enough to warrant a mad frenzy to extract			1
and that 's exactly what is happening in the @entity28 northwest			1
@entity45 is rich -- very rich -- in bitumen			1
@entity47 is the small town at the epicenter of a boom in tar sand extraction , and it 's a messy , ecologically unsound adventure			2
traditionally , the only way to get oil from the dirt has been to cook it			2
so , every day , massive excavators rip apart the @entity57 ( also known as the lungs of @entity28 ) to get at the soggy oil sand below , and then millions of gallons of pristine @entity62 water are intentionally spoiled in order to boil the oil out of the dirt ( or is it the dirt out of the oil ? )			1
it 's a very messy , destructive process , which has contaminated rivers and lakes for miles in every direction			1
see the rest of " toxic : @entity45 " at @entity9 there is a newer method of extraction , called @entity74 , in which steam is injected deep underground , cooking the oil out of the dirt and then siphoning the oil out of the boiling mess			1
we spent two weeks in and around @entity47 , @entity82 , documenting what the recent boom has done to the fragile ecology and the local economy			2
it 's a classic boom town , with classic boom town problems : expensive housing , high food prices , overcrowding , traffic and congestion , and charming little additions like alcoholism , cocaine and meth addiction , and prostitution			0
what we learned is that we desperately need a clean energy policy			0
the @entity45 tar sands must be the dirtiest " last chapter " of our century - long fascination with oil			1
we should n't want to live in a world which tolerates boiling dirt for every last drop of tar .			0

@entity28 northwest rich in what is essentially oil - soaked dirt
oil extraction process messy , has contaminated *nearby* rivers and lakes
@entity9 goes to @entity45 to document *impact* on ecology , economy
