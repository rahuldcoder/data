-- it could be argued when @entity4 left the office of prime minister in june , his parting from the public stage was mourned by few but chief among those mourners were @entity8 's satirists			1
the characteristics of the @entity4 government with its emphasis on spin and sound bites created a wealth of material for top @entity8 satirist @entity18			1
dubbed " the wittiest writer in @entity8 today , " by comedian @entity20 , @entity18 's new book @entity21 celebrates a decade of satire that @entity18 thought would never end			1
he writes : " for years , he seemed so permanent ; it was hard to imagine that @entity4 would one day become a forgotten figure , like @entity25 or sir @entity26			1
he seemed more ubiquitous than @entity27 in her prime			2
perhaps this was because she was so unique ( or so peculiar , according to one 's taste ) while @entity4 was an archetype , a familiar figure from all our pasts : the eager boy with his hand in the air throughout double maths ; the well - spoken estate agent ; the energetic youth leader , full of exciting new ways to cross a river			1
" @entity18 has been satirizing @entity8 politicians and celebrities for almost 30 years in a variety of publications from @entity49			1
he writes regular satirical columns in both the @entity51 and @entity52 where targets are as disparate as feminist @entity54 , ' glamour model ' and author @entity55 and playwright @entity56			1
while @entity18 's writing is consistently witty , clever and often laugh out loud funny , @entity18 himself is softly spoken and self deprecating			1
" i 'm not actually funny in real life , " he says			2
" usually people can do one of the two ( write with humor or speak with humor ) there are hardly any people who can do both like @entity20			0
" occasionally @entity18 will perform his work before an audience , which he enjoys ( " i rather like reading my parodies out			1
there nothing like having an audience laughing " ) but the life of a satirical writer is often one that 's quite isolated from his audience			0
instead he is quite happy working from his home in the country and keeping a low profile			1
he admits to only visiting the offices of employer , @entity51 twice ( " i never know quite what to do with myself in an office " ) and spending a large part of the day in his pajamas			1
he even shy 's away from calling himself a satirist -- a term he thinks has become loaded : " i used to think of myself as a satirist but satirists are people who really want to be politicians			0
satire is an unfunny form of humor and it has an agenda that works against the comedy			1
satirists think they can change the world , and that 's an illusion			0
" part of success as a satirists ( or humorists as some like to be called ) is to capture the not just the personality they are satirizing but the zeitgeist of the times			0
for @entity18 part of the zeitgeist of the @entity4 years are @entity112 , @entity113 , binge drinking , the acceleration of the cult of celebrity but most of all spin : " publicity was all : privacy dwindled			1
" the thirst for spin extended to unlikely quarters observes @entity18 : " i could n't believe it when the @entity126 appointed a pr -- even a secret society wants to raise the profile			1
" " as for @entity4 -- there were things about him that were very funny			1
there was the spin which @entity135 had n't developed and that 's always funny -- its also funny parodying conference speeches			0
they are always parodied baby - talk , lower than banal -- those were funny with @entity4			1
" @entity18 parodies @entity142 's conference speak in the @entity143 as sounding like this : " i believe in @entity8			1
great ! a country with a great history			2
great ! ... i want a @entity8 that we can all feel part of			0
i want a @entity8 in which what i want for my own children i want for yours - but only after i have got it for mine			0
" @entity18 's inclination towards satire started young			1
a pupil at @entity156 , he coped with being away from home at a young age by mimicking teachers			2
" i was at a boarding school since i was 7 and i had a tape recorder : all the people you are terrified of you can reduce			0
we did their voices and dramatizations			0
@entity169 prep schools when you 're very young and you are threatened by these very gothic figures ; it 's ( mimicking ) a way of reducing people			0
" over the years his parodies have hit the mark , sometimes a bit too closely			2
one target , @entity54 " was very touchy when i first met her ( but ) angry people are always funny to parody			0
" he says the journalists he has parodied " are more touchy than politicians			0
politicians are aware they are being hated from the moment they are elected			0
" but @entity18 does n't feel guilty about upsetting his targets			1
news reporting has the capacity to inflict greater wounds , says @entity18			2
" other forms of journalism are more hurtful			0
the raw materials of journalism can hurt people a lot more			0
the act of printing is the original hurt and the gags come later			0
i used to worry if the targets liked or disliked them -- now it does n't matter			0
now it does n't matter if they like it or not			0
" @entity18 admires satirists that reduce things " to the essence of itself			2
" he 's keeping an eye on new prime minister @entity210 , who will present different challenges from @entity4 : " i think @entity210 has an anger in him			2
everyone says how awkward and controlling he is -- it will surface soon			0
" and the satire wo n't be too far behind			2
