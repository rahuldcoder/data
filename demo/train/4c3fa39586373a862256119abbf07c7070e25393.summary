@entity0 -- the @entity2 rejected a @entity4 measure wednesday to expand offshore oil and gas drilling in @entity7 coastal waters , signaling a continued partisan stalemate over energy policy and , more specifically , how to respond to rising gas prices			1
the bill was defeated in a 42 - 57 vote			0
sixty votes were required for passage			0
five @entity4 -- @entity16 's @entity15 , @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity20 's @entity19 , @entity22 's @entity21 , and @entity24 's @entity23 -- voted against the bill			1
one @entity26 , @entity28 's @entity27 , did n't vote			0
on tuesday , the @entity2 rejected a @entity30 measure to strip major oil companies of about $ 20 billion in tax subsidies over the next 10 years and use the savings to pay down the federal deficit			1
among other things , the @entity4 bill would have required the @entity37 to complete a number of offshore lease sales in the @entity40 and off the coasts of @entity42 and @entity43			1
it also would have extended lease terms by one year for @entity40 contracts suspended by the drilling moratorium imposed by the @entity49 administration in the wake of the @entity52 oil disaster			2
the @entity4 bill would have established a 30 - day review period for drilling permit applications , and allowed for default approval if an application was n't rejected within 60 days			1
the @entity37 would have been required to provide a rationale for rejecting a permit application			0
" at a time of near - record gas prices , this is a modest approach , a good first step that takes everyone 's concerns into account so that we can actually achieve a practical result , " said @entity2 minority leader @entity59 , @entity60			1
" it 's time to stop holding @entity7 back with moratoriums , fees , bureaucratic roadblocks , and the ever - expanding reach of a president who seems to think that business owners in this country need to get his permission first if they want to create jobs			0
" @entity80 argued that the @entity4 plan would do little to ease the country 's long - term energy crisis			1
" we ca n't lose sight of the fact that our great country uses more than 25 % of the oil ( consumed in the world ) on any given day , and we have less than 3 % of the oil reserves , " senate majority leader @entity84 , @entity84 , said tuesday			2
" we need to do everything we can to increase domestic production , but there 's a limit to what we can do , " @entity84 said			0
the @entity4 measure " on its face does n't make a lot of sense , " he said			2
the @entity101 , a nonprofit environmental group , called the bill a " misguided attempt to expand drilling and weaken safety and environmental oversight			1
" some senators from oil - producing states argued the bill did n't go far enough			2
@entity109 and sen. @entity110 , @entity18 , claimed it would actually " slow down the permitting process instead of streamlining and accelerating it			0
" the bill " would add an unnecessary and burdensome new layer of regulation regarding containment plans just when energy companies have figured out how to comply with the administration 's new requirements , " they argued in a joint statement			2
president @entity49 used his weekly address last saturday to push what he called " safe and responsible " oil production			0
administration officials have said they are working to speed up the leasing process for the @entity127 , while also giving oil companies better financial incentives to use and extend certain existing leases in the @entity40 and elsewhere			1
the president also has indicated he backs steps to accelerate the testing of areas off the @entity134 for possible future drilling			0
at the same time , however , @entity49 also has announced the formation of an interagency working group to oversee @entity139 drilling projects to make sure they meet health , safety and environmental standards			0
the president opposes controversial plans for drilling in @entity43 's @entity146			0
@entity4 leaders argue the @entity148 has not done enough to bring down gas prices , which are now topping $ 4 a gallon in many parts of the country .			1

the @entity2 has rejected a @entity4 bill to expand offshore oil and gas drilling
a *faster* process for permit applications was among the bill 's elements
a @entity30 plan to strip billions in tax subsidies for oil companies failed tuesday
*democrats* and @entity4 are at odds over how best to address rising gas prices
