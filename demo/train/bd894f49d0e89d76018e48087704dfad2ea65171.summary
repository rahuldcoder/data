-- the 1970s were the first full decade after civil rights legislation all but obliterated racial segregation in the @entity3			0
and it was in large part because of this great sea change that a bright , bold flowering of @entity8 affecting music , movies , fashion , television , sports and literature burst forth , its impact resonating with a breadth and force that had never been witnessed before -- or seen since			1
@entity18 , who was found dead wednesday , at age 75 , in his @entity21 home , was one of the significant figures of this transformative era			2
as the creator and longtime host of the tv music - and - dance show , " @entity28 , " @entity18 took an established broadcast genre of dancing teenagers , hit records and live performances by pop stars and infused it with assertively @entity35 - @entity3 style and attitude so electrifying that its appeal crossed racial , ethnic and even generational lines			1
as filmmaker @entity39 helped set off the black - movie boom with 1971 's " @entity41 " ; as @entity43 's ribald , so - real - it 's - surreal stand - up comedy hit its stride by mid-decade ; as @entity57 's 1976 epic family saga " roots " became the keystone to a nationwide phenomenon whose culminating tv miniseries is still talked about 35 years later , so did @entity18 establish , through " @entity28 , " a crucial gauge for pop music 's ebb and flow that no one in the entertainment business could ignore			1
the elite of late - 20th century black pop musicians , from @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , to the @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 took live turns on the " train " -- and frequently delivered some of their more potent televised performances			1
eventually , white artists such as @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 played on the " @entity28 " stage			2
though he wisely never made himself more conspicuous than the music or the dancers , @entity18 ' buttery smooth baritone , colorful attire -- though relatively understated when compared to the dancers ' flashy duds -- and avuncular presence provided an anchor for the show 's dazzling grooves and slick moves			1
he also became something of a star himself , making appearances at live concerts and political gatherings looking to share some of the youthful energy he presided over as host from 1970 to 1993			0
other tv shows may have had live acts			0
but if you wanted to know how to move your body to funk , disco and soul music , " @entity28 " provided the first and best lesson for much of its long and legendary run			1
@entity114 , in a " @entity116 " interview , said he was a " @entity28 " fan			2
one imagines the great man studying and perhaps even attempting many of those moves			0
if you were a true dance aficionado , you waited every week for the " ' @entity28 line " in which improbably limber young couples enacted breathtaking inventories of what would become known as " breaking " and " popping			1
" before he became an innovator , the @entity124 - born @entity18 sold insurance for @entity128 @entity127 for $ 250 a week			1
in 1966 , he decided to change his destiny , and reduce his salary by $ 200 , to work as a substitute disc jockey , news reader and interviewer at @entity134			0
within two years , he had acquired enough facility as a broadcaster to secure an on - camera job as sports anchor on @entity124 's @entity139 , " a @entity35 's @entity140			0
" with his own money , @entity18 produced a pilot episode of an all - black version of @entity145 's venerable " @entity144 " to be telecast on @entity139			1
he had trouble interesting sponsors until the locally based @entity147 expressed interest , believing the show could boost its record sales			0
the program , dubbed " @entity28 , " debuted in 1970 , achieving such formidable ratings among the city 's black community that it was nationally syndicated the next year			1
@entity18 not only served as " @entity28 's " host , but was also responsible for drumming up advertisers and seeking more stations nationwide			1
some of these advertisers were black - oriented companies such as @entity160 , the beauty specialists behind @entity163 hair spray			2
by mid-decade , " @entity28 " had powered its way to more than 100 markets			0
by the time it ceased production in 2006 , after a series of guest hosts , " @entity28 " had become one of the longest running syndicated television programs in history			0
one wonders whether it 's possible in this digitized age to build a cultural phenomenon from the ground up as @entity18 did			2
if so , his example of chutzpah and daring will serve as the template for future dreamers and cultural mavens to follow			0
that , along with the blend he suavely , fervently prescribed to his audiences week after week at the end of each " train " : " @entity190 ! peace ! and -- all together now -- soul ! " join the conversation on @entity193			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0
