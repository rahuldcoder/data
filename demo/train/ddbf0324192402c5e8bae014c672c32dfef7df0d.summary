@entity0 -- many @entity2 had awoken with a jolt that morning in april 1982 as news of the invasion on their digital clock radios left them struggling to believe their ears , oblivious even to the breezy new duet by @entity9 and @entity10 that followed			1
but the panic had faded by the time they had boiled their kettles for tea and poured the milk onto their cornflakes with the realization that the little - known @entity20 were not , as most had assumed , just off the coast of @entity22			1
and , with the discovery that the islands were thousands of kilometers away on the other side of the world , and home to more penguins than people , most simply shrugged			0
any thought of defending the islands was , of course , ridiculous			0
it had hardly been @entity2 's finest hour to have been shown up as the decrepit ruritanian relic it had become by @entity37 's brutal military junta			1
but the sun had been setting on the empire for decades and a guano - stained archipelago hardly seemed to offer good value for money for already overstretched @entity2 taxpayers			1
indeed the continuing existence of such imperial anachronisms was something of an embarrassment to the center - right @entity49 government of the day , led by the supine @entity51 , as it sought to forge closer ties with @entity54 neighbors still wary of the @entity2 's jingoistic past			1
within days the @entity57 ocean liner had been dispatched to the @entity58 to collect those islanders who wanted to return home to the land of their distant forebears			0
a lightly populated island in the outer @entity64 was identified and the islanders handsomely compensated for the inconvenience of having had their spare rooms and sandwich toasters occupied by polite but nervous teenage @entity37 conscripts			1
most felt that justice had eventually been done when @entity74 , fueled by the desire to extract some revenge for the humiliation of 1982 , beat @entity37 on their way to winning the 1986 @entity76 in @entity77 , albeit with the help of a large slice of luck when @entity81 , now remembered as the greatest player of his generation , blatantly handled the ball for his first goal			1
perhaps buoyed by the ease with which the @entity20 issue had been resolved ( @entity89 newspaper had hailed it as the greatest @entity2 retreat since @entity92 ) , @entity51 had embarked on a game show - style giveaway of the last remaining blobs of pink on the world map			1
a memorable sketch by the " @entity99 " satirical tv show portrayed him as @entity102 , host of the popular @entity2 version of " @entity104 , " announcing " @entity105 ! come on down ! @entity106 ! @entity107 ! " as @entity108 and @entity109 were hurriedly handed over to their new masters like the keys to a new speedboat			1
but it was the next government that would lay the foundations for the prosperous and cohesive @entity2 we live in today			1
the 1984 election had thrown @entity119 's @entity118 into coalition with the centrist @entity122 - @entity121 , a configuration that seemed to reflect the harmonious spirit of the era			0
sensing a defining shift in public mood , @entity119 announced that the @entity2 would decommission its @entity129 nuclear deterrent and abandon plans to replace it			1
he also pulled @entity2 troops home from bases all over the world , slashing military expenditure			2
the consequences could not have been more far reaching			0
@entity137 followed suit , decommissioning its own nuclear weapons and hailing a new spirit of entente cordiale by announcing ambitious plans to link @entity143 to @entity0 via a rail tunnel under the @entity145			1
with @entity2 declaring itself nuclear weapon - free , the @entity146 moved its stockpile of warheads to @entity150			1
but this provoked mass protests in @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , as well as in @entity157 and the @entity159 cities of @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , as those on both sides of the @entity165 rejected the stranglehold that the two superpowers had exerted on @entity54			0
by 1990 both @entity168 and @entity169 had withdrawn their forces from the continent and the @entity173 was over			0
in the @entity2 , meanwhile , in addition to massive savings on the slimmed down military , the government had also found its coffers swollen by the proceeds of the @entity181 oil boom			2
much of the money was diverted to northern @entity74 , regenerating a region that had been long dependent on old fashioned manufacturing industries as a hub for new technologies and computing in a process known as the @entity189			0
there were complaints from @entity0 of a growing north - south divide as tax breaks and deregulation attracted the smartest talent from the nascent computing scene in @entity197 and elsewhere , with @entity198 swapping steel for microchips and the @entity201 dubbed " @entity202			0
" but nowadays @entity203 dominates the market not just in home computers and laptops but in mobile phones , while @entity209 's latest tablet had geeks queueing outside spectrum stores in @entity0 , @entity212 and @entity213			0
the rest of the money was placed in a sovereign wealth fund that has ever since lavished the @entity2 people with the most generous welfare system on the planet and made the @entity220 a beacon of medical research			2
@entity2 scientists pick up @entity225 prizes so frequently these days that they are hardly deemed newsworthy , but one has stood out above all others for her contribution to the wellbeing of the planet			2
@entity231 had originally planned to go into politics , but she had soon found that the prospects for a female mp in the then - male dominated world of @entity236 were far from enticing			2
returning to her first love of chemistry , she proved to be a determined , dedicated and headstrong researcher with a natural aptitude for leadership , rising through the ranks to run her own medical laboratory			0
her achievements included developing a treatment for emphysema , a breakthrough for which she was lauded by the @entity250			0
in the former colliery villages of northern @entity74 , long retired miners still raise a glass to @entity254 , as she is affectionately known			0
but it was her groundbreaking work on cancer cells that would eventually earn @entity231 the @entity225 medical prize			2
as she had eloquently put it as she collected the award in @entity261 , urging others to continue her relentless fight against the disease , " we always have to be aware of the enemy within			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity268 .			2

former @entity2 prime minister @entity231 died last week aged *87*
@entity268 *imagines* what might have happened if she had chosen different *career*
@entity2 would have handed over @entity20 to @entity37 and abandoned nuclear weapons , he says
