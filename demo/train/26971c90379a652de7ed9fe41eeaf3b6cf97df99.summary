@entity0 -- @entity2 anticipated a struggle when he launched an @entity5 - inspired comic book series that he hoped would become a symbol of tolerance			1
he worried about the comics being banned in @entity9 - which wound up happening , briefly -- and he expected to be challenged by conservatives in @entity5 , since @entity2 wanted to buck the trend of @entity5 culture being directly tied to the @entity13			1
but it was n't an @entity5 cleric that stalled the series , called " the 99 , " after the 99 attributes of @entity19 , which the superheroes are supposed to embody			1
it is the @entity23 market , and the voices of @entity5 's @entity26 critics , that have caused the most problems for " the 99 , " says @entity2 , who is the focus of a @entity30 documentary airing next week			1
in 2010 , president @entity31 called the comic books , which debuted in 2006 , " the most innovative response " to @entity23 's expanding dialogue with the @entity5 world , which @entity31 has encouraged			1
the series features 99 superheroes from across the globe who team up to combat villains and who embody what @entity2 calls basic human values like trust and generosity			1
but @entity2 , a @entity46 - born clinical psychologist and graduate of @entity48 , says a vocal minority have raised surprising questions about @entity23 tolerance of @entity5			1
the idea for " @entity53 " started during a conversation in a @entity56 cab between @entity2 and his sister			2
it took off , although slowly , after @entity2 raised $ 7 million from 54 investors across four continents			2
the first issue was released during the @entity5 holy month of @entity63 in 2006			2
the comic book was quickly banned in @entity9 and @entity2 received threats of fatwas against him and his project from clerics			1
but @entity9 eventually lifted the ban and the television adaptation of " the 99 " will be aired there this year			0
@entity2 and his team have now raised more than $ 40 million in venture capital for the project			2
but when word leaked that @entity79 , a @entity82 cable and satellite television venture , purchased the series and planned to air it in the @entity23 , the response from conservative bloggers and authors was swift			1
@entity85 , founder of the @entity87 blog , called the series , part of the " ongoing onslaught of cultural jihad , " and created a counter-comic strip that made the 19 hijackers behind the september 11 , 2001 attacks the superheroes			0
@entity96 columnist @entity95 , meanwhile , urged readers to " hide your face and grab the kids			0
coming soon to a tv in your child 's bedroom is a posse of righteous , @entity107 - compliant @entity5 superheroes - including one who fights crime hidden head - to - toe by a burqa			1
" according to @entity2 , the criticism spooked @entity79			1
" all of a sudden we could n't get an air date and i was asked to be patient and we have been , " @entity2 said			2
" but it has been a year and the actual push - back died down			0
" a spokesperson for @entity79 told @entity1 that " ' the 99 ' is one of the many shows we have on the possible schedule , but at this time , no decisions have been made about scheduling			0
" @entity2 is n't shy about responding to the criticism his comics have received in the @entity23 " there is nothing different from them and the extremists in my country , " he says			1
" they are just as bad			0
they are just intellectual terrorists			0
" @entity85 , author of the book " @entity136 , " called @entity2 's statement " ridiculous victimhood rhetoric			2
" " he is the one mainstreaming oppression and discrimination , " @entity85 says			0
" i work for equality of rights for all people			0
so which one of us is the intellectual terrorist ? " @entity85 also takes issue with @entity2 's assertion that " @entity53 " exemplifies " moderation " and " toleration , " pointing to a " burqa - wearing superhero			2
" but @entity2 says criticisms of burqas are evidence that , " for some people anything to do with @entity5 is bad			1
" " how @entity155 is it that characters created to promote tolerance are getting shot down by extremists , " he says			0
@entity160 's frustrations are chronicled in the new documentary " @entity162 ! @entity163 ! @entity5 ! , " which will air on @entity30 on october 13 as part of the @entity167 series			2
the film 's director , @entity168 , began shooting before the comic was released			0
he said that one of the most surprising aspects of the story is how " a very small group of people who scream very loud , have a disproportionate share of the public discourse when it comes to culture			0
" echoing @entity2 , @entity168 calls it a case of the tail wagging the dog			0
he says that initial concerns of censorship in the @entity186 began to change as the project progressed			0
" we were waiting for a fatwa from a cleric in @entity9 , @entity168 says , " when it ended up being the @entity23 market that has been resistant to " the 99			0
" " realizing that the 99 will not survive if focused solely on the @entity186 , @entity2 must now target an international and predominantly @entity196 market , " reads the website for " @entity162 ! @entity163 ! @entity5 ! " citing @entity79 holdup , @entity168 says the project is now stuck in the most important market " for " the 99			1
" @entity2 is also trying to gain distribution for his tv series in @entity202 and other countries , but his main focus remains the @entity23			1
" one way or the other , " he says , " ' the 99 ' will get on air in the @entity23 "			0
