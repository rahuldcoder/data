@entity0 -- @entity2 had been in @entity3 a week when she answered an ad on @entity5 looking for actors for an action - adventure film called " desert warrior			1
" now , @entity2 says she feels betrayed by the @entity10 filmmaker who turned the low budget - movie with a threadbare plot into an anti-islam film that provoked outrage -- with sometimes violent results -- in parts of the @entity18 world			1
when news broke that violent mobs attacked the @entity22 consulate in the @entity24 city of @entity25 , leaving ambassador @entity26 and three other @entity22 dead , she was overwhelmed			2
" i was shaking when i found out			1
i had no idea , " @entity2 told @entity1 on sunday			1
" this was a movie that i thought no one would ever see			2
" @entity2 knew the filmmaker as @entity31			1
but federal officials say his name is @entity31 , a convicted felon with a history of using aliases to hide his actions			1
anti-islam filmmaker meets with probation officer they consider @entity31 to be the filmmaker behind " @entity40 , " an amateurish film that portrays the @entity42 as a womanizer , buffoon , ruthless killer and child molester			1
@entity18 categorically forbids any depictions of @entity42 , and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the @entity18 world			2
the movie , backed by hardcore anti-islam groups in the @entity22 , is a low - budget project that was ignored in the @entity22 when trailers were posted on @entity55 in july			1
but after @entity58 television aired certain segments , violent protests erupted in @entity58 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and the @entity68 territories			2
crew was " grossly misled " @entity2 was one of about 79 cast and crew who say they were " grossly misled " when they answered casting calls on @entity5 , @entity77 magazine and other publications in july 2011 for a film that was described as " an historical @entity81 adventure			1
" but from the beginning , @entity2 said the cast and crew had questions , including why the central character in a period piece had a @entity89 name			1
" we did wonder what it was about			2
and we were like , ' this is the @entity96 2,000 years ago			2
who 's @entity94 ? ' " she said			2
she says never heard any talk of politics or religion from the man she knew as @entity31			1
after the location shoot wrapped , @entity2 said she and others were brought in to dub lines			1
" they brought the actors in in post ( production ) and had them say specific words			2
like ' @entity42 , ' for example			2
it was n't in context , " she said			2
" they 'd say ' @entity118 , ' and they 'd ( the actors would ) say ' @entity120 ' why ? " when the film was complete , it was no longer a desert adventure about a man named @entity94 but rather an @entity126 movie about @entity42			2
opinion : do n't blame the video ; defend free speech " he knew what he was doing			2
he was playing us all along , " @entity2 said			1
another actress , @entity133 , said last week she spoke with the producer after the unrest began			2
" he said he wrote the script because he wants the @entity18 to quit killing , " @entity136 said			2
" i had no idea he was doing all this			1
" the 79 cast and crew members released a statement saying they were " extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer			0
" they said they were " shocked by the drastic rewrites of the script and lies that were told to all involved			0
we are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred			0
" when news of his movie first broke , the filmmaker , identifiying himself as @entity31 , told the @entity154 that he was a 52 - year - old @entity66 - @entity22 real estate developer from @entity10			1
he said @entity156 donors contributed $ 5 million to finance his film			0
but @entity66 's foreign ministry said there was no record of a @entity31 with @entity66 citizenship			1
" this guy is totally anonymous			0
at this point , no one can confirm he holds @entity66 citizenship			0
and even if he did , we are not involved , " ministry spokesman @entity165 said			0
a search by @entity1 of public records related to @entity31 came up empty			1
a search of entertainment records turned up no previous mention of a @entity31 , and the directors and writers guilds had no listing for him			1
in the @entity154 interview , the filmmaker characterized his movie as " a political effort to call attention to the hypocrises of @entity18			1
" " @entity18 is a cancer , " he said			0
" the movie is a political movie			0
it 's not a religious movie			0
" opinion : the reality of @entity189 @entity1 has not been able to speak with the filmmaker			1
a production staff member who worked on the film in its initial stages told @entity1 that an entirely different name was filed on the paperwork for the @entity196 : @entity197			0
he believed the filmmaker was a @entity199 and when the two spoke on the phone during production , the filmmaker said he was in @entity204 , @entity58 , raising money for the film			1
in @entity58 , tension has emerged in recent decades between @entity18 and the minority @entity208			0
another staffer who worked on the film said he also knew the producer as @entity213			0
that 's how he signed a personal check to pay staff			0
he was married with two children			0
the daughter helped during production and even brought in lunch on a few occasions , the staffer said			0
neither staffer wanted to be identified for security reasons			0
opinion : video does not represent @entity208 community @entity31 's criminal record in the days that have followed , federal officials have confirmed that the man calling himself @entity232 is , in fact , @entity31 , a man with a criminal record and history of using aliases			1
@entity31 was convicted of bank fraud in 2010 and served one year in federal prison at @entity239 , @entity10 , before being released on supervised probation for five years			1
according to court records , @entity31 used at least 17 false names			1
over the weekend , @entity31 was questioned by federal probation authorities who are conducting a review of his case to determine if he violated any of the conditions of his parole			1
@entity249 , a spokeswoman for the @entity250 , did n't provide details of why or when the probation review was initiated , or how long the process would take			0
while on probation , @entity31 ca n't access computers or any device that can access the internet without approval from his probation officer			1
the terms of his parole also says he can not " use , for any purpose or for any manner , any name other than his / her true legal name or names without prior written approval of the probation officer			0
" anti-muslim activist @entity271 , who said he was a script consultant for the movie , said the filmmaker told him his idea was to make a film that would reveal " facts , evidence and proof " about the @entity42 to people he perceived as radical @entity18			1
" our intent was to reach out to the small minority of very dangerous people in @entity10 and try to shock them into understanding how dangerous @entity18 is , " @entity271 said			0
" we knew that it was going to cause some friction , if anybody paid attention to it , " he said			0
but when @entity271 went to the film 's screening in a @entity0 theater , no one was there			0
" it was a bust , a wash , " he said			0
but a while later , the trailers were online			0
they were segments focusing on the @entity42 and posted under the title , " @entity302			0
" the trailers were translated into @entity304 , and @entity58 television aired certain segments			0
since then , @entity31 has been out of public view and ensconced with his family in their home in @entity312 , @entity10 , where journalists have been gathered seeking information about his elusive background			1
are you witnessing the attacks ? share your images but stay safe			0
@entity1 's @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
