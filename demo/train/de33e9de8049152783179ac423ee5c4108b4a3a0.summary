-- @entity3 chief executive @entity2 ' announcement today at the @entity4 that @entity3 's new @entity6 service will allow music fans to reproduce their entire digital collections on locker - style servers accessible via 10 devices -- including iphones , @entity13 and computers -- may not save the ravaged record industry , but it could provide a crucial new revenue stream while allowing consumers to easily consolidate their music libraries in the cloud			1
" keeping these devices in sync is driving us crazy , " @entity2 said in his keynote speech today at the @entity4 in @entity21 today			0
" we have a great solution for this problem			0
we are going to demote the pc to just be a device			0
we are going to move the digital hub , the center of your digital life , into the cloud			0
" rumored for weeks , @entity6 will be free for up to 5 gigabytes of music downloaded via @entity35 , @entity2 announced			2
the service will scan and match users ' current music collections for music carried by the @entity40 , and then make it available to all of the users ' devices by sending the songs ' metadata to the cloud			2
the new @entity35 imatch service will cost $ 25 a year , with unlimited storage , for users to copy digital music ripped from cds or downloaded illegally			1
( the free version is available immediately , while @entity53 will roll out in coming months , most likely with a new version of @entity3 's operating system in the fall			1
) the service will also allow storage of movies , photos and other data files , replacing @entity3 's @entity62 , in an attempt to shift consumers from physical hard - drive to web - based storage			1
choose @entity0 's cover : the @entity68 vs. @entity69			0
vote now " it is one way to make someone pay for music they 've already bought			0
it 's pretty ingenious , " @entity75 , a former @entity76 executive who is now a consultant to artist managers and record labels , tells @entity0			2
" i 'm sure someone in an executive office at a major label somewhere is going , ' at least that 's one way we can monetize the stuff people stole from @entity86 over the years			0
' " @entity3 is n't the first to provide such a service -- @entity88 unveiled its @entity89 in late march , and @entity90 jumped into the market with @entity92 a month ago			1
( also , in the late 1990s , @entity93 created a very similar service , @entity95 - it , but since the company had no licenses with major labels , @entity96 successfully branded it illegal piracy and sued , putting the service out of business			1
) but , in a swipe at his competitors , @entity2 declared @entity3 's @entity6 to be significantly faster than @entity88 and @entity90 's services			1
" it certainly appears like it 's going to be a better experience , " @entity75 says			0
" the @entity88 and @entity90 services were an attempt to bring them to market quickly			2
" and more important , unlike competitors @entity90 and @entity88 , @entity3 has licensing deals with record labels to use their vast song catalogs by artists from the @entity117 to @entity118 to @entity119 in the new service			1
as the world 's biggest music retailer , with longstanding label deals for @entity35 , @entity3 had the clout to make these deals where @entity88 , @entity90 and @entity125 could not			1
the deals allow @entity3 to scan a user 's hard drive and make copies of the songs in the cloud , rather than forcing users into the cumbersome process of uploading their collections			2
" you do n't have to store individual copies of every track			0
which @entity88 and @entity90 do , " says a source at a major label			2
" and they have to pay for storage costs			0
... scan - and - match is a big advantage of a licensed locker			0
" @entity3 entered the music business in 2002 , when it made digital - music deals with major record labels still shell - shocked from @entity86 and online piracy			1
in so doing , the computer company almost singlehandedly transformed the record business ' longstanding sales model from selling $ 15 to $ 18 cds to far less profitable 99 - cent digital tracks			0
@entity3 did not give music companies a cut of the @entity156 , @entity157 or other devices , however , and record executives have loudly complained as @entity3 's shares have skyrocketed during the same period labels have laid off staff , cut artist rosters and in the case of once - powerful @entity76 , flirted with bankruptcy			1
@entity167 ' life in @entity168 : her rise , fall and comeback labels have struggled in the past several years to find new revenue streams , and numerous top executives point to music subscriptions as a powerful new business model based on monthly fees			0
however , existing subscription services such as @entity179 and @entity180 have yet to gain a foothold in the @entity183 music market , and @entity183 labels have yet to make deals with @entity125 , the free service that has been popular in @entity186 the last three years			2
also , in the past , @entity2 has been critical of the subscription model , although he seemed to change his position in late 2009 , when @entity3 bought the growing subscription company @entity190			2
for @entity6 , @entity3 will give the four major labels almost 60 percent of future profits , as well as roughly 12 percent to music publishers , according to music - business sources			1
( one source at another major label says @entity3 will determine future percentages based on labels ' sales -- and that labels will then give profit shares to their artists based on the artists ' sales			1
) many in the music business predict @entity3 will use @entity6 as a gateway to a broader subscription service , perhaps in the next few months , although @entity2 did not address this point in his speech			1
" it 's a good start , " says another music - business source			0
" if everyone in @entity183 who consumed music paid $ 25 to put their music in a cloud and then [ @entity6 ] turns into a subscription - based music service -- does n't sound bad to me			1
those economics would work well for everyone			0
