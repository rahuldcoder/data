the humor at the 98th annual @entity1 went to the dogs			2
president @entity3 poked fun saturday at everything , from the @entity7 scandal to the lavish spending by the @entity9 , to the upcoming general election			1
however , it was a spoof about @entity12 and his dog @entity13 that highlighted the president 's monologue			1

" i know everybody is predicting a nasty election , and thankfully , we 've all agreed that families are off - limits , " the president said			1
" dogs , however , are apparently fair game			1
" the president 's punch line : an ad by a phony @entity38 that featured @entity12 on @entity39 with a dog cage on top of the aircraft and promoted dog freedoms , while warning of @entity3 's policy of dog socialism			1
" under his leadership , man 's best friend has been forced into automobiles			0
imagine the @entity52 - style socialism that he has planned for the next four years , " the spoof ad said			2

" that 's pretty rough			0
but i can take it , because my stepfather always told me , it 's a boy - eat - dog world out there , " @entity3 said			1
the president referred to former vice-presidential candidate @entity70 's recent guest hosting on " today , " saying it " reminds me of an old saying -- what 's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ? a pit bull is delicious			2
" the dinner was @entity3 's fourth as president			1

the annual gala , also known as the " @entity105 , " raises money for journalism scholarships			0
while the dinner is notorious for its sometimes bawdy political humor , the president took a serious moment to recall the deaths of @entity113 of the @entity114 and @entity115 of the @entity116 , " who made the ultimate sacrifice as they sought to shine a light on some of the most important stories of our time			0
" @entity113 and @entity124 died in february while covering the conflict in @entity126			0
overall , @entity3 stayed true to the theme of the night -- humorous barbs			2
he joked about business tycoon @entity129 , whom the president kidded at last year 's dinner about pushing the president to release his long - form birth certificate			1
" we gather during a historic anniversary			0
this weekend last year , we finally delivered justice to one of the world 's most notorious individuals , " @entity3 said to a packed ballroom at the @entity137			1
a photo of @entity129 was shown , rather than that of slain @entity145 leader @entity144			0
@entity3 then went back even further in time			2
" four years ago , i was in a brutal primary battle with @entity147 , " @entity3 said			2
" four years later , she wo n't stop drunk texting me from @entity149 , " a reference to the city where @entity7 agents allegedly consorted with prostitutes			0
the president also took aim at the scandal , itself : " i had a lot more material prepared , but i have to get the @entity7 home in time for their new curfew			0
" @entity3 , speaking before comedian @entity162 , made light of a @entity165 conference in @entity166 that cost more than $ 800,000			1
" look at this party			0
we have men in tuxes , women in gowns , fine wine , first - class entertainment			0
i was relieved to hear it was not a @entity9 conference , " @entity3 quipped			2
he even chided @entity162 , star of @entity177 's " @entity178 " " @entity162 got his start on the ' @entity180			1
' in @entity82 , that is what we call a congressional hearing on contraception			0
" @entity162 , who took the stage following the president 's monologue , hit back			1
" remember when the country rallied around you in the hopes of a better tomorrow ? " @entity162 asked			2
" @entity162 said there was a term for " guys like the president , " and it was n't two terms			1
he said he told the @entity7 that for $ 800 , he would stay away from jokes about the scandal			0
" but they only offered $ 30 , " he said			0
nobody in the room was safe from @entity162 's barbs , which he fired at politicians , journalists , celebrities and corporate executives in attendance			1
@entity162 praised @entity210 's work to combat obesity with her health initiative			1
the comedian then pointed out rotund @entity215 gov. @entity214 to the first lady			0
" look , it 's @entity214			0
get him , " @entity162 said			2
