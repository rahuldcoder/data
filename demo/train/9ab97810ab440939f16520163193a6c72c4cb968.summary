-- @entity1 will always have brotherly love for @entity3			1
after all , @entity4 was once named @entity5 and used to be @entity5 's brother			1
until 2005 , @entity4 lived as @entity5 -- or , as his family called him , @entity8			1
that year , he told his sister he had been living with gender dysphoria , which the @entity11 defines as " a marked incongruence between one 's experienced / expressed gender and assigned gender			1
" " this was my 59 - year - old brother , " @entity5 said of the revelation in a phone interview			1
" he had been this little boy , and all my memories had been of a male			2
it makes you revisit your whole past			2
" @entity5 details the experience with a critical but compassionate eye in her latest book , " my brother @entity29			1
" at the time of the announcement , @entity8 was married to a woman , @entity34 , and a loving stepdad to their two children			1
@entity4 , now divorced , lives as a heterosexual female after gender reassignment and facial reconstruction surgeries , hormone therapy and a wardrobe overhaul			1
@entity5 recently spoke to @entity0 about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling			1
the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			2
@entity0 : you 've obviously come to terms with @entity3 's decision			1
what did it take on your part ? @entity5 : first of all , i realized very soon that it 's very overwhelming			1
i knew i could never say ' do n't do this			2
' my brother would have never hurt anyone , so it really told me how powerful the feeling was			1
watching her go through it and evolve -- not only was she radiantly happy , but she was completely upfront with it			2
seeing how she handled it -- she would talk about it if people wanted to -- showed me this was meant to be			2
@entity0 : yet , you do candidly write about having unexpected anxiety about the news			0
@entity5 : i was afraid for her			1
i was flabbergasted that this was going on			0
there was shock and apprehension			0
i had been all for more diversity , and challenging binary roles for male and female behavior , but it did n't somehow include my brother changing sexes			1
the one thing is that we are born male or female , and we need those boundaries to rub up against			0
i think one interesting thing a feminist said to me is that i seem to embrace these binary principles in the book			0
i do believe there is such a thing as a male and a female ; we need these dichotomies , like good and evil			0
we make these divides to keep our footing in the world			0
the sex we 're born is not immutable , and that is very hard to grasp			0
you ca n't really call her decision a choice			0
it 's too painful , too perilous , it has to be an urge that we do n't even have a word for			1
@entity0 : what was your takeaway from @entity3 's journey ? @entity5 : i think a lot of people who are transsexual emphasize the strangeness of it all			1
for example , the director of " @entity119 " @entity120 , who is now @entity120 , has this wild red hair			0
my sister is so not like that			0
this book is an attempt to " unweird " the whole subject			0
i think it 's more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal , but i do think we have to remember that it 's not that many people			1
so much changes , but so much does n't change			0
you can take hormones to change this , have surgery to change that , but you ca n't change the voice , the hair , the love -- there is a core of self that does n't change			1
@entity0 : how has it been different to have a sister rather than a brother ? @entity5 : it 's wonderful			1
it 's like i 've gotten two for the price of one			2
we have differences -- it takes so long for her to get dressed ! we 're just much closer than we 've ever been			0
it 's hard to say the change has n't made her happier			2
at first i thought i 'm really losing a brother			2
it was like a grief ; a death			0
but , her happiness is crucial			0
she 's more open , more gregarious			2
i think my mother would 've been very , very upset but , in a funny way , @entity3 is the kind of person my mother wanted @entity8 to be			1
@entity0 : how was it different at age 59 than it might have been earlier ? @entity5 : i think the reason she did n't go through with it before is because there was no acceptance			1
why is so much of this happening now ? because it can			0
there is a word for it and there are people doing it			0
this submerged desire finally had a means of being liberated			0
@entity0 : having @entity3 in your life took some adjusting , even in small areas like the correct language , right ? @entity5 : the first time we went out in public , i was very self - conscious and nervous			1
we went to dinner at an upscale restaurant and the waiter asked how we liked our food			0
i said , " mine is good , but his is fabulous			0
" she ( @entity3 ) smirked and i smirked			1
i would often call her @entity8 by mistake when it was just the two of us			0
and on the phone , the voice is a huge thing that is not improvable			0
there is no good surgery			2
when she gets on the phone , i would see her as @entity8 , my brother			2
recently , though , i 've stopped doing that			0
@entity0 : @entity3 initially did n't want you to write the book , but then she changed her mind			1
why ? @entity5 : she wished she had this book when she was struggling with it			1
i wanted it to be her book as much as my book			0
i think of it as a partnership			0
