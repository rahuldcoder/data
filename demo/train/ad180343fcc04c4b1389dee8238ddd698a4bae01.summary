@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the @entity6 , some of the best music happens miles from the @entity8 , hours after the crowds have gone and the last of the crawfish bread has been consumed			1
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 sport the @entity14 t - shirts as they perform			1
it happens with the arrival of midnite			0
at 1:18 a.m. , @entity11 -- a brass - funk rock band lead by three trombones -- has just finished a 90 - minute set that started with a soulful , passionate original tune written by bandleader @entity11 , and concluded with a cover of @entity23 ' " @entity22 , " complete with the trombones running through wah - wah pedals			1
suddenly the crowd of about 75 clears out of the way as a dozen musicians parade in the room			2
dressed in black shirts , they are the @entity14 , a @entity6 supergroup whose appearance is as infrequent as a lunar eclipse			1
each member of the @entity14 fronts his own band , and the artists are rarely in the city at the same time			1
the band was started by @entity6 drummers and longtime friends @entity14 and @entity43			1
in the weeks following @entity44 , @entity43 had moved into @entity14 's house , where the two hit on an idea			2
" we realized we had never had our own band together , and we decided to invite all of the best horn players we know to play with us , " @entity43 said			2
each artist has a name , printed in red , on his shirt , following the command " listen to " : @entity56 ... @entity57 ... @entity58			0
they 're the band 's predecessors and mentors			2
although probably little known outside the @entity63 , they 're the musicians who shaped @entity0 music : masters of their craft			1
modern - day masters in their own right , the @entity14 live up to their name , splitting the night with their loud , hard , funky jams			1
there are up - and - comers @entity73 and @entity10 , and veterans such as @entity11 from @entity11 , @entity14 and @entity12 from @entity75			2
their black shirts are drenched with sweat by the time they finish playing			0
" its an honor to play with such veterans because it 's confirmation that i 'm doing my thing on a level to where people are noticing the hard work that i have been putting in , " said trumpet player @entity10			0
" playing with this kind of band keeps you on your toes			0
it 's more interesting and challenging to try to understand everyone 's musical approach and find a spot for yours to fit			0
" that 's the beauty of it , " he said			0
" how to sound good , have fun , listen to each other , entertain a crowd , and stay on the same page at the same time			0
it lets me know , if i 'm not there yet , i 'm on my way to being one of the big boys			0
" the @entity14 will be at @entity6 -- of course -- holding down a 5:55 p.m. slot saturday afternoon			1
and then , when it 's over , they 'll be gone -- ready to get together when the moon beckons .			0
