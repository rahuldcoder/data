-- first it was instant messaging during office hours that gave us the thrill of passing notes in class			0
then it was ogling ourselves on web cams , ranting our minds on blogs , uploading our baby photos on @entity13 and poking each other on @entity15			0
these days , as corporate records show , we choose to spend our lunch breaks watching @entity18 , if not chatting over @entity19			0
@entity23 's flagship @entity21 shop stands at the corner of @entity27 's trendy @entity26 district			0
the bad news is the web 2.0 revolution is over			0
the good news is now we can take it with us			0
over the past two years , well over a dozen startups have sprung into action , bringing everything from @entity35 to @entity36 ( @entity36 ) to our mobile phones , in a quest to conquer the cellular fourth screen			1
winner of @entity43 's 2007 @entity42 in the category of @entity45 , @entity40 is confident about the viability of its future : " the next wave of internet growth is mobile			2
the number of mobile devices worldwide has exceeded three billion , and the next billion subscribers will have their first internet experience using a mobile phone			2
" like the @entity56 - based @entity55 , @entity40 also offers instant messaging , photo sharing and @entity36 for cheaper telephony , in addition to social networking via profiles , chatrooms and , of course , friends			1
applications are free to download and communities are free to join , while members are charged only for sms and @entity36 calls , bridging communications between mobile devices and desktop computers			1
the softwares are fully functional on both @entity74 and any smart ( @entity76 - enabled ) 2.5g phones running such platforms as @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity83 nimbuzz in particular boasts compatibility with @entity19 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity15			2
but it is hardly alone in partnering with traditional desktop live chat sites , as well as industry partners around the world			1
playfully packaged , internationally - based @entity96 works with @entity98 providers in @entity99 and @entity100 as well as @entity102 ( @entity102 ) providers based in both @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity99 , @entity105 and @entity106 , also consolidating all chat buddies into a single mobile contact list			2
in this context , one way to stand out from the all - encompassing bunch with the global reach is through niche audience focus			0
@entity114 , a free online language - exchange network that allows members to create profiles and chat with language partners in real time ( text , voice , video ) , will go mobile in the near future			2
@entity125 , an upcoming mobile social networking startup , will focus on connecting social networkers between the world 's two largest online communities -- @entity130 and @entity131 -- in terms of communication , information , culture and e-commerce			1
furthermore , its business model is based on revenue from emerging online advertising , @entity36 calls and premium membership fees , without the mobile ads and viral marketing			1
fierce competition meanwhile in the mobile marketplace , @entity36 competition is getting fierce			1
while @entity147 's open - source @entity147 was heralded by early beta testers as " the first viable @entity19 alternative " in july 2005 , it 's clear today that @entity19 itself is the big winner in the @entity36 game			1
most recently , @entity153 has extended its partnership with @entity19 , following its collaboration with mobile operator 3 for the global launch of the @entity158 in october 2007 , which was the first mass - market @entity19 - enabled handset as a carrier - integrated solution for mobile - voip im services			1
but mobile @entity36 itself still faces multiple challenges , including fragmented access and distribution			1
while some applications choose to collaborate with mobile network carriers , others choose to compete with them by using data networks such as @entity98			1
" in the near future , there will be a hyper - convergence solution , " predicts @entity125 's @entity172			0
" however , @entity98 / @entity176 to cell / @entity35 will be playing a bigger and bigger role			0
in the long run , there will be all - in - ip ims solutions			0
" insecure communications also pose a new threat to @entity36 , as @entity172 points out : " in the early days of @entity36 , people were mostly concerned with its cost , functionality and reliability			1
now that @entity36 is gaining wide acceptance and becoming one of the mainstream communication technologies , security has become a major issue			2
" and to satisfy the @entity18 generation , applications such as @entity195 encourage the circulation of photos and viral videos optimized for mobile viewing in real time , with an all - in - one interface featuring @entity18 , @entity15 , @entity13 , @entity203 podcast , etc , with the possibility to add other community sites such as ifilm and blogger			1
going mobile @entity209 , founder and ceo of @entity211 , a social - networking site specialized in @entity214 fashion avatars , is enthusiastic about going mobile			1
" we have a roadmap to implement our service on mobile platforms such as @entity83 , " he says			1
" today users are already using @entity214 in gaming platforms like the wildly successful @entity221 , so the logical integration of @entity223 into the mobile platform will certainly present a great opportunity			2
" technically , new handsets already integrate hardware acceleration for @entity74 , and battery life is increasing rapidly			0
now the only remaining factor is availability or higher - speed affordable mobile bandwidth , which is already emerging in advanced mobile markets such as @entity233 , @entity27 and @entity234			2
" indeed in @entity27 , where the mobile - phone penetration rate hovers around 150 percent , mastering the mobile market is becoming increasingly lucrative			1
@entity27 's largest mobile network carrier @entity23 introduced @entity131 's first @entity74 video - sharing service in 2005 , launched @entity27 's first @entity239 in 2006 , and partnered with blogging site @entity240 in early 2008			0
from the carrier 's point of view , people 's choice of mobile communication is a question of coverage and user - friendliness -- of " price , packaging , usability , " according to @entity23 's ( " create a @entity253 " ) chief marketing officer @entity254			0
" we try to ' replicate ' any desktop experience to the mobile phone			2
you can call it replicating , extending , adding value , " continues @entity257			0
" and with every new partnership , we need to make sure that the application works on each new handset we launch ... with mobile phones [ as opposed to desktop computers ] there is still some concern , stigma , so we need to educate people to get over that hurdle			1
it 's the faster we can get it at the click of a button			0
" more and more , the mission of the mobile industry is to make seamless that virtual space between desktop and handset			1
" it 's where we want people to embrace life , " says @entity257			0
" it 's what we all aim to do			0
no downtime , no downspace ... over time @entity240 will add more features , and we will mobilize as much as possible			0
" the good news is the @entity291 revolution is only beginning			0
