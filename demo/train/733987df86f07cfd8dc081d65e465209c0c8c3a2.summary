@entity0 -- many of @entity4 's @entity3 are awaiting the election of pope @entity7 's successor with high expectations			1
" we pray for the new pope , " said father @entity9 , a @entity0 priest			1
" we hope he will be spiritual , dynamic and open minded			0
we hope he will be more open to @entity4 , more pragmatic , and someone who understands very well the @entity12			1
" in recent days , father @entity9 , the parish priest of the @entity14 in the northern suburbs of the capital , has been travelling to several @entity4 cities , giving lectures to jam - packed audiences of priests , seminarians and laymen			1
" sometimes the audience is as big as 4,000 people , " he enthused			0
" i talk about religion and church management			0
" @entity4 catholics like @entity9 have long been caught in the middle of a decades - long conflict between @entity4 's @entity30 and the @entity31			1
they are walking a fine line between loyalty to the @entity31 and to their country			0
" of course we believe in one holy , @entity3 and apostolic church , " @entity9 said			1
" we are in total union with the @entity31 in terms of liturgy , theology , holy communion and rites			0
" as a @entity4 priest , we love our country , the motherland			2
we are law - abiding			0
" @entity4 today remains largely atheist under the rule of the @entity30			2
even so , churches like @entity9 's have been attracting old believers and new converts			2
@entity4 's @entity52 says some six million @entity4 @entity3 attend services in government - sanctioned churches , but others practice their faith in secret -- in @entity3 churches outside government control			1
" many of them are still going to the underground churches , " said father @entity9			2
experts say millions worship in underground churches -- so - called " house - churches " that are fiercely loyal to the @entity31 and disagree with government restrictions and periodic crackdowns			1
after the 1949 revolution , the ruling @entity30 denounced religion as the " opiate " of the masses			0
@entity4 cut off ties with the @entity31 in 1951 and the two sides have been estranged ever since			2
religious persecution reached a crescendo during the chaotic @entity79 ( 1966 - 76 ) , when clergy and laymen alike were persecuted , jailed and even killed			0
in the early 1970s , i remember walking by what looked like churches in central @entity0			1
they were padlocked or used as workshops or warehouses			0
a few years after chairman @entity91 's death in 1976 , @entity4 reopened " patriotic churches " where people can practice religion under government control			1
more than thirty years of reform has turned @entity4 into the second biggest economy in the world			2
it also has one of the fastest growing @entity100 communities in the world			0
with less strict adherence to communist ideology , many @entity4 appeared spirtually adrift , looking for a value system on which to anchor their lives as they cope with rampant materialism , money - worship and widespread corruption			1
many turn to religion for solace			0
" they are looking for peace and stability , for spiritual purification , " said father @entity9			0
last autumn , i watched @entity9 preside over an elaborate wedding of 62 couples from across @entity4			2
most were newly married ; others were older couples renewing their vows			0
i asked one groom , a white - collar worker in @entity0 , " why turn @entity3 ? " " religion helps people , young and old , draw a red line between what is moral and proper , and what is not , " he answered			1
@entity9 says local officials approve of religion too because it helps improve social stability			0
" it promotes social harmony , " echoing the @entity4 leadership 's political slogan			1
@entity4 says citizens now enjoy religious freedom , as enshrined in the constitution -- but it comes with caveats			2
the regulations , @entity141 notes , require that religious organizations and believers must " safeguard the nation 's unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability " and eschew " foreign domination			0
" religious activities should observe the constitution , laws and regulations , and safeguard the nation 's unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability			0
no organizations or individuals should interfere with the state 's administration , the judiciary , or education			0
international rights groups complain that @entity4 officials continue to detain religious believers , close religious sites , and impose arbitrary restrictions			2
over the past eight years during @entity169 @entity7 's papacy , the two sides have made attempts to break the impasse but only with modest success			0
in 2005 , pope @entity7 met with members of the @entity176 's @entity175 who were touring @entity177 at the time			2
in a pastoral letter issued on may 20 , 2007 , the pope expressed understanding about the complicated situation of the church in @entity4 and offered guidelines for pastoral life			1
he expressed a " willingness to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue " with @entity4 , while calling for defense of the doctrines and tradition of the @entity3			1
the pope , in the letter , also dedicated may 24 as a day of prayer for the church in @entity4 - and in the same year set up a special commission on affairs related to the church in the country			1
in 2008 , the @entity199 and the @entity200 visited the @entity31 and performed in front of the pope			0
it was hailed as an ice - breaking event			0
still , major sticking points remain			0
while @entity4 may allow @entity4 catholics to practice their faith and accept the pope 's spiritual leadership , it also tells the @entity31 not to " interfere in @entity4 's internal affairs , " including the matter of ordaining @entity4 bishops			1
@entity4 in recent years has ordained new bishops without the pope 's approval , stalling efforts of restoring diplomatic relations between @entity4 and the @entity31			1
many local @entity3 , caught in the middle , say they hope the government will respect the universal traditions of the @entity31			1
at the same time , they hope the @entity31 can better understand the church in @entity4 and reach reconciliation with @entity0			1
" we follow @entity4 and we also follow the @entity3 way , " said father @entity9 , who for years attended an underground church before joining the mainstream " patriotic church			1
" but no breakthroughs are expected any time soon			0
the incoming pope will have little room to tweak the " ambiguous but still conservative line " pursued by @entity7 because the hardliners in the @entity31 are simply too strong , said one analyst who spoke to @entity1 on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding religious issues in @entity4			1
if the new pope takes a more conciliatory line on @entity4 , he added , his credibility could be questioned by the hardliners			2
@entity4 communist leaders , on the other hand , are still struggling with how to deal with this unpredictable religious boom .			0

@entity3 and government authorities *uneasily* *coexist* in @entity4
more than six million @entity3 attend government - sanctioned churches
experts say millions more practice @entity252 in underground " house - churches "
@entity4 @entity3 hope the next pope can reconcile church 's differences with @entity0
