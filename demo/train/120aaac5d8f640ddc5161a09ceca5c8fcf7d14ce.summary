-- @entity4 president @entity3 should leave office during the investigation into whether he was connected to three recent slayings , his 2007 presidential opponent said thursday			1
@entity4 president @entity3 has said he has no intention of giving up power over the slayings inquiry			1
retired gen. @entity11 , who lost to @entity12 in a runoff , said @entity4 is suffering its worst crisis since the democratic process began in 1985 after years of civil war			1
demonstrations will continue and anger will mount unless @entity3 temporarily steps out of the way to allow an unblemished probe , he said			0
" we want an impartial investigation , a transparent investigation , " @entity21 told @entity0			0
" the president must leave his post			1
" the crisis started monday with the surfacing of a video in which @entity4 attorney @entity29 said @entity3 , the president 's wife and a top aide would be responsible if something happened to the lawyer			1
@entity29 was gunned down sunday while riding his bike in @entity36			1
he had recorded the video last week			1
@entity29 was being threatened with death , he said , because he had blamed @entity3 and his associates for the april slayings of a prominent businessman and his daughter			1
@entity29 had represented the businessman			0
they were killed , @entity29 said , because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted			1
" it 's the time - honored tradition in @entity4 that if someone gets in your way , there 's likely to be a violent outcome , " said @entity48 , the @entity49 ambassador to @entity4 from 1996 to 1999			1
@entity3 took to the airwaves monday night to vehemently deny that he , his wife or the aide had any connection to the slayings			1
he promised a full investigation and said he would accept international help , asking the @entity63 to become involved			0
a @entity4 newspaper reported thursday that an @entity63 agent had arrived in the country in connection with the investigation			1
but @entity29 supporters say they do n't believe the @entity4 government can carry out an impartial and thorough investigation and want @entity3 out			1
@entity21 said vice president @entity72 could take over until the investigation is complete			1
" we are only asking that the state be strengthened , " @entity21 said			0
" if he does n't do this , we believe the situation will get worse			0
" @entity3 said in an interview tuesday night with @entity79 that he has no intention of resigning or otherwise giving up power			0
he blamed the deaths on unnamed people who want to bring down his government			1
" it is evident that [ @entity29 's video statement ] was written by someone who has been in on this plan to destabilize the government and for reasons that i do n't know , because i do n't know why mr. @entity29 mentions us in that video , " @entity3 said			1
for @entity21 and other critics , that 's not good enough			2
" the president has not wanted to confront this and has given evasive answers , " @entity21 said			2

" it 's a very worrisome situation , " said @entity48 , the former @entity49 ambassador			2
" the country is in very serious trouble			0
" there were rumors two to three weeks ago that the military might stage a coup , @entity48 said			0
" the security situation is out of control , " he added			0
@entity114 , a @entity115 analyst with the @entity117 consulting firm , calls it " a major political scandal			0
" @entity120 , director of the @entity121 , a @entity122 policy institute , agrees with that assessment			0
" it 's very damning for the president			1
very damning , " he said			0
@entity127 , a fiscal analyst and executive director of the @entity130 , said the upheaval could further tear apart a poverty - ridden nation trying to heal from a deadly civil war			0
the three recently slain @entity4 -- @entity29 , businessman @entity134 and his daughter -- came from the upper economic class			1
as a result , @entity137 said , many wealthy @entity4 are being " radicalized " against the government			1
likewise , he said , many poor and disenfranchised @entity4 also are becoming radicalized and are rallying behind @entity3 and the government			1
" i fear that this crisis will lead to violence and destabilization of the government , " @entity137 said from @entity36			2
" we all want justice			0
" @entity148 , a @entity4 who has lived in the @entity49 for seven years , rejects what he says are efforts to forge a class divide			1
" the powers that be are trying to make it a social issue -- the wealthy against the poor , " he said			0
" this is not a social issue			0
this is @entity4 are fed up			1
" @entity148 has personal connections with some of the key actors in the crisis			0
@entity29 was his wife 's law professor at @entity164 , @entity148 said			2
and he said he went to high school with @entity166 , the presidential aide @entity29 mentioned in the video			1
in his conversations with friends in @entity4 , @entity148 said , he sensed " a sense of desperation , of hopelessness			1
" he believes people are fed up			2
" they 're saying , ' ok			0
let 's not let this happen again and again and again , ' " he said			2
@entity137 , the fiscal analyst , holds out hope			0
the investigation , he said , will be handled by an independent attorney general who does not report to the president			2
and the probe will be conducted under the watchful eye of a @entity188 - @entity4 commission set up to investigate corruption and political violence			1
" that gives me more confidence , " he said			0
but @entity21 and others note that the attorney general , @entity196 , met privately with @entity3 on tuesday morning , the day after the scandal broke			0
the meeting was not disclosed until reporters uncovered it and questioned @entity199 on his way out			0
@entity3 's critics accuse the president of already meddling in the investigation			1
@entity3 and @entity199 said the meeting had been planned days ahead of time			0
" there is no interference in the investigation , " @entity199 told reporters afterward			0
@entity4 has " a culture of corruption , " said @entity48 , the former @entity49 envoy			1
a just investigation is necessary , he said			0
" until they fix it , they will limp along -- and that 's the good scenario , " he said			2
" they are in serious danger of becoming a failed state , if they 're not already			0
nobody is punished for anything			0
" @entity29 said the same thing in the video , bemoaning the " narcos , assassins and thieves " who have taken over the country			2

" they kill people like dogs			2
" the lawyer 's niece , @entity235 , said her uncle learned to accept his fate			1
" he had many threats , " she told @entity0 en @entity240 , " and when he saw it was inevitable , he taped a video			2
