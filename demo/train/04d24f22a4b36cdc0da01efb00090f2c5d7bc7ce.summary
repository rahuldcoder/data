@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 announced what he called a " meaningful and unprecedented " climate change deal with @entity6 and other key nations that was expected to be sealed before the president headed home from the @entity10 late friday			1
" for the first time in history , all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change , " @entity3 told reporters			1
the president said he met with leaders from @entity20 , @entity6 , @entity21 and @entity22 , and " that 's where we agreed ... to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees @entity27			1
" it 's a nonbinding goal , and the emissions targets " will not be by themselves sufficient to get to where we need to get by 2050 , " @entity3 said			1
however , he added that it is a first step , and that for many countries " this is going to be the first time in which even voluntary they offered up mitigation targets			0
" " i think that it was important to essentially get that shift in orientation moving , " @entity3 said			0
the president said he believes it 's necessary that the countries get to a legally binding treaty , but said , " if we just waited for that , we would not make any progress			0
" earlier , a senior @entity3 administration official said , " no country is entirely satisfied with each element but this is a meaningful and historic step forward and a foundation from which to make further progress			2
we thank the emerging economies for their voluntary actions and especially appreciate the work and leadership of the @entity58 in this effort			0
" critics of the @entity61 have said that without specific commitments from the leaders to actually cut carbon emissions it would be difficult to reach any target			2
the deal calls on nations to submit their " concrete commitments " into an appendix attached to the agreement to specifically lay out each country 's intentions for climate change , @entity3 said			1
those commitments will be subjected to an international " consultation and analysis " that will help foster accountability among the nations			0
" it will not be legally binding , but what it will do is allow for each country to show to the world what they 're doing , " @entity3 said , " and there will be a sense on the part of each country that we 're in this together , and we 'll know who is meeting and who is not meeting , the mutual obligations that have been set forth			2
" another senior administration official had said the precise details of the agreement were still in some flux , so it was unclear whether the final version would include language that was in earlier drafts aimed at forcing nations to set legally binding targets for reducing emissions			2
the president worked behind the scenes on getting a vote among key nations -- including @entity6 and @entity20 -- to approve the agreement before taking it to the wider group for a vote , according to the official			1
the first official added @entity3 would leave @entity0 shortly after addressing the media about the tentative deal in order to return to @entity118 before a major snowstorm hits			0
