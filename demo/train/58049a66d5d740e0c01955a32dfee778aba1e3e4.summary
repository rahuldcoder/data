-- @entity2 's growing economies should put jobs creation at the heart of their development policies , according to the head of the @entity7			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity9 , @entity8 said that youth unemployment is one of the biggest challenges facing @entity2 's countries			1
" there is a vibrant youth that is expecting the leadership of those countries to actually open the economy so that they can actually express their talent and find ways to get integrated in the job market , " she said			0
according to the @entity7 chief , a major re-engineering is currently taking place between the developed and developing world economies -- a number of @entity2 countries have enjoyed higher growth rates than @entity32 and the @entity33 in recent times as many western nations remains mired in financial turmoil			1
" emerging markets are playing a role that is much bigger , much more important in terms of leadership than they did , say , 10 , 15 years ago , " she says			0
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : more than ever the @entity43 crisis has put it to @entity2 leaders that they have to look @entity45			1
how significant is that ? @entity8 : all countries are interconnected			0
there is no question that a crisis in one particular part of the world is going to affect those countries , but also all of the countries , especially if there 's a large volume of trade between those countries			2
four reasons @entity2 is rising when i look at @entity2 , i know there is about 30 % of trade going to @entity32 , so if something goes wrong in @entity32 it will have an effect on @entity2 which is why any solution will require the cooperation of all players and i understand perfectly that @entity2 authorities are concerned about the way the @entity32 are dealing with their crisis and are trying to address solutions			2
@entity0 : many people here have watched with fascination how @entity76 has turned to @entity77 for some sort of financial help			0
do you see this shifting perhaps the power relations on a global scale ? @entity83 : there is at the moment a major re-engineering between advanced economies , emerging markets , developing countries and clearly emerging markets are playing a role that is much bigger , much more important in terms of leadership than they did , say , 10 , 15 years ago			2
so there is a re-organization happening as we speak , which is good in the main , because there were massive imbalances and those imbalances are not good for the global economy , but it is difficult and it 's a transition phase that is complicated to deal with			0
@entity0 : do @entity2 economies have a role to play that 's positive ? is there something to be learned from @entity2 economies over this ? @entity83 : well , first of all , the @entity2 continent in and of itself has had a growth rate that was significantly higher than that of @entity32 , than that of the @entity33 , lower than some of the big emerging markets such as @entity114 , @entity115 or @entity116 , but in the range of 6 % lately			1
i think that 's one reason to be optimistic about @entity2			2
@entity2 growth ? it 's complicated the second reason to be optimistic about @entity2 is that it holds significant commodities , raw materials that are so needed for the growth of other countries -- if you look at the volume of trade between , say , @entity114 and some @entity2 countries such as @entity2 , or the volume of trade amongst @entity2 countries in terms of intra-regional trade , that is growing as well			2
so those are alternatives sources of growth that differ from the traditional trade links with , say , @entity32 and these are new opportunities for @entity2 countries to actually develop and strengthen			0
@entity0 : what are the warning signs and concerns about @entity2 economies ? what are the critical issues for you ? @entity83 : the first message that i gave to both the @entity151 , the @entity152 and the @entity2 authorities is to rebuild the buffers that had been used during the financial crisis wherever they could to have reserves available and be able to either use fiscal policy or monetary policy to make sure that growth is maintained and is sustainable			1
@entity2 's 2020 growth vision the second message is make sure that the growth that you encourage , by whichever ways are available to you , it 's a growth that is inclusive , that is creating jobs , because jobs are really at the heart of any development policies at the moment in @entity2 , but in other countries as well			1
@entity0 : easy to say that			0
@entity83 : yes , i know , but it 's a question of identifying for each and every country , what are the impediments to job creation ? what are the impediments to growth ? and whether it 's the infrastructure projects that need to be financed , that need to be developed , that need to be monitored , whether it 's education and vocational training programs that need to be put in place			1
that is going to be different , whether you 're in @entity151 , whether you 're in @entity2 , whether you 're in @entity191 , but in all places there is a vibrant youth that is expecting the leadership of those countries to actually open the economy so that they can actually express their talent and find ways to get integrated in the job market .			0
