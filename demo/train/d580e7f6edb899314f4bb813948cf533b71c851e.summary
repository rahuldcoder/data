@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 officials engaged in last - minute shuttle diplomacy with their restive neighbor @entity6 and repeated calls for restraint ahead of what is expected to be another violent day of protests across the @entity12 nation on friday			1
@entity0 's @entity13 met on thursday in @entity14 to specifically address the increasingly bloody crisis , which some analysts fear could spill over to the @entity0 side of the border			2
the council issued a statement calling for @entity6 security forces to act with restraint and for the government to implement swift reforms to satisfy demonstrators			2
" it is important that necessary steps are taken rapidly and in a determined way in order to establish social peace and stability in brotherly , friendly @entity6 , to put an end to the violence and to maintain security of life , basic rights and freedoms , " the council announced			2
also , the head of @entity0 's national intelligence agency , the @entity40 , traveled to @entity41 on thursday for high - level talks			2
the wave of unrest that has swept across the @entity12 world this year surprised the @entity0 government as it was dramatically expanding ties with its @entity12 neighbors			1
@entity6 has perhaps been the greatest beneficiary of what the @entity0 government calls its " @entity53 " foreign policy initiative with @entity0 's neighbors			1
in the late 1990s , @entity6 and @entity0 were on the brink of war because of @entity6 support for @entity58 rebels battling the @entity0 state			1
but in recent years , @entity0 prime minister @entity60 and @entity6 president @entity61 have become close political allies			1
the two leaders have vacationed together with their wives along the @entity0 coast			1
and last year , @entity60 lifted visa restrictions on @entity6 visitors and announced @entity6 should treat @entity0 as their " second home			1
" when pro-democracy protests erupted in @entity71 , @entity60 was swift to call for embattled @entity71 president @entity72 to listen to the voices of his people and step down			2
but @entity60 has been much more restrained about criticizing @entity61 , even as @entity6 tanks encircled the rebellious southern town of @entity77 and more than 400 demonstrators were killed across the country in the growing government crackdown			1
" @entity0 has to reckon that in some cases of the @entity85 , it just may be on the wrong side of history , " wrote @entity0 expert @entity81 , in an article released this week by the @entity83			2
" as much as @entity0 thought it was on the side of change , it has become a status quo power ... with its own vested interests , commercial concerns , and close ties with regimes			0
" as the death toll mounts in @entity6 , a growing number of voices in @entity0 newspapers normally sympathetic to the @entity60 government have been calling for @entity0 to re-evaluate its cozy relationship with the @entity61 regime			1
" ' zero problems ' with neighbors who know how to kill , " wrote @entity102 in the pro-government @entity104 newspaper this week			0
" @entity14 should not resort to double standards when it comes to autocratic regimes in the @entity113 killing their own people , " wrote columnist @entity108 in the same newspaper			0
@entity0 has also come under fire in @entity116 from rebels who have accused @entity14 of supporting the @entity119 regime in @entity120			0
last year , @entity60 received a human rights prize from @entity119 , and earlier this month , the @entity116 opposition movement refused to allow a @entity0 ship to dock in the rebel stronghold of @entity125			1
demonstrators also staged a protest outside the @entity0 consulate in @entity125			0
the escalating @entity6 conflict may not only embarrass the @entity0 government ; some analysts warn it could destabilize @entity0			1
experts point to @entity134 's crackdown on rebellious @entity135 in northern @entity136 in 1991 , which resulted in a flood of refugees spilling over the @entity0 border			0
over the past two years , much smaller numbers of refugees fled to @entity0 to escape the crushing of pro-democracy protests in @entity143 -- another authoritarian neighbor that enjoys booming economic ties with @entity0			0
so far , @entity0 officials say they have not seen an increase in the number of @entity6 fleeing government persecution			1
but officials are clearly worried about this possibility			0
" you have to think of all kinds of scenarios , " said @entity151 , undersecretary of @entity0 's @entity152 , in a phone interview with @entity2			0
" people have asked if we are our reassessing our visa policy [ with @entity6 ]			0
and we 're not , " @entity151 said			0
instead , @entity151 said @entity0 's intelligence chief traveled to @entity41 on thursday leading a delegation that is offering to advise the @entity61 regime on how to implement reforms aimed at satisfying the growing protest movement			2
" they were going to talk about public administration , how to reform it economically and politically , " @entity151 said			0
" all this has to be done as quickly as possible so people can feel the changes			0
