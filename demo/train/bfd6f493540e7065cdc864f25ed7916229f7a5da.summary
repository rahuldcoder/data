in a statement , the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , said that @entity3 made the decision to retire from @entity20 " in order to concentrate " on one - day and @entity23 cricket			1

the wicket - keeper batsman missed five one - day games against @entity46 in november after suffering a hand injury , the same problem which forced him out of the opening test against @entity13 earlier this month			1

trailing 2 - 0 in the four match series , @entity2 required victory in @entity14 to keep the series alive			2
the draw meant that it was unable to overturn the deficit and slumped to yet another overseas defeat -- a recurring theme during @entity3 's reign			2

he enjoyed a hugely successful start to his reign , losing just one of 13 @entity20 series and winning eight			0
that run allowed @entity2 to top the world rankings towards the end of 2009 , a position in which it remained until 2011			0
but @entity2 has struggled for success outside of its own country in the test match arena in recent times			0
this latest defeat by @entity13 comes on the back of similar results in @entity108 , @entity61 and @entity109			0
last august , @entity3 hinted he may leave his role as captain after his side 's 3 - 1 @entity113 defeat by @entity108			1
