-- just a year or so ago , girls behaving '' badly '' — really raunchy , really messed up on drugs , really promiscuous and narcissistic — seemed to be a revolutionary flavor in movie comedy			1
to see how quickly it 's become the new normal , check out two current high - profile indie comedies			1
" @entity7 " follows a bride - to - be and her three friends over the course of one endless , drunken , hapless bachelorette party			1
the movie would like to be " bridesmaids " meets " @entity16 " meets a very special episode of " @entity15			2
" " for a @entity17 , call ... " tells the tender tale of two roommates who team up to launch a phone - sex line			1
whatever their virtues or flaws , each of these movies makes the dirtiest episode of " @entity30 " look like @entity29 fluff			0
" @entity7 , " a sloshed - night - before - the - wedding comedy , is a movie that 's every bit as caustic and high - strung as its damaged - princess heroines			1
it opens in @entity37 , where the sweet plus - size @entity38 ( @entity39 , who was @entity42 's @entity41 freak of a roommate in bridesmaids ) informs her best friend , the platinum - blond ice queen @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , that she 's engaged , an announcement that @entity46 greets by just about choking on her salad with jealousy			2
that 's what a petty vixen she is			0
most of " @entity7 " takes place six months later , in @entity55 , on the eve of @entity38 's nuptials , the perfect occasion for a bachelorette party that spins out of control			1
but this is n't a daffy clockwork farce like the @entity64 films			0
it 's a revved - up pageant of naked feminine dysfunction , a comedy of values about young women who do n't have any			1
@entity70 : watching stars watch ' @entity72 ' @entity46 , the maid of honor , is joined by @entity38 's two other childhood friends : @entity76 ( @entity75 ) , a gothy motormouthed train wreck , and @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , a terminally insecure ditz			2
these two spend the movie snorting enough cocaine to give an elephant a heart attack			0
as for @entity46 , she does n't need drugs — she gets high on hating others , and on hating herself , too			0
the entire movie is an overdose of wrecked party - girl masochism			1
the three bridesmaids end up tearing @entity38 's humongous wedding dress asunder , and so they go out on the town , dragging the increasingly sorry garment around with them , trying to find a way to repair it even as it 's assaulted by various bodily fluids			2
" @entity7 " is expertly shot and paced , with a script that 's as cutting as a serrated knife			1
it was written by its director , @entity99 ( who based it on her @entity101 play ) , and her dialogue has a nasty misanthropic zing that ups the ante on " @entity106 " and " heathers			0
" each of the trio has a guy she 's passively pursuing ( they 're played by @entity113 , @entity114 , and the always droll @entity115 ) , and the encounters with them are funny in a merciless , this - is - a - woman 's - brain - on - drugs sort of way			2
there 's a rush in seeing actresses this charming take on characters who are this disagreeable			0
yet if " @entity7 " takes the form of a romantic ensemble comedy , it 's purged of any true romantic feeling			1
you 'll laugh , maybe a lot , but you wo n't feel great about it in the morning			0
' @entity133 ' : watch @entity135 trailer where the characters in " @entity7 " seem to be pining for an innocence they never had , the two heroines of " for a @entity138 ... " manage to outdo them in raunch and still come off as sweetly ingenuous			1
the movie , directed by @entity144 , is crudely shot and about as thin as a mediocre sitcom , yet its central situation is disarmingly funny — and , after a while , oddly winning			0
@entity149 ( @entity148 ) , laid off from her publishing job , moves in with @entity78 ( @entity151 ) , a distant acquaintance she has despised since college ( the feeling is mutual )			0
neither one of them can really afford to live in @entity155 on her own			0
@entity78 , like the @entity157 character on @entity159 's " girls , " calls herself a '' writer , '' but she pays the rent by working for a phone - sex service , and that 's something she 's got a gift for			1
it 's @entity149 who gets the idea of starting their own dirty - talk line			1
this is basically the kickoff for a high - concept farce , but it 's not just the matter - of - fact explicitness that 's funny			2
it 's the way that talking like lusty '' tramps '' on the phone liberates these two			2
@entity148 ( who co-wrote the script ) has a demure sneakiness , but it 's @entity151 's movie — she 's like @entity180 possessed by the spirit of @entity182			0
and all the better off for it			0
