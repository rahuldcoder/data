-- what authorities are calling @entity4 's campaign of guerrilla warfare against his former comrades in the @entity7 has its roots in a hotel lobby in @entity10 , the city 's port district			1
in july 2007 , the former @entity13 officer was an @entity7 probationary officer , riding patrol with a veteran of the force , when they were dispatched to check out a report of a disturbance at the @entity20			1
a man had refused to leave the premises and was sitting on the bench outside the lobby when they arrived			0
@entity26 had " a glazed look in his eyes , " court documents later recounted , and he refused to get up and speak with police			0
@entity4 and his training officer , @entity31 , started to take him into custody , but he refused to comply and took a swing at them			1
@entity26 's family later told investigators he had a history of mental illness			0
@entity4 wrestled with him , and the two tumbled into a planter in front of the @entity20			1
@entity42 readied a taser and warned the man to stop			2
he submitted only after she shocked him with the electronic device			0
that 's where the stories start to differ			0
and those differences led to an investigation by the @entity7 's internal affairs unit , @entity4 's eventual dismissal from the force and a long court battle to clear his name -- a battle he was losing in @entity59 courts			1
timeline in manhunt for former @entity63 cop the @entity7 now says @entity4 is the subject of a massive manhunt			1
it accuses him of killing one police officer and wounding two others , as well as killing the daughter of his police union representative and her fiance on sunday			2
in a letter addressed to " @entity72 " and provided to @entity0 by an @entity7 source , @entity4 threatens to retaliate against officers involved in his case and their families			1
" the attacks will stop when the department states the truth about my innocence , " he wrote			1
two weeks after that encounter in @entity10 , @entity4 went to a sergeant to report that @entity42 had kicked @entity26 after he had given up			1
the @entity7 investigated his complaint and ruled it " unfounded , " based on accounts by three hotel employees , in may 2008			1
then the investigators ' report turns to @entity4			2
" the delay in reporting the alleged misconduct coupled with the witness ' statements irreparably destroy @entity4 's credibility , and bring into question his suitability for continued employment as a police officer , " it states			1
the report found @entity4 had made false statements to a superior while reporting the allegation that @entity42 had kicked the suspect and to internal affairs investigators looking into the claim			1
the report recommended his dismissal , a process that was finalized after a hearing of the department 's board of rights in january 2009			1
he sued to have the decision reversed , calling the process a " witch hunt , " but lost at the trial court and in a state appellate court			0
@entity4 argued that the board had ignored evidence from both @entity26 and his father , who recounted that his son said at the time that he 'd been kicked			1
alleged cop - killer details threats to @entity7 , why he was driven to violence but @entity26 's father 's statements conflicted with his son 's , and @entity26 's mental illness " affected his ability to give an accurate account of the incident , " as the @entity128 put it in october 2011			2
meanwhile , the board found that @entity4 may have had a motive to make a bogus complaint : @entity42 testified that @entity4 " was going to receive an unsatisfactory probationary rating if he did not improve his performance , " and the kicks were reported the day after @entity4 received an evaluation			1
in his letter , @entity4 lashes out against the @entity7 's history of scandal , writing that things have n't " changed since the @entity139 and @entity140 days			1
" " i know i will be villified by the @entity7 and the media , " he wrote			1
" unfortunately , this is a necessary evil that i do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the @entity7 and reclaim my name			2
" but @entity7 chief @entity147 told reporters thursday afternoon that no apology and exoneration would be forthcoming : " it is not going to happen			2
" @entity4 grew up in southern @entity59 and went to high school in the @entity63 suburb of @entity154 , where his mother still lives			2
a police officer told reporters gathered outside the tan stucco home thursday afternoon that @entity4 's mother had requested they stop knocking on her door			1
next - door neighbor @entity162 called him " a nice , friendly guy , easy to approach			0
" " it 's a big shock when we heard it , " she said			0
" we all could n't believe it			0
we did n't know him that well , but he seemed like a really nice guy			0
" while in high school , he played football and was part of the police explorer program , said another neighbor , city councilman @entity174			0
mood ' tense ' among officers he went to college at @entity178 , where he was a running back on the school 's football team and graduated with a degree in political science in 2001 , @entity180 athletic department spokesman @entity179 said			0
" @entity4 is the last person i would ever think would do such , " @entity179 said thursday			2
" he was a great kid			0
" college classmate @entity186 said @entity4 called him " @entity188 " four years ago , after not having spoken for several years after graduation			2
he complained about problems with the @entity7 during the call , but @entity186 did n't recall the details			2
" he did seem to be bothered by it or upset by it a bit , but certainly nothing that he said to me struck me as being a concern other than for concern for his employment , " @entity186 told @entity0			0
he described @entity198 as " a perfectly rational human being , " " smart and insightful			0
" " @entity201 anything that i experienced in a million years would lead me to conclude that this horrendous activity that he engaged in at this point was ever imminent or would ever be any type of concern , " he added			0
@entity4 joined the @entity13 after college , receiving a commission as an ensign in july 2002			2
he trained in river - warfare units and and served a 2006 - 2007 stint in @entity212 guarding oil platforms , according to @entity215 records			0
he held a commission as a lieutenant until february 1 and was rated as a rifle marksman and pistol expert , according to the records			0
he enrolled in the @entity221 in february 2005 and spent four months on the streets as a trainee before being recalled to active duty for his stint in @entity212 , police records state			0
in the end , the @entity7 cost him not only his police job but his career in the @entity13 , he wrote			1
" this is my last resort , " he wrote			0
" the @entity7 has suppressed the truth , and it has now led to deadly consequences			1
" @entity0 's @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
