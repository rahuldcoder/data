-- in a world of politicians who memorize sound bites and regurgitate them like robots , @entity1 is different			1
@entity1 says it as he sees it			1
and , yes , that philosophy can lead to a few gaffes			0
ok , in @entity1 's case , a lot of gaffes			1
but that 's the risk with being real			0
maybe @entity1 is n't always " presidential " as that word has come to be defined , but is n't it about time we revised the definition of that word ? sadly , it has come to mean a staid , reserved person who shows almost no emotion -- almost like @entity22 from " @entity23			1
" but presidents and vice presidents are still human beings and should be allowed and encouraged to act like it			0
look at @entity1 at thursday night 's vice-presidential debate : he laughed , he almost cried , he got angry , he looked to the heavens , he laughed some more			1
@entity1 gave us a veritable one - man show			1
it was a tour de force			0
after @entity1 retires from politics , he should seriously consider touring the nation with a show : " @entity35 " or " say it ai n't so , @entity1			1
" opinion roundup : @entity38 , wonky @entity39 @entity40 may now be finally learning how to " let @entity40 be @entity40 , " but that has never been @entity1 's problem			1
@entity1 wears @entity1 on his sleeve			1
@entity1 is a mix of @entity45 and @entity46			2
he 's warm and relatable like @entity45 , but also you get a sense of unpredictability as we did when watching @entity46 at the @entity51			0
( my dream debate is @entity1 versus @entity46			1
add the empty chair and you have the makings of a hit reality show			2
) debate coach : it 's the @entity60 show ! there has been a lot written about whether @entity1 went too far at the debate			1
did he laugh too much ? was he too impassioned ? too animated ? ( one of my favorite moments occurred early in the debate when @entity39 was answering a question and @entity1 turned to the camera a la " @entity70 " and gave us a look of : " you 've got to be kidding me			1
" ) but does anyone doubt that those were organic reactions by @entity1 ? people can debate all day whether @entity1 should have reined in his feelings , but those were his true emotions			1
@entity40 hammers @entity1 on @entity80 remark instead of media pundits and the public attacking people like @entity1 when they show honest emotion , we should applaud it			1
in fact , we should demand it from all of our presidential candidates			2
there should be one presidential debate that is not about the dry figures of deficit reduction or oil company subsidies , etc. , but about heart			2
@entity96 : partisans are fired up on both sides we need a debate that that reveals who they really are beneath their expensive suits with the @entity104 flag pins on their lapels			0
questions that raise issues that are n't black and white , but hundreds of shades of gray			0
such as , what would you to say to the parents of a child who was killed in a war that you pushed for ? what do you tell a family that is scraping by to make ends meet about why you think millionaires should n't have to pay slightly higher taxes ? what would you say to a young woman who does n't want to have an abortion , but you are advocating cutting the government funding that she needs to raise her child ? opinion : like a father - son brawl how would @entity40 or president @entity129 do in response to those type of questions ? probably ok			0
@entity129 would be law professoresque but trying to fake some emotion			0
@entity40 would give us a memorized answer that has been sanitized by consultants after a gaggle of focus groups			0
neither horrible , yet neither compelling			0
but there is no doubt that @entity1 would be the big winner			2
look , if you want " candidate - enstein " or " @entity144 , " a creature designed by high - priced political consultants from the spare parts of past political campaigns , be my guest			0
there are boatloads of them			0
but there 's only one @entity1			2
and that is truly a shame			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity159 : @entity1 *displayed* full range of emotions , expressions in debate
he says @entity1 is one of the few authentic personalities in our political world
@entity159 : we should encourage candidates to show us who they really are
