-- one day before convicted school shooter @entity4 jumped a fence and fled an @entity8 prison , staff at that prison segregated an inmate and warned officials about an escape plot there , the head of the prison guards ' union said friday			1
@entity15 , the president of the @entity16 , told @entity0 the segregated inmate was not @entity4 , the 19 - year - old who killed three students at a high school cafeteria east of @entity21 in 2012			2
@entity15 could not say if the segregated inmate was one of the other two prisoners who escaped with @entity23 from the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity8 , on thursday night			1
what @entity15 did say is the inmate was segregated wednesday and that prison staff filed documentation that day about the escape plan			1
a union spokeswoman provided @entity0 with a copy of that report friday night			0
it read : " ( a corrections ) officer ... was approached in the @entity37 cafe by an inmate who wanted to advise me that ( another ) inmate ... had told him that he was planning on escaping and finding ( a corrections officer ) and killing her			2
i immediately reported this to @entity43			0
" @entity44 , the union spokeswoman , acknowledged that the inmate who allegedly was planning to escape was segregated at the request of a corrections officer			2
no one has tied this reported plot to the escape of @entity23 and the two others			1
" we are not making that direct link , " @entity44 said			1
" but we do think more precautions should have been made			0
" the @entity56 is looking into this report , department spokesman @entity55 said friday			0
all three escapees are now back in custody			0
@entity23 was found outside a church 100 yards away from the prison shortly after 1 a.m. friday			1
@entity23 has never explained his motive for the february 27 , 2012 attack in which he entered the cafeteria with a .22 - caliber gun and randomly started shooting , killing three students			0
convicted school shooter back in custody still , while the manhunt is over , the fact that @entity23 and the others managed to escape has stirred big questions			2
some wonder why @entity23 was n't in the maximum - security part of the prison , even though he was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the @entity4 -- an incident for which he 's never shown remorse			1
" that is something we have to sit down and take a look at , " warden @entity82 said			0
@entity8 's @entity87 , which evaluates the state 's correctional facilities and reports to the legislature , most recently reported on the @entity24 last april			2
it found " ongoing concern regarding the @entity97 , " while also noting there has been improvement in that unit and " fewer security management concerns			0
" their overall rating for the facility was " good " -- the second best grade out of four			0
@entity8 school shooter shows no remorse at sentencing @entity0 's @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 contributed to this report .			1
