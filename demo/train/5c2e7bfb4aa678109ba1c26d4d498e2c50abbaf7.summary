a special team of hotshot @entity3 restorers has dealt a blow against an evil sinkhole that desecrated the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
this week @entity10 and @entity11 unveiled the 2009 @entity12 -- the first of three damaged cars that will be restored from a disaster that stunned @entity3 fans around the world			1
remember ? back in february , a freakish sinkhole appeared inside the museum , swallowing eight beautiful machines with an estimated value at about $ 1 million , the museum said			1
when the cars were hauled out of the hole , only three were deemed unscathed enough for restoration			0
hey , this is a big deal			0
experts call the @entity3 the most collected car in @entity29			1
@entity10 says it 's the " world 's longest - running , continuously produced passenger car			1
" the @entity12 is no ordinary @entity3			1
even though it 's only 5 years old , it 's been dubbed a " supercar " and " legendary " with a top speed of more than 200 mph			2
the sleek demon went on display for the first time on monday during a ceremony at the big @entity39 show in @entity40			1
it 's not often car restorers get a chance to rescue a vehicle this special			2
this job was handled by a 10 - member team with a less - than - sexy handle : @entity49 -- @entity50			0
" we need to come up with a better name -- like the @entity54 ! " laughed @entity10 spokesman @entity51			1
it may feel like a big win for the @entity57 against the forces of nature -- but now may be a bit too soon to crow about it			0
" that car really had very little damage done to it , compared to all the other cars in the sinkhole			2
it was a relatively easy restoration , " @entity51 said			0
that news will please @entity1 commenters who joked that the damage to the cars could be " buffed out " -- as easily as paint scratches			0
the biggest challenge , he acknowledged , will be the 1 @entity3 , the 1992 convertible which was the millionth ' @entity75 to come off the assembly line			1
fixing a hole but what about that hole ? this coming monday , work is set to begin to fill the 30 - foot - deep sinkhole which ruined the museum 's bright yellow , red - spired @entity83			1
estimated cost of the eight - month project : $ 3.2 million			1
" they 'll be bringing in equipment and moving cars out of the room , before they start work on the sinkhole , " said museum spokeswoman @entity86			1
the museum had initially considered leaving the hole unfilled as a permanent display -- perhaps because the disaster has been good for business			2
in the months since the earth opened up and snatched these precious cars from our midst , visitors to the museum have increased by 71 % over the same period last year , she said			2
folks have been able to see the hole safely through a glass window			0
also on display , are five cars that were pulled from the hole -- but were too wrecked to be restored : -- a 1984 @entity109 pace car -- a 1993 ruby red " 40th @entity110 " -- a 2001 @entity113 @entity112 -- the 2009 white " 1.5 @entity3 " -- a 1993 @entity114 but visitors said they wanted more			1
so the museum has started selling jars full of dirt from the sinkhole for $ 10 a pop. " they asked for it , " @entity86 said			1
" the dirt has little bits of fiberglass in it from the cars			0
" the road ahead for the remaining two salvageable cars is a bumpy one			0
a 1962 beauty dubbed the " @entity130 " is just too old for @entity10 to handle			2
the company says it no longer has the institutional knowledge required to properly put it back in shape			0
that job is expected to be done by a hand - picked restoration specialist team , @entity86 said			0
" we have n't identified who 's fixing it yet			0
" @entity10 has accepted the challenge of restoring the worst - damaged of the salvageable cars : the 1 @entity3			1
it " has much , much more damage than the @entity12 , " @entity51 said			2
it 's " going to be a much harder , much longer process			0
simply because the car is older so it 's hard to get replacement parts			0
we do n't have all the expertise in house that we do with current corvettes like the @entity12			1
" one of the biggest decisions is how many of the parts on the car should be replaced			0
" one of the guys in design calls it a ' respectful restoration , ' " @entity51 said			0
" you want to keep as much of the original components as you possibly can to preserve the history of the car			0
" restoration on the 1 @entity3 is set to begin in january , @entity51 said , and the job is expected to take about six months			2
@entity11 's total contribution to the museum : $ 250,000			1
an agreement with @entity10 allows the museum to keep the insurance money for the @entity12 and @entity114 -- which are both owned by @entity10 -- in addition to paying to fix the @entity12 , the 1962 @entity130 and the 1992 1 @entity168 , @entity86 said			1
meanwhile , the @entity12 will be back home soon			2
packed with loving care in a special enclosed truck by special handlers , @entity51 said it is expected to head to the museum around saturday			0
when it gets there , workers will roll it back into the holy church of the @entity57 , where for generations to come , visitors will talk about how it survived the @entity180 of 2014 .			0
