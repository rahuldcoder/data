@entity1 police arrested two suspected terrorists with apparent links to an @entity5 - affiliated group tuesday but said they had no indication of an imminent attack			1
the @entity8 identified the suspects as @entity10 , 23 , from @entity11 , who was arrested in the north - central city of @entity13 , and @entity14 , 52 , from @entity15 , who was detained in the southeastern city of @entity17			2
@entity1 police worked with their counterparts in @entity20 and @entity15 to carry out the latest arrests , an @entity8 statement said			1
the two suspects have a " profile " that is similar to the two suspects in the @entity27 attacks , the statement said			0
interior minister @entity28 told reporters that police consider them " lone wolves , " like the @entity32 suspects			1
however , the similarity is based only on how the two suspects in @entity1 were " radicalized , " by going to online forums and chat rooms , and also in the suspects ' alleged interest in pulling from the internet information on bomb - making , said an @entity8 spokesman , who by custom is not identified			1
the pair , who are from different countries , are not brothers and , unlike the two suspects in the @entity27 attacks , have no roots in the @entity48 , he said			0
but @entity49 said one of the suspects recently praised the @entity32 attacks			1
a second @entity8 spokesman said that was the younger suspect , @entity10			0
both of the suspects in @entity1 are unemployed , the second @entity8 spokesman said			1
@entity10 , arrested in @entity13 , studied computer sciences but had not worked professionally in that field , the ministry statement said			0
the two are suspected members of a radical cell close to the terrorist organization @entity63 , the @entity8 said			1
the two men have been under surveillance as part of an operation lasting more than a year run in cooperation with @entity20 and @entity15 , the @entity1 @entity8 said			1
the @entity71 train bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 , led to a sharp increase in @entity1 's fight against @entity76 terrorism			1
the courts convicted 14 @entity76 militants for their role in the bombings , along with four @entity1 convicted for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks			0
since then , authorities have told @entity84 that @entity1 has assigned hundreds of additional police officers to investigate @entity76 terrorism and added dozens of @entity87 translators , so authorities will be able to understand communications and threats			2
around 400 suspected @entity76 militants have been arrested in @entity1 since march 2004 , although many have been released by judges for lack of evidence			0
@entity97 extremist contacts alleged @entity10 was identified and recruited by @entity97 - based members of @entity63 through his interest in radical @entity102 internet sites , the @entity8 statement alleges			1
he was given specific instructions for a trip to a jihadist camp in northern @entity97 led by the group , the @entity8 claims , but was unable to meet with @entity63 leaders because of the heightened security presence in the area			2
since january , @entity20 and nearby @entity111 nations have been supporting @entity97 forces in their efforts to push back @entity102 extremists who carved out a large haven in northern @entity97 last year			1
@entity14 is also alleged to have established contact with @entity63 leaders in @entity97 and to be responsible for recruiting radicals in @entity1			2
one of the people he contacted was directly involved with the kidnapping and murder of two @entity20 citizens in @entity123 in january 2011 , the @entity1 @entity8 said			2
