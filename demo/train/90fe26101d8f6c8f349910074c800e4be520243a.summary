my list of reasons why i 'm glad my girls , ages 5 and 7 , were too young to ever get into " @entity5 " grew exponentially longer after @entity7 ' unforgettable " twerking " in a bra and undies at @entity11 's @entity10			1
" @entity7 , what exactly were you thinking ? " pretty much sums up the sentiment i heard from outraged moms and dads around the country who believe @entity7 , whose loyal fan base includes a huge chunk not yet old enough to drive , should know better			2
" it 's a damn shame that @entity7 is doing this to herself , making a vulgar joke out of her talents and her beauty , but it 's a much bigger shame that she 's doing it to her young fans and other young people ( who ) see her in the media , " said @entity20 , a mom of two teenage boys , in response to a request for comment on @entity26 's facebook page			1
" it 's the same thing as going to any street corner in @entity38 and selling herself for money , " said @entity35			0
" i have to instantly think that @entity7 does not either a ) care what her younger fans think of her or b ) has n't even bothered to think of what her actions ( are ) doing to her image , " said @entity41 , a mom of two whose tween was " absolutely infatuated " with @entity7 but is n't anymore			1
" she thinks @entity7 does not appeal to children ( who ) used to like her as ' @entity5 , ' which speaks volumes coming from a 10 - year - old who had two ' @entity5 ' parties , everything from bed sheets , pajamas , bath soaps , toothbrushes and book bags , " @entity48 added , also in response to a tout on @entity26 's facebook page			2
@entity7 twerks , stuns @entity10 crowd " @entity5 " seems about as relevant to the current day @entity7 as a typewriter is to millenials			1
the 20 - year - old has every right to chart a new course beyond her @entity70 days , moms and dads said in comments on @entity72 and exchanges via e-mail			0
it 's just that the path she is choosing seems so wrong and dangerous , many said			0
@entity78 of @entity79 , @entity80 , said her kids -- ages 9 , 12 and 13 -- will no longer be listening to @entity7 ' music			1
" there is enough fantastic music out there with people who have respectful behavior , especially women who do n't feel the need to be sexual in public in order to be successful , " she added			0
@entity7 ' choice to wear next to nothing and strut around the @entity10 stage is yet another example , frustrated parents say , of the sexualization of our young girls , an issue we touched on at @entity26 just a few weeks ago in our piece on how too many tween fashions are too sexy , skimpy and short			1
" i do think @entity7 wrongly represents the way girls should act today , " said @entity103 , a @entity26 commenter who shared his first name and the fact that he has a 12 - year - old granddaughter			1
" the way they dress , act , not caring about how other people may respond to your actions , " @entity103 added			0
" i think it is an oversexualization of young girls / young women			1
" @entity118 , a mom of three in @entity119 , believes @entity7 ' performance only adds to the already " damaging image of women - as - sex - objects			1
" " i just find it extremely discouraging and difficult to hold out hope for the improved status of women in this world when even the most entitled among us so negatively reinforce the worst stereotypes and misogynistic attitudes about women , " said @entity118			0
opinion : @entity7 is sexual , get over it " her behavior sets 50 to 60 years of women 's forward progress back a long way when you consider that her huge fan base really only consists of young and impressionable girls and horny young boys , who , unfortunately on many levels , are our future leaders , " said @entity132 of @entity133 , in response to a request for comment on @entity26 's facebook page			1
" growing up under the impression that this behavior is not only ok , but acceptable , is such a terrible message and , in this case , i am happy i 'm not a father trying to keep this away from my children , " the 35 - year - old single @entity149 veteran added			0
@entity157 , a father of two , watched the @entity10 with his 15 - year - old son			2
" i am so embarrassed and sitting next to my son and watching this happen made me even more embarrassed , " he added			0
@entity157 said he has conversations with his sons about what 's right and what 's wrong , and said that they know @entity7 ' performance was " not appropriate " and not the behavior of " your normal woman			1
" @entity170 of @entity171 , @entity172 , does n't have kids but works in education and says parents have a role to play			2
" parents need to explain to their kids that what she did is not ok , and should not be imitated , " said @entity177 , adding that parents who did n't like what they were seeing should have changed the channel			2
" i think the biggest responsibility for a parent is to know what their kids are watching , " said @entity185 of suburban @entity186 , who has three teenage sons			0
" the @entity10 are n't appropriate for kids under a certain age and if some parents feel discomfort over what was aired , should they have been letting their kids watch the show in the first place ? " " the @entity10 are supposed to be shocking , " said a woman who did not want to be identified			1
" why is @entity7 such a big deal ? ... i am more shocked people are watching the @entity10 with their children			1
" @entity7 upholds @entity10 tradition after all , consider @entity10 highlights of years past when @entity205 donned a dress made entirely of raw meat and @entity208 and @entity209 kissed ( mouths open ! )			1
it was , in fact , at the @entity10 years earlier when @entity208 broke out onto the national stage with her " @entity215 " performance			2
@entity7 " took a page straight out of @entity208 's playbook , " said @entity216 , a father in @entity217 , on @entity72			0
" i guess i am jaded			0
not very impressed or shocked			0
" while much of the online conversation @entity223 ' national " twerking " episode was dominated by criticism , there was also a very motherly and fatherly response , parents who worry that @entity7 is a child in need of serious help			1
" it 's clear that @entity7 ' lifestyle as a young woman is expressing pain and is dealing with emotional problems , " said @entity229 , an engaged father of two boys in @entity231 , @entity232			2
" her mother and father have a responsibility to come to her aid and work out these social issues before it 's too late , " he added			0
some parents said there was only one upside they could see from the blistering reaction to @entity7 ' performance and that is that it may show strength			1
" the fact that she does n't play the victim and shows that girls can be as aggressive and bad in many ways might in some twisted way pave the way for ( women ) to play in a more level field with men , " said @entity250 , a mom of two from @entity252 who said she was personally disappointed with what @entity7 did at the @entity10			1
" in her performance , she seemed like the one in control and in the driver 's seat , which sets her apart from the ways that perhaps @entity269 or fashion models portray women			0
" @entity271 , a mom of two in @entity274 , @entity275 , sees another positive			0
" there is only one good thing that i can say about her performance on the @entity10 , " said @entity271			2
it shows her 9 - year - old how she " should never act in public			0
" may i repeat how happy i am my girls missed this one completely			0

many parents worry about the impact of @entity7 ' performance on her young fans
@entity7 ' @entity10 show another example of the sexualization of young girls , said some parents
others argued that kids should not have been watching the @entity10 in the first place
one upside to @entity7 ' @entity10 appearance is that it may show strength , said one mom
