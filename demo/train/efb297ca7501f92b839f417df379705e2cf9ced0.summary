@entity0 -- a narrow window of time is closing quickly for @entity4 , the former @entity6 contractor who has infuriated the @entity9 government by leaking details of surveillance programs after fleeing the country			1
as @entity14 agents gather evidence against him , the 29 year old is racing to find a permanent refuge while hiding out in @entity0 on what 's thought to be a 90 - day tourist visa which could expire in early august			1
experts say @entity4 's visa is unlikely to be extended , as he would struggle to prove that his planned stay is temporary			1
" once the 90 days are over , and unless his visa is extended , he 's an illegal immigrant here and could be picked up by the police for overstaying , " said professor @entity23 , director of the @entity24 at the @entity25			2
what becomes of @entity4 depends on a number of factors , not least when and if the @entity9 submits a " surrender request " with the @entity0 government to pave the way for @entity4 's return to the @entity9 scenario 1 : he applies to be a refugee and is spirited out of the city within 90 days @entity4 arrived in the city on may 20 and took refuge in a hotel where he made his revelations to the @entity46 - based @entity45 newspaper before checking out on june 10			1
it 's not clear whether he has approached the local office of the @entity50 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity50 ) -- the office has declined to comment on individual cases -- but @entity23 said it was one way @entity4 could extend his stay			1
" the @entity50 is duty - bound to determine if he 's a mandate refugee			1
if by some miracle they 're able to do that within 90 days and say that he is a refugee , and secondly are able to find a place that will take him , then he could be off to that place , " @entity23 said			2
speaking hypothetically , a protection officer for the @entity50 in @entity0 said that @entity4 would not be given preferential treatment			1
" we prioritize older cases , " @entity63 said , according to the @entity64			0
claims through the @entity50 have been known to take years			2
scenario 2 : he finds a country willing to take him @entity4 has already sounded out @entity71 for a potential asylum claim , according to @entity74 spokesman , @entity71 journalist @entity73			2
@entity73 told @entity1 he was asked by an intermediary , who he was " 100 % certain " was acting on behalf of @entity4 , to approach the @entity71 government			2
@entity73 said he contacted two offices -- the interior ministry and the prime minister 's office -- and the response was less than welcoming			0
poll : most @entity9 give @entity4 thumbs down " they pointed to the legal code and the understanding , for example , that the asylum seeker must be in the jurisdiction before he can apply for asylum , " @entity73 said			1
however , he added that he did not consider what he called the ministers ' " informal " replies as a final answer			0
" this is a matter not just for the government in @entity71 but also the @entity71 parliament and an important issue to be debated among the general public			0
" when asked in a live chat monday on the @entity45 website why he did n't fly direct to @entity71 , @entity4 said he feared he 'd be intercepted en route so he chose " a country with the legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained			2
" he added that " @entity71 could be pushed harder , quicker , before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known , and i would not put that past the current @entity9 administration			2
" a number of other countries have been floated as a possible refugee for the @entity6 leaker who has acknowledged that he can never go home			1
early speculation centered on potential deal with @entity117 , however an opinion piece published thursday in @entity114 newspaper , the @entity113 , suggests that @entity118 may be best advised to stay out of it			0
" @entity117 should make good use of the ' one country , two systems ' practice with regards to @entity0 , and let the @entity0 authorities deal with @entity4 in accordance with their own laws , " the author wrote			1
another opinion piece in @entity114 paper @entity131 suggested that @entity118 should side with public opinion			0
" the consequences of extraditing @entity4 back to the @entity9 would be more troublesome than the alternative , because the local reaction would bring more trouble to @entity0 and the @entity117 mainland			1
@entity117 's growing power is attracting people to seek asylum in @entity117			0
this is unavoidable and should be used to accumulate moral standing			0
" scenario 3 : his visa expires and he 's arrested by @entity0 police if @entity4 is still in @entity0 when his visa expires , he 'd most likely make an asylum claim , if he has n't already gone to the @entity50			1
" if he was to make an asylum claim at that point in time then they would n't go ahead with the overstaying prosecution -- it would be suspended -- and then the asylum process kicks in , " @entity23 said			0
if @entity4 sought asylum in @entity0 , it 's likely he 'd file a torture claim , based on @entity156 and 3 of the 1984 @entity50 " @entity157 , " @entity23 said			1
however , @entity158 , an immigration lawyer at @entity159 , said torture claims were hard to prove			0
" the threshold for ' cruel , inhuman and degrading ' is pretty high particularly when the country in question is the @entity9 it has succeeded in relation to @entity166 prison conditions			2
it is arguable in the light of @entity170 but you would need to find a country which is willing to take on the @entity9 and say that its treatment of prisoners breaches @entity175 of the @entity176 , " she said			2
@entity170 , the @entity9 soldier accused of providing classified information to website @entity74 , has claimed he has been mistreated in custody			2
in 2011 , @entity170 's lawyer filed a formal complaint alleging his client had been stripped , denied his glasses and confined to a cell for 23 hours a day with no pillow , sheets or personal items			0
@entity170 is appearing before a court - martial this week after pleading guilty to 10 of 22 charges against him and faces up to 20 years in jail			0
scenario 4 : he makes a run for it ... being spirited away on a plane or a boat might be attractive options for @entity4 to escape @entity0 authorities , if his visa is about to expire and the @entity9 has yet to make its move			1
@entity23 said until the @entity9 files an arrest warrant -- or even a provisional one -- there 's no onus on carriers to report @entity4 's presence if he turns up at a departure gate			1
" it may well be that informally that there are channels ' that these are individuals , if you do come across them let us know please ' but nothing that obligates them to do this , " he added			0
@entity1 asked a number of airlines whether they 've been asked by authorities report @entity4			2
@entity219 said in a statement : " for privacy and security reasons , it would be inappropriate for us to discuss communications , if any , received from governmental agencies			0
it would be up to the sending agency to share the information it deems appropriate			0
" @entity230 and @entity231 gave a similar response			0
if @entity4 was able to make it onto a vessel , @entity9 authorities would be limited in their ability arrest him , even if they were on board , said dr @entity239 , associate professor at the @entity25			1
" that would be a violation of the sovereignty of the airline , " @entity239 said , adding that the country where the airline is registered has jurisdiction over the flight			0
the same applies for ships , except in the case of piracy			0
however , he said if the alleged crime was serious enough -- for example , crimes against humanity , torture , slavery and hijacking -- universal jurisdiction kicks in			0
" crimes subject to universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all ( the entire world community ) , " he said , adding " in this sense , i do not think universal jurisdiction shall apply in ( @entity4 's ) case			0
" scenario 5 : @entity9 issues an arrest warrant and he 's detained this could be the worst case scenario for @entity4			1
if the @entity9 issues a surrender warrant , @entity4 could be detained by authorities in @entity0 , after first being given the go - ahead by the territory 's chief executive to arrest him			1
once detained , @entity23 said @entity4 would likely appear in an open court where a magistrate would decide whether there is enough evidence to commit him to trial			0
based on that decision , @entity0 's chief executive would then decide whether to approve the surrender order and send @entity4 back to the @entity9 under @entity0 law , the surrender order could be blocked if it appears that the offense is of a political nature or if the alleged offender might be punished on the basis of his or her political opinions			1
however , other considerations would be the 1996 treaty between the @entity50 and @entity0 which takes precedence over the relevant law and includes a clause on " offenses involving the unlawful use of computers , " @entity23 said .			1

time is running out for @entity4 before his 90 - day @entity0 tourist visa expires
experts say he may have already approached the @entity50 for refugee status
@entity9 authorities are yet to issue an arrest warrant for the 29 - year - old leaker
