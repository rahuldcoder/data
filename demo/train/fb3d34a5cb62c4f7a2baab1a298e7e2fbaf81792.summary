-- people hurled stones and eggs at the @entity6 prime minister 's convoy this week , a spurt of violence just days before the one - time @entity10 province holds its first elections since declaring independence			1
the flare - up wednesday targeted prime minister @entity14 in the western town of @entity16			0
it unsettled the @entity19 country and international officials looking forward to peaceful local elections on sunday in a land scarred by conflict and now slowly on the mend			0
there will be races in 36 municipalities for mayors and assembly members , with more than 1.5 million people eligible to vote			1
december 13 has been set as the day for any second round of mayoral elections that may be needed			0
" intervening in the election process is a serious violation and criminal acts which are politically incited will be prosecuted by relevant legal bodies , " said the @entity6 government in a statement posted on @entity14 's web site			2
while saying the campaign season has been " largely free of violence , " the @entity41 @entity40 in @entity42 , @entity6 's capital , noted the disturbance " with distress " and called on " political leaders , parties and activists to refrain from all violence and provocations			2
" @entity6 has long been a restive province of @entity10 with a majority ethnic @entity53 population			1
the @entity6 government estimates the country 's population at more than two million , with an estimated 92 percent @entity53 , 5.3 percent @entity58 , and 2.7 percent other groups			1
@entity10 - @entity53 sectarian tension boiled over as the former @entity61 broke up in the 1990s			1
after the brutal civil war in @entity6 in the late 1990s , which pitched @entity53 insurgents against @entity58 security forces and @entity68 - backed @entity58 paramilitaries , the country began operating under a @entity70 mission and a @entity72 - led peacekeeping force			1
as the aggressor , @entity10 under @entity73 had endured months of intense @entity72 bombing			1
@entity73 later died after a heart attack as he awaited trial at the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) in the @entity79			0
the ethnic - @entity53 majority eventually declared the province independent in february 2008 , but @entity10 and many ethnic @entity58 staunchly opposed the move			1
they regard @entity6 as @entity10 territory and refuse to recognize its sovereignty			1
next month , at the @entity86 , @entity10 is expected to challenge @entity6 's independence -- recognized by the @entity41 and other countries and entities			1
there also has been talk of an election boycott by the minority @entity10 population , with the logic being that participation would be a tacit recognition of @entity6 's independence			1
but @entity6 and its backers in the international community want the native @entity58 to embrace the new country			1
president @entity102 hailed a call from 100 @entity58 intellectuals urging @entity58 to take part in the elections and countered those @entity10 voices he says are discouraging @entity58 from going to the polls			1
" i invite all the members of @entity58 community who are citizens and residents of @entity6 to get involved in all fields of social and public lives			1
this would be to the benefit of us all , to the benefit of each family and to the benefit of all citizens , " he said thursday			0
international officials are heartened by the participation of many @entity124 entities -- such as political parties and independent candidates			0
the election commission says of the 74 certified political entities in the races , 34 are @entity53 , 22 @entity10 , and the rest various other ethnicities -- @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , and @entity137			2
@entity41 ambassador to @entity6 @entity139 says there 's a " growing recognition " of the elections ' benefits			2
he cites the goal of decentralization , an effort to give @entity147 , @entity58 and others the power " to assume responsibility for organizing themselves , for running their own local governments			2
" " i believe the november elections are a critical opportunity for the @entity58 community to assume much greater control of the day - to - day running of their own lives in ways that really matter , " @entity154 said in a speech last month			2
and there is optimism as well about the significance of the election process			0
it 's the first time @entity6 is organizing any elections itself , @entity154 said , with @entity6 and its @entity170 -- not the @entity70 or the @entity171 -- " running the show			2
" @entity174 , acting spokeswoman for the @entity6 mission of the @entity171 , told @entity0 that the " general impression is that the campaign has been relatively calm			2
" the @entity171 -- which had been organizing all elections in @entity6 since 2000 and now provides technical support and advice to @entity6 's @entity170 , " would certainly like to see an orderly process without incident on sunday , " @entity174 said			0
@entity182 -- who holds the @entity184 chair and is director of the @entity186 at the @entity187 in @entity188 -- said the " local elections are politically and internationally significant in the evolution of the new state			0
" in remarks published by @entity187 on thursday , @entity182 said @entity6 has growing pains , the kind " newly emergent states " have in their early stages			0
he cites " inadequate administrative capabilities , limited oversight of governmental bodies , and inability to deliver essential services to the citizens			0
" " @entity6 also has additional problems in that @entity42 does not control the entire territory , has a rudimentary security structure , and remains largely dependent on international institutions , " he said			0
but , @entity182 said , the elections " will indicate @entity6 's commitment to democratic principles " and help opponents of @entity6 's independence realize " that a stable emerging democracy at the heart of the @entity19 contributes to regional stability			0
" and , keeping radicalism at bay during " difficult economic times " will be the country 's " major challenge in the year ahead			0
" " a free and fair election in a competitive political climate is the most effective way to demonstrate that @entity6 seeks to be a full member of the international community , " he said .			0
