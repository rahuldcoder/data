a remote island with stunning underground architecture			1
a massive crypt lined with copper bars , a colossal sphere at its center			0
mazes made of stone that lead from one underground chamber to another , each differing in shape and size			2
i did n't expect my visit to the @entity16 " art island " of @entity17 to remind me of the world of @entity19 , the computer game i played as a child			1
it 's been more than a decade since i played the game , but that strange , beautifully desolate island and the eerie feeling of wandering around it alone have stayed with me			2
exploring @entity17 's underground galleries , i was reminded again and again of @entity19 's mysterious mechanical structures , right down to the discovery of " puzzles " that visitors are meant to figure out on their own			1
magnificent architecture some 3,000 islands dot the @entity34 , which separates @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , three of the four main islands of @entity16			1
while many of those islands remain quiet and uninhabited , @entity17 has been turned into one of the most remarkable art and architecture destinations in the world			1
visitors often refer to it as " @entity47 , " since most of the structures on the island were designed by @entity51 - winning architect @entity50			1
a museum designed by and dedicated to the renowned architect is also located on the island			2
@entity17 's transformation into a unique art project began in 1987 , when @entity57 , the chairman of @entity58 , now known as the @entity59 , purchased the south side of the island			1
enlisted by @entity57 to supervise development on the southern portion of the island , @entity50 went to work over the next two decades designing a hotel complex and museums			1
adhering to his guiding principle of designing buildings that follow the natural forms of landscapes , @entity50 's buildings on the island blend into or are built into the earth , some of them opening up to the sky			1
' perfect balance of light , sound , space , color ' some of @entity50 's buildings became part of the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , which showcases major artworks acquired by the company over the past decades			1
since 1995 , many of those pieces have been created specifically for the island			2
that same year , the company established the @entity92 at the @entity93 , commissioning winners to create works specifically for @entity85 , which includes @entity17 and the nearby islands of @entity97 and @entity98			1
just as the art has been designed for the island , the buildings that house the works have been designed to maximize the impact of the art. opened in 2004 , the island 's @entity105 showcases its collection in spectacular and unexpected ways			1
in the museum 's @entity110 , a vast , pure white underground chamber is made up of hundreds of thousands of tiny stone tiles			0
the dazzling while tiles perfectly show off the enormous blue and violet paintings on each wall			0
visitors remove their shoes at the entrance and are given soft slippers			0
when i visited , i was the only person in the room ( not counting an attendant who stood in a corner as still as a sculpture )			0
the space gleams white from the natural light peering through a white stone ceiling			0
it was the same everywhere i went on the island -- quiet , stupefying displays of beauty and art with breathtaking sea or landscapes in the background			2
visitor numbers are restricted throughout the exhibitions			0
" they 've managed to create a perfect balance of light , sound , space , color and proportion , which makes the experience transcendent and unforgettable , " says @entity138 , a @entity139 - based fine arts photographer at work on a project inspired by @entity17			2
the same as i did , @entity150 found the @entity110 a shock			0
" growing up in @entity152 , i was very familiar with @entity154 's work and accustomed to seeing it everywhere to the point that i was n't particularly interested when i heard he was displayed in the @entity105 , " says @entity150			0
" the unbelievable , almost holistic presentation of @entity154 's @entity160 paintings made me see them in a light i had never before experienced			0
" where to stay , what to see limited accommodation on the island mean the number of visitors is limited			0
while small inns have been cropping up on the island , a stay at the hotel @entity171 remains by far the best way to get the full @entity17 experience			2
comprised of four different lodgings ( museum , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 ) , the hotel 's rooms all provide incredible views of the @entity34 and have beautiful art of their own			2
it 's a bit like staying at a modern art gallery			0
the standout is the breathtaking @entity180 ( see gallery above ) , with its six rooms built around an oval pond			0
@entity180 is connected to the @entity192 by a monorail accessible only to @entity180 guests			0
@entity59 operates a free shuttle bus from @entity192 to nearby @entity196 and @entity105			0
the shuttle also runs to the more removed @entity198 , once a castle town , on the island 's east side , where the @entity202 and the @entity203 are located			0
the former is a small museum designed by @entity50 featuring his architecture ; the latter is a project that turns empty houses into works of art. visitors to the @entity198 side can pick up a map from the @entity215 , a visitor 's center and gift shop , and take part in a treasure hunt around the old castle town to find the art projects hidden in century - old houses			1
the nearby islands of @entity98 and @entity97 house continuations of the remarkable @entity84 project			1
@entity17 is reached by ferry from the ports of @entity229 ( near @entity230 ) and @entity231			2
