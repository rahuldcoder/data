@entity0 , @entity1 -- with their unique shape and imposing stature , the majestic baobab trees have been an icon of @entity1 's landscape for centuries , unmovable symbols of the tropical island 's luscious scenery			1
six out of the eight species of the long - lived tree are endemic to @entity1 , the island country located in the @entity15 off the southeastern coast of @entity17			1
the stunning country is home to a rich ecosystem that boasts an incredible mosaic of animal and plant life evolved for tens of millions of years in complete isolation			1
as a result 90 % of @entity1 's wildlife exists nowhere else on the planet			1
in the midst of it all , the mighty baobab has stood tall for generations , its barrel - like trunk reaching a height of 18 meters			0
often described as " the upside down tree " due to its unusual shape -- the tree 's branches look like roots sticking up in the air -- the baobab has sparked many legends throughout the centuries			2
an ancient myth goes that when the gods planted the trees , they kept walking away so they placed them upside down			0

" there are many interactions with the life of community living around forest , " explains botanist @entity61			0
" first , they use the bark for the construction of their house and then they use leaves as medicinal plants			0
they eat also the fruit because the fruit are very rich in vitamins and do n't forget also it 's one of the attraction for tourists to come here			0
" but while tourism proceeds can generate income for people often living on less than $ 2 a day , many other human activities are posing a serious threat to the baobab trees and the island 's one - of - a - kind ecosystem			0
largely dependent on the island 's natural resources , many rural communities in @entity1 have to make ends meet by exploiting the land that surrounds them -- the country is estimated to have lost 90 % of its forest to deforestation over the years			1
environmentalists say that activities like slash - and - burn agriculture -- where an area of forest is cut and burned to create fields -- logging for timber and fuelwood and charcoal production are all destroying the island 's beautiful rainforests and their endemic biodiversity			2
" they cut the trees down to clear the land for agriculture or for grazing their animals , " says @entity61 , who has moved to the island 's northernmost part near the city of @entity115 to teach locals about biodiversity			0
in recent years , authorities in @entity1 have taken up a series of initiatives to save its precious forests			2
the country has launched several conservation and reforestation projects and has also marked many regions in the country as national parks , attracting ecotourists from across the world			1
@entity61 says that more needs to be done to safeguard the future of the baobab trees and the vast array of unique species living in @entity1 's forests			1
" now the government they want to increase the surface of protected areas			0
they made a big effort but right now i see for baobab it 's not yet representative , " he says			0
" a good example is this forest in front of us -- it is not protected but this has the highest concentration of population of this endemic species			2
" unless more action is taken and behaviors change , @entity1 , one of the world 's true biodiversity hotspots , will risk losing more of its forests , putting in danger the survival of its unique species .			1
