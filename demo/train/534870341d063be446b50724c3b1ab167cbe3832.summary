-- a @entity2 satellite that ran out of fuel will start falling in the next few days , and fragments of the disintegrating 2,000 - pound spacecraft are expected to strike the @entity7 's surface			1
nobody knows where or when the fragments will hit , but the @entity11 has said the parts are likely to fall into the ocean or unpopulated areas			1
potential spots will be narrowed down closer to re-entry , @entity11 said on its website			0
re-entry probably will occur sunday or monday , @entity19 , mission manager for the @entity20 and @entity21 , better known as @entity22 , told the @entity23			0
@entity22 was launched in 2009 to map variations in the @entity7 's gravity in @entity26 , provide ocean circulation patterns and make other measurements			1
@entity11 's website said the satellite " became the first seismometer in orbit " in march 2011 when it detected sound waves from the earthquake that struck @entity35			2
@entity22 was expected to fall much earlier but fuel consumption was less than expected			0
in august , the satellite 's altitude was lowered to about 139 miles , lowest of any research satellites , to improve the accuracy of the information being gathered , @entity11 's website said			2
@entity22 ran out of fuel october 21			0
on november 4 , @entity11 's website said the satellite was orbiting the @entity7 at 119 miles and the rate of descent would increase significantly in coming days .			1

nobody knows where or when fragments will strike @entity7
pieces most likely to hit oceans and unpopulated areas
