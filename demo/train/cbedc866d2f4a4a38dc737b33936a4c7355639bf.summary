@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 set his green plan into action monday , potentially reversing several @entity7 - era decisions on global warming and fuel efficiency			1
@entity3 president @entity2 signs orders monday on vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency standards			1
in his first major environmental acts as president , @entity2 directed his @entity15 to review a @entity17 application to regulate greenhouse gases and told his @entity19 to begin implementing fuel efficiency standards passed last year but not implemented by the @entity7 administration			1
he also pushed for passage of the $ 825 billion economic stimulus package in the @entity23 and @entity24			0
those bills include money for investments in renewable energy , conservation and a better electric grid			0
" no single issue is as fundamental to our future as energy , " @entity2 said at a @entity23 news conference			2
" it is time for this moment of peril to be turned into one of progress			0
" @entity17 emissions : under the @entity42 , @entity17 has long sought to tighten its air quality standards			1
to achieve those standards , @entity17 would likely require cars to emit fewer greenhouse gases			1
currently the federal government does not regulate carbon dioxide emissions - the main culprit in greenhouse gases			1
the @entity7 administration recently denied @entity17 's request saying that new federal fuel standards made stricter rules there unnecessary			1
@entity2 said his administration will review that decision			1
any change in policy would likely take months to implement			2
" let me be clear : our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry ; it is to help @entity3 's automakers prepare for the future , " said the president			1
the environmental community applauded the move			0
new emission standards could result in vehicles that get better gas mileage			2
" with these actions our new president is not just stepping up to the threat of climate chaos , " @entity71 , head of the climate center at the @entity73 , wrote on his blog			2
" the cleaner cars he will help put on the road will show us the way to reduce our dangerous dependence on oil and will push automakers to make the cars that the world will want and need in the 21st century			2
" the auto industry , which has opposed @entity17 's effort to raise its air quality standards , said in the past it will result in an expensive patchwork of emissions standards and force them to build different cars for different markets			1
seventeen other states may adopt @entity17 's rules if the @entity2 administration allows it , representing over half the vehicle market			1
on monday @entity99 said it is trying to make more efficient vehicles , but said any standard must be " workable			0
" " @entity99 is working aggressively on the products and the advance technologies that match the nation 's and consumer 's priorities to save energy and reduce emissions , " the company said in a statement to @entity104			0
" we 're ready to engage the @entity2 administration and the @entity113 on policies that support meaningful and workable solutions and targets that benefit consumers from coast to coast			2
" @entity119 had no comment , and @entity121 could not be reached			0
it 's possible automakers would simply make their entire fleet conform to the stricter standard - thus upping fuel efficiency standards for the whole nation			1
it 's also possible the auto industry would make different cars for different markets , perhaps not selling certain bigger cars in states that adopted the new standard			0
either way , most analysts said it would raise prices for everyone			0
" anytime you have to comply with two different sets of standards , it 's more expensive , " said @entity139 of @entity140 , an automotive research company			2
@entity139 also said having two different standards could be a challenge for the auto industry at this time - they are currently losing money and have recently received billion in taxpayer support			2
federal fuel efficiency rules could be more easily relaxed if the industry had a hard time complying , he said			1
" it 's in our nation 's best interest to be under a common strategy , " he said			0
fuel efficiency standards : regardless of what @entity17 does , @entity2 also moved to implement higher fuel efficiency standards passed in 2007			1
those increases - the first in more than 30 years - called for raising the average fuel economy from 27.5 miles a gallon for cars and 22 miles a gallon for trucks to 35 miles a gallon for the whole fleet by 2020			0
@entity2 said the increased standards would save 2 million barrels of oil a day			1
that 's about 10 % of the country 's total oil consumption , and roughly the same amount the country currently imports from the @entity178			0
" this rule will be a downpayment on a broader and sustained effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil , " said the president			0
the new standards , originally supported by @entity7 , were put on hold during his last days in office , in response to the woes facing the auto industry			1
the industry has long opposed raising fuel economy standards			2
it has argued that the new rules are expensive and unnecessary since it already makes fuel efficient cars			2
stimulus : @entity2 also called on @entity113 to pass the $ 825 billion stimulus plan currently under debate in both houses			1
tens of billions of dollars are allocated for energy programs under both plans			0
the @entity23 version contains $ 20 billion in tax incentives for the industry that are intended to get money flowing back into a sector particularly hard hit by the financial crisis and help @entity2 meet his stated goal of doubling renewable energy production in the @entity3 in three years			1
it also contains $ 10 billion to modernize the countries aging electric grid , including money for a so - called smart grid			0
the smart grid basically involves digitizing and connecting the country 's aging utility grid			0
experts say it will result in greater efficiency because appliances will be able to turn on and off when electricity is cheapest , consumers will have more information about how much electricity they are using , and when and where they are using it			0
the smart grid is also essential if various forms of renewable energy like wind and solar are to be used			0
the @entity23 version of stimulus also calls for billion in conservation money for federal buildings , public housing , and homeowner incentives			0
" @entity3 will not be held hostage to dwindling resources , hostile regimes and a warming planet , " said @entity2			1
" this is the boost that our economy needs and the new beginning that our future demands			0
