-- they lined up for a group portrait			2
a few chairs up front			2
everybody else up on his feet			2
" rookies in the back , " says @entity19 , president of the @entity20 , who was there on a recent sunday to help set up the shot , explaining its general protocol for me			1
" old guard helps to organize the troops			2
seats reserved for those who need them			2
plus those " rookies , " the ones inducted by the @entity20 july 27 in picture - perfect @entity40 , @entity41 -- the ex-ballplayers @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , along with the ex-managers @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , all about to pose for this particular " team photo " for the first time			1
that selfie @entity52 took at the @entity53 had nothing on this			2
this was a game of thrones for the baseball gods			2
this was a @entity62 bubblegum - card collection come to life			1
living legends of the game , mortals who made it to the shrine of the immortals , all but a precious few ( like @entity79 ) having felt well enough to attend this yearly ceremony in person -- holy cow , practically everybody who was anybody was there			1
yep , yet again , no @entity86			1
@entity87 , the man with 4,256 hits ( first on the all - time list )			1
the man with 15,890 plate appearances ( also first ) and 14,053 official at - bats ( also first )			1
the man who got on base 5,929 times ( also first )			2
the man who played in the @entity97 six times and made 17 all - star teams			1
the man who is n't in the picture			0
is n't in the @entity20			1
is n't welcome in this exclusive club			0
oh , he was there in the town of @entity40 , all right			0
very visibly , in fact			0
maybe you saw him if you were among the tens of thousands who made a pilgrimage to the village overlooking @entity112 to see the stars come out			1
maybe you saw 73 - year - old @entity86 autographing bats and balls for a fee as he sat in front of a rack of red t - shirts emblazoned with : " @entity120			1
" except you ca n't vote for @entity121			0
i understand this all too well because i ca n't vote for @entity121 , either , and i 'm a genuine voter			0
i actually have a small say in this			0
i get a @entity20 ballot in the mail			1
i can vote for as many as 10 names on each year 's list or as few as none -- my call			0
i do not vote for @entity86 , alas , because i can not			1
his name is not on the ballot			0
and write - in votes are neither permitted nor counted , a waste of ink			1
i can vote ( or not ) for @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , certain guys who once seemed to be sure things , but , like front - runners in political campaigns , fell out of favor by the time voters got their ballots			1
i can vote ( or not ) for @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and others who have been on the ballot for multiple years without success , guys who still have time to be reassessed and accepted into the game 's highest society			0
@entity86 , though , is a no - go			1
he is persona non grata , an ineligible receiver of votes , banned for life			0
he is not a sympathetic figure			0
he erred in a way few in baseball have erred			0
he made bets on games while still in uniform , which was ( and still is ) strictly prohibited			2
@entity87 did not bet against his own team , as some of the similarly disgraced 1919 @entity172 did , but his gambling habits broke a code of conduct , violated a set - in - stone rule and earned him a " lifetime " ban that @entity87 was tagged with after a @entity179 internal investigation in 1989			1
complicating matters , @entity87 spent close to 15 years denying all allegations until fessing up in a book he wrote in 2004			1
furthermore , he was slapped with a five - month prison sentence and a thousand hours of community service for two felony counts of evading income tax			2
in 1991 , the board of baseball 's @entity20 placed the name of @entity86 on the " permanently ineligible " list			1
his is the only name on it			0
by this point , you have made up your own mind , as so many of us have			2
you are from one of two camps			0
one is the " has n't @entity121 suffered enough ? " one			0
the other is the " @entity121 got exactly what he deserved " one			0
in my opinion -- with utmost respect for all who feel otherwise -- a life sentence is unduly harsh			0
we live on an @entity210 in which past sins can be forgiven , in which those who commit crimes do their time , pay their debts , then pray for a drop of milk of human kindness			0
a case could be made that @entity86 need n't be crucified for what he did , that it would n't kill the game of baseball to finally let him off the hook			1
they say gambling is a sickness , an addiction , like liquor or drugs			2
they tell us gamblers need help			0
in the same breath , they tell us funny stories about the @entity20 baseball greats who bar - hopped all night , came to the park drunk , played with a hangover , hahaha , what a guy			1
it is , of course , a @entity20 also occupied by an accused gambler or two , by a wife - beater or two , a philanderer or two , a racist or two , a cheater or two , a rule - breaker or two			1
just as today 's voters continue to debate who did and did n't demonstrate exemplary character , we could argue whether @entity86 must be forever bound by " rules are rules , " or if rules , as some have been known to say , are made to be changed			1
i pictured baseball 's giants posing for that picture			0
a hero here , a hero there			0
a man missing here , a man missing there , @entity20 hallowed figures @entity273 and @entity275 having lost their lives this year			1
everybody who showed up to smile for the camera deserved to do exactly that			0
each belonged to the club			0

@entity86 broke all kinds of records , made 17 all - star teams
@entity294 says his lifetime ban for gambling was *punishment* enough
he says @entity87 deserves to be in the @entity20 considering his *achievements*
