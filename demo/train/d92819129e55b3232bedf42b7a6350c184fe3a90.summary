-- in a @entity4 elementary school , 26 people , including 20 children , were killed by a gunman friday morning			1
this comes on the heels of a shooting rampage on tuesday in @entity9 , where a masked man opened fire into crowds at a mall , killing two before killing himself			0
tragic images flash across our television screens and computer monitors , as they have so many times in recent memory			0
these events will once again set in motion a predictable cycle of ineffectual chatter about gun violence in @entity26			2
we will be told that now is not the time to discuss policy			2
by tomorrow , a well - funded gun rights propaganda machine will move into action			1
for the adherents of this ideology , the solution to the problem of gun violence is not better regulations but more guns			1
school shootings ? arm the teachers			2
movie theater shootings ? arm the moviegoers			0
analysis : why gun controls are off the agenda in @entity26 contemporary gun rights ideology makes a mockery of the @entity49 ideals of the @entity50 of the @entity51			1
the founders obviously supported gun ownership , but they favored strong gun regulation			2
@entity26 has the former , but nobody seems willing to talk rationally about the latter			0
we all need to take a cue from the @entity50			0
some have interpreted the @entity51 's affirmation of the right to bear arms as a barrier to reasonable regulation			1
nothing could be further from the truth			0
the @entity51 does not pose a barrier to gun regulation , it requires it			1
as long as there have been guns in @entity26 they have been regulated			2
it would have been impossible to muster the militia to fight the @entity75 if we applied today 's gun rights ideology to the @entity78			1
registration , mandatory inspection of firearms and frequent training were all essential to a well - regulated militia			0
in @entity26 today , we have many more guns , but far less government regulation of firearms			2
our ideas of armed self - defense are at odds with the @entity91 ' vision			0
at the time the @entity51 was written , the common law view of the right of self - defense inherited from @entity95 was very limited			1
indeed , returning to the original understanding of the right of self - defense would require repealing " stand your ground " laws that some states have adopted			0
under @entity95 common law one had a legal duty to retreat , not stand your ground			0
as early as 1328 , @entity105 acted to limit armed travel , with the notable exception that members of the nobility were allowed to travel with armed retainers , a legal recognition of the privileges of aristocratic birth			0
the @entity78 did not usher in a new era of expansive gun rights			1
@entity116 , one of the most pro-gun voices among the @entity119 generation , proposed but failed to secure a robust individual right to have arms included in the @entity122 in 1776			0
10 ways to put brakes on mass shootings in schools individual states did recognize a right to travel armed with a musket to meet the legal obligation to attend militia musters , but states and localities regulated the exercise of this right and in some cases prohibited traveling with a loaded weapon or discharging a weapon at or near a muster			0
in 1835 , @entity140 passed a law that severely limited the right to travel armed : " no person may go armed with a dirk , dagger , sword , pistol , or other offensive and dangerous weapon , without reasonable cause to apprehend an assault or violence to his person , family , or property			1
" the key legal concept here is reasonable cause for fear , precisely the standard that gun rights advocates wish to overturn and a federal court in @entity161 recently upheld			1
supporters of gun regulation won an important victory when the @entity165 upheld @entity167 's requirement that one show " proper cause " to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun in public			2
the court rejected the idea that one had a right to carry arms in the absence of a reasonable fear of imminent violence			0
the lead plaintiff in the case , @entity182 , said that the court 's emphasis on reason is a " ridiculous interpretation of the @entity51			1
" sadly , the idea of reason has become ridiculous to some			0
polls : your thoughts on gun control but champions of gun control were handed a defeat when on tuesday , in @entity198 , the @entity197 ruled that the state 's ban on carrying a weapon in public is unconstitutional			1
in contrast to @entity161 , and against the advice of experts , @entity198 did not rewrite the law to include an exception for arming oneself when there was a reasonable fear of imminent danger			1
the @entity213 ' ruling in the @entity161 case has put us in the right direction ; @entity198 ought to follow @entity161 's example			1
it is time to inject more sense and reason back into @entity26 's debate over guns			1
not talking about changing our default gun policy will guarantee more tragedies			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

in a @entity4 school , at least 26 were killed , including at least 20 children
@entity227 : gun rights ideology makes a mockery of *values* of @entity51
he says @entity161 recently upheld a reasonable gun law , but @entity198 did not
@entity239 : it is time to inject more sense and reason back into the debate over guns
