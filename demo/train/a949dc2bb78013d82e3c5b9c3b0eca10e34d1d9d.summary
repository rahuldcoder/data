way back in the mists of time , when schoolkids were expected to learn seemingly endless lists of facts off by heart , they chanted a poem to remember the names of @entity10 's kings and queens			1
" @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , " it began			0
" @entity15 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity15 three / one , two , three neds , @entity21 two / @entity20 four , five , six , then who ? " it then ended with the most recent monarchs : " @entity25 seven , @entity26 and @entity28 / @entity27 the sixth , now @entity29 instead			1
" of course , it 's not done that way any more , but if it were , which name would make it into the next verse ? we know that " @entity27 " and " @entity36 " will follow " @entity29 , " but which name will follow theirs ? long before it was announced that @entity36 and @entity40 had had a baby boy , speculation about what they 'll call the newest addition to the royal family reached fever pitch			1
would they pick a name that has already featured in that schoolroom poem ? read more : what will the royal baby look like ? " @entity36 and @entity54 are very much a couple of the 21st century but i think they will stick to traditional names , in keeping with the past , " @entity54 's biographer @entity53 told @entity55			1
whatever the pair pick as the all - important first name , there will be plenty of room to fit in nods to other members of the family too			0
" @entity68 have quite a lot of names , " said @entity67			2
" @entity27 is actually @entity27 , and the @entity71 is @entity71			1
her father , @entity72 , had five names			0
" writing for @entity55 , royal author @entity74 agreed : " although we ca n't know what the child 's name will be , we can be sure that he or she will have a lot of them : some heirs to the throne [ have ] had as many as seven or eight			0
" but now we know it 's a boy , @entity67 said the couple 's choice was simpler in theory , since there are fewer traditionally " royal " male names to choose from			1
@entity27 and @entity93 are the current frontrunners with bookmakers , with odds of between 6/4 and 11/4			1
" we 're very fond of @entity98 in this country , " she said			0

prince @entity27 is expected to be known as @entity106 when he ascends to the throne ; @entity72 was actually christened @entity108 ; and his brother , @entity109 , who became @entity110 after his 1936 abdication , was known as @entity112 by family and friends			1
history has also knocked several male names out of the equation : @entity25 is unlikely , given that scandalous abdication so he could marry @entity120 divorcee @entity119 , and the various @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 are viewed as cruel , tyrannical or just downright unpopular			0
" @entity27 , at 10/1 , and @entity19 , at 8/1 , are very unlikely , " @entity74 wrote			2
" @entity27 is already taken as the name of prince @entity36 's father , and @entity19 was one of the worst kings in @entity103 history			1
" @entity19 was forced to sign the @entity128 by his nobles in 1215 ; he was portrayed as the key villain in " @entity131			0
" " there 's no way they would pick @entity25 as a first name , " insists @entity67			0
" and you ca n't have @entity137 , after @entity140 ( though of course if @entity15 came to the throne he would be @entity137 )			0
my bet is on @entity25			0
" in recent years , there has been a move away from classic " regal " names by those on lower branches of the royal family tree			2
prince @entity74 and his now ex-wife @entity149 plumped for the unusual @entity150 and @entity151 for prince @entity36 's cousins			1
princess @entity153 , @entity36 's aunt , has two granddaughters by son @entity155 and @entity157 daughter - in - law @entity156 : @entity158 ( born in 2010 ) and @entity159 ( born in 2012 )			2
read more : who can inherit @entity103 throne ? but @entity162 said @entity36 and @entity54 were always unlikely to go for more " trendy " options on the lists of popular names			1
in 2013 , the most popular names for baby boys in the @entity103 so far are @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 , according to babynames.co.uk			2
" obviously other members of the royal family have broken with tradition but the offspring of @entity36 and @entity54 will be a future monarch , " she said			2
that means , says @entity67 , " we 're not going to see a @entity179 , or a @entity180 , or an @entity181			0
" nevertheless , @entity103 betting shops are more than happy to take your money if you fancy a flutter on a more modern or quirky moniker			0
if you think the future monarch might name a king - in - waiting after the @entity106 , you can always give it a shot : ladbrokes are offering odds of 500/1 in favor of @entity194 , while the chances of the baby prince being named after @entity198 rapper and @entity200 sensation @entity199 are a long shot 5000/1			2
