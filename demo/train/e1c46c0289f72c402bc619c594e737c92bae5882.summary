@entity0 -- how much would you pay for a bloody sock ? a man named @entity5 paid $ 92,613			2
admittedly , it was n't just any old sock			2
it was the sock worn by @entity9 during game 2 of the @entity11			1
he pitched for the @entity13 against the @entity14 on an injured ankle			1
" it 's a one - of - a - kind item , " said @entity16 , director of @entity17			0
the stained white tube sock was sold at auction saturday night at the @entity21 in @entity0			2
" i expected anywhere from $ 75,000 to many multiples of that			0
it 's the first bloody sock we 've sold , and it came in just under what we expected to get for it			0
i 'm happy with the sale , " @entity30 said			0
although the auctioned item was worn in the @entity33 , the blood - stained sock that @entity9 had worn five days earlier is arguably an even bigger part of @entity13 lore			1
that night , the right - hander underwent an impromptu operation so that he could take the mound against @entity13 's archrival , the @entity40 , in game 6 of the @entity42			1
a loss would have sent the @entity13 home for the postseason -- without a championship , as had been the case since 1918 -- while a win would put them on the verge of an unprecedented postseason comeback from a 3 - 0 deficit , assuming they could take @entity53			1
they made it thanks largely to @entity9 , who was already hobbling after a subpar performance in the series ' first game			1
as blood soaked his white sock , he held the vaunted @entity40 lineup to one run and four hits over seven innings			0
the @entity13 ended up taking their fourth straight game the next day , pummeling @entity0 10 - 3 , to advance to the @entity33			1
there , they faced @entity14			2
despite his injuries , @entity9 started game 2 and helped lead the @entity13 to a 6 - 2 win			1
they ended up sweeping the @entity14 in four straight games , setting off a wave of euphoria in @entity74 , and finally ending the " @entity75			1
" @entity5 , who was born and raised in @entity76 , @entity0 , said he and his business partners have bought many items over the years and hope to open a museum about the history of baseball			0
the bloody sock will be a welcome addition			0
" it 's a very historic item			0
we also bought , about 10 years ago , the contract that brought @entity87 from the @entity13 to the @entity40			2
that started the ' @entity75 , ' and @entity9 's sock had a lot to do with ending it			1
it 's a great combination and it 's an honor to have it			0
to have something that is involved with both is very historic , " @entity5 said			0
@entity1 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
