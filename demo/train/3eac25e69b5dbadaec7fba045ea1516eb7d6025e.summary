@entity1 's @entity0 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			2
our trip around the " @entity9 " table was rich with 2014 insights , including a key test in @entity12 and questions about whether a @entity16 @entity15 majority would bring a new chapter in president @entity19 's relationship with the man he may face in many high - stakes negotiations			1
a ripple or a wave ? in the @entity25 , the 2014 margin matters there is little drama about control of the @entity25 : @entity16 are all but certain to hold -- and build -- their majority			1
modest gains for the @entity16 , and maybe the @entity32 sweep back into power in 2016 ; larger gains and perhaps we see a @entity16 majority until after the post- 2020 @entity38 redistricting			1
@entity39 of the @entity40 took us inside the calculations , and showed how the results could impact the next step for the @entity16 in charge of the @entity25 campaign effort			1
" if they get 12 to 15 ( seats ) or even beyond that , it could make it really hard for @entity32 to retake the @entity25 until they redraw the lines after 2020 , " said @entity39			1
" i talked to the chairman of the ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 , on saturday , and he lowballed the gains to me at six to eight			0
most folks think it will be a little higher than that			0
" " and notably , by the way , chairman @entity54 said he wants to stay at the @entity53			0
there 's been chatter about him being forced out			2
he said : ' i 'm staying			0
mr. president , meet @entity63 @entity19 and @entity16 sen. @entity63 of @entity64 served together in the @entity15 , and of course have been political rivals for the past six years			1
democrats point to the pledge from @entity69 early in the @entity19 administration to do all he could to make the president a one - term commander in chief			1
but despite being on the opposite sides of big political battles -- or maybe because of that fact -- the two have a virtually nonexistent personal relationship			0
even less interaction -- and familiarity -- than the president has with @entity25 speaker @entity81			2
@entity82 of the @entity83 noted that this would be the most important relationship in @entity86 if @entity69 becomes the @entity15 majority leader come january			1
he raised the question of whether the two will make mutual efforts to get to know each other better			0
will @entity32 see encouraging signs , or learn " do n't mess with @entity12 " ? @entity32 hopes of winning the @entity12 governor 's race have faded , big - time			0
but the party still has a lot at stake in tuesday 's election , which will add new data to the debate about whether the state 's shifting demographics are moving the state away from its @entity16 red roots			1
@entity107 of the @entity83 reported that @entity32 are hoping , even while expecting defeat in the state 's top race , to see building blocks of a new @entity12 coalition			0
" democrats have poured roughly $ 10 million into that campaign as part of @entity12 -- really hoping to change the makeup of the electorate , " said @entity113			0
" if that electorate is n't changed come tuesday , @entity16 are going to have something to crow about			2
and it will send a message to @entity32 -- do n't mess with @entity12 , at least no time soon			0
waiting for @entity123 until march , april or may ? the 2016 presidential campaign has been a big subplot of the 2014 midterm season , but will get even more attention once all the votes are counted tuesday			2
and some @entity32 think the best thing @entity130 could do for the party is to end the suspense , if there is any , and officially declare she is running			2
others , though , say why rush , given her overwhelming advantage among @entity32			0
@entity1 's @entity137 took us inside a debate that is about to get a lot more attention			0
" that big galaxy of people around her are debating should she get in early , very quickly , deny oxygen to any potential challenger , build an organization so she can start raising money , hiring staff , polling , et cetera -- or should she wait until the spring , " said @entity137			0
" i talked to one @entity153 who said she should wait until march , april or may because she does n't have to get into the mix and answer questions from reporters and take every arrow coming at her from the media or @entity16			1
two big wins for @entity19 , but deep gains for the @entity16 @entity16 complain about @entity19 with every breath , but you can make a case they will miss him			1
yes , the president has won two convincing @entity167 victories , and in the process exposed profound @entity16 demographic weaknesses when it comes to presidential politics			2
but down the ballot , the @entity19 years have been boom times for the @entity16			1
consider the " then " and " now " at several levels : democrats had 257 @entity25 seats and the majority at the beginning of @entity19 's term ; now they are in the minority , with 201			1
there were 27 @entity32 governors at the beginning ; 21 now			0
the number of @entity32 in state legislatures -- a key proving ground for future stars -- is down a whopping 600 over the past six years			0
in the @entity15 , this year 's biggest battleground , the change is less dramatic : 57 @entity32 senators early in the @entity19 presidency , 53 now , or 55 if you count the two independents who caucus with the @entity32			1
any president 's party normally take a big hit in the so - called " six - year itch " midterm , so it will be worth looking again at those numbers in a week			0
but if @entity16 fail to take control of the @entity15 , given the favorable climate and map this year , the political conversation is likely to be as much , if not more , about the @entity16 's damaged brand as it is about the numbers showing how the party has prospered these past six years .			1

the @entity16 margin in the @entity25 could determine *congressional* control until 2020
how @entity19 and @entity69 's relationship could change if @entity16 takes control
waiting for @entity130 's *announcement* until march , april or may ?
