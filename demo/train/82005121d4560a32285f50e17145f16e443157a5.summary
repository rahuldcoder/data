editor 's note : @entity2 is author of " @entity2 : how the @entity4 undermines the @entity5 " and is senior research fellow at the @entity7 , a think tank at the @entity9 , @entity9 , that has focused on gender , sexuality and the military			1
he also teaches on the adjunct faculty at @entity14			0
@entity2 says there 's no evidence that letting gays serve openly would harm the military			1
( @entity19 ) -- this week , four senior retired officers wrote an op - ed in the @entity22 predicting " grave harm " to the military if president @entity23 moves forward with his vow to let gays serve openly			1
" our experience , " they wrote , " and that of more than 1,000 retired flag and general officers , " suggest that lifting the ban would harm unit cohesion , recruitment and retention , and would ultimately " break the @entity32			1
" the argument is an old one , and was an effective canard in defeating president @entity40 's move to lift the ban in 1993			0
but it has never been rooted in fact or evidence , and the effort of these officers to defeat equal treatment this time around will face mountains of opposing data and a dramatically changed cultural landscape			0
the officers who oppose openly gay service do not base their arguments on any new information			1
in addition to their own experience -- an impressive credential that 's nevertheless too vague to hang an argument on -- the officers rely on a single poll			0
they cite an unscientific survey -- it does not draw from a representative sampling but from newspaper subscribers -- indicating that 58 percent of the military oppose lifting the ban and that , if it 's lifted , 24 percent claim they will leave or consider leaving after their tour ends			1
but it 's na√Øve at best , and disingenuous at worst , to confuse this opinion survey with a sound prediction of actual behavior			0
when both @entity76 and @entity77 proposed lifting their gay bans in the 1990s , similar opinion surveys found much higher numbers -- about two - thirds in both cases -- claiming they , too , would leave			2
in each case , no more than three departures were attributed to the policy change			0
in fact , the evidence showing that openly gay service works is overwhelming			1
since 1957 , when the @entity90 military began doing its own studies on gays in the military , every last bit of research has shown that openly gay service works			1
studies of foreign militaries include a 1993 @entity97 study of allied nations that found that " the presence of homosexuals in the military is not an issue and has not created problems in the functioning of military units " ; a 1994 assessment by the @entity107 for the @entity109 finding that predicted negative consequences of ending gay exclusion in the @entity112 never materialized ; the 2000 assessment of the @entity76 @entity114 , calling its new policy of equal treatment " a solid achievement " with " no discernible impact " on recruitment or other critical variables ; and four academic studies conducted by the @entity7 , where i work , finding that lifting bans in @entity76 , @entity124 , @entity77 and @entity125 had no negative impact on military readiness , including on recruitment and retention			1
the officers writing in the @entity22 question the relevance of foreign militaries to this debate , mocking the idea that the @entity90 military " must emulate @entity135 , the @entity136 and @entity77			2
" but they failed to note that 24 of our closest allies let gays serve openly , including @entity76 , whose combat - tested soldiers and sailors serve shoulder to shoulder with @entity90 forces			2
while our military and culture are unique in the world , it 's an astonishing vote of no - confidence in @entity90 troops to say that they are not capable of doing what 24 other militaries have done successfully			2
ours is a professional , disciplined fighting force , and the assertion that a diverse military would lack order and discipline is , as rep. @entity157 , an @entity158 veteran , has said , " an insult " to him and the entire @entity90 military			0
but it 's not just foreign militaries that provide real evidence on gay service			1
a majority of @entity90 troops know of , or suspect , gays in their units , giving the lie to the most basic assumption underlying the gay ban : that openly gay service could never work			1
after all , gays are already serving , and serving openly , without causing problems			0
yet despite the law 's failure to keep many open gays out , the ban 's persistence means that gay troops are subject to random dismissals and are often unable to access military support services for fear of being found out and fired			1
even extensive research by our own military has concluded the gay ban is unnecessary , including a large 1993 study by the @entity189 -- a think tank created by the military itself -- and two official military studies -- a 1989 study by the @entity195 and the @entity198 's 1957 @entity197 report -- which all found sexual orientation is irrelevant to military performance			2
indeed , neither the military nor anyone else has ever turned up a shred of evidence tying openly gay service to impairment of the military			1
when the officers ' claims are pitted against the wealth of actual facts and research on this issue , they are shown for what they really are : fear and intolerance , rooted in a world that 's largely disappeared			0
indeed , the vast majority of these retired officers , including the authors of this week 's op - ed , retired before the current " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy even began in 1994			2
their military is not the same as today 's , where three - quarters of troops are " personally comfortable " with gays and lesbians , and " do n't ask , do n't tell " is considered " a joke			1
" these officers attribute current efforts to lift the ban to " gay rights activists , " when in fact , according to consistent polling , four - fifths of the @entity90 public favors repeal , including majorities of @entity239 , conservatives and even churchgoers			2
it also includes many retired officers who did serve under , and used to support , the current policy , such as gen. @entity245 , former chairman of the @entity246 , who sees the ban as a threat to military readiness			1
the officers say there is " no compelling national security reason " to accept the " risks " of lifting the ban , which they say include the likely loss of " experienced personnel who are not easily replaced			0
" but under current policy , more than 800 " mission - critical specialists " have been fired just because they 're gay , including more than 60 @entity261 linguists			0
due to the military 's overall struggle to meet its recruiting goals , it has had to lower standards and admit convicted felons			0
kicking out capable troops while replacing them with ex-convicts is not a recipe for good order and discipline			0
forcing soldiers to lie to each other is not good for morale or cohesion			0
drumming out @entity261 linguists at a time when we do n't have enough to translate what our enemies are saying is bad , not good , for national security			0
if these officers care more about our nation than about preserving an embalmed military culture , they 'll cease and desist			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity2			0

@entity2 : some retired military officers oppose letting gay troops serve
he says they do n't understand wide *acceptance* of gays today in military
he says many other nations have *approved* gay service without harm
@entity304 : polls vastly *exaggerate* number of officers who might leave
