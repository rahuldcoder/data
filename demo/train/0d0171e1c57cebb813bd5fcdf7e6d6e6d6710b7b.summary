-- high level workers are looking for an alternative to the 9 to 5			1
armed with years of experience , a growing number of professionals are looking to fashion project - based careers where the monotony of office life is exchanged for a varied and tailored work schedule			1
@entity11 , the brainchild of @entity13 , works with nearly 300 companies to provide projects for its highly experienced pool of workers			1
roping in opportunities from sectors such as @entity21 , the ' full - time ' employee may be a role of the past			1
@entity0 : what is the landscape like for employee recruitment ? @entity13 : typically , companies that have to get work done have two ways they look at it : one is that they usually hire full - time employees or they can go out to firms , consulting firms , outsourcing firms and have them do work			1
in fact , there 's a growing population of people who prefer to work independently and create a project - based career , and those people are fantastic			1
companies are now understanding that they can harness this group of talent to create exactly the team that they need to get their work done , and then disband that team and put another team in place			2
@entity0 : has there been a shift in how people view their work life ? @entity58 : i think you 're seeing two different things happening			1
on the talent side , we 're seeing three demographic trends : we 're seeing baby boomers retiring , we 're seeing women increasingly joining the workforce , and we 're seeing @entity68 who want a different relationship between work and life			2
these three demographic trends are driving more and more people into the independent talent market			0
@entity0 : what kind of people are in the talent pool ? @entity58 : the talent pool has about 3,500 professionals , and those people are coming to @entity11 for one reason - they want great projects			1
they want to be able to say " i want to do this but do n't want to do this "			0
these people are very senior people , these are people who have mbas and have experience at the best firms in the world - people who really value great work			2
so it 's not just about finding a senior executive and putting them in a permanent job and it 's not just about going into an expensive outside firm			0
this is a new resource			0
@entity0 : how is the @entity11 different from other talent pools ? @entity58 : the thing that 's revolutionary about what we 're trying to do is that we 're introducing a model that has worked in other segments into the very highest echelons of corporate @entity107			2
so we 're taking very top consultants and very top executives and enabling them to work in a different way			0
so it 's all in their control			0
i want companies to feel like there 's a reliable source for this kind of talent so they can bake this into their planning			0
our best clients actually budget independent talent into their next year 's planning because they know now that there are great people in this pool that they can rely on			0
