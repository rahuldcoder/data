crews have found the bodies of the @entity3 pilots killed in last month 's downing of their jet by @entity6 , an incident that prompted an outbreak of hostile rhetoric between the two nations that continued wednesday			1
@entity6 president @entity13 , in an interview published in the @entity3 newspaper @entity12 wednesday , lambasted @entity3 prime minister @entity14 for interfering in @entity6 internal politics			1
and @entity3 's foreign minister disputed some of @entity13 's assertions tuesday about the downing of the jet			1
@entity6 shot down the @entity22 jet on june 22 , intensifying the animosity between the countries , whose once - close relationship has eroded since the @entity13 regime begain cracking down on opposition forces 16 months ago			1
" we would never allow outsiders to interfere in our affairs , " @entity13 told the newspaper			1
" this initial desire to interfere in our internal affairs , unfortunately , made @entity3 a party in all the bloody activities in the later process			1
@entity3 has supplied all kinds of logistic support to the terrorists who kill our people			1
" @entity42 : i wish the @entity3 jet shootdown did n't happen @entity42 accused @entity14 of " acting with sectarian impulses			1
" most of the populations of @entity3 and @entity6 are @entity48 , but the @entity13 regime is dominated by @entity50 , an offshoot of @entity52			1
@entity14 , whose government is hosting @entity55 opposition groups and thousands of @entity6 refugees fleeing @entity6 's violence , wants " terrorists to be free in @entity6 , " @entity13 said , asserting that the prime minister is " very excited about the @entity61 movement in @entity6 " -- a @entity48 movement			1
" the impulse to help and defend @entity61 constituted the real starting point and basis of the @entity6 policy that @entity14 has been following , " @entity13 said , accusing the @entity3 prime minister of a setting a double standard in his foreign policies			1
" for example , why does he cry for the @entity6 people in a hypocritical way but ( is ) not crying for those killed in the @entity76 countries ? " he asked			2
" why does n't he meddle with the democracy problems of those countries ? " @entity42 's published comments came as the @entity3 military reported finding the bodies of the two @entity3 pilots of the downed jet			1
the bodies of capt. @entity89 and first lt. @entity90 were " found at the bottom " of the @entity87 , " shot by @entity6 in the international waters , " the military said in a statement			2
@entity3 crews were working to retrieve the bodies , the military said			2
in the first installment of the interview with the @entity6 president , published tuesday in @entity12 , @entity13 expressed regret over the plane incident			1
he said his soldiers had thought it was an @entity102 warplane			0
" the @entity3 people are our brothers and something that would make them sad would never make me happy and it did not			2
if this was an @entity102 plane , of course , i would have been happy , " he said			0
the plane was using the same flight corridor that @entity102 planes had used three times before , he said			0
" since we could n't see it on our radars and no information was given either , the soldiers downed it			0
we learned that it belonged to @entity3 after shooting it down			2
" but @entity3 foreign minister @entity122 , in an interview with the @entity3 newspaper , asked , " how many times have they fired at an @entity102 plane before ? moreover , they are legally at war with @entity102			1
that they launched such an attack on our plane even when no such attack has been launched against an @entity102 plane shows that they do not have any goodwill towards us			0
" @entity122 also disputed @entity13 on the radar claim			2
" either the @entity6 air defense is not as powerful as he claims or what he says is a clear lie			2
as soon as our plane takes off from @entity142 , all the countries in the area can monitor the movements of it			0
this is not a secret but an open mission , and the profile of the flight is one that can be monitored by countries even with the simplest airspace systems			0
it is also wrong that they say they could n't determine its identity because we also have records that they identified it			0
" they say we would not shoot it down if we knew it was a @entity3 plane			2
let 's say they did n't know the @entity166 was a @entity3 plane , then why did they open fire on the @entity170 plane that was going for help ? it was obvious that it was coming from @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity3 scrambles jets as @entity6 choppers near border @entity122 said he agreed with just one of the comments made by @entity13 in the tuesday interview			1
" that is when he says , ' if i knew it would be for the good of my country , i would n't stay even for a day			0
' that is very correct and he should do what this requires as soon as possible			0
he should not stay there even for a day , " @entity122 said			0
meanwhile , at least 70 people -- including 10 children and three women -- were killed wednesday in @entity6 , opposition activists said			1
the carnage has spiked in recent days , with at least 109 people killed sunday , 114 people monday and 71 tuesday , opposition activists said			0
the regime maintains it is fighting against " armed terrorist groups			0
" opposition activists and many world leaders say regime forces have been attacking cities nationwide in an attempt to wipe out dissidents seeking @entity13 's ouster			1
his family has ruled @entity6 for more than 40 years			2
this week , @entity6 authorities " stormed terrorists dens " in the @entity213 countryside and seized a warehouse containing explosive devices , the state - run @entity208 reported wednesday			2
@entity216 can not independently confirm the reports of casualties or violence because @entity6 restricts access by international journalists			2
@entity6 opposition leaders who have been meeting in @entity223 said they support the rebel @entity224 and oppose negotiations with the @entity13 regime			1
they said they believe @entity229 and @entity230 envoy @entity228 's six - point peace plan needs to be strengthened so it can be executed effectively			0
the opposition supports @entity228 's plan in theory , but say it has to be improved			0
that sentiment comes on the heels of a plan laid out by global diplomats in @entity238 over the weekend that called for a transitional government to be established			0
according to the plan , backed by @entity247 and @entity248 as well as the @entity249 , such a government " could include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent			0
" the @entity6 @entity251 issued a statement of general support for the plan , but did n't address the transitional government issue			0
" we have noticed the vagueness of several points in the final document , which need explanation , " the ministry said			0
" however , since the participants adhere to the fact that the @entity6 population alone is the final decision maker with regards to its future with no foreign intervention , then all matters are negotiable in a national dialogue			1
" more than 14,000 people -- most of them civilians -- have been killed since the @entity6 uprising began 16 months ago , opposition groups said			1
a spokesman for the opposition @entity275 said wednesday that the group had tallied the total killed at 16,757			0
of them , 11,657 were civilians , 4,227 were members of the military or security forces and 873 were defectors or members of the opposition @entity224 , said @entity286 , the spokesman			0
opinion : tracking down torture in @entity6 report describes torture in @entity6 new attempt to end @entity6 bloodshed brings optimism , doubt			0

@entity42 accuses @entity3 of interfering in @entity6 's internal affairs
