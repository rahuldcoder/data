@entity0 -- well , that settles it : @entity5 ' @entity4 must be straight			1
not that i spent time thinking about his sexual orientation before but that 's the first thing that popped in my mind when the legendary newsman , in critiquing president @entity12 's inauguration speech , said , " there were no real memorable lines			1
" maybe not for straight people , but there were not a whole lot of gay people who will forget this : " our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well			1
" that was the first time the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community was mentioned in inaugural address			1
i 'd say that passage was pretty memorable			2
and while we 've all heard this president mention the rights of gays in speeches before -- what was unique about the inauguration , what really moved me and a lot of people engaged in this particular struggle , was this : " we , the people , declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still ; just as it guided our forebears through @entity51 , and @entity52 , and @entity53			1
" @entity51 refers to the first women 's rights convention held in @entity51 , @entity55 , in 1848			1
his mention of @entity52 was a nod to the civil rights march in @entity52 , @entity60 , in 1965			2
and @entity53 ? after years of being harassed by police , even arrested for dressing differently or simply walking down the street , the patrons of the @entity62 finally had enough			0
so after another humiliating raid at a @entity67 bar by the name of @entity62 , they fought back			0
that was june 28 , 1969			0
that moment is credited with being the single most important event in the gay rights movement			1
significant cultural change had begun			0
in mentioning @entity53 , with not only the nation , but the world watching , @entity12 gave more than a passing acknowledgment to a group of people who were instrumental to his re-election			1
he stopped , looked us in the eyes , and said : i see you			0
maybe if you 've never had to worry about not being promoted " if someone found out " ; maybe if you 've never had to switch pronouns or leave your better half at home for fear of being fired ; maybe if you 've never had to worry about health insurance for your children or pay extra taxes because your state does n't recognize your family ; maybe if you 've never sat in a church and had a preacher tell you that your family is n't a family at all , that your loving relationship is wrong , that who you are is inherently wrong , then i could see how someone could view the president 's speech as lacking in memorable lines			1
but the @entity108 ' spouses recently offered the wife of an @entity111 lieutenant colonel an invitation to join the group as a " special guest " -- not as a spouse -- for one reason : sexual orientation			0
so despite being legally married , despite a 15 - year relationship , despite the overturning of " @entity120 , " the blatant discrimination and bullying of @entity124 people continues			2
so the mentioning of @entity53 did not pass by everyone 's ears unnoticed			2
in fact as i made my way from the frozen lawn in front of the @entity134 , past the parade route and eventually to one of the evening 's balls , it was clear to me that the passage in @entity12 's speech was more than a memorable line			1
it was a rallying cry			0
that 's not to say the work is done but rather @entity144 , and @entity145 and @entity146 and the countless souls who have since moved on , did not fight for this notion of full equality , in vain			2
it took 44 presidents , 57 inaugurations and 224 years before the @entity124 community was mentioned in an inauguration speech -- but the community was finally mentioned			0
that seems pretty memorable to me			0
at the beginning of the ceremony , sen. @entity160 drew our attention to the construction of the @entity134 , particularly the @entity165 that stands at the top of the dome			0
he pointed out it was a freed slave , @entity169 , who helped to cast the bronze statue , which was placed there december 2 , 1863 , not even a year after president @entity173 signed the @entity174			0
to hear that story on @entity179 , as the nation 's first black president was being sworn in for a second time , was a reminder to all of us that at times equality can feel like a slow train coming ... but we can not grow weary because it is coming			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			1
