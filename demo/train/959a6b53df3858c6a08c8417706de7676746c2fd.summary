-- from superstorms to floods , to historic heat waves and droughts , not a week goes by without a major disruption somewhere in our communities			1
between 2011 and 2013 , 48 states and two - thirds of @entity11 counties endured crises severe enough to be declared major disasters			1
of course , these events are n't preventable , but there are often steps we can take to change how we prepare and respond			0
indeed , with the right preparation , not every extreme weather disruption has to become a disaster			1
@entity21 underscores what can be done			0
the deadly 2012 storm was devastating for communities along the @entity25			2
but the @entity26 and the @entity27 asked the question : what if we focused on planning and preparing as much as we do on disaster reaction and response ? so we partnered to create rebuild by @entity34 , a competition that brings together engineering and design experts with public , philanthropic and community organizations to try to find ways of rebuilding that make communities like those affected in @entity43 and @entity44 more environmentally and economically resilient			1
and now the competition is hitting the national stage , with the @entity26 - led $ 1 billion @entity46 , which is aimed at encouraging local businesses , community development organizations , nonprofits , and local and state governments to rethink how cities plan in the face of a growing number of natural disasters			1
in november , we convened a summit of leaders from 67 competing states , cities , counties and parishes			0
now , government officials and civic leaders as well as engineers , architects and urban planners will participate in boot camp - like resilience academies to understand best practices before they submit their proposals			2
the first one , designed for the challenges facing the @entity71 in particular , is being held this week in @entity72 , followed by other dedicated regional academies across the country in the new year			0
this billion - dollar investment turns the traditional idea of disaster relief on its head			1
for years , communities have received federal recovery funds after the fact -- when they were knocked on their heels by a disaster			1
unsurprisingly , this is also a particularly expensive way of doing business			0
this new approach , in contrast , will ultimately save communities millions in long - term costs			2
the @entity90 suggests that every dollar we invest in resilience before a disaster saves $ 4 after the fact			1
so , in a way , this was an idea that we could n't afford not to do			0
we call the philosophy behind this competition the " resilience dividend , " and it pays off by improving our everyday lives in the good times , too			1
take @entity103 , @entity104 , which over the last century has often experienced flooding			0
since the city began planting parks in floodplains and changing the way it designs its buildings , @entity103 's residents have been paying some of the lowest insurance rates in the country and worrying less about losing their homes and property			0
the quality of their lives and their sense of economic security has grown			0
or consider @entity121 , @entity122			0
after a bout of historic rainstorms there , a public - private partnership designed storm drains that double as bicycle trails , floodgates doubling as transportation routes , and recreation areas that protect water quality			0
and @entity134 , which was devastated by flooding from @entity136 10 years ago next year , reimagined its economic base in rebuilding itself , encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship and creative and sustainable development			0
a decade after large areas were submerged , @entity134 is recognized as a hotbed for startups and one of @entity11 's most resilient cities			2
rebuild by @entity34 is succeeding not only because of the creativity of the projects , but also due to the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of engineers , architects , planners and , importantly , local communities -- all of which partnered in unprecedented ways			1
of crucial value , the teams spent considerable time on the ground in these communities , building critical trust and listening to citizens about their needs			2
for example , one of the winning groups in the competition proposed a 10 - mile flood barrier to protect @entity170 -- called the " @entity171 " -- that would not only be functional and effective , but also aesthetically appealing			2
drawing on local input , the design incorporated green space , bike paths , art and community markets that create economic opportunity in underdeveloped areas , all while protecting against future flooding			1
building resilience is a process with no ideology : natural disasters in our country are destroying @entity189 and @entity190 communities alike			1
but the @entity46 is providing common - sense solutions that create common ground on which to work together			2
the time to embrace resilience is now .			0

@entity197 and @entity198 : disasters hurt @entity189 , @entity190 communities alike
each dollar invested in resilience before a disaster saves $ 4 after the fact , they note
@entity26 and @entity27 partner to create rebuild by design
the competition looks for ways to rebuild that make communities more resilient
