@entity0 -- a year ago , @entity3 's new generation of leaders strode out onto a stage in the cavernous @entity6 in @entity7			1
they were led by @entity9 , who took over from @entity10 as head of the @entity12 , which has ruled @entity3 for more than 60 years			1
@entity1 asked three analysts for their verdict on @entity9 's first year at @entity3 's helm in three key areas : domestic politics , the environment and the economy			1
domestic politics : a fiery start @entity22 is director of research and a senior fellow at @entity26 's @entity25			0
the @entity3 saying " a new leader lights three bonfires " vividly captures the momentum and accomplishments of @entity9 's first year as party boss			1
each of these " three bonfires " --- - the vigorous anti-corruption campaign , the successful conclusion of thetrial of disgraced politician @entity38 , and the comprehensive and deeper market reforms embraced at the third plenum -- have granted him much needed public support and significantly consolidated his power			1
from the first day of his tenure as general secretary of the party , he admitted to the public that the rampancy of official corruption was ruining the party and the country			2
with @entity50 , his most important political ally in the @entity51 , @entity9 launched a tough anti-corruption campaign			1
within a year , 11 ministerial and provincial - level senior leaders were arrested , including leaders within the country 's most formidable special interest groups like the oil industry			2
some critics may be cynical about the methods employed in the anti-corruption campaign , but the campaign has already transformed the behavior of @entity3 officials			0
@entity9 should be credited with the successful completion of the @entity38 trial , which was the largest legitimacy crisis for the party since the 1989 @entity69 incident and widely perceived to be a " no - win " situation for the @entity12 leadership			1
the scandal revealed the fact that some high - ranking @entity12 leaders like @entity38 -- @entity3 's @entity75 -- have decadent lifestyles filled with sex , money laundering , and even murder			1
@entity9 and his colleagues handled the case wisely in three aspects : first , they focused on @entity38 's corruption , not on his other unlawful behavior			1
second , they used social media micro-blogging to disseminate the details of the courtroom proceedings , thus undermining criticism of lack of openness			0
and third , @entity38 's verdict of life imprisonment seemed to be appropriate , neither too severe nor too lenient			2
most importantly , @entity9 wants to leave a strong mark on the economic front			1
he has embraced as his mandate the " @entity3 dream , " defined as the rejuvenation of the @entity3 nation and the opportunity to realize a middle - class lifestyle			0
the overall objective of his new economic policy , as evident from the third plenum , is to make the private sector the " decisive driver " of the @entity3 economy , to make the @entity3 middle class happy , and to allow more members of the lower class to attain middle class status			2
while @entity9 's above three bonfires have resonated well among the general public , there are some valid worries about @entity9 and his rapidly growing power			1
@entity9 's politically conservative -- and sometimes even @entity120 - style -- approach that has relied on tight political control and media censorship has alienated the country 's liberal intellectuals			1
his broad and strong anti-corruption campaign may also alienate a large number of officials -- the very power base on which the party relies			0
the environment : promises but few results @entity133 is the founder and editor of www.chinadialogue.net , a bilingual @entity3 @entity137 website devoted to building a shared approach on climate change and environmental issues with @entity3			0
she graduated from the @entity141 with an honors ma in @entity3 , and in 1973 was one of the first @entity145 students to study in @entity3			0
there was not much cheer for environmentalists in the meeting that was billed as the most significant of @entity9 's administration			1
at the close of the @entity12 's @entity153 on november 13 , @entity3 's official news agency , @entity151 , failed even to list the environment among its key points , focusing instead on the promise of economic reform			1
@entity9 has recognized that prioritizing economic growth for 30 years has brought @entity3 to the edge of environmental collapse and he has promised to give environment the same weight as economic development			1
but 2013 was a year of dramatically worsening air pollution and mounting public frustration at the government 's apparent inability to halt @entity3 's deforestation , maritime pollution , desertification and water and soil pollution			1
@entity9 said @entity3 must build what it calls " ecological civilization " -- a top - level slogan that officials are still struggling to flesh out			1
he talked of " establishing a complete system " of ecological civilization , promised to improve the management of natural resources , and to establish " red lines " in ecological protection , along with ecological compensation for pollution victims			0
it is how these and other promises shape up that will decide @entity9 's environmental legacy			1
so far , his government has announced plans to clean up lethal air pollution but they will take many years to take effect			0
in other respects , environmental protection risks clashing with other concerns : a new @entity197 that is moving slowly through @entity3 's parliament threatens serious financial penalties for polluting companies , but has also been heavily criticized for restricting the rights of @entity202 to take legal action against polluters , as @entity9 tightens the state 's control of civil society			2
it also plays a role in the rising incidence of protest and chronic rural poverty , which president @entity9 has promised to reverse			2
the environment could benefit from @entity9 's commitment to a greater role for the market , which might boost @entity3 's pilot carbon - trading schemes , and from his promise of a stronger legal system and greater transparency			1
high - level promises set the policy direction , but @entity9 's environmental record will be judged by results			2
key issues include cleaning up @entity3 's @entity227 , boosting the @entity228 and putting it in charge of the provincial and local bureaus , building a robust , legally enforced system of fines for polluters and lifting restrictions on @entity3 's tightly controlled environmental ngos			0
the economy : welcome shift @entity239 is chief @entity3 economist at @entity240 and a former @entity241 and @entity243 economist			2
under the new leadership , we have seen a welcome shift towards a more comprehensive approach to reform			0
this was underlined by the decisions made during last week 's @entity153 to recalibrate the role of the government , with less direct intervention and more facilitation of the market and provision of public services			0
we have also witnessed a move towards more emphasis on the sustainability and quality of growth , as opposed to simply the rate of growth			0
during the slowdown that @entity3 went through until the middle of this year , the leadership was more restrained than previously in rolling out stimulus measures , emphasizing that reform is more important than short - term stimulus			0
in a similar vein , the leadership is trying to put more emphasis on improving the quality of urbanization -- basically by allowing migrants to integrate into a proper urban life -- and the reforms needed to make that happen in areas such as the fiscal system and rural land arrangements			0
in spite of the arrival of new people at the top , the politics of reform in @entity3 's consensus - driven policymaking process has not changed			0
for instance , in the case of reforms related to state - run enterprises and the fiscal system , resistance remains as strong as ever			0
this has meant that progress on such reforms has been slow so far although , in a promising move , the leadership is now trying to overcome such political obstacles by introducing a " leading group " with a mandate to coordinate and push the reform agenda			0
all in all , on the economic front the new leadership has made a reasonably promising start			0
in the coming two years , i would expect to see pretty good progress on reform in those areas where the political economy is favorable , which is the case in the financial and monetary area , as well as on pricing and taxation of resources			2
on the other hand , in the areas of state - owned enterprises , fiscal reform and rural land arrangements , i would expect progress to remain slower in the coming two years .			0

@entity9 took power one year ago , becoming head of the @entity12
three analysts give their verdict on how key areas have fared under his watch
domestically , @entity9 has found public support and significantly consolidated his power
the economy has seen a welcome shift but there has been little cheer for the environment
