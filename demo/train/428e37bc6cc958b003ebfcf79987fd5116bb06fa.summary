@entity2 warrior @entity0 has long been a controversial figure , so perhaps it 's only appropriate that his memorial follow suit			1
though he 's best known for fighting against @entity7 at the @entity8 , @entity0 led his tribe numerous times against settlers and miners in the @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 and elsewhere before his 1877 death at @entity18 's @entity17			1
but forget his disputed role in that battle or the claims that he 's never been photographed or the conflicting tales of how he met his end -- the real mystery is more contemporary : when is the sculpture in his honor going to be complete ? in the mountains of @entity28 , @entity29 , rests the @entity0			1
it pays tribute to the native american war hero with a sculpture that , at many times the size of nearby @entity35 , will one day constitute the world 's largest mountain carving			1
that is , if it ever gets completed			0
though the project has been ongoing since 1948 , it 's far from finished , and there is n't a rush because ... well , there is n't a deadline			1
" the organization is not trying to be difficult or using delaying tactics , " said @entity46 , spokesman for the @entity0			1
" there are project unknowns and circumstances beyond control that influence the work			2
" he lists harsh weather -- including lightning storms and blizzards -- and the mountain 's high iron content , which makes the rock tougher to carve , as factors that have put a halt on the sculpting progress			2
that 's not to mention that the sculpture will stand 563 feet tall , a few feet higher than the @entity66			1
creator shuns assistance another factor is funding			0
according to @entity46 , the @entity0 sculpture is a nonprofit project and is funded entirely by admission fees and donations			1
" there were offers by elected government officials and high - ranking department appointees to seek funding as amendments to bills for other federal legislation , " said @entity46			2
" however , ( @entity83 sculptor ) @entity82 turned them down			0
he did not believe the government would complete the carving			2
" @entity82 saw the @entity88 government as flaky when it came to making agreements , @entity46 said , adding @entity82 was dismayed by the 1868 @entity90 , which handed the @entity28 over to the @entity2 but required their children have an " @entity94 education " and failed to address gold rights , resulting in years of conflict			0
the government seized the @entity28 nine years later , and the ensuing court battles continued for more than a century			0
@entity46 said @entity82 was also troubled by @entity35 sculptor @entity99 's struggle with federal officials over funding and control of the @entity88 landmark			1
despite these factors that prompted @entity82 to spurn government assistance , it should be noted that @entity35 was completed after only 14 years			0
the @entity107 reported in may that admission fees totaled $ 3.8 million in 2010 , and the memorial received more than $ 19 million in donations over the last five years			2
some @entity111 , including descendants of @entity0 , think with numbers like that the monument should already be finished			1
@entity115 , whose great - grandmother was @entity0 's aunt , has mixed feelings about the memorial			1
in an interview with @entity120 , he said the monument could serve future generations and may be the @entity88 equivalent to the @entity125 monoliths			2
" maybe 300 or 400 years from now , everything will be gone , we 'll all be gone , and they 'll be the four faces in the @entity28 and the statue there symbolizing the @entity111 who were here at one time , " @entity115 said			2
the @entity125 monoliths have long been considered one of the world 's great mysteries			2
@entity136 settlers to the island built the giant volcanic - stone figures , and while they are thought to pay homage to deities or ancestors , no one knows exactly what they represent			0
the sculpture of a lifetime @entity82 began carving the @entity0 monument seven years after the completion of @entity35			1
chief @entity150 , then - leader of the @entity2 tribe , did n't like the four huge @entity88 faces peering over his people 's land , so he asked @entity155 if he could carve a monument in honor of a @entity159 legend			1
" my fellow chiefs and i would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes also , " @entity160 wrote in a 1939 letter to @entity82			0
@entity82 worked on the carving until his death in 1982 at age 74			0
his dying wish was for his wife @entity170 , now 86 , and their 10 children to finish the sculpture			2
@entity170 is president and ceo of the @entity175 , and seven of the children are working on it to this day			0
not everyone considers the sculpture an honor			0
in an interview with @entity120 , @entity183 , another descendant of @entity0 , said @entity160 had no right to order the monument			1
" they do n't respect our culture because we did n't give permission for someone to carve the sacred @entity28 where our burial grounds are , " @entity183 said			0
" they were there for us to enjoy and they were there for us to pray			0
but it was n't meant to be carved into images , which is very wrong for all of us			0
the more i think about it , the more it 's a desecration of our @entity111 culture			0
not just @entity0 , but all of us			1
" @entity204 , founder of the @entity205 , which is based in nearby @entity207 , told the @entity107 he has never heard " a single @entity159 say , ' i 'm proud of that mountain			0
' " there 's also disagreement over the depiction of @entity0 's face			1
though it 's a source of some dispute , many experts say there are no known photographs of @entity0 , and thus , creating a statue in his likeness is foolish			1
however , according to a biography provided by the @entity0 , the statue is not meant to be a rendition of @entity0			1
instead , it 's supposed to honor the spirit of @entity0			1
growing popularity ? @entity46 acknowledges that the " significance of the @entity0 and reaction to the mountain carving varies " among @entity111			1
however , he feels as though the perception of the mountain is getting better			0
" the growth of the memorial 's tribal flag collection to more than 120 banners from @entity88 and @entity236 tribes and groups indicates spreading popularity for @entity0 , " said @entity46			1
" the extent of applications for the limited openings in the summer university program is another indicator of support			0
" the tribal flags are given to the memorial as a sign of respect from the nation represented by the flag			0
it 's also a sign of " continuing support of the ongoing project , " @entity46 said			0
@entity254 of the @entity255 , which sent their flag to the @entity0 monument , praised the memorial for its historical significance			1
" we believe that education is a vital tool in helping the non-native communities understand who we are , " said @entity254 , director of the tribe 's historic preservation department			0
" it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the efforts being made by the @entity82 family , and we are grateful for their passion for all of us as @entity159 people			0
" the mountain also features other attractions besides the carving that " preserve " the @entity159 tradition , @entity46 said			0
there is the @entity279 of @entity280 , which contains more than 11,000 historic and contemporary objects and artworks from tribal groups ; the @entity284 , which houses a collection of historic prints , numerous regional artifacts and some hands - on activity displays ; and the recently opened @entity290 , which partners with the @entity291 and offers courses in native american studies			0
the @entity0 " anticipates continued expansion of the @entity111 university of @entity280 to include a medical training center , further development of the @entity279 of @entity280 and growth in its educational programs to enhance understanding of the varied @entity159 cultures , " @entity46 said			1
however , @entity115 feels like the money being spent on these buildings should be used solely on the statue			0
" when you start making money rather than to try to complete the project , that 's when , to me , it 's going off in the wrong direction , " @entity115 said in the @entity120 interview			2
' a project that will never end ... ' but the @entity313 have always insisted that this be a painstaking process -- " so you do it right " -- and the memorial website flatly states the memorial " is a project that will never end , even after the mountain carving is complete			2
" after 50 years of work , @entity0 's 87 - foot head was completed in 1998 , and work is presently being done to finish 219 - foot - tall head of the @entity159 warrior 's steed , according to the @entity313			1
when and if it 's complete , the entire monument will be 641 feet wide			1
in terms of size , @entity35 , just 17 miles away , has four 60 - foot heads , all of which can fit inside the lone head of @entity0			2
@entity335 died after being captured by enemy soldiers			0
as with most @entity0 - related lore , the exact time and manner of death are disputed , and even a highway sign near @entity342 , @entity29 , lists four possible resting places .			2

work on @entity0 began in 1948 ; it 's *unclear* when sculpture will be complete
monument is planned for 563 feet , a few feet taller than @entity66
despite early controversies over statue and *location* , memorial officials say image is improving
