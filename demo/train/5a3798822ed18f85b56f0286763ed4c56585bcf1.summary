@entity0 -- the uproar last week over a proposed campaign ad highlighting president @entity5 's former pastor , rev. @entity4 , lit up political circles before organizers finally backed off the idea			1
and @entity9 came under fire from evangelicals before his speech to @entity13 in @entity14 earlier this month because some at the traditional @entity17 school still believe @entity18 is a cult			2
two very different candidates joined by similar , yet hollow , attacks on their faith illustrate the intense mix of identity politics simmering just beneath the surface of the presidential race			1
when it comes to faith and race , there are some who want to paint both candidates as outside the mainstream , not members of the traditional @entity35 club			1
they want to paint them as " others			0
" both @entity5 , the nation 's first black president , and @entity9 , a @entity40 , have found that their shared status as members of minority groups and political pioneers , in many ways , has also changed the rules of this presidential campaign cycle , said @entity48 , co-editor of the anthology " @entity50 in @entity51			1
" " it 's the elephant in the room , " @entity48 said			1
" on the @entity57 side , the liability of raising ( @entity9 's ) @entity18 and putting it under closer scrutiny means they will be accused of religious intolerance			1
if ( @entity61 ) bring up @entity4 , they 'll be accused of using the race card			0
" so both presidential campaigns are adhering to a tenuous , unwritten hands - off agreement when it comes to race and religion even as they themselves struggle to navigate those waters			0
but the same rules may not neccesarily apply to their supporters , third - party groups and well - heeled super pacs			0
@entity9 condemned the @entity4 ad proposal pitched to billionaire @entity75 and his conservative super pac			2
likewise , senior @entity5 campaign adviser @entity77 reiterated to @entity78 on @entity1 's " @entity79 " sunday that critiques of @entity9 's @entity18 are " not fair game			1
" the success or failure of the two campaigns ' attempts to remove these topics from the table could speak volumes this fall on how far the nation has come on divisive race and religion - based debates in the political sphere , political experts say			0
opinion : why @entity5 vs. @entity9 is becoming a dogfight it wo n't be easy			1
outside groups , such as the conservative website " the @entity99 , " have criticized @entity5 for eating dog meat as a child growing up in @entity102			2
@entity61 @entity103 secretary of state @entity104 is demanding @entity107 officials authenticate @entity5 's @entity35 birth certificate , or he may remove the president from the ballot			1
@entity112 gov. @entity111 , a @entity113 , recently questioned whether female voters could back @entity9 , because his father was " born on a polygamy commune in @entity117			2
" according to a recent @entity119 poll , @entity57 were far more likely than @entity61 -- 27 % to 18 % -- to vote against a @entity40 candidate			0
some democrats struggle to contend with @entity5 's race			1
vice president @entity123 was recently dispatched to @entity57 stronghold @entity124 in the important swing state of @entity126 , in part because @entity5 barely eked out a win over @entity129 in the predominately white , working - class community			2
some republicans wrestle with @entity9 's religion			1
during the primary and caucus season , several social conservative and religious leaders secretly met in @entity137 to find and support any other @entity61 candidate besides @entity9 , citing his faith as a major issue			1
" there will be a number of @entity61 evangelicals who stay home because of @entity9 's @entity18 , " said @entity141 , a government professor at @entity142			1
hundreds of evangelical alumni and students at @entity13 , an institution founded by rev. @entity149 , balked on @entity150 when the school invited @entity9 to speak at commencement			2
rev. @entity155 in @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity158 , prominent @entity154 supporters , made derogatory comments about the @entity40 faith			0
the claim is that @entity5 is secretly a muslim , @entity48 said			0
the reason that it works is it signals through code his otherness , he said			0
" race is always there			0
" " @entity5 can never get out from under his racial difference			0
he has to position himself as not ' other '			0
race serves @entity9 because his whiteness reads him as insider			1
but on religion , he has to tell a story about how his @entity18 is an @entity35 religion and coincides with his conservative base			0
" on both fronts , @entity5 and @entity9 are still trying to find their footing			1
@entity5 has faltered a bit in the past while navigating the thorny issue of race			2
he made what was seen as a historic speech on race in march 2008 in the aftermath of the @entity4 controversy			0
however , @entity5 's remarks in 2009 that a white @entity193 , @entity194 , police officer acted " stupidly " in arresting @entity195 , a black @entity196 professor , and his administration 's hasty firing of @entity199 in , a black former @entity201 official , after her comments about a white farmer were taken out of context in 2010 , were seen as missteps			2
@entity5 's delayed response after unarmed black teen @entity204 was shot indicated the president and his advisers were " gauging the cultural landscape , " said @entity208 , an african - american studies professor at @entity209 and the author of several books , including " new black man : rethinking @entity213			2
" for his part , @entity9 in previous campaigns has weathered insults about his religion			0
in a february interview with conservative @entity220 host @entity219 , @entity9 criticized comments that he saw as @entity5 saying " we must be a less @entity17 nation			1
" and @entity9 , through appearances with his wife and family , is carefully honing a narrative that seeks to make him seem more like the rest of the nation , @entity48 said			0
" the fact that the leading @entity61 candidate is a @entity40 has changed the dialogue , " @entity48 said .			0

both @entity9 and @entity5 have suffered attacks because of their faith
candidates painted by some as outside the mainstream , ' others '
" it 's the elephant in the room , " said one expert on race and politics
