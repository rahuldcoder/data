@entity0 , @entity1 -- there is at present a profound uncertainty about currencies			1
that is why the president of the @entity8 , @entity7 , created such a stir with a brief reference to an enhanced role for gold in the course of a plea for a more sustainable international exchange rate system			1
the revival of interest in a golden measure of value derives from two fundamental sources			0
first , there is a question about our personal sense of worth			0
the aftermath of the economic crisis has destroyed our confidence in the reliability of conventional paper money			0
we need money as a store of value , but in the course of the crisis it has also become a tool of government policy			0
@entity37 monetary policy or " quantitative easing " can help to get the economy moving again			1
but the purposes of money may conflict and collide			0
when money becomes too much of a policy tool , the function of reliably measuring value gets chipped away			0
we look at gold when we are really upset about big price changes			1
over the past two years , market sentiment has shifted abruptly from fear of deflation to fear of inflation			1
the crisis has produced a profound shock , in which some prices ( especially housing ) have moved sharply lower while others ( notably foodstuffs and some raw materials ) have increased			1
the movement of prices is actually an important part of the adjustment process : that is , @entity64 should devote less of their resources to building and filling mega-size houses			1
but the price changes involved are deeply discomforting : the prices that are falling represent a major store of wealth , because people viewed their house as a sort of source of cash ; and the prices that are rising are a major part of daily expenditure			1
more opinion on topics in the news the appeal of gold would be that it might be a better way of storing value			1
but it would not avoid the harsh task of adjustment at a personal level			0
secondly , there is an international dimension to the concern with gold			1
the crisis has intensified international conflict			0
it has pushed countries to compete much more aggressively for markets , and to worry that other countries are using unfair means to push their exports			0
@entity64 think that @entity101 has maintained an artificially undervalued exchange rate , while @entity104 countries accuse @entity105 of having devised the @entity106 as a monetary unit that gives @entity105 permanent cost advantages			1
even former @entity110 chair @entity109 now says that @entity64 monetary policy is aimed at the weakening of the dollar			2
as a consequence , the victims start to retaliate			0
both the rhetoric and the consequences in terms of exchange rate actions seem to recall the currency wars of the 1930s , when the world spiraled down into protectionism			0
can the countries of the world sit down at a table and hammer out an agreement on what exchange rates can be ? no previous attempt at such an exercise has been successful			0
the exchange rates adopted at @entity133 in 1944 needed to be extensively modified in the late 1940s , and the @entity135 conference of 1971 , which tried to work out a new system , broke down within a year and a half as countries ignored any need for monetary constraint			2
the appeal of gold is that it sets a clear limit on the extent to which policy actions can manipulate exchange rates			2
but for nations and individuals , it does not in any way remove the pain from living in altered circumstances			0
the gold standard worked reasonably well in the 19th century , but even then it did not produce complete price stability			2
in the absence of new sources of gold , it exerted a downward influence on prices ; then , in the 1890s , new gold started to flow from @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 , and the result was mild inflation			1
a real effort at the monetization of gold today would produce a much more dramatic version of the same sort of logic			2
first , there would be a major scramble for gold and the current gold bubble would swell to even greater proportions			2
that would provide very large incentives to existing producers of gold in @entity163 and @entity183 to intensify extraction , but also to others to look for nonconventional sources , such as the bulk processing of seawater to extract the very small gold content			2
the result would be an initial deflation and then a colossal inflation that would make the 19th century experience look trivial			1
the late - 19th century critics who thought that there must be a better way of storing value than gold were right			2
but such a search demands sustained attention to methods of limiting the tendency of both individuals and governments to behave in a way that produces short - term gains while sacrificing the longer term good of stability			0
self - limitation , rather than the magic fix of a new precious metal - based currency , should be the real golden rule			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

people are profoundly uncertain about currencies , says @entity215
he says sharp drops in housing prices and increases in commodities are causing fear
@entity215 : gold appeals to people because it limits governments ' monetary policies
basing currencies on gold would result in deflation , then colossal inflation , says @entity215
