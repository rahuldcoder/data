bearing the loss of a child is unimaginable to most			2
what 's even more unimaginable for the @entity3 of @entity4 , @entity5 , is how their 17 - year - old son died : by suffocating after falling headfirst into a rolled - up gym mat at his high school on january 11			1
you know i sent my child to school for an education and he did go to school one way and came back dead , " his mother , @entity17 said			1
how could @entity19 , a three - sport athlete , fall into an upright mat while reaching for his shoe and not get out , as investigators said ? it was an accident , police said , as there were no bruises on the body and no signs of foul play			1
but the bizarre circumstances did n't sit right with the family , even though they 're not sure what happened to their son			2
the teen 's parents , @entity37 and @entity17 , allege the local sheriff department did not follow protocol on the case , moving the body and mishandling evidence			1
they also believe the sheriff was too quick to make a judgment call on what happened			2
within 24 hours of finding the body , @entity47 sheriff @entity46 announced that investigators had no reason to believe there was foul play			2
@entity47 coroner @entity53 agrees with the family , saying that the body had been moved before he arrived			2
he also told @entity56 he was not contacted until six hours after the body was found , although @entity5 law states the coroner should be notified immediately			1
the final autopsy report , released just last week , stated that the teen died of accidental suffocation ; it 's what the preliminary autopsy from january 14 said , too			1
taking to the streets the @entity65 buried their boy in january , but they were still waiting for answers			1
after months of waiting for the final autopsy report , the family started speaking up			1
they 've taken to the streets , organizing rallies for justice			2
chants booming over a megaphone have become a daily scene since april in this south @entity5 city of about 56,000			1
" no justice ! no peace ! " protesters shout			2
" i do n't feel that there was any investigation until there was protesting and all this attention coming to them , " @entity80 said			0
" that 's when they started to act like they were doing an investigation			0
" despite the family 's persistent protests and claims that protocol was broken , lt. @entity90 of the @entity91 maintains investigators were " actively working " on the case from the time @entity19 's body was found on january 11 until the final autopsy was released on may 2			1
after taking testimony and looking at the physical and forensic evidence , @entity90 said an accident was the only scenario that fit			0
more than 100 people , including students , teachers and parents , were interviewed , he added			1
@entity108 , the attorney for the @entity65 , has alleged that if @entity19 had been white , the investigation would have gone differently			1
but @entity90 said the case was handled as professionally as in any case			0
" race never played into it , " he said			0
" the victim played into it			0
that 's who we 're working for is the victim and the victim 's family			0
" @entity19 's aunt @entity122 has been alongside her family at many of the protests			1
her son and her nephew were close and played basketball and football together at @entity130			0
" we are just hoping that the truth will come out			0
it 's hard not sleeping at night not knowing , " @entity122 said			0
like @entity19 's parents , she believes he was beaten to death , referring to a gruesome postmortem photo of @entity19 shown on protest posters			1
" the perp is still out there and we do n't know if it 's a person at the school			0
" the family is n't rallying alone -- hundreds have joined the movement , from friends to @entity4 residents who barely knew or never met @entity19			1
local businessman and @entity147 @entity148 -- no relation to the family -- is a concerned community member who has been protesting			1
he has known @entity19 's mother for several years and met the teen once or twice , he said			1
" it 's emotional because it 's my community , " he said			2
" even though a tragedy happened , to see that many people come out and support someone in the community , it made me proud to be from here			2
" watch videos from a recent rally for @entity19 complete strangers are rallying alongside the @entity3 , too			1
@entity163 first heard about @entity19 through her involvement with the @entity166 chapter of the @entity167			1
the 53 - year - old drove down to @entity4 from @entity169 to rally alongside family and community members on april 18 and again on may 4			2
@entity163 did not know @entity17 , but decided to join the rally because he reminded her of her own grandsons			0
" i am a grandmother of two boys whom i want to have the right and opportunity to live , grow up , travel and go to school anywhere they please without fear or intimidation , or death by cloudy statements , " she said			2
while the rallies have been peaceful , seven people , including @entity19 's parents , @entity122 and several other aunts , were arrested for obstruction at a rally on april 25 , according to the @entity47 sheriff 's office			1
the group was blocking people from entering or leaving the @entity194			0
the rally cries have spread far outside @entity4			0
thanks to a @entity199 tribute page and stories sent to @entity201 , the @entity19 story started to spread online			1
@entity122 , @entity17 's aunt , sent in an @entity201 that has been viewed more than 100,000 times and been shared 8,000 times on @entity199			0
@entity122 described @entity19 as a sweet , quiet teen who had dreams of becoming a professional athlete			1
" he was determined to do his best and be his best , " she told @entity56			0
waiting for resolution @entity19 's father has been the more vocal member of the family , at least publicly			1
his wife , @entity17 , speaks in quiet , short sentences			0
her eyes still express shock			0
@entity37 did n't let his wife go into the morgue to identify their son			0
authorities told the family that blood had rushed to @entity19 's head and upper body , his father said			1
a photo of @entity19 's bloated , postmortem face was almost unrecognizable			1
you do n't expect to see your child lying down like that , " said @entity37 , recalling seeing his son 's body			0
" as handsome as my son was , the day you see him like that is crazy			0
" even though the case is officially closed , the @entity237 told @entity56 they will keep protesting			0
they 're still looking for a resolution			0
" no matter who you are , how much money your parents have , the color of your skin , everyone deserves justice			2
everyone , " said @entity80			0
while he does n't believe the official reports of how his son died , @entity37 knows he 's not alone			2
he hopes the attention from outside @entity47 , including the large online community invested in the story , will keep the issue alive			1
" it means that people are not going to fall for anything			0
you know from the way they said the thing happened , people are not buying it			0
