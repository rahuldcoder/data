-- the other day , the industry group representing small brewers issued its latest definition of what qualifies as a " craft " beer			1
based on our size , that definition excluded us , even though we brew some of the most popular craft beers in the marketplace			1
we respect the fact that some of our fellow brewers would want to differentiate themselves , but we 're convinced that the ultimate assessment of our beers will not come from an industry organization , but instead from @entity19 's beer drinkers			1
we know that no matter what style of beer it is , we will ultimately be judged by the quality of our beers			1
we like that , because we are confident that the quality of our beers stacks up well versus that of any brewer of any size , anywhere			1
now , because we are best known for brewing some of @entity19 's biggest light beers , some people may be skeptical about that claim			2
we urge those people not to confuse the style of a beer with the quality of the beer			2
whether it 's a light lager designed to provide the refreshment many @entity19 beer drinkers seek , or a vigorously hopped @entity39 designed to provide the nice bite many other beer drinkers desire , our brewmasters are obsessed with crafting superior - quality beers within each style			1
while we may be big , we are still a company of beer people who take great pride in our beer culture and heritage , tracing our roots to two visionary immigrant entrepreneurs who opened breweries in the mid- 19th century , @entity53 and @entity54			0
we 're also proud of our craft heritage			0
nearly a quarter century ago , we acquired the @entity56 , which was making great beers , but struggling financially like many smaller brewers of that era			1
@entity60 's , as it 's affectionately known , was founded in 1867 , and we promised we were n't presumptuous enough to tell it how to brew its beers			0
we 've kept that promise , and the @entity66 family -- now on its sixth generation in the business -- is experimenting more than ever with new styles and flavors , including the popular lemonade - flavored @entity71			0
launched in 1995 by brewmaster @entity74 , @entity73 exposed @entity19 beer drinkers to @entity77 - style ales at a time when they were not widely known			0
after a quiet start , @entity73 has gone on to become the best - selling craft beer in the country			0
in fact , @entity73 introduces many consumers to craft , opening their eyes to the diversity of beer			0
the brewers of @entity89 's , @entity73 and other smaller craft and import beers operate autonomously so they can maintain their own unique personalities and keep experimenting and pushing limits			1
as a large brewer , we do not view the emergence of craft beer as a threat , because we know that innovation is essential to the @entity19 beer industry			1
in fact , we appreciate the vital role craft beers play within our industry			0
and we believe it 's good for beer that there are more breweries and more brands available to @entity19 beer drinkers than at any other time in @entity19 history			2
we 're determined to continue to play a leading role in that innovation			0
and whatever style beer you might prefer , all we ask is that you judge us by the quality of the beer in the glass			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .			2
