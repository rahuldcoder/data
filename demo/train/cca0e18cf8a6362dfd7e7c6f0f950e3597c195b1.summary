-- @entity1 is a big , end - of - bench bruiser who can harangue opposing centers			1
only one of those things matters -- at least publicly -- to @entity8 teams that might be considering his services for the 2013 - 14 season after his highly publicized coming out on monday			2
" he 's a weird player in a sense , " said @entity11 , who covers the @entity12 , @entity1 ' latest career stop , for the @entity14			1
" he 's nothing spectacular , never stood out , but he 's still an effective player in terms of what he does			2
" that @entity21 © @entity20 © includes physical defense and an ability to bang in the paint with imposing big men like @entity26 and @entity27 , as well as a willingness to dish out all six of his fouls , @entity11 said			0
it includes a strong basketball iq , a team mentality and a few other intangibles , such as the ability to set screens			0
" i 've had players tell me , ' when he comes to set a screen , you 're going to get open , ' " @entity11 said			0
opinion : here 's to @entity1 -- and the @entity8 what it does not include is the ability to fill up a stat sheet			1
over 12 seasons , he has a career average of 3.6 points per game , and he has n't averaged more than 2 points a games since his 2006 - 07 season as a @entity54			1
many 7 - footers who fill the lane are known for their blocking or rebounding ability , but despite being taken in the first round of the 2001 draft , out of @entity62 , @entity1 has never averaged more than 6.1 rebounds a game ( during the 2004 - 05 season at that ) , and he 's never been a prodigious shot blocker			1
there 's been much talk about what it means for basketball and the @entity74 community if he 's not signed after coming out , but @entity11 said he feels that teams will be more concerned with his 35th birthday coming in december and that he appeared in only six games , averaging 10 minutes per outing , for the @entity12			2
he 'll also command almost $ 1.4 million , the @entity8 minimum salary for a player with 10 or more years in the league			1
" that will go against him more than sexual orientation , " @entity11 said			0
@entity86 gave @entity1 advice on coming out that 's not to say that there is n't a place for him in the @entity8			1
even if he is n't picked up ahead of next season , a team may seek his services as injuries pile up and the february trade deadline nears			0
@entity98 , an @entity99 - based attorney and @entity101 contract negotiator who has represented @entity8 players in off - the - court matters , likens @entity1 to @entity105 or @entity106 , a fraternity of " bigger post guys who do n't rely on their quicks or perimeter play to survive			1
" sure , @entity105 and @entity26 had more impressive career stats , but as they 've grown older -- @entity105 is 39 , @entity26 40 -- they 've settled into more utilitarian roles , coming off the bench for a few minutes a game			1
while most of the reaction to @entity1 ' announcement has been positive , @entity98 said it 's possible his sexual orientation could affect his future , especially if an @entity8 general manager feels his team is too immature to handle the addition of the league 's first openly gay player			1
" that @entity129 , without divulging publicly that he had considered it , may go in a different direction , " @entity98 said			0
@entity1 needs to go to a team with solid structure and an assertive coach and @entity129 , @entity11 said			2
a cast of veterans will also help , as older players are more likely to be focused on winning than on whining about a teammate being gay			0
" it 'll probably have to be a veteran team that just needs a piece at the end of its bench , " @entity11 said			0
while it 's unclear , despite the myriad messages of support , what will happen if and when @entity1 next steps into a locker room , @entity11 said @entity1 has garnered a lot of good will , credibility and respect during his dozen years in the league			1
he 's a leader , and his teammates have always liked him , he said			0
on the flip side of that equation , @entity11 and @entity98 do n't foresee a team picking up @entity1 because he 's gay , as that would immediately devalue him among his teammates			1
@entity161 : but can the dude play ? " i do n't think people were tuning in to see @entity1 play , " @entity98 said			1
" they may never see him play anyway			0
he 's probably not going to get a ton of minutes			0
" for the moment , though , @entity1 is the subject of intense attention that has nothing to do with his basketball prowess			2
" he 's in the process of taking ownership over the here and now , which is actually coming out , " @entity171 , a @entity62 grad and former @entity173 player who dated @entity1 for eight years , told @entity0 's @entity174 on tuesday night			1
" and that can be very , i assume , overwhelming			0
" @entity179 says it will be a process , much like it was for her after @entity1 called off their 2009 engagement and upon learning -- in calls he made to her starting this past weekend -- that her longtime love , with whom she 'd planned a marriage and a family , was gay			1
" i hope ( it ) is a natural progression for him , " @entity171 said , as he becomes more comfortable with himself			0
i think time will allow more perspective on it as well			0
" @entity1 newfound stature in the gay rights movement , and the public eye , may open the door to some opportunities , such as off - the - court lessons on inclusiveness , @entity98 said			1
@entity205 slams the @entity1 hate machine but he did n't see how that would translate into additional revenue			2
@entity12 spokesman @entity209 said that while every jersey the club sold monday had @entity1 ' name on it , " it was not a large amount			2
" " i think it would be a terrible move to try to sign him for financial gain or rating , " @entity11 said			0
" he has too much respect for himself to be used for something other than what he is , which is a basketball player			0
" at least one @entity8 executive , @entity225 president and coo @entity226 , who in 2011 became the first openly gay @entity228 sports executive , said he does n't think @entity1 ' announcement will have any effect on him being signed for the 2013 - 14 season			1
" i think whatever percentage chance @entity1 had of being on an @entity8 roster when he woke up yesterday is probably identical this morning , " he said			2
" actually , i 'll take that back			0
... if he was 7 feet tall yesterday morning , my guess is with the weight that was lifted off his shoulders yesterday , he is probably 7 ' 2 " , so that might improve his chances			0
" @entity243 ' could n't be prouder ' of @entity1			2

new : " taking ownership over the here and now " is @entity1 ' *current* focus , *ex-fiancee* says
despite age and ho - *hum* career stats , @entity1 ' defense , intangibles could draw interest
*reporter* , contract specialist : if teams do n't sign him because he 's gay , it wo n't be made public
lack of playing time , $ 1.4 million minimum salary could work against 7 - foot , 12 - year veteran
