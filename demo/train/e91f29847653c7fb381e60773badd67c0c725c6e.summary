-- it 's a safe bet that whoever wins the presidential election will face fateful decisions on foreign policy in 2013			1
in a series of forums sponsored by three @entity10 - based foundations and livestreamed by @entity11 this year , experts have explored the issues that are likely to face the next administration			1
on wednesday , another session will feature a debate between representatives of the @entity18 and @entity19 campaigns -- @entity20 , representing @entity19 , will debate @entity21 , an adviser to the @entity18 campaign			1
it will be streamed live on @entity11 at 9 p.m. et. here 's a summary of several recent opinion pieces on foreign policy			1
@entity27 : @entity28 has made the world freer , safer , and wealthier international order is not an evolution ; it is an imposition			1
it is the domination of one vision over others -- in @entity28 's case , the domination of liberal free market principles of economics , democratic principles of politics , and a peaceful international system that supports these , over other visions that other nations and peoples may have			2
the present order will last only as long as those who favor it and benefit from it retain the will and capacity to defend it			0
if and when @entity28 power declines , the institutions and norms @entity28 power has supported will decline , too			2
or they may collapse altogether as we transition into another kind of world order , or into disorder			0
we may discover then that the @entity28 was essential to keeping the present world order together and that the alternative to @entity28 power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe -- which was what the world looked like right before the @entity28 order came into being			1
@entity27 is a senior fellow in @entity68 at @entity69			0
his most recent book is " @entity71 made			0
" @entity72 : @entity73 , show political courage on defense cuts after more than a decade of deficit spending , mounting national debt and the global financial crisis , we must shore up the @entity28 economy as the foundation of our prosperity and security			2
this will require hard choices to bring government spending and revenues into balance while still investing in the long - term drivers of @entity28 economic competitiveness			1
republicans and @entity92 have been unable to reach consensus on how to make these hard choices , bringing @entity73 to a standstill			0
the super-committee 's failure to reach agreement on deficit reduction highlighted another more worrisome deficit -- one of political courage , vision and classic @entity28 pragmatism			2
these qualities are sorely needed at a time when partisan ideological discipline seems to have trumped the other nobler forms of discipline that have made this country great			0
in this context , @entity28 must decide what kind of military we need for the future			2
@entity72 served as undersecretary of defense for policy in the @entity18 administration and is co-chair of the @entity18 campaign 's national security advisory committee			1
@entity123 : ten big questions for @entity18 , @entity19 on @entity125 @entity18 's rebalancing of priorities toward @entity125 is designed to reassure allies and new partners , without overly provoking a @entity130 vital to the global economy			1
for all its importance , however , the national political campaign has barely acknowledged the existence of @entity125 security			2
@entity130 has come under fire for currency manipulation and trading practices , and @entity140 's @entity139 managed to break into the campaign with his reckless missile launch			2
but the deeper , underlying issues of @entity125 security and their implications for the @entity28 are awaiting more deliberate consideration			1
... @entity18 and @entity19 administration policies for the @entity148 would be apt to overlap more than they would differ			1
but when it comes to making hard choices and implementing policies , leaders matter			0
and here it is worth noting that president @entity18 's @entity125 team in a second term would probably lack its most able senior official : secretary of state @entity158 , who has made her preference for returning to private life abundantly clear			1
@entity161 is senior adviser and senior director of the @entity163 at the @entity164 , a nonpartisan research organization in @entity10			0
@entity165 : what if @entity28 stops policing the world ? @entity18 's assertion that his recalibration of @entity28 foreign policy -- centered on withdrawing @entity28 troops from @entity172 wars and leaning more on allies and the @entity174 -- has awakened " a new confidence in our leadership " is without foundation			1
like @entity180 in the 19th century , @entity28 since the turn of the 20th century has been the world 's pivotal global power			1
fair or not , in moments when @entity28 seemed unsure of its role in the world , the world noticed and reacted			2
there is no reason to believe now is different			0
indeed , in many ways , looming opportunists are more obvious today than the 1930s , 1970s and 1990s			0
these include @entity193 and other @entity195 movements spinning @entity28 troop withdrawals from @entity197 and @entity198 as strategic defeats ; an emboldened @entity200 on the cusp of attaining nuclear weapons ; and a rising @entity130 flexing its muscles in the @entity204			1
to his credit , @entity19 has strongly warned against a world with more limited @entity28 leadership			1
he has also promised to reverse @entity18 's defense cuts and offer his own increases			2
but while @entity18 's approach may be shortsighted , @entity19 's would face an uphill battle against fiscal and popular sentiment			1
... whoever wins in november will confront not just an increasingly dangerous world , but also an increasingly isolationist public			1
the great challenge will be to convince the @entity28 people that robust @entity28 leadership in the world remains vital to their security and prosperity and convince the world it remains unwavering			2
history shows that doing otherwise only raises the stakes down the line			0
@entity165 teaches @entity28 foreign policy and international security at @entity228 's @entity227 , where he is also an affiliate of the @entity230			1
he worked as a foreign policy adviser and speechwriter to two senior @entity92 senators and has worked on presidential campaigns for both @entity92 and @entity236 candidates			1
@entity237 and @entity238 : drones are @entity18 's weapon of choice covert drone strikes are one of president @entity18 's key national security policies			1
he has already authorized 283 strikes in @entity245 , six times more than the number during president @entity247 's eight years in office			0
as a result , the number of estimated deaths from the @entity18 administration 's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the @entity247 administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618			0
under @entity18 , the drone campaign , which during the @entity247 administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of @entity193 , has undergone a quiet and unheralded shift to focus increasingly on killing @entity262 foot soldiers			2
... the number of drone strikes in 2011 fell by 40 % from the record number of strikes in 2010			0
so far this year , the number of strikes has dropped by a further 25 %			0
this is a welcome development			0
if the price of the drone campaign that increasingly kills only low - level @entity262 is alienating 180 million @entity245 -- that is too high a price to pay			0
while the drone campaign in @entity245 may be on the wane , it is amping up against the @entity193 affiliate in @entity277			0
this year alone , @entity18 has authorized around 30 drone strikes in @entity277 , while @entity247 only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office			0
@entity237 , @entity0 's national security analyst , is a director at the @entity283 , a @entity10 - based think tank that seeks innovative solutions across the ideological spectrum			0
@entity238 is a @entity286 scholar studying for an @entity287 at @entity288 , @entity289			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0
