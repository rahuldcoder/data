one thing makes @entity3 photographer @entity2 's work stand out from a world of wildlife photography -- a unique point of view			1
african elephants tower over you , lions stare balefully into your eyes , tigers look up from the water and rhinoceros charge straight at you			2
it can be a bit unsettling -- this feeling of feeling a little close to the animal			2
the unusual angles are the result of hours of research and elaborate planning , as well as countless trial and error in the field			1
@entity2 's new book , " encounter , " gathers 87 of his most stunning images , taken in some of the most remote parts of the world , in the dreariest of seasons , in the most dramatic light			1
we spoke with the photographer at a recent exhibit in @entity36 -- where his larger images were selling for more than $ 15,000 -- where he 'd come just after a show at the @entity41 in @entity42			1
@entity43 : what 's been your most gratifying experience in the field ? @entity2 : with these animals you 've got to photograph them in a way that they have n't been seen , or else the shot comes out boring			1
the shark photo was the result of 30 hours of waiting on a boat deck in @entity56			1
it 's impossible to know when the shark will come out of the water , so you have to focus on the baby seals and hope a shark is eying it too			1
more : 9 not - in - the - guidebook @entity66 safari tips sharks only predate out of the water if the waters are calm and they 'll only do it in the first hour after sunrise , and this only happens off @entity56 in july			1
the first few days i went out , there was nothing			0
but the belief that you 'll ( get the shot ) , to never give up , is important			0
@entity43 : there 's a shot of a lioness we ca n't stop looking at			2
@entity2 : i worked for a long time for the shot of the lioness			1
we scented the camera casing in @entity87 and she came straight up to the camera			0
perhaps my most important work in this exhibition is the photograph of the rhinoceros			2
rhinoceros have these amazing jawlines that you do n't usually get to see because they are not photographed from angles where you can see them			0
for this photo i set up the camera in the watering hole , to get this unusual angle , and got this shot at night at 10 p.m. after days of failure			2
@entity43 : how about frightening encounters ? @entity2 : the only moment of terror i 've had was when i met a bear in @entity109			1
you really are n't supposed to be on your own , but i was , and it was a big grizzly that had just come back from eating salmon			0
thank goodness it was n't hungry			0
you 're told what to do when you meet a bear -- you 're not supposed to run away , you 're supposed to talk to them			0
my heard was pounding so hard and it was difficult to get anything to come out of my mouth but then i started talking			0
" hello mr. @entity122 , how are you			0
" and then it just looked at me and walked away			0
@entity43 : what 's your favorite time of year to take pictures ? @entity2 : it depends on what i am photographing			1
for @entity66 , i like to go in october			1
it 's the end of the dry season and you get these big thunderclouds for a backdrop			2
you do n't want blue skies when you are photographing -- blue skies are boring -- and you ca n't get these dramatic shots of light with blue skies			0
more : 7 things every first - time @entity66 traveler should know i like to go to the @entity143 in may and june , when it 's less cold			1
not that it 's not cold -- i still got frostbite -- but it 's better than other months			2
and then i like to go to @entity148 in january			0
i go shoot the snow monkeys			0
@entity43 : which cameras do you use ? @entity2 : nikons -- @entity153 and @entity154			1
@entity43 : do you travel alone or with people ? @entity2 : i go alone			1
people usually do n't want to go when and where i 'm going			0
i want to go when it 's raining , and where no one 's around ! @entity43 : how long does it usually take to get the photograph you want ? @entity2 : you ca n't just show up on sunday and expect to leave on monday			1
after you do all the research , get to know the animals ' habits , then if you turn up on sunday and get a good picture by thursday that 's a good job			2
@entity43 : where do you recommend for safaris ? the prices tell you everything			0
i like @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178			0
i would n't recommend @entity66			1
for photographing , i do n't like to go to the parks where they do n't let you get out of the car			0
you ca n't get the good angles if you stay in the car			0
