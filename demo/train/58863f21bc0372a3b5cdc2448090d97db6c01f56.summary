the reputations of one of the @entity3 's finest generals and of a once - admired institution may get tarnished , but nothing should now get in the way of urgent investigations , firings and immediate fixes in health care for veterans			1
and for good measure , maybe heads should roll at the @entity14 , too , because what we have been told so far about a burgeoning scandal over veterans ' care does n't add up			1
the story line out of the administration is that the head of @entity23 , retired gen. @entity24 , and president @entity25 are both " mad as hell " about alleged misdeeds and have sprung into action to put things aright			1
we are led to believe that alarm bells went off in both organizations as soon as allegations surfaced			0
one would so like to believe that were the case			0
@entity24 has a sterling record as a soldier			1
he was twice wounded in @entity38 -- the second time grievously , losing most of one foot			0
a lesser man would have been forced out of the service but through sheer courage ( he used to run punishing laps around a track to show he was still able ) , he convinced the @entity3 to let him stay and he rose to four stars			0
more recently , @entity24 was the man who had the guts to tell the truth before we went into @entity48 -- insisting he needed a much bigger force -- and was essentially cashiered			1
i have long been an unabashed admirer			0
@entity25 has also taken up the cause of veterans since he first ran for the @entity53			1
@entity54 has the first lady			0
and under this president , much good has been accomplished for veterans in terms of health care , reducing homelessness , jobs , and importantly , a nation 's respect			1
but as admirable as @entity24 's and @entity25 's records have been on behalf of veterans , the story line the administration has been peddling about the @entity68 's care of veterans simply does n't fit the facts			1
the underlying problem at the heart of this scandal -- excessive , long waits for medical care for veterans coming home from @entity48 and @entity76 -- has persisted for years			1
running for the @entity14 , candidate @entity25 promised action			1
soon after he took over the @entity68 , @entity24 did take action , ordering that henceforth veterans would not have to wait more than 14 days for a medical appointment			1
but the bureaucracy at the @entity68 , second only to the @entity80 in size , is notoriously sluggish			2
in 2010 -- four years ago ! -- the deputy undersecretary of the @entity68 wrote a nine - page memo saying that in order to cover up their continued delays , various parts of the va system were engaged in " gaming strategies " -- in effect , lying			1
the @entity92 and @entity68 inspector generals wrote reports saying the practice was widespread			1
one would have thought that would have set off alarm bells at both the @entity68 and the @entity14			2
where was the anger then ? there were some internal investigations , but they never went anywhere and there was little apparent sense of urgency			0
six months ago , @entity106 turned loose its own investigative reporters and aired stories about excessive waits in several facilities across the country			2
again , the @entity68 and the @entity14 had little to say			2
then a month ago , @entity106 ( along with the @entity112 ) broke the story from the @entity68 that managers there have allegedly been cooking their books to provide false assurances			1
veterans awaiting care were dying			2
the administration seemed to brush the story aside and @entity24 refused repeated requests from @entity106 for an interview			2
recent days have been a political nightmare for the @entity68			2
hauled before @entity124 to testify , @entity24 testified that evidence suggested only " isolated incidents " in the system			2
that same day @entity106 was reporting that there were allegations of misdeeds in at least six centers across the country			0
the next day the @entity68 itself said there were 10 centers under investigation			0
by this week , the official number had mushroomed to 26			0
and weeks after the fact , the @entity68 has rescinded a bonus it gave earlier this year to the boss of that @entity142 operation			0
in the weeks ahead , the administration now says , investigators will come up with reports and maybe some folks will be forced out			0
in the meantime , veterans are still waiting to hear of decisive action to end their long delays in care			1
when troubles arise in which @entity155 are needlessly dying , citizens like to think of the president as the fireman - in - chief			0
he is there in the @entity14 , his team ever vigilant , and at the first sign of danger , he leads his team into action			0
at his side is the @entity167 officer with responsibility			0
sadly , that is not what happened here			0
for most @entity155 , the story of @entity68 officials allegedly falsifying records of veterans ' care is disgusting			1
those old enough to remember will be reminded how the government falsified counts of body bags in @entity38			0
but the real issue is whether as a country , we are keeping faith with our veterans -- whether , as @entity185 urged in his second inaugural , we are binding the wounds of those who fought			0
surely , we owe them prompt and professional care -- no more excuses , no more delays , no more b.s .			1

@entity194 : president @entity25 and @entity24 have done much for veterans
but he says their stories about the delays for medical care do n't add up
a top @entity68 official wrote about the coverup of long waiting lists four years ago
@entity194 : no more excuses , it 's time to investigate and fix this problem
