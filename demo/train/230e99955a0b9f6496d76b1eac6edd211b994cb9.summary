even at the age of 7 , @entity0 knew her world was crumbling			2
she avoided the benches with the sign : no dogs or @entity7 allowed			1
she could n't attend public schools			2
and the @entity9 and their growling @entity11 shepherds raided her family 's house , throwing their books into a fire			0
as a child , " we were very aware , " said @entity0 , now 84			0
jews were n't welcome in their own home			0
growing increasingly fearful , her parents and her older brother left their hometown of @entity22 , @entity11 , in 1938 and journeyed to an unlikely new home -- the @entity24			1
about 1,200 @entity25 fled to the @entity24 from 1937 to 1941 , escaping the throes of the @entity9 only to face another bloody war under @entity29 occupation			1
many of the @entity7 came from @entity31 and @entity11 , as the anti-semitic policies including the @entity34 race laws intensified			1
unable to immigrate to countries such as the @entity36 and the @entity37 , thousands of @entity7 escaped to places such as @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 in the @entity42 and @entity43			1
those who arrived in @entity43 did n't realize that they had escaped the @entity46 only to be caught in the war in the @entity48 , where the @entity24 came under attack			1
" we were going from the frying pan to the fire , " @entity0 said			0
" we went from @entity54 persecutors to the @entity29			1
" the @entity24 capital was liberated after a grueling , monthlong campaign in the @entity57 , one of the bloodiest battles of @entity60 , which now marks its 70th anniversary			1
this little known chapter of history about @entity7 refugees in the @entity24 has inspired two documentaries and talk of a possible movie			1
" we know about stories like @entity72 , ' @entity73 ' -- the things that grab popular imagination , " said @entity68 , whose father , @entity69 escaped to the @entity24 after @entity70 in 1938			1
" once you bring an @entity79 element , it becomes so complicated , interesting and surprising			1
" about 40 of the @entity24 refugees are alive today , according to documentary filmmakers			1
they were children when they arrived in the @entity24 over 70 years ago			1
" that was like a rebirth , " said @entity83 , the filmmaker of the documentary , " an open door : jewish rescue in the @entity24 , " in which he interviewed several @entity7 refugees			1
" they went from certain death to this life			0
" among them was @entity69 , who arrived in @entity43 at the age of eight			0
he recounted his experience in his biography , " escape to @entity43 : from @entity98 to @entity29 @entity99			1
" " my father got a lot of positive attention , coming from a place where @entity7 were exiled and treated so poorly , " said his daughter , of his escape from @entity102			1
" the @entity24 were incredibly kind and treated him extremely well			1
there was an element of something so redemptive			0
" @entity110 , the first president of the @entity112 , and a group of @entity37 that included future @entity37 president @entity114 and the @entity115 , the @entity7 - @entity37 brothers , became increasingly concerned about the treatment of @entity7 in @entity102 during the late 1930s			1
" they had a shared view of the world , they were men who understood what was happening in @entity102 , " said @entity118 , co-producer of the documentary " rescue in the @entity24			1
" that documentary was screened in the @entity24 with the country 's president , @entity126 in attendance last year			1
over poker , the men devised a strategy to bring @entity7 refugees to the @entity24			1
the @entity24 @entity112 remained under @entity37 supervision so it could not accept people who would need public assistance			1
the refuge committee sought highly skilled professionals such as doctors , mechanics and accountants			0
by 1938 , a stream of refugees arrived including a rabbi , doctors , chemists and even a conductor , @entity146 , who survived @entity148 concentration camp and later became the founder of the @entity150			2
@entity152 's ambitions to settle 10,000 @entity7 in the southern island of @entity154 were dashed as the the war arrived to the shores of the @entity24			1
for the @entity25 who arrived in the @entity24 , " it was a cultural shock , " said @entity0			1
" we did n't know the language			0
we had never seen any other than white people before			0
" the humidity was thick , the heat overpowering and the mosquitoes gigantic			0
but the young @entity7 refugees saw the @entity24 as a new adventure			1
children climbed mango trees , swam in the bay and learned @entity24 songs			2
@entity172 became friends with local neighbors , played sipa ( a local kicking game ) and relished tropical fruit such as papaya and guava			0
life in @entity43 was running around in sandals and summer clothes			0
the experience differed for her parents			0
" it was very difficult for my parents , " she said			0
" they never really learned @entity190			0
they had been westernized and they stayed mostly within their circle of other immigrants			0
" many of them lived in crowded community housing where fights would break out			0
they had gone from being wealthy in @entity11 to having nothing			0
" it was n't what they 'd known before in @entity11 , " @entity83 said			0
" at the same time , " they were able to practice their religion , able to intermingle and have businesses			0
" @entity172 's idyllic days of playing under the @entity43 sun came to an abrupt end as the war came ashore to the @entity24			1
starting in 1941 , the @entity29 occupied the @entity24			1
in some respects , the @entity7 refugees were treated considerably better than @entity24			1
what ironically protected the @entity7 was their @entity11 passports with the swastikas -- they were viewed as allies			2
" it occurred to me later , that 's what kept us from being interned , " said @entity216 , who was 7 years old at the time			0
the @entity29 interned @entity36 and @entity37 residents in camps			2
@entity24 and @entity37 soldiers were forced to march 65 miles in the infamous @entity225 in which an estimated 10,000 prisoners died			2
@entity29 officers confiscated residents ' homes and also hoarded crops for its military			2
the local economy shriveled and food became scarce			0
life under the @entity29 was hard and brutal , surviving refugees said			1
when @entity239 forces began taking back the @entity24 , bombs fell daily			2
families hid in bomb shelters , not knowing where the next one would fall			0
@entity69 spent days hiding in a ditch , shaking with a mattress covering his head			0
one of @entity172 's friends died after stepping on a mine			0
" fires were going on all the time , " said @entity0			0
" you could see the black clouds , smell of bodies , lying there and decaying			0
" as the @entity29 were losing @entity43 , the imperial troops launched a brutal urban campaign			2
rapes , torture , beheadings and bayoneting of civilians were widely reported , so much so that a @entity29 general @entity260 was later executed for having failed to control his troops			2
" the @entity29 decided to destroy @entity43			2
they were going to give them a dead city , they set about doing that , " said @entity216			0
" they burned , they killed			0
" but war time in the @entity24 was " preferable to being in a concentration camp , " she said			1
the monthlong urban street fighting for @entity43 left the capital in ashes , decimating its economy and infrastructure			0
the @entity24 suffered nearly a million civilian deaths during the war			1
despite the trauma of facing both fronts of the war , @entity172 remains grateful			2
" we would not be alive today if not for the @entity24			2
we would 've been destroyed in the crematorium			0
" in 2009 , a monument honoring the @entity24 was erected at the @entity285 in the @entity287 city of @entity288			2
the monument , shaped like three open doors , thanks the @entity24 people and its president for taking in @entity7 refugees during the @entity46			1
many of the descendants of the @entity7 refugees who fled to the @entity24 have not forgotten their family 's place of refuge			1
when @entity301 struck the @entity24 in november 2013 , the disaster brought in relief workers from the @entity303			2
@entity304 , who is related to @entity172 and is the son of a @entity7 refugee to the @entity24 , headed its assessment team			1
" for me it was like coming full circle and i could n't help but think of what it must have been like when my grandparents and mother arrived 76 years ago , " he said			0
" my going to the @entity24 after @entity301 was very special			2
i was repaying a debt to the country that saved my family			0

@entity24 welcomed @entity7 refugees during @entity46 while other countries closed doors
about 1,200 @entity25 moved there before 1941
while they escaped the @entity46 , they were confronted with the @entity79 front of the war as @entity29 *invaded*
