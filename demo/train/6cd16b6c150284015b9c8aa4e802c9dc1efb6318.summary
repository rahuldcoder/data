@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was raped in march on the nighttime streets of @entity1 's capital , but she will not bring charges against the man she says did it since she may be the one who ends up in prison			1
the 25 - year - old says the legal advice she received was to not go to court , leaving her to suffer in silence			0
there is no law in @entity1 that defines rape			1
according to a local @entity20 - funded group working with the victims , the law criminalizes the women instead of their rapists -- and society ostracizes the women			1
@entity3 , who asked not to use her real name , said : " i am sure that if i raise my voice i 'm going to be criminalized by my society and i will pay the price harshly ... and as a result i may stay single for the rest of my life			0
" she added : " i consulted a lawyer secretly , and he advised me sincerely not to seek justice because that would throw me in jail			0
i know what happened to other girls who decided to go to court and face the community			0
their lives were destroyed completely forever			0
so i already know what would happen to me if i had to follow that path			0
" this @entity45 republic has no place for rape victims like me			1
" @entity1 laws are based on @entity50 law and the penal code forbids relationships between both sexes outside marriage			1
that includes a consensual relationship between a boyfriend and girlfriend but can also criminalize a woman who is forced to have sex			2
@entity61 , a law specialist and legal adviser to the government , said : " if raped women do n't bring strong evidence , which is not easy , they would be accused of @entity67 -- an @entity69 word meaning sex out of marriage -- and end up in jail			1
it 's because the victims of rape are always accused of a @entity67 which make a lot of problems			2
" @entity61 added : " the rape issue has been one of the many taboos that have n't been investigated ( by the government )			0
" @entity81 , which promotes health and equality issues , is working with local groups and the government to define rape in law and protect its victims			1
@entity88 , @entity81 assistant representative in @entity1 for its reproductive health program and population and development program , said he was not aware of any rape victim in the capital currently in jail but could not comment on what was happening outside the capital			2
even with legal protection , women victims of rape still face a social stigma that is hard to overcome			1
he said : " women are still afraid to complain if they are victims of rape because there is an attitude from the society			2
" @entity88 added : " there is no law to define rape but there will be one			2
and work is being done with police officers and judges ... to let them understand the problem is not the woman , but the perpetrator of the rape			2
" the @entity20 - funded @entity117 ( known by its @entity119 acronym @entity121 ) is at the forefront of trying to change both the law and society			0
when a woman reports a rape , police contact @entity121 and the woman is taken to the @entity129 center			0
@entity130 , a former midwife and president of the organization , set up the @entity134 center in 2001 to provide help for rape victims			1
mint @entity130 said : " there is no mention of the words ' rape , ' or ' sexual violence ' in the @entity1 laws which left a growing number of women as victims ... all the words that are related to sex are extremely taboo and can never be mentioned publicly			1
" mint @entity130 said there were 308 rape cases registered by her organization in 2008 and 205 in 2009 , but she noted that " what has been reported is only the tip of the iceberg			0
" she said they mainly deal with cases in the capital , @entity0 , but there remain many unreported rapes in the city and the country			0
she said rape victims bring shame to their families and the woman 's reputation , and few women have the courage to report the crime and be registered			1
mint @entity130 added : " we focus basically on the capital @entity0 , but we think of covering the interior regions as well			0
" mint @entity130 has tried in vain for a decade to get her message into the national media to assist rape victims			1
" i requested having a program in the state mass media -- radio and tv -- but my request was turned down			0
recently , the national tv hosted me for the first time on a program , but it was censored without giving any justification ... it 's a big problem here to defend rape victims , " she said			1
@entity121 is also working with government and religious leaders in a bid to get a new rape law			2
@entity191 , spokesman for the @entity192 , said the ministry has begun work on the issue to help end the ordeal of rape victims			1
" for the first time , the ministry is now in touch with @entity201 activists , lawyers and opinion makers with the purpose of studying the situation , first , and then trying to act			0
