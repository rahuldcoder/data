-- in @entity2 , all the talk is about " @entity3 "			1
in @entity5 , all the talk was about the " @entity6 "			0
tonight , after a performance which helped to write another chapter in one of the season 's most romantic fairy tales , @entity2 allowed itself to dream of its own special one -- @entity13 -- the first			1
@entity2 , for so long a club living in the shadow of city rival @entity17 , has the opportunity to make history not just at home but also on the @entity22 stage			1
a convincing 3 - 1 win over @entity24 at @entity25 secured a place in the @entity28 final and allowed the dream of a league and @entity22 double to prosper			1
this @entity2 team has guts , resilience and an indefatigable spirit -- but what it also has , in abundance , is quality			1
trailing to @entity40 ' strike , @entity2 offered a brutal riposte with @entity42 leveling before @entity43 and @entity44 applied the finishing touches			1
four points clear at the top of @entity13 with three games remaining and a clash with @entity17 to decide the destiny of the @entity28 trophy to come in @entity52 on may 24 , this is turning out to be some season for @entity2			1
" it 's a dream , " @entity2 midfielder @entity54 told @entity55			1
" we have a great spirit , we are a great team , we all work together , now we are in the final in @entity52 , the dreams can be true			0
" it is not easy to play here , we know that			0
but we knew @entity24 had to play more			1
" we know we are very good away from home			0
after our goal @entity24 went down a bit , but we were confident and now we are there			1
" we know @entity17 is a fantastic team with great players			1
they can win the game in any action but we are there			0
last year we won the @entity72 in their stadium so we are confident			0
" not since 1996 has @entity2 won the domestic title but managed by @entity76 , who was part of that team 18 years ago , it now stands on the brink of history			2
@entity76 , who presides over a budget nearly five times smaller than @entity17 , has worked wonders but perhaps even would not have expected his players to record such an impressive victory			2
to score three goals away from home in @entity22 competition is a marked achievement , but to do so against @entity24 , a team whose defense has been so miserly in the competition , is staggering			2
@entity24 , derided for its defensive tactics and considered an " enemy of football " by some because of its negative approach , has already answered its critics on numerous occasions this season			2
a fine victory at @entity101 on sunday proved once again that @entity103 's tactics , however unpalatable , gain results			0
but on this occasion , the solidity and cohesion which had caused such frustration in @entity2 last week , was missing			1
the dour goalless draw in the opening leg led to plenty of accusations that @entity24 had not attempted to win the game but simply stifle @entity2			1
there is no doubt that @entity103 has been hurt by the criticism and hit back at his detractors by claiming that " at this moment , football is full of philosophers			0
" while everybody appears to have an opinion on @entity24 's defensive approach , @entity103 sticks to the belief which has made him a serial winner -- winning at all costs			2
the prospect of facing his former employer , @entity17 , in the final added another subplot to an already intriguing tie			1
@entity131 , back from injury , was restored to the side , and @entity24 , often so adroit at scraping through tight contests , appeared confident			2
yet it was the visitors who began the brighter of the two			0
@entity2 , on the brink of the domestic title and chasing a place in the final for the first time in 40 years , played with a sense of purpose and came within inches of taking an early lead			1
@entity153 , influential throughout , aimed what looked like a cross towards goal only for the ball to sail over @entity24 goalkeeper @entity151 and smash against the crossbar			2
@entity24 responded with @entity155 's overhead kick sailing just wide of the far post as the home side stepped up the pressure			2
and with 11 minutes of the first half remaining , the home side finally made the breakthrough			0
@entity162 escaped his marker on the right before finding @entity165 , who in turn found @entity40 to fire home from inside the penalty area			0
@entity40 , who began his career at @entity2 and scored 84 goals in 214 games for the club before moving to @entity101 in 2007 , refused to celebrate but that gesture did not detract from the significance of the strike			2
buoyed by the goal , @entity24 began to take control and with its resilient defense holding @entity2 comfortably , the visitors appeared rattled			1
but with just a minute of the opening period remaining , the game was turned on its head			0
@entity54 , once of @entity24 , picked out @entity183 at the far post and when he crossed the ball into the penalty area , @entity42 was on hand to steer the ball home			1
@entity103 's defense , such an integral part of his side 's success , appeared brittle for the first time in the competition and it never really recovered			0
within minutes of the restart , @entity151 was forced to produce a fine save to deny @entity44 after the @entity2 midfielder had found space inside the penalty area			1
while @entity151 performed heroics at one end , @entity202 , on loan from @entity24 , did similar at the other			2
@entity206 's powerful header looked certain to find the net but @entity202 produced an astonishing stop to deny the @entity24 captain			2
that save appeared to change the momentum of the contest and slowly but surely , @entity2 began to turn the screw			0
with an hour of the game gone , @entity2 finally struck and grabbed the initiative			0
@entity43 , a man constantly linked with a move to @entity24 , was fouled inside the penalty area by @entity218			1
the @entity220 striker , who endured a nervous wait to take the spot kick after the ball failed to settle on the spot , fired home emphatically to put his side within touching distance of glory			0
an eerie silence engulfed @entity25 and but for a few thousand @entity230 clad in red and white , a sense of hopelessness began to emanate			0
@entity24 , to its credit , refused to give up the fight and came perilously close to equalizing within five minutes			0
@entity162 's exquisite free kick caused panic in the @entity2 defense and @entity155 sent a header crashing against the post when the ball seemed destined for the net			0
@entity24 , by now beginning to look ragged and forlorn , strained every sinew in an attempt to gain some sort of foothold to launch a comeback			0
but as the home side pushed forward , @entity2 countered and in doing so , swiftly put the tie beyond @entity24 's reach			1
once again , a wonderful switch of play caught @entity24 sleeping and after sending a powerful header against the crossbar from @entity183 's cross , @entity44 tucked away the rebound from his own effort			1
that strike sent @entity76 down the touchline dancing a jig of delight a @entity103 all those years ago			0
it is a jig he will hope to dance again in @entity52 with the whole world watching .			0

@entity2 will play @entity17 in @entity28 final
@entity2 defeated @entity24 3 - 1 at @entity25
two teams drew 0 - 0 in first leg last week
