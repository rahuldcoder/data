i left my daughter in my car on a hot summer day			1
it was in july 2007 , and i remember that day as if it were yesterday			2
my husband and i drove to @entity7			0
i wanted to buy herbs for my new garden			0
he wanted to buy power tools			0
our 5 - year - old son stayed behind with my mother , but we decided to bring our 14 - month - old baby girl along			1
she was cranky that day , and a car ride always soothed her and made her fall asleep			1
we strapped her into a rear - facing baby seat -- they 're safer			2
we parked , turned off the ignition , closed the sun roof tight and locked the doors			0
i went to get a shopping cart while my husband stood by the car waiting			2
we then walked together past the car and toward the crowded @entity7			2
walking into the garden center , my husband turned to me and said : " my @entity27			0
we left @entity28 in the car			1
" i screamed , dropped my purse , ran to the car and opened the door			1
the car was already warm			2
but she was fine and still sleeping			0
i was ashamed , embarrassed and horrified at what i had done			0
it dawned on me immediately -- i could have killed my girl			0
but the son of @entity40 , 22 - month - old @entity41 , did die			1
@entity40 left @entity41 in a hot car , strapped to his rear - facing seat in @entity45 last week , when he went into work at a @entity7 corporate office , according to a @entity49 criminal warrant			1
witnesses describe @entity40 ' reaction as very distressed , as he repeatedly asked : " what have i done ? " but investigators have implied that this might have been premeditated			1
police are still investigating , but @entity40 has pleaded not guilty to charges of child cruelty and felony murder			1
if he is convicted , he could spend the rest of his life in prison			0
but what if this was just a tragic accident -- the type of accident that happens every single year ? in 2013 , 44 children died from vehicle - induced heat stroke			1
about 450 children in the @entity70 have died this way since 1998			1
" it 's reasonable to call this an epidemic , " says memory expert @entity72 , a scientist at the @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76 , who is often consulted on such cases			0
" it happens , on average , once a week from spring to early fall			0
" parents everywhere are talking about the @entity40 tragedy -- in restaurants , in homes and on social media -- and many want him prosecuted even if this was an accident			2
on @entity92 , @entity91 writes : " if he 's not punished for his gross negligence , then that sends a get - out - of - jail - free card to all parents who are evil and want to murder their children			2
" @entity99 writes : " it 's beyond me how any parent can forget their baby in a car ! i was 15 when i had my first son and never managed to even almost forget either one of my three boys ! ever ! " before i left @entity28 in that hot car , i would have agreed with @entity91 and @entity99			1
i would have said that you must prosecute even those parents who leave their kids in a hot car accidentally because you must send a message to parents that they have an obligation to protect their children			1
before i left @entity28 in that hot car , i would have said that the anguish that this parent would feel is not enough of a punishment			1
had you asked me about one of these cases , i would have told you that i am a watchful mother and would never , ever do that			0
my husband did , too			0
if @entity125 left his son accidentally , he should not face charges			1
how can you prosecute a parent for accidentally leaving a child in a car ? there is no crime			0
and trust me , his anguish will be punishment enough			2
i punish myself all the time for leaving my girl in that car for a few minutes			0
so i 'm reserving judgment on this one			0
is there a history of abuse ? a bitter divorce and custody battle ? internet searches for how to kill a child ? is there evidence of intent -- or was this the case of a hardworking , harried , watchful , loving , adoring , protective parent who made a horrible mistake ? i hope by coming forward , i have prevented another parent from saying the words that are so hard for me to say : " i left my child in a car on a hot summer day			1

@entity40 ' *toddler* son died , left in a hot car while @entity40 went to work
@entity168 left her baby in a car on a hot day , but *quickly* *realized* it and ran back
children die every year from being left in hot cars by mistake ; 44 died in 2013
@entity168 : if it was a mistake , @entity40 should not face charges . anguish will be punishment
