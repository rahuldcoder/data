@entity0 , @entity1 -- there is n't a question that 's more quintessentially @entity5 than " what do you do for a living ? " it is just safe enough to start a conversation with a stranger , it is universal enough so anyone can answer , and it strikes right to the core of what our culture values most -- money			1
sure , on the surface that question does n't sound as if it 's been ripped from the @entity22 " greed is good " manifesto -- but the reality is it blows past the pleasantries and heads right into the grit of someone 's finances , revealing their place in the pecking order of society and thus a glimpse into just how happy they may or may not be			1
since the end of the 20th century , " what do you do for a living ? " has ceased to be an inquiry about how someone spends their time during normal business hours and instead serves as a slightly grating , socially acceptable manner in which we remind each other of the stuff we do n't have or will never get			1
we may understand that money does not buy happiness , but over the past few decades that notion has been competing against a message that at every turn tells us we ca n't be happy without it			1
this dichotomy has slowly disconnected the @entity5 dream from the idea of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness and attached it to one 's ability to move up the ladder			1
if you 're at a bar and someone 's response to that question is " i 'm a lawyer , " the people around generally assume that individual makes a lot of money , drives a fancy car and is not living paycheck to paycheck			1
he or she is happy , if you will			1
obviously this is not the same rosy outlook people have about someone who says " i work at @entity82 " -- if the person who is working in @entity83 's actually even says so			1
that 's not meant to slight people who work in the fast food industry , but to illustrate my point			1
in our culture a person 's worth is tied to his or her profession -- the higher the salary or profile , the more valued the individual is as a person , and the happier we assume he or she is			1
and sadly the reverse is also true			2
if it were n't , women would not feel the need to defend their decision to be stay - at - home moms in the era of the career woman			1
if it were n't , men would not feel challenged if they 're dating a woman who makes more			2
nowadays , with so many people either out of work or underemployed , i find that question can not only inject a small measure of shame into a conversation , but herd us into faceless categories like job creator or illegal immigrant			1
there 's nothing wrong with trying to pass the time by asking strangers nonthreatening questions			1
but why not ask about something not related to money , such as " when was the last time a moment took your breath away ? " -- getting back to what it means to be human as opposed to a consumer			2
yes , jobs , career , money are all realities and yes , we 've all got to eat			2
but what 's wrong with talking about good food as opposed to what we had to do to pay for it ? to me , the impetus behind @entity145 is not about jobs or failed policies			0
it 's a yearning to be valued again			0
to be heard and seen			0
some of us are guilty of buying houses we could n't afford or leaning on credit cards to live above our means			0
@entity154 created a business model that profits off of our desire to keep up with the @entity157			0
now the rugs been pulled from under us and we 're scared			0
in the title track of his second cd , bluesman @entity159 sings " life ai n't only supply and demand			0
" somewhere between the @entity166 and the first @entity167 , a lot of us have forgotten that			0
it seems now would be a good time to remember , because regardless of who wins the election in 2012 , most economists believe the waters will be choppy for some time after			2
unnerving , considering how much we 're already at each other 's throats			0
somehow we have to remember we are more than our credit score			0
we are more than what we do for a living			2
we are more than stuff			0
last week , in roughly 36 hours , i went from sipping coffee at a @entity183 in a midsized city in @entity1 , to ordering overpriced cocktails at a posh hotel lounge in @entity187 , to shaking my head disapprovingly as i drove by @entity190 flags that still flap in the wind in @entity192 , @entity193			0
along the way i found myself engaged in a number of casual conversations with some of my favorite kind of people -- strangers			1
it would make sense that folks from the @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 would have radically different approaches to life -- and in many ways they do -- but what i found amusing was that regardless of the zip code , it did not take long for the person i was talking to ask me what i do for a living			2
in some cases in @entity187 , they wanted to know that before they knew my name			0
it all seemed so callous and fake			0
then i remembered " what you do " is the new " who you are			0
" now it just all seemed so sad			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

@entity226 says @entity5 love to ask strangers : " what do you do for a living ? "
he says the once - *innocent* question has new meaning in a time of economic *turmoil*
it offers a window into how people are doing and in theory how happy they are , he says
@entity226 : we should be less *focused* on the material and more on the worth of people
