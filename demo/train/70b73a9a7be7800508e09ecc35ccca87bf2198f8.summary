-- is baseball hothead @entity1 right ? are the millions of us who never pitched beyond @entity5 just a bunch of starstruck wannabes ? during the @entity10 , the @entity9 star lashed out at the media after giving up seven earned runs in seven innings			1
" @entity16 questions , nerds ! " he hissed at reporters			1
on @entity18 , he called @entity20 scribe @entity19 a nerd who " was n't even a water boy in high school			2
" he stopped there , passing up the temptation to mock @entity19 's prom date or how much he can bench press			1
@entity1 's snotty attitude exists for one reason			1
many of my fellow baseball nuts do think players are cooler than the rest of us			1
the fact is , no matter how successful we may be in our professional lives , many of us would instantly trade in our careers for a ( your team here ) uniform			2
as my beloved @entity46 battle the @entity47 in the @entity48 this week , spotting my favorite players outside their natural habitat remains a thrill for me , even though i am old enough to be rookie @entity53 ' dad			1
still , i 'll appear stoic and resist the urge to ask for a picture or autograph			2
my inner child is disappointed but my dignity is intact			2
during a recent business trip to @entity61 , my celebrity - seeking was put to the ultimate test			1
i was staying at the same hotel as the visiting @entity46 ; my hunt began the moment i stepped off the plane : @entity67			2
1:45 p.m. @entity68 -- my friend and i are wearing @entity46 shirts , prompting our shuttle driver to mention he just took " a bunch of players with beards " on a deep sea fishing trip			1
one of the beards , he says , used to play for the @entity9 , and he " could n't stand up straight " when it was time to pick them up			2
@entity80 ! i am sitting on the same sweaty seat as @entity80 , the @entity83 animal who pulls off the @entity86 helmet look much better than @entity87			1
this is the guy who celebrates victory by punting beer cans to the crowd			2
2:30 p.m. @entity93 -- we check in at the front desk and again our sox shirts spark conversation			0
the clerk giddily tells us she once worked at an ice cream stand where she 'd scooped for ex-sox outfielder @entity99			0
i am intrigued , explaining that @entity99 is now a 30 - home run guy whom the @entity46 never should have traded to the @entity100			1
a few minutes later , as we 're walking past a seafood restaurant , an off - duty waitress rushes up to us			1
" you 'll never guess who i just saw ! " she gushes			0
it was slugger @entity106 -- not surprisingly , a fabulous tipper			0
he was my first guess because he is a larger - than - life caricature who ca n't hide behind sunglasses			2
i had been in @entity113 for only an hour and already three strangers felt compelled to share their sox sightings with anyone pretending to care			0
i care about @entity99 's favorite ice cream flavor and whether @entity106 ordered the swordfish or sea bass			2
and now i want some sightings of my own			0
being able to identify players in their civilian clothes , without the help of baseball cards , is an intoxicating game			2
so far , all i 've got is footprints			0
my hotel is the red carpet for @entity46 sightings , but also a forbidden zone			0
no autographs / no photography signs are posted everywhere to " protect the safety and privacy of all our resort guests			0
11:30 p.m. @entity138 -- i spot a diminutive bearded guy briskly walking toward me			0
it 's second baseman @entity141 , the 2008 @entity142			1
" hey , good game tonight ! " i say			0
@entity141 is wearing headphones and could have pretended to be absorbed by the music			1
but he turns back , stares at me with the same intensity he reserves for @entity147 , and says " thanks			0
" it was " thanks " with a period , not an exclamation point			0
but it was a long day and he certainly did n't lack any enthusiasm on the field			0
and then , just like in " @entity156 , " he vanishes			0
there 's an inherent awkwardness in fan - player meetings for both parties			1
we feel like we " know " them and briefly suspend the reality that we 're strangers			0
only @entity106 and @entity141 do n't have posters of us on their bedroom walls			1
if the opportunity existed for them to sit on the couch and watch a live video of us at work , they 'd be bored			0
the goal is to avoid becoming comedian @entity175 's obsessed fanboy character from " @entity176			1
" @entity175 meeting @entity177 : @entity175 : you remember when you were with the @entity180 ? @entity177 : yes			1
( @entity181 ) @entity175 : that was awesome ! day two			1
2 p.m. @entity138 -- near the front desk 's complimentary jellybean bar , i see the greatest @entity46 pitcher of all time , the retired @entity186 , blankly staring in my direction			1
i give him a friendly nod , the kind guys silently exchange in the halls at work or at the gym			0
he does n't pick up on the signal , so i do n't bother to tell him that the jellybeans are free			0
free ! then , just like a regular person , @entity186 checks into his room			0
i never saw @entity186 again			0
rest assured , i do n't need any self - esteem counseling about my failure to make the @entity201			2
i buy into the " @entity156 " @entity203 message that there are far more important things in life than baseball			0
but as i watch the @entity48 , forgive me if i temporarily transform into a @entity175 fanboy			1
and if i 'm lucky enough to score tickets , i know exactly what to yell to @entity141 during batting practice : " hey @entity212 , remember when we met late at night in that hotel lobby and i said , ' great game ! ' and you said ' thanks ' ? that was awesome ! " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			1

pitcher @entity1 mocked reporters as " ' nerds . " @entity221 says : *guilty* as charged
like many reporters , he 's a fanboy , and spent a recent @entity61 trip spotting ball players
a ride in *cab* where @entity80 had sat , a @entity141 sighting were thrilling , he says
@entity221 : the trick is not to become @entity175 - like fanboy . with series starting it 's not easy
