@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 smile as they shovel chips , with a mix of sand , into their mouths on a beach in @entity0 , @entity1			1
they dig in the sand and run from the waves			2
the @entity16 family looks like any other family on vacation , but this unplanned trip to @entity1 was where their brood grew from two children to four			1
@entity24 and @entity16 started the process to adopt siblings @entity3 , now 7 years old , and @entity4 , 5 , from a @entity27 orphanage in 2008			1
the adoption was to be completed next month when the family expected to move the children from a @entity31 , @entity27 , orphanage to their home in @entity34 , @entity35			1
but that orphanage partially collapsed in last week 's devastating earthquake			1
all 25 children there survived , but they had to move out onto the street			0
search lists of the missing and the found @entity43 said her family was lucky ; the good news about her children traveled quickly			1
" we knew they were safe , " she said , " but still when your kids are in danger nothing can be good enough unless you are with them			2
" the @entity52 heard that @entity3 and @entity4 might be among a small group of @entity27 children whose adoptions were set that the @entity57 military would fly to @entity1			1
so they packed up their other two children , @entity60 and @entity61 , and caught a flight to @entity0			0
on sunday as they checked into their hotel , the phone rang			0
it was the call they were hoping for			0
their children were indeed among the small group of children from the orphanage being evacuated to the @entity57			2
the flight was heading for an airport in central @entity1			1
the @entity52 jumped in their rental car and drove about four hours north			0
" we said their names and they looked over and their eyes got big and they got big smiles and they came over and hugged us and kissed us and just kept smiling , " @entity43 said			1
big brother @entity61 admitted he did n't enjoy the drive but said : " i was pretty excited			2
it was really fun to know that i can bring them home			0
" @entity3 and @entity4 were already familiar with their new family			1
they had met in @entity27 several times while the adoption process was slowly moving along			2
if there were any signs of trauma after the children 's ordeal , the @entity88 said they did not see them			0
watch how the children had been living outside " within probably 10 minutes all four kids were running around the customs area of the airport , playing and being noisy and acting like kids , " @entity43 said			0
and being kids was exactly how they appeared on the beach in @entity0			0
splashing , laughing and playing with language being no barrier for the four @entity105 children .			0
