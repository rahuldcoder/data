-- fans wandering through the @entity2 this weekend will encounter an ambitious array of audiovisual installations created by bands including @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
it 's all part of @entity2 's new partnership with the @entity11 , a program set up by @entity13 and @entity14 to connect artists with cutting - edge technology			1
@entity0 : choose the cover of @entity0 , round two : vote by april 14 ! the resulting collaborations will be visible all around the @entity2 grounds -- right up to the main stage itself , which @entity24 's @entity23 are building into a three - dimensional lighting sculpture that will move and unfold over the course of the festival			1
during @entity7 's saturday night set , this will be supplemented by a " psychedelic jumbletron , " otherwise known as a live collage of footage from the performance ( created with help from @entity7 's avant - garde pals @entity36 )			2
elsewhere on the site , attendees can drop by " untitled ( a physical manifestation of ' @entity40 ' ) " -- a cathedral - inspired structure filled with deconstructed portions of @entity44 's 1997 signature song produced in collaboration with director @entity46 -- or visit the dance - oriented @entity47 for a dazzling light show designed by @entity50 artist @entity49			2
@entity0 : random notes details on two further surprises @entity11 has planned for the @entity2 main stage remain strictly under wraps for now : @entity6 reunited with director @entity56 , who helmed their interactive video " @entity57 " last year , for a mysterious collaboration called " @entity59 , " and @entity8 is planning a top - secret work titled " @entity61			1
" adds @entity62 , @entity13 's vice president and chief marketing officer , " there 's an x factor when you have art and technology coming together			0
this is new territory for all of us -- that 's what makes it incredibly fun			0
