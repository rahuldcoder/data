@entity0 is entering a new era of kamikaze governance , this time with democrats at the helm			0
thursday night 's spending showdown saw progressive @entity3 unexpectedly emerge as the agitators ready to drive the nation off a cliff to win concessions — and progressives say it will happen again			1
" the fight last night was a shot across the bow that progressives are ready to stand and fight , and there are millions of @entity17 ready to jump into the fray , " @entity11 , @entity0 director for @entity12 , a progressive group , said on sunday			2
progressive members of the @entity3 are gearing up for what they expect to be many battles needed to defend their values as @entity23 seek to chip away at a variety of @entity3 priorities when they take control of @entity27 next year			1
a prime example of such skirmishes came last week			0
@entity31 sen. @entity30 objected to a @entity23 provision -- attached to a broad spending bill -- that rolled back a key portion of the @entity37 reform law			1
her opposition prompted dozens of @entity3 to defect and triggered a last - minute scramble for support ; president @entity41 himself made calls to win lawmakers back and stave off a potential government shutdown			1
the spending bill eventually passed the @entity48 on saturday night and on sunday , @entity3 leaders downplayed a possible rift within the party			0
but the nearly 2,000 progressive activists and operatives who descended on @entity0 over the weekend for the annual @entity54 gathering felt otherwise			0
panels addressed things like # @entity57 and the lack of understanding between the grassroots and establishment wings of the @entity3			0
and panelists and attendees alike endorsed the newly antagonistic moves from their elected officials this week			0
" how do we make change in general , as we 're seeing from the streets of @entity0 to @entity68 to @entity69 ? i do think that sometimes you have to shut it down , " said @entity70 , a 27 - year - old @entity54 attendee and an organizer with @entity72			2
and with republicans taking control of the @entity48 next month , the imperative for progressives to hold their ground on key issues could grow ever more urgent			2
@entity80 , a @entity3 strategist and former @entity48 leadership aide , said @entity23 have given every indication they 'll attempt to use a series of upcoming deadlines , including the need to raise the debt ceiling next year , to peel back @entity3 policies passed under @entity41			1
" what we saw just now is just a taste of what 's to come for two years , " he said			0
@entity41 's standing within the party diminished and @entity3 no longer feel beholden to their de facto leader — the president — as he enters the final , lame - duck years of his presidency			1
some now openly admit he 's going to have to navigate a difficult terrain within his own party in the new @entity27			1
@entity99 , the former national field director for @entity41 's re-election campaign , told @entity101 the left is still adjusting to the new political landscape			1
" everybody 's sort of figuring it out , post-midterms , how it 's all going to shake out , " he said of @entity41 's leadership role among @entity3			1
" i 'm sure there 'll be other disagreements			0
and it 's a different world with a @entity23 @entity48 and a @entity23 @entity113			1
" many progressives are frustrated with what they believe has been too much waffling from the president and other @entity3 leaders on the issues that matter most to the base -- behavior they argue contributed to their losses in the midterms			1
" all the @entity3 who lost were ones who ran to the center , " @entity70 said , echoing a frequent refrain heard from panelists at @entity54			0
that frustration has fueled a progressive backlash against the more moderate dealmakers in the party , and is what 's made @entity134 so attractive to so many , her supporters believe			2
@entity135 , who heads a grassroots super pac working to draft @entity134 to run for president , said the issue with candidates in the midterm was they were " afraid " to stand on their principles			1
" we ca n't have candidates who are afraid to take risks and say what they believe in and stand up for something , " she said			0
" you ca n't just have these @entity3 who are everything to everyone and play things very safe and are picked by party insiders to not offend anyone			0
" @entity135 said the watered down soundbites are meaningless to voters , whereas , " @entity134 's style of being unafraid of who she is , of being honest , of speaking up " resonates			0
campaign - trail fallout the elevation of @entity134 as a prominent figure in these policy fights , and of @entity37 reform as a key issue for progressives , is certain to put former secretary of state @entity165 in a difficult spot as she prepares for a potential presidential bid			2
more than 300 former @entity41 campaign staffers signed a letter urging @entity134 to run for president this week			1
@entity172 , meanwhile , continues to face skepticism from progressives who believe she 's too cozy with @entity37			2
and while @entity134 has repeatedly said she 's not interested in a run , her supporters believe even having her in the mix , and focusing the conversation on @entity37 reform , could help shape @entity172 's potential candidacy			0
indeed , the activity surrounding @entity134 , and the emerging rift within the party , had even @entity3 officials on friday predicting a spirited primary battle for the presidential nomination			0
" regardless of who decides to run , we 're gon na have a really competitive and interesting primary process , " said @entity187 , the @entity189 's digital director .			2

a bruising midterm election has prompted a backlash from progressives in @entity27
they see @entity30 , not president @entity41 , as their leader
they 're expecting significant battles with @entity23 to defend their priorities
