@entity0 -- for years , nobel peace laureate @entity2 has been speaking out against human rights violations in her country of @entity5 , where her defense of political prisoners and support for human rights and democracy have earned her the ire of the ruling regime			1
in 2008 , @entity5 authorities shut down the @entity14 , of which she is president , and since 2009 , she has been living in exile			1
@entity2 is now in the @entity16 to promote her latest book , " @entity18 : @entity19 , @entity20 , one @entity21 " ( @entity22 , 2011 )			1
the book tells the story of an @entity5 family torn apart by competing ideologies			1
@entity27 interviewed her at @entity29 in @entity0			1
here is an edited transcript			2
question : in your book , " @entity18 , " the first sentence quotes @entity5 sociologist dr. @entity36 saying : " if you ca n't eliminate injustice , at least tell everyone about it			1
" but some people ask , " what 's the use of speaking out ? " and does the @entity44 of @entity5 care when others criticize its human rights record ? answer : if no one speaks out when a government violates human rights and uses oppression , this oppression continues			1
but when people are informed , they gradually become aware , and when they become aware , they begin to object			2
no change happens in society unless people become aware			2
q : and does the @entity44 care ? a : about the @entity44 , it 's the same			0
in 1988 , there was a massacre of political prisoners in @entity5			1
at that time , there was no internet , people could n't spread news much to one another , and very few knew of this story			0
as a result , @entity5 's government quietly continued			1
but [ after @entity5 's disputed presidential election in ] june 2009 , with the help of the internet , people took photographs and film of the many individuals who were killed in the streets , then put these images on @entity79			1
the whole world understood what was happening			0
for example , the killing of @entity83 [ a young @entity5 woman shot to death at a protest ] shook the world			1
q : what more could or should the @entity16 government and the international community do about @entity5 's human rights record ? a : the development of democracy and human rights in any country is the duty of that country 's people , and foreign countries must watch from a distance and provide help without interfering in internal affairs			1
it was very important that the @entity16 government and other member countries of the @entity106 voted to condemn @entity5 's human rights violations and to assign a special @entity106 rapporteur on human rights for @entity5			1
it was also important that the @entity16 announced travel bans and asset freezes for certain @entity5 individuals who have had a direct role in killing or repressing the @entity5 people			1
this is not interference in @entity5 's domestic affairs but support of the people			1
... these types of steps must continue			0
q : how can citizens of the @entity16 , @entity125 , and other countries help promote human rights in @entity5 ? a : they can do the most			1
when you vote , vote for those who are not warmongers , and vote for those who respect human rights			0
when you see a president who does n't respect human rights , do n't vote for that person			0
in fact , i have always said that @entity16 policy wo n't change unless the @entity16 people change , and the @entity16 people wo n't change unless they get more information about the world			0
so this is our duty , to give necessary information to the people			0
q : and in your opinion , does the current @entity16 president respect human rights ? a : mr. @entity154 has so far shown that he respects human rights			0
q : at a talk at @entity159 , you said that @entity5 's @entity160 has in no way become weaker but has just changed its form of resistance			1
what hope is there that the movement for democracy in @entity5 will prevail ? a : there is a lot of hope that the people of @entity5 will prevail because fortunately they do n't resort to violence , they continue their resistance , and also the economic situation is very bad			1
the price of food in @entity177 has even become more expensive than in the @entity16			0
and most importantly , many divisions have formed among conservatives			0
altogether , these factors will cause the regime to weaken			0
q : will we see the democratic movement prevail in our lives ? a : this depends on whether i die tomorrow or in another 30 years			2
q : let 's say you live another 30 years			0
will we see it ? a : yes , within 30 years , of course			0
q : what influence do revolutions and protests in countries such as @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 have on @entity5 's democracy movement ? a : @entity200 is the @entity44 's only ally in the @entity204 , and it is not only an ally but also a puppet of @entity5			1
a revolution has begun in @entity200 , and the people there are protesting against the dictatorship of the @entity212			0
if they succeed in bringing democracy to @entity200 , this will help democracy in @entity5 a great deal			1
in @entity219 and @entity199 , democracy will also help @entity5 very much , and the people coming to power in those countries will help democracy in @entity5 progress			1
in @entity198 , the fundamentalists are strong , and in the beginning , it 's possible they will be very close to the @entity5 government , but they wo n't become a puppet of @entity5 because they are @entity230 , while the @entity5 are @entity231 , and feelings of racism exist between the @entity5 government and @entity236 governments			1
there are no common interests between @entity5 and @entity198			1
also , @entity198 sees itself as a big brother of @entity241 and @entity236 countries , and @entity5 also sees itself as a leader of @entity241 countries , ... so while @entity198 and @entity5 will build political relations , @entity198 certainly wo n't transform into a puppet of @entity5			1
q : what about events in @entity249 ? a : in @entity249 and @entity250 , the @entity231 have protested because they faced discrimination and their situation is not good			0
@entity231 are being killed , and this has caused the @entity5 government to support them			1
@entity5 even wrote a letter to the @entity256 and requested that the issue be sent to the @entity258			2
the @entity259 has remained quiet , while @entity5 tells the @entity231 that you see , we are the only country supporting you			2
it is clear that when the people of @entity250 and @entity249 reach power , @entity5 will have a lot of influence on them			2
the best path is for the @entity259 , especially the @entity16 , not to remain indifferent toward the repression of the @entity231 people in @entity249 and @entity250			0
q : as you know , when i was in prison in @entity5 , i wanted to retain you , as well as your colleagues mr. @entity275 and mr. @entity277 , as my attorneys , but the authorities pressured my father and me not to work with you			2
i realize that many prisoners in @entity5 suffered and are suffering more than i did			2
but to what extent was my experience representative of the experiences of many other prisoners and attorneys in @entity5 , and what kind of pressures do attorneys there face ? a : if @entity5 attorneys want to defend political prisoners , problems will certainly be created for them			2
for example , @entity294 has been sentenced to 11 years in prison			0
... mr. [ @entity298 ] @entity297 was sentenced to nine years in prison			0
after the 2009 election , mr. [ @entity299 ] @entity275 and mr. [ @entity277 went to prison			0
they are now free on bail			0
mrs. @entity305 , mr. @entity306 and me -- all of us were forced to come out of the country because of harassment by the authorities			0
so you see that every person who supports political prisoners becomes the target of the regime 's anger			0
moreover , the court forces political prisoners to choose from among the attorneys who work with the regime itself and who are puppets of the @entity323			0
q : during these past few years , particularly under the presidency of @entity329 , what changes for women 's rights have you seen in @entity5 ? a : there have been no changes , except that the repression has become greater for women			2
there has been no change in the laws , but whatever happened has not been in women 's interests			0
q : you talked about your being abroad			0
what positive or negative aspects does your exile have for your human rights efforts ? a : i preferred to be in @entity5 , but the situation there is such that because of censorship and repression , there is no possibility for any kind of human rights activity .			2
