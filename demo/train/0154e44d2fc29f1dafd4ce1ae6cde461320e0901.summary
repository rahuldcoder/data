-- is @entity1 a hero ? @entity4 citizens -- and @entity1 fans and haters alike -- have been debating this question since gov. @entity8 announced he would fly the state 's flags at half - staff for the singer saturday as mourners attend her funeral in @entity15 , @entity4			1
@entity8 's decision has been widely criticized -- 77 % of @entity19 readers called it " inappropriate " in one informal and unscientific poll			1
but he has strongly defended the order , hailing @entity1 as " a daughter of @entity4 " who should be honored for her " cultural contributions			1
" for decisions like this , there is a federal " @entity28 , " which stipulates only that the flag be flown at half - staff to honor deaths of certain public officials , adding that governors can honor members of the government or military from their state			1
opinion : @entity1 's glorious voice but regardless of what the official code says , the standards around flag - flying have been fuzzy for years			1
most of @entity8 's prior orders to lower the flag have honored service members killed in combat , yet he issued the same order after the death of @entity51 , the saxophonist for @entity53 's @entity52			1
@entity54 received the honor years earlier			2
so there 's some precedent here for musicians , and @entity1 's astronomical album sales certainly make the case for her cultural influence			2
her ascent from humble @entity4 roots to pop superstardom offers a source of pride for @entity8 and other @entity70			1
and flying a flag at half - staff could provide a form of collective mourning , a way to rally a community around things they share -- like a hometown hero whose music touched countless people throughout the state and around the world			1
is all that enough to merit an honor usually reserved for people who 've performed tremendous services -- and made incomparable sacrifices -- for their country ? true , @entity1 's rendition of " @entity89 " is by far the most acclaimed ( and best - selling ) recording of the national anthem by a pop singer			1
but should that enter her into the ranks of @entity97 heroes ? indeed , giving this honor to @entity1 seems to illustrate what psychologists @entity99 and @entity101 have called our increasingly " watered - down " view of heroism			1
@entity99 and @entity101 argue that we pay a cultural price when we praise athletes and celebrities as " heroes " : we lose sight of the strong moral qualities that should define heroism , and we lose touch with what it takes to nurture more demanding forms of heroism			0
" by diminishing the ideal of heroism , " they write , " we keep ourselves from confronting the older , more demanding forms of this ideal			0
we do not have to challenge ourselves to see if , when faced with a situation that called for courage , we would meet that test			0
" through their research , @entity99 and @entity101 have come up with their own criteria for what constitutes a hero			0
for one thing , heroism entails some type of quest , for example to save a life or to uphold a principle			0
it also involves real sacrifice or risk , including a risk of one 's own life			0
who meets these standards ? the 30 service members for whom @entity8 has lowered the flag clearly do			2
in fact , the sad truth is that for more than a decade , @entity1 sat on the end of the moral spectrum opposite from presidents and war heroes			0
her struggles with drug addiction and her troubled marriage to @entity157 tarnished her public image			0
she became an object of scorn and derision			0
and , ultimately , i suspect that this is part of the reason we 're seeing such effusive tributes to her now			0
yes , some critics of @entity8 's half - staff decision say it sends the wrong message to give this level of recognition to someone with a history of substance abuse			1
but i ca n't shake the feeling that the official , government - sanctioned respect @entity1 is getting in her death is on some level a reaction to all the insults she endured in her life			2
when @entity1 's life and voice fell apart , many of her onetime fans and longtime critics showed little sympathy			2
the flag flying at half - staff feels like a way not just to honor her virtues as an artist , but to show remorse for how she was treated as a person			1
" what i would say to everybody is , ' there but for the grace of @entity206 go i , ' " @entity8 said			0
but i do n't remember any politician embracing her as " @entity4 's daughter " after she did her embarrassing " crack is wack " interview with @entity210 , after she checked into rehab , or after @entity157 was charged with physically abusing her			2
in that light , a flag flying at half - staff seems more like an apology than an honor -- an act of contrition for spurning a women who suffered addiction and abuse			1
behind the tributes lies guilt and , too late , some compassion			0
@entity8 says he believes people are questioning his decision because of @entity1 's drug problems			1
but maybe it 's partly because of her troubles , not in spite of them , that she 's being honored			2

flags are flying at half - staff in @entity4 to honor @entity1
gov. @entity8 's decision to honor singer in this way received some criticism
@entity240 : @entity1 may not have fit *definition* of those normally honored this way
he says the honor shows remorse for failing to support her in her troubles
