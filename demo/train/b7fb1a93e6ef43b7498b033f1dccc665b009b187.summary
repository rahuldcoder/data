, is the " world 's worst dog			2
" in " @entity6 , " @entity4 and @entity5 's characters welcome a dog into their lives			1
he 's friendly and lovable , but he devours everything in sight -- drywall , socks , big chunks of furniture ( no , he does n't just chew on them , he eats them )			0
as a dog owner , i can testify that " @entity6 , " based on the real @entity30 's smash 2005 memoir , is the single most endearing and authentic movie about the human - canine connection in decades			1
as directed by @entity32 ( " @entity33 " ) , though , it 's also something more : a disarmingly enjoyable , wholehearted comic vision of the happy messiness of family life			2
@entity2 and @entity3 share an existence that , from the standpoint of our current economic times , already looks like paradise			0
he 's a reporter who gets refashioned , by his testy editor ( @entity43 ) , into a lifestyle columnist ( only to keep complaining about it -- poor guy ! )			0
she 's a feature writer who becomes a stay - at - home mom			0
as the kids come along ( three of them ) , the @entity49 move into bigger and bigger houses , yet they have thwarted ambitions , fights that go on for days , and a general attitude of wistful loss toward all the freedoms they have given up to become parents			0
" @entity6 " celebrates two ordinary people as they try to fit love , work , children , and one volcanically misbehaved pooch into a single space			1
@entity6 may be the dog from hell , but we 're meant to see that the @entity49 , in their hearts , would n't have it any other way			1
@entity6 stands in for all the unruliness that can never be domesticated out of life			1
you can domesticate @entity4 , but the shock is how good the role of beleaguered breadwinner looks on him			2
he and @entity5 forge a nimble connection ( they even get mad in style ) , and @entity4 has a scene near the end with @entity6 that 's the most wrenchingly tender acting of his career			1
using his scratchy , lackadaisical warmth to voice a testament to family , and to where dogs fit into it , he makes you feel like it 's a wonderful life indeed			0
