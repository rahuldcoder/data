-- inventor @entity1 may have died alone and broke , but he has powerful friends who want to preserve his legacy			1
cartoonist @entity5 , the brain behind " the oatmeal , " is one			1
using his popular web comic , @entity8 launched an effort to turn @entity1 's former laboratory in @entity12 , @entity13 , into a museum			1
@entity1 , who lived from 1856 to 1943 , developed the basis for @entity18 power , among other ideas and innovations that have shaped our lives			1
he obtained more than 100 patents , according to the @entity25 of @entity13			0
@entity8 partnered with the @entity26 , a nonprofit group , to generate widespread interest in a museum			0
the cartoonist sang the inventor 's praises in a humorous , profane comic hailing @entity1 as superior to the better - known @entity33 ( " basically , @entity1 = @entity32			1
ever , " @entity8 wrote )			0
through the crowdfunding website @entity34 , the nonprofit and @entity8 stirred up more than $ 1.3 million in 2012 , when the facility and land were put up for sale			2
that was enough money to save the property , but not quite what was needed to renovate it for an actual museum			0
from grains of ' oatmeal , ' big things for cartoonist so this week @entity8 turned to a man who has become a household name in his own right : @entity53 , ceo of @entity54 and @entity55 , which is named for the inventor			1
@entity8 published an oatmeal comic called " what it 's like to own a @entity62 , " bursting with enthusiasm about owning the electric car , and then appealed to @entity53 in a second installment			2
" @entity53 , if you 're reading this : you owe us nothing , and you 've done nothing but good things in the name of @entity1 , " @entity8 wrote in his endearing handwriting-esque typeface			1
" but the fact remains : @entity55 , a company now worth billions , is using @entity1 's name and they 're using his technology , and all we want in return is a little bit of help			2
" @entity8 wrote that automobiles have @entity18 induction motors and bear the @entity1 name , despite the fact that no one from @entity1 's family was involved in founding the car company			2
according to the @entity25 of @entity13 , @entity1 invented the @entity18 induction motor , which he sold to @entity85 in 1888			0
" but the idea of a car company using someone else 's family name without any formal connection to them is a slightly arresting notion , " @entity8 wrote			0
" it would be like naming a company ' @entity95 ' 50 years from now , regardless of any ties to @entity97 or @entity98 himself			0
" during the initial fundraiser for the museum , @entity53 donated $ 2,500 , @entity8 wrote			2
but what the @entity102 would need to open , he said , is another jolt of $ 8 million			1
@entity8 tweeted tuesday " @ elonmusk i wrote a review of my @entity62 , and then asked you for a little favor here [ link ]			0
" to the delight of many @entity112 users , @entity53 tweeted back : " @ oatmeal i would be happy to help			1
" of course , we do n't know if " help " means the full $ 8 million or much less			1
@entity53 's @entity55 declined to say how much @entity53 would donate			0
but for fans of @entity1 's work and legacy , the possibility is electrifying			0
@entity120 is on @entity112 at @ lizlandau @entity122 's @entity121 contributed to this report .			0
