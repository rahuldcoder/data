-- the @entity1 recently announced that it is no longer recommending prostate cancer screening for men			1
a spokesman for the @entity5 told @entity0 the recommendation is " a tremendous mistake , " but the senior author of the task force 's report says the prostate specific antigen , or @entity12 , test does more harm than good			2
the report says that cancers detected by the test are often slow - growing and would never be harmful , but that treatment could render a man impotent or incontinent or kill him			2
it 's a debate that 's ongoing for several other types of screening as well , but not all are in contention			0
here 's what you should know about the four most common types of pre-symptom cancer screenings , including the leading experts ' recommendations and what the test involves : prostate cancer prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer among men , with approximately 30,000 dying from the disease each year			1
the @entity38 recommends that men over 50 with no special risk factors talk to their doctors and decide on an individual basis -- after weighing the risks of treatment -- if they want to be screened			0
the @entity45 says that making an informed decision about screening is important , but that all men with a life expectancy of 10 years or more should have a baseline @entity12 test at the age of 40			2
prostate cancer screenings include a blood test for elevated levels of the prostate specific antigen protein and a digital rectal examination			1
during the digital rectal exam , a doctor will insert a lubricated , gloved finger into the rectum to feel for abnormalities in the prostate			1
breast cancer the chance of developing invasive breast cancer for @entity67 women is a little less than one in eight , according to the @entity38			1
the @entity1 released a statement two years ago recommending against yearly mammograms for breast cancer for women in their 40s			1
the task force said the benefits did n't significantly outweigh the risks			0
however , the @entity38 and the @entity76 for the @entity78 foundation have fought against this recommendation			0
mammograms have helped reduce breast cancer mortality rates in the @entity67 by nearly one - third since 1990 , according to the @entity82			1
the @entity83 and the @entity84 recommend that women age 40 and older get screened for breast cancer every one to two years			1
a mammogram is basically an x-ray of the breast			2
plates flatten the breast tissue to take a more accurate photo , often from two angles , which can be uncomfortable but only takes a moment			2
the photos are then analyzed for calcifications , which appear as white dots , and any mass that looks abnormal such as a cyst or tumor			0
colorectal cancer colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer - related death , but also one of the most curable if caught early			1
the tests that the @entity84 recommends for both men and women over the age of 50 to screen for colorectal cancer and polyps include a flexible sigmoidoscopy , a colonoscopy , a double - contrast barium enema and a virtual colonoscopy			1
however the @entity38 says only the colonoscopy can see the complete colon and is best for screening			0
the @entity67 @entity121 agrees , giving colorectal screenings an " a " grade			1
during a colonoscopy , a thin tube is inserted through the rectum and into the colon			0
the tube has a light and camera - like apparatus for viewing any polyps or unusual pieces of tissue			0
complications from colonoscopy are rare , but can include tears in the lining of the colon			0
cervical cancer the number of cases of cervical cancer has decreased significantly in the @entity67 over the past 40 years thanks to regular screenings , according to the @entity142			1
in 2007 , 4,021 women died from the disease			0
@entity38 recommends yearly @entity146 tests for all women beginning at age 21 , or three years after they begin having intercourse			0
at age 30 women may choose to reduce screenings to once every two or three years until they are 70 years old			2
do not confuse a pap test with a pelvic exam , the @entity38 warns			0
a pap test will include a gentle scraping of your cervix with a spatula - looking instrument ; the cells collected will be sent to a lab for analysis			2
this is usually done at the start of a pelvic exam , after the doctor has inserted a speculum into the vagina .			0
