-- when former death row inmate @entity2 left a @entity4 prison in 2003 he was one of the lucky ones			1
he had the support of his family and the lawyers who had worked for more than a decade to prove his innocence in the 1984 shooting death of a hotel executive from a prominent @entity13 family			2
within six months of his release , he was married and holding down a steady job			2
by 2005 , he had a brand new home , a car and a dog			2
he and his wife were running their own sandwich shop in a hotel in downtown @entity13			0
" i was almost getting to feel the @entity27 dream , " said @entity2 , who spent 18 years in prison , 14 of them on @entity4 's death row			1
then , @entity28 hit and wiped out his home , his business and the life he 'd been struggling to build after nearly two decades locked up			0
he looked around and realized he was not alone in his struggle to ease back into society			2
he also wondered where the resources were for people like him who did n't know how to use email , find a doctor or apply for a driver 's license and social security card to apply for jobs			2
" men come home and the system has nothing in place to help them put their lives back together , " he said			0
" they need to be reprogrammed because the survival tactics they learned in prison do n't work in the outside world			0
" to help them @entity2 started resurrection after @entity54 , an education and outreach program that helps exonerated and formerly incarcerated inmates rebuild their lives			1
again , he says he was lucky because he knew people who could help him write grant applications and navigate the waters of the non-profit world			0
but it takes more than good fortune and connections to make a go of it after spending nearly two decades in prison , said @entity68 , one of @entity2 's appellate lawyers			1
" he 's proven himself to be resilient , resourceful and compassionate in ways that are unimaginable given his situation , " said @entity68 , who helped @entity2 win his freedom			1
banks and his colleague @entity75 helped reverse @entity2 's capital murder conviction based on evidence that the @entity79 's @entity78 concealed blood evidence that would have cast doubt on its case			1
district attorney @entity83 , father of the entertainer on tv 's " @entity85 , " reportedly defended his team at the time			2
" we follow the rules , " @entity83 reportedly told @entity88			0
" we have an ongoing and continuing obligation to turn over exculpatory evidence and we do			2
" in a retrial , jurors acquitted @entity2 of all charges			1
" we felt good about the retrial , the evidence suggested we were going to win , " @entity68 said			1
" we were worried about what happens next , after he walks out of prison after 18 years			1
" there 's not a lot of vocational training on death row ; the only thing you 're trained for is to learn to die			1
" @entity2 's lawyers tried to convince him to go to a residential counseling program in @entity107			1
but he insisted on staying in @entity13 to be close to his mother and sons , who were four and six when they saw police take him away in handcuffs in 1985			0
the first place @entity2 visited when he left prison was his old neighborhood , where he received a hero 's welcome complete with @entity118 beads , @entity68 recalled			1
however , over a seafood dinner at @entity120 -- his first as a free man -- he made it clear that he did not want to return to his previous life , @entity68 said			0
" he knew from the minute he got out , ' i do n't want to go back to this old world because this will eat me alive , ' " @entity68 said			0
" he was a 10th grade dropout with no money , no atm card , he 'd never used a cellphone or a computer			0
the temptation of street crime , drugs and poverty seemed overwhelming			0
but to his credit he had the emotional intelligence and strength to pursue a different path			0
" still , it 's been a bumpy road			2
@entity2 won $ 14 million in damages after suing the @entity13 district attorney 's office for violating his federal civil rights by hiding blood tests that would have proven his innocence			1
the state appealed and the case went all the way to the @entity27 @entity150 , which overturned the judgment in a sharply divided 5 - 4 decision			0
read the @entity150 opinion that -- coupled with @entity28 -- led @entity2 to dedicate his life to fighting for the rights of other exonerees			1
state laws vary when it comes compensation , but in @entity4 exonerated inmates are eligible for $ 25,000 per year for each year of wrongful incarceration with a $ 250,000 cap			2
but former inmates need more than money , @entity2 said			1
they need guidance and mentoring to help them manage it wisely			0
besides , they should n't have to wait for compensation to find services essential to their transition and rehabilitation , he said			0
" we think states and cities should provide housing and job training			0
they should n't have to wait for compensation to find those services , " said @entity2			1
resurrection after @entity54 offers a variety of services to former inmates			2
the nondescript building in @entity13 ' famous @entity188 neighborhood provides temporary housing for four people while helping them develop a five - year plan , @entity2 said			1
the first stage involves a lengthy evaluation to get to know the former inmate and to get them back on the grid with a social security card , driver 's license and doctor 's appointments			1
the organization also helps reconnect them with family or friends who can provide a support system			0
next , they start job training by learning computer skills and building resumes			0
they also go through a long mental health checklist to ensure that the ex-inmate possesses the self - awareness to deal with lingering effects of prison			0
if needed , counseling referrals are provided			0
" if you ca n't identify and deal with the trauma you fall into depression , and look to drugs and alcohol to escape reality , " said @entity2			1
" that 's what keeps these guys from getting over the hump and moving forward			2
" the organization also teaches participants how to tell their story so they can participate in community outreach efforts			0
these are key to build empathy and understanding of the needs of inmates returning to society , @entity2 said			1
like it or not , these people are going to be in the community ; it 's society 's responsibility to help give them a fighting chance , he said			1
@entity2 and other members of @entity243 visit high schools and law schools to tell their stories			1
in addition the organization hosts " @entity249 " classes for practicing lawyers , students and members of the community			0
@entity2 also finds time to work with chapters of the @entity256 , lobbying for federal guidelines related to compensation and looking for extreme cases of wrongful convictions across the country to cast a spotlight on the national scope of the problem			1
" we need to make everyone aware of the importance of accountability and oversight when it comes to prosecutions , " he said			0
" when you send one person away it destroys entire families			0
