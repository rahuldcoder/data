@entity0 -- a spokeswoman for @entity3 said the embattled director of national intelligence stands by remarks he made thursday " about the current military situation in @entity7 " that prompted a leading @entity9 senator to call for his resignation			1
the @entity12 administration also said @entity3 still has its " full faith and confidence			2
" sen. @entity15 , @entity17 - @entity16 , a member of the @entity18 , issued a statement criticizing @entity3 's testimony , made during a committee hearing earlier in the day , that @entity23 's regime would " prevail " over rebels seeking to oust the 68 - year - old dictator from power in @entity7			1
" his comments will make the situation more difficult for those opposing @entity23 , " said @entity15 , adding they undercut @entity29 efforts and should not have been made in a public forum			2
@entity15 cited two previous occasions in which @entity3 made misstatements , and said his comments on the @entity7 situation " should be the final straw			1
" @entity39 , director of public affairs for the @entity41 , said that @entity3 's testimony " provided a snapshot of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the regime and the opposition			1
as he stated in his testimony , the situation in @entity7 is very fluid			2
" " many factors will come into play over time including the pressure being brought to bear by the international community as well as the @entity7 people 's clear desire for change , " @entity39 said			2
" as this dynamic situation evolves , the @entity55 will continue to provide its best assessment of the current situation as well as identify opportunities that project into the future			0
" @entity3 's comment on @entity7 was not the only one that got him in trouble with some members of the armed services committee			2
in an exchange with @entity69 sens. @entity68 of @entity70 and @entity71 of @entity72 over what nation posed the greatest threat to the @entity29 , the director focused his responses on the chief nuclear rivals , @entity77 and @entity78 , rather than on the regimes in @entity80 and @entity81 , which are openly belligerent			1
@entity3 went on to clarify his answer , to which @entity68 gave lukewarm acceptance , but later thursday , @entity86 chairman @entity85 , @entity87 , called the director 's response on the threat issue " a problem " and , when asked by @entity1 , pointedly declined to say she had confidence in him			1
" on the question on the two nations with the greatest intent to harm ours , i do not believe they 're @entity77 and @entity78 , " said @entity85 , who was not at the hearing			1
" i do n't understand why that was put out there			0
so , that 's a problem			0
" asked whether @entity3 has problems communicating , @entity85 responded , " i do n't know what it is and i 'm not going to speculate , but clearly there 's a problem ... i would like the opportunity to look more deeply into it , ok ? " other senators , including @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111 , a @entity113 independent who caucuses with @entity69 , expressed support for @entity3			2
@entity109 said the director was " doing a very fine job			0
" @entity118 press secretary @entity117 defended @entity3 and said his words were misinterpreted			0
" if you look closely at the transcript of what @entity122 said , he was answering a question with regard to military capacity , " @entity117 said			0
" obviously , @entity78 and @entity77 are two of the three largest nuclear powers in the world , therefore they have dangerous weapons and they have the capacity , but he made clear that we do not view @entity78 and @entity77 as a threat			1
" and in a follow - up answer regarding @entity3 's @entity7 statement , @entity117 said @entity15 's response " was based on a real misinterpretation of what @entity122 said today			1
" asked if the president still had confidence in @entity3 , @entity117 said , " yes , full faith and confidence			0
" in a conference - call phone briefing thursday night , national security adviser @entity143 said he believed @entity3 " was presenting a kind of a flat - out resources analysis " of the situation in @entity7			1
" he went through the kind of equipment and resources that the regime has			0
" and i think if you look at it , he said from a standpoint of attrition , if you do an attrition analysis , you get to his conclusion			0
" in the same conference call , deputy national security adviser @entity158 addressed the issue of specific adversary nations , saying the issue is " a matter of capability ( in the case of @entity77 and @entity78 ) versus intent " to be a @entity29 adversary " that leads you to focus on nations such as @entity80 , organizations such as @entity172 , who again are a great focus of what we do here every day			1
" that seemed to be the thrust of @entity3 's protracted exchange on thursday after @entity71 asked @entity3 what nations he thought posed the greatest threat to the @entity29			1
@entity3 said @entity78 and @entity77 posed a mortal threat , citing their nuclear arsenals and military capabilities			1
but he added that he did n't think either nation had the intent to strike the @entity29			0
that clearly was not the answer @entity68 expected			0
. " you did n't mention @entity81 or @entity80 , which would have been the first two countries i would have thought of in response to that question , " the committee chairman			0
" i was really kind of taken aback almost by your answer			0
" @entity3 explained that he interpreted the question to be what countries pose a " mortal threat " to the @entity29			1
" @entity81 and @entity80 are , you know of great concern			0
i do n't know at this point in time they pose a direct mortal threat to the continental @entity29 , " he said			2
@entity68 pressed @entity3 on whether @entity78 and @entity77 were a direct mortal threat to the @entity29 , and @entity3 reiterated that they both had the capability , but it was unlikely they had the intent			1
@entity68 then flipped the question : " by that measure we represent the direct mortal threat to both of them , right ? " @entity3 seemed to avoid a direct answer but eventually answered yes			1
@entity71 stepped in to to see if he could clarify @entity3 's position by asking which nation has the intent to be the greatest adversary			2
@entity3 answered , " probably @entity77 , " which once again set @entity68 off			1
" i 'm just as surprised by that answer as i was by your first answer , " @entity68 said			0
@entity3 tried to explain that he was " loath " to pick one country and restated that both @entity77 and @entity78 have the capability , but he did n't think either had the intent			1
@entity68 suggested @entity3 needs to be more careful with his words			2
" when the director of national intelligence talks about what are the greatest threats , unless he starts with capabilities , and uses that , and does n't just answer ' @entity77 and @entity78 ' the way he did -- i was concerned by the answer			1
" after the hearing , @entity68 issued a statement saying , " i was taken aback by @entity122 's statement about @entity77 and @entity78 and , frankly , i was surprised by how long it took him to correct the impression that he created			1
he did finally correct it , however , and i am glad that he did , and i am satisfied with his correction			0
" this is n't the first time @entity3 has had to explain comments he has made			2
he was called on the carpet last month for referring to the @entity245 in @entity246 as a secular organization at another congressional hearing			0
and during an interview with @entity250 in december 2010 , @entity3 appeared unaware of a terrorist plot that had been interrupted in @entity252 earlier in the day			0
in both cases , the @entity41 put out statements on @entity3 's behalf			0
in the instance of the @entity250 interview , the office said the director had not been briefed on the @entity252 terror plot .			0
