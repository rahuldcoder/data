@entity0 -- backstage at the @entity3 show , a strange air of calm hangs over the make - up area			2
although security is predictably tight , there is no screaming or high drama			2
it 's 7.30 a.m. , hours before the show , and the machine is just beginning to mobilize			1
@entity14 is an early arrival , quietly sitting in a chair listening to her @entity17 as a make - up artist begins to apply foundation			1
her cup of coffee and bottle of green tea reveal that even the women dubbed " @entity26 's first supermodel " finds early starts challenging			1
but there is no trace of fatigue : her face looks flawless with little make up , and her skin luminous			2
" today i have five shows , so we 'll be running around			0
" yesterday i was really happy because my agent sent me the schedule			0
i still love it because i love walking the runway			0
" at the age of 23 , @entity14 has worked for most of the world 's prestigious fashion houses , and recently ascended into the top tier of models who are recognizable enough to command major fees			1
she has also broken molds , becoming the first @entity48 model named as a global spokesperson for @entity50			1
with some two million followers on a mandarin - language version of @entity56 , her ability to sell products to the prized @entity26 consumer is obvious			1
" when we met her in person , we were so impressed with her warmth , beauty and enthusiasm , " says @entity57 , the firm 's style and image director			2
" it 's amazing to see how consumers respond to @entity14 -- she has so many fans , not only in @entity26 , but around the world as well			1
" some of those fans gathered for an @entity50 event at the start of @entity72 , where @entity1 first met her			1
amid the flashbulbs and relentless dance music , @entity74 cheerfully signed autographs and posed for photos , seemingly enjoying the spectacle			1
a few days later , @entity1 caught up with her as she shuttled between assignments in a chauffeured people carrier			0
she emerged fresh from a @entity84 show , wearing the kind of intense eye shadow that would stop a polar bear in its tracks			0
" yesterday i had a fitting that was very late , " she explains			0
" so i went back home at almost one o'clock			0
and this morning i woke up late ... my call time was seven but i woke up at 7:30			0
just brushed my teeth before rush rush rush			0
so i did n't pick up my make up remover			0
" for a public figure whose image is key , @entity14 remains surprisingly open and accessible			1
she laughs frequently , is impeccably polite and even offers to help us with our camera equipment as we arrive at her agency			0
while the image of a five - foot - ten supermodel carrying a tripod is almost irresistible , @entity1 declines			2
at the stylish @entity104 offices of @entity105 , @entity74 catches up with staff and removes her war paint			1
the agency has managed her since she arrived in @entity0 and is focused on maintaining relations with top - end brands , while exploiting opportunities with appropriate @entity26 firms			1
" she has already achieved historic success as a model , " says agency president @entity113			2
" @entity26 's influence in the fashion world will be tremendous both from a stand point of every @entity120 fashion brand wanting to establish their presence there , as well as @entity26 brands , designers , and models having more of a global impact			1
" @entity74 was brought up in @entity127 and began her modeling career in 2005 after entering a competition , which promised a computer as first prize			1
" i was a very young girl , i think i was 18 , " she recalls			0
" i just wanted to win the computer			0
before i did n't really understand what modeling was because i grew up in a very small town , no fashion			2
" soon , she moved to @entity136 , abandoning her plans to work as a tour guide			0
photo shoots followed , which led to a trip to @entity141 in 2008 , where she was cast for her first runway show for @entity146 fashion label @entity144			2
" i did n't understand anything because i could n't understand @entity148			0
i just listened to the music and followed my feelings			0
" despite the genuinely long days of fashion weeks , her drive is evident			2
@entity74 power naps in the car between appointments , but approaches each casting and show with enthusiasm			1
the one moment of disappointment we witnessed was in a restaurant when her agent suggested she avoided spicy chicken noodles for lunch			0
she greeted the news stoically and ordered regular chicken noodle soup , which she ate up			0
quieter moments like these are fleeting during the whirl of the fashion weeks and soon @entity14 returns to the drumbeat of shows and fittings which go on all afternoon and into the evening			1
at @entity3 the following day , @entity1 leaves her backstage , heading through the main entrance to film the show			0
@entity1 had spent days navigating the complex hierarchy of @entity72 's accreditation and guest lists , often being excluded from both in this rarefied world			1
but this time , @entity1 was appraised by a headset - wearing , clipboard - wielding @entity181 , who muttered to security : " these guys are okay			0
" it was the most ringing endorsement of our lives			0
@entity1 took our place in " @entity189 , " ahead of the deluge of other crews and watched as the room began to fill with socialites , industry movers and shakers and celebrities , like @entity197			0
eventually the hum of low - level gossiping died down , guests took their seats and the runway 's cover was elegantly peeled away			2
the collection had a vague safari theme and @entity14 appeared , transformed again , pounding down the catwalk with a steely faraway glare			1
in a few months , @entity14 will unveil her own line of clothes in collaboration with a @entity26 company and her agency is expecting film offers			1
but she dismisses the idea of herself as an ambassador for @entity26 and any accompanying pressure			1
" it has been an honor to represent my country as a model , but i do n't think i 've ever thought of myself as an ambassador , just someone trying to do her job as best as she can -- so there is n't that much pressure at all ! if what i 've done so far can inspire others in @entity26 , then of course it is a great thing			1

@entity14 is regarded by many in the fashion world as @entity26 's first supermodel
at the age of 23 , she has already worked for most of the world 's major fashion houses
@entity74 is also the first @entity48 model to be named as a spokesperson for @entity50
@entity26 is expected to become a major *market* for global fashion brands in years to come
