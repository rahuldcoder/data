deja vu ? yesterday 's news ? nope , it 's just another series of air dramas involving disruptive @entity6 air travelers			1
it has n't been the most peaceful fortnight in the aviation industry -- we 've seen the aftermath of a @entity14 exec 's " nut rage " and @entity16 singer @entity15 arrested for attempting to force open a closed airplane door after missing the last call for boarding			0
in the midst of this unruly behavior have come no fewer than four inflight dramas involving @entity6 tourists			1
on the heels of a " gim me my cup noodle water ! " meltdown and two emergency exit incidents , a bizarre fight between multiple passengers broke out over a dispute involving a crying baby			1
the poor kid probably just could n't get any sleep with all the fuss going on			0
hot water throw down the fortnight of infamy was highlighted by the cup noodle row heard ' round the world -- or at least across @entity41			1
on december 11 , four tourists threw a series of tantrums on an @entity46 flight from @entity47 to @entity48			1
the episode began during takeoff when , observing safety rules , cabin staff refused to serve hot water to a couple who wanted to immediately get going on their cup noodle			1
the couple retaliated by crushing nuts on the floor			2
the man , @entity61 , was allegedly still fuming when a flight attendant for the budget airline brought him a cup of hot water after the plane reached cruising altitude , then attempted to charge him 60 @entity68 baht ( $ 2 ) for the water			1
" you think i ca n't afford it ? " @entity61 demanded , using the word " laozi , " a pompous way of referring to one 's self as a boss or superior			0
a video captured @entity61 yelling at the attendant			0
as the quarrel dragged on , the man 's girlfriend , @entity79 , threw hot water on the back of the flight attendant			1
@entity68 authorities eventually ordered @entity79 to pay 50,000 baht ( $ 1,500 ) to the flight attendant			1
each passenger involved in the incident was fined amounts between $ 3 and $ 6			0
@entity6 government not amused the @entity90 issued a stern statement after the @entity46 episode , saying it had " severely damaged the overall image of @entity6 people " and demanding local authorities review the case			1
air rage is a common sight in delay - prone @entity6			2
in recent years , state media has reported numerous dramatic incidents involving irate passengers , ranging from blocking moving aircraft on an active runway to fistfights with airport employees			2
during an official visit to the @entity108 in september , president @entity106 personally asked @entity6 tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad			1
last year the government released a lengthy list of do 's and don'ts aimed at turning @entity6 travelers into " civilized tourists			1
" all the warnings and cajoling seem to have fallen on deaf ears , though			0
quickest way off a plane ? emergency exit ! impatient or lacking fresh air or ... something ... @entity6 passengers in separate incidents in the past two weeks decided to deal with their " stuck on a plane " dilemmas in unexpected fashion			1
upon landing in @entity128 on december 8 after a @entity130 flight from @entity131 , a fidgety passenger not content to suffer through the excruciating disembarkation process -- do n't judge ! we 've all been there ! -- went ahead and opened the emergency exit door , engaging the aircraft 's inflatable slide			1
xinhua news agency said the reason for the man 's action was unknown , but the @entity144 website from southern @entity6 reported that the passenger said he simply wanted to depart the plane sooner			2
his solution , to borrow loosely from @entity148 , did display a certain amount of sense , if not sensibility			0
regardless , the shortcut cost the airline $ 16,000 and a two - hour delay , according to @entity155			0
that unauthorized exit was followed by an incident on december 14 during which a first - time flier on a @entity160 flight reportedly felt the urge for some fresh air while waiting for his plane to take off			0
his fix ? open the emergency door for better ventilation			0
the man was n't fined or punished because the act did n't cause any damage , stated the airline			0
baby mama drama calm in the skies reigned for three entire days before being shattered on thursday when a minor brawl broke out on an @entity178 flight from @entity179 to @entity180			2
the imbroglio began when a pair of passengers complained about the crying baby seated behind them			1
the child 's mother , meanwhile , spared no words in expressing her own displeasure with the people in front reclining their seats into her space			2
unable to compromise , the quarrel escalated into a full - on fight			0
a photo in which one woman appears ready to slap another woman -- who herself seems to be floating almost perpendicular to the floor of the aircraft , perhaps readying to deliver an unorthodox blow of her own -- quickly circulated online			0
" a group brawl above 7,500 meters			0
our plane was almost turned around , " wrote a passenger who shared the incident and picture on @entity206 , @entity6 's @entity207			2
the plane was n't diverted , though @entity180 police were called in to keep everyone calm and carrying on once the plane landed			0
meanwhile , no air rage incidents have been reported for 24 hours ... and counting ...			0
