-- @entity1 , one of the bluest states and where president @entity4 won 58.3 % of the vote in november 's presidential election , is poised to re-elect @entity7 , the state 's incumbent @entity8 governor , this fall			1
having been deeply engaged in @entity1 politics since his youth , @entity7 seems to relish his role as one of the nation 's most powerful and prominent governors			0
yet many are wondering whether @entity7 's popularity in the @entity1 has come at the expense of his presidential prospects			1
@entity22 , for example , decided not to run for re-election as governor of @entity25 in the 2006 race , sensing that the steps he 'd need to take to achieve political success in his left - leaning state might doom his prospects with the more conservative national @entity8 primary electorate in 2008			1
@entity7 , in contrast , has spent a great deal of time and energy winning over @entity1 voters who had once dismissed him as a loudmouth ideologue			0
has @entity7 made a serious miscalculation that could doom his prospects for national office ? or is he savvier than his critics understand ? a year ago , conservative activists were enthralled with @entity7 , who had gained a national following for his quick wit and his combativeness in taking on his state 's powerful public employee unions			2
even after the @entity8 primaries were underway , a number of @entity8 stalwarts hoped that @entity7 would jump into the presidential race , despite that he was still in his first term as governor			1
part of @entity7 's appeal was that as the hard - charging @entity8 chief executive of an overwhelmingly @entity67 @entity66 state , he had the potential to scramble the electoral map			1
while the @entity8 fares well in rural areas and in the suburbs of the @entity73 and the @entity74 , the party has taken a beating in the big cities and suburbs of the coasts ever since the rise of @entity81			0
@entity7 's common - sense conservatism , however , had managed to win over skeptical voters in one of the country 's densest and most diverse states			1
but in recent months , @entity7 has lost some of his luster on the right			0
his keynote address at the @entity92 was widely viewed as a disappointment , with many suggesting that it had focused too much on @entity7 's biography and accomplishments rather than the virtues of the @entity99 ticket			2
and in the wake of @entity102 , which devastated large stretches of @entity1 's coastline , the governor was fulsome in his praise of @entity4 's response , giving the embattled incumbent a crucial boost in the days before the election			0
most recently , @entity7 excoriated house speaker @entity111 and congressional @entity8 for having failed to vote on a @entity102 relief bill that promised tens of billions of dollars in aid to his beleaguered constituents			2
@entity7 's crossing of party lines has struck at least some of his erstwhile conservative admirers as disloyal in the extreme			2
@entity119 : @entity7 drops bomb on @entity8 leaders at the same time , @entity7 's decisions to distance himself from the @entity124 @entity8 and to stand shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity4 have greatly strengthened his reputation in @entity1 , where his approval rating hit 77 % late last year according to a @entity129 survey			1
after having been one of the state 's most polarizing political figures , @entity7 has been embraced by a growing number of @entity67 , many of whom have come to see him as a bipartisan problem - solver			2
indeed , @entity7 's political standing reportedly helped convince @entity139 , the popular mayor of @entity141 's most populous city , to abandon his plans of running for governor in 2013			1
louis : @entity8 civil war over @entity102 disaster relief assuming @entity7 wins re-election this year , which is far from a foregone conclusion , he has one powerful asset going forward in national politics : the @entity8 brand has suffered a great deal in recent years			1
in a survey conducted by the firm @entity155 , voters were asked to compare @entity67 and @entity8 across a number of brand attributes			0
an overwhelming majority of respondents chose the @entity67 as the party that " cares about people like me , " " offers a hopeful vision " and " focuses on issues that matter to me			0
" if a @entity8 presidential candidate is going to win in 2016 , she or he will have to overcome this deficit			0
leading republicans such as sen. @entity171 of @entity172 and gov. @entity173 of @entity174 have made an effort to talk about issues of interest to middle - income voters , an area in which @entity8 have been sorely lacking			0
yet @entity7 's willingness to distance himself from congressional @entity8 gives him added credibility in selling himself as " a different kind of @entity8 , " and it is reminiscent of the strategy pursued by then - @entity189 gov. @entity188 , who was sharply critical of congressional @entity8 for their willingness to cut anti-poverty programs			1
it is not obvious that a " kinder , gentler " @entity194 will fare well in the primary process come 2016 , but it is a shrewd way to differentiate oneself from a primary field in which most challengers will be competing to demonstrate their conservative bona fides. and more to the point , a @entity8 nominee who manages to convey a softer , most centrist image will have a much easier time winning the next general election			0
that could be @entity7 's long game			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0
