@entity0 -- the owner of one farm at the center of a massive egg recall apologized to anyone who may have been sickened by his product wednesday , while another refused to answer questions about conditions at his operation			1
@entity12 , president of @entity14 of @entity15 , invoked his @entity16 right against self - incrimination when asked whether he knew about unsanitary conditions at one of his farms before an august e-mail from a production manager			1
@entity12 was appearing before a @entity24 subcommittee investigating the outbreak of salmonella enteritidis that sickened more than 1,600 people and triggered the recall of more than half a billion eggs			1
@entity30 , @entity14 production representative , told the committee that the recall has forced his firm " to take a hard look at our operations			2
" " and even if the source of the salmonella illness is never confirmed , where we have fallen short in @entity15 , we are committed to improving our operations , " @entity30 said			1
he said @entity40 has cut its marketing relationship with another @entity43 - owned farm " because we were disappointed with the test results there			1
" meanwhile , the owner of the other agribusiness firm involved in the recall said he was " horrified " that eggs from his company may have sickened anyone			1
" we apologize to everyone who may have been sickened by eating our eggs			2
i pray several times each day for all of them and for their improved health , " @entity43 , the owner of @entity54 , told the @entity56 subcommittee			1
@entity43 -- whose chicken and hog farms have been repeatedly cited by state regulators in the @entity63 and @entity64 -- said his company 's compliance with food safety regulation suffered as it grew , and " i am sorry for those failings			1
" " i accept responsibility for those mistakes in our operations , " he told the committee			0
and @entity43 's son @entity75 , @entity54 's chief operating officer , told the subcommittee that " while we always believed we were doing the right thing , it is now very clear that we must do more			1
" but the @entity79 faced sharp questions throughout the hearing from lawmakers , including the chairman of the full committee , rep. @entity83			1
@entity85 occurs naturally in chickens , but @entity88 inspectors reported in august that neither @entity89 nor @entity40 fully followed their plans to prevent @entity26 , the strain behind the outbreak			1
federal investigators reported finding salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at the farms , as well as rodents , heaping piles of manure , dead animals and uncaged birds and flies too numerous to count			1
" it 's hard for me to reconcile your words , that you wanted to clean up and you did clean up the facility , with the record before the committee , " said @entity83 , @entity103			0
" the conditions in your facility were not clean			2
" but the committee 's ranking @entity114 , @entity117 rep. @entity116 , also questioned why @entity119 inspectors failed to report conditions at @entity54 to the @entity88			1
" if you know this is a high - risk food and a high - risk practice -- and the @entity124 kind of have a history -- why would n't someone say something ? " @entity116 asked dr. @entity128 , the @entity88 's principal deputy commissioner			0
@entity116 suggested the outbreak could have been averted " if one federal agency had used common sense and talked to another feeral agency			0
" @entity128 said the @entity88 and the @entity119 , which regulate different aspects of the industry , " are working on improving communication			0
" but he said new regulations on egg producers and a food - safety bill pending in the @entity141 " would allow us to make those inspections as effective as possible			0
" at the outset of the hearing , @entity83 said the @entity43 family has had " warning after warning " about conditions at its operations for decades			1
despite those warnings , @entity43 family companies " continue to raise chickens in slovenly conditions and make millions of dollars by selling contaminated eggs , " he said			2
and @entity43 's remarks were briefly interrupted by a protester the @entity156 , a group critical of industrialized agriculture			0
the man carried a banner that proclaimed , " recall all egg production			0
" " @entity43 and his cohorts are a mere piece of a larger picture , " the man said before being escorted from the hearing room			2
there were fireworks among members of the committee as well , as its ranking @entity114 tried to rebut @entity174 ' criticism of @entity176 @entity175 sen. @entity175 , who is fighting new food safety legislation supporters say could have prevented the outbreak			0
at one point , subcommittee chairman @entity179 , d - @entity181 , cut off @entity116 's microphone when he tried to read a statement blaming the @entity141 's @entity174 leadership for stalling the bill			0
@entity116 later accused @entity179 of " censorship			0
" @entity179 said @entity116 -- who supported the legislation -- tried to " back - door " a statement from @entity176 sen. @entity175 into the record after his time had expired and without the consent of the committee			0
one of those sickened in this summer 's outbreak was @entity197 , who told the subcommittee she ended up in an intensive - care unit after eating a custard tart at a party for her sister 's college graduation			0
her sister also fell ill. she said she still suffers from severe abdominal cramps , diarrhea and fevers and has to take between five to 10 drugs a day			2
" i lost 30 pounds , " she said			0
" my sick joke is , ' you can cure my salmonella in 30 more pounds , ' you know what i mean ? but it 's not funny			2
