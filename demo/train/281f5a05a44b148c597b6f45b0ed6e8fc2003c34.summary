when racial conflict flared in @entity2 , @entity3 , this summer it brought back terrible memories of what happened nearly 50 years ago , in the summer of 1965			1
then , with a @entity7 administration riding high on a string of major legislative victories , including landmark civil rights and voting rights legislation , six days of horrendous rioting broke out in @entity13 , @entity14 following community frustration with police brutality			1
as the nation celebrates the birthday of civil rights leader @entity20 , it is a good time to look back at some of his unfulfilled agenda from the late 1960s , when he had turned his attention to issues directly related to the riots , such as fair housing , unemployment and the infrastructure of the cities			1
the rioting in @entity13 devastated the community			1
the conflict began on august 11 following a traffic stop in the @entity36 neighborhood			1
the police pulled over the car of 21 - year - old @entity39 and his brother in the early evening			2
the police believed that @entity43 was intoxicated			2
@entity43 's mother arrived on the scene and started to yell at the police to leave her son alone			2
in @entity13 , many community residents did n't trust the police			1
charges of police brutality had been commonplace for decades			2
when the policeman arrested the brother and their mother , an angry crowd started to throw bottles and rocks at the police			2
rumors circulated that the police had hit a pregnant woman			2
the rioting quickly spread through a 25 - block area			0
one five - year - old boy was killed by sniper fire			0
president @entity67 , who had been riding high from a wave of legislative victories , could n't believe what he was hearing was taking place in @entity13			1
his response shifted from anger to frustration to a determination to fix the problem			0
at times , @entity67 showed his worst side by privately castigating the @entity36 as irresponsible children who did n't appreciate what he had done for them and who were ruining everything that he had helped to achieve			1
during a conversation with @entity84 , the new president of the @entity85 , on august 14 , @entity67 said they had " hell in @entity14 " and that @entity36 needed to learn they had " obligations as well as rights			1
we fought like a devil to get them their rights and we 're going to continue to			0
and we want them to be responsible now			0
" the riots continued for six days with 34 people killed and hundreds injured			2
the @entity97 helped restore order			0
more than 3,000 people were arrested			0
the buildings and businesses in the area were devastated			0
overseas , the @entity104 blasted out images of the rioting to use as propaganda in an effort to show that racial violence was commonplace in this allegedly " democratic " country			0
as @entity67 's anger simmered when the riots cooled down , he spoke much more about the deeper economic problems that he believed were fueling the anger in communities like @entity13			1
@entity67 had been moved by a report from @entity118 that traced the breakdown of the @entity36 family after years of discrimination and hardship			1
on august 18 , @entity67 told former cia director @entity123 that these " groups they got really absolutely nothing to live for			1
forty percent of them are unemployed			0
these youngsters , they live with rats and they 've got no place to sleep			0
broken homes and illegitimate families and all the narcotics are circulating around them ...			0
and we 've isolated them , and they 're all in one area , when they move in why we move out			0
" the riots caused tension with civil rights leaders , who were eager for @entity67 to deal more aggressively with issues like police brutality and economic despair			1
on august 20 , @entity67 told @entity20 that he was telling everyone the government needed to " correct these conditions , " like housing and unemployment			1
he complained to @entity67 that the mayor of @entity14 was " absolutely insensitive to the problems and to the needs to really cure the situation			1
" @entity20 said the mayor and police leaders were unwilling to make any concessions			0
@entity20 feared that if there was more rioting there would be violent retaliation from white people			0
" so that i 'm fearful that if something is n't done to give a new sense of hope to the people in that area -- and they are poverty stricken -- that a full - scale race war can develop here ...			0
" @entity20 wanted @entity67 to propose a robust poverty program for the area			1
@entity67 said he fully supported such a strategy			1
the president said that they needed to get young @entity36 jobs and homes			0
he said that " i 've spent the biggest part of my life the last four years on civil rights bills , but it does n't , all of it comes to naught if you have a situation like war in the world or a situation in @entity14			1
" @entity67 said that " there 's no use giving lectures on the law as long as you 've got rats eating on people 's children and unemployed and no roof over their head and no job to go to and maybe with a dope needle in one hand and the cancer in the other ! " but , the president went on to say , there was n't much political support for doing anything substantial			1
indeed , the @entity210 was already giving him a tough time on simply providing funding for his @entity213			0
" i 'm having hell up here with this @entity216 , " @entity67 said			1
in the end , the riots did not result in any major changes in policy			2
the only major outcome following two more riots in 1967 ( in @entity221 and @entity222 ) would be an independent commission , chaired by former @entity227 gov. @entity226 , that investigated the causes of the rioting			2
the @entity230 issued its landmark report in 1968 , concluding : " our nation is moving toward two societies , one black , one white -- separate and unequal			0
" but @entity216 never provided any substantial boost in funds to deal with these sorts of problems			2
the riots came right as @entity67 's political strength in @entity216 started to diminish			1
he did n't believe he could ask for money to do something about it			0
ever since then , the situation in too many inner - city areas has remained grim even as neighborhoods around them boom with gentrification			0
good jobs continued to be elusive			0
policing remains a problem as does the narcotics trade			0
families continue to suffer and educational opportunities have vanished			0
the nation has never dealt with the problems that afflicted @entity13			1
the riots took place just as @entity67 's political power was staring to ebb and the white backlash against more racial reform was setting in			1
the inability to save the inner cities was one of the great failures of liberal reform in the past century , one that continues to haunt the nation			2

deadly riots erupted in an @entity14 neighborhood in 1965 , just as @entity67 's power was waning
@entity274 says @entity275 never came to grips with problems that afflicted @entity13 , other inner cities
