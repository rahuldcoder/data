it 's an idea that 's radical in its simplicity			0
@entity3 voters on november 24 will consider capping executive pay at 12 times what the lowest - paid worker at a company makes -- the premise being that a ceo should make no more in a month than a low - level employee earns in a year			1
the referendum , which is called the " 1:12 initiative " and began after supporters gathered 100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot , is the kind of elegant solution to income inequality that we in the @entity22 should consider more seriously			1
not because the initiative , as it will be voted on , would work in the @entity22			2
but because the idea of tethering top executive pay to some sort of concrete metric might stop @entity22 execs from floating further into the stratosphere			1
related : the most unequal place in @entity22 here in @entity22 , the land of unequal opportunity , the @entity32 of top - 500 companies make in a single day about what it takes an average " rank - and - file " worker a year to earn , according to the @entity39 , the federation of unions			1
@entity3 has an average ceo - to - worker compensation ratio of 148 to 1 , the group says			1
the average @entity22 rate is 354 to 1 , according to the @entity39			2
others put the ratio somewhat lower , around 273 to 1 in 2012			2
either way , it 's bad			0
and some @entity22 companies are worse , still			2
@entity49 has the highest ratio -- 1,795:1 -- on a list of 250 businesses compiled by @entity53			0
that department store 's ceo got $ 53.3 million in pay and benefits in 2012 , @entity53 says			2
workers , by comparison , earned only about $ 30,000 a year			0
so , like , whatever , right ? what 's @entity61 up to ? it 's tempting to excuse sky - high exec pay as either necessary ( to attract top " talent " and because these inequality - era celebs are thought to increase the value of the companies where they exercise said talents ) or inconsequential			1
the @entity3 vote , for example , does nothing to increase average worker pay			1
it aims solely to clip cash from the very top of the economic ladder			0
but the pay ratio does matter , for a couple of common - sense reasons			1
one is that democracy starts to unravel if a few people become wildly , ethereally successful , while the rest of a country struggles			0
that was the best argument i heard on a recent phone call with @entity88 , a @entity3 politician who has been one of the earliest proponents of the 1:12 initiative			2
@entity88 is not arguing for the enforced pay ratio on practical or economic grounds			1
his is a moral position -- that it is fundamentally unfair for the pay gap to be so wide , and that it allows a few uber - rich people to wield undo influence over society , economics and politics			2
" there is a certain threat to democracy , " he told me			0
related : is income inequality ' morally wrong ' ? @entity88 does n't expect the 1:12 initiative to pass , but it does have about 35 % to 40 % support in recent polls , he told me , which is fairly staggering , and indicates people are fed up			1
another argument against sky - high ceo pay is that it 's unnecessary			1
@entity117 , a distinguished professor of corporate and business law at @entity119 , told me ceo pay has been rising for decades and that the @entity22 is , in effect , subsidizing the trend with " unlimited tax deductions " on certain forms of pay			1
" i 'm a big fan of capitalism , " she said			0
" i love corporations and i love the business world and i think it 's done more for peace and prosperity than people may realize			0
but there are structural reasons to think that executive pay and ceo pay are out of whack			1
" a $ 1 million salary worked for @entity22 ceos from the 1930s to 1980s , she said			2
ceo pay , including options realized that year , jumped about 875 % , to $ 14.1 million , from 1978 to 2012 , according to the @entity141			1
that increase , which is calcuated using 2012 dollars , according to @entity141 , is " more than double stock market growth and substantially greater than the painfully slow 5.4 % growth in a typical worker 's compensation over the same period			0
" a 5 % increase at the bottom versus 875 % at the top			0
that 's the same , right ? " what we 've got is basically an arms race , " @entity117 said , " where the @entity32 are competing on pay because they each want to have higher status than the others			0
" related : should we vilify the rich ? finally , all of this is bad business			0
@entity161 , who is recognized as the father of business management , famously said the ceo - to - worker salary ratio should not exceed 20:1 , which is what existed in the @entity22 in 1965 , according to the @entity141			1
beyond that , managers will see an increase in " resentment and falling morale , " @entity161 once wrote , according to a blog post by @entity172			0
that resentment is behind both the @entity174 and the @entity3 vote			1
so the question to me is not if we should do something about outlandish executive pay , but what , exactly			1
the 1:12 ratio would be unlikely to gain any traction in the @entity22 , said @entity184 , principal at @entity185 , a company that does consulting on executive pay issues			1
he called the measure , which , according to @entity88 , includes stock options and other non-salary forms of pay , " potentially draconian " and said most ratios between ceo and worker pay he hears discussed deal with three - digit numbers			1
twelve is a shock , i 'll agree , and it 's probably too extreme for the @entity22			2
it 's clear , however , that the ways @entity22 has been trying to curb executive pay are not working -- perhaps because they 're too convoluted and lack teeth			1
shareholders get to vote on executive pay in the @entity22 , for example , but their decisions are n't binding			1
loopholes let @entity32 dodge taxes on their income			0
and the @entity210 currently is asking for public comment on a proposal that would require companies to disclose the ratio of their ceo 's pay to the median income of workers			1
( tell them what you think of that here )			0
but , according to some news reports , the metrics are so loosey - goosey it will be difficult to compare one company to another			0
that 's still just a disclosure			0
maybe we need an enforceable ratio			0
the best idea i 've heard comes from @entity117 , the @entity119 professor			0
she has suggested making ceo pay non-deductible when it 's higher than 100 times the minimum wage			2
i might take it one step further : perhaps the @entity22 should cap ceo pay at 100 times the minimum wage , combining @entity117 's idea with the @entity3 proposal			1
it 's just an idea , and it should be vetted by economists and the public			0
but , to me , that 's the point			0
these are concepts that should be on the table in the @entity22			2
it 's ridiculous that @entity210 attempts to make ceo pay ratios transparent are controversial in the business community			2
the conversation needs to move forward			0
limiting ceo pay to 100 times the minimum wage would still allow top execs to be millionaires -- they 'd earn a maximum wage of about $ 1.5 million per year , given the current federal minimum of $ 7.25 an hour , figured for a 40 - hour work week			1
and here 's the best part : if the fat cats wanted a pay increase , maybe the best way for them to get it would be to throw political weight behind a campaign to boost the minimum wage			0
that 's a reform simple enough to make a difference .			0

@entity3 will vote on a 1:12 executive - to - worker pay ratio
@entity272 : the @entity22 should consider a similar proposal
he says such a ratio could curb income inequality and sky - high ceo pay
@entity272 : executive pay *skyrocketed* over decades while worker pay *stagnated*
