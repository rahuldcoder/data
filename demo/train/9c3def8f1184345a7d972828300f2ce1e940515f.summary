-- @entity1 is not a death sentence			1
that is the lesson to the world from the release this week of dr. @entity6 from a hospital in @entity8			1
less than three weeks ago , @entity6 was diagnosed with @entity1 and admitted to @entity9 in @entity8			1
on tuesday , he walked out , free of the virus			2
@entity6 had been treating @entity1 patients in @entity12			1
he knew he was risking his life			0
but he also knew that , given proper care , people can survive this disease			0
indeed , eight of the nine people treated for @entity1 in the @entity19 have returned home safely to their families			1
that 's the good news : health care can make a difference			0
in , @entity26 , however , too many @entity1 patients are dying from the disease , nearly 5,000 from the about 13,500 cases that have been reported			1
yet we can dramatically reduce this rate and ensure the disease is not spread			0
the strategy for containing and ending the outbreak in @entity26 , and for preventing worldwide spread , requires an army of courageous health care workers and community volunteers like @entity6 to join those from within the affected countries , those who already are making a difference on the @entity1 front lines throughout @entity12 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
when @entity6 was admitted to @entity9 , the situation in these countries looked bleak			1
today , there are reasons for optimism that the @entity1 outbreak can and will be brought under control			1
while transmission continues to outpace the response , we are also seeing that , where people receive care , and where communities embrace safe burial and other practices that reduce infection , the rate of transmission may be slowing			0
as a result , we are potentially seeing the curve bending -- not everywhere , but in enough places to give us reason for hope			0
over the past several weeks the international community across @entity26 and around the world has mobilized to provide assistance			1
from governments and aid organizations to foundations and the private sector , the world 's leaders are stepping up			0
but much more is needed , especially medical personnel to work in @entity1 treatment units and others to train @entity79 who are volunteering to work in their own communities			2
several governments and nongovernmental organizations from @entity26 and around the world have stepped up to provide skilled health care workers , but many more will need to join them to complete the task			2
the @entity88 , coordinated by the @entity89 , has a clear strategy : by december 1 , isolating and treating 70 % of all @entity1 cases and providing safe and dignified burials to 70 % of those who have died			1
by the end of the year , we aim to establish ebola - free zones			0
the next goal will be zero cases of @entity1 in @entity26 and everywhere			1
that is the only way to avoid a resurgence and prevent @entity1 from spreading across borders			2
we will also need to provide sustained support to the affected countries			0
the outbreak has had a significant impact on health care , with people unable or afraid to access essential services such as maternal care , measles vaccinations and treatment for malaria			2
many schools are closed , food prices have risen by nearly 25 % and trade has suffered			0
we must work to ensure such an outbreak never happens again			0
that means investing in infrastructure , education and public health in developing countries , learning the lessons of @entity1 and making sure communities are less susceptible and that global early warning and response systems for outbreaks are more robust			2
we must prepare for the worst so it never happens			0
@entity1 has caused inestimable suffering and havoc in @entity26			1
but the story of dr. @entity6 and the others who have been cured with adequate health care is that @entity1 can be beaten			1
let us celebrate the health care heroes in @entity26 and show global solidarity so the people of @entity12 , @entity42 and @entity43 can return to the path of progress that they were on before the @entity1 crisis			1
thank you , dr @entity6 , for the care you gave			2
thanks to those who have cared for you			0
and thanks to those who have cared for the thousands of others who have recovered			0
thanks for what you have given and continue to give			0
we owe you all so much .			0
