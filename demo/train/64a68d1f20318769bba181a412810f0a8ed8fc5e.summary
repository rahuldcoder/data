@entity0 -- " @entity2 , " a new group of female fans loyal to @entity6 's prime minister , is calling upon all " young , smart and beautiful " women in the country who ardently support @entity9 to produce amateur video clips that show how far they would go to express their affection for him			1
the community , which was launched in @entity6 's popular social networking sites vkontakte and @entity15 , claims to have united some 800 followers behind the idea of @entity9 running in the march 2012 presidential election			1
it is not clear who exactly is behind this initiative , but the first video posted features a glamorous blonde who describes herself as student named @entity25			0
" i 'm crazy about the person who has changed our country			0
he is a prominent politician and an awesome man			0
millions of people adore and trust him , " @entity25 says in the narrative accompanying the video			0
" we are launching a contest with very simple rules			0

@entity9 -- who already served two terms as the country 's president from 2000 to 2008 -- has not announced yet whether he or his protege , incumbent @entity56 , would run for the top office post again next year			1
on numerous occasions in the past few years , both @entity9 and @entity56 said they would sit down together and decide that soon			1
in the video sequence , which features club music in the background , @entity25 walks along @entity0 streets in high heels and a black suit			0
