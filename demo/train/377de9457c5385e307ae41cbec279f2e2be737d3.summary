@entity0 would n't consider himself a car aficionado , but his car was a part of him : he lived with a turn signal stuck lever in his arm for 51 years			1
he was driving his tan @entity10 to work one morning in july 1963 when he crashed , an accident so bad that the local radio station reported it as a fatality , he said			2
@entity0 , 75 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , recalls the accident as a series of unfortunate incidents			1
it had been raining , and the road was slick with oil			0
@entity0 had tried to have his tires replaced the day before but could n't get an appointment			1
to top it off , one curve along his route was prone to puddling -- and that 's where calamity struck			0
" after i hit the puddles , i hydroplaned , and i saw the semi truck coming , so i gunned it so i would n't hit the semi truck , so that i would make it to the far side of the road , but i did n't make it that far , and i had a head - on collision with the truck , " @entity0 said			1
he survived the collision with a broken hip and four or five broken ribs			0
he says he lay in traction for 10 days before surgeons could operate			0
" they wanted me to get past the shock and to make sure i would live			0
every time i would breathe , you could hear the click - click of my ribs , " @entity0 said			1
" i had a lot of broken glass that hit me , but i never knew there was anything in my arm			0
" @entity0 says that 35 years after the crash , he went through a metal detector at a courthouse wearing a short - sleeved shirt			1
" my bare arm set the detector off , and it raised the question of what was in my arm , " @entity0 said			1
" i got an x-ray , and it indicated there might have been some kind of tool left in there at the time of the accident			0
but i thought it was peculiar that ( doctors ) thought it was a tool but did n't know what kind of tool , and they told me if it 's not bothering you , leave it alone			2
" so he did , for another 16 years			0
six weeks ago , the lever started to push its way out of his skin			1
" i happened to need to move a couple of concrete blocks , and i picked one of them up with my left hand and moved it 20 feet or so and set it down and carried another one , and that was enough to jolt it loose , and it started protruding through my arm			1
" his surgeon " suggested it might be a piece of the automobile			0
and so i dug up pictures , and we got a picture of the undamaged car with the steering column , and it showed what the turn signal looked like			0
and it compared to what i remember the rod in my arm looking like on the x-ray , and i compared it to the pictures of the accident where there was nothing there , and i concluded that 's what it was			2
" the doctor said i probably had a reflex reaction in the accident where i lifted my hands to save my eyes , and that 's how ( the lever ) went into my arm			1
" the outpatient operation to remove the lever took about 45 minutes on december 31			2
@entity0 thinks he will give the piece to his doctor			2
" my original plan was to make it a keychain , but it has been so corroded having been in my body for 51 years , so i may give it back to the doctor			0
he expressed interest in it , and i thought i would let him add it to his collection , " @entity0 said .			2
