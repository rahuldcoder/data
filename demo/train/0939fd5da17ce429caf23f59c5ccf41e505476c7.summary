-- if masculinity could take the form of a 2 - inch frosted cupcake , @entity1 would have the recipe			1
his @entity7 cupcake company , @entity6 , is an anomaly in a world seemingly dominated by all things dainty and cute			1
@entity1 refuses to serve the " frilly , pink - frosted , sprinkles - and - unicorns " variety			1
instead , customers can proclaim their machismo with cakes made with beer , whiskey , bacon and crushed pretzels			1
" it was born out of necessity and a love of buttercream , " @entity1 said of his 9 - month - old business			1
each @entity26 cupcake sits under a generous layer of frosting and a chocolate disc with a camouflage , wood grain , plaid , houndstooth or other " manly " pattern			1
like a mixed - martial arts fight , @entity1 's cupcakes can pack a serious punch			1
six of his 12 varieties feature alcohol -- and customers feel the hit			2
" the ones with alcohol are actually pretty potent , " said @entity43 , who ordered @entity44 as a joke for the men and women in his advertising agency			2
" the first one i tried ... it had wood grain on it			0
it definitely had whiskey in it , " @entity43 said			0
" i think we all got a buzz from these -- it was pretty strong ! " but can whiskey - infused cupcakes disguised in camo really transform cupcakes into macho fare ? " i think if you try them , you would n't have to ask , " @entity43 said			0
@entity1 said he does n't think the average man would necessarily turn down a pastel , ladylike cupcake			1
" men like to eat , " he said			0
" i 'm not saying i 'm not going to go for a cupcake with a peony on it			0
" but , if given the option , " a guy is going to go for the one that has camo or plaid on it			0
" the flour - and - frosting world seems a far cry from @entity82 , home to a major law firm where @entity1 worked as an asset - backed securities attorney			1
but like many in 2007 and 2008 , @entity1 's career caved unexpectedly			1
" i was laid off			2
i did n't know what i was going to do , " he said			0
" i 'm 40 years old , i have student loans out the wazoo			0
what am i going to do ? " as @entity1 looked around the streets of @entity7 and mulled his options , he marveled how the city 's vast array of bakeries and cupcake shops kept growing and making money during a recession			1
but all the cupcakes seemed too cookie - cutter			0
" there 's been a vacancy in the market with marketing toward men , " he noticed			0
that 's when the epiphany hit			0
@entity1 liquidated his 401 ( k ) and gambled $ 25,000 on the macho bakery of his dreams			1
@entity6 went from selling 40 cupcakes a week to 400 cupcakes a week -- all without a storefront			1
the bakery operates out of a commercial kitchen shared with other businesses and sells its manly confections online			0
while most cupcakes are , stereotypically , feminine or frilly , @entity1 is keenly aware that he himself is playing on stereotypes with his use of bacon , beer and in - your - face manly advertising			1
" it 's so tongue - in - cheek , " @entity1 said			1
ironically , 95 percent of @entity6 's customers are women			1
@entity1 said many are searching for creative gifts after exhausting cliche ideas such as neckties			1
@entity1 has received order requests from around the world , including from troops in @entity136 and @entity137			2
@entity138 tried to place an order for her husband , who is stationed in @entity141			0
@entity138 said the @entity26 baked goods would be the perfect pick - me - up for soldiers overseas			2
" the stuff we send them , it means a lot to them , " @entity138 said			0
" we can send them care packages and everything , but something like that is so much more special because it 's so unique			0
we ca n't do the flavorings like rum and coke			0
we ca n't figure out how to make them taste like rum and coke			0
" @entity6 delivers to @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , but does not ship out - of - state			2
@entity1 said his growth is limited by storage and oven space , but he hopes to start shipping orders outside @entity7 by the end of this year			2
@entity1 does n't have a target date for setting up a storefront			2
but @entity43 , a loyal fan of the " tailgate " cupcake , says he can already forecast the entrepreneur 's future : " i think he would see a line of big , hairy men waiting in line for cupcakes			0

@entity6 features flavors such as *mojito* , beer run and *jackhammer*
