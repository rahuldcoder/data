@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and his family jammed 150,000 sheets of paper , dollar bills , dvds and tiny am / @entity10 radios inside bags attached to giant inflatable helium balloons			1
they launched them into the sky where they floated 200 km ( 124 miles ) across the border to @entity18			1
the message : @entity20 is lying to you			0
renewed worldwide pressure on @entity23 has given urgency to @entity18 defectors living in @entity0 who hope to reach @entity18			1
the balloons are the weapons in breaking @entity20 's spell , say the @entity29			2
the group , made up primarily of @entity18 defectors , says if @entity18 ca n't get any messages from the outside world , then outside world must deliver those messages in			1
how ? the giant helium balloons carrying the garbage bags of propaganda , which can fly 200 kilometers over the border , straight into the heart of @entity23			1
it 's the heart of @entity20 's regime that these defectors hope to strike , by destroying the illusion it has built for its citizens			2
" my brothers are still living there , " said @entity47 , who defected to @entity18 a decade ago			1
" i will be happy if they can come after reading these messages			0
@entity18 know nothing about @entity20 except for his power as general and chief of the country			1
we want them to know the truth			0
" in @entity18 , all public discourse , from media to education , is controlled by the military regime			1
a little radio , says @entity18 defector @entity3 , is a big weapon			1
" i 'm sending this off with the hope of reaching my people , who i left behind , " said @entity3 , as he watched the balloons lift into the sky heading northward			2
" if they get these , i hope they will be able to reflect on the true meaning of freedom			0
the two @entity74 halted decades of propaganda warfare under a 2004 reconciliation deal			2
but ties have soured in the wake of the sinking of the @entity1 warship , the @entity81 , last march			0
it 's reinvigorated the propaganda war among @entity18 defectors in the south			1
@entity86 runs @entity87 , broadcasting from the third floor of a small office building in the outskirts of @entity0			0
he may be in @entity1 , but the audience , he hopes , is @entity18 's citizens , listening from illegal radios			1
@entity20 , who fled @entity18 a decade ago , says the @entity81 warship sinking should show the international community that negotiations with @entity23 will never work , and it must try to reach the @entity18 directly			1
it worked for me , said @entity20 , who recalls how he heard a story on an illegal radio in @entity18			1
" listening to the stories , i thought maybe this is propaganda from the south , " he said			2
the important part , he said , is that he began to question the unquestionable military regime			0
just the question led to him fleeing the @entity18			1
" i want to see it for myself , " he said , referring to the free world			0
while the propaganda war is heating up , people in @entity0 say the prospect of an actual war feels remote			2
@entity1 , long used to the heated battle and rhetoric between the nations , are going about their normal lives			0
" i do n't think war will take place , " said @entity117 , as she shopped with her son in a busy market in downtown @entity0			0
" although the @entity81 incident is serious , the country will be safe because we have strong ties with our allies			0
the north would never invade us			0
" @entity130 @entity129 , who has lived in @entity0 for three years , said she does n't feel any sense of danger			0
" it does not feel like war			0
the feeling i get from the @entity18 people here , it 's very easygoing and they go on with their life and i do too			2
