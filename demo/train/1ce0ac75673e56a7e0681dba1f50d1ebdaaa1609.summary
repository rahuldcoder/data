-- whenever someone has lived a solid and productive life , the pastor at his or her funeral may turn to @entity5 to offer a few words the good lord may utter as the person 's spirit ascends to heaven : " well done , good and faithful servant ! " in the pantheon of civil rights organizations , the @entity14 stands tall as one of the greatest groups ever to advance the cause of civil rights , helping bring the hatred and bigotry of @entity21 to its knees			1
from its marches and protests to its negotiations with political and business leaders and its efficient work with other civil rights groups , the @entity14 's work has been legendary			1
yet 55 years after its co-founding by the rev. dr. @entity32 , it is an organization that makes headlines today more for infighting among members and the revolving door that its top leadership positions have become -- all while crucial social justice issues continue to fester for african - americans and others			1
whether we want to admit it or not , the @entity14 has been devoid of a @entity44 spirit for a long time			2
it is leading nothing and doing nothing			0
the fact that i 'm writing these words may be painful to civil rights stalwarts ( and @entity52 fraternity brothers of mine ) like longtime activists the rev. @entity55 and the rev. @entity56 , but sometimes the truth hurts			1
on monday , the @entity14 is set to announce that former ceo @entity58 is returning to helm the organization he served as president from 2004 to 2009			1
in the four years since he left , the @entity14 has gone through four leaders , including the rev. @entity63 , who , in a strange debacle , was chosen as ceo in 2010 , but never assumed the post after a conflict with the board			1
her cousin @entity68 , a nephew of dr. @entity32 , was chosen to lead the group about a year ago , but he was replaced			0
in the past several years we have seen split factions among the board , leading to competing board meetings ; the doors to the headquarters being chained to keep others out ; even arguments at board meetings where some members nearly came to blows			2
this is nothing but drama , mess , childish antics or whatever you want to call it			0
it is a severe stain on the life and legacy of @entity32 and the many others who stood with him during the darkest hours			0
when your group is known more for fighting among its leaders than fighting racism , sexism and inequality , you serve no real purpose			0
one of @entity58 's accomplishments when he took over the first time was building the organization a national headquarters that the group owned			2
he did so , debt - free -- but who cares about a building when an organization has no mission and no relevance ? who really cares if the organization 's leaders proclaim a desire to be solvent when the @entity14 has lost its soul ? i 've meet @entity58 and we 've had many discussions			1
he 's an honorable man			0
but the issue here is n't who is the leader			0
instead , it 's a group of people on the board of directors who are n't leading the group anywhere but further into the grave			1
i 'll be perfectly honest : the @entity14 has been persona non grata on the media platforms i have that reach millions of african - americans			2
booking someone from the group on my sunday morning news show on a black cable network , @entity135 , or my daily news segment on the @entity137 , a syndicated radio show with a huge black audience , would be a waste of time			0
why am i going to waste valuable time advancing the latest initiative from the @entity14 when it 's likely to go nowhere due to constant infighting ? the list of issues the @entity14 could be addressing is vast , from the scourge of inner - city violence that continues to take away another generation of black kids , to a high school dropout rate that is shameful			1
if the @entity14 wants to get back to basics and play a crucial role in the 21st century , @entity58 is going to have to rid the group of the spirit of dissension that is running through its veins			1
he is going to have to show a new generation of pastors across the country that aligning with the @entity14 has value other than raising their blood pressure			2
as a @entity44 , i desire the best outcome for the @entity14			2
but frankly , i have no faith that the organization has put its past drama behind it			0
. and until it can prove to me and others that it wants to be taken seriously , the @entity14 will be just like the @entity170 or the now - defunct @entity171 -- groups that had their glory days during a different era , and saw them end			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

@entity178 : @entity14 a *towering* civil rights group
but , he says , it 's been riven by infighting in recent years that has hurt its ability to do its work
he says *incoming* ceo is promising , but *squabbling* board of directors *detracts*
@entity178 : if new ceo wants @entity14 to *regain* relevance , he must quell drama , move forward
