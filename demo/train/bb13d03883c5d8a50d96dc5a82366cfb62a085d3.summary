@entity0 -- @entity4 will miss president @entity6 's deadline to enact health care reform by the end of the year , a key @entity3 senator said tuesday			1
@entity10 ' @entity9 , the second - highest ranking @entity11 in the @entity12 , said he hopes , at best , to pass the @entity12 's version of a health care bill by that time			1
if the @entity12 manages to pass a bill , a congressional conference committee would need to merge the @entity18 and @entity12 proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to @entity6 's desk to be signed into law			2
@entity9 's assessment came as former president @entity25 made a rare visit to @entity27 to discuss the health care issue with @entity29			1
@entity25 tried but ultimately failed to pass a health care overhaul in the early 1990s			1
the failure is considered one of the reasons for the @entity35 takeover of @entity4 in the 1994 midterm elections			0
" whatever their differences are , i just urged them to resolve their differences and pass a bill , " @entity25 said on @entity27			1
" i also believe , you know , people hired us to come to work in places like this to solve problems and stand up and do it			0
" @entity25 told the senators that they had a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to push through a reform package that is crucial to the country 's long - term economic health			2
" he made a strong case for getting it done this year , " said sen. @entity56 of @entity57			0
" he is brilliant , " said sen. @entity60 of @entity61			0
" he is able to penetrate through the fog of policy and politics better than any person i 've heard			0
" @entity9 blamed the shifting timeline on a slower - than - expected cost analysis from the nonpartisan @entity69 on legislation being crafted under @entity72 's direction			2
he also cited an uncertain schedule for floor debate			0
@entity9 said he hopes debate in the full @entity12 will begin before @entity76			1
senate majority leader @entity72 himself has signaled uncertainty over whether the fractious @entity12 could meet @entity6 's goal of passing a bill this year			1
among the many obstacles @entity72 is facing is whether to include a government - run public option			2
the majority leader has proposed including an option that would give states until 2014 to decide whether to opt out			1
but several @entity3 moderates -- as well as sen. @entity88 of @entity89 , the lone @entity12 @entity35 to vote for reform -- have expressed deep reservations over the idea			2
@entity72 has little room to compromise and maneuver			0
he would need the support of every @entity12 @entity11 and @entity96 independent @entity95 -- an opponent of the public option -- to get the 60 votes necessary to cut off a likely @entity35 filibuster			1
@entity95 has faced a backlash from @entity29 and liberal protesters over his threat to filibuster any bill that included a public option			1
on tuesday , police arrested six demonstrators in @entity95 's @entity27 office after a group protesting his views on health care legislation refused to leave			1
@entity95 was not there at the time			0
a group calling itself the mobilization for @entity115 littered the floor and hallway with symbolic " money " and said that campaign donations to @entity95 by the insurance industry have affected his judgment of health care legislation			1
the group is upset that @entity95 refuses to support the public option , which they believe would reduce the number of people without health care insurance			1
meanwhile , could resort to reconciliation -- a budgetary maneuver that would require only a simple majority in the 100 - vote chamber -- but such a move would add complications to the legislative process and further erode what is already a poisonous political atmosphere			0
@entity3 leaders in the @entity18 and the @entity12 , however , have reached agreement on a broad range of changes that could affect every @entity144 's coverage			2
among other things , they have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $ 88,000 annually , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level			0
they 've also agreed to expand @entity150 and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small businesses , the self - employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage			0
they 'd also limit total out - of - pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			0
insurers would also be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history			0
@entity1 's @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
