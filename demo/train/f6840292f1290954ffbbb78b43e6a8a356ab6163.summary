@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been 10 years since federal agents raided the @entity5 home in @entity0 's @entity8 neighborhood , seizing 6 - year - old @entity9			1

his school uniform still hangs in the closet , along with dozens of outfits that he never got a chance to wear			0
his toys are on display inside the house , as well as a giant image of the infamous @entity28 photo showing a federal agent pointing a weapon toward @entity31 and @entity32 , who had been hiding the boy in a bedroom closet			1
" the story is still very vivid in this area , " says @entity35 , a local radio reporter who covered the story			0
" people think that it was just yesterday that they took @entity31			1
" the custody dispute that led to @entity31 's seizure made national headlines , partly because of the possible impact on already tense @entity17 - @entity16 relations and also on the 2000 presidential election			1
@entity31 was found off the coast of @entity48 , @entity1 , in november 1999 , the only survivor of a group of 13 @entity16 migrants trying to make it to the @entity17			1
his mother was among the dead			0
his father , in @entity16 , demanded his return , but relatives in @entity0 refused to release him , touching off a seven - month international custody battle			1
eventually , attorney general @entity59 decided to send @entity31 back to @entity16 , but she failed to persuade his relatives in @entity0 to relinquish custody of @entity31 to his father			1
so , during the predawn hours of april 22 , 2000 , armed federal agents raided @entity65 's home and seized the boy , reuniting him with his father			1
vice president @entity67 , who was running for president at the time , broke ranks with the @entity71 administration , calling for the matter to be settled in @entity1 's family court system			0
@entity67 was accused of pandering to @entity1 's @entity16 - @entity17 voters , because the state was a battleground state in the presidential vote			2
today , largely sheltered from prying eyes , 16 - year - old @entity31 attends a @entity16 military academy in the @entity16 city of @entity81			1
state media recently published photos of the trim - haired teen in his olive green and red uniform participating in the annual @entity87			0
@entity2 's @entity88 spoke to @entity31 's grandmother in his hometown of @entity91			2
she said he comes home every weekend to visit his family there			0
" now he 's a man , a little man , " said @entity94 , standing on the porch of the modest house where @entity31 used to live with his father			2
" he has a normal life , the way he wants it			0
" a plaque denouncing what many in @entity16 call the " @entity0 mafia " hangs on the front of the house			1
she said @entity31 gets top grades , but still has time for " a lot of girlfriends , just like any normal boy			2
" @entity31 's immediate family has moved to another part of town to avoid outside intrusions on their life			2
when @entity31 returned to @entity16 in june 2000 , he and his father found themselves with front - row seats to @entity16 president @entity118 's rallies			1
@entity118 himself had led the battle to bring @entity31 back			2
on more than one occasion , @entity31 himself took the stage			2
" it 's been five years since i returned with my dad , " he said at one event			0
" and it was possible because of my family , the @entity16 people and commander @entity118			2
" @entity118 and @entity31 also had a personal relationship			0
the aging president attended his birthday celebrations			0
since @entity118 was sidelined by illness , @entity31 has largely disappeared from the media and public events			0
@entity91 -- like @entity0 -- has a museum honoring @entity31 , but it tells a different story			1
it features a statue of a defiant young @entity31 , photos and even the original t - shirt worn by one of the fishermen who found the boy drifting at sea			0
a sculpture of a giant middle finger reads " @entity16 's answer , " apparently being flipped at the country 's nemesis to the north			0
will it ever be possible for @entity31 to lead a normal , quiet life ? " it 's up to @entity31 , " one of the museum tour guides said			0
" he could play a role in the country 's future , but only if he wants to			0
" @entity2 's @entity160 and @entity161 in @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity88 and @entity162 in @entity91 , @entity16 , contributed to this report			1
