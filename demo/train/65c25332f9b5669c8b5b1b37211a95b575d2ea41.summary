@entity0 , @entity1 -- visitors shuttle in and out of a state - of - the - art hospital in an @entity1 town once devastated by towering tsunami waves five years ago , while in nearby @entity7 backpackers dance to music in bars and tourists lodge in a hotel that had been demolished in the @entity14 disaster			1
over in @entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity19 -- all hit by the waters that claimed the lives of some 245,000 people in 14 nations on december 26 , 2004 -- homes , schools and roads have been rebuilt , and livelihoods reclaimed			1
the road to recovery in the @entity29 countries battered by the tsunami , which washed away entire communities , created nearly $ 10 billion in damage and caused more casualties than any other tsunami in recorded history , has been steady despite some challenges , according to the @entity38 and local officials			1
" it was essential to have discussions with communities about what they wanted and needed			1
the result took a little bit longer but was much better			1
this is the essence of this ' build back better ' concept , to have people involved in the reconstruction , " said @entity44 , @entity1 country director for the @entity45			1
" the most important lesson learned from this massive recovery effort is the importance of involving the people who are affected in the process , in a really meaningful way , " he added			1
did you survive the tsunami ? did you lose a loved one ? share your thoughts on the 5th anniversary on @entity61 in @entity0 , a special government - backed agency , @entity62 , was set up to oversee the vast rebuilding			1
that agency was superseded by the @entity66 this year , and together they have overseen the spending of $ 3.2 billion dollars of aid money			1
that money has been ploughed into the state - of - the - art hospital , a new terminal building at the airport , hundreds of bridges , nearly two dozen ports , some 1,800 schools , 3,800 mosques and about 150,000 homes			2
to local conservationist @entity79 , who said much of @entity0 had been reduced to a " level plane of shards " and who compared the tsunami aftermath to that of the atomic bombing of @entity86 in @entity87 , the town has quickly bounced back			2
" it 's so built up now , " he said as he stood near a mosque where he had surveyed the damage in 2004 -- a time when nothing blocked a clear vision out to sea due to the tsunami destruction			1
" now , we can barely see 100 meters because there 's been so much reconstruction			2
everything 's been built up on both sides of the road			2
" in @entity7 , few physical reminders of the disaster remain			2
the tourist industry was keen to clean up and move on as soon as possible			2
on islands like @entity107 , where the powerful waves ripped through shops and eateries , and sliced off treetops , it is business as usual with bustling bars , cafes and hotels			2
today , the thumping music and jolly backpackers give the island the party atmosphere it had before the disaster , and it is the same in nearby @entity122			2
lodgings , like the @entity124 -- the destruction of which was immortalized in dramatic amateur video , have been rebuilt and expanded			2
overall , some $ 13.5 billion in aid was pledged after the tsunami , including $ 5.5 billion coming in from the general public , according to the @entity45			1
" i think it was the timing			0
a lot of people were celebrating , it was @entity138 and i think a lot of people were really , really touched when they saw those pictures , " said @entity132 , of the @entity38 children 's agency , @entity133 , in @entity7			1
" it was phenomenal , it was unprecedented , i think contributions just flooded in from individuals , from companies , from children themselves			0
at @entity133 , we received $ 700 million			1
we know that children in many , many countries themselves got together to raise money			0
i think the tsunami really touched people 's hearts			1
" most homes have been rebuilt in the @entity19 and in @entity18 , a majority of the lost infrastructure -- such as the 105,000 homes destroyed or damaged in the tsunami -- has been rebuilt			0
in @entity17 , rehabilitation is complete in the hard - hit southern state of @entity161 , but efforts are under way to build a few thousand new homes for those living in high - risk areas ; most homes have been reconstructed in the @entity168 and @entity169 , as well as in @entity170 , along the southeast coast			0
but there have been some delays in southern @entity17 in @entity174 , where 11,000 homes were to be constructed , with only 51 so far completed and handed over to survivors			0
authorities blame the delay on issues regarding land acquisition and they have decided to pay residents to rebuild their homes on their own , said @entity183 , private secretary to @entity174 's revenue minister			1
back in @entity1 , some of the housing built for survivors remains empty due to poor construction that in some cases does not include drinking water or protect against the torrential rains			1
in one area , stands dozens of abandoned and empty houses built by an aid agency			1
a woman named @entity196 , who lost her husband and three children in the tsunami , has little income and feels she should have gotten more help			0
" the walls are made of wood , " she said of her new home			0
" i had to change them myself , because when it rains , the water gets inside the house			0
we do n't even have drinking water here			0
" @entity211 , of the @entity66 , acknowledged that in some cases standards were not met but said the overall quality of new homes was good and corruption has been kept to a minimum			0
" the building quality depends on the contractor and material used			0
some are good ; some are not			0
the donor projects were generally good			0
we closely monitored how the houses were built			0
there were penalties for the contractors if they failed to meet the quality standard , " he said			0
many people across the region will mark the anniversary with prayers , a moment of silence , sprinkling water on mass graves in @entity1 and offering food to monks in @entity7 , among other memorials as people in the region try to move forward			1
" i try not to remember all the details , " said @entity7 hotel manager @entity242 , who still has painful memories of that fateful day			0
" we try to remember the good things and forget the bad things			0
the tsunami brought us tears			0
