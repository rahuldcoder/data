-- @entity2 's worrying mini-slump came to an end on saturday , but it was not new signing @entity5 or $ 80 million man @entity7 who fired the @entity9 club back up to third in the @entity10			1
it was another forward who did the damage -- not only to his reputation , but also to @entity16 's longstanding unbeaten home record			1
@entity17 became just the fourth player to score two own - goals in a @entity10 match , and possibly the first to also miss a penalty , as @entity2 cruised to a 4 - 0 victory at the @entity23			1
it lifted the pressure on manager @entity26 after successive home defeats to the @entity10 's bottom team @entity28 and then in the first leg of the @entity31 semifinals against @entity32 on wednesday			1
" it was a difficult game , especially in the first half			0
we knew it would be , " @entity26 told reporters after his team closed to within 11 points of leaders @entity38 , who face @entity41 on sunday			0
" we knew it would be physical and intense , but we were ready for that			0
the goal changed the game because they had to go forward and left space , which meant little by little we could control the game			0
" the scores were level until first - half injury time , when @entity17 headed a cross from @entity2 defender @entity53 past his own keeper			1
it got worse for the @entity56 international in the 62nd minute , as he again headed past @entity59 from @entity61 's corner			0
@entity61 was brought down soon after , allowing veteran midfielder @entity62 to continue his scoring run with a penalty , and @entity65 sealed it with a superb long - range effort			2
there was still time for @entity17 to gain some redemption in his 100th @entity10 appearance but , given the chance to net his sixth league goal for @entity16 this season after being fouled by the returning @entity73 , the 29 - year - old blasted his injury - time penalty against the crossbar			1
we look after people at the football club			0
it was n't our day today , it was @entity2 's day , " said @entity16 manager @entity81 , whose 10th - placed team lost at home for the first time since february , a run of 17 games			1
@entity73 came on as a second - half substitute , having been out for two months with a knee injury			1
" i was trying to give him some minutes to see how he was , " @entity26 said			0
" i watched him in the reserve team but this is totally different , so we played five at the back and tried to protect him a bit			0
" we will see how he trains and if he has no problems , it is a question of fitness now			0
" fellow central defender @entity100 missed the match to be at the birth of his son			0
" the baby is fine and they are happy , " @entity26 said			0
@entity106 failed to stay in third place after being held 0 - 0 at @entity28 , now managed by former @entity106 boss @entity108			1
it was @entity111 's final appearance for @entity106 before leaving for the @entity112 , having patched up his differences with @entity115 officials			2
despite two strong results against top - four teams , @entity108 's side are now two points adrift at the bottom of the table following @entity123 's 3 - 2 win at home to seventh - placed @entity125			2
the promoted side scored three goals in the last 10 minutes , with the winner from @entity130 striker @entity129 , after on - loan @entity2 striker @entity131 netted twice in the first half			2
@entity133 stayed fifth , three points behind @entity106 , after being held 0 - 0 by ninth - placed @entity32			1
@entity135 moved out of the bottom three with a 1 - 0 win at @entity137 that dropped the home side into the relegation zone , putting more pressure on manager @entity141			2
striker @entity142 scored the only goal from the penalty spot for his ninth league goal this season			0
@entity147 moved up to 14th with a 3 - 0 win over @entity149 that left the @entity9 side in 11th , above @entity151 on goal difference			2
@entity151 drew 0 - 0 at home to struggling @entity154 , while @entity155 moved above @entity137 on goal difference after coming from behind to draw 1 - 1 at 13th - placed @entity157 .			1
