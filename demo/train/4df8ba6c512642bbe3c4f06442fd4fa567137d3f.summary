-- my job as an imam and outreach director for the @entity5 , located minutes from the @entity6 and the @entity7 , was created september 11 , 2001 , to convey a more accurate image of the @entity9 and to create opportunities for interfaith cooperation and understanding distinct from the stereotypical image of @entity13 as intolerant and violent religious anti-american extremists			1
on the morning of the 9/11 attack , while i was calling my patients from the waiting room at @entity18 , i saw the plumes of smoke in the distance coming from the @entity6 , and on the tv monitor watched the twin towers of the @entity24 being destroyed			1
i had been volunteering as the @entity13 chaplain and imam at @entity18 at that time , and the media began calling me for interviews			1
by 2002 , the @entity5 asked me to be their first outreach director			1
i left my work as a biomedical researcher , working on my doctorate studying sickle cell disease , and took up this work			1
much like the tradition of the black church , i believe i was " called " to this ministry to bring people back together , to try to heal a lot of the pain , fear and anger that persisted			1
the work i do in the greater @entity44 area is similar to what @entity45 and @entity46 [ @entity47 ] want to do with the @entity49 at @entity50 , which is being referred to as the " @entity52 mosque			1
" i know how important this work is , since i do it every day , reaching out to @entity53 , @entity55 and other faith groups as well as colleges , universities , government and the media in order to find common ground and understanding			2
in march of this year , a group protested my leading an opening prayer for the @entity65			2
i called the delegate who was responsible for the official invitation -- @entity68 , who is white , @entity55 , male and gay			2
he said he looked at the work i had been doing for almost a decade , and said " i will stand by you			2
" that was a teachable moment			2
later , members of the @entity74 said this was one of the most impressive prayers they had heard , and that they were convinced they were hearing from the type of @entity13 that we need in @entity79			1
the struggle for equal access , for the right to build mosques in @entity79 -- not just in lower @entity84 -- is reminiscent of the pain and struggle of black @entity79 for churches , housing , employment and , actually , public acceptance			2
by the letter of the law , blacks had the right to live or work anywhere , but they were often segregated to certain areas and specific jobs			1
similarly , @entity79 @entity13 have the right to worship anywhere , but some @entity79 say we 're not ready yet for mosques being built in certain areas			1
some years ago i preached in the @entity101 to 70,000 @entity102 at the " @entity103			0
" i wondered why they invited me			0
as i saw their communities and felt a reminiscent pain of being a second - class citizen in my country , then i knew why @entity110 made me a black @entity79 at this time : to share my hope and faith			0
i told them the @entity115 teaches , " o you who believe ! stand out firmly as a witness before @entity110 ; and let not the enmity and hatred by others allow you to depart from justice			0
be just : that is closer to piety ; and fear @entity126			0
indeed , @entity126 is well - acquainted with what you do			0
" [ @entity129 5 : 8 ] i realized then that as an heir through the civil rights and black power movements , and now as a @entity13 , i am building a bridge from one faith tradition and civil rights movement to another faith and new civil rights movement -- from the fight for civil rights for black @entity79 , to the fight to secure the right for @entity79 @entity13 to overcome and live beyond the " terrorist " stigma in a post- 9/11 world , to make a better @entity79 for everybody			1
the spiritual says , " i come too far from where i started from , nobody told me the road would be easy			0
" establishing @entity50 is another step on the road to equality for all people			0
it must succeed for all of us			0
these @entity13 who respect @entity79 want to continue to pray , live and work in their community in lower @entity84			1
while honoring our fallen citizens , we must continue to uphold the banner of freedom -- not guilt by association			0
although i thrive off the passion of @entity161 , i engage in struggle with the compassion of dr. @entity164			0
" we shall overcome " once again			0
@entity79 eventually gets it right			0
that @entity79 will once again choose the road toward freedom , justice and equality for all people , and that is the @entity79 that i believe in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			1
