-- there are heads growing on @entity4 's farm , and they 're not made of lettuce			1
they 're called " pumpkinsteins , " and they look a lot like the @entity10 creature that actor @entity11 made famous more than 80 years ago			2
" nobody 's ever seen anything like it , ever , " said @entity4 of his creepy creations			1
" it 's so new , and it 's so unique that demand has been off the charts , " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 , who opened his @entity21 eight years ago , says he was inspired after seeing cube - shaped watermelons grown in @entity23			1
he was successful in creating not only edible , box - shaped watermelons at his @entity26 , @entity27 , organic farm , but heart - shaped melons as well			0
he then made the leap to try to create a unique - looking pumpkin -- a four - year process that is only proving fruitful this year			2
" a lot of people thought i was nuts , " the goateed farmer told @entity0 during a visit to see his crops			0
" when i first started doing this i think every farmer in the world looked at me like i was a complete lunatic			0
" it was a scary prospect for @entity4 , who says he not only invested all of his money , but also that of friends and family , as he experimented with different varieties of pumpkins and various materials and designs for the mold			1
an early design of the frankenstein monster was dismissed as being too spooky , so the mouth was changed to create a slight smile			0
@entity56 needed to create a strong mold that could encase a pumpkin , yet permit air to reach the growing gourd inside			0
6 surprising health benefits of pumpkins the pumpkin variety had to be just right			2
they could n't be too big or they 'd burst from the molds			2
too small and the pumpkins would n't fill the molds			1
@entity56 wo n't go into much more detail to protect his investment , but he 's more than happy to share his reaction upon unveiling his first successful pumpkinstein			0
" that first time we pulled it off , and it worked , we all looked at each other			0
" said @entity4 , " it was high fives all around			1
" but there 's still a learning curve			0
@entity4 says he produced 5,500 pumpkins this year , but that 's only a 60 % success rate			1
the biggest complications : heat , bugs and too much condensation , all of which can rot the pumpkins within the molds at any time during their more than three - month growing period			1
@entity4 does n't know whether he has a thriving pumpkinstein until he removes the nuts and bolts from the mold and successfully removes the pumpkin			1
if the pumpkin 's shell sticks to the mold and tears during this final process , the squash is squashed			0
" there 's absolutely zero return on it , " @entity4 explained			1
5 scary good @entity109 treats @entity4 believes he 's developed the skills now to produce a bumper crop of his creations next year			1
he predicts a 90 % success rate totaling some 40,000 pumpkinsteins			1
but do n't expect pumpkinsteins to boot jack - o ' - lanterns off the porch completely			2
they 're not cheap , costing $ 100 or more at some @entity27 markets specializing in organic produce , such as @entity121 and @entity122			1
they are already sold out online at cinagro - farms.com			0
while the price scared off most customers with whom @entity0 spoke at @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity27 , all of them were fascinated at the @entity10 farmer 's feat. " i 've never seen anything like this , " said 13 - year - old @entity132			2
" it 's really cool			0
" " that 's weird , but i like it , " said @entity136 , calling the pumpkin a real @entity109 eye - grabber			0
" people would stop and look at it			0
" that 's the novelty that @entity56 is banking on , but he 's already creating something to rival his own pumpkinsteins			0
he says he 'll be planting white pumpkins and growing them in the shape of skulls , another face to help get this farmer ahead next @entity109 .			2
