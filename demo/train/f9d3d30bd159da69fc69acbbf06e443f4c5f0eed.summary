-- fans of the character @entity3 do n't want to hear it , but author @entity5 says he has officially moved on			1
author @entity5 found fame with his @entity3 mysteries and has debuted a new series			1
the prolific writer seemingly wrapped up his beloved series -- which spawned the 1995 film " @entity13 " starring @entity12 -- in 2007 with the 10th @entity3 mystery , " @entity15			1
" the ending saddened die - hard fans who had faithfully followed the adventures of the @entity19 , @entity20 - based everyman - turned - private investigator whose stories played out in an era from the @entity23 1940s to the politically charged 1960s			1
now @entity5 , who has found success writing everything from erotica to science fiction , has launched a new mystery series with the release of his book " the @entity31 " ( @entity32 )			1
the book features an ex-boxer named @entity35 , the latest colorfully named @entity5 character			1
three of his previous books involved ex-convict @entity39 , and another trio concerned bookseller @entity41			0
but the new novel takes @entity5 to a different place and time			1
instead of mid- 20th century @entity19 , " the @entity31 " is set in modern - day @entity45 , where @entity35 is finding it hard to leave his less - than - stellar past behind			1
that past includes a childhood as a red - diaper baby abandoned by his union organizer father and left to fend for himself at an early age , a loveless marriage to an unfaithful woman named @entity57 and a son who 's a burgeoning criminal mastermind			2
moreover , he 's at work on a case where you just know people are going to die			0
such page turners are nothing new for @entity5 , who is known for his strong , black male characters and his passionate musings on race , politics and the writing life			1
@entity35 's creator recently spoke with @entity0 about the new mystery novel , why he does n't miss @entity3 , and how the changes in the @entity74 are mirrored in his writing			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity0 : why leave @entity19 for a setting in modern - day @entity45 ? @entity5 : i have been a resident of both cities			1
the new series being contemporary and about a character who in some murky ways reflects where @entity74 is right now , @entity45 seemed the right place for that			1
@entity0 : how so ? where do you think @entity74 is right now ? @entity5 : i think that @entity74 has made a decision , after about 20 years of going in one direction , to go in another direction : to leave rampant and amoral kind of deregulation and also rampant and immoral wars and say , " maybe we should be doing the right thing instead of the wrong thing , " or redefining what the right thing is , at any rate			2
those kinds of decisions , there are only two places [ the setting ] can be , and that 's either in @entity109 , which i feel is very limiting because it 's a one - business town , or @entity45 , where everything from economics to government is centered			1
so i decided on @entity45			2
@entity0 : @entity35 is trying to leave behind his shady past			0
do you feel like @entity74 is trying to do the same ? @entity5 : yes , i think that 's exactly what 's happening			2
i think @entity74 is trying to seek redemption after having done many things wrong in the eyes of the world in general			0
@entity123 is trying to seek redemption after a long criminal history			2
his history is somewhat forgivable , but still it 's criminal			0
@entity0 : did you approach this book differently than you did when you were writing the @entity3 mysteries ? @entity5 : yes and no. all books are different , so each of the @entity3 books i wrote i approached differently			1
[ @entity35 ] is a new character and he has a unique life that i had to begin to learn			0
i knew @entity3 very well , but @entity35 i had to learn who he was			2
@entity0 : in your new book , i love that @entity35 's wife 's name is " @entity57 " and she leaves lots of destruction in her wake			0
@entity5 : [ chuckling ] it 's true , but the first story i wrote about @entity35 [ a story called " @entity147 " published in the anthology " @entity149 " ] was before the hurricane and that was a long time ago			1
it 's funny that it worked out like that			0
@entity0 : what do you like about @entity35 ? @entity5 : this is the first time in my experiments in crime fiction that i 've written a hard - boiled detective character			1
this is going all the way back to the beginning of the genre in the ' 30s , where you have a guy who gets thumped upside the head a lot and he 's just as bad as the people he 's after			0
in the old style , you never knew what was going on inside the hard - boiled character 's head , but in these stories i am actually discovering the underlying character of the hard - boiled detective , and for me that 's been a great deal of fun			1
@entity0 : you 've written so many various genres			0
what is it about the genre of crime fiction that appeals to you ? @entity5 : originally i got into it because you can talk about worlds that people would n't read about ordinarily unless they had a particular interest in it			2
everybody reads crime fiction and they read it to find out about different worlds			0
i like writing in different genres			0
there 's all this stuff that i really enjoy doing because i think they all serve different purposes			0
and listen , i 'm known as a crime writer , people like it and i enjoy it			0
@entity0 : for your fans , a lot of them miss @entity3			2
do you miss him at all ? @entity5 : no , he 's right there on the shelf			2
all i have to do is reach up and pull him down			0
i 'm finished with that			0
i 'm moving on .			0
