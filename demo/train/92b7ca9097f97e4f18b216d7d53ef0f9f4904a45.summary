-- political discussions about @entity3 's nuclear aspirations were benched thursday when the @entity5 and @entity3 national basketball teams went head to head at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the @entity5 clinched first place in @entity12 with an 88 - 51 win over @entity3			1
but most of the attention was n't directed toward the players ' performance or their skills on the court ; rather , it was the fact that the two teams -- whose countries have no diplomatic relations -- were sharing the same court for the first time			1
" yeah i get a lot of questions , most of it about the politics			0
but our game is nothing to do about the politics , it 's just the sport , " @entity3 player @entity30 told @entity0			1

only about a quarter of the seats in @entity69 in @entity9 were occupied for the game , and a majority of the spectators were @entity3 or expatriates			1
@entity74 , who plays for the @entity52 's @entity75 , was the crowd favorite as he played for his home country			2
through a sea of @entity3 flags and banners , only a handful of @entity5 flags were visible , but one group of fans held up an @entity5 flag and an @entity3 flag with a sign in between them reading " peace			1
" relations between the two countries have been strained further in recent years due to @entity3 's nuclear program , which @entity93 insists is for peaceful purposes			1
but @entity95 and many of its allies fear @entity3 may be trying to develop nuclear weapons			2
diplomatic ties between the @entity5 and @entity3 were cut in 1980 , after @entity3 students seized the @entity100 in @entity93 in 1979 and held 52 @entity5 hostage for more than a year			1
despite any outside pressures both teams may have felt looming from home , they were not shown on the court			0

" i 've been to @entity3			2
i played there in the early 70s , in @entity93 , " he said after the game			0
" i have good friends that are of @entity3 descent in the @entity5			1
so i have a good feeling for the @entity3 people			2
there 's no political aspect in my mind about the ballgame			0
" the @entity3 team 's coach , who is from @entity137 , laughed when discussing the media attention surrounding the game			1
