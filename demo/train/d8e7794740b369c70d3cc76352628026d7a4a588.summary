-- @entity2 's governor has signed into law a bill requiring physicians performing abortions in the state to be a board - certified obstetrician - gynecologist and to have admitting privileges at an area hospital			1
" i believe that all human life is precious , and as governor , i will work to ensure that the lives of the born and unborn are protected in @entity2 , " gov. @entity14 said in a statement monday			1
he has previously expressed his desire that the state become " abortion free			2
" seven other states require abortion providers to have hospital privileges , but no other state requires that an abortion provider be an @entity25 , said @entity26 , state issues manager for the @entity27 in @entity28			1
though the 1973 @entity31 landmark decision in @entity32 made abortion legal in all 50 states , @entity2 's law could make the state the first where no abortions could be performed , she said			1
" it 's an attempt to eliminate access without taking on @entity32 directly			0
" @entity2 has only one abortion facility , @entity40			0
should it close , @entity2 women seeking abortions would have to leave the state			1
the clinic 's owner , @entity45 , said in a telephone interview this month that all her doctors are obstetrician - gynecologists , but only one has admitting privileges at an area hospital			2
she vowed to fight to remain open			0
" we are going to do everything we can to remain there ... we are not going to let the women of @entity2 down , " said @entity45			0
but lt. gov. @entity56 previously said that the bill " should effectively close the only abortion clinic in @entity2			1
" the bill " puts in place requirements that intentionally try to make it impossible for physicians to provide abortion services , " @entity59 , regional director of public policy for @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity2 , said in early april			1
there is no medical reason to require physicians performing abortions be board - certified @entity71 or that they have admitting privileges , she said			0
if the clinic stops offering abortion services because it is unable to find providers with those qualifications , the bill " would be a backdoor ban on abortion			1
" the @entity80 ' state advocacy counsel , @entity79 , said that , if the goal of the legislation is to impose restrictions on abortion providers that are not imposed on other medical providers offering similar care , then " that would raise serious constitutional problems and a legal challenge would certainly be possible			2
" " it 's not about medicine , " she said			0
" it 's just about politics			0
" last year , the state introduced a bill known as the @entity97 , which would have defined life as beginning at the moment of conception			2
the bill was defeated by voters in november			0
in 2008 , the last year for which data are available , 2,770 abortions were performed in the state , according to @entity105			2
@entity0 's @entity106 and @entity107 contributed to this report			0

the bill could force the state 's lone abortion clinic to close
no other state requires an abortion provider to be an @entity25
governor : " " i believe that all human life is precious "
