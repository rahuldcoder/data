@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 are getting help from other tech companies in their fight to release more information about government surveillance orders , which companies say is their @entity11 right to provide			1
on monday , @entity2 and @entity3 were joined by @entity12 and @entity13 in asking the @entity14 to allow them to make public aggregate data listing the number of court - ordered records requests , including those made for criminal and national security investigations			1
the companies , in court filings made with the surveillance court , portrayed the government 's attempt to block them from publishing more detailed data as a version of prior restraint , infringing their right to exercise their first amendment rights			1
the move seeks to set a high bar for the government to stop publication , akin to the @entity35 administration 's failed attempt to stop newspapers from publishing the @entity37			0
according to the companies ' court filings , the data is n't classified , but the government seeks to prevent publication on national security grounds			2
they argue there are ways for them to tell their customers more about the government 's requests , with broad statistics every six months , without compromising individual security investigations			2
the companies argue that they are acting to correct the public record on national security requests they are compelled to obey			2
they cite disclosures by @entity56 , a fugitive former @entity58 contractor who says he leaked thousands of documents on government surveillance , which has led to erroneous news stories , the companies say			1
all say they do not allow the government direct access to their computer servers			0
@entity3 in its filing says , " notwithstanding @entity3 's complete denial , the revelations about the scope of the @entity58 activities , and false or misleading stories about @entity3 's alleged involvement in such activities , have continued unabated and continue to cause substantial harm to @entity3 's reputation and business			1
" the other companies also said their businesses were being harmed by not being allowed to provide more information			1
in the court filings , the companies are asking to publish how many government data requests are for content and how many are for so - called metadata , which includes information such as the sender and receiver of e-mails and phone calls , and the time and date when they are sent or made			2
@entity3 and @entity2 also asked to make oral arguments on the legal fights ; @entity3 asked that the court , which normally conducts its proceedings in secret , allow arguments open to the public			1
@entity100 , director of national intelligence , has said the agency plans to publish broad data on criminal and national security surveillance requests			0
but that data would n't show requests made to each company			0
the legal tussle came as the technology company officials went to the @entity109 as part of a new " working group " focusing on transparency			0
the @entity114 administration has defended the @entity58 's surveillance activities , saying they are necessary to prevent terrorism and protect national security			2
but president @entity114 has acknowledged the need for greater transparency and invited companies to help come up with new ways to disclose more			0
@entity2 and @entity3 first made their request to publish surveillance data in june and then spent the last few months negotiating with the government			1
after failing to reach an agreement , the companies got permission from the surveillance court to make new legal filings			0
the deadline for those filings was monday			0
the @entity131 declined to comment on the case .			0
