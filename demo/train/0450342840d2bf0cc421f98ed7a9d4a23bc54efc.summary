@entity0 -- the @entity3 's handling of disability claims has seen improvements and setbacks , a congressional watchdog said wednesday			1
sen. @entity8 says , " our goal is to provide veterans with accurate and timely resolution to their cases			0
" " over the past several years , @entity3 disability claims workloads at both the initial and appellate levels have improved in some areas and worsened in others , " the @entity14 said in a report			1
the @entity20 asked the @entity14 to present its preliminary findings on the processing of disability claims , which were under discussion at a committee hearing			1
" our goal is to provide veterans with accurate and timely resolution to their cases , " said sen. @entity8 , @entity26 , the committee 's chairman			0
ranking member sen. @entity30 , @entity31 , said , " for the men and women who have served and sacrificed for our nation , they deserve a system that meets their needs without hassles or delays			0
" along with a @entity14 representative , the hearing invited testimony from the @entity44 and the @entity3 , a professor and an official from the @entity47			2
the @entity14 report said the number of initial claims the @entity3 annually completes has increased from the 1999 to 2008 fiscal years			1
but it says the number of pending claims at year 's end has grown during the same time period			1
the review cites " increases in disability claims received , growing complexity of claims , court decisions and changes in regulation			2
" there have been mixed results for claims workloads at the appellate level			0
the number of resolved claims has increased from 2003 to 2008 , but it took an average 96 days longer to resolve appeals during that same time period			0

the report said the @entity3 has worked to improve the handling of claims but said the results of those efforts " is not yet known			2
" it mentions an increase in staff from 2005 to 2009 , " which has helped to increase the total number of decisions @entity3 issues annually			1
" at the same time , training and staff integration challenges could cause a " short - term " decline in productivity " in addition , @entity3 has established 15 resource centers to which it redistributes claims and appeals for processing from backlogged regional offices			2
although @entity3 has not collected data to evaluate the effect of its workload redistribution efforts , these efforts may ultimately increase the timeliness and consistency of @entity3 's decisions , " the report said			1
the @entity3 is starting a pilot program with the @entity44 " to perform joint disability evaluations that has the potential to streamline the disability process for prospective veterans			0
