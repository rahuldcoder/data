-- the search for a 2 - year old boy who went missing in suburban @entity6 more than a week ago continued monday with no new suspects or information in the case , @entity2 , @entity3 , police said			1
maj. @entity10 said his department had received 900 tips in the boy 's disappearance , but none " have led to any high - priority actionable evidence			1
" though none of those leads has led to a breakthrough in the investigation , @entity10 urged the public to continue providing information in the case			0
he said the case could eventually become a " criminal investigation , " but " we 're not there			0
" " all theories are viable , " @entity10 said			0
" we have not ruled anything out as a possibility in this case			0
... the thing that we 're lacking is evidence			0
" over the weekend , @entity10 said police had expanded the search radius at the apartment in @entity37 where toddler @entity38 lived with his mother , @entity40 , and the wooded area where she told police she last saw her son nine days ago			1
the brown - eyed boy with short , dark hair was last seen wearing a dark - green hooded sweatshirt and blue - and - gray - striped pants			2
on friday , @entity10 said the police were " frustrated by the lack of information we 're getting " from the boy 's mother			1
according to @entity10 , @entity40 initially reported that she 'd run out of gas early november 6 in @entity2 , just east of @entity6 , leaving the toddler in the car while she took her 4 - year - old with her to get help			1
police later determined that the car had gas and was working			2
" i 'll let the evidence speak for itself , which is : there was gas in the car ; the car was able to drive and operate , " @entity10 said			0
" that 's not what @entity40 told us			2
" but on monday , @entity10 told reporters that he was " not comfortable calling her a person of interest or a suspect			0
" he said the boy 's mother " continues to cooperate , " though she has not responded to requests issued through her attorney " to come and talk to us at length			1
" " it 's something we 're going to keep trying to do , " the police major said of the outreach efforts to @entity40			1
other than the boy 's mother and his 4 - year - old sister , no one has reported seeing the toddler in the past two weeks , police spokeswoman @entity84 said last week			1
attorneys for @entity40 have declined to comment to @entity0 about the case , citing the ongoing investigation			0
repeated attempts to reach @entity40 by @entity0 affiliates in the @entity2 and @entity37 area have been unsuccessful			1
the father , @entity97 , who is separated from @entity40 , told @entity99 's @entity98 on monday that he 'd taken two polygraph tests in recent weeks , declining to offer details on whether he 'd passed them or what questions he answered			1
" he 's always ready to assist law enforcement in any way , " added his attorney , @entity103 @entity97 said he had n't seen the children since december , having lost custody of them			1
he added that he was getting ready for church the sunday morning of november 6 when @entity40 reportedly woke the children up earlier to take his young son , @entity112 , for treatment at an area hospital			1
" we 've tried since january to get the children out of ( @entity40 's ) custody , " @entity115 told @entity99			2
court records indicate @entity112 's parents have had a tumultuous relationship			2
@entity40 has said she feared for her safety and that of her children around the elder @entity125 , according to records			2
" i am told by my husband @entity128 ( and ) his family that if i take any action towards custody of our children he will take them out of the country ( and ) i will never see them again , " she wrote in court papers			0
@entity97 responded in court filings that his wife suffered from mental health problems and was unable to care for the children on her own			0
both parents were charged in 2009 with reckless endangerment for leaving then - 3 - month - old @entity112 alone in their parked car			0
court records show they completed court - ordered parenting courses following the incident .			0
