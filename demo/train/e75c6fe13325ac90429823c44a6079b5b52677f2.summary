-- the 2012 shooting at @entity2 in @entity3 was tragic enough , but what has been playing out over the last few weeks has made the story even more stomach - wrenching			1
more than half the money raised by the @entity8 , a @entity9 - based charity that ostensibly was established to help the shooting victims ' families , has turned up missing along with one of the organization 's co-founders			1
as i write this column , law enforcement officials here in my state and elsewhere are trying to figure out why about $ 70,000 of the more than $ 100,000 raised by the group never made it to those families			0
unfortunately , this type of story has become far too common among charitable organizations			1
there are unscrupulous people in the world who try to exploit tragedies in order to enrich themselves			1
these people take advantage of the wonderful human trait of compassion for others			1
they undermine the most noble of selfless acts made on behalf of our brothers and sisters in need			0
so while our generous response to tragic events such as floods , fires , earthquakes or horrific crimes is admirable , it needs to be tempered with a sense of caution			0
when we spend our hard - earned money to buy goods or services , it is reasonable to compare prices and research product quality			1
we do this because we want to make wise purchasing decisions			0
it is imperative that we apply the same logic to our charitable contributions			0
in @entity9 , with a few exceptions , charitable organizations are required to register with the secretary of state 's @entity65 and file annual financial reports			0
many other states have similar reporting requirements			0
would - be donors who take the time to review these reports can learn a lot about charities that are soliciting funds -- such as how much of their funds are used for administrative costs and other expenses and how much are used to actually provide services to the needy			2
of course , not all charities follow the law			2
the @entity8 did n't register in @entity9			2
if a charity has n't registered in a state where it 's required to do so , then that should raise a red flag for potential donors			1
in addition to the information charities must provide to state governments , there are nonprofit organizations such as the @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 that can be useful resources			2
also , it helps to follow some basic rules before making a donation to a charity			2
reputable charities should n't object if you want to do some research and send them a donation later			1
ask questions such as : -- how will the money you donate be used ? -- how long has the charity been in operation ? where are its offices ? -- what types of programs and services would your donation help fund ? -- how much of the donation would be spent on the organization 's administrative expenses and other costs ? -- would a portion of the donation be kept by the solicitor as a fee ? if you get vague or unsatisfactory answers to those types of questions , you need to carefully consider whether your money might be better spent elsewhere			1
also , do n't ever make cash contributions			1
it 's much easier for cash to be misspent and it 's more difficult for donors to claim cash contributions as deductions on their tax forms			2
when paying by check , make the check payable to the organization , not an individual			0
and only pay with a credit card if the organization is well established and highly trusted			0
otherwise , you may be opening yourself up to the potential of identity theft			0
when tragedy strikes , we should help victims as quickly as possible			0
however , by taking the time to do a little research before giving to a charity , donors could prevent their money from falling into the wrong hands			1
and that , in turn , would help ensure that the truly needy get the aid and comfort they deserve			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

money from a charity to help victims of @entity2 shooting has gone missing
@entity165 : sham charities that exploit compassionate people are more common
he says @entity176 must do some research on charities before donating money
@entity165 : do n't let your money fall into the wrong hands , and never give cash
