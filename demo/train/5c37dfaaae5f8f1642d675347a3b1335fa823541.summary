they came home from school to find their father missing			1
it had started off like any other day			2
as usual , @entity6 dropped off his kids @entity7 , 17 , and @entity9 , 14 , at school in @entity11 , @entity12			1
@entity6 returned home to find @entity15 ( @entity15 ) agents waiting for him at his doorstep			2
@entity6 , an undocumented immigrant from @entity17 , was taken to a detention center			1
when the teens -- both legal residents -- came home to an empty house at the end of the day , they realized something was very wrong			1
it was their father , trying to reassure them that everything would be ok			2
" even though we knew my father might get deported , we never thought that it would actually happen , especially since @entity15 already took our mother away five years ago , " @entity29 told @entity30			1
@entity6 was deported to @entity17 , joining his wife , @entity35			1
suddenly , the teens ' parents were gone and the @entity39 children faced a frightening future with foster families and unfamiliar schools			1
it 's been weeks since that terrible day last september , and they still have n't seen either of their parents			1
the @entity39 kids " were devastated after their mother was deported , " said @entity46 , a family friend and immigrant rights activist			1
now , they 're " living a tragedy ... they 've lost everything , their parents , home ... everything			2
" now they 're living with @entity57 and her husband and two girls in @entity61			2
how immigration reform would affect 3 families @entity15 told @entity30 in a written statement that @entity6 was arrested last year and was allowed to return home under certain conditions , such as attending appointments with immigration authorities			0
but while under supervision , @entity6 committed 39 violations , including failure to attend appointments with immigration authorities , according to @entity15			0
@entity29 said her father was overwhelmed with his single - dad duties			0
he did attend his @entity15 appointments , she said , although " it 's possible he arrived a few minutes late			0
but perhaps they counted that a no - show			0
" the siblings represent @entity82 's young legal residents who are at risk for long - term emotional trauma because of a system that does n't deal with the situation			1
about 5,100 @entity82 children in 22 states have lost parents to deportation , according to the @entity91 -- a 30 - year - old racial justice think tank			1
some 15,000 more face similar threat in the next five years			0
these families live in constant fear of deportation as their kids attend school and pledge allegiance to the flag			1
constantly worrying that their parents will be snatched away , children often feel angry , helpless and trapped			1
families like the @entity105 are referred to by the system as " mixed - status families			0
" @entity9 was born in the @entity82			1
@entity29 -- who was born in @entity17 -- lives in the @entity82 legally under the @entity109 program			1
@entity109 grants two - year reprieves from deportation to undocumented youths who came to the @entity82 as children			1
at their father 's request , @entity46 has become the @entity118 ' legal guardian			2
she receives no government funds to offset the cost of raising them			0
making ends meet is n't easy			0
the @entity39 teens rely on whatever their parents can send from @entity17			2
their father -- who works in construction -- says he has had a difficult time finding a job since moving there			0
" we 've had to leave everyone we knew behind , switch schools , and we 're constantly trying to catch up in our new school , " said @entity29			2
in the middle of all the chaos , she 's been juggling paperwork for her immigration status while filing applications to several universities			0
another problem : being under @entity46 's guardianship may threaten @entity7 's ability to qualify for college financial aid			0
" it 's been really stressful doing all this without my parents , " she said			2
" i miss them so much			0
" but the siblings have managed to hold on to a few reminders of their former life : some family photos and their precious @entity154 , @entity155			2
they talk to their parents on the phone every day			2
@entity29 says it does n't come close to having them by her side			0
anguishing decision their behavior has changed since that day in september , @entity46 said			0
at school , the teens keep to themselves and do n't talk much with other kids			1
@entity46 worries they may be depressed and are withdrawing from social interaction			0
experts say repercussions of traumatic experiences like the @entity118 ' can take a serious toll			2
" the psychological effects on these children left behind include depression , possible conduct disorders , and having a constant sense of a diminishing and ambiguous future , " said dr. @entity172 , dean of the @entity173 at the @entity174			1
" no parent should be put through such an anguishing decision of whether or not to leave a child behind , but most importantly , how will these kids feel about their government when they grow up ? " an estimated 340,000 babies born in the @entity82 in 2008 were the children of unauthorized immigrants , according to the @entity189			1
that number is projected to grow			0
on average , 17 children are placed in state care each day as a result of the detention and removal of immigrant parents , according to @entity15			1
some kids are fortunate enough to have other family to stay with , said @entity172			2
others get lost in the child welfare system			0
in some cases , younger children are transferred to state custody and put up for adoption , never to see their parents again			1
in the end , @entity172 warns that the policy threatens to hurt the nation in the long run			0
" what other future does the @entity82 have other than losing a whole generation of kids because of the way their parents were treated ? " torn between two nations desperate to reunite with their parents , @entity29 and @entity218 have considered moving to @entity17 -- an idea opposed by their father , who believes there 's no future for them there			1
the parents left @entity17 in the 1980s because the government , they said , was putting too much emphasis on political indoctrination and social control			1
but the teens ' argument about why they should stay in the @entity82 is this : they feel they are @entity82			1
the @entity82 is their home			1
" i came here when i was 18 months old and i do n't know @entity17 at all , " @entity29 said			0

" i can contribute more here than in @entity17 , " he said			0
@entity57 wishes she could do more to help			0
" but i ca n't replace their parents , " she said			2
she accuses the @entity238 administration of failing to honor its pledge to make parents like the @entity242 less likely to be deported			1
the @entity238 administration stated in 2012 that undocumented immigrants without criminal records would be considered low - priority removals , including those parents of @entity82 - born children with strong ties in the @entity82			1
@entity46 argues that if this were the case , @entity7 and @entity9 would be with their parents today			2
overall , @entity252 questions whether federal officials are committed to making sure children whose parents are deported are properly taken care of			1
" i have yet to receive a call from @entity15 asking if these children are even alive -- yet with a legal guardian , " she said			1
it 's almost impossible to know the full scope of the problem			0
child welfare departments and the federal government are n't required to track cases of families separated by deportation			0
during the past 25 years , @entity46 says she has found homes for about 800 children whose parents have been detained or deported			1
on @entity271 , lawmakers seem to give little attention to the situation			0
some say a bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by @entity276 in 2012 might help			0
supporters say it aims to provide a path to citizenship for the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants , strengthen border security and change the visa system			2
opponents in the @entity286 , many of them @entity287 , reject any reform that involves what they consider " amnesty " for undocumented immigrants			0
in @entity12 , the @entity39 children long to see their parents again			1
and they have n't given up			0
