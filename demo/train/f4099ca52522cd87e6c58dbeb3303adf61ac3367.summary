-- @entity1 has a new book out -- and it 's not what you 'd expect			1
" the @entity13 " is a fun and innovative guide to rejuvenating your sex life and libido , co-written with renowned sex therapist @entity9 ( who writes about sex on @entity0 's medical news blog , @entity12 )			1
the vivacious 48 - year - old actress is married to " @entity15 " actor @entity16 and mother of @entity18 , 13 , and @entity19 , 10			2
she spoke , very honestly , to @entity0 about her own sexual problems and how she got her groove back			2
@entity0 : how did this book come about ? @entity1 : i wrote a book back in 2008 called " @entity25			1
" i spoke very candidly and openly about losing my sex drive and mojo and how i figured out a way to get it back			1
it seemed to really touch people			1
they came up to me and wanted my help			2
so cut to , i met @entity9 , who is a sex therapist , and we got to talking			1
he said , " maybe we should write a book together -- he said , she said			1
" i thought it was a great idea because i feel like not enough people talk about sex , we feel shame about it			1
there 's so much taboo in this country around sex , yet it 's something that is really the glue that holds a marriage together			1
with 50 % of all marriages ending in divorce , i said , " gosh , it needs to get out			2
" @entity0 : how did you get your mojo back ? @entity1 : firstly i set my mind to do it			1
i opened up to my husband			2
i was very afraid to do it			2
i was terrified , and i held it in for so long , until one day i burst into tears , and i told him			0
and he was so very supportive			0
he said , " well , what can we do ? we 'll do whatever we have to do			0
" the next day in the @entity65 there was a piece about pole dancing classes given by an actress named @entity69			0
she created this class to help women get back in touch with their sexuality			0
she taught us how to move in ways that i had never allowed myself to move in			0
what those kinds of things do is they give you permission			0
that led me to a woman who threw sex toy parties			1
she brings out dildos and everyone 's giggling and she teaches you how to give great ( fellatio and masturbation ) -- everything i think a woman needs for confidence , because nobody really teaches you this stuff			0
growing up you 're not really supposed to be doing it , because you 're a bad girl if you do			0
so this was all part of my own sexual awakening			0
even though i lost my sex drive , i did n't have the sexual confidence to begin with , so it happened for a reason			1
so i could really delve into my own sexual exploration			0
@entity0 : what did you discover ? @entity1 : i just know how important it is in keeping a marriage going			1
without it , you 're roommates , you do n't value each other , and boom -- someone 's going to have an affair and get divorced			0
it 's not easy being married ; it 's hard after 20 years ! if you do n't have sex you just want to walk away half the time , so you really need to make the effort			1
@entity0 : who would have thunk , you 're like dr. @entity115 ! @entity1 : i certainly never set out to do any of this			1
i never thought i 'd write a book about sex			1
i 'm not an expert			0
but i have lived through something , and i have been in a marriage for 20 years that has lasted , so i think i have valuable things to say			0
because of @entity9 's expertise it 's an encyclopedia on how to get out of a sex rut , how to take risks in your sex life , how to start a conversation with your partner that you 've been terrified to bring up			1
it 's really about communication			0
i really believe anything two people do behind closed doors , as long as it 's consensual , is ok			2
but you 've got to talk about it and be open			2
i hope this book opens people up to try new things			1
i do n't understand why it 's not ok to do something that makes us feel so good and so connected to another human being			2
it 's a gift , a beautiful gift that our bodies were made to do , and not just for procreation but for enjoyment			0
@entity0 : you and @entity16 seem to have a @entity155 / @entity154 thing going on			0
it 's exactly our relationship , 150 %			0
but he lets me do my thing and supports me			0
he shakes his head and walks out of the room			0
we 're complete opposites but it just works			0
@entity0 : you have two daughters			0
they must have been horrified that you 've written this book			1
@entity1 : up until a few days ago they just knew i 'd written a book about relationships			1
they did n't really know i 'd written a book about sex			1
the other day the book was sitting on the table and my daughter @entity18 comes in , looks down at it and says , " oh , that 's awkward , " and walks out of the room			2
i 'm hoping when they 're adults they can have this book and have a healthy sex life as opposed to waiting until their mid- 30s to try and figure it out			1
we do n't want to have to think about our kids having sex , but they will .			2
