@entity1 , @entity0 -- human rights and freedom of the press in @entity11 , the detention of terrorist suspects by the @entity5 and @entity7 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in @entity15 's annual report , released wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world			1
@entity15 protestors outside the @entity20 in january dressed as @entity22 detainees			2
the 398 - page report comes 60 years after the @entity24 adopted the @entity25 , and @entity15 says governments still need to act on their promises			1
" the biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership , " the organization said in a statement			0
@entity36 , @entity15 's secretary - general , said that in particular , " the human - rights flash points in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 demand immediate attention			1
" the report , the group said , " reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression			1
" according to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries			1
of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , @entity15 paid particular attention to @entity11 , the host of this summer 's @entity62			1
the group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in @entity11 in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including @entity67 , @entity69 practitioners and @entity70 -- repressed or persecuted			0
death penalty statistics in @entity11 are difficult to assess , @entity15 said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007			1
@entity15 also noted the repression of free speech in @entity11 and said censorship of the @entity78 and other media intensified last year			2
" the @entity11 authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information , " the report said			0
" they decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives			0
the authorities continued to block web sites and to filter internet content based on specified words and topics			0
" around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , @entity15 said			0
@entity15 also criticized the death penalty in the @entity5 , where 42 people were executed last year			1
it noted @entity102 's decision in december to abolish the death penalty made it the first @entity5 state in more than 40 years to do away with executions			1
as it has in previous annual reports , @entity15 criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the @entity5 naval base at @entity22 , @entity110			1
" the @entity5 must close @entity22 detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill - treatment , " @entity15 said			1
the group noted that @entity22 detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to @entity5 courts			0
most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum - security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , @entity15 said			0
in fact , more is written on the @entity5 than any other country listed in the report			1
asked about that at a press conference tuesday , @entity133 said , " we certainly devote a lot of time to @entity139 , to @entity11 , to @entity39 and other countries			2
but we look to the @entity5 to provide leadership around the world			2
governments around the world look to the @entity5 as a role model for their own behavior			2
" in a lengthy section on @entity41 , @entity15 noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007			1
" all sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity , " the report said			0
abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million @entity41 to flee to @entity165 , @entity166 and elsewhere , @entity15 said			1
@entity5 forces held some 25,000 detainees " without charge or trial , " the group said , and 33 people were executed , " some after grossly unfair trials			2
" in @entity178 , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to " large - scale displacement " of people throughout the year			0
" at least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict , " the report said			0
" violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including @entity178 and international security forces and insurgent groups			0
" @entity7 must show greater tolerance for political dissent , @entity15 said			0
" the @entity7 authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ' unpatriotic , ' " the report said			0
" a crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run - up to the @entity200 [ parliament ] elections in december			0
" the @entity203 ruled that @entity7 was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in @entity209 , @entity15 said			2
there were fewer reported disappearances in the @entity209 in 2007 than in previous years , @entity15 said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses			1
the report also criticized human rights conditions in @entity217 , @entity40 and @entity42			1
human rights conditions in @entity39 continued to decline in 2007 , the report said , " with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression			1
" members of the main opposition party , the @entity228 , along with other human rights defenders , were arrested , and many were tortured while in custody , @entity15 said			0
some 4 million people required food aid because of the nation 's deteriorating economy , and victims of forced evictions in 2005 continued to live in " deplorable conditions " while president @entity240 's government failed to remedy their situation			2
" human rights problems are not isolated tragedies , but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly , endangering all of us , " @entity133 said			0
" governments today must show the same degree of vision , courage and commitment that led the @entity24 to adopt the @entity25 60 years ago			0
