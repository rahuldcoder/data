-- an appeals court ruling has raised the possibility that @entity4 women will be able to seek asylum in the @entity6 because of the high rates of femicide in that country			1
a @entity4 woman seeking asylum based on her belief that she would not be safe in her native country will have her case reviewed , the @entity10 ruled monday			1
@entity15 , a native of @entity4 who entered the @entity6 illegally as a teenager to join her mother in 1991 , was facing deporation in 2003			1
she requested asylum " because she feared persecution as a member of a particular social group consisting of women between the ages of fourteen and forty , " according to the court document			1
in particular , @entity15 argued that women in @entity4 " were murdered at a high rate with impunity			2
" an immigration judge denied her claim , and the @entity31 upheld the decision			0
monday 's ruling remands the case to the @entity31 for further proceedings			0
@entity15 , who lives in @entity36 , @entity37 , and works as a @entity39 account executive at a medical facility there , is not assured asylum , but the decision gives her and countless other @entity4 women the possibility of remaining in the @entity6			1
a key issue in the case is whether @entity4 women are too broad of a group to be considered a protected " particular social group " eligible for asylum			1
that 's what the @entity31 decided when it upheld the immigration judge 's ruling , calling it " merely a demographic division ... rather than a particular social group			0
" the three - judge panel at the appeals court , however , found that the decision was " inconsistent with its own precedent and this court 's case law			0
" it is important to note that the appeals court stopped short of saying @entity15 deserved asylum , only saying that she was eligible for it , @entity66 , @entity67 of the @entity68 , told @entity0			1
proving that @entity15 will face persecution if she is returned to @entity4 and that the country does n't protect its young women will be hard to prove , he said			0
any other @entity4 women hoping to take advantage of this week 's ruling will have to do the same			2
" i do n't think there 's going to be a flood of @entity4 women applying for asylum tomorrow , " @entity66 said			2
" this is part of a trend among @entity6 courts to ensure women are afforded protection under asylum laws			0
" according to @entity87 , between 2001 and 2006 , more than 1,900 @entity4 women and girls were killed			0
many of those killings involved sexual violence and " exceptional cruelty , " the organization said .			0

an appeals court remanded the case of a @entity4 woman seeking asylum in the @entity6
@entity15 argues that because of high murder rates for women , she is not safe going home
ruling could affect other @entity4 women in the @entity6
a key issue is whether being a woman constitutes a protected social group
