@entity0 may not be the first place to spring to mind when it comes to fine wine , but the country 's tradition of viticulture stretches back for centuries			1
@entity0 has produced wine throughout its history , but its popularity waned after phylloxera , a pest which also heavily affected @entity15 wine production in the 19th century , ravaged many of the subcontinent 's vineyards			1
however , one man is on a quest to get @entity0 drinking the grape nectar once again			2
@entity23 's journey to becoming a winemaker has been unusual -- he studied engineering at @entity26 and got a high - flying job at @entity28 after graduating			1
however , he left it all behind to return to his father 's birthplace , @entity32 , a city in western @entity0 , and started experimenting with different vines			1
" i just noticed that @entity32 was full of grapes , and no one was making wine in this beautiful place , " he says			0
initially , @entity23 had a modest goal -- to merely produce wine that was pleasant and drinkable			2
however , with the help of a noted @entity42 winemaker @entity41 , he soon realized that the terroir had the potential for much more			2
" things went to a different level			0
we started from selling just 40,000 bottles of wine to something like 10 million bottles of wine ... and it 's a beautiful business that has brought not just profit to us but to the greater community at large , " he says			0
international acclaim @entity23 's @entity57 were the first in @entity0 to be featured in @entity59 , a respected industry magazine , in 2002			1
today , @entity60 is @entity0 's top wine producer , holding about 65 % of the country 's wine market			1
the entrepreneur 's gamble proved successful , but what had made him abandon a prestigious @entity68 job and throw himself into a new venture ? " i really wanted to do something that i was really passionate about when i wake up every day , and that was something that i was n't feeling in my corporate job			2
i strapped on a backpack and just started moving across the world , landing up here in @entity32			0
" there is a world of difference between the way i feel now about what i 'm doing , full of passion , compared to what i used to do			0
every day i 'm so excited to take on the challenges			0
it 's my baby , it 's as simple as that , " he says .			0
