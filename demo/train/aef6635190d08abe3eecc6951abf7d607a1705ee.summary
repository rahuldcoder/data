what if @entity0 spent $ 19 billion on something and most people never noticed ? the social media giant dropped that mind - boggling amount wednesday on @entity7 , paying 19 times more than it did for @entity8 for a texting app that most folks in the @entity14 had never even heard of			1
so what will this mean for the average @entity0 user , or fans of @entity7 , which lets users send unlimited messages for no more than 99 cents a year ? in the hours after the deal became public , the prevailing opinion appeared to be , " not much			1
" " @entity7 will continue to operate independently within @entity0 , " ceo @entity22 wrote wednesday			1
" the product roadmap will remain unchanged and the team is going to stay in @entity25 , " the suburban @entity27 city where it 's based			0
@entity22 also said that @entity28 , @entity0 's chat app , and @entity7 will remain separate			1
so what 's the deal ? well , first , @entity0 has demonstrated a willingness to scoop up successful mobile apps ( a space where it 's weak compared to rivals @entity37 and @entity38 , with their own operating systems and stores ) then largely leave them alone			2
witness @entity8 , which @entity0 bought in 2012 for $ 1 billion			1
active users were wary of the buyout , with some threatening to leave			0
since then , the photo app 's number of active users has more than doubled , even with the carefully crafted introduction of ads , which some people feared would junk up @entity8 's user experience			2
@entity7 has 450 million active users worldwide and is reportedly adding millions more each month on a path @entity22 and others believe will soon have it hitting the 1 billion mark			1
and that 's probably where @entity0 is really looking			2
while it may be lightly regarded in the @entity14 , where unlimited texting plans are the norm , @entity7 has taken off in emerging markets like @entity61 , where traditional text - messaging can get expensive			2
@entity7 is free to download and costs a mere 99 cents per year after the first year			0
" ( @entity67 ) here 's no other homegrown technology company that 's so widely loved overseas and so under appreciated at home , " wrote @entity64 of @entity65 , the primary investor in @entity7			1
with growth beginning to plateau in the @entity14 , @entity0 obviously is looking to places like @entity61 to keep growing			0
@entity22 also believes @entity7 will help with the company 's internet.org initiative -- an effort to provide web access to the two - thirds of the world 's population that does n't yet have it			1
" our mission is to make the world more open and connected , " he wrote			0
" we do this by building services that help people share any type of content with any group of people they want			0
@entity7 will help us do this by continuing to develop a service that people around the world love to use every day			0
" bringing in @entity7 also creates a whole new brain trust for @entity0 as it develops future mobile products			1
for a while , @entity0 struggled with how to make money in the emerging mobile landscape			0
investors have increasingly warmed to its stock as the company has shown more and more comfort in the mobile space , where an ever increasing number of users access its products			0
so , if all signs point to @entity0 remaining @entity0 and @entity7 remaining @entity7 , there 's not much for users to be concerned about , right ? well			1
have you ever been on the @entity111 ? the move was met with predictable skepticism , much like the 2012 @entity8 buyout and , really , almost any time a beloved tech startup gets gobbled up by one of the industry 's big - money behemoths			0
" @entity0 is like an evil parent that keeps finding the new hiding place for your diary , " @entity120 user @entity119 wrote , referring to the site 's habit of buying out emerging communication tools			2
" @entity0 bought # @entity7 ... please be checking the security settings now ... too many scandals are about to break out			1
damn ! " added @entity130 , a journalist from @entity61 's @entity131			0
joked @entity132 , a dj with @entity134 radio station @entity133 : " waking up to the news that @entity22 now owns all your nudes			0

@entity0 's major purchase might not change much for users
the company *shelled* out $ 19 billion for texting tool *whatsapp*
@entity22 says @entity7 will operate independently
move looks to help @entity0 abroad , where @entity7 is strong
