-- @entity1 is fixing her deep brown eyes on me			1
she gently takes my hand and leads me across @entity7 's @entity6 's marble floor , to a window whose white blinds are obscuring the greenery of @entity11 beyond			1
she places her hand reassuringly on my back and whispers : " ten minutes like this			0
" frankly , if she had asked me to stay there forever , i would have probably agreed			0
i have been charmed by the self - styled grandmother of performance art. the legendary @entity21 - born @entity20 - based artist is in @entity7 for the biggest show of her career , and she is revealing a small glimpse of it to a room full of enchanted international journalists			1
entitled 512 hours , the exhibition will see @entity1 in residence at the @entity6 for 64 days , spending eight hours a day with no breaks trying to create art out of nothing			1
the museum walls have been stripped , and there are some folding chairs and beds which she may or may not use in storage , but essentially , @entity1 is relying purely on an exchange of energy with her audience			2
" it took me 25 years to gather courage , concentration and knowledge to come to this " the formidable artist says , clad in an almost monastic outfit of black high - neck shirt , long overcoat and dark trousers			0
" it 's difficult to say what i 'm going to do because i do n't know			0
what i do know is that in this piece i have to give not 100 , but 120 per cent of myself , because only then i can create energy out of empty space			1
" if this seems like an audacious proposal , @entity1 has managed to do something similar with aplomb before			2
for her 2010 retrospective at the @entity64 in @entity20 , over 850,000 people queued day and night just to sit opposite her , many breaking down in tears when finally faced with her			1
mesmerizing appeal it 's hard to think of another artist who can draw monumental crowds with such an airy concept , but after spending half an hour with @entity1 , you start to see the pull			1
strikingly beautiful in the flesh and looking two decades younger than her 67 years , she exudes a mesmerizing mix of hypnotic energy , reassuring warmth and sharp wit			0
even so , what makes people from all walks of life , as seen in @entity20 , wait for hours just to be in her presence ? " connection , " says @entity85 , co-director of the @entity6 , who first invited @entity1 to stage a show after she won the @entity87 at the @entity88 in 1997			1
" when we grow older we lose that connection with other people , and @entity92 helps us regain it through her			0
" in a career spanning over 40 years , @entity1 has constantly challenged the notions of what art should be , using her body as an instrument , and sometimes risking her life in the process			1
she has lain inside a burning star of sawdust , had a crossbow pointed to her heart , and even allowed the audience to prod and cut her naked body as she lay motionless			0
" every performance has a concept , and when i set out the rules i stick to them no matter what , " the artist told me over the phone when i interviewed her about the @entity114 , a space she is creating in @entity116 , @entity20 , for development and study of performance art. " even if in the end i do n't survive , i do n't care , " she says			1
iron willpower this steely resolve could be attributed to her upbringing in @entity125 , as the daughter of two national heroes ordained for bravery			0
her family valued achievement above all , and household rules were strict : " until i was 29 years old and left home i had a curfew of 10 pm , so all my performances had to be done by that time			0
" i think i inherited self - control and discipline from my parents , and the idea that your personal life is n't important , but that what you achieve matters , " she explained in her thick @entity143 accent , only slightly softened by the years she has spent abroad			0
however , her ascetic approach to her craft has not stopped her from being the darling of the celebrity art circuit			0
she has danced with @entity151 in his music video , counts @entity153 and @entity154 as loyal fans and friends , and was named as one of @entity159 's most influential people of 2014			1
these mainstream accolades have led some critics to accuse @entity1 of losing her avant - garde edge , a judgment that does n't seem to faze her : " i stepped out of an art context into a much larger context , but if anything , i have become more radical			2
at my age i should be having a nice retrospective , go on holidays , but instead , i decided to push myself like never before and create art out of nothing , it 's not easy you know , " she says laughing			1
it takes less than 10 minutes in her company to see that for @entity1 , art and life are one thing			2
even the act of breaking up with her lover and collaborator of many years @entity179 was a performance -- they both walked the @entity185 from opposite directions , meeting for one final embrace in the middle			0
her unconventional lifestyle has left little place for other people in her world , but you get the sense that the way she lives is less of a choice and more of a necessity : " i wake up every day with so many ideas , and the desire to create is as strong as the need to breathe			2
for me , art is my cause , " the formidable artist tells me			2
for those who have hoped to snap a selfie with the grand dame at her @entity210 show , bitter disappointment awaits -- @entity1 is asking her audience to leave their gadgets at home : " i do n't want people to blog or tweet it without experiencing it			1
the now is the only reality we have in our lives , " she says			0
it seems that at a time when the pace of life threatens to engulf us , @entity1 wants us to slow down and live in the present			2
