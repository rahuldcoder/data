it 's an iconic piece of video			2
for more than three minutes , a mob of enraged men toss @entity4 around like a broken mannequin			1
his body and face bloody , his black bushy hair a crazy mess , the 69 - year - old @entity11 leader is pummeled			1
his shirt is ripped open to reveal a pudgy belly			0
the cell phone camera then focuses on a gulf of red spreading across @entity4 's backside as someone stabs him in the rear with a bayonet			1
later , a young man holds a golden pistol triumphantly in the air as he 's cheered by the mob in @entity26 , @entity11			1
it did n't take long before the video was uploaded to the @entity29 , where the world watched the violent end to @entity11 's eight - month uprising in 2011 -- and to @entity4 's life			1
to critics of the long - ruling dictator , it appeared to be a fitting conclusion			2
but human rights investigators now say there 's much more to what happened on october 20 last year than rebels acting in the heat of the moment			1
@entity44 says the militiamen who ravaged @entity4 also captured , tortured and killed dozens of his loyalists following his death , violating international war crimes laws			1
that assertion is laid out in a 50 - page report released by @entity44 this week			1
the rights group based its findings on witness accounts and amateur videos shot with cell phones			2
in its report , @entity44 lambastes @entity11 's current transitional government , saying it has taken no serious steps in investigating or prosecuting @entity61 militias			1
it also says its findings do not match @entity11 's assertion that @entity4 was killed in the crossfire , and not after his capture			1
@entity44 called on @entity11 's leaders to honor their pledge formally and investigate @entity4 's death			1
@entity68 has reached out to @entity11 authorities for comment on the @entity44 report , but has not received a response			1
if @entity11 is going to truly rid itself of violence and extremists -- a timely demand considering last month 's fatal @entity77 consulate attack -- justice , the group believes , must be meted out on all sides			1
@entity4 and crew run in february 2011 , protesters took to the streets in @entity11 demanding peacefully that @entity4 step down			1
his 42 years of hardline rule had to end , they said			0
a man who rarely embraced reality , @entity4 retorted , " all my people ... love me			1
" as rallies continued , @entity4 responded by ordering his forces to fire into the crowds			1
the movement descended into a violent uprising that dragged on for months			2
by march , the opposition gained a foothold in the city of @entity96			0
in response , @entity4 's forces closed in on the city			1
at the @entity101 , the @entity100 passed a resolution imposing a no - fly zone over @entity11 and authorized the use of " all necessary measures " -- except an occupation -- to protect civilians from the violence raging in their country			1
in august , as @entity112 looked ever more fragile , @entity4 , his crew and his sons jumped into cars and sped off in various directions			1
@entity115 , active in his father 's regime , was killed in a @entity119 airstrike as he tried to skip town			1
another son , @entity121 , managed to make his way to the @entity124 suburb of @entity125 , surrounded by desert			0
@entity127 later told @entity44 that a @entity119 airstrike had left him mildly wounded			1
he was captured in november near @entity11 's border			1
national security adviser @entity130 , another son , made it safely to @entity26 , his father 's hometown			2
that 's also where the dictator and his crew headed			1
senior security adviser @entity136 was in tow , he told @entity44 , as well as @entity4 's personal guard , driver and a bunch of other bodyguards			1
@entity11 's intelligence chief was there , but only briefly , because he was dispatched hundreds of miles to the south of @entity26			1
his job ? he had to tell @entity115 ' mother that her son was dead			0
from luxury to squatting for some time , @entity4 and his inner circle stayed in the middle of the city			1
but as the fighting intensified , they began moving from empty house to empty house , eating the food left in the cupboards , @entity136 said			1
the homes they sought shelter in had already been looted			0
as the weeks wore on , food was sparse			2
the medicine they had was running out			0
it was getting tougher to find water			0
this group , who once dined in luxury , was subsisting on pasta and rice			0
" living ( was ) very hard ... we did n't even have bread , " @entity136 recounted			0
@entity4 spent most of his time reading the @entity174 and praying			1
" his communications with the world was cut off ... no television , nothing , " @entity136 said			0
maybe we could use the ( satellite phone ) and get some news from @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 or @entity185 24			0
i mean , ( we ) could call people who watch those channels			0
" we had no duties , " he said			0
" we were just between sleeping and being awake			0
" the militias hunting @entity4 were getting closer			1
and the dictator was getting moodier			2
" ( he was ) becoming more and more angry , " @entity136 said			0
" mostly he was angry about the lack of electricity , communications , and television , his inability to communicate with the outside world			0
" the men would sit with @entity4 and try to calm him down			1
" why is there no electricity ? " he screamed at them			0
" why is there no water ? " a doomed escape by mid-october , @entity130 , one of the two surviving sons , decided enough was enough			2
he told the group in @entity26 to meet at an ad - hoc clinic			0
they were going to try to escape			2
the plan was to break out around 3:30 or 4 a.m. but it took until about 8 a.m. to load the supplies and the men who were wounded			0
by that time , @entity61 militia fighters had returned to their fighting positions			0
odds were stacked against the convoy , not least of all because it was unwieldy , including some 250 people			0
when it set out , it came under heavy attack			0
it swerved and snaked onto dirt roads			0
a missile struck so close to the convoy that airbags in some of the vehicles inflated , @entity136 said			0
disoriented and out of options , @entity4 's men drove right into a militia base			1
as @entity119 jets flew overhead , the vehicles were trapped			0
munitions inside the convoy were triggered by the firepower all around			0
explosions shook @entity4 's crew from the convoy and they ran for their lives			1
@entity240 , the son of @entity4 's defense minister , was among several who ran to a villa and took cover			1
when he got there , he saw @entity4 hiding , wearing a helmet and bulletproof vest			2
the dictator had a handgun in his pocket and was carrying an automatic weapon , @entity240 and another witness told @entity44			1
shots picked away at the concrete			0
@entity130 was injured but he still called the shots			0
he ordered the men to make a run for it , and motioned toward a drainage pipe near a main road several hundred feet away			2
@entity130 turned to his father			0
" i will try and find you a way out of here , " he promised			0
once they made it to the pipe , fighters ran toward the group			0
@entity4 's guard threw a grenade at them			1
it bounced off the concrete and back at them			2
the mob descends shrapnel sliced @entity4			1
@entity136 saw that the leader 's head was bleeding			1
but he was more concerned with his father , who was also with the group			0
he 'd fallen to the ground			0
" i ran towards my father , but he did n't answer when i asked him if he was okay , " @entity136 told @entity44			2
@entity240 , the son of @entity4 's defense minister , was fatally injured			1
exposed , the group was overrun by militia fighters			0
the 3 - minute , 38 - second cell phone clip that seems to show the last moments of @entity4 's life is choppy			1
whoever was filming moves the camera around dizzily in the chaos			0
but the audio is clear			0
the mob shouts " @entity296 ! " or " @entity297 is the greatest ! " they chant " @entity124 , " the name of the town where hatred of @entity4 burned most intensely during the uprising , primarily because his army had shelled it nonstop for two months in the spring			1
to understand precisely what shelling means here , imagine the kind of @entity308 firework that shoots up to the sky in a single rocket and then bursts into a thousand pieces in the sky			0
if you were on the ground in @entity124 , it was like that , only in reverse , a thousand tiny death pellets careening in all directions at speeds impossible to run from			2
scores of innocent people were killed there , and even if they survived the shelling , there was n't much hope			2
it was next to impossible to get medical aid , food and other supplies there			2
it was the militias of @entity124 that brutalized @entity4 loyalists the worst , the rights group says			2
the group also alleges it has evidence that indicates opposition militias took @entity130 from @entity26 to @entity124 and killed him , and it has cell phone video taken by opposition fighters showing captured convoy members being abused , the group said in its report			2
@entity44 matched morgue pictures with video of men executed together in a hotel			2
@entity44 had investigators inside @entity11 the day @entity4 died			1
the team documented more than 100 bodies and wrote in the wednesday report that the bodies lingered for a while but were later buried by volunteers			0
the rights group alleges that no @entity11 investigators have attempted to document how many people died , who killed them and how			1
the problem , @entity44 says , is twofold			2
first , those militias from @entity124 are still quite active			0
today , they are preventing about 30,000 people from returning to their homes in the area , for example			0
second , the country 's transitional government perceives them as undermining governmental authority , the rights group said			0
suspicion -- rather than order and forgiveness -- continues to grip @entity11 , the rights group suggests , and justice is being ignored .			2

@entity44 : @entity11 should investigate rebels who killed @entity4 forces
witness in @entity4 inner circle describes dictator on the run , eating food in empty houses
trying to escape , the leader 's guards threw grenades but one bounced back and exploded
a mob descended on @entity4 october 20 , but it 's still *unclear* how he died , @entity44 says
