@entity0 , @entity1 -- for his first event in @entity1 on thursday , sen. @entity3 agreed to do some phone - banking at @entity8 candidate @entity7 's headquarters in @entity0			1
the @entity10 @entity9 sat down at a long table , where he was flanked by the state 's @entity9 chairwoman @entity12 and @entity7 's wife , @entity14 , who were also making calls			2
@entity7 , who @entity3 endorsed at a separate event last month , was out of town			1
nine journalists — roughly half with cameras — gathered quietly in front of @entity3 to observe			1
@entity3 : @entity22 is ' not like @entity23 ' no one answered @entity3 's first phone call , and an aide from the headquarters stepped in to dial out to the next person			1
the same thing happened after the second			2
after the third , the aide had briefly looked away and did n't immediately jump in to redial			0
" alright , let 's keep going , " @entity3 said , looking around and sounding agitated			1
" who 's helping me ? " the aide quickly returned to the phone and pressed the right buttons			2
@entity3 seemed puzzled that the system did n't do that on its own , and it was becoming clear that those few seconds of entering new numbers were becoming a waste of time			1
@entity43 , @entity7 pair up after 2012 pause the doctor in him had a solution			0
" i just thought of a software update for you , " he said , suggesting they use a program that automatically calls the next name on a list after an unsuccessful attempt			0
he repeated his prescription to @entity56			0
the phone - banking marked an example of @entity3 's no - frills , straight - to - the - chase personality			1
he 's not one to make jokes or put on a smile in awkward moments just to fill space			0
in a stark contrast to the effusive styles of many politicians , he 's indeed eager to " keep going " and unafraid to show impatience at times			0
that 's in part because he maintains an aggressive , fast - paced schedule , crisscrossing the country to campaign for 2014 candidates and raise his national profile as he prepares a potential presidential bid			1
his visit thursday — a campaign - style , four - city blitz across the state -- was his fourth time to @entity1 since early last year			1
with its first - in - the - nation primary status , the state is a big attraction for @entity86 hopefuls			1
another few calls went unanswered thursday morning , and each time the aide stepped in to help			2
@entity3 would sit back in his chair cross-legged with every call , staring down blankly at the table as the media looked on			1
" we 're going to have to plan ahead before we get to the next office , " @entity56 said , with a slightly frustrated tone			0
she then recommended that he just leave a message , but @entity3 did n't like the idea			1
after the eighth attempt , he lowered the phone			2
" @entity56 decided to try something else			0
she took over his phone and called someone whose number she knew by memory and who she described as an undecided voter			2
but she did n't get through			0
she had to dial out again			0
this time it did n't ring			2
the aide came back to help redial			0
" ok , you 're not going to talk to anyone this morning , " @entity56 laughed nervously to @entity3			1
" put me back on the random thing , " he said			0
" i 'm going to eventually get someone			0
" he cracked a slight smile that seemed to bring some relief to the situation			0
they urged him to leave a voicemail again , but he refused			0
then , suddenly : " hey is this @entity122 ? this is @entity3 , how are you doing ? " having reached someone on his twelfth call , he made his pitch for @entity7			1
a former @entity129 senator from @entity130 who was defeated by @entity131 in 2012 , @entity7 is running for the @entity8 again , this time from neighboring @entity1 where he had a vacation home			1
he officially moved to the state less then a year ago			2
" i do n't know exactly what made his decision as far as relocating here , " @entity3 said , answering an apparent question from the voter about @entity7 's transition			2
the attack on @entity7 as a carpetbagger is a strategy used by @entity7 's opponent , @entity145 sen. @entity144 , in what 's become an expensive and competitive race			0
" i know he 's had a lot of roots here , " @entity3 continued , before spelling out @entity7 's connections to the state			1
@entity3 went on to describe @entity7 as an " honest " man and talked up the former senator 's economic positions			2
he hung up after they spoke for several minutes , only to find that he had to punch yet more buttons , telling the system whether the voter was still undecided or not			0
" alright , i finally got through to somebody , " he said , appearing satisfied			0
" did you convince them ? " asked @entity14 , @entity7 's wife			0
" well , " he said , lingering with reluctance , " they 're still undecided			0
" at the end of the 13 - minute ordeal , he stood up and issued his recommendation to the aide for a fourth time : " if you can figure out how that can go automatically ... it could have gone a little faster , " @entity3 said			1
" but also maybe your younger people who can see the phone are better at it than me , " he joked , drawing a laugh out of the aide while @entity3 grabbed his upper arm — politician style — to say goodbye			1
@entity3 , @entity56 and @entity7 drove about 20 minutes to the next stop in @entity181 , where they would phone - bank once again			1
this time , someone was on the other line for @entity3 's first call .			1

@entity3 was in @entity1 for the fourth time since early last year .
the state is a must - stop for presidential hopefuls .
this time he was campaigning for other candidates in the state before the *midterms* .
his day got off to a slow start with a phone - banking experience .
