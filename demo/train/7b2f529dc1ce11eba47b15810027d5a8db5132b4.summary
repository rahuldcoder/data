-- for everyone licking their wounds after thursday 's landmark 5 - 4 @entity6 decision in @entity7 v. the @entity8 , worried that the evil corporations are now poised to ruin @entity11 democracy once and for all , in the bogus name of free speech , here 's a word of potential hope : i used to be one of you , too , and today i 'm happy as a clam			1
maybe you can be too , eventually			0
here 's why : free speech really does mean free speech , and the laws that the " citizens " ruling overturned directly and heinously restricted the stuff			1
forget for the moment the broad characterization of the ruling -- such as the @entity30 claim that it " sweep [ s ] aside a century - old understanding " -- and drill down to the individual case in question			0
@entity7 , a conservative 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) nonprofit that has funded a dozen political documentaries over the years , produced a critical documentary about @entity38 in 2008 entitled " @entity38 : the movie			0
" by a decision of the federal government , which was enforcing the @entity44 ( known more broadly as @entity44 ) , this piece of political speech was banned from television			1
ireporter : @entity6 ends real democracy let 's boil it down to the essential words : political documentary , banned , government			1
you do n't have to be a @entity55 purist to intuit that political speech was , if anything , the most urgent subcategory covered by the @entity55 's " @entity59 shall pass no law " restrictions			1
and you do n't have to be a @entity38 - hater to imagine the shoe on the other foot			0
what if @entity67 's @entity66 ( 4 ) , campaign to defend @entity11 , had been blocked by @entity69 's @entity8 from broadcasting " @entity44 : @entity70 " ? would n't that stink , too ? as justice @entity72 wrote in his majority opinion , " the law before us is an outright ban , backed by criminal sanctions			2
section 441b makes it a felony for all corporations -- including nonprofit advocacy corporations -- either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election			0
... if the @entity55 has any force , it prohibits @entity59 from fining or jailing citizens , or associations of citizens , for simply engaging in political speech			0
" we are living in a fragmented media age in which many nontraditional sources are producing journalism , even and especially of the advocacy variety ( my opinion magazine , @entity100 , is funded by a nonprofit 501 ( c ) ( 3 )			2
why should nonprofit journalism producers -- like the @entity104 , say -- have to ask for the government 's permission to send a political documentary across the airwaves ? for many liberals i know , the free - speech objection to campaign - finance law is just a smokescreen for enabling corporate villainy			1
i mean , @entity114 cares about the @entity55 ? i used to think that way , too			0
but try this exercise : check out the free - speech objections by people who do n't want @entity119 to take over the @entity120 , or @entity121 to bulldoze private residences			1
i 'm talking about anti-corporatist crusaders like @entity124 , anti-eminent domain - abuse litigators like the @entity126 , or even former @entity8 chief @entity127			0
and for those many who claim to be @entity55 absolutists while also supporting @entity44 -- i 'm looking at you , some of my fellow journalists -- here 's a question that the former begs of the latter : what if you 're wrong ? even if you just ca n't bring yourself to believe that people who take civil liberties seriously have long - held serious civil libertarian criticisms of campaign - finance laws , or if you simply think they 're all wrong , i 'll offer this last salve : it has never been easier for groups of citizens to swarm together and flow money through the internet toward campaigns and candidates who excite them			1
ask @entity151 -- or more relevantly , @entity152 -- what 's more powerful : $ 10 million from dr. @entity154 , or $ 10 each from 1 million people who can actually vote ? the @entity11 people are not sheep , eager to be led by the highest bidder			2
as the @entity6 rightly noted today , " @entity55 confirms the freedom to think for ourselves			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity6 ruling does n't represent a step backward , says @entity164
he says the ruling stops government from *inhibiting* free speech about politics
@entity164 says people are n't sheep ; can make decisions about campaign advertising
he says ruling will allow wide variety of advocacy groups to air points of view
