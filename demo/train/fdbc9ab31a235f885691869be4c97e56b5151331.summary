@entity0 , @entity1 -- after weeks of negotiations with the government , @entity2 's @entity4 show has been granted access to the controversial @entity9 diamond fields in eastern @entity1			1
some experts believe that @entity11 is the largest diamond discovery in generations but the find has been dogged by allegations of human rights abuses and corruption going right to the heart of @entity20 's government			1
there are four diamond companies operating in the area			1
with a large delegation of government minders in tow , @entity2 was first taken to visit @entity27			1
it is exclusively owned by the state - run company , the @entity28 ( @entity30 )			0
high voltage barbed wire fences surround the diamond mines and the processing plant 's equipment			1
several full body searches are done as you get closer to the sorting area where the diamonds are picked from the dirt			0
to avoid " leakages " , as it is called - or , in other words , worker theft -- the diamonds are kept in a glass case and the sorters use gloves to drop the diamonds into an underground vault			1
the company says at no point in the extraction process does a human being touch any of the diamonds			1
the mining manager of @entity27 , @entity55 , tells @entity2 that " between our three plants we can produce a minimum of 200,000 carats every month			1
" all four mining companies - @entity11 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 - have been certified to sell their diamonds on the international market by the @entity65			1

but despite the intense criticism of the @entity9 diamond fields , one of the two monitors of the @entity65 -- the @entity77 protocol to certify origin of the gems and curtail trafficking of " blood diamonds " to fund militant groups - said he has seen significant improvements			1
" you could not find a bigger transition than that one , " @entity84 told @entity2 in @entity85			2
" this is not a granny that is digging with an old shovel in a pit or something -- that happened in 2007 , 2008 , which was when the problems started			0
you are talking about now top - notch diamond companies that are using state - of - the - art equipment			2
" the @entity100 - run company @entity99 has been one of the most heavily criticized companies operating in the field			0
global witness claims that this 50 - 50 partnership between a @entity100 engineering firm and the state owned @entity30 has " board members including senior serving and retired military and police officers			0
" they argue that this " creates opportunities for off budget funding of the security sector " and " a real risk of these revenues being used to finance violence during a future election " in the country			0

" well , when we say things have improved it simply means the violence has certainly ended " @entity130 of @entity125 told @entity2			2
" there is no longer much torture , and the forced labor has come to an end , but why has this taken place ? it is because the army has gained pretty much most of the control of the fields			0
" @entity2 confronted @entity1 director of @entity99 , @entity144 , with these allegations			1
" in @entity1 , boards are made up of all its citizens , " @entity144 said			2
" with @entity61 and all other companies , they are free to bring in persons with different skills and backgrounds			0
so really it is not like @entity61 is a military ( controlled ) area , it is a civilian company operating like any other			0
" the chairman of @entity30 , @entity156 , told @entity2 that there is nothing wrong with serving military figures connected to the ruling @entity160 being on the boards of these mining companies			1
" there is nothing wrong with them sitting on some of the boards , they are @entity1 , they are entitled to sit on those boards			2
" when asked which military figures were connected with these companies , he replied : " when you deal with sensitive issues , particularly in the background of sanctions against us , if you look at the sensitivity of that area , and the attack that is against @entity1 on the assumption that everything that goes there is for the benefit of @entity160 , it is obviously important that we protect the national interest "			1
but despite these mines getting the green light from the @entity65 , the @entity192 's so - called " restrictive measures " and @entity190 government sanctions remain in place			2
according to ambassador @entity199 , speaking to @entity2 's @entity195 in her first interview as the new @entity190 chair of the @entity65 , sanctions have been imposed because " these entities are undermining democracy and democratic institutions			2
" @entity203 is the project manager of @entity62 , another mining company operating in the fields			0
the @entity190 sanctions anger him			0
" it was actually quite shocking that sanctions would be slapped on us even though we are fully compliant by the @entity65 , " @entity203 says			0
" so for us we just continue doing our business and doing our thing , and that is the end of it			0
" " sanctions or no sanctions diamonds get sold to clients all over the world , be it @entity219 , be it @entity221 , be it @entity223 , be it customers in @entity226			0
they come from all over			0
you have the product available , they will come , they will pay their money for it and they will take it			0

@entity2 granted exclusive access to the controversial @entity9 diamond fields
high voltage barbed wire fences surround the diamond mines , where workers are searched
four @entity1 companies now can sell their diamonds on the international market
the human rights organization @entity68 called the decision " shocking "
