-- republicans raised the question in their convention of whether the country is better off than it was when president @entity6 was elected , and it does n't seem that @entity7 have a convincing argument going into their convention this week			1
both @entity11 presidential candidate @entity10 and his running mate @entity12 had a variation on the theme in their acceptance speeches last week in @entity16 , @entity17			2
@entity10 : " this president can not tell us that you 're better off today than when he took office			0
" @entity12 : " without a change in leadership , why would the next four years be any different from the last four years ? " one prominent @entity24 said the answer to the question was " no. " " but that 's not the question of this election , " @entity28 gov. @entity27 said on @entity29 on sunday			1
" the question , without a doubt , we are not as well off as we were before @entity35 brought us the @entity35 job losses , the @entity35 recession , the @entity35 deficits , the series of desert wars -- charged for the first time to credit cards , the national credit cards			1
" republicans pounced on @entity27 's admission , with @entity12 issuing a statement saying it was proof that @entity6 's policies are n't working			1
two of @entity6 's senior advisers would n't give a yes or no answer when asked on sunday			1
while @entity6 senior campaign adviser @entity52 told @entity53 , " we 're in a better position than we were four years ago , " he did n't directly answer the question if voters thought they were better off			1
" i think the average @entity57 recognizes that it took years to create the crisis that erupted in 2008 and peaked in january of 2009 , " @entity52 said			2
" and it 's going to take some time to work through it			2
" @entity63 senior adviser @entity62 had a similar answer on @entity65 , saying , " i think everyone understands we were this close to a @entity69			2
because of the leadership of this president , we staved that off			0
we 're beginning to recover			0
" @entity6 was riding toward the convention in @entity74 , @entity75 , on a speaking tour of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity80 college campuses hoping to energize young voters , a segment of the electorate critical to his hopes			1
younger voters went overwhelmingly for @entity6 in 2008 and he still holds a lead in the age group in polls , but less decisively than four years ago			1
even if they do n't vote @entity10 , the @entity6 campaign 's concern is that that segment and the others that helped elect him do n't turn out at the rates they did four years ago			1
senior campaign adviser @entity96 told @entity0 's @entity97 on " @entity98 " that no one in @entity6 's campaign " is sitting up here saying this is 2008			1
" but @entity96 did n't think there was a case of buyer 's remorse going into @entity106			1
" i do n't think that there is voter disappointment , " @entity96 said			0
" the voters understand that we have been through a traumatic economic experience in the country , unlike anything that we have ever seen			0
" and @entity96 said the @entity11 was n't offering an alternative , only rehashed ideas			0
" in @entity16 , we saw nothing but insults and old slogans and tired old ideas , " @entity96 said			0
" in @entity74 , the president is going to focus on a plan to provide the middle class in this country necessary and needed security by investing in research and innovation			0
" @entity6 's campaign has used that theme consistently since @entity11 wrapped up their convention last week			1
the president told an audience in @entity78 on saturday that the @entity11 message was something that might as well have been viewed on a black and white television			0
" it was a rerun			0
we 'd seen it before , " @entity6 said			2
@entity6 also challenged @entity10 over his qualifications to be the country 's commander in chief , pointing out at that same rally in @entity78 that @entity10 had failed to mention @entity142 in his acceptance speech			1
" gov. @entity10 had nothing to say about @entity142 last week , " @entity6 said at a campaign rally in @entity78 on saturday			1
" did n't mention it			0
did n't offer a plan in terms of how he might end the war or , if he 's not going to end it , he 's got to let people know			2
" @entity10 campaign senior adviser @entity153 said his candidate had addressed the war in an address to the @entity157 the day before his acceptance speech			0
" president @entity6 has allowed our leadership to diminish , " @entity10 said in that speech			2
" in dealings with other nations , he has given trust where it is not earned , insult where it is not deserved , and apology where it is not due			0
" the acceptance speech had a different purpose , @entity153 said , to " introduce himself to millions of voters who were seeing him for the first time			0
" " we thought that speech was a home run , " he added .			0

@entity6 advisers wo n't answer yes or no on whether voters are better off than in 2008
