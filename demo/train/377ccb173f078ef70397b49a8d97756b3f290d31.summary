-- at long last , @entity1 can indulge her life 's greatest love without fear of persecution			1
hounded out of the notoriously dangerous tribal region that borders @entity7 and @entity8 -- once referred to as " @entity10 's door knocker " -- salvation has been found thousands of miles away on a different continent			1
she survived death threats , spent countless hours alone in her room and masqueraded as a boy for years			1
and all for her love of squash			1
now @entity7 's number one female player , who is ranked 53rd in the world , is homing in on her quest to become the best female player in the world , under the tutelage of @entity26 , the @entity27 star whose name was inscribed on the first racket she ever owned			1
it is a fairytale story that has taken the 22 - year - old a world away from a treacherous existence in the mountains of @entity7 , to @entity26 's academy in @entity37 , and morphed her into an agent for social change in her native country			1
" i think positive and i do positive so i think people in @entity7 need to be educated , need to take part in sports and skills so they have high integrity , high self - esteem and so they use energy in a positive way , " she told @entity0 's @entity43 series			1
" they will start holding rackets and bats rather than holding guns and grenades			2
i do n't want militancy or @entity58 -- i just want a brighter future for all the kids			2
i do n't want them to end up as suicide bombers			2
" growing up in @entity63 provided @entity64 with a crash course in conservatism , a prevalent theme in a territory with a reputation for fierce tribalism			0
" it was an area in between mountains and mud houses and as it was 100 or 200 years ago , " she explained			0
" the girls are deprived of all those basic rights			0
they stay inside the home and get married off at a young age			0
" my whole family was different to the rest of the people in the area -- you could see the progress , the different mindset -- but they were still living in the @entity87			0
" they had no awareness about education or any health or exercise , or women 's rights or child 's rights			0
they did n't know how any education can be important for one person as a human			0
" exasperated at the barriers placed in front of her , @entity64 took drastic action aged just four , burning all her dresses , putting on her brother 's clothes and shearing off her long , dark hair			0
" my dad believes that it is your choice and your right to live the way you want , " she said			0
" he laughed and he gave me a boyish name @entity116 , the greatest warrior in the history of the world			1
he said ' so , we have a fifth son , and his name is @entity116			0
' " however for @entity64 and her family , domestic tolerance came at a price			0
in a society cloaked by repression and inequality , even being seen unaccompanied in public could be perceived as a betrayal of her culture and @entity134 religion			0
and the liberal attitude of her father , @entity64 , who encouraged his wife to continue her education and allowed their daughter to play outside with her brothers , was contradictory to the prevailing attitude of ultra-conservatism			1
so much so that he family decided they 'd had enough after a campaign of intimidation that included the stoning of the family house , attempts on their lives and an imposed spell in an asylum for the father			1
the family moved to the city of @entity158 -- another @entity160 stronghold -- where @entity64 's scrapes intensified , with one scuffle leading to a head injury that required 12 stitches			1
realizing she needed to channel this aggression , her father enrolled her in weightlifting classes at a local sports club , keeping up the pretense she was a boy			1
@entity64 went on to win a junior weightlifting championship , but she also grew fixated on squash , having seen it played on her breaks from training			1
she earned a place at a squash academy run by the @entity178 , though she had to reveal her true identity to the director			1
such was his delight at seeing a girl enraptured by squash he donated a racket to @entity1 bearing the name of @entity26 -- who won 36 top level events during his 15 - year career at the top of the sport			1
but as word spread of her emerging talent , the anonymity @entity64 had reveled in for so long evaporated			0
" attitudes changed , they started bullying but i used to find a way , " she explained			0
" i used to go early in the morning when there was no - one in my way			1
" i used to repair those balls that were bad and torn in the squash court that guys used to throw away with tape and glue			2
" @entity160 's unwanted attention a steady improvement in her game led to appearances in high profile tournaments and prominence in the @entity7 media			1
awards from then president @entity209 and prime minister @entity210 were a mark of her pioneering spirit , but they also attracted the @entity160 's unwanted attention			1
" it was exhausting at every step , " she said			0
" it was hard to let people know all i want is to play squash			2
that 's how i can live happy but i had to change my life with time			0
" for the last eight years i 've been trying hard to come through to the common people and today i 'm getting threats from @entity160			1
i did n't know what to do			0
" i stopped going to the academy because it 's the biggest dishonor if a daughter is kidnapped			2
that 's ( why ) i locked myself in my room and started hitting from evening to morning			0
" her absence was noted and when she relayed the threats she 'd received the issue was debated in parliament , who reacted by beefing up security around her			2
" they put so many attack posts on the way to the squash court and around the squash court too , " she said			2
" above the squash court they put snipers			2
" i was going once a week or twice a month but at that time i completely stopped because if a bomb happened -- there is so much glass in the squash court itself -- it would kill the innocent kids			2
" i did n't want it to be the reason so i stopped going and started playing in my room for three - and - a - half years			1
" it was during this time @entity64 says she knew she had to leave @entity7 to follow her dream			1
" my dad said ' if a baby bird wants to learn flying , he has to leave the nest ' and at that time i realized i can not learn flying while am here			0
" for three - and - a - half years i did n't get any email from anyone and one day i got an email back from @entity263 saying that he 's going to help me , support me , teach me how to play squash so i can play at tournaments and become a world champion for @entity7			1
" @entity26 himself was sent to @entity268 as a 12 - year - old to train with former @entity7 world champion and all - time squash great @entity272 , and was immersed in the culture of @entity116 's country , traveling to play there on many occasions during his career			1
@entity64 's plea struck a chord with @entity26 , who flew her to @entity37 and has since been working on building her strength and stamina , and molding the rawness of her technique into a formidable weapon			1
" i recognized right away this girl is special , she 's very courageous girl and i wanted to help , " said @entity26			1
" she 'll run through that wall 10 times until she finally breaks it			0
she thinks working hard just means killing your body and you 'll get better , but sometimes you have to work smart			0
" it 's so rare to find somebody who has so much drive and so much passion , who is just dying to absorb knowledge			0
i think she 's going to make it to number one in the world			1
" she knows it 's going to take a lot and she 's prepared to sacrifice whatever it takes			0
i think she has the skills and the mental ability to make it all the way			0
" building bridges as for @entity64 , her ambition to be the finest player on the world is now allied to a desire to campaign for other young girls in @entity7 to have the freedom to explore sport			1
" i feel the luckiest person and i think whether my hard work turned me into being lucky or if i am the chosen one to bring change to the world , " she said			2
" i learned it 's more about humanity			0
it 's not about religion , it 's not about culture or caste or tribe or where you 're from or the value of the background of the person			0
" it 's all about being a human			0
i learned a lot and squash taught me			2
through squash i made it and learned otherwise i 'd be stuck in those tribal regions			2
" i want to create bridges between east and west , friendship between country and country , family to family and people to people			0
it 's all about brotherhood -- sharing knowledge , skills , helping each other and sharing love and care for each other			2
