@entity0 -- as @entity2 segues seamlessly through feelgood summer heat from @entity5 mania to royal baby euphoria , let us at least spare a thought for the unfortunate newborn caught , through no fault other than his ancestry , in the global spotlight			1
no royal arrival has been so closely scrutinized since 1688 when @entity15 , wife of the widely disliked @entity16 , gave birth watched by dozens of officials amid speculation that her pregnancy was a @entity22 conspiracy intended to fabricate a male heir			1
even their presence was not enough to quash rumors that the child had been smuggled into the birthing chamber in a bedpan , and within months @entity16 had been deposed ; his son was destined to spend his life in bitter exile in @entity33 and @entity34			0
at least the newborn prince and his parents are unlikely to be run out of the country , even if the flag - waving royalists celebrating the birth are hardly representative of a silent majority largely apathetic about the monarchy and more inclined to treat its modern incarnation as a publicly - subsidized soap opera largely staged for the amusement of @entity48 tourists			0
' wicked ' author : royal baby stands for hope nor did his mother suffer the indignity of having the home secretary in the vicinity of the delivery room , a custom for royal births only formally ended in 1948			2
and there have undoubtedly been worse times in history to be born into one of @entity64 's great royal dynasties			2
@entity65 in 1789 springs to mind , or @entity67 in 1917			0
yet the life prospects of a boy now third in line to the @entity2 crown who , if as lucky in longevity as his paternal great - grandparents , might reasonably expect to see in the 22nd century on the throne , are hardly something to be envied			2
the @entity77 may have recovered some of their respectability after the nadir in their fortunes in the 1990s that culminated in the 1997 death of princess @entity84 , thanks in no small part to the fairy - tale mega-wedding of @entity88 in 2011 and @entity90 - winning propaganda such as " @entity91 " and " @entity92			0
" to question the role of the monarchy and @entity2 ' attachment to it is still to risk a public flogging from more reactionary sections of the @entity2 media , as author @entity100 discovered when she found herself pilloried earlier this year for describing the @entity101 as a " plastic princess designed to breed			1
" the resulting furore missed the point that @entity100 was trying to make , which was that members of the royal family , however privileged and luxurious their lives , are essentially prisoners of their own circumstances , trapped by their supposed obligations to an archaic and largely redundant institution			1
" our current royal family does n't have the difficulties in breeding that pandas do , but pandas and royal persons alike are expensive to conserve and ill - adapted to any modern environment			1
but are n't they interesting ? are n't they nice to look at ? " said @entity100			0
opinion : baby helps make a monarchy better if @entity100 's point was essentially true of @entity101 , who , like a mafia wife , married into the firm of her own volition , how much worse must the situation be for her offspring , who will become public property from the moment he is displayed to the assembled world media on the hospital steps			1
the mainstream media may feign responsibility , keeping a respectful distance as the young family find their feet and honoring royal requests to leave the child alone , but he will still face near constant public intrusion , living a life framed by the ubiquitous lens of the camera phone			1
and in an age obsessed with the oxymoronic phenomena of " reality " and celebrity , the young royal will be forced to perform a gilded simulation of a normality that he will never experience for real , ultimately embracing the stiflingly conservatism of a @entity2 establishment of which the monarchy remains the apex , and allowing their personality to be airbrushed according to public tastes			1
it will be " @entity163 " with footmen			0
royals , for better or worse , once inhabited worlds of intrigue , conspiracy and high drama , their lives , relationships and deaths entwined with the rise and fall of nations and empires			0
the feats and misdeeds of kings , queens and their progeny were fodder for @entity184 epics			0
yet it is centuries since the @entity2 royal family played anything more than a decorative role in the life of the nation -- and this new heir may have to wait the best part of this century before assuming even those diminished duties			1
opinion : how to raise a royal baby @entity198 heirs have traditionally passed the years waiting for their relatives to die by becoming champions of worthy causes			2
prince @entity202 is famed for his woolly opinions on environmentalism and architecture , while prince @entity206 has leant his support to the campaign to tackle homelessness			0
perhaps , out of enlightened self - interest alone and with time on his side , the prince could one day become the first royal to embrace the cause of republicanism			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			0

all eyes have been on @entity101 ahead of the birth of her first baby
@entity2 's royal family is closely watched by the media and the public
@entity218 : new royal should be " first to embrace the cause of republicanism "
