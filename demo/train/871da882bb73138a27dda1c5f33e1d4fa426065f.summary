-- when president @entity1 proclaimed the fight against income inequality is " the defining challenge of our time , " you might have dismissed his words as the effort of a struggling president to revive his political fortunes			1
but anyone looking at the relentlessly expanding income gap can see that the problem is real -- and it is serious			1
the economy is gradually recovering from the @entity17 , but inequality continues to grow			1
in the first two years of recovery , the net worth of the bottom 93 % continued to shrink , while the top 7 % grew wealthier			2
the richest @entity21 are taking the biggest share of national income of any time since 1928			1
rather than dismissing @entity1 's call as a political ploy , @entity27 in the @entity21 and other conservatives across the developed world , should take up the cause and make it their own			1
rising inequality is the proven enemy of stability			1
and nobody benefits more from stability than the wealthy			2
this is their fight , too			2
if trends continue , the well - tended sources of wealth of the rich could get trampled by the march of popular frustration			2
the signs are already here , in the @entity21 and @entity47			2
a sense that unfairness permeates the system is what fosters extreme views , erodes the middle ground , and makes it increasingly difficult for government to function			2
from @entity56 to the @entity57 , populist politics is creating gridlock and producing a government that can not address the country 's problems			1
in @entity47 , the perception of unfairness has fostered extremist parties , such as the neo-fascist @entity65 in @entity67 , with alarming echoes of the 1930s			2
traditionally , inequality is the kind of issue that receives attention from leftist politicians and is shoved aside by those on the right , who expect free markets to work their magic , improving the lives of those who work hard and , by the judgment of some moral gauge , deserve to be rewarded			1
but it turns out that the invisible hand of the market , as economist @entity85 famously described it , may have developed arthritis in recent years			0
@entity1 is right when he says this is undermining the very definition of what @entity21 means			1
the @entity21 was the land of opportunity ; the place where you could succeed regardless of where you were born			0
in the old days , @entity21 was the place where you could be born poor and rise on your own merits			0
today , incredibly , researchers say upward economic mobility is easier in @entity101 and @entity47 than in the @entity21			0
this contract , the " @entity103 , " has meant that the @entity21 was not , and still is n't , a land that is fertile for those seeking to sow class warfare			1
@entity21 was never a place where people hated the rich as much as they wanted -- and often succeeded -- in becoming the rich			0
but the stratospheric rise of incomes at the top is not just an @entity21 problem			0
and the search for solutions is a global pursuit			0
this is a time to debate and innovate ; a time to find the causes of this stagnation of the majority and look for solutions			1
unexpectedly , sedate @entity123 has started experimenting with some startling ideas			0
when @entity123 voters heard that the chairman of @entity128 , a large pharmaceutical corporation , was going to receive some $ 78 million in severance , they mounted a campaign to ban " golden handshakes			0
" they resoundingly approved strict limits on compensation in a referendum last march			0
it 's worth noting that ceos in @entity123 make an average of 148 times what the average workers make			1
in the @entity21 , they make 354 times more , according to the @entity143			1
the most intriguing of all the ideas will come to the voters next year			0
under a proposal spelled out in a referendum , every @entity123 citizen regardless of income would receive a monthly check of $ 2,800 from the government			1
the notion of a guaranteed income is receiving enormous attention around the world			1
the idea defies traditional notions of government assistance and means - testing			0
instead of a giant bureaucracy and complex programs breaking down assistance for food or housing , the government would make sure nobody lives in poverty , and presumably dismantle a host of welfare structures			1
in theory , minimum - income programs would reduce the incentive to work			1
but when a small town in @entity101 conducted a four - year experiment in minimum income , researchers say poverty disappeared , graduation rates went up , and hospitalization rates went down			1
this is just one proposal , and one that focuses more on poverty alleviation than on inequality			2
and inequality itself , not just poverty , is a key issue			2
an unequal society distorts democratic principles			1
financial muscle amounts to political muscle			0
we have seen it in the @entity21 , where campaign donations are reshaping the political landscape			0
you might think this is a great argument for the rich to keep the system exactly the way it is			0
ironically , however , wealthy businesses use their money for political power , but populist politicians are able to tap into discontent and gum up the works			0
the business community hated the government shutdown , but the angry base , particularly on the @entity27 side , supported politicians who kept the government closed			0
the wealthy are more powerful than ever , but they risk losing control of the system if they allow it to continue along its present path			0
self - interest may not be the most admirable reason to fight for justice and a better life for all , but it may just prove persuasive , even if it means heading the call of an embattled president			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			0

@entity231 do n't dismiss @entity1 's speech on inequality as a ploy ; it 's serious
@entity231 : the richest have the biggest share of national income of any time since 1928
conservatives should make ending inequality their cause , she says
@entity231 : an unequal society distorts democracy , causes instability , *promotes* extremism
