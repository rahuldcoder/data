@entity0 -- the latest @entity3 advance in @entity4 has brought a swath of the country 's north - central @entity7 region under siege , with @entity7 leaders warning of another humanitarian crisis without international intervention			1
the @entity4 @entity7 town of @entity14 ( @entity15 in @entity16 ) is an island , surrounded by @entity3 on three fronts and the @entity20 border to the north			1
the town was already mostly blockaded by @entity3 , but in the past three days some 60 nearby villages fell under @entity3 control , according to the @entity26 - based @entity25			1
the @entity27 in @entity28 and @entity4 , or " @entity27 , " as the group calls itself , took 39 villages on friday alone as @entity7 forces withdrew from their positions , the @entity25 said			1
clashes are constant around @entity14 as @entity7 fighters attempt to hold off @entity3 , which is armed with heavy artillery and tanks , @entity7 activist @entity33 told @entity1			2
" mobilization of people in @entity14 is not enough , " said @entity38 , a spokesman for the @entity7 fighters			2
" the international community has to take action			0
if not , there will be a new ( @entity45 ) genocide , but this time in @entity14			0
" @entity45 is the @entity28 city that came under @entity3 attack last month , causing thousands to flee onto adjacent @entity48 , where refugees became stranded and were starving before @entity51 airstrikes helped pave a way for them to flee			1
the fighting around @entity14 has been intense for four days , @entity38 told @entity1			0
@entity54 , the president of the @entity7 in @entity28 , called the @entity3 attacks in northern @entity4 " barbaric " and described them as ethnic cleansing			1
" i ask the international community to take every measure as soon as possible to save @entity14 and the people of @entity4 @entity7 from the terrorists , " he said in a statement			1
" the @entity3 terrorists perpetrate crimes and atrocities wherever they are , therefore they have to be hit and defeated wherever they are			0
" as @entity3 encroached on the nearby villages , residents fled toward @entity14 , said @entity33 , the @entity7 activist			1
there were reports that @entity3 kidnapped some of those fleeing to @entity14 , including women , children and the elderly , @entity33 said			0
at least three rockets landed in @entity14 , causing much panic , he said			0
" there is a great deal of fear , but people are insisting on standing up to @entity3 and remaining steadfast in the face of their attack , " he said			0
@entity20 opens border the fear of a humanitarian crisis in @entity14 rose as displaced people sought refuge there but became trapped between the fighting and the @entity20 border			1
an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 @entity91 fleeing the violence walked right up to the wire border fence with @entity20 , where they initially were not allowed in			2
they just sat at the border as @entity91 on the other side of the fence tried to persuade the @entity20 guards to let them in			2
the situation on the border could be observed on a live feed from the border and from video footage aired on @entity20 news outlets			2
the refugees also tried to force their way into @entity20 , creating chaos as one woman stepped on a landmine			2
@entity20 finally opened the border , relieving some of the mounting pressure in @entity14 and allowing refugees to enter @entity114 province			2
" four thousand of our siblings will be hosted in our country , " @entity20 prime minister @entity115 told state media			0
" opening our arms to our @entity4 brothers is our historic humanitarian responsibility			2
" hosting @entity4 refugees is nothing new for @entity20 and other neighboring nations			1
about 815,000 registered @entity4 refugees were in @entity20 as of last month , part of the 3 million total registered @entity4 refugees that the @entity129 has counted amid @entity4 's three - year civil war			1
a further 6.5 million people were believed to be displaced within @entity4 as of last month , according to the @entity129 @entity51 military on deck the @entity134 on thursday voted overwhelmingly to approve the arming of @entity4 rebels as top @entity51 military leadership approved a plan to strike @entity3 in @entity4			1
the @entity139 approved @entity141 's request wednesday			0
the approval allows president @entity141 to carry out part of his stated strategy to combat @entity3 , though some political leaders remain divided on the way forward			2
with approval in hand to arm and train @entity4 rebels to fight @entity3 , @entity141 said thursday the plan keeps with " the key principle " of @entity51 strategy : no @entity51 combat troops on the ground			1
" the @entity51 troops deployed to @entity28 do not and will not have a combat mission , " he said in televised remarks from the @entity139			0
" their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground			0
... we can destroy @entity3 without having our troops fight another ground war in the @entity164			0
" @entity141 said more than 40 countries , including @entity15 nations , have offered assistance in the battle against @entity3			0
long vetting and training process national security adviser @entity172 , speaking to reporters friday , said that now that approval to arm moderate @entity4 rebels has been given , a long process will start to vet and train those who will be benefit from the measure			1
@entity51 military personnel will train the @entity4 fighters outside of @entity4 , and the process of planning the training and vetting the participants will take months , she said			1
" this is a serious training program , and we are serious about vetting those we are training and equipping , " she said			0
@entity187 stepped around questions about whether airstrikes against @entity3 in @entity4 will require an additional thumbs - up from president @entity141 , repeating the president 's own announcement that the @entity51 is " prepared " to broaden its actions in the region into @entity4			1
@entity3 videos the advance by @entity3 in northern @entity4 comes as the @entity199 group released a 55 - minute english - language video warning @entity51 against " direct confrontation			1
" the video describes the conflict as a fight between believers and nonbelievers , and praises its successes on the battlefield			0
earlier this week , @entity3 released another video showing a captive @entity211 journalist criticizing the @entity51 and @entity211 governments			2
citing the @entity215 terror group 's brutality , from beheading civilians -- including @entity51 journalists @entity217 and @entity219 -- to the mass execution of its opponents , @entity141 said the @entity51 will not back down			2
" with their barbaric murder of two @entity51 , these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world , " @entity141 said			0
" but today , they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before : as @entity51 , we do not give in to fear			0
when you harm our citizens , when you threaten the @entity51 , when you threaten our allies , it does n't frighten us			0
" the question now appears to be not if , but when , the @entity51 will strike @entity3 in its stronghold in northern @entity4			1
the @entity51 military has everything it needs to strike @entity3 targets in @entity4 , a plan that officials told @entity1 is still waiting on @entity141 's signoff			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , is modifying its behavior , from the way it communicates to the way it conceals itself , in response to potential @entity51 airstrikes in @entity4 , @entity51 military officials told @entity1			1
the officials expressed confidence the airstrikes would be effective			0
@entity256 reported from @entity0 , and @entity257 wrote and reported from @entity258			0
