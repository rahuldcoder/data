-- it needed permission from the @entity4 monarch and has the potential to enrage traditionalists , but one of horse racing 's most regal occasions has crossed the rubicon and will allow sponsorship branding for the first time in its 300 - year history			1
like @entity14 for golf 's @entity16 and @entity17 in tennis , @entity15 has thrived with barely a nod in the direction of the commercial world -- until now			2
the most quintessentially @entity23 of all sporting events has signed a five - year partnership deal with a company controlled by the @entity28 royal family			1
do not expect to see massive advertising hoardings bearing the name of @entity31 , shorthand for @entity33			0
but on the first day of the event , which takes place in june , the name will appear in places such as the top of stalls and at the back of the parade ring			0
" it will be limited branding in @entity15 colors , " @entity42 , chief executive of the race course , told @entity0			1
@entity42 said @entity47 was actively seeking " appropriate partners " for the other four days of the meeting but was quick to stress there were some traditions that were not for sale			0
" this most certainly does not extend to the names of races or the name of the event , which will be forever @entity15 , " he said			2
as part of the deal , @entity31 has also agreed to sponsor the @entity60 , a race for leading middle - distance specialists , usually classic winners , held at @entity15 in late july			1
" the time is right for us to maximize the commercial value of our properties , " @entity15 head of communications @entity65 told @entity0			2
competitive era @entity65 also revealed that a major driving factor was the need to attract the best thoroughbreds to @entity15 and its other premier meetings			2
" it 's a competitive market and we want to make sure our prize money is competitive , " he added			1
but while there are clearly sound commercial reasons for the branding deal with @entity31 , would not such a major development need the permission of @entity84 , an avid racing enthusiast ? " anything as important as this we would discuss with @entity88 , " said @entity42			1
" @entity15 was set up by an act of parliament ( @entity89 of 1813 ) and we will be reinvesting everything we can into the business in the form of better facilities as well as better prize money			1
" @entity31 and @entity28 's involvement in elite flat racing in @entity4 and @entity97 is a relatively new development , dating back to 2011			1
their sponsorship of the @entity100 , culminating in @entity101 at @entity15 in october , broke new ground , with both the @entity103 and @entity104 now carrying seven - figure prize money			1
@entity106 , spokesman for @entity107 which runs the series , welcomed the latest investments at @entity15			2
" it 's a real signal to the sport globally that they are here to stay , " he told @entity0			0
previous @entity114 involvement in the flat racing scene was centered around the @entity117 operation of the ruler of @entity119 , sheikh @entity118			0
now the @entity120 are certainly making an impression , additionally sponsoring @entity23 classic races , the 1,000 and 2,000 guineas at @entity124			0
@entity126 connection @entity31 also lent its name to the @entity129 at @entity130 , famously won twice by the unbeaten super horse @entity126			0
at @entity97 's most prestigious race , the @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity28 branding is emblazoned over the race course at @entity137 and last year 's winner @entity138 is @entity28 - owned			1
@entity28 is also flexing its financial muscle in other sports , notably football , which will see the @entity142 staged in the small @entity144 state of just over two million people			2
@entity28 investors also own @entity148 champions @entity147			2
but aside from the controversy about playing conditions in the heat of the @entity153 summer , there has also been criticism of its treatment of migrant workers employed to build the stadia and infrastructure for the competition			0
@entity162 president @entity161 said the situation was " unacceptable " and has met the emir of @entity28 to seek changes			0
@entity15 chief @entity42 would not comment on these specific issues , but added : " we are dealing with an individual investment company -- a private company -- not the @entity28 government			1
" @entity106 added : " there are no labor issues in horse racing			1
" unique event the queen 's views on these matters , as ever , will remain a closely guarded secret , but it is her patronage of @entity15 which ensures it remains a unique event in the sporting calendar			0
last year , her filly estimate won the @entity184 , the first victory for a reigning monarch since the famous race began over 200 years ago			0
she was presented with the trophy by her son @entity189 in front of a hoarding on which there was a sign advertising the @entity194 -- of which the @entity184 was one of the key races			0
a sign , then , of the times to come , and this year the reminders of a more commercial age will be a little more obvious in the most traditional of settings .			0

historic deal will see limited branding at famous royal meeting
