-- the recent hacking of a @entity4 employee 's personal e-mail account is raising questions about the security of storing personal information and business data on the @entity9			1
a @entity4 co-founder says password toughness is important to online security			2
the @entity13 has been buzzing since a hacker allegedly broke into a @entity4 administrator 's personal e-mail account about a month ago and used that information to access the employee 's @entity19 account			1
that account housed some of @entity4 's private financial documents and notes , according to @entity4 's official blog			1
some of those documents circulated the blogosphere on wednesday , and @entity28 , a technology blog , published a @entity4 financial forecast			1
the hacker sent 310 documents to the tech site , according to a post by @entity35 , @entity28 's founder and co-editor			1
in what appears to be a separate incident , a hacker broke into @entity4 chief executive @entity42 ' wife 's e-mail account and then accessed @entity42 ' @entity44 and @entity45 accounts , @entity4 says			1
it 's unclear what if any impact the incidents will have on the future of cloud computing , the idea that documents and computing power can be stored " in the cloud " of the internet rather than on desktops or laptops			1
many tech blogs are weighing in on the hacking 's impact			1
some see the incident as an indication of serious security flaws at @entity4			2
others say it 's a sign @entity4 has gotten big , and any rising company makes a good target for a cyberattack			2
people outside the @entity73 micro-blogging company , such as @entity4 account holders , reportedly were not affected in the incident			2
" this was not a hack on the @entity4 service , it was a personal attack followed by the theft of private company documents , " @entity4 co-founder @entity75 writes on the company 's official blog			1
@entity19 's suite of online applications , which allows users to share and store calendars , spreadsheets and text documents , is not to blame for the hacking , @entity75 said in the post , adding that @entity4 continues to use @entity19			1
" this is n't about any flaw in web apps , " @entity75 writes			0
" it speaks to the importance of following good personal security guidelines such as choosing strong passwords			0
" security experts say it 's best for users to create new passwords for each of their online accounts			0
the passwords generally should be complicated , combining letters , numbers and symbols			0
and they should be changed often			0
@entity108 , a tech site that partners with @entity0 , says the hack highlights how interconnected information is online -- and how vulnerable that setup is to attack			0
" although it seems that @entity4 has been thrust into this situation a bit unfairly , a hack along these lines could have happened to the executives of more web companies than anybody would like to admit , " @entity114 and @entity115 write on the news site			2
" what it really highlights is the extreme interconnectedness of the social web : with the likes of e-mail contact importing and data - portability services like @entity132 now commonplace , a savvy hacker can have access to multiple accounts simply by accessing one			2
" @entity136 , a computer security expert , recently told @entity0 / live that @entity138 are " as secure as anything you 're going to do on the @entity9			0
it 's not any more or less secure than @entity142			0
" writing for @entity144 , a blog that covers online social media , @entity143 says the latest @entity4 breach proves the micro-blogging site needs to address nagging security flaws			0
" there have been so many problems [ at @entity4 ] over the past couple of months that it 's getting hard to keep track of them , " he writes			2
" it 's time to fix it once and for all , because these security issues are a dark shadow looming over the otherwise bright future of this company			0
" @entity161 , editor - in - chief at @entity144 , says the hacking is " another embarrassing moment in @entity4 's torrid growth , but nothing that 's likely to bring the house down			1
" @entity167 , senior editor at @entity168 , offers another analogy			0
" this looks roughly akin to having your underwear drawer rifled : embarrassing , but no one 's really going to be surprised about what 's in there , " he writes			0
another debate happening online concerns @entity28 's decision to publish some of the information stolen from @entity4			2
@entity35 , of @entity28 , writes that " a few of the documents have so much news value that we think it 's appropriate to publish them			0
" still , " there is clearly an ethical line here that we do n't want to cross , and the vast majority of these documents are n't going to be published , at least by us , " he writes			0
some , including @entity28 readers , have criticized the blog 's decision to publish any of the information			0
@entity4 has said it is seeking legal counsel on the matter			1
" we are in touch with our legal counsel about what this theft means for @entity4 , the hacker , and anyone who accepts and subsequently shares or publishes these stolen documents , " @entity75 writes on the site 's blog			1
@entity161 , of @entity144 , writes that there 's nothing " really juicy " in the @entity4 documents			1
" the bottom line seems to be this : your @entity4 accounts are safe , but there are a number of documents that @entity4 would rather not have published publicly in other people 's hands , " he says			1
" but if you 're expecting something really juicy ( like , how @entity4 plans to make money ) , you should probably prepare to be disappointed			0
" what do you think of the news ? are you worried about security and cloud computing ? do you use @entity138 and will you continue to ? what about @entity28 's decision to publish the info stolen from @entity4 ? feel free to chime in with comments below .			1
