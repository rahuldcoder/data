-- it was 2:30 a.m. on the morning of june 4 , 1989			2
from a balcony of the @entity4 , i looked down @entity5 towards @entity6 a few hundred meters away			1
red tracer bullets whizzed through the air			2
the crackle of gunfire echoed through the humid @entity4 night			2
i could see armored vehicles of the @entity12 moving just in front of the famous portrait of chairman @entity15 hanging above the vast square			2
below me crowds gathered , surged forward , and then broke and dispersed as soldiers opened fire at them			0
i watched as others loaded the dead and wounded onto flatbed bicycle carts			0
watch : " @entity24 " as the drama unfolded , my colleagues and i reported it live on @entity0 over a scratchy phone line to transfixed tv audiences around the world			1
the events that night were a turning point for @entity24 , as well as a watershed moment in the history of the media			1
weeks of student - led protests had become the largest movement for political reform in the history of the @entity40			1
the military crackdown i covered had far - reaching consequences , not only for @entity24 's development but also for its relations with the rest of the world			1
global coverage the protests generated unparalleled international coverage , and became a defining moment in the @entity51			1
it was the first time a popular uprising in an authoritarian state was broadcast live across the globe			0
according to @entity56 , who anchored @entity0 's live round - the - clock coverage from @entity4 for much of the crisis : " you could say that that was the beginning of the ' @entity0 effect ' " -- the idea , which became widespread after @entity6 , that the immediacy of live tv news available 24 hours a day played a crucial role in influencing the behavior of key players during major crises			1
the images from that time -- the @entity71 , the man in front of the tank -- became enduring symbols of popular resistance to injustice			1
in the @entity81 , the coverage of @entity6 redefined the relationship between the press , public opinion , and foreign policy - making , and brought an end to the romance in @entity87 - @entity81 relations that had begun with @entity89 's trip in 1972			1
to this day , the event and the images continue to shape international perceptions of the country			1
it was no accident that at a @entity81 congressional hearing on @entity6 in late may , lawmakers from both parties emphasized how the television coverage from 25 years ago had influenced popular views of @entity24			1
@entity6 legacy inside @entity24 , @entity100 also continues to exert a profound influence			1
the crisis in 1989 led paramount leader @entity103 to purge liberal officials who had sympathized with the students , and replace them with more conservative figures			0
yet for @entity103 , a central lesson of @entity6 was that public confidence in the @entity109 could only be maintained by continuing the market - oriented economic reforms begun in the 1980s			1
in the wake of @entity6 , @entity103 pushed to revive and accelerate the reform process , triggering a bitter fight with the very conservatives he had relied on to back his decision to crack down in 1989			1
in what was his last great political battle , @entity103 triumphed , and his efforts paved the way for @entity24 's emergence as an economic powerhouse			0
yet for the same reason -- ensuring the party 's survival -- @entity103 also stifled any new moves towards political reform , as did those who followed him			0
in particular , fearing that the events of that june could undermine the party 's legitimacy , @entity4 has relentlessly sought to erase june 4 from public memory			0
all public discussion of the crisis is banned			0
every @entity135 , the authorities move against anyone seeking to raise the issue , whether dissidents , lawyers , or relatives of those who died			0
the @entity109 in effect offered the @entity87 people a bargain : greater economic opportunity and more personal -- as opposed to political -- freedom in return for not challenging the party 's monopoly on power			2
' suffocating control ' despite pervasive political repression , it is a bargain many @entity87 have accepted			0
and with the passage of time , the suffocating control of any public discussion , along with stunning economic growth , has meant that for the vast majority of @entity87 , the events of 1989 have faded from memory			0
an entire generation knows little but the official government version of what occurred			0
yet memories of 1989 still haunt the @entity109			0
ensuring that nothing like it occurs again remains a central feature of @entity4 's policies on a host of issues			0
this can be seen in the exceptionally nervous reactions to the @entity173 spring and so - called " color revolutions " in parts of the @entity180 , the growth of the internal security services , the intense repression in @entity184 and @entity185 , the harsh actions against dissidents like the imprisoned @entity189 winner @entity188 , and the government 's management of the thousands of protests over local issues that occur in @entity24 every year			2
so far , @entity4 's approach has generally worked and the @entity87 leadership has proved itself to be more skillful and resilient than many in 1989 would have predicted			0
however , with the country 's economy slowing , social and economic tensions rising , and the @entity196 and other new forms of communication giving citizens new tools to voice their opinions and generate political pressure , the @entity109 is facing new challenges -- which could give new resonance to the legacy of @entity6			1
@entity4 's approach to june 4 therefore remains a paradox			0
a quarter of a century later , the @entity109 still feels compelled to use all the powers of the state to convince people inside @entity24 that nothing worth remembering happened on a date that , outside the country , will be an occasion for reflection and analysis of what remains the gravest crisis @entity219 has faced since the revolution of 1949 .			2
