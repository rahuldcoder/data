@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are " compelling reasons " to believe the @entity8 government was responsible for forging @entity4 passports used in a plot to kill a @entity12 leader in the @entity13 earlier this year , @entity4 foreign secretary @entity3 said tuesday			1
" such misuse of @entity4 passports is intolerable , " @entity3 said , adding that the fact that @entity8 was an ally of the @entity4 " only adds insult to injury			1
" the passports were " copied from genuine @entity4 passports " in a " highly sophisticated operation , " indicating a government was behind it , @entity3 told the @entity25			1
@entity27 's @entity26 concluded that the 12 @entity4 people whose passports were cloned where " wholly innocent victims of identity theft , " the foreign secretary said			1
the @entity4 expelled an @entity8 diplomat and changed the advice it gives its citizens about traveling to @entity8 as a result of the scandal , @entity3 said			1
he did not name the diplomat or say what rank the envoy held			0
" the @entity4 had absolutely no advance knowledge of what happened in @entity44 nor any involvement whatsoever in the killing " of @entity47 , he said			1
@entity8 foreign minister @entity48 complained that the @entity8 " have not been given any evidence pointing to @entity8 's involvement in the affair			1
" " we attribute great importance to our relations with @entity27 , " he said			0
" we maintain several different and sensitive dialogues with the @entity4 , and we regret the @entity4 decision			2
" @entity61 authorities also have opened an investigation into the alleged use of forged documents , the @entity59 prosecutor 's office said tuesday			0
suspects in the killing allegedly used four doctored @entity61 passports , the prosecutor said in a written statement			0
" further investigation has revealed that these four passports were actually false as the photos did not correspond to the names appearing in each document , " the statement said			0
@entity75 , a founding member of @entity12 ' military wing , was found dead january 20 in his @entity44 hotel room			1
police believe he was killed the night before , allegedly by the secretive @entity8 foreign intelligence unit @entity79			1
two sources told @entity2 earlier this month that the number of identified suspects in @entity47 's death was up to 27			2
of them , 26 were carrying @entity86 or @entity87 passports , authorities have said			0
the sources -- an official familiar with the investigation and a police source -- did not say which nation issued the passport used by the 27th suspect			1
the 27 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to @entity44 for the killing , then scattered to several far - flung locations afterward			1
but lt. gen. @entity99 , @entity44 police chief , has said not all the suspects had fraudulent passports -- " we know some of the names are real			1
" @entity103 , the international police agency , has issued " red notices " to help search for the suspects			0
the notices are not international arrest warrants , but are a way of alerting police forces around the world that the suspects are wanted by @entity13 authorities			0
@entity103 expands search for suspects @entity103 secretary - general @entity115 said investigators have established " clear " links through passport records , video surveillance , dna analysis , witness interviews and hotel , credit card , phone and transport records , according to a statement			0
police have said toxicology results show @entity47 was injected with succinylcholine , a drug used to relax muscles during surgery or as an anesthetic , before he was suffocated			1
signs indicated that @entity135 resisted as he was being suffocated , police said			0
@entity75 's family members were told earlier that police had found blood on a pillow			2
authorities have also said the killers left some of @entity135 's medication next to him in an apparent effort to make the death appear natural			0
but " the medication left next to him in the room has nothing to do with the killing , " @entity99 has said			0
@entity99 told @entity2 last month that he is " 100 percent sure " @entity79 was responsible			2
" the @entity79 needs to be ashamed of its actions , " he said			2
" they sent 26 , 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two @entity8 soldiers			2
" @entity44 police : @entity79 should be ' ashamed ' @entity12 has said @entity47 was behind the 1989 deaths of the @entity8 soldiers			1
@entity8 has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement			2
@entity48 , however , told @entity164 earlier this month , " there is certainly no reason to think that the @entity79 and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there			1
" the total of 27 suspects does not include two palestinians arrested in @entity172 and returned to @entity44			0
@entity99 said one is not believed to be directly involved in @entity47 's death , but " he is wanted by one of the @entity178 factions in the @entity178 territories and he is sentenced to death and that 's why we will extradite him			0
" he declined to discuss anything about the other @entity178			0
