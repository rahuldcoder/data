@entity0 , @entity1 -- despite the passage of a law banning @entity7 - era officials from @entity1 's government , armed groups continued their blockade of two ministry buildings in @entity0 on monday , this time demanding the dismissal of prime minister @entity12			1
the adoption of the political isolation law by @entity1 's parliament on sunday had been a main demand of militiamen who surrounded the foreign and justice ministries last week			0
but on monday some of the armed protesters said they want @entity12 out			1
" we came out with two main demands , the political isolation law and the dismissal of @entity12 's government , " said @entity22 , one of the leaders of the armed protest			1
@entity22 said the protesters will not back down from this demand , and ministries will continue to be surrounded until @entity12 steps down			1
according to @entity22 , indirect negotiations with officials close to the prime minister were under way			1
last week two senior government confirmed talks with the leaders of the armed protests to try and resolve the situation			1
on sunday , a member of the @entity41 -- @entity1 's parliament -- told @entity2 that there were discussions among some lawmakers to withdraw confidence from @entity12 's government			2
@entity22 accused @entity12 of being unfit to rule @entity1 , and some of the prime minister 's official appointments were opposed by former revolutionary fighters			1
@entity12 's actions , @entity22 said , disrespected and provoked them			2
he said his group protested peacefully for months , but when their demands were not met , they resorted to armed protests			1
" ( the government ) forced us to do this			0
i hold them responsible ; this is the only language they understand , " he said			0
@entity22 is the deputy head of an umbrella group created at the end of 2011 that includes several former rebel groups			0
many @entity1 expressed concern on sunday that the law 's passage after months of political wrangling would undermine the democratic process and further embolden armed groups			2
so far the @entity1 government has said it will not use force in dealing with the armed protests to avoid bloodshed , according to recent comments from @entity12			1
" the government has so far shown a policy of restraint ; they can actually confront if they chose to , but that would seem like a civil war broke out in @entity1 , " said @entity76 , a contributor to @entity79 's " transitions " blog			0
" i think that is why they 're still showing restraint until now			0
not sure how long for though			0
" according to @entity76 , the government has the support of some regional militias who could mobilize if there any efforts to remove @entity12 by force			2
like some other @entity1 analysts , @entity76 believes the armed protests are fueled by political interests			1
he says leaders of the movement , such as @entity22 , ran in last year 's parliamentary elections but failed to win a seat			0
@entity22 also tried to become prime minister , but he could not secure enough parliamentary votes for a nomination			2
" these guys are n't representatives of anyone but their own interests and agendas ... it is nothing to do with legitimacy , democracy or safeguarding of the revolution			0
... to me , this is pure struggle for power and influence , " @entity76 said			0
@entity12 's government , in power since november , inherited a country awash in weapons and militias and has taken steps to try and rein in these groups as it struggles to build an army and a police force			2
" @entity12 and his government took a tough line on militias in @entity0 and @entity130 , and they are now paying the price for such a line , " @entity76 said .			0
