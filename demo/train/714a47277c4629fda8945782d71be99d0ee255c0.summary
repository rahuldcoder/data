@entity0 , @entity1 -- the main aim of president @entity6 's getting - to - know - you meetings with @entity8 counterpart @entity7 in @entity9 is to build a personal relationship between the men who lead the world 's two most powerful countries			2
but they have a lot of thorny issues to discuss , not least the shared challenge of what to do about @entity19			2
the two sides will probably repeat well - worn mantras on their desires to see the denuclearization of the @entity24 and the need to ensure stability in the region			0
but @entity6 should take a step back from the stalemate high politics and raise the case of @entity31			2
@entity32 is a 15 - year - old @entity19 orphan who was forcibly repatriated from @entity34 , through @entity8 to @entity35 last month , along with eight of her young friends who were all trying to get to @entity1			1
these nine young refugees are unique in that we know their identities and because they got all the way to @entity34 before being caught and sent back			2
forced to return home but there are thousands more @entity19 who have risked their lives to leave their country , only to be caught in @entity8 and forcibly repatriated			1
the @entity19 government makes it illegal to leave the country without state permission , and refugees we have spoken with tell us that a typical minimum punishment for repatriated citizens is a three - month interrogation which involves beatings and torture			1
for those suspected of having associated with @entity1 or other foreigners , involvement in religious activities , or attempts to go to @entity1 , refugees tell us that the punishment is ramped up to months of forced labor or banishment to a political prison camp			0
the @entity19 government denies human rights violations and has said that the country has " one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world			1
" tightening security the problem on the border is getting worse			0
since @entity77 came to power , there have been marked increases in border security on both sides of the @entity83 border			0
people on the ground in the region , as well as refugees that my organization has assisted have reported that over the past 18 months physical border security has been built up on both sides , border guards have been reorganized and incentive structures changed to reduce corruption			0
punishments for those caught at the border or sent back from @entity8 have been become even more severe			2
@entity8 authorities have actively cooperated with the @entity19 government in this effort by implementing security crackdowns on their side of the border that have made it increasingly difficult for activists and defection brokers to assist people fleeing from @entity19			1
the result is that 2012 saw a 44 % drop in the number of @entity19 refugees arriving in @entity1 compared to 2011 ( from 2,700 to 1,500 )			2
the figures so far for this year show a further 20 % drop in arrivals compared to last year , according to data from @entity1 's @entity114			0
@entity8 leaders bristle when foreigners call them out on human rights issues			1
they counter that outsiders should not infringe on their sovereignty or meddle in their " internal affairs			0
" but the @entity8 government 's crackdowns on @entity19 refugees is by nature an international issue involving the violation of human rights of citizens of another country -- a clear abrogation of international refugee law that the @entity8 government has ratified			1
vulnerable people the current heightened crackdown on @entity19 refugees should give president @entity6 the urgency to lead the international community in voicing concern for these vulnerable people , and suggest that the @entity8 government 's actions will affect interpretations of what kind of superpower @entity8 aims to be , in terms of their emphasis on acting according to international law , humanitarian principles and in the interests of global human progress			1
for their part , the @entity8 authorities should also take a longer - term , strategic view in their implementation of policy on this issue			2
@entity156 repatriates @entity19 refugees to serve the dual goals of preserving their political relationship with @entity35 and preserving " stability " on both sides of the border			1
but such clear complicity in the @entity19 government 's repression of their people puts the @entity8 government on the wrong side of not just international opinion and increasingly even the @entity8 people 's attitudes towards @entity19 , but also the wrong side of history			1
grassroots capitalism @entity19 is changing			0
the gradual breakdown of centralized control , an unstoppable grassroots capitalism , new information flows , an explosion of corruption and even demographic shifts and the rise of a " market generation " mean that the current system is unsustainable in the long term			0
@entity19 refugees are playing a quiet but vital role in this bottom - up transformation of the country by acting as a bridge back into their homeland			1
a december 2010 survey of 396 defectors living in @entity1 conducted by the @entity191 for @entity192 showed that 50 % maintain contact with their families in @entity19 through illicit channels , accelerating flows of information and money back into the country			1
i personally know defectors who have sent back thousands of dollars even in their first year of resettlement in @entity1 , and professor @entity202 at @entity203 in @entity0 estimates that a total of $ 10 - 15 million flows back in remittances from resettled @entity19 refugees every year			2
this money fuels the grassroots marketization and has the effect of liberalizing and opening up @entity19 society from the bottom - up , increasing the pressure for change			0
pressure from within the @entity8 government has long wanted @entity19 to mimic its own process of economic liberalization and opening , in order to be a more reliable economic partner and improve stability in the long term			1
this can be seen in the subtle and not - so - subtle hints on the need for reform that are dropped every time a top @entity19 official visits their country			2
but @entity156 has been trying this charm offensive for over a decade , and they surely now realize that @entity19 's leaders listen to no foreign government and are impervious to such external pressure			0
the only pressure point that can really change the regime 's calculus is the bottom - up pressure from their own society that no authoritarian government can ignore			0
if @entity19 refugees are able to quietly pass through @entity8 without being actively hunted down and sent back -- as they were freer to do under a policy of " benign neglect " a few years ago -- then they will be able to play this bridge role and increase the pressure for change from within @entity19 , which is the only kind of pressure that can effectively force the regime to innovate and adapt their governing system in a sustainable way			1
on the other hand , if @entity156 follows @entity35 's will and unstintingly collaborates in the repression of the @entity19 people , they will enable the regime to bunker down , deny change and store up bigger problems for the future			0
meanwhile @entity35 will continue to develop its nuclear weapons and missiles and engage in periodic provocations , unsettling the region and worsening @entity8 's strategic environment , as well as their relationship with the @entity265 , @entity1 and @entity266			0
increasing frustration @entity8 will also continue to hemorrhage soft power on this issue , increasing distrust with people of other countries in the region			0
and if and when @entity19 finally does open up or reunify with the @entity1 , the people of @entity19 will not easily forget the @entity8 government 's brazen complicity during decades of their government 's repressive policies			1
this will create a long - term complication in @entity8 's relationship with either a reformed @entity19 or a reunified @entity24 alike			1
people the world over will watch and hope that the presidents of @entity8 and the @entity265 can develop a productive and healthy relationship in order to more effectively deal with the shared challenges that affect much of humanity			0
but if frank and tough discussions on both countries ' roles in the world can not happen in this setting , then where can they happen ? the @entity8 government is increasingly frustrated with @entity19 but has always fundamentally fallen back on preserving the status quo			1
@entity6 should urge @entity7 and others with the power to change @entity8 's direction to reconsider their active cooperation with @entity35 's repression of their people , particularly on the issue of forced repatriations of refugees , which only prolongs the denial of an opening which will one day become inevitable			0
it is not too late for the @entity8 government to chart a new path on the right side of history , and be remembered as a force for positive change in @entity19 rather than a collaborator in the regime 's repression			1
ultimately , that is not just the right thing to do ; it 's also the smart thing to do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity323 .			0
