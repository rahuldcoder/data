-- @entity1 , a straight - talking @entity2 rancher on the @entity5 - @entity4 border , awoke recently to find 50 cows roaming freely in his front yard			2
undocumented immigrants , he says , left a gate open as they crossed his land , which abuts the @entity11			1
for years , he 's witnessed migrants and drug smugglers touch @entity5 soil for the first time on his property			2
" we deal with this every day , " he said			0
but as a rancher in @entity19 , he also knows firsthand the need for labor to keep producers in the @entity23 operating			0
the traffic through his land frustrates him -- particularly the potentially dangerous drug traffic -- but he acknowledges that most crossers are looking for opportunity			0
it is an open secret that many of these undocumented immigrants will indeed find jobs in the local economy			1
more than 1,700 miles away , @entity5 lawmakers are engaged in their own debate over how to balance security concerns and immigrant labor needs			2
the @entity37 has proposed one solution in the form of a sweeping immigration bill that the chamber passed last month			1
border security figures prominently in that bill , and is also a priority for members of the @entity46 , where the debate has moved			1
five reasons immigration reform is n't close those who live and work on the border say there is a disconnect between the debate in @entity55 and the realities on the ground			1
voices of the border communities @entity60 of border fencing built by the federal government -- actually a levy that was cut in half and reinforced with concrete to form a wall -- run across @entity1 's property near @entity68 , @entity2			1
two 40 - foot gaps exist in the barrier so that workers can access all parts of the ranch , but there are no gates , creating a funnel for migrants and traffickers to cross			0
@entity1 's experiences make him hawkish on beefing up the border , but he does n't just want more border patrol agents			1
he wants to see work permits granted the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the @entity5			1
the agriculture industry in the @entity23 depends on immigrant labor , he said			0
" they ( the government ) just need to face up to the situation and give all these people work permits , " @entity1 said			1
opinion : immigrants are driving the housing recovery migrants will keep coming across the border as long as there is work and a chance to make money , the rancher said			1
" farmers need the help , no doubt about that , because nobody wants to do the work , " said @entity101 , a farmer and agricultural producer , in @entity103 , @entity2			2
how immigration reform would affect 3 families for those whose lands are traversed by migrants , the biggest concern is drug traffickers , more so than economic migrants , he said			2
putting undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship would provide not just more able hands , but the relief of knowing who is crossing the border , he said			1
for others , securing the border is not about how many boots are on the ground			2
border security means that people on both sides of the boundary feel safe , said @entity133 , coordinator of the @entity134			1
that is not the case , he said			0
the @entity134 represents 11 community - based organizations focused on the area 's poorest residents			2
to many of these residents , the border patrol is something threatening , @entity133 said			1
reports of heavy - handedness by border agents -- including use of force -- has bred mistrust among some border residents			2
in one case in @entity153 last year , a border patrol agent shot and killed an adolescent who had been throwing rocks alongside several others at the border			1
the border patrol confirmed that agents were being assaulted with rocks and that after verbal warnings to stop , one agent fired his service weapon			1
many in the community hear the stories of alleged beatings or use of stun guns by border agents and have become wary of their presence			2
" we have a completely different perception " than outsiders , @entity133 said			0
the fears of the community are compounded by the fact that many families live in mixed - status households , where some members are living in the country legally and others are n't , creating fear of separation			2
@entity133 said a further buildup along the border would be bad both for businesses and the welfare of the communities			2
the view from @entity55 the @entity37 immigration overhaul bill passed only after being amended to include tough border security measures : doubling the number of border patrol agents on the southern border to nearly 40,000 , increasing fencing to 700 miles and deploying more technology			1
in the @entity197 - controlled @entity46 , border security is being touted as a prerequisite before any undocumented immigrants are placed on a potential path to citizenship			1
" i understand the issues our borders face and am committed to making sure the first thing that must be addressed with any immigration bill is strengthening and protecting the border , " said rep. @entity202 , @entity203 , a member of the bipartisan @entity46 group working on a bill			1
but some who study the border say the boundary with @entity4 is as safe as it 's ever been , and it does n't make sense to flood the place with border agents			2
" it sounds good and it looks good politically , " to add more agents , said @entity218 , senior associate for @entity4 and @entity220 at the @entity221 , or @entity221			0
" calls for border security do n't always reflect reality			1
" opinion : should @entity5 be more like @entity4 ? currently , the border patrol is already double the size it was in 2005			1
as the agency grew , the number of illegal crossers apprehended decreased			0
in 2005 , each border agent -- on average -- apprehended 118 undocumented immigrants that year , according to data extrapolated by @entity221			1
last year , that number fell to 19 apprehensions per agent			0
if the border patrol is doubled in size again , how much further would that number fall ? would there be a lot of agents standing on the border doing nothing ? not just a border issue about 70 miles north of the @entity23 lies @entity249 , a community that has seen the cost of illegal immigration up close , even though it is not located on the border			1
the county includes the town of @entity256 , the site of the last border patrol checkpoint on @entity258			1
make it past the checkpoint , and a smuggler or migrant could be home free			0
most migrants try to avoid the checkpoint altogether , choosing instead to go around it by hiking deep into the vast tracts of ranch land			0
but too often they become lost , or succumb to the unforgiving heat and die			0
in 2012 , 129 bodies of migrants were found in @entity249			0
at least 42 have been found so far this year -- 11 in the past two weeks			0
it can cost the county nearly $ 2,000 to pick up a body , transport it , and perform an autopsy			0
the county is also burdened with the costs of sending its deputies to these scenes instead of patrolling the community			0
the counties that are right on the border have access to federal funds to offset law enforcement and other costs , but @entity249 does not			0
@entity288 : immigrants survive wild ride in u-haul truck the border " is n't secure , and i do n't think they will ever secure it , " @entity249 judge @entity292 said			2
still , @entity292 says that doubling the border patrol and prioritizing border security before immigration reform is not the answer			1
" i think they do n't get it			0
i do n't think that 's the solution , " he said			0
more agents will not stop determined migrants , but will simply drive up the price that a smuggler charges , he said			0
it also raises the likelihood that smugglers will choose riskier routes , meaning that even more people may die from exposure , he said			0
what @entity292 would like to see is a deployment of current border agents to high - crossing areas , and a focus on catching drug traffickers			0
what do border agents want ? the border patrol would appear to have the most to gain from an immigration bill with a tough security component			1
it would mean more money and more manpower			0
but @entity327 , vice president of the union that represents border agents , the @entity328 , says that is not the case			0
rather than spending millions hiring and training 20,000 new agents , it makes more sense to properly fund the existing force to bring the border patrol up to 100 % staffing for current agents , he said			1
that alone would be the equivalent of 5,000 new agents			0
calls for increased technology , from sensors to unmanned aerial vehicles are nice , but they are just tools , @entity327 said			0
it takes an agent to make an arrest , he said			0
" we appreciate the sentiment , but we think ( the immigration bill ) has to be tweaked a bit , " he said .			1

the @entity37 's immigration bill calls for doubling the size of the border patrol
the @entity46 is debating a strong security component to its bill , too
those who live on the border have a *nuanced* view of security
many want work permits for undocumented immigrants
