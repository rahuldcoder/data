-- @entity1 have sacked coach @entity2 after their disappointing home draw to bottom - club @entity4 on tuesday extended the club 's winless run to seven games			1
despite lying fifth in the @entity9 table , @entity1 were knocked out of the lucrative @entity10 by @entity12 side @entity11 last week			2
@entity2 had also secured a @entity14 final against @entity15 but it was n't enough to save the 46 - year - old 's job			1
the club 's sporting director @entity19 admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had " done what i had to			1
" he told the club 's official web site : " it was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution , and the pain that it brings			1
" tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team			2
without doubt we are grateful to @entity36			0

" fortunately we believe that there is time			0
the growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager			0

" @entity4 's injury - time equaliser on tuesday meant @entity1 's last league success was against @entity52 back in february			1
