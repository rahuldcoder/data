@entity0 , @entity1 -- her family calls her the @entity5			1
@entity6 , who is someone who is known to be able to calm her husband down when needed , is taking center stage in trying to paint a more personal picture of her husband of 43 years			1
" whenever @entity5 might start , you know , winding up and getting really -- highly energetic they 're -- they know that i have , like , a very calming influence on him , " @entity6 told @entity2 chief political analyst @entity11 in a wide - ranging and at times emotional interview at the family 's @entity18 lakeside home			1
when asked her secret , she could n't really explain it			2
the couple met as high schoolers in @entity24			1
they were separated for 2Â½ years when @entity26 went off to @entity27 to serve as a mormon missionary			2
during that period , he was involved in an accident while driving the mission president and his wife ; they were hit by what is believed to have been a drunken driver			2
" he was thrown out of the car			2
and so you realize how close your brush with death was , " she told @entity11			2
initially , the family got dire news			1
" i had word that he was killed ... on his passport it is stamped that he is dead , " she said			2
" and so that was the first word we heard			2
" he would have some serious injuries but would recover and stay in @entity27 , actually taking over the mission			2
when he returned to the @entity55 , he immediately proposed to @entity56 they would start a family in @entity59 and then move to @entity60			1
" we are each other 's best friend in addition to being , you know , our , you know , loving relationship			1
we are each other 's best friends as well , " she said			1
she described their marriage as " a real partnership			1
" asked if she gave him advice , she said " of course " adding " we share everything			2
there 's nothing we do not know about , you know , any struggle that either one of us is going through			1
" of course i give him advice , and of course he gives me advice			2
and i think we listen to each other more than we listen to anyone else			2
" she described a job that her husband also talked about to @entity2 , but it is one the family rarely discusses publicly : he served as head of the @entity93 congregation in @entity94 , @entity60 , because the church does not employ paid clergy			1
so @entity26 not only led services but counseled members of the congregation and helped them in whatever way he could			1
" i look at and see how -- how wonderful that was , " she said			2
" when we 're mothers and responsible for children , there 's something that happens to us -- that service gene that 's naturally there where we 're taking care , we 're watching over			1
" and for men , they often do n't get that experience			0
but when you serve in a way @entity5 was serving at that time , that 's exactly the experience he had : nurturing , caring , looking out for , being concerned			1
" @entity6 has had several health scares over the years and has come back from all of them : early stage breast cancer , a surgery for a growth in her abdomen , several miscarriages -- and a 1998 diagnosis of multiple sclerosis which rocked the family and she said made her " really dig deep			1
" @entity126 share their ms struggles , triumphs " i was for a long time , after the diagnosis , trying to just struggle through on my own , not sharing with how hard of a time i was having			1
and so , you know , you kinda just wan na tough it out and not be a burden to anyone else			0
but then , finally , you just ca n't go on , " she said			0
" i really just was having a very , very hard time , and was very depressed , " she told @entity11 , " and had kind of given up a little bit in thinking that i was -- you know -- it was a little overwhelming			1
" her husband took over the household chores -- cooking , going to the grociery store -- and reassured her " that it was n't fatal , we were gon na be ok , " she said			0
" no matter what i went through , he was gon na be there next to me and he was gon na be helping me			0
" and he was like , ' i do n't care how sick you get , i 'm gon na take care of you			0
and i do n't care if you end up in a wheelchair , we 'll be ok			0
' " at that point , she said , " i was n't able to do anything			0
" " he 's amazing , " she said of @entity26 , " because he is so energetic and so on that , for me even when i was as sick as that he would curl up in the bed with me			1
" it was , like , he was gon na do anything he could to just say , " i 'm here			0
just stay right there and we 'll be ok			0
" she said uncertainty about the disease , which has no cure , was very hard for her to face			0
" you do n't know how much is it gon na chew me up and spit me out ? ... how sick am i gon na get ? is this going to be progressive ? am i going to be in a wheelchair ? am i , you know , gon na lose all function ? " there 's this huge unknown			1
and it 's a very , very frightening place to be			1
" she tried various ways to deal with the symptoms , especially fatigue , including an alternative treatment called reflexology , in which pressure is applied to various parts of the body			0
she also tried horse riding			0
while she had not seen major problems from the disease in recent years , she did have a relapse around the @entity193 primaries in march			0
" i overdid and i knew i was overdoing , " she said			0
most people have " a reserve tank , " she explained , but " with @entity197 you go to empty and you go to empty			1
" " it 's like you ca n't take another step			1
and that 's kinda what happened to me			1
... i knew i was pushing the limit			0
but i also did n't say anything to anyone			0
" her husband did n't notice , she said , and " i do n't blame him for not noticing			0
and i do n't think i was even in the same states			0
i was going to my own states			0
" she said she " just had to get past that mile mark and then i 'd be ok , and i could rest			0
but i did n't quite make it to the mile mark			0
" as she heads into this fall 's campaign and an increasing schedule of rallies and appearances , how does she deal with the sort of stress that can trigger the disease ? the stress " is a great teacher , " she said			1
because ( @entity227 ) ca n't absorb all this that 's going on around me			1
there 's a lot of noise and there 's a lot of really negative noise that 's going on around me , around my husband -- during this campaign			2
and so i have to just learn how to not to let that just get into my psyche			0
" she also described a different side of the @entity26 than the one seen by the public : " fun - loving , warm , spontaneous			0
" " get him out of the public eye ( and ) he is loose and funny and spontaneous as you 'd ever want to be			0
and just so much fun to be with			0

the @entity247 met as high schoolers ; their relationship has withstood the test of time
their shared faith and friendship has helped keep the marriage strong
@entity6 's struggles with @entity197 , family 's *adjustment* to campaigning are *challenging*
