-- the secretive @entity2 artist @entity1 , not content with the immense publicity already generated by his recent decision to create graffiti and other art installations around @entity7 each day for a month , may have finally worn out his welcome			1
in a crude , obscene bid for attention , @entity1 published a rant on sunday against @entity13 , calling it a " shy skyscraper " that " so clearly proclaims the terrorists have won			1
" interactive : explore @entity1 in @entity7 " you currently have under construction a one thousand foot tall sign that reads , ' @entity7 -- we lost our nerve , ' " he wrote			1
" @entity13 declares the glory days of @entity7 are gone			2
" @entity7 , who are still recovering from the billions of dollars and thousands of lives lost at the @entity13 on september 11 , 2001 , reacted with understandable outrage			2
" @entity29 " screamed the front - page headline of the @entity26 , proclaiming that @entity1 " spits on graves of 9/11 victims			2
" @entity7 is a city long accustomed to attention - seeking huckster - artists who push -- and exceed -- the limits of decency and good taste			2
but even in a town that gave the world @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , the @entity1 screed against the @entity13 site was a bit much to bear			1
@entity1 , who perhaps imagines he 's bringing a fresh , avant - garde perspective to the issue , is actually joining the conversation about a decade too late			1
back when the @entity13 was still a smoking , twisted pile of debris , all sorts of @entity7 -- from planners and artists to financiers , politicians and everyday citizens -- had begun a vast , anguished debate over what , if anything , should be built on the 16 acres where so many perished			1
countless planning meetings were held , involving arts groups , real estate professionals , engineers and political leaders			0
a string of group brainstorming sessions ( called charrettes ) was convened , where different ideas were sketched out and turned into models			0
artists and architects were invited to dream up something new , and nine different designs emerged			0
i was one of the planners behind an extraordinary two - day public planning session , called listening to the @entity78 , in which thousands of @entity7 gathered at a convention center and spent hours discussing and electronically voting on the different visions , and talking about the principles that should govern the rebuilding			0
groups of total strangers sat and asked one another key questions			0
how much space should be devoted to commerce ? how large should the memorial be ? should the site be returned to its original use as an office tower , or turned into a @entity94 - type urban meadow ( the use suggested by ex-mayor @entity96 ) ? at the time , there was a serious question about whether any large companies would choose to relocate in a place that had twice been attacked by terrorists			0
and along the way , we tackled the very issue @entity1 is now whining about : what effect will the new building have on the city skyline ? @entity7 also debated whether to create a memorial near , beneath or alongside a new building			1
in the end , we opened the memorial design to the entire world , resulting in more than 5,000 entries , constituting the largest design competition in history			0
one wonders if @entity1 bothered to send in a sketch			0
the matter was largely resolved the way big public questions are supposed to get settled in a democracy : through a chain of public and private conflicts and compromises that generated a final product reflecting many visions			0
like many iconic buildings in @entity7 , @entity13 is a place of commerce , continuing a tradition that created the @entity7 skyline -- from the @entity132 ( the first skyscraper ) to the @entity133 , @entity134 and the original @entity13 itself			1
the men who designed and built these and many other bold cathedrals of capitalism were trying to make money , not art. @entity140 , the developer of the @entity13 , received a multi-billion - dollar insurance payment for the destroyed building , under terms that included a requirement that he rebuild and lease an equivalent amount of commercial space			1
and after the loss of 3,000 people in one of the worst atrocities ever committed on @entity155 soil , the issue of security was seared into the thinking of the public and private authorities involved in rebuilding the site			0
@entity7 fought , fussed and financed for years			0
" 104 floors of compromise ? " asks @entity1			1
the basic proposition of @entity155 -- the @entity164 motto printed on our currency -- is " e pluribus unum " : out of many , one			2
the new building , and the process that led to its creation , is quintessentially @entity155 , right to the peak of its spire , specifically designed to soar exactly 1,776 feet in the air , a nod to the year we broke from @entity2 domination in the founding act of @entity155 audacity			1
@entity1 , a @entity2 citizen , seems to have missed or misunderstood the symbolism , and much else , in his short time in @entity7			1
needless to say , the democratically generated blend of culture and commerce at the @entity185 -- which draws millions of visitors , dwarfing any audience @entity1 is likely to have -- will stand as a monument to our values and drive long after sarcastic visiting artists have moved on			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity194 : street artist @entity1 published rant *slamming* @entity13
he says for a city that made *cooperation* , compromise part of design process , that 's too much
he says building reflects many visions , rises 1776 feet to reflect year @entity155 broke from @entity2
" 104 floors of compromise ? " asks @entity1 . well , yes , says @entity194 -- he missed the point
