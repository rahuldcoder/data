-- the second of two new research probes successfully entered the moon 's orbit sunday afternoon , a day after its companion , @entity1 announced			1
the unmanned @entity10 ( @entity11 ) fired its main engines at 5:05 p.m. and slipped into lunar orbit 39 minutes later , controllers at the space agency 's @entity8 reported			1
its companion grail - a probe arrived on saturday			1
" cheers in @entity8 mission control as everything is looking good for @entity24 , " the @entity17 , @entity18 , laboratory announced on its @entity20 page			0
" it 's going to be a great 2012 ! " @entity1 says the twin orbiters will study the moon " in unprecedented detail " from a near pole - to - pole orbit about 34 miles ( 55 km ) high			1
for an expected 82 days , their instruments will chart the lunar gravitational field , giving scientists a peek into what goes on beneath the surface -- and possibly an insight into how the @entity38 and its neighbors formed			2
both probes were launched aboard a single rocket from @entity43 's @entity42 on september 10			0
the @entity44 manned missions of the 1960s and 1970s took only three days to cross the 250,000 - mile distance from @entity38 to the moon			0
but the grail probes took more than three months and covered more than 2.5 million miles " reshaping and merging their orbits " so that they could be better positioned and coordinated to study the moon , @entity1 said			1
@entity53 , principal investigator for @entity11 , said the moon remains mysterious in many ways			0
scientists theorize that the moon formed when a @entity57 - sized object crashed into @entity38 , but it remains unknown why the near side of the moon is so different from the far side			0
the basins are flooded with volcanic material on one side , and the other side has mountainous highlands			0
" we think the answer is locked in the interior , " @entity53 said at a @entity1 news briefing wednesday .			2

@entity1 's grail - b space probe slipped into lunar orbit sunday afternoon
its companion probe arrived saturday after a nearly four - month *voyage*
