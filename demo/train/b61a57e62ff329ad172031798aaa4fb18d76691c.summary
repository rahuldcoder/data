it 's not unusual for men to join the fight for women 's rights			1
but it is if they choose to wear miniskirts while they do it			2
the brutal murder of a @entity11 woman , @entity10 , 20 , who allegedly fought off a sexual assault before her body was burned and dumped in a riverbed , has sparked protests on the street and social media			1
the @entity19 hashtag # @entity20 prompted thousands of tweets , with many women posting photos of themselves clad in black			2
and in recent days , # ozgecanicinminietekgiy , translated as " wear a miniskirt for @entity27 , " has begun circulating , often accompanied with a photo of a man wearing a short skirt			2
and it apparently does n't matter where the apparel came from , as long as it is worn			0
some were not afraid to admit their reservations about the method of protest , but still voiced their full support for the message			0
prominent @entity11 lawyer and activist @entity40 said the skirt protest is " very effective " and the first time women 's rights have been so widely endorsed in @entity11			1
" the women 's movement is trying to tell society , ' my dress is not an excuse for your rape or sexual harassment			1
' but society did n't want to hear these voices			0
" people try to find excuses for rapes and killings			0
but they did n't find any in this case , because @entity58 was very innocent , purely innocent			0
the protest shows that a short skirt is not an excuse for rape			0
" women 's rights in @entity11 have been the subject of much debate in recent years			1
in december last year , @entity66 signed an agreement along with @entity11 conglomerate @entity69 's ceo , @entity68 , to strengthen women 's economic and social empowerment in the country			1
and in 2011 , @entity11 was among 14 countries to ratify a @entity74 aiming to combat violence against women			1
but official statistics strongly suggest the need for reform			0
in a joint statement last week , representatives from @entity66 and @entity81 said : " notwithstanding the progress in @entity11 legislation and institutional structuring , recent data on violence against women shows insignificant improvement since 2008 and violence against women is still pervasive with two out of every five women in @entity11 exposed to sexual and physical violence			1
" president @entity92 , who condemned @entity58 's murder on @entity19 , was criticized for claiming at an event last year that men and women are not equal			1
" at least five women are killed a day , " says @entity40 , citing a figure originally stated by @entity98 , the deputy chairwoman of the @entity100 branch of the @entity101			0
@entity40 argues that the government 's attitude is the first factor that needs to change , as it only views women as mothers			2
" our president and government are saying to society everyday that they do not believe in women and men 's equality ; woman is [ seen as ] @entity117 's gift to man , the man protects the woman			1
" they try to make these ideas all of society 's ideas			0
but some women and men are resisting now			2
" some , though , have questioned the wider significance of the miniskirt protest			0
" i do n't know how effective it is , " @entity130 - based journalist @entity129 told @entity1			0
" it 's obviously a clever protest , @entity11 men showing their feminine side			1
whether it 's going to move @entity11 society , i do n't know			1
" reaction to the death has been massive			0
the miniskirt protest is not the main event in that protest -- it 's not as if every man on @entity11 streets is now wearing a miniskirt			1
" whereas the reaction to this woman 's death has been very substantial , and has made a lot of people think about their political attitudes			0
" he adds that the murder has invoked a host of different reactions in @entity11 people , proving both divisive and unifying			1
" a society like @entity11 is so polarized between supporters and opponents of the government -- a snowdrop does n't fall without some political significance and dividing people into political clans			2
" with 69 % of men in paid work in @entity11 compared to 29 % of women , more women in the workplace is a good place to start establishing gender equality , says @entity129			1
" personal savings [ in @entity11 ] are low because you do n't have more than one earner in the household			2
there 's a drive to get women into real jobs			2
if you get more women into employment , you have to change social rules which objectify and discriminate against women			0
" although there are deeper issues involved , the miniskirt protest has raised awareness and challenged views			0
" the real problem is a series of attitudes that have now been ingrained in the courts and in patriarchal society			0
some people have begun to reconsider those and i guess the skirt protest is just one way of calling on @entity11 men to reconsider their attitudes , " says @entity129			1
" [ the miniskirt protest is ] small but i think the symbolic meaning is very good , " says @entity40 .			0
