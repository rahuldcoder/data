-- two men held in the @entity4 may have been trying to test @entity2 airport security by putting bottles with electronic devices attached in checked baggage , a @entity2 law enforcement source said monday			1
the men were taken into custody after landing in @entity12 on a flight from @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity4 prosecutors said			1
both men were being held at @entity12 's @entity12 at the request of @entity4 national police , airport spokesman @entity16 said			1
the @entity2 @entity20 said they were arrested after " suspicious items " in their luggage raised concern			2
" the items were not deemed to be dangerous in and of themselves , and as we share information with our international partners , @entity4 authorities were notified of the suspicious items , " the @entity2 agency said			2
" this matter continues to be under investigation			0
" those items were an empty shampoo bottle with watches attached to it and an empty bottle of a stomach medicine with mobile phones attached , according to the @entity2 law enforcement source , who has been briefed on the investigation			1
that has raised concern that the men may have been testing a future terrorist plot , the source said			2
attempts to sneak liquid explosives aboard jetliners were at the heart of a 2006 plot broken up by @entity53 authorities			0
that case led @entity2 authorities to ban all but small quantities of liquids from aircraft cabins			0
@entity2 law enforcement officials told @entity0 that the checked bags contained knives and box cutters as well			0
passengers have been banned from carrying those items on aircraft since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity67 and @entity68			2
the source identified the men aboard @entity71 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , to @entity12 , as @entity72 and @entity73			2
@entity75 began his trip by boarding a flight in @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 originally flew from @entity81 , @entity82 , the law enforcement source said			0
another @entity2 law enforcement official said both men were in the @entity2 legally , but their countries of origin were not immediately known			0
that official said neither of the passengers were carrying items that are barred from aircraft , and federal air marshals were aboard the @entity14 - to - @entity12 flight			1
however , the law enforcement source said @entity72 was ticketed for a flight that went to @entity68 's @entity96 , with continuing stops in @entity98 and @entity99 , while both he and @entity80 were aboard the @entity14 - to - @entity12 flight			1
@entity75 's luggage went aboard the @entity14 - to - @entity68 flight without him , the source said , in what amounted to another violation of @entity2 safety protocols			1
a @entity2 government official said items in at least one of the bags were being examined by law enforcement authorities at @entity96 on monday night			0
the official said @entity72 and @entity80 were seated near each other on the @entity14 - to - @entity12 flight , but were not seated next to each other			1
authorities are still looking into whether the men were traveling together or simply had similar itineraries , the official said			0
@entity0 's @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
