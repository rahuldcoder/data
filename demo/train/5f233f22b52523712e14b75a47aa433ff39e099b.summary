editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			2
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- last year , @entity23 went to @entity24 , the world 's premier meeting of circuit benders , music hackers , and broken speak n ' spells			1
we spent a day at 81 front st. in @entity30 , where hackers young and old , expert and amateur , came to break electronics in order to put them back together again , in the @entity38 spirit of groups like @entity40 and musicians like @entity42 and @entity43			1
at night , a healthy roster of chiptune musicians and others made music with their homemade gear			1
our visit last year started out as an average saturday at the @entity30 , @entity7 outlet of @entity53 's @entity52 , an @entity55 retailer and repair specialist			1
well - groomed arty - types came in , alone , in couples , with lattes in hand , all there to admire the shiny wares or bring in their dead laptop for repair			0
the air was quiet , calm , tinged with some nail biting concern about lost files , perhaps , but mainly confident			0
in other words , no sign of the kind of melee happening in the art space just across the street , where the @entity24 , the annual circus of the art of " circuit bending , " was happening			1
there , scattered impromptu groups of hardware hackers were tearing their gadgets apart , literally , in an attempt to do their own kind of fixing			1
their only assistance came from men in worn t - shirts and beards whose advice consisted mainly of how to solder circuits together and the best way to break open plastic cases			0
to open one piece of electronics , someone resorted to simply throwing it at the floor , again and again , until its tiny tinny speaker started making death groans			0
( later , he would add a new , louder speaker , and make it make stranger sounds			2
) @entity103 would have been scandalized			0
the gadgets in question were n't the sleek new phones and laptops being serviced across the street , but mainly plastic kids ' toys from the 1980s , built in @entity111 cheaply and at breakneck speed			2
just as quickly had they been forgotten and trashed , which partly explained their presence , in various states of disassembly , on the workbenches			0
but apart from being cheap and easy to hack ( the smaller and sleeker gadgets have become , the harder they have become to break apart ) , these all had another thing going for them : they made beeping sounds			2
if you 're really lucky , some of them , like the @entity126 , even talk			0
crack open a toy walkie talkie or a generic mini keyboard , rip off the coverings ( sometimes there 's even scotch tape inside ) , press a button , and simply lick a finger and touch a circuit			1
a short will cause the beep to become a bleeooooop , or a danger to become a dddddreeerrrrrrrrr			0
wire an output to the speaker wire , plug in an amp , and you 've got an outer - space music box fit for an intense audio - visual extravaganza			2
watch @entity147 : the @entity24 at @entity9 while beginners and more expert circuit benders tinkered in workshops , small bands of musicians were huddled in the corners , preparing their homemade instruments for an all - out exposition of exploded instruments			1
at one point near the end of the night , a musician called @entity161 ( and introduced as " the handsomer @entity162 , " though that would only barely approximate his sound ) , began his set by excitedly rallying the audience the only way that would have made sense -- inviting them up to play his instruments			0
my hand shot up before he was finished asking , and soon it was on a keyboard , on a @entity175 knockoff , and there were all the other hands surrounding the table 's electronic feast , bathing in the torrent of sound and light and energy of our own creation			1
it was n't just the most fun i 'd had at a concert in a while ; it was the best kind of fun			0
like the toys we were all playing , the music came in all shapes and sizes , in bright colors and from another world			0
the best part : the musicians , like everyone else , were n't just pressing buttons to get them to play music			1
they were making the buttons themselves			0
see more coverage from last year 's festival and an introduction to circuit bending before this year 's events start			1
@entity24 2011 starts june 23rd and runs until june 25th			1
