-- when rock groups announce that they 're going on " indefinite hiatus , " usually it 's publicist - speak for " do n't hold your breath that they 're ever coming back			1
" but @entity7 beat the odds when they announced that they 'd secretly recorded a new album , their first since going on " indefinite hiatus " in 2009			1
tagged with the tongue - in - cheek title " @entity13 , " the disc promptly shot to the top of the @entity16 album chart and debuted at number one on @entity18 in 27 countries			1
@entity0 recently spoke with singer @entity20 , bassist @entity21 , guitarist @entity22 and drummer @entity23 about their surprise reunion			0
@entity0 : we thought you guys were on " indefinite hiatus			1
" @entity21 : well , it 's ended			1
@entity20 : we did just genuinely mean that we were just going to take a break , like it 's supposed to be			1
@entity22 : i think a lot of people do n't understand that we were kids and that some of us grew up in this band , and we needed a little time away from the band			1
we may have been in our mid- 20s or early 30s , but we still felt like we were 17 , so we kind of needed to catch up to being whatever age we were by the end			0
@entity0 : how did you manage to record the new album in secret ? @entity20 : there were n't a lot of people knocking down our doors , going , " when 's the next @entity7 record ? " that was n't a thing that we were really getting pelted with , so we did n't really have any expectations to live up to			1
@entity23 : which is nice , because then you make something that you 're happy with , and you do n't have to do something for this group of people , which is a great way to do it			1
@entity0 : your first single is called " @entity62			1
" @entity21 : the video is pretty cool			0
it has our buddy ( rapper ) @entity68 in it , basically burning a lot of stuff -- which seemed apt in some way			1
@entity73 is in his second act , and i think he learned so much from the first time around that he has a total other perspective than a lot of others have			1
you do n't see a lot of artists in any genre who are on time and prepared to work			0
i think that 's something you get with the benefit of hindsight a little bit			1
@entity0 : what are you doing differently this time around ? @entity21 : i think that there was a lot of " ready , fire , aim " stuff that would go on			0
it was kind of like , " oh , we 've got to the do this right now , " and now i think that we realize it 's not so much quantity and constantly saying , " yes			2
" there 's the power of " no " and doing things the way that you want to do it and making sure quality is the most important aspect			2
i think at the end of the day , that 's what determines your legacy			2
you can either be a fast food restaurant or you can be making art , and i do n't want to flip burgers , really			0
@entity0 : how 's the communication in the group these days ? @entity22 : guys are notoriously bad at emoting and communicating , and i think we had to learn how to do that			1
but also taking that time apart to be with our families , do other projects , work with different people and experience different things allowed us to come back and realize that maybe we did this thing not so well ; maybe we should have talked more ; maybe we should n't have been so passive - aggressive ; maybe this guy should have voiced his opinion more			0
i think we are better at that , and it has been very healthy for the band			2
@entity0 : @entity22 , you and @entity20 got married			0
how have your personal lives changed things ? @entity22 : it changes your perspective			0
we had to pay attention to these people who have been supporting us for so long , have been waiting for us while we 've been on the road , and i think they 've been waiting long enough			0
@entity21 : i took my kid to preschool today , and he has a friend who is really into music there -- this little kid -- and he was like , " i want to play @entity7 right now			1
" and my kid was like , " i do n't			0
i want to play @entity149			0
" ( laughter ) that will keep you grounded			0
@entity0 : " @entity13 " just debuted at no. 1 on the @entity16 album chart			1
it also went no. 1 on @entity18 in 27 countries			0
how mind - blowing is this ? coming back , we never thought something like that was even possible			0
at the end of the day , we just put the music out there in the world			0
we are humbled and thankful for the world 's reaction			2
@entity0 : @entity7 will be embarking on an arena tour later this year			1
@entity21 : we just announced that we 're taking our buddies @entity169 on tour with us this fall in arenas			0
a bunch of those -- like @entity174 's in @entity175 -- are almost sold out , so make sure you get your tickets so we can hang out and be weird together			2
@entity20 : on the subject of arena tours , it 's interesting			2
sometimes i 'll talk to fans , and there 's always these different perspectives of " i like the big rooms " or " i like the small rooms			2
" @entity21 : if you 're bummed about the arena tour , you 're going to be real bummed about the stadium tour ! ( laughter )			0
