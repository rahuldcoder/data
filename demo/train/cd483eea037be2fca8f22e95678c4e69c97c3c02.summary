-- @entity1 , a 19th century outlaw , is remembered in historical accounts as a notorious criminal who terrorized southern @entity5			1
but one school district in @entity5 wants to remember him another way : as a hero to the @entity10 community who fought back against injustice			1
the @entity13 set off a controversy last month when it announced that an elementary school in @entity16 to be opened this year will be named after @entity1			1
the move has led some local leaders , including the @entity16 mayor , to criticize the controversial choice			0
" we had a young man killed in @entity22 who was from the @entity24 area			0
he would have been a nice person to name the school after , " mayor @entity25 said wednesday			2
" there 's a lot of good people we could name a school after , in my opinion			2
" according to a biography culled together by the @entity34 , @entity1 was " probably the most notorious bandit @entity5 ever saw			1
" @entity1 turned to a life of crime as a teenager and served time in @entity39 for stealing horses in the late 1850s , the biography states			1
he and his gang went into hiding in the canyons of @entity5 after a " string of infamous robberies and murders " in 1873 , the biography says			1
@entity1 eventually was captured , convicted of murder and hanged			1
his does n't sound like a life to be emulated , but there is another side to his life story , said @entity53 , a retired school teacher and member of the naming committee in the @entity56			2
@entity1 was a standout student from a very distinguished family , @entity53 said			1
they had extensive land that was snatched from them after @entity5 became part of the @entity62			1
" the community does not see @entity1 as a thief or a murderer , " @entity53 said			1
" we see him as a fighter for social justice of the @entity70 - @entity69 whose rights have been deprived			0
" @entity53 said he believes that @entity1 was falsely accused of murder			2
an account of @entity1 's life , written in 1948 by the @entity75 of @entity5 , also hints at a more noble side of the bandit			1
" it was well known that @entity1 was not a killer , that he repeatedly warned his followers not to kill , and his reluctance to take life , even when his own was in grave danger , was without doubt responsible for the remarkably few killings during his 23 years as an outlaw , " the article said			2
the article continued : " he hated the @entity87 with good reason and always in his mind was a thought , which had activated many of his race before him , that he could help get the @entity62 out and in some way regain @entity5 for @entity70			2
" both narratives of his life , whatever his motivations were , remain controversial			0
@entity98 superintendent @entity97 , who oversees the @entity13 , said naming decisions fall solely to the local school board			0
@entity97 questioned the choice of name			0
" this is an elementary school , pre-school to grade 6			0
the appropriate procedure would be to first clarify the historical record before naming a school after a controversial figure , " she said			0
in a statement , the county @entity111 cited high rates of youth violence and murder in @entity16			0
@entity53 called it " ridiculous " to link the name of the new school to violence in the community			0
" what the mainstream calls a murderer and a thief was actually an outstanding individual who was highly educated , cultured and embraced the fine arts , " he said			0
the school , which is scheduled to open in the fall , would not be the first institution to be named after @entity1			1
a clinic in @entity131 that provides care for the uninsured is called the @entity134 .			0

a new school in @entity5 is being named after a famous bandit
@entity1 is said to have been a notorious criminal
supporters of the name say he stood up for *marginalized* *hispanics*
