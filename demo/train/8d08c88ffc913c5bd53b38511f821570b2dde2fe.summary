-- what if the same number of young people who serve in our armed forces , defending the country , were enlisted to go on offense here at home , fighting persistent but solvable national problems -- the dropout crisis , national parks in need of restoration , and childhood hunger ? it 's a big idea , one that could make a period of service -- either military or civilian -- a civic rite of passage for @entity23 's young people			1
this week , the @entity24 , an initiative of the @entity26 , released a " @entity29 " to establish a large - scale 21st century system for voluntary national service			1
sparked by a stirring speech by gen. @entity32 at the @entity33 last year , the plan calls for establishing 1 million full - time service opportunities every year for young adults , ages 18 to 28 , putting domestic national service on par with the more than 1 million @entity23 on active duty in our armed forces			1
it 's a plan that is strongly endorsed not only by nonprofit , philanthropic and private sector leaders , but also people who have dedicated their lives to our national security , including former @entity46 @entity47 and @entity48 , former secretary of defense @entity49 , former national security advisor gen. @entity50 , and @entity32 , who is chairman of the initiative 's leadership council			2
linking military and civilian service as " two sides of the same coin " is perhaps the @entity24 's most resonant chord			2
a vibrant nation requires a shared sense of commitment and shared experience of service and sacrifice			0
but as @entity64 observes , " less than 1 % of @entity23 serve in the militaryâ € ” a historic low during wartimeâ € ” leading to a broad , complacent assumption that serving the nation is someone else 's job			0
" the plan calls for expanding federal programs that are already working , including @entity70 , and generating energy behind new ideas			1
for example , the plan proposes that president @entity74 ask all federal agencies to examine how they might tap citizens in service to meet their missions			2
@entity79 is already saving $ 60 million by utilizing national service participants to respond to disasters			1
we can also expand the opportunities provided by the @entity84 to encourage veterans to continue their service at home -- in schools and community centers -- so the nation can continue to benefit from their dedication to a greater cause			2
the demand for opportunities to serve has been growing dramatically			0
in 2011 , @entity70 received 582,000 applications for only 80,000 positions , and the @entity98 received 150,000 applications for 4,000 full - time placements			1
there is an overwhelming desire among the rising millennial generation to give back			0
missing are clear pathways and opportunities to serve			0
as recent polling demonstrates , four in five voters support voluntary national service			1
the " @entity29 " calls for tapping this wellspring of @entity23 idealism to meet pressing national challenges			2
high on the list is the nation 's dropout crisis			1
each year , more than a million students fail to graduate with their senior class			0
dropouts are eight times more likely to be incarcerated , and three times more likely to be unhealthy or unemployed			0
absent effective intervention , the 10 million students who are projected to drop out in the next decade will cost the nation $ 3 trillion in lost wages , health care expenses , welfare benefits and incarceration costs			0
the good news is that research has shown that future dropouts can be identified , as early as the sixth grade , by early warning signs such as high absence rate , poor behaviors and getting an " f " in math or @entity135			0
what 's needed to close the gap ? more people power			0
" we 've seen the power of having young adults serve in our school through @entity70 , " said @entity140 superintendent of schools @entity141			0
" when a student does n't show up to school , they get them back in			0
when they 're behind academically , they help catch them up			0
these young people bring an infectious energy and idealism that makes a huge difference			1
the only problem is that we do n't have enough of them -- we need to scale up national service and tap more young people to give a year of service			1
it 's a resource you ca n't put a price tag on			0
" the @entity24 's " @entity29 " has a powerful response : calling for 120,000 young people to serve as full - time tutors and mentors in the nation 's " dropout factories : " the lowest - performing high schools and the elementary and middle schools			1
it is just one example of how young people , perhaps the nation 's greatest untapped resource , can help @entity23 succeed			1
one day , the most commonly asked question of a young adult can and should be , " where will you give your year of service ? " the answer to that question is the key to our nation 's future success			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 and @entity195 .			1
