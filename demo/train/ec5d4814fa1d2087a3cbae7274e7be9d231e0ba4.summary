-- " if power plants , waste handling , chemical plants and transport systems were located in wealthy areas as quickly and easily as in poor areas , we would have had a clean , green economy decades ago			0
" -- @entity8 , @entity9 2007 it was while walking her dog that @entity12 stumbled upon the disused stretch of waterfront that inspired her to act @entity8 grew up in the @entity16 at a time when @entity19 's cities were emptying into the suburbs			1
many of the buildings in her neighborhood were abandoned by the time she was ten years old			2
landlords were burning their buildings to collect the insurance ; light manufacturing industries were moving out of the @entity16 ; and waste facilities were moving in to take their place			1
as pollution rose , asthma rates , poor health and unemployment soared			0
to outsiders , those who were left were branded with the stamp of the ghetto : as @entity12 says , " if you lived here you were no doubt a pimp , a pusher , or a prostitute			2
" as a child , @entity12 spent much of her time planning her escape			1
" education was my way out , " she reveals			0
she studied cinema studies and film production at @entity49 then signed up for graduate school at @entity51			0
to save money , she moved home to her parents			0
of that time , she says , " it felt like a defeat but it was also the best thing in the world to happen to me because i got reacquainted with my community			2
" @entity12 saw that her neighborhood -- under - served , ignored and literally dumped on -- needed to fight a positive campaign to assert itself as a vibrant community			1
" people wanted things like clean air , they wanted safe places for their kids to play where they would n't get hit by a truck , " she tells @entity0			0
" they wanted living wage jobs that did n't degrade the environment or kill them			0
" she fought a vociferous campaign against a planned waste facility that would have seen 40 percent of @entity78 's municipal waste coming to the @entity16			2
" we were already handling 40 percent of the city 's commercial waste here , " she says			0
in 2001 , after the defeat of the scheme , @entity12 founded the non-profit environmental justice solutions corporation , @entity84			1
its central tenet is that people should n't have to move out of their neighborhoods to live in a better one			0
while walking her dog one day , @entity12 stumbled upon a disused stretch of waterfront			1
that inspired her to write a tenacious $ 1.25 million federal transportation planning grant for the @entity97			1
the 11 - mile - long stretch is the first new @entity16 waterfront park in over 60 years and provides alternative transport , recreational space , jobs and environmental enhancements to the local community			1
in 2003 , @entity84 started an urban green - collar training scheme			1
many of the course 's graduates were formerly incarcerated ; all were receiving some form of public handout			0
the scheme now boasts an 85 percent employment rate , in areas like urban forestry , brown - field clean - up , green roof installation and maintenance			0
ultimately , @entity12 would like to see her organization " worked out of a job			2
" she believes that , with the right partnerships , the @entity16 could be transformed into the thriving neighborhood her parents once knew			1
@entity12 has now handed the day - to - day management of @entity84 to her colleagues , allowing her to spread her messages of environmental justice and regeneration through green industry to others			1
" we 've got to decide that we want to live in a world that is sane and happy and healthy , and that everyone deserves that , " she says .			0
