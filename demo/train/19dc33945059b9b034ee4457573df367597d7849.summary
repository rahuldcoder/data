-- @entity2 @entity1 ban ki - moon urged developed nations to " lead by example " wednesday as a climate change conference bogged down over support for poor nations trying to adapt to a warming world			1
the two - week conference in @entity12 's capital , @entity13 , opened with a hunger strike by the top delegate from the typhoon - battered @entity16 to demand concrete action toward a new global pact on climate change			1
but with two days of talks left , participants said countries remained split on the big issues			1
" next year will require a lot of heavy lifting if we are to remain on track for an agreement in 2015 , " @entity25 said wednesday			2
he called on countries to put their money where their mouths were by devoting more funding to deal with climate change and the carbon emissions blamed for causing it			1
" the developed countries have great capacity and should lead by example , " @entity25 said			1
" science is telling us we need to do more			1
economists are highlighting the huge cost of inaction			2
businesspeople want the signals from government that will create the right incentives to build a low - carbon future , " he added			2
the @entity13 conference brings together countries that have signed onto the @entity56 to review their progress in limiting global temperature increases			1
but this year 's meeting has been discouraging for advocates of aggressive action to limit carbon emissions and rein in a projected increase in global average temperatures			2
@entity66 's new conservative government recently announced plans to repeal a carbon tax aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions			0
@entity70 announced last week it would n't meet its stated emissions targets , citing the replacement of nuclear power plants idled after the 2011 meltdown at @entity75 with fossil fuel generation			0
@entity77 made a similar announcement in october			0
a study released tuesday by researchers at @entity82 's @entity81 found greenhouse gas emissions will top 39 billion tons in 2013			0
the rate of increase has slowed , but the improvement is a drop in the bucket by global standards			0
@entity12 environment minister @entity90 , the @entity13 conference 's president , lost his job in a @entity94 shuffle on wednesday			1
but @entity90 told delegates that prime minister @entity96 is keeping him on as president of the conference and as a government official responsible for climate policy			1
delegates from developing countries staged a three - hour walkout early wednesday to protest what @entity104 , a member of @entity106 's delegation , called a " stalemate " over how to compensate their nations for climate - related losses			1
@entity104 said negotiators had gone back into the talks wednesday night , but added , " unless and until everything is agreed , then nothing is agreed			0
" but @entity115 , the head of the @entity117 delegation , said the talks ended " with everybody leaving " after " businesslike and productive " discussions			0
" i do n't see this negotiation blowing up over that , " he said			0
" i think we will find a resolution , but we 're still some distance apart			0
" an october study in the scientific journal @entity127 noted that more than 5 billion people live in areas that would be affected by climate change by 2050 , and the countries that will first see its effects are the ones least capable of responding			1
@entity2 members have committed to setting up a $ 100 billion - a - year fund to deal with climate change			2
but @entity136 of the @entity117 - based environmental group @entity137 said global subsidies for fossil fuel industries already top $ 500 billion and some estimates run as much as $ 2 trillion			0
" there is plenty of money there , " @entity136 said			0
" it 's just going in the wrong direction for the moment			0

" science is telling us we need to do more , " @entity149 tells climate conference
@entity13 conference split between developed and developing nations
