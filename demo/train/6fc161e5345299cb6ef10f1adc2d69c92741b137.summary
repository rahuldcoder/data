-- five decades ago , @entity1 and three fellow african - american college students made history just by sitting down at a @entity5 's lunch counter in @entity6 , @entity7 , and waiting			1
and waiting -- for service that never came that day at the whites - only counter			1
the four came back the next day			0
the " @entity14 , " as they came to be known , drew national attention with their peaceful demonstration in the winter of 1960			2
within three days of their first attempt to simply sit and eat , more than 300 students , including whites , were taking part in what was being called " a sit - in " in @entity6			1
nearly six months later , with similar sit - ins happening at dozens of whites - only lunch counters in @entity29 cities , the counter where it all started served its first black customers			1
@entity1 died thursday after a brief illness , according to his alma mater , @entity32			1
he died in a hospital a few miles from the old @entity5 's location -- now the nonprofit @entity35 , which opened 50 years to the day @entity1 and his colleagues began their sit - in on february 1 , 1960			1
the museum posted on its site a tribute to @entity1 and the other three students for their " courageous act ( that ) marked a turning point in the struggle for equality that continues to this day			1
" @entity1 , 72 , graduated from @entity32 in 1964 , and worked for a chemical company , the @entity46 , in @entity47 for almost 35 years , according to the @entity48			2
he was a member of the @entity7 university system 's board of governors and was active in civil rights throughout his life , according to @entity32			0
" his contributions to this university , the city of @entity6 and the nation as a civil rights leader are without measure			0
his legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of @entity66 and friends throughout the world , " a&t chancellor @entity59 said in a statement posted on the university 's website			0
in 2010 , @entity1 told @entity0 of his concern when an elderly white woman approached the lunch counter that day			1
" i was thinking to myself , she must have knitting needles and scissors in that handbag of hers and they 're about to go right through me , " said @entity1 , a bespectacled freshman at the time			2
instead of pulling a knitting needle on the young men , the woman placed her hand on @entity1 's shoulder and smiled warmly			0
" she says , ' boys , i am so proud of you			0
i only regret that you did n't do this 10 years ago , ' " @entity1 said			0
" that was the greatest source of inspiration to me , probably for all my life , primarily because it came from a very unexpected person , " he said			0
" you picture 1960 in the @entity29 in a little old white lady 's space and you are acting out of place , and she compliments you			0
" another member of the four , @entity14 , also spoke with @entity0 on the 50th anniversary of the sit - in and said the planned action grew out of lifetimes of personal experiences with segregation			1
" unless we decided to do something about it and took some action , our children would have had to also challenge racial segregation , " said @entity14 , a retired major general in the @entity100			1
" @entity5 's was a national chain , and what we fundamentally wanted to do was to bring attention to the negative , and the evil of segregation			0
" in addition to @entity1 and @entity14 , the @entity14 were @entity114 -- then known as @entity114 -- and @entity115			2
@entity116 died in 1990 at age 49 , according to the @entity118			0
speaking of @entity1 as news of his death spread , @entity114 told the @entity122 , " @entity123 would say we did n't want to set the world on fire , we just wanted to sit down and eat like everybody else			2
we wanted to be included in the round table of humanity			1
" people we 've lost in 2014 @entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 , who died thursday , was one of the " @entity14 "

" we wanted to be included in the round table of humanity , " said another of the four
