-- if you had tried to visit @entity2 when he was alive , you would have been greeted by a warning sign proclaiming " snakes ! snakes ! mice ! " on the path to his studio on @entity8 , a peninsula in @entity9 , @entity10			1
while @entity11 entertained dignitaries at home in @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 and @entity17 were famous for welcoming @entity18 , @entity19 and other guests to their homes in @entity22 , @entity2 and other artists were considerably less accommodating			1
we can only wonder what the notoriously private @entity2 and @entity25 would say about their studios in @entity10 and @entity29 being opened to visitors for the first time this year			1
if you 've been admiring your favorite painter 's work in a museum , you 've only been seeing part of the picture			1
for the full view , you must visit the artist 's home and studio			1
there you 'll see where and how he lived and worked ; what she saw when she looked out her window			0
@entity51 carefully decorated or intentionally uncluttered , artists ' homes and studios show us who they were at the core			0
" everything in her house reflects @entity61 's taste and personality , " says @entity55 , director of the @entity56 in @entity22			1
" it is like a piece of art , decorated entirely by @entity61 ... her personal universe			2
" here are six destinations where you can explore the personal universes of several renowned artists			0
6 spots for architecture lovers @entity73 , @entity10 @entity2 's " snakes ! snakes ! mice ! " sign was the artist 's way of scaring away the " rusticators " -- city folk who summered in this private enclave 12 miles south of @entity82 , @entity10			1
expect a warmer welcome when the @entity73 opens to the public september 25 after a six - year restoration overseen by the @entity85 @entity2 lived and worked at @entity8 from 1883 until his death in 1910 , completing paintings such as " @entity88 " and " the @entity89			1
" he left his mark on the place in countless ways , including traces of graffiti on the walls and his signature scratched into the window glass			0
at the @entity85 , the companion exhibition " @entity98 : @entity2 and @entity10 " ( september 22 - december 30 ) showcases @entity2 's paintings of the area			1
a local @entity102 offers discounted admission to area attractions including scenic ferry cruises on @entity106 , the @entity107 and the @entity108			0
8 religious wonders in the @entity110 @entity25 and @entity111 , @entity29 like the quiet beauty of his paintings , @entity25 's studio in @entity113 , @entity29 , puts visitors in a meditative mood			1
the intensely private artist did n't share this space with many people , but after his death in 2009 , his wife , @entity121 , gave the simple white former schoolhouse building to the @entity124			2
it opened for docent - led tours in july			2
@entity25 painted here from 1940 until 2008 , and the tools of his trade remain much as he might have placed them : brushes , sketches , even the eggs and pigments he used to mix the tempera for paintings such as " @entity138 " and " @entity139 " are now in the museum 's collection			2
the studio of @entity143 , @entity25 's father , has a different feeling			1
built with earnings from his illustrations for the 1911 @entity148 's edition of " @entity149 , " @entity143 's studio is filled with props he used in his robust illustrations , including a birch bark canoe and a wooden horse on which models posed for @entity156 pictures			1
the @entity157 , which extends from southeastern @entity29 to @entity158 , retains much of the rural character that so appealed to the @entity160			0
@entity161 in @entity29 and @entity162 in @entity158 are pretty places for nature walks , day - hikes , canoeing and horseback riding			2
@entity167 , @entity168 it took more than 10 years for @entity170 to convince the local @entity172 diocese to sell her a crumbling hacienda in @entity175 , @entity168 , overlooking the @entity176			0
@entity175 's cottonwood trees inspired her , the fertile soil and abundant garden pleased her and the views captivated her			2
@entity170 finally prevailed in 1945 and , after a complete renovation supervised by her friend @entity183 , she moved to @entity175 in 1949 and stayed until 1984			0
located about 55 miles from @entity184 , the @entity167 is managed by the @entity185 in @entity184			0

nearby areas of natural beauty and historic interest are the @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 ( still recovering from fire and floods in 2011 ) and the @entity210 pueblos and villages throughout the state			0
@entity214 and @entity215 homes and studios , @entity217 @entity218 in southern @entity217 is @entity214 's town			2
brimming with relaxed charm , it almost begs you to pick up a paintbrush -- and many visitors do			2
most also visit @entity214 's picture - perfect atelier			1
built in 1901 and surrounded by leafy grounds , the sparsely furnished studio is where @entity214 worked late in his life			2
nearby are the @entity214 family 's @entity230 estate and the @entity233 quarries , both of which feature in his paintings			2
( the men pictured in @entity214 's " @entity239 " series were workers on the estate			2
) the @entity218 @entity242 offers guided tours of the three sites and a map for self - guided @entity214 tours of the city			2
@entity218 itself is a place to exhale , while wandering in the @entity250 , beneath the arching trees of the @entity252 , or through one of the city 's famed outdoor markets			2
@entity256 in northern @entity217 belongs to @entity215			0
the " father of impressionism " lived and worked there from 1883 to 1926 , after spying the town from the door of a train as he traveled from @entity262 to @entity263			0
his house , built in 1890 , is spacious and prettily furnished			0
( when @entity215 was alive , it also would have been very noisy , with his eight children running around			0
) among the highlights indoors is his collection of @entity272 prints by masters such as @entity274 and @entity275			0
outdoors , of course , are @entity215 's legendary gardens and the ponds dotted with water lilies and spanned by a @entity272 bridge			0
just 45 minutes by train from @entity283 , @entity256 is a day - trip destination , but it 's also a gateway to medieval @entity286 with its magnificent cathedral and ties to @entity289 , and to other sites in @entity291 , such as @entity292 and @entity293			1
@entity16 and @entity294 , @entity168 @entity16 's singular vision is evident everywhere in @entity296 , her home and studio in @entity22 's @entity299 district			1
born in the house in 1907 , she lived there most of her life and died there in 1954			0
no place was more significant to her			0
" almost all of her paintings include an element , a corner or a piece of her house , " says museum director @entity55			0
" even the plants she had in her house are painted in her paintings			0
" @entity16 's books and her collections of @entity314 folk art and religious healing charms , or ex-votos , are cherished mementos of her life there			1
@entity16 was less attached to the @entity319 home and studio her husband , @entity17 , commissioned architect @entity323 to design for them in 1931 - 32			1
yet @entity17 loved the place , and it is where he died in 1957			0
its two @entity329 style buildings connected by an exterior catwalk were restored to their original design in the 1990s based on photos taken by @entity61 's father in 1932			0
they featured as a location in the 2002 film " @entity61			0
" ( @entity338 was recreated in a studio for the movie			0
) today they comprise the @entity342 y @entity16			1
for an excursion from @entity22 , try one of @entity61 and @entity17 's favorites , a visit to the first century @entity348 city of @entity349			1
@entity350 , @entity15 @entity11 was not your typical starving artist			1
born into a well - connected family in 1577 , at age 32 @entity11 was named court painter to @entity356 who ruled much of modern - day @entity15 at the time			1
his artistic style reflected optimism after a period of war and hardship , and his charismatic personality won him influential admirers and special privileges , such as permission to employ an unlimited number of assistants in his glorious 17th - century baroque home and studio in @entity14			1
it is @entity11 ' work we see in masterpieces such as " @entity377 " in @entity14 's @entity378 , but he had help executing his vision			1
how else could he have made the 2,500 - plus paintings attributed to him ? the process becomes clear inside his atelier , the vast workspace where assistants painted sections of individual works following sketches and notes @entity11 provided			1
meanwhile , @entity11 himself might have strolled along the gallery overlooking the atelier , probably accompanied by an illustrious client			1
@entity11 ' influence is everywhere in @entity14			1
on the modern side , @entity14 is a fashion capital , a major world diamond center and a fantastic shopping city			1
come 2013 , it will also be home to the @entity399 , a maritime and immigration museum in the @entity402 revitalized harbor district			0
