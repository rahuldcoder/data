@entity1 , gold medallist four years ago in @entity6 admitted he was " not in the right physical condition to compete " and that he had to " think about @entity8 sport			1
" the world number two , who was due to carry @entity8 's flag at the opening ceremony , had already taken two weeks off in the buildup to the @entity2 to recover from tendinitis in his knee " i 've waited until the final moment of my preparation and my training , but i can not do it , " @entity1 said in a statement released to the @entity8 press on thursday			1
" today is one of the saddest days in my career			0
carrying the flag for @entity8 at the opening ceremony was set to be one of the biggest honors , one of the most special moments for me			1
" for this reason i hope you can understand how difficult it has been for me to take this decision			0
one of my teammates who is better prepared than me can take my place and compete to the best of his ability			0
" the @entity39 announced that world number 30 @entity40 would take @entity1 's spot in the singles competition			1
@entity44 , who has won doubles titles with @entity1 on the @entity47 tour , will take his place in the doubles competition			2
