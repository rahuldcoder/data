? sounds like a cookie - cutter chick flick , for sure			0
but " @entity18 " surpasses low expectations , for this male film critic at any rate , if only because it hits on an intriguing yarn and plays it out with some respect for the characters involved			1
@entity5 is @entity19 , a young man whose blissfully happy marriage is rear - ended by a snowplow -- propelling wife @entity23 ( @entity24 ) through the windscreen and into a brain trauma unit			1
when she wakes up , she 's okay -- except that she 's wiped out the last five years entirely			0
she does n't know @entity19 , does n't remember dropping out of law school and switching to art classes , and does n't like anything she finds in her wardrobe			2
she also does n't remember cutting off her parents and her sister -- @entity19 's never even met them before -- or why she broke up with her @entity35 © , @entity36			2
amnesia often figures as a handy crutch for thriller writers who love teasing out doubt and deception , but @entity43 's movie is a different beast , a romance first and foremost , but a romance that claims to be inspired by a true story			1
@entity43 ( who directed @entity49 and @entity50 in " @entity51 " ) plays down the condition 's inherent paranoia , in part by drawing us in through the eyes of the husband , @entity19 here 's a guy who loves his wife , but who finds himself alone in the marriage because everything they shared as a couple has been erased			1
for @entity23 , home is the house she grew up in and the parents she remembers -- wealthy , privileged suburbanites who are only too keen to set back the clock and pretend their little girl never strayed across the tracks			0
an actor who finds " perplexed and concerned " well within his limited range , @entity5 is a good fit for the bruised and brooding @entity19 , and the lively @entity3 has some nice moments as the ( blank ? ) @entity23 -- but flashbacks to happier days try too hard to force a chemistry that remains more theoretical than felt			1
still , the scenario ( @entity43 is one of five credited writers ) throws up some arresting questions about the nature of love			2
how can @entity19 still be in love with this woman who is a stranger to herself ? can he make her fall back in love with him ? is it even fair to try ? because these ideas are also emotional dilemmas the movie works surprisingly well despite its shortcuts and shortcomings			2
it certainly is n't subtle about its preference for the sympathetic @entity19 -- and by extension , the vegan , tattooed , artistic @entity23 who voted for @entity98 -- over her domineering father , played by @entity100 , and the conservative values he represents -- even though the uptown scenes are generally better written and more convincingly played than what amounts to a sitcom notion of bohemian chic			0
of course it 's more than a little convenient that @entity23 never stops to ask why she walked out on the life she was groomed for -- the story 's second , hidden trauma			0
if she had , the whole construct falls apart			0
this is mostly a poignant and touching effort			0
just as @entity19 woos his estranged wife with " @entity114 " ( not a game @entity3 plays very often i 'm betting ) , given the choice between hard edges and gooey centers , @entity43 invariably heads for the fudge : it 's sweet and chewy and fun to share .			1
