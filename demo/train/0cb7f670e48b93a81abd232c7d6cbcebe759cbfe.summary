-- @entity1 has photographed 10 wars			2
he 's captured violence in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			0
but his recent week taking pictures of rebels in @entity10 was the most intense , frightening experience of his career			1
he compares it to @entity5 when he was embedded in 2010 with the @entity14			0
" if there 's a fight , the @entity16 soldiers are trained ; they 're going to protect you			1
they are skilled in combat and can fight back , " he said			0
" in @entity10 , anything goes			1
the rebels want you to tell the story , but what they do n't tell you is if something bad happens , they spread out			0
" for me , the stress level was high at all times			0
" @entity32 's photos of rebels and refugees fleeing @entity10 by dark @entity1 , a 33 - year - old @entity36 , worked with @entity38 photojournalist @entity37 , whose @entity10 contacts helped lead them across the @entity42 border into @entity10			1
they spent one week photographing rebels -- many just ordinary @entity10 who 've taken up arms -- as they battle military forces loyal to president @entity46			1
@entity10 has been locked for more than a year in a bloody conflict that began when protesters started demanding that @entity46 relinquish power			1
the movement grew out of the @entity51 , a larger phenomenon across the @entity52 and @entity53 in which @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity7 successfully protested for the removal of their leaders in 2011			0
in @entity10 , opposition forces report that as many as 10,000 people have died since march 2011			1
it 's been incredibly difficult to know for certain what is happening in @entity10 because @entity46 has banned journalists from entering the country to cover the conflict			1
several journalists who have gotten in to cover the violence have been wounded or killed			0
" i wanted to go , " he said			0
@entity1 , @entity69 and the @entity10 who helped them cross into the country had to move at night in pitch blackness , walking seven miles to a village where rebels and their families were hiding			1
they trudged over mountainous , rocky soil carrying their equipment , their heads hurting with worry that they could trip mines scattered along the border			2
" there 's a lot of fighting in the mountains			2
[ we heard ] machine - gun fire , " said @entity1			2
" the problem with that is you really do n't know what 's going on and who 's who			0
you have no idea if you 're going to be able to get out [ of @entity10 ] once you 're inside			1
" when they came to the rebels ' village , they saw houses made of stone and concrete			1
@entity1 relied on the contacts who helped them make it to the village to do the introductions			2
neither he nor @entity37 speaks @entity106			0
the villagers assumed from @entity1 's accent that he was @entity16			1
though he went to college in @entity111 and lives in @entity112 , the photographer never would have brought up his ties to the @entity114 , he said			1
" i never told anybody i have an @entity114 background			1
that 's a big no - no , " he said			2
if he had , the rebels ' families would still help him out of kindness but " they would n't like you as much			0
" " you have to remember these people are conservative muslims and @entity114 is still a problem for them , even though they wish @entity114 would help them , " he said			1
the @entity10 took to calling @entity1 " @entity126 , " the photographer said with a laugh			1
though the families were incredibly poor , they generously gave @entity1 and @entity69 a little rice , hummus and pita bread			0
@entity1 got most of his shots by using their homes as shelter			2
" you 're hiding a lot in houses and rooms , " he said			1
" you ca n't really [ for safety reasons ] get out and photograph as much as you 'd like to			0
" as the days went on , the photographer noticed that he rarely saw many rebels together at one time			2
they came by in small groups -- maybe a dozen at once			0
" that 's because they are retreating , " @entity1 said			0
" they are losing this war			0
they do n't have the equipment to stop the [ @entity153 ]			2
" he managed to photograph one rebel riding his horse as other fighters napped nearby on a woven rug , their guns propped against a concrete wall			1
@entity1 stood close to another rebel to get a shot of the young man , cigarette dangling from his mouth , pointing his gun toward an area where @entity10 snipers were positioned			1
shortly after photographing this exhausted fighter , the photojournalist started to get a bad feeling			0
his gut told him that he 'd pressed his luck enough			0
" we told our contact on the ground that we want to get out of here , " he said			0
" we said we 're done with our work			0
" @entity1 's instincts were dead on			0
just days later , the @entity10 military decimated the nearby town of @entity182 , once a rebel stronghold			1
@entity1 and @entity69 began their journey out of @entity10 by simply walking in the direction of the border , accompanied by the people who had helped get them inside the country			1
eventually they connected with their helpers ' families who were trying to flee into @entity42			1
again , they had to hike in complete darkness			0
occasionally , when the time seemed right , @entity1 asked one of the refugees to hold up a flashlight so he could take a photo			2
at one point , he captured a little boy in motion wearing a bright green sweater adorned with a heart and the word " happy			0
" one of the @entity10 fathers traveling with them had two babies and could n't both hold the infants and grasp trees as he navigated through the darkness			1
so the man handed @entity1 one of the babies and the photographer held the child as he struggled across the hilly terrain			2
the group reached a camp and were able to get in the back of a truck that drove them a final 500 yards to the @entity42 border			1
@entity1 remembers seeing the @entity42 towers come into view			2
" you 're relieved , " he said			0
" you do n't even care if the @entity42 army catches you			2
you know you 're safe by then			0

@entity16 - @entity114 photographer got into @entity10 through @entity42
he carried equipment seven miles in dark to reach rebel village
he shot images of the fighting by hiding in rooms in their homes
he made it out of @entity10 riding on a truck , again in the dark , with fleeing refugees
