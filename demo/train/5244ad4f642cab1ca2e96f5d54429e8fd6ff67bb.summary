-- @entity2 's most brilliant document declares all men are created equal , however the same can not be said for all dresses			1
forty years ago , @entity5 created a superior , yet remarkably democratic , dress			1
though @entity7 was only in her 20s , an awkward time for many young women , she proved to have perfect timing when she unleashed her little dress onto the @entity2 fashion landscape			2
and little did she know that it , and she , would become the timeless icons of glamorous practicality they are today			0
the 1970s were a time when many women were entering the white - collar work force and also declaring their sexual independence			0
this was a radical combination of recognizing newfound professional power and redefining old sexual restrictions			0
@entity5 gave this new woman something new to wear for her new career and new sex life			1
the wrap literally dressed the movement			2
it liberated women from the stuffy and stiff male - imagined " working gal " get - ups ; it was easy to put on and take off ; it was smart , affordable and traveled well			0
the fabric was clingy but not cumbersome ; it celebrated a woman 's silhouette instead of trying to control it			2
the wrap dress would sway with a woman to her first big job , then seamlessly swing with her to her first hot date			1
@entity5 designed a dress for the new @entity2 woman on the move			1
rarely have we seen such a democratic design			2
the @entity5 wrap dress embraces diversity like no other before it or since			1
it can be worn well by women aged 20 to 70 and sizes 0 to 20			0
it comes in classic solids and a plethora of prints , can be layered with everything from denim jackets to floor - length furs			0
piles of jewels can fill the open front v - neckline or an elegant collarbone can be the sole accessory			0
the @entity5 wrap dress is often the symbol that one has gotten her first " real " job , yet it is equally appropriate if you occupy the corner office			1
as many women abandon early adult outfits , the wrap dress endures			1
most clothing designs are intended to date you , socioeconomically place you , locate and lock you in some position or lack thereof			0
but not this power piece , it has the flexibility to grow with you , as you become the fully self - determined , self - defined woman you want to be			0
a woman gets to fill the wrap with her possibility , and that 's its genius			1
the @entity5 wrap is the @entity92 dress			1
using herself as muse , @entity5 had a vision for who the @entity2 woman would become			2
she has been known to say she was n't sure what she wanted to do , but she knew the woman she wanted to become			0
and even before she became the @entity5 we know and revere , she gave that woman and millions of others something wonderful to wear			2
the classic sweater ballerinas wear in rehearsals , paired with a fluid skirt , @entity7 revealed , inspired the wrap dress			1
perhaps she foresaw herself and other @entity2 women making graceful global moves			0
aside from being a sharp businesswoman whose goods can be purchased in more than 55 countries , in 2006 she became president of the @entity114 ( the industry 's most influential organization )			2
in 2012 , @entity116 named her one of the 20 most powerful women in business			0
she has put herself in the center of several humanitarian and philanthropic efforts , including @entity122 , a campaign to eradicate the spread of @entity125 from mother to child by 2015			0
yet at the core of her busy ( at 67 , she says she 's never worked so hard ) multiplatform life is her focus on women			2
in a recent @entity133 interview , @entity7 stated : " everything i do now is for the empowerment of women			0
" and it is certain she has secured her legacy			0
like the @entity140 , a @entity5 dress has been housed in a prestigious institution in @entity142 , the @entity143			1
in 2009 , first lady @entity144 wore a chainlink - print wrap dress on the @entity148 ' first official @entity147 christmas card			1
the same year , former vogue contributing editor @entity149 curated the retrospective " @entity5 : journey of a dress , " which opened in @entity153			1
in 2010 , the show went to @entity155 , @entity156 , and in 2011 to the @entity157 in @entity158			0
it has since been re-imagined and expanded for its @entity2 debut at the historic @entity161 in @entity162			2
the show of dresses , photos and original art opened to the public on january 11 and will run through april 1 , 2014			1
the 40th birthday party of the dress that made the career that made the icon will go on year - round , with limited - edition collaborations with the @entity174 and a book , " the woman i wanted to be , " coming in the fall			0
with @entity2 facing the very real possibility of a woman winning the @entity147 in 2016 , @entity5 's 40 - year - old business model of investing in independent women , " celebrating freedom and selling confidence " appears to be more timely than ever .			1

@entity5 's iconic wrap dress was created 40 years ago
the " @entity189 " *exhibition* is on display in @entity162 until april 1
@entity191 : dress is democratic , as it accommodates almost any age or size
