-- what does a 22 - year - old see when she looks at herself in the mirror ? @entity4 sees a face marred by war , one that is jarring to others			1
even she ca n't stand to look sometimes			2
doctors reconstructed her jaw , removed scars and balanced her lips			2
in the coming days , she will get a new jaw implant , a bone graft and a set of upper teeth			2
" i see me , " she says , after pausing to think about how she might describe her reflection			2
" i look into my eyes and i know there is something there			2
" that something came from three harrowing years of captivity and the inner fortitude that fueled her desire to survive , so that she could live to tell about the ugliness she saw			2
one summer night in 2001 , @entity31 ( @entity31 ) guerrillas snatched @entity4 from a community center near her home in @entity35 district , @entity36			1
notorious for their cold - blooded cruelty , the @entity31 beat her , tortured her			1
she chooses not to discuss all the details but says this : if she did n't do what the @entity31 told her , she knew she would die			1
@entity4 's tale , sadly , is not uncommon			1
she is among thousands of children abducted by the @entity31			1
yet her pleas , and the pleas of all others who have tried to put an end to the abuse and killings committed by the @entity31 , have fallen largely on deaf years , she says			1
as she awaits her final round of surgery in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity4 is glad that the @entity31 - instigated conflict , the longest running in @entity55 , finally made headlines this year			1
she rejoiced in president @entity58 's decision last week to send 100 @entity60 military advisers to the @entity61 to help hunt down @entity31 leaders			1
and she rebuked conservative radio talk show host @entity63 , who lambasted @entity58 and defended the @entity31 as @entity65 aiming to remove dictatorship			1
" @entity31 are @entity65 , " @entity63 said			1
" they are fighting the @entity68 in @entity69			2
and @entity58 has sent troops , @entity60 troops , to remove them from the battlefield , which means kill them			1
" " dear mr. @entity63 , " @entity4 responded in a video message she sent to him			1
" my name is @entity4			1
i am a former abducted child			2
my heart breaks when i hear your message about the @entity31			1
" she had no mouth left @entity4 , an ethnic @entity79 , hailed from a poor family of nine children and grew up working on the farm with her parents			1
they grew corn , ground nut , cassava , sweet potatoes			2
she was a night commuter , as were many children in her district			2
every night , she traveled almost 10 miles just to sleep in the town center , where her parents felt she would be safer under near other public buildings and under the watch of the @entity36 army			2
in many cases , parents put their children in cages to protect them from the @entity31			1
the @entity31 sprouted as a rebel movement in the late 1980s among the @entity79 people in marginalized northern @entity36			1
but if there was a group ideology , little remains today			2
human rights groups say the @entity31 is known as a cult group that follows the self - proclaimed spiritual powers of its leader , @entity107 , who is wanted by the @entity108 for atrocities			1
for more than two decades , the @entity31 has targeted civilians and terrorized them in @entity36 and other neighboring nations			1
when the @entity31 's ruthless ways dwindled support from the acholi people , it began abducting children to carry on the fight			1
the group liked to kidnap boys and girls between the ages of nine and 12 -- strong enough to shoot a gun , small enough to squeeze through a window , young enough to have their moral compasses recalibrated to kill			2
@entity4 was one of them			1
" it is not uncommon for the girls who are abducted to be converted into sex slaves or forced into marriages with @entity31 fighters , " according to @entity131 , associate editor of the @entity132 and @entity133			1
" the boys who are snatched up have two choices , which are not really choices at all			2
either they fight to the death for @entity107 's apocalyptic worldview , or they can expect to be executed and dumped into a mass grave filled with their victims , " @entity131 wrote in a @entity0 article			2
or , sometimes , the girls are used as mules , says @entity145 , spokesman for the advocacy group @entity146			0
@entity4 recalled walking and walking			1
without food , without water			0
she was forced to carry things			0
the @entity31 stays alive by constantly moving , @entity145 said			1
through the thick , remote jungles of southern @entity69 , the @entity154 and the @entity61			0
there , people are poor and disconnected from the rest of the world			0
" the @entity31 are basically like sharks , " @entity145 says			1
" when people get too tired , they just kill them			0
" or in the very least , hurt them			0
the @entity31 soldiers beat @entity4			1
it was impossible to live among them and not be subjugated			0
sometimes @entity4 got caught in ambushes or firefights			1
she saw other children die around her			0
she had not even reached her teenage years and yet , there was no one around to hold her , soothe her , tell her things would be alright			2
more than a year passed like this for @entity4			1
one day , planes roared overhead -- the @entity36 and @entity154 armies often raided the @entity31			1
the winds were strong , the planes flew low			0
a bomb exploded behind her			2
her backpack , laden that day with heavy pots and pans , caught on fire			0
she felt a sharp pain in her foot			0
she took her shoe off and saw it was full of blood			0
she was carrying a child in her arms , desperate to find safe haven somewhere			0
and then she felt the blast of another bomb			1
@entity191 tore into her body , mangled her flesh , shattered all her teeth			0
in place of her face , there was a giant hole , like a crater in the ground			2
her clothes dripped with blood			0
she realized the child had died in her arms			0
she laid her down by her mother 's body			0
she did not want them to be separated			0
she remembers the guerrillas snapping pictures of her			0
they sent them to @entity107 to ascertain if she was worth saving			0
they were going to pull the trigger unless she could keep walking			0
and so she did , even with her horrific wounds			2
the @entity31 spared her life but refused her treatment			1
soon , infection set in			0
she could n't tell whether she would survive			0
she had no jaw or mouth left so she could n't eat or chew			0
instead , she lay down on the ground and poured liquid food into her mouth			0
she had only one set of clothes , constantly damp and smelly from the saliva that dribbled out			0
she knew she was a better , kinder person than the people around her who had inflicted such cruelty			0
she knew she had to escape			0
' hardly human ' one night in the fall of 2004 , apoko she said she was going to the bathroom but she never went back			0
she ran through the forest the darkness and did n't stop until she reached safety in @entity36			0
she was admitted to the @entity235 in northern @entity36 , which takes in child soldiers and helps them assimilate back into normal life			0
and she was able to see her family again			0
she first arrived for a series of surgeries in the @entity60 in 2005 with the help of @entity242 , a co-founder of the @entity243 , which seeks to help young survivors of trauma heal and begin life anew			1
in between her surgeries , she returned to @entity36 to endure more tragedy			0
her pregnant mother and the baby girl she was about to deliver died after they were poisoned			0
@entity4 arrived in @entity60 frightened and without speaking a word of @entity253			1
those who sheltered her here are amazed that she is the same woman who delivered a recorded message to @entity63 earlier this month			1
" the @entity31 is not @entity65 , " she told the talk show host			1
" @entity107 and his commanders could hardly be considered human			0
" in the video , @entity4 wore a necklace bearing the name of an abducted child , part of a campaign to raise money and awareness			1
that is her mission now -- to bring peace to children who have suffered			2
she even wants to try her hand at making a documentary film			0
and next month , she will appear in an episode of " @entity273 , " a series airing on @entity276 channel about women who have suffered facial injury			2
" enough children have died and too many have been displaced , " @entity4 said in her video			1
" every human being deserves peace in their life			0
we all deserve to live life without fear			0
" but all these years have gone by and efforts to quell @entity31 violence have not been successful			1
ironically , it was @entity63 's statements about the @entity31 that has cast attention on a neglected conflict , said @entity145 , the spokesman for @entity146			1
@entity4 is still waiting to hear back from @entity63			1
and waiting for the last round of surgery			0
the reflection in the mirror will perhaps be more pleasing to look at then			0
but she will always see " something there			0

the @entity31 abducted @entity4 when she was only 12
she was beaten , abused and suffered horrific injuries from a bomb blast
she escaped after three years and @entity60 doctors operated on her face
recently , she told @entity63 he was wrong to call the @entity31 @entity65
