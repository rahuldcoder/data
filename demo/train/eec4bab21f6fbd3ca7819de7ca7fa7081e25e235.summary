@entity0 -- a breakthrough in graphene research which could pave the way for new smaller , faster , more powerful computer chips has be made by @entity7 researchers			1
scientists at the @entity7 's @entity9 say they have demonstrated how graphene -- a two - dimensional material made from a single layer of carbon atoms -- could look inside electronic circuits of the future			1
graphene has been hailed as a " miracle material " which could revolutionize materials science because of its unique properties			1
measuring one atom thick , it it the thinnest material on @entity23 -- a stack of three million sheets would rise to the grand height of one millimeter			2
graphene is also the strongest ( 200 times stronger than steel ) , the most flexible and the most conductive material in the world -- which makes it an attractive alternative to the silicon chip			1
in their study , published in the journal @entity34 , researchers report how they created a four - layered structure consisting of two sheets of graphene sandwiched between two sheets of boron nitride -- a similar two - dimensional material with a thin hexagonal - like structure			1
" creating the multilayer structure has allowed us to isolate graphene from negative influence of the environment and control graphene 's electronic properties in a way it was impossible before , " @entity51 , lead author of the study			2
this " negative influence " relates to graphene 's ultra sensitivity to gases and humidity says @entity51 , which scientists at the university reported on back in 2007			1
" to make its properties more controllable , we have to protect it with something , " he said			0
the demonstration brings a replacement for the silicon chip one step closer , according to @entity51			0
they are reaching their limit for being scaled down , he says , and as computers get more powerful silicon is struggling to meet the increasing energy demands			0
the discovery of graphene was made at the university in 2004 by @entity77 physicists @entity78 and @entity79 , who received the @entity80 for physics for their work in 2010			1
commenting on the new research , @entity78 said : " @entity16 encapsulated within boron nitride offers the best and most advanced platform for future graphene electronics			1
it solves nasty issues about graphene 's stability and quality ... " it could be only a matter of several months before we have encapsulated graphene transistors with characteristics better than previously demonstrated , " he added			0
recent advances at @entity9 and other @entity7 universities has prompted the @entity7 government to invest Â £ 50 million ( $ 78 million ) in a research hub with the aim of maximizing the commercial potential of graphene			1
its not just computer circuit boards that graphene promises to transform			2
the discovery that it is extremely sensitive to single molecules of gas could , according to @entity78 and @entity79 , lead to the development of new sensors , with possible applications in counter-terrorism			0
" we are constantly looking at new ways of demonstrating and improving the remarkable properties of graphene , " @entity78 said			0
countless universities around the world are also engaged in the same task			0
the @entity121 's @entity120 in @entity122 , have recently discovered that graphene " exhibits a novel reaction to light , " which they say could improve night - vision systems and possibly provide a new approach to solar power			1
excitement is building in the consumer electronics market too , as phone and computer manufacturers look to capitalize on graphene 's uniqueness as a transparent conductor			2
" the vision is to have electronic devices which can be integrated with your body or clothing , or computers which can be bent or rolled up and put away , " said professor @entity135 , professor of nanotechnology at the @entity7 's @entity137			2
researchers at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 have already demonstrated a flexible touchscreen , he says			0
and rumors were rife in cyberspace recently that @entity147 electronics company , @entity151 were going to release a flexible smartphone , called the " @entity154 " in 2012			0
it turned out to be untrue , but bendable phones , computers and televisions may not be far off , says @entity159			0
" it may well be that in the next three or four years , if everything goes well , we may see some transparent and flexible devices made from graphene come to the market			0

new research at @entity7 university demonstrates how graphene - based computer chip might look
