-- early sunday , as the sun ascended to the winter sky , the very last @entity2 convoy made its way down the main highway that connects @entity7 and @entity8			1
the military called it its final " tactical road march			0
" a series of 110 heavily armored , hulking trucks and @entity15 vehicles carrying about 500 soldiers streamed slowly but steadily out of the combat zone			2
a few minutes before 8 a.m. , the metal gate behind the last @entity15 closed			0
with it came to an end a deadly and divisive war that lasted almost nine years , its enormous cost calculated in blood and billions			2
some rushed to touch the gate , forever a symbol now of an emotional , landmark day			0
some cheered with the @entity29 's ultimate expression of affirmation : " @entity31 ! " " it 's hard to put words to it right now , " said lt. col. @entity32			0
" it 's a feeling of elation , " he said , " to see what we 've accomplished in the last eight - and - a - half years and then to be part of the last movement out of @entity7			1
" once , when hundreds of thousands of @entity2 were in @entity7 , the main highway was better known as @entity43 and soldiers trekked north towards @entity45 and beyond , never knowing what danger lurked on their path			1
analysts : questions remain as @entity2 troops leave on this monumental day , the @entity53 - based 3rd @entity52 , 1st @entity55 's main concern was how to avoid a traffic jam on their final journey in @entity7			1
staff sgt. @entity58 , 37 , was on this road in august 2003			0
it was his first time at war			2
there was not a lot of traffic at that time , he recalled			0
he remembered a lot of cheering by @entity7 , even though the situation was tense			2
sunday morning , the air was decidedly different			0
" it 's pretty historic , " he said about the drive south , hoping he will not ever have to come back through this unforgiving terrain again			0
once there were bases sprinkled in the desolate desert between @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity2 soldiers hidden from view behind walls of giant mesh @entity81 bags filled with dirt and sand to stave off incoming fire			1
on this day , the roads , the bases were in @entity7 hands , the sands in the bags returned to the earth			2
once , almost nine years ago in march 2003 , @entity2 tanks and armored personnel carriers had thundered north , with the drive and determination needed to decapitate a dictator			1
timeline : key dates in the war on this day , heading south towards @entity101 border crossing , the soldiers took stock of their sacrifice			1
in another war , there had been little joy or even emotion as final jet transports lifted @entity2 from @entity110 soil			1
sunday saw the end of the largest troop drawdown for the @entity2 since @entity113			1
those men and women who fought in @entity7 may not feel they are leaving behind an unfinished war or returning home to a nation as deeply scarred as it was after years of @entity113			1
but many crossed the border harboring mixed feelings and doubt about the future of @entity7			1
" the biggest thing about going home is just that it 's home , " @entity58 said			0
" it 's civilization as i know it -- the western world , not sand and dust and the occasional rain here and there			0
" a month ago , @entity135 , the last @entity2 base before the five - hour drive to the @entity8 border , housed 12,000 people			1
by thursday , the day the @entity2 formally ended its mission in @entity7 with a flag - casing ceremony in @entity45 , under 1,000 people remained there			1
the @entity143 , @entity144 officially transferred control of @entity146 to the @entity7 on friday , though it did not really change hands until the last @entity2 departed early sunday morning			1
group seeks to help returning vets find jobs at its height , @entity135 housed thousands of troops and had a large @entity154 , fast - food outlets , coffee shops and even an @entity158 restaurant			0
now a ghost town , the @entity2 gave 110,000 items left at adder to the @entity7 , a loot worth $ 76 million , according to the military			1
in her last days working in a guard tower in @entity7 , sgt. @entity164 , 29 , dreamed of seeing her three children and eating crispy chicken tacos at @entity170 's @entity169 restaurant in @entity171 , @entity53			2
she also looked forward to not having to carry her gun with her to the bathroom			0
@entity164 , a combat medic , spent her first tour of @entity7 with her husband , also a soldier			2
" when @entity177 was captured and killed , my mom was like ' does that mean that everybody is coming home now ? ' " @entity164 said			0
" we actually had it a lot better than the people did who did the initial invasion , " she said			0
" we 're just thankful that we 're not getting attacked every day			0
" when the war was at its worst in 2006 , @entity2 had 239,000 men and women in uniform stationed in more than 500 bases sprinkled throughout @entity7			1
another 135,000 contractors were working in @entity7			2
the @entity2 will still maintain a presence in @entity7 : hundreds of nonmilitary personnel , including 1,700 diplomats , law enforcement officers , and economic , agricultural and other experts , according to the @entity199			1
in addition , 5,000 security contractors will protect @entity2 and another 4,500 contractors will serve in other roles			2
the quiet @entity2 exit , shrouded in secrecy until it occurred , closes a war that was contentious from the start and cost the nation more than $ 800 billion			1
president @entity209 , who had made a campaign promise to bring home @entity2 troops , reflected on a greater cost as sunday 's exit made good on his word			1
according to the defense department , 4,487 service members were killed in the war			0
more than 30,000 were wounded			0
in all , 1.5 million @entity2 served their nation at war			1
" all of them -- our troops , veterans , and their families -- will always have the thanks of a grateful nation , " @entity209 said in his weekly radio address saturday			0
it 's impossible to know with certainty the number of @entity7 who have died in @entity7 since 2003			2
but the independent public database @entity233 has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and october 2010 , with four out of five dead being civilians			0
and the question of how @entity7 will fare in the months ahead , without @entity2 troops , is also impossible to answer			1
even before the last soldiers had left , political crisis was erupting in @entity45			1
the powerful political bloc @entity241 said it was suspending its participation in parliament , which would threaten @entity7 's fragile power - sharing arrangement			2
@entity241 accuses @entity7 prime minister @entity245 of amassing power			2
the withdrawal of @entity2 troops stirred conflicting emotions on the streets of @entity45			1
in the predominately @entity252 neighborhood of @entity253 , where @entity254 made his final public appearance in 2003 , a man said residents were afraid , tense and worried about @entity258 's influence			0
he refused to appear on camera or give his name because of what he said was the sensitive nature of the situation			0
in a @entity266 neighborhood on the other side of the city , one man said he supported the toppling of @entity254 's regime , but felt too much blood was shed afterward			0
" the @entity2 went through and they ruined this country , ( bringing ) with them many troubles			2
and now they 're going , and ... more trouble 's coming , " said the man , who asked to be called @entity275 for security reasons			0
but for the last @entity2 troops out , the message was clear col. @entity281 , their commander , spent the past few weeks speaking to the soldiers in each of his companies			1
he told them he was proud of his troops and they should be proud of what they had accomplished			0
and , he wanted his soldiers to take care of themselves back home as much as they did in @entity7			1
in the months before the brigade deployed in february , it lost 13 soldiers to accidents , some because of driving under the influence of alcohol			0
at least one death was a suicide			0
" quite frankly we lost more soldiers in peacetime in the nine or 10 months before this brigade deployed due to accidents and risky behavior ... than we lost here in combat , " @entity281 said			0
" we want every soldier that survived this combat deployment to survive redeployment and reintegration			0
" capt. @entity313 , 28 , said he was worried about the well - being of his soldiers , many of whom have done multiple tours of @entity7 and felt the stress and sting of war			1
was the loss , the grief , worth it ? for @entity313 , it will all depend on how @entity7 's future unfolds -- whether democracy and human rights will take root , whether @entity7 will be a steadfast @entity2 ally			1
it will depend , he said , on how @entity7 shapes its own destiny			2
@entity0 's @entity331 reported from the @entity7 - @entity8 border , @entity333 and @entity334 from @entity45 and @entity335 from @entity336 .			1
