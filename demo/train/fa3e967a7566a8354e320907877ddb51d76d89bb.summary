-- there 's a sad irony in the fact that one of the great tests of @entity7 's freedom of speech should involve a movie that , according to some reviewers , utterly sucks			1
@entity10 calls " @entity11 " an " alleged satire that 's about as funny as a communist food shortage , and just as protracted			0
" yet this " comedy " about two tv guys tasked with assassinating @entity19 dictator @entity18 has sparked a cyberterror campaign that amounts to extortion			1
what is being threatened ? well , it started with the leaking of @entity24 emails by online hackers , which has caused tremendous embarrassment to the company and a little humor for the rest of us			0
but now hackers claiming to be the " @entity32 " -- the group that said it was behind the @entity24 hack -- seem to have quashed not only the @entity35 premier planned for thursday , but caused @entity24 today to announce that it would cancel the film 's december 25 theatrical release			1
the hackers had threatened the lives of cinema - goers and those within the vicinity of theaters , and actively invoked memories of 9/11			1
is this assault on artistic license coming directly from the @entity19 regime ? we do n't know			2
but it should never be forgotten that @entity19 has financed terrorism in the past , including the bombing of passenger jets			2
why would they take such offense at " @entity55 " ? probably because it goes directly after the image of @entity18			2
@entity19 is n't your typical atheist communist dictatorship			2
it 's far more like the religious - nationalist regime of @entity62 during the @entity63 , in which the leader is elevated to the status of a living god			0
put it all together and it 's understandable why theaters chose to take the hackers seriously and pull the movie			1
of course , it would be nice if they could take a stand for freedom of speech , but they have a wider responsibility to the physical safety of the public			0
the tragedy is that all this fuss is n't about something approaching a serious work of art. but aside from being trashily commercial , modern @entity85 also has a bit of a blind spot when it comes to making movies about bad people overseas			0
we often see evidence of greedy capitalists on @entity94 , or nasty homegrown @entity95 attacking gays and lesbians			0
but serious films about the shocking homophobia of the @entity101 continent , anti-religious persecution in @entity103 or the obvious evil of @entity19 are strangely few and far between			1
this may well be because the marketing people calculate that something so depressing wo n't exactly be box office gold			0
thus totalitarianism crops up in @entity7 cinema either as fantasy ( the @entity112 in " @entity113 " ) or as something to laugh at ( " @entity115 " also tackled @entity19 , albeit with genuine wit )			1
proof positive of the essentially cowardly nature of @entity85 is that executives reportedly screened the ending of " @entity11 " for the @entity121 -- and won official blessing			1
perhaps this cyberterrorism will convince @entity85 that there are wicked people beyond their shores and that it is worth making far more intelligent movies about them -- movies that go beyond cartoon stereotypes of @entity132 and @entity133 and deal with the realities of authoritarianism			1
until then , there are so many questions about the consequences of the recent threats : what happens if someone advertises a private screening of " @entity11 " ? if @entity145 decides to make it available for home users , what would the terrorists threaten to do ? if the threats are the offspring of the regime 's fetid imagination , perhaps it reveals something about their limited understanding of how the modern world works			2
in the age of the @entity158 , you ca n't easily censor a movie or withdraw it from the public domain			0
and do they really expect @entity7 / @entity19 relations to hinge on the willingness of @entity164 to try ? there is something depressingly farcical about this whole story			0
hopefully , it wo n't turn violent .			0

@entity170 : ironic that test of free speech centers around *lousy* movie " @entity55 "
he says hackers that may be linked to @entity19 threaten lives of *moviegoers* -- it 's extortion
he says it makes sense that theaters chose to pull movie for *patrons* ' safety
@entity170 : *incident* points up that @entity85 should make serious films about totalitarianism
