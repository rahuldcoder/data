-- do you belieb that one of @entity4 's biggest exports could be deported as a result of his recent @entity7 arrest ? the possibility is slim			0
nevertheless , less than a week after it was first posted to the government 's " @entity10 " platform , over 100,000 @entity12 have signed a petition asking the @entity15 administration to revoke @entity17 's green card			1
( why ? because " he is not only threatening the safety of our people but he is also a terrible influence on our nations youth			0
" ) and according to the site 's terms of participation , this means that the @entity19 must now respond to the petition " in a timely fashion			1
" just do n't expect that response to come soon â € ” or to affirm that @entity17 really will be kicked off our amber waves of grain			2
@entity35 pop culture petitions are n't exactly a top priority for the @entity19 ; in the past , they 've taken two months to respond to calls for the construction of a @entity39 ( " the administration does not support blowing up planets " ) and the cancellation of @entity41 following an offensive segment ( " @entity45 of the @entity46 protects free speech , even if individuals might personally find it offensive or distasteful " )			2
and perhaps more importantly , duis and drag - racing are n't deportable offenses			0
as the @entity53 points out , immigration visas can only be revoked in the event of a violent crime or a prison sentence that exceeds one year ; @entity17 faces an array of potential consequences , but if he is sentenced to prison , he 'd only get up to six months for drag racing and up to six months for the @entity61			2
@entity17 's arraignment is scheduled for feb. 14			1
in the meantime , he 'll be kept busy with his @entity65 egging charges and , perhaps , the sale of his @entity68 mansion			0
oh , and maybe making music as well â € ” his next music video debuts on @entity71 today at 7 p.m. et. see the original story at @entity0			1
