-- one of the diplomatic cables published by @entity2 reveals that @entity4 officials suggested the @entity6 government make arrangements for rock icon @entity8 to perform in @entity9 as a way of building " good will " between the countries			1
the suggestion was relayed to the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , through an intermediary whose name was redacted from the document			1
" arranging an @entity8 concert in @entity9 could also be useful , [ the intermediary ] said , given @entity25 's second son 's devotion to the rock legend , " the cable begins			1
" as @entity25 's second son , @entity28 , is reported to be a great fan , the performance could be an opportunity to build good will			1
" representatives for @entity8 did not immediately respond to requests for comment on sunday			2
but one analyst cautioned sunday that the 2007 cable 's contents could say more about an intermediary 's interest in trying to promote himself by arranging a high - profile performance than @entity4 's leadership			1
" at that point , given the generally positive diplomatic atmosphere , i doubt the @entity6 government would have objected			2
but this may be more the fantasy of a self - promoting intermediary than a reflection of the desire of the @entity25 and his sons to rock ' n ' roll in @entity9 , " said @entity44 , author of " meltdown : the @entity53 of the @entity54			1
" however , @entity44 -- formerly @entity0 's senior asia correspondent -- noted that the cable is not the first time a story has surfaced about the @entity25 family 's admiration for the @entity61 rock legend			1
" one of the stories about @entity28 and his brother @entity64 is that one , or both , supposedly went to a @entity8 concert somewhere in @entity68 while they were attending boarding school in @entity70 , " he said			2
the cable , titled " [ redacted ] @entity72 on @entity73 , " deals with @entity4 relations with @entity16 , the @entity6 , and korean - americans wishing to meet with their relatives still in the country			1
it makes no reference to the @entity4 nuclear program			0
the intermediary advocated for greater @entity6 government involvement in " facilitating the reunification of @entity86 families divided by the @entity87			2
" the cable mentions two groups -- compatriots @entity91 and the @entity93 - based @entity92 -- that arrange such reunions but often have difficulties dealing with the @entity4 bureaucracy			0
the document says compatriots @entity91 has arranged " thousands of reunions , " but it is under the control of @entity4 's @entity102			2
that committee , the cable claims , " extorts a tremendous amount of money from desperate families to arrange the visits			0
" according to the cable , the intermediary told @entity6 diplomats that " @entity4 would not run such an exploitative system if the @entity6 government were involved in the process			1
there is a reluctance , he said , for @entity4 - @entity6 to pursue family reunions because they do not want to divulge their personal information to the @entity73 and they do not want the @entity4 to milk them for money before , during and after the reunion			0
" " the [ @entity6 government ] could at least volunteer to serve as a conduit for correspondence between these families and @entity4 to prevent the @entity73 from learning the home addresses and bank accounts of participants			0
the @entity73 might be willing to accept this structure because it badly wants a relationship with @entity131 , " the cable reads			0
the intermediary also described the frustrating process for any outsiders to get things done in @entity4			0
" it is necessary to get the @entity73 's various institutions to cooperate			0
each institution seems to have veto power , but none has the power to push anything forward			0
... the only organizations that can really deliver are the military , which does not talk to anybody , or the @entity145			0
