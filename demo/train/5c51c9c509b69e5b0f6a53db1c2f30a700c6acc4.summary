-- try writing a post seeking comment on whether embattled @entity4 star @entity3 could ultimately be forgiven and watch your social network streams light up with a fair amount of outrage questioning how you could even suggest such a thing			1
it is definitely not politically correct to ask if a man seen on a hotel surveillance video knocking out his then - @entity16 © e and dragging her from an elevator could one day face redemption			1
but many other superstar athletes -- from @entity20 , who was convicted of bankrolling a dog fighting ring , to @entity22 , who was divorced by his wife after several allegations of infidelity -- were forgiven by fans and the public			1
could -- or should -- the same thing happen with @entity3 , a 27 - year - old running back recently released by the @entity30 ? there are signs some are already giving @entity3 a second chance			1
in his first public appearance since being suspended indefinitely by the @entity4 -- a suspension the @entity4 players ' union appealed on his behalf -- he attended a football game saturday at his high school alma mater in his hometown of @entity42 , @entity43			1
@entity44 , now his wife , was by his side , and his 2 - year - old daughter sat on his shoulders for some of the game			2
" @entity3 is a part of our family and a part of this program , and that 's why i 'm very happy that he 's here today , " said the team 's coach , @entity51 , according to @entity53			1
" he made a mistake -- and he made a very terrible mistake -- but i know the character of the man , and he will rise from this			2
" at the @entity30 ' first game of the season , several fans , including women , wore @entity3 's no. 27 jersey			1
one , @entity69 , told @entity0 's @entity70 on " @entity71 , " " he is human and people make mistakes			1
" what it will take for the larger public to agree with that sentiment and forgive @entity3 comes down to two questions , according to @entity79 , a human behavior expert			1
" one ( is ) how much do we actually like the person already ? the second is what did we just see ? if we see the results of the beating , we react more harshly , " @entity79 said			0
for instance , he points to the condemnation of singer @entity89 after the photo of @entity92 's bloody face surfaced			2
@entity69 ultimately pleaded guilty in june 2009 to assaulting his then - girlfriend on the eve of the @entity95			2
" when we see the bruises , the cuts , the bleeding , the scars , we feel a lot more pain , therefore we respond with a lot more anger , " @entity79 said			0
" we have anger that says this situation needs resolving			0
" besides the brutality of the video that has now been seen by millions , @entity3 faces other challenges should he ultimately seek forgiveness , domestic violence experts and women and men around the country said : answering the questions of whether a man who hit his partner and knocked her out will do it again and whether he can ultimately change			1
@entity118 , president and chief executive officer of the @entity120 , said a man who hits his wife can stop if there is " an honest willingness to change and diligence applied to the process of changing			0
" that means taking full responsibility for his actions and seeking help , said @entity132			0
if @entity3 does that , he could be given a second chance , she said			2
" abusers deserve to be forgiven , especially if they make changes in their life that allows them to live a life free from continuing to be verbally , physically and / or sexually abusive , " said @entity132			0
" we at the hotline would n't be doing what we do if we did n't feel that people can make change			2
however , change is difficult			0
" @entity146 , a mom of four from @entity147 , @entity148 , said forgiveness on the part of the public could be possible for @entity3 but not just because time passes or he apologizes			1
" forgiveness comes when a person shows genuine remorse over and over , tries to do better over and over , " she said on @entity153			0
" it is trying to live right because that is right , not because one gains something in return			0
" @entity162 , a retired elementary school principal in @entity163 , @entity164 , said forgiving does not mean condoning @entity3 's actions			1
" @entity3 was wrong , needs consequences , counseling and ultimately forgiveness			1
he needs deep counseling , not talking heads on tv			0
" for others , the fact that @entity3 's wife , @entity173 , has forgiven him means the public can and should forgive him , too			1
" i personally think what he did is despicable , " said @entity176 of @entity43			0
" however , we are not his spouse			0
so ultimately if his wife has shown grace to forgive him ... all we can do is support him			2
we all have done things in our past that we realize are wrong			0
the goal is to change and influence others to amend their behavior			0
" @entity188 , a self - described " huge @entity30 fan " from @entity189 who admits it 's hard to be objective , said she believes @entity3 may be a scapegoat for other problems affecting the @entity4			1
" what @entity3 did was horrific , but he is now paying a penalty , not for his actions but for the @entity4 being embarrassed by not having punished him appropriately in the first place , " she said			1
" everyone deserves a second chance			0
he has done so much good in our community and is doing all the things that have been asked of him legally and by the league in retribution			0
" but others said they believe @entity3 's actions can never be forgiven			1
" from what i 've heard and read , i would n't forgive him , " said a woman on @entity211 's facebook page			2
" he hit his wife ! i just do n't find him a man worthy of my respect			0
better yet , any man who lays a hand on a woman is not worthy of respect			0
" what do you think ? do you think @entity3 can or should be forgiven ? tell @entity223 on @entity224 or @entity211 on @entity153 .			2

@entity4 players ' union has appealed @entity3 's indefinite suspension from the @entity4
many fans , including women , wore @entity3 's number at the @entity30 ' season opener
@entity3 's *likability* is a factor in whether the public will ultimately forgive him , expert says
another factor , experts say , is the impact of what people saw @entity3 do in surveillance video
