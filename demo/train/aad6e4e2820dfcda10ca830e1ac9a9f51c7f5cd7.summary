-- it 's the story which just refuses to go away -- and now a new @entity3 " whistle - blower " has claimed bribes were offered in exchange for votes during the @entity7 2018 and 2022 bidding process			1
a former member of @entity3 's ethics committee , @entity11 , says a member of the world governing body 's executive committee asked a member of the @entity18 bid team for the @entity19 for a kickback in exchange for a vote			1
" i know of one particular instance where one of the @entity26 bid team was asked for cash money by one of the executive committee members , " @entity11 told @entity0			2
" i then reported that to the chairman of the investigative chamber of the executive committee , @entity33 , so even i have this evidence			0
" the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments has been the subject of an independent @entity3 investigation by @entity39 lawyer @entity33 following allegations of corruption			1
@entity33 's report led to two female " whistle - blowers " being identified , with @entity11 now the third individual to come forward and identify problems with the bidding process			1
but the @entity39 lawyer 's report has become mired in controversy after @entity51 judge @entity50 -- @entity3 's independent ethics adjudicator -- published a summary of the evidence the @entity39 had collated			1
@entity3 's hopes of drawing a line over the @entity7 bidding saga almost immediately evaporated when @entity33 said the 42 - page summary contained " numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations			1
" @entity11 , who also works with @entity18 broadcaster @entity60 , went on : " i was on the @entity3 ethics committee at the time			1
the @entity3 ethics committee was not dealing with the bid process at that time			1
" but once @entity33 began his investigation into the 2018 and 2022 @entity65 , i reported this to @entity33 , as was my duty			2
" while @entity11 refused to name the person who is alleged to have asked for a financial incentive and whether they are a current @entity3 executive committee member , he says he was not surprised by the incident			1
" a very high level official , a trusted , reliable person who i know reported this to me			0
this person is a member of the @entity18 bid team , " said the 69 - year - old @entity11 , who is known as @entity26 's ' mr. @entity76			1
" matters related to the 2018/2022 enquiry are solely handled by the investigatory chamber of the independent @entity82 and as such we are not in position to make any comments , " said @entity3 in a statement			2
" but we have passed on your enquiry to the @entity82 accordingly			0
" in september @entity33 said for the first time that his report should be made public with redactions , though @entity3 has always maintained it should remain private over confidentiality issues			2
" so that 's an impasse that should be sorted , " said @entity11 , who was a member of the @entity82 between 2003 and 2013 , and as of july 2012 a member of the @entity93 , according to @entity3 , before he left the organization just over a year aog			1
" in my opinion it should be published , of course , " added the @entity18			0
" if there is going to be transparency you can not keep things from the public and @entity3 has to publish these things in the end			0
" however @entity11 's intervention came as a surprise to one former member of the @entity18 bid team			1
" the idea of @entity11 being a ' whistle - blower ' is interesting , but not one that 's weighed down by evidence , " @entity110 , former head of corporate affairs for the bid team , told @entity0			1
" it 's time to stop hiding behind this culture of silence and the quaint concept of confidentiality that pervades @entity3 , " she added			2
" @entity11 says he is ' perfectly free to talk about this ' , yet he is coy when asked who it is			0
fans are entitled to know			0
" if @entity11 refused to name names surrounding the allegations of bribery , he was more forthcoming in his views on @entity131 winning the right to host the @entity19			2
the @entity133 has repeatedly denied allegations that it bought votes and was cleared of any wrongdoing in the 42 - page summary released by @entity50			0
" the only possible explanation for @entity131 winning that @entity7 bid , in my view , is because there was some funny business going on , and with that being the case and there being no other explanation , this story is not going to go away , " said @entity11			1
@entity11 also believes that @entity3 made a " big mistake " by allowing the @entity7 to go to @entity131 citing the nation 's human rights records as one area of concern			1
" i think @entity3 made a big mistake in awarding @entity131 the @entity7 for many reasons , " he said			1
" among them is that it 's probably among the most morally corrupt regimes in the world , it treats its migrant workers like slaves , it has draconian medieval laws that are not in keeping with modern civilization			1
" its human rights record does n't make the country fit to be a host of the @entity167 's greatest sporting event			0
" i am hoping @entity3 will be much more careful who it awards the @entity7 hosting rights to , or at least it tries to compel a future host of the @entity7 to clean up its act in the area of human rights before the tournament can actually take place in that country			2
" last month , @entity131 was back in the headlines after winning the right to host the 2019 @entity180			0
that decision was also met with criticism by human rights groups who are unhappy at the @entity133 's treatment of migrant workers			0
in a statement , the @entity187 insisted the country is making progress and expects labor reforms to be implemented over the coming months			0
" a new sponsorship law , currently under review , that will replace the outdated " kafala " system will be announced by next year , " said the statement			0
" @entity201 " is an employment sponsorship system that regulates the relationship between employers and migrant workers in several @entity200			0
" we are also working on laws to cover domestic workers , " the statement added			0
" as in every country in the world , change does not happen overnight			0
significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish , but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in @entity131			0
" our plans are going through a legislative process and we expect to make announcements about new legislation by early next year			0
