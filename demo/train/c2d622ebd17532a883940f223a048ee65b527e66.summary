-- referee @entity1 has no case to answer in relation to a complaint from @entity5 that he used racist language towards one of their players during a @entity11 game			1
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) announced thursday that their probe into the incident found @entity1 did not say " shut up you monkey " to midfielder @entity21 , as had been claimed by another of their players , @entity18			1
and while the official has been completely exonerated , the @entity12 insisted that @entity5 and @entity18 , who is the only player to have heard the alleged comment , were right to report the matter			1
the @entity12 also confirmed @entity21 has been charged for his conduct after the game against @entity28 on october 28 when he went into the officials ' changing room to confront @entity31			1
the referee , who has not taken charge of a game since the incident , said in a statement he hoped " no referee has to go through this in the future			0
" a statement on the @entity12 's website read : " having considered all of the available evidence it was the opinion of @entity44 , independent counsel , that the evidence of @entity18 was not supported by any other evidence			1
" moreover it was contradicted by other witnesses and does not cross the evidential threshold required to bring a charge against @entity1			0
" having considered @entity52 's opinion , and in view of all the circumstances of the case , the @entity12 does not believe that there is a case for mr @entity1 to answer			1
" equally the @entity12 is satisfied that the allegation against @entity1 by @entity18 was made in good faith			1
it is entirely possible for a witness to be genuinely mistaken and convincing in his belief			0
" the head of the @entity64 , who organize @entity12 's referees , said they would be recording all communication between the referee and players in future			2
@entity1 added in a statement : " to know you were innocent of something but that there was the opportunity for it to wreck your career was truly frightening			0
" racism has no place in football and this experience should not discourage those to speak out if they genuinely believe they are a victim of abuse			0
" however , there are processes that should be adhered in order that any investigation can be carried out in a manner that is fair for all parties involved			0
" i know first - hand the ramifications of allegations of this nature being placed into the public domain ahead of a formal process and investigation			0
" @entity5 defended their position in a statement released on their official website			0
" with regards to the @entity1 decision , the club accepts the case is now concluded and notes the @entity12 states the allegation was made in good faith , " it read			1
" @entity5 has a duty of care , as do all employers , to act responsibly when such allegations are reported by employees			2
" we did not take the decision to lodge a formal complaint with the @entity12 lightly and followed the correct procedures and protocols throughout			0
" @entity5 confirmed that @entity21 would accept the charge against him , but would request a personal hearing			2
the @entity31 decision came as interim manager @entity120 took charge of @entity5 training for the first time after the sacking wednesday of @entity125			2
the 3 - 2 defeat to @entity28 , which saw @entity127 controversially sent off by @entity1 , was the start of a poor run which ultimately cost @entity125 his job with the @entity132 champions .			2
