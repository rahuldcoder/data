-- the @entity1 recently issued a warning to doctors about prescribing medications with more than 325 milligrams of acetaminophen			1
although acetaminophen is harmless in small doses , it can cause liver damage if taken incorrectly			2
here are five things you should know about this popular painkiller : 1			0
it 's not great for muscle pain			1
acetaminophen is part of a class of painkillers called non-opioid analgesics , which are used to treat mild or moderate pain			1
these include acetaminophen , ibuprofen and aspirin			2
non-opiod analgesics block an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase , or @entity28 , according to @entity29 , an assistant professor of anesthesiology at @entity31			0
@entity28 helps the body produce lipid compounds called prostaglandins that cause pain and inflammation when your cells are injured			2
blocking this enzyme , therefore , helps prevent prostaglandins from causing you pain			2
most non-opiod analgesics work in the peripheral nervous system , or the nerves not included in your brain and spinal cord			0
but scientists believe acetaminophen works primarily in the central nervous system , attacking a slightly different form of the enzyme called @entity28			2
" what this means to you is that acetaminophen is great for headaches , fever and minor aches and pains but wo n't reduce inflammation due to , say , a muscle sprain , " @entity29 explained			2
it 's found in more than @entity62			1
though many people know that acetaminophen in the active ingredient in @entity62 , it 's also found in many other over-the - counter drugs including ( but not limited to ) some @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 products			1
acetaminophen is also used in combination with opioids in prescription pain medications such as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity62 with codeine			1
to find out whether your medications contain acetaminophen , read the drug label or the list of ingredients in the patient information leaflet that came with your prescription			1
look for the word " acetaminophen " or the letters " @entity90 , " an abbreviation sometimes used for the drug			1
if you are still unsure , contact your doctor or pharmacist			0
it 's easy to accidentally take too much			2
the @entity1 has set the recommended daily maximum for adults at 4,000 milligrams			1
it 's easier to reach this limit than you might think ; one gel tablet of @entity62 , for example , contains 500 mg. taking too much acetaminophen can lead to liver failure or death			1
overdoses of the popular painkiller are some of the most common poisonings worldwide , according to the @entity110			0
in april 2009 , the @entity1 introduced new labeling requirements for drug manufacturers			1
any product that contains acetaminophen must prominently identify the active ingredient on its display panel and must warn consumers about the potential for liver toxicity			1
consumers should not take more than the prescribed dose of any medication that contains acetaminophen , according to the @entity1 , and should avoid taking more than one acetaminophen product at a time			1
it 's not the best way to fight a hangover			2
most of us have popped a couple of painkillers after a night out to ward off a hangover			0
but experts say you should choose carefully when opening the medicine cabinet , especially if you 're a chronic heavy drinker			0
taking acetaminophen with alcohol , even in small amounts , can increase your risk of liver damage and / or kidney disease			0
acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver , where it is turned into nontoxic compounds that are eliminated through urination			0
but the liver needs something called glutathione to do that			0
if your glutathione levels are low -- which can be caused by chronic drinking , an unhealthy diet or fasting -- the drug may be metabolized into a more toxic substance , according to the @entity110			0
liver damage may occur after taking as few as four or five extra-strength pills over the course of the day , one @entity110 publication on alcohol and metabolism says			0
and another study showed that taking the recommended dose of acetaminophen with a small to moderate amount of alcohol can increase your risk of kidney disease by 123 %			1
you may not notice the signs of liver damage right away , the @entity1 says ; some symptoms like loss of appetite and nausea can be mistaken for the flu ( or that hangover )			1
if you suspect you 're at risk , contact your doctor immediately			0
it 's not like " a spoonful of sugar			0
" children can take acetaminophen to fight pain or a fever , but parents should read drug labels carefully to avoid dosage errors			1
the " directions " section of the label tells you whether the medicine is right for your child and how much to give , the @entity110 's website says ( @entity196 )			0
" if a dose for your child 's weight or age is not listed on the label or you ca n't tell how much to give , ask your pharmacist or doctor what to do			2
" liquid acetaminophen for infants and children is now sold in the same concentration : 160 mg / 5 ml. that means infants need less ; acetaminophen products for infants are usually packaged with an oral syringe instead of a dropper			0
parents should always use the measuring tool that comes with the medication , the @entity1 says -- never a kitchen spoon			1
if your child takes too much acetaminophen , seek medical attention right away			0
you can also call the 24 - hour @entity223 at 800 - 222 - 1222 .			0
