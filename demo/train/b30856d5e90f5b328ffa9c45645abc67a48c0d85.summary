@entity0 -- she 's traveled more than 35,000 kilometers hugging the equator , powered entirely by the sun. @entity5 , the world 's largest solar powered boat , recently stopped off in @entity0 's @entity8 as part of its 18 - month journey around the world			1
measuring 31 meters ( 102 feet ) long and 15 meters ( 49 feet ) wide , the catamaran is powered by 537 - square meters of photovoltaic solar panels			1
on a sunny day they produce on average 94 kilowatts of power -- the equivalent to 127 horsepower			1
seventy - five percent of the energy propels the boat that travels between 5 and 10 knots an hour			1
the remainder is used for everything else from flushing toilets to operating the boat 's navigational systems			2
@entity5 is the brainchild of 39 - year - old @entity26 @entity25			1
while hiking in @entity28 , the former ambulance driver was alarmed to see how quickly the glaciers were melting and decided to find a novel way to raise awareness of global warming			0
" if we can go out on the road with this boat , it 's a huge boat , only on solar energy , and we live on this boat , everything is working the computer , the telephone , everything is on solar energy			1
it means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday , " @entity25 said			2
built in @entity48 at the cost of $ 26 million dollars , this vessel tracks the sun thanks to state - of - the - art solar technology			2
" we can travel around three days with no light , " explains @entity52 , chief engineer aboard the boat			2
" but usually there is light everyday even if it 's raining			0
so when we come in a bad weather situation we can expand this time , we reduce this speed and we sail for about 5 days before we run out of battery , " he added			0
@entity5 set sail from @entity63 in september 2010 crossing the @entity64 , the @entity65 and is currently in the @entity66			2
it will then travel across the @entity70 and the @entity71 before finally returning to the @entity72 where it plans to dock back in @entity63 in may next year			0
@entity75 captain , @entity76 ( one of six crew members on board ) , says that while the technology has been faultless , @entity80 has proven to be a challenge			0
" when you cross to the south of the planet you always find rain , strong winds and big waves , so we passed all this with lots of patience and humility , because you are always humble against bad weather , " @entity83 explains			0
in every port , the catamaran and its message has been warmly received			0
it 's hoped the shipping industry -- responsible for 5 % of global greenhouse gas emissions , according to the @entity102 -- embraces this technology the same way the public has			1
" one day we wo n't have any more oil anywhere			0
maybe it 's in 50,100 , 200 years but one day we will have no more oil and we 'll have to find another way to live , " @entity25 said			0
and if @entity5 completes its mission , the crew says that will be proof that the sun , and solar power , is the answer .			1

@entity5 , the world 's largest solar - powered boat stops off in @entity0 to promote green energy
solar *yacht* has 537 - square meters of photovoltaic cells which can produce 94 kilowatts of power
captain of @entity5 hopes shipping industry will embrace solar energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
