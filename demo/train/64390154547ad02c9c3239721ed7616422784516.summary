-- sponsors of the @entity3 ballot measure that banned same - sex marriage are seeking to nullify thousands of marriages between gay and lesbian couples performed after the state @entity8 ruled them constitutional			1
the passge of @entity11 left the future of thousands of marriages between same - sex couples unclear			1
the sponsors friday filed responses to three @entity18 8 lawsuits with the state @entity8			1
the briefs also defend @entity11 against opponents ' legal challenges , including an argument that the amendment needed a constitutional convention to be added to the state 's constitution			1
" we are confident that the will of the voters and proposition 8 will ultimately be upheld , " said @entity28 , general counsel for @entity28 and the @entity30			2
@entity3 attorney general @entity34 called on the court to reject the initiative			2
" proposition 8 must be invalidated because the amendment process can not be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification , " @entity34 said in a written statement			2
@entity42 , founder and chair of the @entity44 , said he was " appalled " that the initiative 's supporters wanted to nullify the same - sex marriages that are already on the books			1
" the motivation behind this mean - spirited and heart - breaking action should not be allowed to be buried in legal brief , " he said			1
" if proposition 8 's sponsors plan to destroy lives , they should at least have the courage to admit it publicly			1
" opponents filed suit quickly after the november 4 election in which @entity11 passed 52 percent to 48 percent , effectively reversing a @entity3 @entity8 decision that it was unconstitutional to deny marriage licenses to same - sex couples			1
the vote also prompted a series of protests , some aimed at supporters of the proposition			0
the proposition , which added an amendment to the state constitution , defined marriage as between one man and one woman			0
opponents argue that the amendment can not be applied retroactively , but proponents say the amendment is clear on that issue			0
" @entity11 's brevity is matched by its clarity , " one of the briefs read			2
" there are no conditional clauses , exceptions , exemptions , or exclusions : ' only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in @entity3			0
' " ... its plain language encompasses both pre-existing and later - created same - sex ( and polygamous ) marriages , whether performed in @entity3 or elsewhere			1
with crystal clarity , it declares that they are not valid or recognized in @entity3			0
" opponents are also seeking to have the amendment nullified , arguing that it alters the state 's constitution -- meaning the state @entity8 's may ruling -- and therefore , according to state law , is a revision that requires a constitutional convention			1
proponents of the amendment disagree			0
" petitioners ' challenge depends on characterizing proposition 8 as a radical departure from the fundamental principles of the @entity117 , " their briefs said			0
" ... but that portrayal is wildly wrong			0
proposition 8 is limited in nature and effect			0
it does nothing more than restore the definition of marriage to what it was and always had been under @entity3 law before june 16 , 2008 -- and to what the people had repeatedly willed that it be throughout @entity3 's history			0
" @entity3 voters passed a ballot initiative in 2000 that changed the state 's @entity135 to formally define marriage in the state between a man and a woman			1
after @entity142 mayor @entity141 performed same - sex marriages in 2004 , which were promptly annulled , @entity141 and others sought to have the ballot initiative struck down			1
the @entity3 @entity8 did so in may , and same - sex marriages were performed legally in @entity3 a month later			1
the court 's ruling said the right to marry is among a set of basic human rights " so integral to an individual 's liberty and personal autonomy that they may not be eliminated or abrogated by the legislature or by the electorate through the statutory initiative process			2
" but opponents had already been at work on @entity11 , seeking to enshrine the marriage definition in the constitution , and the initiative was approved for the november 4 vote			2
@entity11 supporters also announced the addition of @entity167 to their legal team			0
@entity167 will serve as lead counsel and argue their case to the @entity8			2
@entity167 , the dean of @entity171 , investigated the suicide of @entity176 deputy @entity174 counsel @entity173 and the @entity178 affair			0
the $ 70 million investigation turned up evidence of president @entity176 's affair with @entity182 and led to @entity176 's impeachment by the @entity184			0
he was acquitted by the @entity185 .			0

ballot initiative 's sponsors have filed three lawsuits with @entity138 @entity8
lawsuit seeks to nullify same - sex marriages performed when they were legal
sponsors also respond to lawsuits seeking to invalidate prop 8
