on wednesday , @entity2 's virulent @entity1 affiliate which is known as @entity3 confirmed the death of the group 's deputy leader and co-founder , @entity8 , in a video message posted to jihadist websites			1
it was a confirmation of what was long suspected : that @entity13 was killed in a @entity15 drone strike several months ago			0
and it also amounted to a concession that the @entity2 affiliate is under an enormous amount of pressure			1
in the past three years more than 30 @entity2 leaders and other senior operatives in @entity1 have been killed by @entity15 drone strikes , according to a count by the @entity25			1
the militants killed by those drone strikes included @entity28 , the fiery @entity1 - @entity15 preacher who served as a key ideologue for the group and has been an inspiration for a wide range of militants living in the @entity34 , including the @entity36 brothers who are accused of bombing the @entity37 in april			1
not all of the drone strikes in @entity1 have found their targets			2
@entity25 's review of reliable media reporting of those strikes found that somewhere between 38 and 71 of the casualties were civilians , which included @entity28 's 16 - year - old son			0
a @entity1 tribal leader close to @entity3 says the drone strikes have sown mistrust within the group , where there is " a feeling that the @entity15 have infiltrated its ranks , especially with the killing of several of its leaders			1
" @entity57 , a @entity58 who spent six years at the @entity61 detention facility , was first reported killed in january			0
the @entity1 government quickly confirmed @entity13 's death , but until now @entity3 had denied it			1
@entity3 's video message confirming @entity13 's death was delivered by @entity65 , another @entity58 who was also formerly held at @entity61			2
in the 11Â½ - minute video , which we have reviewed , @entity65 gushes about @entity13 's devotion to @entity2 's cause			2
@entity65 says @entity13 was " searching for martyrdom , " trumpeting his combat against @entity15 forces in @entity73 where he suffered serious injuries to his hands and legs , and lost an eye			0
@entity13 was released from @entity61 in november 2007 , and entered a @entity58 rehabilitation program and was then released			0
@entity65 says @entity13 subsequently planned an attack on the @entity80 in the @entity1 capital , @entity82 , which killed 10 @entity1 policemen and civilians			0
" @entity87 security measures during his telephone calls enabled the enemy to identify and kill him , " @entity65 declared in his eulogy			0
@entity13 's death in the @entity15 drone strike is part of larger story of @entity3 decline over the past two years			1
in 2011 , @entity3 had gained significant territory in @entity1 as it exploited the popular uprising against longtime @entity1 president @entity97			1
its core membership grew from approximately 300 members in 2009 to around 1,000 three years later , according to @entity100 , the author of the authoritative book " the last refuge : @entity1 , @entity2 , and @entity103 in @entity104 "			1
but the jihadist group lost all of these gains within about a year			0
an offensive by the @entity1 army that was supported by @entity15 intelligence last year pushed @entity3 out of the central @entity1 province of @entity112 , forcing @entity3 's fighters to flee to the remote desert province of @entity115			1
the group has since been reduced to carrying out much smaller attacks ; nothing compared to the massive suicide bombing it was able to conduct in the heart of the @entity1 capital in may 2012 , which killed upwards of 100 soldiers as they rehearsed for a military parade			2
and despite its focus on attacking @entity15 targets , @entity3 has not tried to attack one since its october 2010 attempt to plant bombs hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes destined for the @entity15			0
( last year @entity3 plotted to send an operative with explosives in his underwear aboard a plane bound for the @entity15 , but that operative was actually secretly working for the @entity139 and @entity58 intelligence services , so the plot was never a real threat			0
) despite all the losses @entity3 has suffered its capable chief bomb maker , @entity144 , remains at large			0
@entity145 was the brains behind @entity3 's failed " underwear bomb " attempt to bring down a @entity149 - bound @entity15 airliner on christmas day 2009			0
@entity3 's overall leader , @entity151 also remains at large , @entity151 is @entity3 's founder and his continued survival is surely important for the organization			2
@entity3 could regenerate , particularly if @entity1 sees more upheaval , but for now , the group is on the run from the @entity1 army and @entity15 drone strikes , fearful of spies in its midst , is unable to launch large - scale attacks , and boasts a dwindling cadre of leaders			1
@entity3 , in short , is struggling to survive .			2
