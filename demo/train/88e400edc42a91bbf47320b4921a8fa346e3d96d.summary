@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 called monday for the @entity3 to lead a military coalition to help the @entity6 opposition rid the country of president @entity8			1
" the @entity6 opposition needs to know that the @entity3 stands with them and that we are willing to take risks to support them when they need it the most , " the ranking member of the @entity13 told an audience at the @entity15 , a conservative think tank in @entity0			2
" inaction denies us the opportunity to have influence with forces in @entity6 who will one day inherit the country , ceding that to foreign states that may not always share our values			2
" @entity2 took aim at what he said is the @entity29 administration 's toothless policy of calling for @entity8 to step aside			1
" to say they are leading from behind is too general , " he said			2
" that suggests they are leading			0
" the @entity29 administration and much of the rest of the world have put their hopes of ending the 15 months of bloodshed on a peace plan put forth by @entity41 and @entity42 joint special envoy @entity43			1
but that has failed to achieve results			0
the @entity47 senator from @entity48 accused the administration , " in its desperation , " of now appearing to be placing its hopes on persuading the @entity53 government to push @entity8 from power			1
president @entity29 was meeting with @entity53 president @entity56 on monday at the @entity58 meeting in @entity59 , @entity60			1
" @entity53 is unlikely to ever support a policy of regime change in @entity6 , " he said			0
@entity6 - bound @entity53 cargo ship loses insurance the opposition , without help from the @entity3 , has recently improved its military abilities and appears to be well enough organized to make use of outside support , he said			0
though some foreign military assistance appears to be reaching the opposition , it is not enough to be decisive , and may just prolong the crisis , which could prove detrimental , @entity2 said			1
" nearly every @entity6 i speak with tells me the same thing : the longer this conflict drags on , the more radicalized it becomes and the more it turns into an escalating civil war			0
" failure to act could result in @entity6 becoming a failed state , riven by extremist violence and sectarian conflict , he said			0
@entity2 said any military aid should not include @entity3 ground forces , but should include military might from allies of the @entity3 , such as @entity86 and @entity87 countries			1
already , some analysts say that opposition forces may be creating some areas of de facto control , along the border with @entity93 and in eastern @entity6 , @entity2 said			1
one option would be for the opposition to declare those areas liberated , then call for external support in defending them , he said			0
" once defended , these safe havens could become platforms , staging areas for armed opposition groups , " he said			0
@entity2 rejected characterizations of the current state of affairs inside @entity6 as a civil war			2
" it 's not a civil war because all the military strength is on one side , and not the other , " he said			0
" at least we ought to give them a chance to have a fair fight			1
" how dictators have evolved with the times			0

" give them a chance to have a fair fight , " @entity2 says
