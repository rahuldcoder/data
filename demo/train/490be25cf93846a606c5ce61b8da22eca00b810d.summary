@entity0 -- now that the @entity3 has denied landmark status for a building , near " ground zero , " that could house a proposed @entity8 center and mosque , the @entity11 organization behind the project says it will begin moving forward with efforts to make the building " a model for community service and engagement			1
" the commissioners voted unanimously against landmark status for 45 - 47 @entity19			1
it and an adjoining building already connected on the inside , 49 - 51 @entity19 , are owned by real estate developer @entity22 , which intends to build the @entity8 center two blocks north of the former site of the @entity27			1
in a statement on a new website devoted to the project now called @entity33 , the project 's planners said , " until the resolution of the landmarks issue this morning , we were unable to emerge from stage one , as we could not be clear on the impact of a designation on the architecture and design of the building or its program spaces , activities or programming			1
we are eager to begin working with our partners , supporters , neighbors and communities , to build a community center for everyone			0
" " it had been a whirlwind in the past four months , one in which we have worked tirelessly to realize an @entity56 dream which so many other share , " @entity51 , the chief executive officer of @entity22 , said			0
" the outpouring support has exceeded our expectations			0
we are @entity56 ; @entity60			0
we are businessmen , businesswomen , lawyers , doctors , restaurant workers , cab drivers , and professionals of every walk of life represented by the demographic and tapestry of @entity71 , " @entity51 said			0
while the public vote was the focus of much debate about the planned @entity8 center and mosque , the commission could not have prevented the developers from building such a community center			1
the commission , by designating the building a landmark , could only have prevented @entity22 from demolishing the building or significantly altering its exterior			1
@entity11 have been praying peacefully in the building already			2
" we believe that @entity33 will become a landmark in @entity0 's cultural , social and educational life , a community center to promote the @entity56 values we all aspire towards and to realize a better city for all , " said @entity86 , the religious leader of the @entity87 , which will inhabit the building			1
" we will continue going forward with the project			0
it 's a project that will build bridges , " said @entity96 , spokesman for the @entity87			2
it says the group is " committed to promoting positive interaction between the @entity11 world and the @entity103			2
" @entity104 opposed landmark status for the five - story building because it would like to build a taller , modern building			1
" it 's not minarets , " said @entity96 , who described a mock - up of the proposed center as consistent with the latest architecture found in @entity0			2
@entity0 mayor @entity113 and other city leaders support the @entity8 center			1
opponents , including former vice presidential candidate @entity117 , have argued against a mosque being so close to the scene of the nation 's worst terrorist attack			0
" peace - seeking @entity11 , pls understand , @entity124 mosque is unnecessary provocation ; it stabs hearts			2
pls reject it in interest of healing , " tweeted @entity117 last month on her @entity128 account			0
the @entity133 , an organization that battles anti-semitism and other forms of bigotry , is asking that the @entity8 center and mosque be built farther away from ground zero in consideration of families who lost loved ones during the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" building an @entity145 in the shadow of the @entity27 will cause some victims more pain -- unnecessarily -- and that is not right , " said the organization in a written statement			0
the @entity3 pointed out prior to its decision that it would have nothing to do with the planned use of the structure			0
" the purpose of tomorrow 's vote is to decide whether the building has a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or value as part of the development , heritage or cultural characteristics of @entity0 , @entity165 or the nation , " commission spokeswoman @entity154 said monday			0
most recently the home of a @entity169 retailer , 45 - 47 @entity19 was completed in 1858			1
the @entity170 described it as " a prominent example of the store and loft structures that dominated the dry goods warehouse districts of @entity71 " during the era .			0

new : a @entity11 group says it will begin moving forward with plans for an @entity8 center near " ground zero "
new : the @entity87 's and @entity22 ' project is now called @entity33 , as it will inhabit 45 - 51 @entity19
if landmark status was **n't** denied , it would have meant the building could **n't** be demolished or *greatly* altered
mosque organizers opposed landmark status ; they want a taller , modern building
