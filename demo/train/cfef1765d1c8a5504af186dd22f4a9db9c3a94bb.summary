-- for generations , hundreds of millions of sports fans have seen the iconic @entity4 blimp hanging out above stadiums across the nation			1
ever wonder how the thing actually flies ? this 192 - foot - long aircraft is a machine with its own set of rules			2
it 's very different from an airplane			2
for one , obviously , it has no wings			0
two , it typically flies about 1,500 feet above the ground			0
compare that with @entity20 's @entity19 , which towers about 1,050 feet high			2
and another thing : @entity4 's blimps move ... very ... slowly			1
they max out at about 53 mph but usually they cruise at a conservative 35 mph			0
here are three basic things to know about blimps : -- blimps belong to a family of aircraft called " airships , " defined as aircraft that do n't use wings to fly			1
instead they are lifted by helium			0
-- what 's a blimp , exactly ? a blimp is an airship that has no internal framework to keep its helium gas bag rigid			1
that giant gas bag is what pilots call the " envelope			2
" -- pilots power and steer blimps with two propeller engines and a moveable tail and rudder system			1
we 'll have more on exactly how it all works later this week after @entity0 flies above @entity56 's @entity55 bowl tuesday night with @entity4 blimp pilot @entity58 and camera operator @entity59			1
@entity58 's flying background is rooted in airplanes			2
but to learn to fly a blimp , he says , " you have to throw a lot of that away			2
this is a real seat - of - your - pants flyer			2
i mean , you feel it			0
" compared with blimps , airplanes respond very quickly			0
but flying a blimp is an exercise in anticipation			0
you have to anticipate what the ship 's going to do before it does it			0
then , almost as soon as a shift starts happening , you have to reverse it because otherwise it will keep happening long after you want it to stop			0
belle of the bowls during this college football bowl season , blimps will be all over the map			0
in addition to the @entity90 , @entity4 's three airships are set to hover over @entity92 's @entity91 , @entity94 's @entity93 , @entity96 's @entity95 , @entity98 's @entity97 and the @entity99 january 6 in @entity100 , @entity94			1
ever wonder what it 's like up there in the gondola ? ever ponder the " rules of the road " when it comes to flying a huge aircraft close to skyscrapers and towering antennas ? during the game broadcasts , how do the tv director , the pilot and the blimp camera operator coordinate to get those beautiful aerial skyline shots of the stadiums ? got a question for the crew ? share it in the comments section below and we 'll try to get it answered			1
if the weather cooperates , the blimp will provide live beauty shots for @entity127 's coverage of @entity128 versus @entity129			1
on the field , 2012 @entity131 winner @entity130 -- aka @entity130 -- will quarterback the @entity133 , while in the sky over the @entity135 , we 'll go behind - the - scenes to reveal more details about what it takes to fly a true @entity141 icon			0
meantime , here are a few pieces of blimp trivia : 1			0
' everyone 's looking up ' how did @entity4 get into the airship business ? in a word : rubber			1
pretty much everybody knows @entity4 makes tires and other rubber products			1
in 1917 , when the @entity152 needed airships that included rubberized fabrics and coatings , @entity4 came calling			1
the first @entity4 airships for the @entity152 were based along the @entity157 and were used for training , patrols and search and rescue operations			1
@entity4 started operating its own airships in 1919			1
little did @entity4 know its blimps would become one of the best - known corporate symbols in the @entity141			1
the company now estimates some 60 million @entity141 get a first - hand look at its three @entity141 blimps every year			2
" sometimes you 'll go over a high school or middle school that 's having football practice and when we fly over , practice stops , " says @entity58 , captain of " @entity168 , " @entity4 's youngest airship			1
" everyone 's looking up			0
eyes in the sky @entity4 kicked off its first blimp event coverage in 1955 at the @entity93 and parade in @entity100 , @entity94 , according to the tire maker			1
nearly 60 years later , @entity4 performed another first : aerial tv coverage by two blimps simultaneously			1
it happened at a football game in november between @entity185 and the @entity186 at @entity187			0
" in some ways , the @entity4 blimp is as much a part of football as tailgating or as hotdogs are to baseball , " said 20 - year veteran airship historian @entity188			1
" you can imagine football without it , but it would be kind of sad			0
it has become part of our national consciousness			0
dude , @entity201 ! beginning in 2014 , @entity4 plans to start phasing out its blimps to make room for a new generation of airships : the @entity206 the envelopes of the @entity208 have semi-rigid internal frames made of lightweight carbon fiber			1
so , technically , these new @entity4 airships wo n't be blimps			1
hmmmm ... will folks start calling them " @entity4 semi-rigid airships ? " doubtful			1
in fact , @entity4 calls them @entity218 , which stands for " new technology			2
" the company is building them in partnership with @entity224 manufacturer @entity223			0
that 's the forerunner of the firm that built the infamous airship the @entity228 , which blew up during a @entity230 landing in 1937			0
unlike that @entity206 , nts fly with helium , not the dangerously flammable hydrogen that destroyed the @entity228			0
the @entity208 will be more than 50 feet longer , 20 mph faster and more maneuverable than @entity4 's blimps			1
" it 'll carry more passengers , " says @entity58			0
" and the two engines attached to a frame midway up the envelope will swivel , allowing it to take off and land more like a helicopter in tighter spots			0
and on top of that , the new airship 's going to be a lot faster			2
" as previously mentioned , the blimps max out at around 53 mph , while the @entity201 are expected to top out at around 70 mph			0
" its abilities are just phenomenal , " @entity58 says			0
auto - deflate mechanism even when they 're on the ground , the blimps are extremely vulnerable to high winds			1
a special latch on the nose of the blimps keeps it attached to a mast			0
@entity4 says failure of that latch is very unlikely , but if the blimp does break away from the mast , it 's designed to automatically deflate to prevent it from floating away			1
razzle - dazzle next time you see breathtaking video above a sports stadium from a @entity263 , think about this : video beams from the airship to the ground via microwaves are sent to a microwave dish and a receiver , which then feeds video to the tv network			0
@entity4 uses its own camera operators and specially designed tv equipment to shoot those beauty shots			2
thousands of led lights across the surface of the blimps create a bit of razzle - dazzle signage			2
the company calls it @entity282 , describing it as a " computer driven , electronic system which reads data and then sends out millions of commands to turn the lights on and off with different colors at the proper instant creating text and animations brilliant enough to be seen up to one mile away			0

@entity4 began making blimps in 1917
@entity295 is a blimp 's worst enemy ; pilots control blimps with an odd steering wheel
@entity4 blimps have an auto - deflating system in case of *emergencies*
@entity4 plans an *upgrade* to faster , longer @entity309 airships in 2014
