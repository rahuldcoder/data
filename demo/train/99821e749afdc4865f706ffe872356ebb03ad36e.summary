@entity0 -- the full @entity2 formally kicks off debate tuesday on the bipartisan " @entity5 " immigration reform bill -- a plan which , if enacted , will create a 13 - year path to citizenship for most of @entity10 's 11 million undocumented immigrants			1
among other things , the measure aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high - skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low - skilled workers on @entity10 's farms and elsewhere			1
" this week , the @entity2 will consider a commonsense , bipartisan bill that is the best chance we 've had in years to fix our broken immigration system , " president @entity20 said tuesday			2
" if you genuinely believe we need to fix our broken immigration system , there 's no good reason to stand in the way of this bill			2
" needless to say , a lot of folks on @entity33 disagree with the president			0
" this bill has serious flaws , " warned senate minority leader @entity34 , @entity35			0
" there will need to be major changes to this bill if it 's going to become law			2
" here are five key things to know about the state of play on this controversial issue : 1 ) the ' @entity5 ' remains unified eight men put the bipartisan @entity2 bill together -- @entity50 @entity49 @entity48 , @entity52 @entity49 @entity51 , @entity54 @entity49 @entity53 , @entity52 @entity49 @entity55 , @entity57 democrat @entity56 , @entity59 democrat @entity58 , @entity61 democrat @entity60 , and @entity63 democrat @entity62			1
each of the eight has promised to oppose any major changes to the bill			0
during @entity68 's consideration of roughly 300 proposed amendments , @entity51 and @entity48 repeatedly sided with the panel 's @entity70 in opposing significant changes offered by their fellow conservatives			0
@entity62 and @entity58 voted against some amendments proposed by more liberal members , even though the pair said they supported the ideas			0
@entity53 was disappointed that the committee rejected an amendment requiring the use of biometrics -- such as fingerprints -- for visa holders at all of the country 's entry and exit points			2
but he has n't dropped his support for the overall bill			0
" everybody needs to know it -- who 's calling the shots , " conservative @entity91 sen. @entity90 said at one of the committee 's meetings on the bill			2
the answer , at least so far , remains the " @entity5			2
" 2 ) reform advocates have momentum , but there 's a long way to go advocates for comprehensive immigration reform won their first major legislative victory last month when the @entity68 voted 13 - 5 to approve the " @entity5 " plan			1
the committee 's tally was significant in part because three @entity49 -- @entity51 , @entity48 , and @entity113 's @entity112 -- joined the panel 's democrats in backing the measure			1
assuming every member of the @entity70 caucus backs the bill on the @entity2 floor , five republicans will be needed to ensure it receives the 60 votes needed to pass the 100 - member chamber			1
he bill 's backers have been hoping for as many as 70 votes , in order to give the proposal significant bipartisan momentum heading into the tougher @entity91 - controlled @entity132			1
the @entity2 voted 82 - 15 to open debate , an important tally but in no way a predictor of how the issue will play out			0
make no mistake -- serious momentum will be needed in the @entity132 , where conservatives remain deeply skeptical about border security and any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally			1
a lot of conservatives consider the current proposed path to be a form of amnesty , which may as well be a four - letter word in this debate			0
any measure that passes the @entity132 will almost certainly have to be reconciled with the @entity2 plan in a conference committee			1
and assuming that can be done , both chambers would then have to pass the compromise legislation			0
3 ) it 's not clear anything can pass the @entity132 a bipartisan working group in the @entity132 -- similar to the @entity2 's " @entity5 " -- has been on the verge of unveiling legislation for months , according to multiple sources			1
but it has n't been able to seal the deal , and one of the @entity49 in the group recently dropped out			0
@entity168 rep. @entity167 said he was frustrated he could n't get support for a provision ensuring undocumented workers are barred from any taxpayer - funded health care benefits			0
for his part , speaker @entity173 , @entity174 , has repeatedly said he supports the work of the @entity132 bipartisan group			0
he wo n't , however , weigh in on any policy details			0
a number of congressional observers believe that after experiencing a backlash from many of his rank and file members for cutting " backroom deals " on other issues , @entity173 wants time to educate his caucus on immigration reform and gain some buy - in for any bill or set of bills			0
@entity173 could antagonize many of his members if he decides to move forward with a bill requiring a majority of @entity70 votes to pass			1
" if the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in the passage despite a majority of the @entity49 conference voting against it , then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election , " @entity91 rep. @entity198 recently told @entity1			1
4 ) immigration is @entity20 's best shot for big second - term legislative win why ? democrats are basically unified on the issue , while @entity49 are divided			2
on sunday , @entity213 's @entity212 became the first @entity91 senator outside of the " @entity5 " to publicly endorse the group 's plan			1
" this is a thoughtful , bipartisan solution to a tough problem , " she said on @entity218 's " @entity217			0
" nothing focuses a politician 's attention like an election loss , and republicans were thumped last year by the country 's growing @entity227 population			0
latinos backed @entity20 over @entity230 by a 44 - point margin			0
@entity91 strategists are concerned about the party 's long term viability in national elections if that trend is not reversed			1
some congressional conservatives have already said opposing the " @entity5 's " plan is a matter of principle and they wo n't bend			1
this is a rare moment when the two political parties ' priorities may overlap enough to make @entity33 a productive place			0
5 ) polls -- what does the public think ? most national polling conducted over the past few months indicate majority support for an eventual pathway to citizenship , as long as undocumented workers clear a series of hurdles such as paying back taxes and fines			1
support for a pathway ranges from nearly 60 % to almost 80 % of @entity10 , depending on the poll			1
@entity1 poll : most see pathway to citizenship 65 % of @entity10 back a pathway to citizenship as long as it requires payment of back taxes and fines , according to a may 30 - june 2 @entity272 / @entity271 poll			1
77 % of @entity70 support a pathway under such circumstances , compared to 58 % of @entity49 and 54 % of independents			2
people are skeptical , however , about the ability of @entity278 to get the job done , according to a may 22 - 28 @entity281 survey			0
only 24 % of the @entity281 poll 's respondents believe congressional @entity70 and @entity49 can work together to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill			1
71 % of @entity10 do n't expect enough bipartisan cooperation to pass such legislation , according to the survey			2
@entity1 's @entity287 , @entity288 , and @entity289 contributed to this report			0

backers of " @entity5 " plan have momentum , but there 's a long way to go
the bill will require at least 60 votes -- *including* some @entity49 -- to pass the @entity2
" @entity5 " bill currently faces stiff *opposition* in the @entity132
polls show majority of @entity10 back a pathway to citizenship for undocumented residents
