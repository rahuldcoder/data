-- the rev. @entity2 's church practices what he calls the 11th commandment : " thou shalt not be boring			1
" @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , also practices something many other black churches do n't : integration			1
" we 're fully integrated in the workplace , schools , public restaurants everywhere , except the church , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" it 's still the most segregated place on sunday in the @entity19			1
our goal is to do what heaven has already done			0
" but most churches are n't			1
nine of 10 churches are segregated , according to an analysis by @entity27 and @entity28 published in the august addition of the journal @entity31			1
for the purposes of the paper , " segregated " meant 80 percent of a church 's members were of one race			1
" people choose churches where they feel comfortable			1
maybe they get challenges there , but they 're going for the comfort , " says @entity28 , a sociology professor at @entity39 in @entity40			0
titled " race , @entity51 , and @entity52 in @entity53 , " the analysis concluded that even when people join a church as minority members , they are less likely to stay as long as the majority			1
this , the paper 's abstract says , " can create a constant pull toward homogeneity despite congregational efforts to diversify			0
" some argue that diversification is in the best interest of @entity6 because african - americans make just 2 percent of the 3.2 million people in @entity7 , while more than 78 percent of the people in the county are white			1
@entity2 argues integration should be happening at every church , because he says most of the issues that blacks , whites and everyone else struggle with are the same			2
" we have problems with our kids			2
we have problems with bills			2
we have problems on the job			2
" but some @entity81 commentators disagree			0
" the black church is our best institution , " says @entity82 , co-editor for reelurbannews.com and former managing editor of the @entity85			2
" it 's ours -- it 's the one last place in the world that we can call our own			0
" on his website , @entity82 says many african - americans are changing from historically black churches to religious houses that are predominantly white			2
but pastor @entity94 of @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity8 , says black churches ca n't afford to lose members to other churches			1
@entity94 said it creates a great burden on the church financially and leaves a void for younger african - americans culturally			0
he thinks the church needs to adapt to make more people more comfortable attending black churches			1
interracial churches can be the scene of internal battles , as @entity0 has reported previously			0
some of those tug - of - wars can be over preaching styles or music			0
differing views on interracial dating and the appropriate racial mix of church leaders can also cause tension			0
@entity28 and co-author @entity27 , a senior research assistant at @entity119 discovered that many church minority members feel they have no say in church affairs , though this starts to change when a minority reaches 40 percent of the church population			1
more than 3,000 people attend @entity6			0
@entity126 has been attending for 10 years , said he 's never felt uncomfortable there			0
other churches could learn a lesson from his worship community , he says			0
" i think as other black churches are beginning to see what 's happening and just the burgeoning growth of @entity6 , i think they may take a different look at their agenda and say maybe we should kind of open up our churches			0
" @entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0

pastor says all races share many problems of daily life
not all people think segregated churches are a *bad* idea
churches need to adapt to make all races feel more comfortable , *experts* say
