-- @entity1 have long occupied a special place in the heart of the @entity4			1
but that has not done them very much good			0
over the past year , as the world focused on the @entity11 uprisings , and as @entity13 's growth shadowed over a weak global economy , the @entity1 struggle for autonomy entered a disturbing phase			1
from a distance , it might have looked as if @entity13 thoroughly succeeded in crushing @entity19 's hope			1
but at home , in a western part of @entity13 , tibetans are giving notice that their struggle is not over			2
@entity13 authorities would do well to reconsider their strong - arm approach , because with or without @entity28 attention , the @entity1 will continue their fight			1
it started in march of last year when a young @entity1 monk , @entity31 , set himself on fire in a protest against @entity13 's policies			1
since then , some 30 other @entity1 , mostly monks , have doused themselves with fuel and lit the spark that turned them into human torches , shouting cries for freedom and for the return of the @entity41 to his homeland , before collapsing and writhing in pain			1
@entity44 has responded with crackdowns			2
but despite a large presence of security forces and some 21,000 @entity50 officials , the self - immolations continue			0
most of the cases have occurred in a remote area that allows @entity13 authorities to easily block out foreign reporters			2
@entity56 groups say @entity1 protests occur daily			0
news about these occurrences has been sparse until this week , when the self - immolations crossed the @entity13 borders into @entity62			0
on monday , 26 - year - old @entity63 set himself on fire before cameras in @entity66 during a demonstration to protest the visit of @entity13 's president @entity69			1
the gasp - inducing photographs of @entity63 in flames stunned the world			0
on wednesday , the @entity1 government in exile said that yet another monk set himself on fire			1
@entity77 died of his wounds			0
@entity13 troops , according to @entity1 officials , took away his body despite his family 's pleas			1
@entity44 blames the horrific practice on the @entity41 , calling the self - immolations " terrorism , " even though the actions have no victims other than those who die at their own hand			1
in addition to trying to suppress @entity1 demands by brute force , as they have done for decades , @entity13 officials have continued a propaganda campaign against the @entity41 , @entity19 's spiritual leader , providing a version of events that leaps across the bounds of the credible			1
for years , @entity13 officials have called the @entity41 " a monster with a human face , " and a " wolf in a monk 's robe			1
" most recently , @entity44 accused him of masterminding the gruesome protests			0
a government - run website accused the @entity41 of espousing " nazi racial policies , " and single - handedly crafting the self - immolations as part of a campaign of racial segregation			0
@entity13 regularly refers to the aging monk as a " splittist " who aims to divide @entity13 to achieve @entity1 independence			1
in fact , the @entity41 long ago gave up his call for independence , instead pursuing a " @entity120 , " which seeks genuine autonomy within @entity13 , with freedom for @entity1 to preserve their culture and ensure their survival as an ethnic group			1
in addition , he has remained an ardent supporter of nonviolence , rejecting the campaign of self - immolations while offering prayers for those who died in the incidents			0
the @entity1 government in exile has also sharply decried the violent practice			2
from its base in @entity135 , in northern @entity62 , it has stated that " as @entity137 , life is precious , " urging @entity1 to " refrain from drastic actions			0
" but despite the @entity41 's position , @entity44 refuses to hold talks and continues to flood @entity1 areas with @entity142 , diluting the local population and limiting @entity1 monastic practices			1
the @entity41 , who has achieved rock star status in much of the world , has done much to rally the @entity4 to his cause			2
but his effort only goes so far			0
given @entity13 's increasing economic clout , even president @entity149 tried to avoid upsetting the @entity13 government on the @entity19 issue			2
when the @entity41 visited the president in 2010 , he had to leave the @entity154 through a back door -- in front of garbage bags -- to lower the profile of the visit			0
the president later met him more openly in the face of criticism			0
@entity13 has the upper hand now , but it would do well to reassess its view of the @entity1 leader			2
it may hope that after his death , the @entity1 movement will lose strength			0
but the wave of immolations indicates that the opposite may happen			0
@entity1 are getting impatient with the @entity41 's nonviolent approach			2
after all , @entity13 has shown no signs of easing repression for those living under its rule			0
the @entity13 have said that they want stability , but its misguided policies on @entity19 only create conditions for more instability			2
if @entity13 does n't step up , then the @entity4 must help @entity1 make the point that an end to repression is the fastest road to stability			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

since march 2011 , 30 @entity1 have set themselves on fire in protest of @entity13
@entity194 : @entity44 blames the horrific practice on the @entity41 , but he urges nonviolence
@entity198 : @entity41 is popular in the @entity4 , but heads of state ca n't do much to help @entity19
@entity198 : unless @entity13 changes its polices toward @entity1 , it will only see more *unrest*
