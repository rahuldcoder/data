-- a @entity2 student got a visit from the @entity4 this week after he found a secret gps tracking device on his car , and a friend posted photos of it online			1
the post prompted wide speculation about whether the device was real , whether the young @entity13 was being targeted in a terrorism investigation and what the authorities would do			1
it took just 48 hours to find out : the device was real , the student was being secretly tracked and the @entity4 wanted their expensive device back , the student told @entity22 in an interview wednesday			1
the answer came when half - a - dozen @entity4 agents and police officers appeared at @entity28 's apartment complex in @entity29 , @entity2 , on tuesday demanding he return the device			1
@entity28 , a 20 - year - old @entity31 - born citizen , cooperated willingly and said he 'd done nothing to merit attention from authorities			2
comments the agents made during their visit suggested he 'd been under @entity4 surveillance for three to six months			1
an @entity4 spokesman would n't acknowledge that the device belonged to the agency or that agents appeared at @entity28 's house			1
" i ca n't really tell you much about it , because it 's still an ongoing investigation , " said spokesman @entity44 , who works in the agency 's @entity46 headquarters			2
@entity28 , the son of an @entity52 - @entity31 community leader who died a year ago in @entity53 , is one of only a few people known to have found a government - tracking device on their vehicle			1
his discovery comes in the wake of a recent ruling by the 9th @entity60 saying it 's legal for law enforcement to secretly place a tracking device on a suspect 's car without getting a warrant , even if the car is parked in a private driveway			1
@entity68 from the @entity69 in @entity70 contacted @entity28 after seeing pictures of the tracking device posted online and told him the @entity69 had been waiting for a case like this to challenge the ruling			1
" this is the kind of thing we like to throw lawyers at , " @entity28 said @entity68 told him			2
" it seems very frightening that the @entity4 have placed a surveillance - tracking device on the car of a 20 - year - old @entity31 citizen who has done nothing more than being half - @entity53 , " @entity68 told @entity22 @entity28 , a business marketing student at @entity84 in @entity29 , discovered the device last sunday when he took his car to a local garage for an oil change			1
when a mechanic at @entity90 raised his @entity91 on hydraulic lifts , @entity28 saw a wire sticking out near the right rear wheel and exhaust			2
garage owner @entity96 confirmed for @entity22 that he also saw it			2
a closer inspection showed it connected to a battery pack and transmitter , which were attached to the car with a magnet			1
@entity96 asked @entity28 if he wanted the device removed and when @entity28 said yes , @entity96 pulled it easily from the car 's chassis			1
" i would n't have noticed it if there was n't a wire sticking out , " @entity28 said			2
later that day , a friend of @entity28 's named @entity110 posted pictures of the device at @entity113 asking if anyone knew what it was and if it mean the @entity4 " is after us			1
" ( @entity113 is owned by @entity119 , which also owns @entity22 )			1
" my plan was to just put the device on another car or in a lake , " @entity110 wrote , " but when you come home to 2 stoned off their asses people who are hearing things in the device and convinced its a bomb you just got ta be sure			1
" a reader quickly identified it as an @entity134 tracking device made by an electronics company called @entity136 , which sells the device only to law enforcement			1
no one was available at @entity136 to answer @entity22 's questions , but a former @entity4 agent who looked at the pictures confirmed it was a tracking device			1
the former agent , who asked not to be named , said the device was an older model of tracking equipment that had long ago been replaced by devices that do n't require batteries			1
batteries die and need to be replaced if surveillance is ongoing so newer devices are placed in the engine compartment and hardwired to the car 's battery so they do n't run out of juice			1
he was surprised this one was so easily found			1
" it has to be able to be removed but also stay in place and not be seen , " he said			0
" there 's always the possibility that the car will end up at a body shop or auto mechanic , so it has to be hidden well			1
it 's very rare when the guys find them			0
" he said he was certain that agents who installed it would have obtained a 30 - day warrant for its use			1
@entity28 considered selling the device on @entity176 before the @entity4 showed up			1
he was in his apartment tuesday afternoon when a roommate told him " two sneaky - looking people " were near his car			1
@entity28 , already heading out for an appointment , encountered a man and woman looking his vehicle outside			0
the man asked if @entity28 knew his registration tag was expired			2
when @entity28 asked if it bothered him , the man just smiled			2
@entity28 got into his car and headed for the parking lot exit when two suvs pulled up with flashing lights carrying four police officers in bullet - proof vests			2
the agent who initially spoke with @entity28 identified himself then as @entity193 and told @entity28 , " we 're here to recover the device you found on your vehicle			1
it 's an expensive piece , and we need it right now			0
" @entity28 asked , " are you the guys that put it there ? " and the agent replied , " yeah , i put it there			2
" he told @entity209 , " we 're going to make this much more difficult for you if you do n't cooperate			0
" @entity28 retrieved the device from his apartment and handed it over , at which point the agents asked a series of questions -- did he know anyone who traveled to @entity218 or was affiliated with overseas training ? one of the agents produced a printout of a blog post that @entity28 's friend @entity110 allegedly wrote a couple of months ago			1
it had " something to do with a mall or a bomb , " @entity28 said			0
he had n't seen it before and does n't know the details of what it said			0
he found it hard to believe @entity110 meant anything threatening by the post			2
" he 's a smart kid and is not affiliated with anything extreme and never says anything stupid like that , " @entity28 said			0
" i 've known that guy my whole life			0
" the agents told @entity28 they had other agents outside @entity110 's house			2
" if you want us to call them off and not talk to him we can do that , " @entity28 said they told him			0
... i did n't really believe anything they were saying			0
" when he later asked @entity110 about the post , his friend recalled " writing something stupid , " but said he was n't involved in any wrongdoing			1
@entity110 declined to discuss the issue with @entity22			0
the female agent , who handed @entity28 a card , identified herself as @entity257 and said she was @entity258			0
she spoke some @entity259 to @entity28 and through the course of her comments indicated she knew what restaurants he and his girlfriend frequented			0
she also congratulated him on his new job			0
@entity28 got laid off from his job a couple of days ago , but on the same day was hired as an international sales manager of laptops and computers for @entity269 in @entity270			0
the agents also knew he was planning a short business trip to @entity273 in a few weeks			2
@entity28 said he often travels for business and has two teenage brothers in @entity53 whom he supports financially			0
they live with an aunt			0
his @entity31 - born mother , who divorced his father five years ago , lives in @entity281			0
@entity28 's father , @entity209 , was a @entity31 citizen and former president of the @entity284 here , before his family moved to @entity53 in 2003			0
@entity28 returned to the @entity31 alone in 2008 , while his father and brothers stayed in @entity53 , to further his education he said			0
he knows he 's on a federal watchlist and is regularly taken aside at airports for secondary screening			0
six months ago , a former roommate of his was visited by @entity4 agents who said they wanted to speak with @entity28			1
@entity28 contacted one agent and was told the agency received an anonymous tip from someone saying he might be a threat to national security			0
@entity28 told the agent he was willing to answer questions if his lawyer approved			0
but after @entity28 's lawyer contacted the agency , he never heard from the feds again until he found their tracking device			1
" i do n't think they were surprised that i found it , " he told @entity307			2
" i 'm sure they knew when i found it			2
... one of the first questions they asked me was if i was at a mechanics shop last sunday			2
i said yes , that 's where i found this stupid device under my car			1
" @entity28 's attorney , who works for the civil liberties - focused @entity321 , said this kind of tracking is more egregious than the kind her office usually sees			0
" the idea that it escalates to this level is unusual , " said @entity326			0
" we take about one new case each week relating to @entity4 or law enforcement visits [ to clients ]			1
generally they come to the individual 's house or workplace , and there are issues that arise from that			0
" however , she said that after learning about @entity28 's experience , other lawyers in her organization told her they knew of two people in @entity346 who also recently discovered tracking devices on their vehicles			0
@entity28 's encounter with the @entity4 ended with the agents telling him not to worry			1
" we have all the information we needed , " they told him			0
" you do n't need to call your lawyer			0
do n't worry , you 're boring			0
" they shook his hand and left			0
