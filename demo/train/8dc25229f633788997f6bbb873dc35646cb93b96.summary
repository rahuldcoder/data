-- when my wife woke me up before dawn about three months ago to tell me she was having contractions , one of the first things i did was grab my @entity7 from the nightstand			1
no , i was n't ignoring my wife to check my e-mail or send a tweet			0
i picked up my smartphone so i could use a 99 - cent app to track the duration and frequency of those contractions			1
you might think that using apps and gadgets right before and after your child is born will take away from this life - changing experience			0
but for my wife and me , having the right tech tools enhanced the experience and made us feel more connected to our out - of - town friends and family			0
here are five tech tools that have come in handy for this new dad			0
@entity7 app ( 99 cents ) each time my wife signaled that a contraction was starting , i tapped the app 's start button and when it was over , i hit stop -- generating a report that made it easy to track her progress			1
i could e-mail that data to our @entity38 , or if i was really bold , share it on @entity40 or @entity41			0
using the app provided some order and calmness to what is often a chaotic experience			2
total @entity48 app ( $ 4.99 ) after our son @entity50 was born and we settled into the hospital room , nurses started coming in and peppering us with questions : how many times did the baby pee today ? when was the last time he ate ? were you able to breastfeed ? for how long ? are you sure this is your baby ? ( kidding )			2
once we left the hospital , there were more questions			0
at the first pediatrician visit , the doctor wanted daily totals for the number of dirty and wet diapers as well as more details on the frequency and length of breast - or bottle - feeding sessions			2
what were his height , weight and length at birth ? when he left the hospital ? total baby makes it easy to keep track of every dirty diaper , bottle , nap and even bath			1
as a new parent , it 's easy to obsess over these early details , and while this app can feed that obsession , it put me at ease to know that all the vital information about my son was only a few taps away			1
we also used the app to keep track of upcoming and past doctor 's appointments , to write down questions for the doctor and track @entity50 's growth			1
since i always carry my @entity7 with me , i use the app to document milestones like @entity50 's first bath or the first time he smiled			1
each entry automatically records the date and time , and you can add a photo to go with it			0
one of the best things about the app is if you download it on multiple iphones or @entity117 , you can use your home @entity119 network to sync the data			1
we downloaded it on two iphones and an @entity117 , so regardless of which gadget we use to update the app , it only takes a few seconds to sync so we have the latest data on all of our devices			1
@entity117 ( starts at $ 499 ) after more than two months as the father of a newborn , i 'm now convinced that @entity132 had new parents in mind when he designed the ipad 2			2
there are many nights where my son wo n't fall asleep unless he 's cradled in the crook of my arm			2
that leaves me with one free hand -- not enough to flip through a book or use a laptop			0
the @entity117 is the perfect size and shape to balance on my lap or chair armrest and manipulate with my free hand			1
my @entity117 has become my mobile command center to entertain and inform myself and to share news and photos of my son with friends and family			2
i 'll catch up on news and social - networking feeds through apps like @entity0 , @entity156 , @entity40 and @entity157			0
when i want to watch tv without disturbing the baby , i 'll plug in my headphones and use apps such as @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity0 and @entity164			0
and of course like any new parent , i 'll use @entity167 to get answers to burning questions like " why does my baby have hiccups ? " or " when does the umbilical cord fall off ? " the @entity117 is also great for storing and displaying pictures			2
when relatives visited , i set the @entity117 to slideshow mode and propped it upon the living room table to use as a digital picture frame			2
to make loading photos onto the @entity117 easier , i bought the $ 29 @entity179 to transfer photos and videos from an sd card and my @entity7			1
it 's easier than dumping photos onto a computer , but you will need two hands			0
web albums @entity7 / @entity117 app ( $ 1.99 ) like any new parent , i was eager to share photos of our son on @entity41 , but i did n't always have my computer handy			1
there 's no official @entity196 ( yet ) , and the @entity7 app only lets you upload one photo at a time			1
the web albums app for @entity7 and @entity117 lets me upload batches of photos to @entity41 at the same time and create and easily manage my @entity41 photo albums			1
the app also let me upload multiple photos and manage albums on @entity167 's @entity209 service			2
it even saves photos for offline viewing and the app features a nice slideshow function			0
@entity215 we heard lots of opinions on the best place to buy diapers and other baby stuff			1
we joined @entity215 's free but unfortunately named @entity222 ( the account is in my name ) to get discounts on lots of stuff			1
for diapers and wipes , we signed up for @entity215 's subscription service called " @entity231			1
" the service delivers items to your door at set intervals of your choosing			0
you can cancel at anytime or change the type of diapers or wipes			0
for instance , with the @entity245 discount , a shipment of 234 @entity243 diapers costs about $ 31 , or 13 cents a diaper			0
that 's about $ 12 less than @entity249			0
