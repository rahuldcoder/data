@entity0 -- @entity2 joined brothers @entity3 and @entity5 on tuesday in opposing the october tribute concert for @entity7 because it takes place during the trial of the doctor charged in their brother 's death			1
while @entity2 stopped short of criticizing the promoters or other members of her family who support the tribute , she did put to rest any rumors that she would perform in it			0
" because of the trial , the timing of this tribute to our brother would be too difficult for me , " she said in a statement sent to @entity1 by her representative tuesday			2
promoters had held out hope that @entity2 , who currently has the most vibrant career of the musical family , would attend " @entity32 : the @entity33 , " set for a 75,000 - seat arena in @entity35 , @entity36 , on october 8			1
the biggest name on the concert bill is @entity39 , although she will not perform live			0
instead , the audience will watch a video of @entity39 singing a @entity7 song			2
@entity43 was recently added to the show , which will also headline @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
a fan uproar forced promoters to boot @entity53 from the lineup because of negative comments the rock band 's bassist , @entity56 , made about @entity7 in the weeks after his june 25 , 2009 , death			2
members of the @entity60 taking the stage october 8 include several of @entity7 's brothers , " the next generation of @entity64 , " and @entity65 , which consists of @entity67 's three sons , the promoters said			1
the jackson family has been publicly split over the concert since brothers @entity70 , @entity67 and @entity72 , sister @entity73 and family matriarch @entity75 announced their support for it in july			0
@entity3 and @entity5 quickly issued a statement opposing the show because it would happen in the middle of dr. @entity82 's involuntary manslaughter trial , which starts next month			1
prosecutors accuse the doctor of being responsible for the drug overdose that killed @entity7			0
" we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family , " the two brothers said in a joint statement			0
" while we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding @entity7 's death			1
" @entity75 told @entity1 she understands her children 's objections to the timing of the show , but she felt it is appropriate			0
while she will attend most of the @entity82 trial in a @entity0 courtroom , she told @entity1 she would travel to @entity36 for the tribute			1
