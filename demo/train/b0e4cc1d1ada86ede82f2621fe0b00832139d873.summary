the impact of the drought currently gripping the @entity2 is real and tangible , as millions can attest			2
but the depth of the pain still falls short of that experienced by many in the @entity7 and beyond during the so - called @entity9 era of the 1930s			0
here is a look -- by the numbers -- comparing what happened then and what 's happening now , both times due to pervasive and historic droughts			0
the @entity9 days 8 : the years of the general duration of the so - called @entity9 era , from 1931 to 1939 3.5 million : people who left their homes in the @entity7 and beyond due to drought 250,000 : families who lost their farms and ranches to bank foreclosures 60 mph : speed of winds pushing a huge dust cloud on april 13 , 1935 , through @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and beyond -- causing hundreds of deaths -- during what is called " @entity36 " 5 : the string of years in the 1930s of the warmest temperatures ever recorded until recently in @entity40 , @entity31 74 : the degrees of temperature drop in an 18 - hour span in @entity44 , @entity32 , in february 1933 , as @entity9 winters were often bitterly cold 20 million : hectares of range and farmland ruined annually during the @entity9 era 13 : the number of camps , consisting of about 300 families each , set up by the @entity53 for @entity9 migrants escaping the hardest hit areas the current drought 40 : number of the 50 states with drought - designated counties as determined by the federal government , making them eligible for emergency aid 63 % : amount of the contiguous @entity2 experiencing moderate to exceptional drought conditions 33 % : amount of the contiguous @entity2 in such straits last year , indicating 30 % more of the country now faces such conditions # 1 : the historic rank for july 2012 , nationally , in temperature , making it the hottest july since records were first kept in 1895 123.4 : the bushels of corn per acre predicted by the @entity72 , the lowest yield since 1995 4 billion : the number of fewer bushels of @entity2 corn likely to be produced , compared to what was forecast at the beginning of the year 80 % : the amount of @entity2 agricultural land being affected by the current drought 65 % : the level of @entity2 cattle production being affected by the current drought sources : @entity85 , @entity2 @entity72 , @entity86 , @entity2 @entity87			1

the @entity9 lasted for 8 years , causing millions to leave their homes
an estimated 20 million hectares of farmland were *ineffective* annually
the current drought is affecting all but a *handful* of @entity2 states
4 billion fewer bushels of corn will be produced this year than once expected
