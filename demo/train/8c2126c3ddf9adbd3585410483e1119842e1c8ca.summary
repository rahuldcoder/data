they are unlikely internet celebrities : two bald eagles tending their young on the campus of @entity4 in @entity5			1
but there 's no denying that they 've become an online sensation			1
thousands of people tuned in last weekend to watch as two tiny eaglets emerged from their carefully - guarded eggs , thanks to a live streaming @entity14 installed by the school			1
since then , online viewers have been able to watch @entity17 dutifully warming her hatchlings while @entity19 works around the clock to hunt and bring back food			1
the birds have been featured on tv news broadcasts and been the subject of national and international stories			1
they even have their own @entity28 and @entity29 pages			1
" people are personally invested , " said @entity30 , director of news and editorial services at @entity4			1
" you have this ' @entity35 ' - like experience			1
people want to be part of it and say they saw it happen			1
@entity41 , they are so beautiful			1
" the eagle pair first appeared on the main campus of @entity4 in spring 2012 , nesting in a 100 - foot pine tree between the main entrance and the athletic center			1
soon , cameras were installed : one on the approach to the tree and two infrared cameras with direct views into the nest			2
" when it was discovered , we were really excited about it , " @entity30 said			2
" animal science is one of our most popular majors , so there were a lot of very curious people			2
we figured we 'd put up the camera and we 'd be able to sell our story as well			2
we had no idea it would be this popular			2
the first year we put it up , we had to move it because we could n't handle the traffic ; it almost crashed our server			2
" @entity30 said there have been over 20 million views since the livestream was set up last year			2
but interest spiked significantly last week , as the projected " hatch date " for the eggs approached			1
" we 've gotten calls from all over the world , " she said			2
" handling them has become a full - time job in and of itself			0
after the @entity87 , the second largest number of people following us is in @entity88			0
" however , the livestream has revealed aspects of life in the wild that are uncomfortable for some viewers			0
the winter storm that just moved through the region prompted a flurry of worried posts			0
even more distressing for some has been the behavior of the larger hatchling			0
it will peck at its smaller sibling and prevent it from eating -- behavior that has generated a huge amount of commentary online			1
but school officials point out that this natural behavior for eaglets			0
" it 's very common when there is more than one sibling for one to dominate , " @entity30 said			0
" this is natural , and we do n't interfere			0
this is a way to educate people about the natural world			0
" still , @entity30 understands why it can be difficult to watch this behavior			0
" the struggle with the nest and the temperatures , humans identify with that , " she said			0
" we take care of our children and our homes			0
it 's easy to get attached			0
" the eagles bring thousands of visitors to the campus of @entity4			1
@entity30 said exact numbers are hard to come by , but she estimates that 5,000 people come for a glimpse of the eagles every year			1
the college is pleased with all of the attention			0
" one of the wonderful takeaways is that it has brought to light the resurgence of eagles , " @entity30 said			1
" they were endangered , and now they are coming back from the brink			0
" if you 'd like to watch for yourself , the live stream can be found here .			0
