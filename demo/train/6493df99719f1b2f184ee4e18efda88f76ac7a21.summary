@entity0 -- president @entity2 sought to reassure and inspire @entity3 reeling from the deadly marathon bombing , telling them that @entity6 stood with their grieving city and promised : " we 'll keep going			1
we will finish the race			0
" with @entity11 packed with first responders , families of victims , political luminaries past and present , and members of the public , @entity2 called thursday 's interfaith service a chance to " mourn and measure our loss			1
" standing at the podium , he said the bombing , being investigated as a terrorist act , was personal for millions of @entity6 who , in a myriad of ways , identify with the @entity27			1
" every one of us stands with you , " he said			0
" @entity30 may be your hometown -- but we claim it , too			0
" injecting the experiences of he and his wife , @entity33 , as law students just across the @entity35 at @entity36 and as a rising political figure at the 2004 @entity39 convention , @entity2 said @entity30 's spirit remains " undaunted and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed			1
" the moment is something @entity2 , like other presidents before him , has become familiar with in the wake of national tragedy			1
among disasters on @entity2 's watch : a tornado in @entity52 , @entity53 , and mass shootings at @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 , and last december 's school massacre in @entity62 , @entity63			1
consoler - in - chief is a role modern presidents have become accustomed to filling , said @entity67 , a @entity68 historian and @entity1 contributor			1
" it 's an important role for presidents , " @entity67 said			0
" part of what the country wants is a figure who gets us through a particular crisis			0
" @entity2 's appearance at @entity30 's main @entity80 and visits with some of those injured at hospitals was an inflection point between the tragic chaos of three days ago and the intensifying investigation , which entered a new phase on thursday with the release of a video by authorities showing two men they call suspects			1
" we come together to pray and mourn and measure our loss , " @entity2 said			2
" but we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace -- to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed			0
" the service was attended by @entity100 , @entity2 's @entity101 rival in last year 's election and a former @entity104 governor and a @entity30 - based business executive			1
" i thought the president gave a superb address to the people of this city and the state and the nation , " @entity100 said			2
" it was an inspiring day			0
" @entity2 's tone on thursday was markedly different from the day before when he invoked the memory of mass shooting victims following a setback in the @entity117 for gun control priorities he supported			1
he called that legislative outcome " a pretty shameful day in @entity0			0
" @entity2 has been frustrated many times on the legislative front since taking office in 2009 , but it has never hampered his ability to communicate to the public that he is in control , @entity67 said			2
" there 's a little bit of a preacher in him and that 's something that has always drawn some people to him , " @entity67 said			2
" it gets more powerful and poignant as the speech goes forward			0
" and as he has on previous occasions when tasked with rallying mourners , @entity2 vowed that the nation 's spirit remains undaunted			1
" of that i have no doubt , you will run again , " @entity2 said to applause in @entity30 as he projected optimism			2
" you will run again , because that 's what the people of @entity30 are made of			0
" " we 'll keep going			0
we will finish the race			0
