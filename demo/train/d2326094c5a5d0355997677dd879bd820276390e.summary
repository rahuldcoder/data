what 's extraordinary is that these scenes played out saturday in a courtroom in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the case is being hailed by women 's rights groups and activists as a watershed moment , in a country where women are still the targets of violence , despite reforms since the fall of the @entity25 in 2001			1
" this case shows the level of cruelty that children in @entity14 face , " said @entity26 , an @entity14 researcher with @entity27			1
" this is not an isolated case			0
" what 's unusual about this case is that the victim had the courage to step forward , said @entity36 , program director for @entity38 , or @entity38 , an international women 's rights organization helping with the case			1
" it makes us believe and trust more in the justice system in the country , " @entity36 said , speaking to @entity0 by phone from @entity13			1
" a little young girl from a far province gets justice for herself , this is amazing			2
this is a success for human rights in the country "			2
a hateful crime the rape occurred in may , in the girl 's village in @entity56 , in northern @entity14 , according to media reports			1
the group sheltered the victim and helped her family navigate the legal process			0
this is their account of what happened : the perpetrator , mullah @entity64 , was a local mullah who taught the girls religious studies			0
one day in may , the mullah asked three girls to stay behind after classes to help clean the mosque			2
when they were about to leave , he asked the victim to stay			0
he then tied her hands , taped her mouth and raped her			2
she went home and was later examined by a doctor , who confirmed the rape			0
the police were informed and the mullah was arrested			0
the girl stayed at the @entity38 women 's shelter for a few days and was then sent to @entity13 for treatment			1
@entity64 was prosecuted under the elimination of @entity85 law , passed in 2009			0
while the law has been on the books for the past few years , it had not been strongly implemented , @entity86 , country director for @entity38 , told @entity0 from @entity13			1
" to seek justice for these cases is unusual			0
they are normally not reported ; even if they are reported they are not followed up			0
the women do n't want to bring shame to their family			2
some are not aware of the law ; others do n't trust the government			0
" @entity101 , a senior researcher on @entity14 at @entity102 , agreed that it is uncommon for rape cases to get this far			1

" most women would be afraid			2

dramatic courtroom testimony on saturday , the victim showed up at the @entity13 courtroom accompanied by her father and uncle , said @entity36 , who attended the proceedings in @entity13			1
the trial lasted nearly two hours , she said			2
the mullah sat on the floor , shackled with chains attached to handcuffs , @entity36 said , while his young victim kept her face covered with a scarf			0
she wept most of the time , @entity36 said			0
the trial began with the mullah 's two defense attorneys reading his statement given to police after his arrest , in which the cleric admitted to having sex with the girl			1
the lawyers tried to persuade the court that the sex was consensual and that he should be given only 100 lashes as punishment , @entity36 said			0
judge @entity144 rejected that argument because it would mean lashing the girl too and treating her as an adulterer rather than a rape victim , according to news reports			1
when @entity64 , speaking in his own defense , said the victim had seduced him , the girl reacted strongly			2
" you are a liar ... i never loved you ... you forced me to do this , you ruined my life ... @entity158 will hate you for what you did to me , he will punish you , " @entity36 said , paraphrasing the victim			0
the girl 's father also spoke up in the court , saying he trusted his daughter and that she never lied , @entity36 said			1
" the welcome step in this case is that the judge did not charge the child , " said @entity101			0
" in a country where there are several women and girls imprisoned for moral crimes , that 's a positive			1
" the court sentenced the mullah to the maximum 20 - year sentence			1
@entity64 's lawyers are expected to appeal to try to reduce the sentence			0
victim still traumatized the victim is still very traumatized and emotionally fragile , said @entity86 , who met the girl sunday			0
" she 's a very shy girl ; she does not talk much , but when you ask her about the case she starts to cry , " @entity86 said			1
in an interview with @entity14 's @entity186 news agency , her father , who is deaf , said he hopes the sentencing would dissuade other perpetrators from committing such crimes in the future			1
" justice should be preserved so others will send their children to mosques , " he told @entity186			0
" when family and victims raise their voice it is unusual , but luckily more and more families are speaking out , " said @entity27 's @entity26 , who credits the hard work of women 's rights groups for the legal victory			1
" to some extent this is a victory , but we still have a long way to go			0
