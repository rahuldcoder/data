-- @entity1 is famed for fashion , food and , of course , history			1
in fact , @entity1 has the highest number of @entity8 of any country in the world			2
as other social needs have taken priority in economically turbulent times , however , the country 's budget for maintaining and restoring some of its greatest tourist attractions has been drastically reduced			2
while the @entity1 @entity18 said it could n't supply statistics , as much as a third of culture budgets ( € 1.42 billion / $ 1.83 billion ) have been cut over the past three years , according to a september 2012 report in @entity23			2
restoration of historic monuments has instead been left largely to the generosity of private donors			2
step forward @entity1 fashion industry			1
over the past two years , several @entity1 fashion brands have pledged substantial amounts of money for the restoration of well known heritage sites			1
in 2011 , luxury leather goods company @entity34 pledged € 25 million ( $ 32 million ) toward the restoration of the @entity37			1
in may 2013 , @entity38 agreed to restore the @entity39 in @entity40 to the tune of € 5 million ( $ 6.4 million )			1
in @entity45 , @entity44 , cashmere brand @entity42 is helping to restore the town that it 's based in , one building at a time			2
the @entity48 , the brand 's charitable art branch , has helped restore the @entity40 palazzo @entity51 for use as an exhibition space			2
the latest to pledge funds is @entity56			1
the maker of high - end leather handbags has pledged € 2.5 million ( $ 3.2 million ) for the restoration of @entity60 , as well as @entity61 , both in @entity62			0
@entity56 to finance @entity60 makeover what brands get back in addition to the pr value of maintaining a heritage site , some brands also gain substantial marketing advantages			1
during the restoration of @entity60 , @entity56 will be allowed to display its logo at the site			1
a plaque dedicated to the brand will be displayed at the site for four years after completion of the restoration			0
diesel is reportedly allowed to place advertising billboards over a part of the @entity39 during that restoration			0
advertisements on some of their most cherished monuments do n't seem to bother locals			0
" if someone or a company is spending money to renovate a public building , which will be covered in scaffolding , green netting or white sheeting anyway , why should n't they be allowed to brand their contribution ? " says @entity85 of @entity86 , speaking about the @entity39 renovations			0
" it is a temporary situation and renovation and restoration requires a huge amount of financing and should n't this investment be recognized ? funding large scale projects via the private sector is a way to protect the future of the cultural monuments in @entity1			1
" " we were delighted to learn of @entity38 's generosity in contributing to the restoration of the @entity39 , " said @entity109 , environmental scientist , activist and co-founder of weareherevenice , an organization that seeks to preserve @entity40 's unique heritage			1
" each time i walk over it , i notice another facet of the incredible construction and it is an eternal reminder of the ingeniousness of @entity40 architects and craftsmanship			0
it is also appropriate that the shop benefiting from a strategic position at the foot of the bridge is contributing to safeguarding the heritage of the city that brings it so many customers			0
" 12 alternative @entity1 destinations private donation scandals the marriage of corporate donors and restoration projects is n't always so warm			1
in 2011 , the @entity139 - based @entity138 reported that the @entity140 of @entity141 in @entity142 signed a contract in 2009 with restoration firm @entity144 that allowed the firm to sell advertising space on its scaffolding in exchange for free restoration work			0
while @entity153 profited with € 3 million ( $ 3.8 million ) in advertising revenue , none of the contracted restoration work was done			0
the article cited similar cases in at least 22 other @entity1 cities			2
there are , of course , alternative sources of funding			0
according to the @entity1 @entity163 , some restoration projects are funded by the @entity1 @entity164			1
private charitable trusts such as @entity40 in @entity166 have raised funds in partnership with restaurant chain @entity169 to support restoration projects			0
for now , however , cash infusions from big brands , with commercial images strongly tied to their @entity1 roots , seem to be just the prescription for the problems ailing various monuments			1
especially with traditional entities of public maintenance lacking the necessary resources			0
" the city administration is being remarkably inefficient in managing @entity40 and should not be allowed to become too reliant on the private sector to mop up the mess of its own messy housekeeping , " says activist @entity181			0
for now , though , most locals seem happy that at least someone is around to clean up the mess , even if it means identifying history with commercial promotion .			0
