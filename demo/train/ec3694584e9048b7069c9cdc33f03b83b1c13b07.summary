@entity0 began voting sunday in parliamentary elections described by prime minister @entity2 as a referendum on his flagship economic policies			1
@entity2 called for the snap election last month , following news that the country had unexpectedly slipped into recession , dealing a blow to his much - vaunted " @entity10 " -- the stimulus and economic reform package he introduced since taking power in 2012			1
" the election will be held to ask the public whether we will ( move ) forward with @entity10 or end it , " @entity2 said when announcing the closure of parliament in november			1
recent polls have shown that @entity2 's @entity21 has a strong lead over the main opposition party but turnout is expected to be low			2
strange timing an election was n't required until late 2016 , which has led to considerable speculation as to why @entity2 , with a sizable majority in the lower house -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early			2
@entity34 @entity33 , analyst and founder of @entity36 , a @entity37 - based government policy consultancy , said he found the timing " puzzling			0
" " why call an election when you have such a dominant position ? " indeed , polls suggest that a majority of the public do n't understand why @entity2 is calling an election at this time , and are critical of the decision to incur the cost during another period of recession			1
voter turnout is expected to be low			0
polls put support for the ruling ( @entity21 ) at around 30 % , with between 10 % and 13 % support for the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , the main opposition party			0
the @entity21 has been in power nearly constantly since 1955			0
during this period , the @entity53 have only governed twice , briefly in the 1990s and again from 2009 to 2012			0

while a key component of @entity10 has been extra government spending , a sales tax hike this year and rising costs have taken their toll on small businesses and their customers			1
in a bit to boost his election fortunes , @entity2 delayed a sales tax hike planned for october 2015			2
his special adviser on economic affairs , @entity77 , has called for a further $ 25 billion in cash handouts and tax cuts to kickstart the economy			0
but it 's not clear whether this will be enough to satisfy voters			0
" @entity10 is no good at all , " said @entity84 , the fourth - generation owner of a 100 year - old tofu shop owner in @entity37 , who is finding recent economic conditions a threat to his livelihood			2
" our life is getting tough			0
