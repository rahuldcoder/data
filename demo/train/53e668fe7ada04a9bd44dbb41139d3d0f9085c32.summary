along with @entity191 , it has a significant @entity193 minority , which has been restive in recent years , and an @entity196 population			0

" it is an explosive brew			0
even if the government can contain violence to @entity21 for the time - being , protests will spread			2
the wall of fear has broken			0
apathy of the young has turned to anger , " because there are so few sources available from what has been a closed , authoritarian society , human rights activists are trying to get a handle on the number of casualties and the context behind the unrest in @entity21 , which is a more conservative , tribal and close - knit community			0
@entity270 said it has been " deeply disturbed by reports of multiple deaths " in @entity21 , as security forces fired " at protesters and people coming to the aid of the injured			0
