when @entity1 arrived at the @entity2 in the fall of 1945 , he was nervous			1
he landed at @entity2 by way of the @entity6 's v - 12 program , a wartime measure that allowed young men to take college classes , receive naval training and preparation to become officers			1
@entity1 was black , but university officials did not know that			1
he had a white complexion and wavy brown hair			0
a military official checked the " @entity20 " box for white when @entity1 enlisted in the @entity6			1
this official unwittingly set @entity1 on an entirely new path			2
@entity1 explained that he had no intention to " pass , " and once at @entity2 in @entity25 , no one inquired about his race			1
" i guess they just assumed i was white , " @entity1 said			1
if no one asked , why tell ? passing -- the choice to leave behind a black racial identity and present oneself as white -- allowed many african - americans to navigate a racist society			1
in today 's multiracial @entity35 , the decision to pass may seem unnecessary and unwarranted			0
but historically , erasing one 's black identity was one of a limited number of avenues available to light - skinned @entity32 to secure a better life in the era of legalized segregation			2
those who passed often reaped financial rewards , gained social privileges and enjoyed the fun of " getting over " by playing a practical joke on unsuspecting whites and winning a clandestine war against @entity35			0
@entity1 settled into campus life with ease			0
he was accepted as " just another student			0
" he wore the college 's colors as a member of the track team , made close friends with white students , danced with and dated white women and ate at local restaurants without incident			0
he was active on campus			0
described by one classmate as " arrogant " and " a loud talker , " he even participated in a protest against sen. @entity67 , the fanatical segregationist , when he spoke at @entity2 while @entity1 was on campus			1
when the military ended the v - 12 program , @entity1 transferred to @entity71 in his hometown of @entity73			1
@entity2 officials at @entity2 never questioned why one of their ostensibly white students had made plans to attend a historically black college			1
@entity1 's white skin functioned as a cloak and allowed him to pass as white at the @entity2			1
but when @entity82 , another black student , attempted to integrate @entity2 in 1962 , it ignited widespread riots across the campus			2
@entity2 prided itself on 114 years as a lily - white institution			1
@entity1 observed the violent resistance to integration and declared , " they 're fighting a battle they do n't know they lost years ago			1
" once at @entity71 , @entity1 returned to life as a black man			2
he later entered the printing business and moved to @entity95			0
@entity1 told his story to the press and gave readers a rare and intimate look at the lived experience of passing			2
but he was not the only @entity32 enlisted man whose military records identified him as " white " or " @entity104			0
" this type of temporary passing flourished during the @entity108 era			0
@entity1 's story appears to be one of levity and laughter , of exposing the absurdity of racial categories , and poking fun at erroneous beliefs in racial purity and white supremacy			1
but his story ends in tragedy			0
@entity1 committed suicide at 63 in @entity95 in 1991			0
we will never know why he took his own life			0
there is no evidence to link @entity1 's death to any conflict that he may have had about his racial identity			2
but still , his suicide leads us to wonder about the personal and psychological losses , in addition to the gains , associated with passing			0
the history of passing offers a richer understanding of lives lived along the color line			2
but this history is never complete			0
it remains shadowy and blurred			1
was there ever a time people assumed you were something that you were not ? share your experiences in the comments , on @entity146 or on @entity148 's facebook page .			0

@entity1 attended the @entity2 in 1945 - 46
@entity1 " passed " -- he was black , but people thought he was white
more than *15* years years later , racial integration drew huge protest at @entity2
the history of passing remains shadowy , but offers *lessons* , @entity*15*6 *writes*
