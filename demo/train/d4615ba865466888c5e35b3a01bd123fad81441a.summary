@entity0 -- @entity1 's @entity2 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday on " @entity5 " to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			1
some late chess moves in @entity10 races , a rush to lawyer up , and some early vote tallies that suggest @entity15 struggles -- those were part of our trip around the " @entity5 " table to close our sunday conversation			1
the candidates give way to the voters -- and then the lawyers eight or nine @entity26 races are dead heats entering the final week , so can you predict with any certainty who will win ? yes : the lawyers will			2
@entity33 's @entity32 shared reporting that both parties , even as they make late spending and schedule decisions in the big races , are also looking past @entity38 to the likelihood that so many close races will mean recounts and runoffs -- and therefore a need for legal teams			2
" here in @entity0 , both the party committees are already talking to lawyers on the ground			0
they are already planning to send people into those close states -- like potentially @entity51 or @entity52 or @entity53 -- if they go down to the wire , to have people ready to fight , because this is an @entity38 that could last for potentially months			1
early voting is @entity15 ' ace in the hole -- until it is n't @entity38 is n't what it used to be			1
with more and more states adopting more liberal early and absentee voting rules , some of the closest races this year will actually be settled before poll closings a week from tuesday			2
and throughout @entity67 , @entity15 have told us that it is their not - so - secret weapon			0
as they see it , they won that battle in 2008 and 2012 and have the nuts - and - bolts infrastructure in place in the states where it could make a big difference in 2014			0
@entity52 and @entity53 , for example			1
maybe @entity79 and @entity80 , too			0
but the @entity82 's @entity81 says the numbers , so far anyway , do n't appear to be adding up the way the @entity15 had hoped			0
" this past week , for the first time in history , @entity86 returned more early votes than @entity15 in @entity53 , " said ball			1
" this is a big danger sign			0
now @entity15 are saying : ' oh , those are just those people who would have voted on @entity38 anyway			0
' " but she notes that in the past two elections , the @entity86 has won @entity38 voting in @entity53 by more than 9 percentage points , so for @entity86 to also be leading in the early vote should be a warning to @entity15 about what might happen on november 4			1
the 2014 race with the most personal 2016 implications gov. @entity101 of @entity102 is a conservative favorite and could be a formidable @entity86 presidential contender			1
former gov. @entity101 -- well , not so much			1
so winning his tough 2014 re-election campaign is priority no. 1 for @entity101 , and @entity107 of the @entity108 took a few moments to share his reporting about what could be the cycle 's marquee gubernatorial race			1
" this week you 're going to see president @entity115 go to @entity116 , " said @entity107			1
" @entity15 really think they have an opportunity there , if they can get the turnout in the state 's biggest city , to put a @entity122 , @entity123 , over the top and take out one of the top candidates for the @entity86 in the next cycle			2
the war for women : democrats looking to widen the gender gap @entity15 readily concede a giant gender gap is imperative if they are to win the big @entity26 races this year			0
just look at @entity135 's weekend appeal for @entity15 sen. @entity136 in @entity80			0
so @entity138 's @entity137 says gender politics -- and the war for women 's votes -- are her big focus in the final full week of the midterm campaign			0
" i saw this interesting poll last month that shows most women prefer a @entity86 - controlled @entity10 to a @entity15 - controlled @entity10 , " said @entity137			2
" i 'll watch that trend in close states like in @entity52 , where certainly reproductive choice issues and women have been a battleground , and in @entity53 of course , while also looking to see whether or not @entity86 are able to close the diversity gap in the @entity10			1
and i think that will be a very important story as we are moving ahead to look forward to in 2016 as well			0
the margin matters : plenty of late @entity10 chess even most democrats concede @entity86 are likely to add to their @entity10 majority this year , but there 's a big debate about how many seats are in play , and some fascinating final week chess being played			2
democrats are mostly playing defense -- feeling better , for example , about two @entity15 seats in @entity79 that remain competitive to the end			0
on the flip side , any seats @entity15 can take away from @entity86 would offset losses elsewhere ; it 's considered a bit of a long shot , but some @entity15 believe they have a shot at one in the @entity178 suburbs , if @entity15 can meet their early voting targets			1
republicans currently control 233 seats			0
@entity15 want to keep them below 240 ; @entity86 hopes are to get to 245 or more			2
two @entity15 - held seats where @entity186 forces are making a late spending push : the 6th @entity188 in @entity189 and the 26th in @entity190 .			0

lawyering up for potential runoff contests in @entity193 and @entity194
november 4 tea leaves -- @entity86 ahead in the @entity53 early vote tally
@entity115 goes to @entity102 to help dems try to *unseat* @entity101
