@entity0 -- @entity2 is one of the @entity5 language 's best - known and most - loved writers			1
celebrate the 200th anniversary of her most popular book , " @entity8 , " with a tour of some of the key locations in her life and works -- and in the big - screen adaptations they inspired			1
film and tv locations the location every " @entity8 " fan wants to visit is , of course , @entity20 -- " a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills , " as @entity2 describes it			1
just where to look for the house and grounds ( and whether you 're also looking for that all important lake , of course ) depends which adaptation you favor : the 1995 tv version was filmed at @entity34 in @entity35 ( exterior scenes ) , and @entity37 in @entity38 ( interior scenes )			0
for many readers and viewers , the house which best corresponds to the @entity20 of their imagination is @entity45 , in @entity38			0
@entity8 turns 200 in the 2005 film , it is @entity48 that is referring to when she jokes that her love for @entity51 dates from her " first seeing his grounds at @entity20 , " but @entity2 expert @entity54 , of @entity56 's @entity55 , says this is a mistake			1
" the great houses we see in the tv and film versions of ' @entity8 ' are too great , " she insists , arguing that by imagining the action of @entity2 's novels taking place in such grand houses , we change their tone			1
" @entity51 is not the @entity68 [ the owner of @entity45 ] ; the owner of @entity45 would not be seen at the @entity71			0
@entity2 's stories are those of the middle class , the gentry , and not the upper class , the aristocracy			1
" other locations to feature in the 2005 film include @entity78 , and the village of @entity80 in @entity81 ; @entity82 in @entity38 ( which also features in three versions of " @entity85 , " " @entity86 " and " @entity87 " ) ; and @entity88 in @entity89 ( which also has links to @entity91 , and @entity92 ) which doubles for the @entity95 ' home , @entity96			0
in the 1995 adaptation , the village of @entity98 in @entity99 stands in for @entity101 , while nearby @entity103 , in the @entity102 , plays the part of @entity96 ; scenes at @entity106 , the imposing stately home of @entity108 , were shot at @entity109 in @entity81			0
@entity110 @entity110 is the city perhaps most closely associated with @entity2 ; it features prominently in two of her novels ( ' @entity115 ' and ' persuasion ' ) , and she lived here with her family from 1801 to 1806			2
in the @entity120 era , it was a fashionable spa town , where the well - to - do came to ' take the waters ' -- and to see and be seen , at the @entity124 , the @entity125 , and the theater			0
today , much of the city 's @entity120 architecture remains , making it almost as popular with film and tv crews making costume dramas as it is with tourists			2
@entity2 fans can visit the @entity135 , take the waters -- and then take their taste away with tea at the @entity125 -- and wander the streets that the novelist herself walked down : @entity142 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity143 , where @entity2 lived at @entity147			2
" parts of the city look the same as they did in @entity2 's day , " explains @entity148 , of the @entity135 , " so visitors can see the same buildings she saw , get a sense of what it was like in her day , and walk in her footsteps			1
" @entity160 , the local tourism office , offers a free audio tour , " in the footsteps of @entity2 " and there is also a @entity163 of @entity165 app , guiding visitors around the city using photos , paintings , @entity170 music and quotes from her work and letters			2
@entity175 @entity2 was born and brought up in the @entity175 village of @entity177 , where her father was the local vicar			2
her birthplace , the rectory , no longer exists , but there are several memorials to @entity2 in @entity183 , including a weathervane in the shape of a pen			0
@entity2 spent the last eight years of her life at @entity188 , and it was here , in the red brick cottage where she lived with her mother and sister that she revised her earlier works for publication , and wrote " @entity197 , " " @entity198 " and " persuasion			1
" the cottage is now a museum of @entity2 's life and work , home to family portraits , manuscripts , and the table at which she wrote some of her most famous work			1
in 1817 , @entity2 became ill , and was persuaded to travel to @entity211 to be close to her doctor ; she stayed in a house in @entity216 ( now marked with a plaque ) , and died there on july 18 , 1817 , aged 41			0
she was buried in the north aisle of @entity219 ; her gravestone makes no mention of her career as a writer , instead reading : " the benevolence of her heart , the sweetness of her temper and the extraordinary endowments of her mind obtained the regard of all who knew her and the warmest love of her intimate connections			0
" a brass tablet recognizing her literary talents was added in 1872 , and her final resting place was celebrated in a poem by @entity241 : " @entity2 lies in @entity211 , blessed be her shade ! @entity243 for making her , and her for all she made			0
