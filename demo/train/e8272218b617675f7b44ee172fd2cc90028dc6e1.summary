-- @entity2 is asking an international court to weigh in on @entity5 's whale - hunting practices , officials said tuesday			1
@entity5 officials say their hunts are permitted under rules prohibit commercial whaling but allow whaling for scientific reasons			1
but @entity2 officials said they 've filed a lawsuit with the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , to stop @entity5 from exploiting the research loophole			1
" we believe that it 's possible to do all the research that you need to do and understand everything that you need to ... and you do n't have to kill them to do it , " @entity2 environment minister @entity18 told @entity0 tuesday			2
@entity5 @entity25 spokesman @entity24 said tuesday that @entity5 's whaling , which has killed up to 1,000 whales in @entity29 waters annually , is authorized			1
" @entity5 's research whaling is a legal activity , " he said , noting that the country would continue to explain its perspective in international court			1
the move toward legal action is " regrettable , " @entity24 said , when international whale - hunting rules are still being negotiated			2
the @entity38 is scheduled to evaluate existing whaling rules at its annual meeting in june			0
but @entity18 said diplomatic negotiations over the issues have not produced results			0
he stressed that taking the case to court does not mean that the relationship between @entity2 and @entity5 -- strong allies and trading partners -- has soured			2
" we think we can disagree about one thing and continue to have close relationships across a range of other issues , " he said			0
@entity5 's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups , who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants			1
@entity5 's fisheries agency has said that it wants " sustainable whaling " and also advocates conservation			1
" clearly , the acceptance of other cultures ' dietary practices and the promotion of cultural diversity is as important as saving endangered species and the promotion of biological diversity , " the agency 's website says			2
" if the consumption of whale meat does not endanger whale species , those who find the practice unacceptable for themselves should not try to impose their view on others			0
" @entity2 's lawsuit comes as an anti-whaling activist was facing charges including assault and trespassing in a @entity5 court			1
prosecutors allege that @entity92 , an environmental activist from @entity93 , threw butyric acid at a whaling ship , jumped aboard and attempted to make a citizen 's arrest of the captain			0
@entity92 has pleaded guilty to all charges accept assault			0
he testified monday that he did not intend to hurt anyone			0
a verdict is expected later this month			0
