@entity0 -- a great deal has been said about the five week long election underway in @entity4			1
the world 's largest democracy			2
814 million people going to the polls			2
a candidate representing a family dynasty versus a firebrand chief minister			0
but this race will likely boil down to three simple numbers that impact every citizen in the country : growth , inflation and interest rates			1
to be blunt , they do not favor the incumbent @entity20 which has ruled for the last decade			0
what 's at stake ? economic growth came in at only 4.5 % in the last fiscal year , the worst performance in a decade			2
we are awaiting the final tally for last year , but bets are it will be below 5 %			0
consumer inflation for february came in at a 25 - month low of 8.1 % , but that is incredibly high when the rest of the world is trying to fight off deflation , not the rising cost of food			0
with prices soaring over the past year , the relatively new but high profile central bank governor @entity40 was forced to raise interest rates three times since last september			0
the repo rate for the @entity45 stood at 8 % as @entity4 began their journey to the polls			1
whether it is on the campaign trail in the @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53 , pocketbook issues dominate			1
by the numbers : the world 's biggest exercise in democracy it is widely viewed in the @entity4 business community that the competent , but aging prime minister @entity60 lost his zeal for reform and that @entity63 committed too late in the game to express a desire to lead in a party which has run out of ideas to jumpstart growth			1
prior to the global banking crisis @entity4 was humming along , with growth of over 9 % for a handful of years			1
you probably remember when comparisons were being made about the two towers of the emerging markets , @entity76 and @entity4			1
a state - run apparatus stacked up against the sprawling democratic structure of @entity4 , with chief ministers of states controlling so much power			1
in the @entity20 era , names like @entity84 and @entity85 came to the fore			0
we understood the vibrancy and productivity of @entity91			0
and we are well aware of the rising middle class in @entity4			1
but this is an election where one should keep an eye two core voting blocks : the youth and those in the vast rural lands			2
11 things to know about the world 's biggest election @entity4 is a young country			1
nearly half are under the age of 26			0
despite the wealth creation in the past decade , about 850 million @entity4 live outside major cities and remain dependent on farming			2
according to a poll by @entity109 ahead of the vote , both these blocks favor the @entity112 party by a margin of 3 to 1			0
they think chief minister @entity115 is better positioned to cut bureaucracy , tackle corruption and revive growth			0
they were probably were led to that position by the three numbers that have clearly undermined support for the @entity20			0
more from @entity123 : why the world is watching the @entity126 markets split into tortoises and hares : which will win 2014 ?			2

@entity123 says @entity4 's election race will boil down to the economy
he says the @entity4 business community thinks @entity136 lost his zeal for reform
whether it is in the @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53 , pocketbook issues dominate , he writes
