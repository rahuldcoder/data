some call it courage , others madness			0
still others attribute it just to excessive alcohol			0
whatever their motivation , thousands of daredevils from across the globe were on the streets of @entity11 , @entity12 , on sunday testing their nerve by sprinting through the city streets in front of six huge , charging bulls			1
risking injury at the horns of a frantic , three - quarter - ton creature may not sound like everyone 's idea of a pleasant vacation			2
yet the legendary , centuries - old @entity23 in @entity11 -- part of the annual @entity25 -- has attracted more and more tourists to this small , northern @entity12 city in recent years			1
what 's the attraction ? there 's no longer a practical need to herd the bulls through the city streets to the bull ring in the center of town			2
the frenetic race is maintained because it 's fantastic publicity for @entity11 , as well as one of the world 's most memorable tests of bravery and agility			1
@entity45 and scary so , what 's your chance of injury ? not as high as the fearful - looking contest might suggest			0
on the first day of this year 's bull run , among the thousands of runners , only four were treated for injuries			1
but maybe they 're counting themselves lucky , showing off their bruises as a mark of courage			0
after all , it 's a sign they almost certainly were n't hiding in a doorway as the bulls thundered past .			0
