it 's enough to make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck			2
a sea of yellow and gold stretches as far as the eye can see			0
the streets of @entity11 are lined with adoring football fans as the team bus winds its way towards the the @entity15 for @entity17 's biggest match of the season against bitter rivals @entity19 with the prize of the @entity22 championship hanging in the balance			1
inside the stadium the famous @entity24 is alive with passion			2
as kick - off draws the cacophony of noise grows ever louder " i 've been to many , many sporting events across the world , " says @entity30 , vice president of sport and media at the @entity33 -- which is headed up by @entity17 's @entity35 owner @entity34			1
" there 's nothing i 've experienced that 's like @entity17			1
" except you 're not sat in the stands			0
you 're in your living room			0
you 're not under night sky in the " @entity11 , " you 're glaring into an @entity46 in @entity47			0
in partnership with @entity51 , @entity17 is attempting to transport the match - day experience across the globe , using the latest technology and the power of social media to attract new fans from every corner of the world			1
" in terms of exporting this beautiful brand , the passion of the fans and all that , it 's not just a world where there 's traditional media anymore , " adds @entity30 , eager to explore new horizons , @entity34 is a man as likely to be spotted in @entity70 's tech heartlands as he is dealing with football 's power brokers			1
and , with his blessing , it 's as if @entity30 has been given free reign to explore football 's final frontier			1
" we know we 're not going to win over many more fans in @entity22 , " says @entity30			2
wif you 're a @entity19 fan or an @entity83 fan , that 's who you are , that 's what you 're born into			2
" so back on the sofa , those @entity46 fans will watch a @entity90 livestream following the @entity17 team bus as it journeys to the stadium , with drones flying above the crowd to give an altogether different perspective to viewers watching the big game			1
the innovations do n't end there			0
fans will be able to view " shoeselfies , " 360 - degree photographs of the players ' boots which will be posted prior to the 2045 @entity103 kick off time			1
@entity17 's @entity107 page will also display a " photosphere , " an interactive panoramic image which allows users to further explore game night in the @entity22 capital			1
a similar project was recently conducted with @entity115 team @entity114			2
the @entity33 's involvements in sport , technology and social media , as @entity30 explains , means @entity17 is uniquely positioned to exploit new technologies			1
the private investment company has interests in the @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , among others			0
as @entity30 puts it : " i do n't think there 's many @entity130 football club owners that go to @entity132 on a regular basis			1
" it 's not the first time @entity17 and @entity51 have joined forces			1
in may 2014 , @entity138 donned @entity139 for the team 's friendly against @entity141 while the club 's iconic captain @entity142 has taken part in a fan chat in a @entity51 hangout			1
but what 's in for tech giant @entity51 ? " when people tell you there are 3.5 billion football fans in the world , as a way to engage people on our platforms , it 's certainly something for us to look at , " says @entity148 , sports partnerships manager for @entity51			1
" it 's definitely an area we 're taking a close look at			2
" no wonder @entity51 want to wiggle their way into the hearts and minds of the football fan			1
a grand total of 672 million tweets were sent relating to the @entity168 in @entity169 , while the hosts 7 - 1 thrashing by @entity172 in the semifinals saw a record 35 million tweets posted			2
like @entity51 , @entity125 wants to put itself inside the stadium			1
sunday 's @entity177 final between @entity178 and @entity179 will see @entity181 's iconic arch turn blue or white depending on which team 's hashtag proves most popular			1
" if you look across all social media platforms , there 's a huge amount of interest in football , " says @entity148			2
" people are going online to check football scores , follow their favorite players , follow their favorite clubs			0
" by bringing new tools to the table -- " bringing people closer to the game through technology , " as @entity148 puts it -- @entity51 is intent on becoming an integral part of the football landscape			1
" if you told any of us 10 years ago that any of this technology would exist , i think all of us would take pause , " he responds when asked what the future could look like for @entity51 and football			1
" i 'm 29 and we were still writing letters to our favorite players when we were growing up			0
now people are sitting in their living rooms and talking to them directly			0
" it 's a far cry from how football looked in the 1970s , the era that @entity216 , growing up in @entity215 , was first entranced by a dominant @entity218 team			1
although not from the city , @entity216 fell in love with the club in a way similar to how @entity17 hopes overseas fans will fall for the " @entity225 " ( the yellow - reds			1
) @entity216 has been involved with football and @entity218 as a fan , season ticket holder , journalist and author and has seen social media change how rival supporters interact with each other			0
and not necessarily for the better			0
rather than physically clashing on the streets , he suggests fans now trade 140 - character blows			1
" it 's about being totally neurotic about your team 's result and then being totally neurotic about what everybody else is doing , " he said			2
" you see a lot of fans tweeting about their rival 's demise and the whole schadenfreude thing			2
it 's more about other people 's misfortune			2
" with football clubs clamoring to maximize their social media presence and thus increase their corporate appeal , it 's perhaps no surprise to see the odd own goal			0
@entity260 is one of @entity218 's official sponsors and it recently incurred the wrath of the @entity125 masses when it altered the club crest as part of a pr campaign			2
it replaced the phrase " @entity269 " and the two flames which feature on the badge -- both designed to honor the 96 @entity218 fans who died at the infamous @entity274 in 1989 -- with the words " @entity277 on @entity260 ' " and two coffee cups			0
it has since apologized for the incident , which @entity216 suggests highlights the dangers of involving the glitzy world of pr and advertising with clubs that often have strong links to local communities with deep political convictions			0
" when you look at how clubs have organically grown over the years and now they 're kind of touting for new fans , you have unfortunate things , " said @entity216 , referring to the @entity260 gaffe			0
" replacing the @entity274 flames with a couple of plastic cups , they do n't know what that means			0
that 's part of the failing of the new social media thing , where not everybody knows what things stand for			0
" @entity216 also doubts whether increasing a club 's social media popularity necessarily translate into creating true football fans			1
" i just do n't know how much of the true club can come across on social media , " he says			0
" everything on social media has to be bland and inoffensive			0
" @entity216 readily accepts that , as a traditional fan brought up in a bygone age , he 's not necessarily the target audience for the latest technological innovations			0
but he doubts whether or not " shoeselfies " and drones can inspire true passion in the heart of an overseas follower			0
" it 's a whole new style of fan that 's coming through because of the technology , because of the access			0
i do n't know whether social media is part of gaining true fans or just gaining ' likes ' on @entity328			0
my sense is that it 's all pretty dull			0
" @entity51 and @entity17 will be hoping that the football fans of tomorrow disagree			1
after all , 3.5 billion people is a lot of eyeballs .			0

@entity51 and @entity17 partner to offer fans worldwide a *digital* match - day experience
a live stream of the team bus and drone *cameras* over the stadium will offer viewers a unique insight
the club will *publish* gifs of 360 - degree " shoeselfies " on its @entity107 page
@entity181 's arch will light up with the *colors* of @entity178 or @entity179 during @entity177 final
