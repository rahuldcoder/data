@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 leader @entity3 was appointed as @entity6 prime minister on tuesday following the resignation of @entity8 , whose @entity9 was defeated in thursday 's general election			1
@entity3 traveled to @entity11 where he was invited to form a government by @entity13			1
so what will happen in the near future ? when does @entity3 take office ? @entity3 arrived at the prime minister 's official @entity18 residence early wednesday morning to begin work on agreeing the final details of his coalition government with the @entity23			1
@entity8 left the building for the last time on tuesday evening			0
full election coverage how will the next government work ? the @entity4 won 306 seats in the election , which is 20 seats short of a parliamentary majority , so it needs the cooperation of other , smaller parties , especially on contentious legislation			2
on tuesday the center - right party agreed a deal to govern in coalition with the centrist @entity23 to form a " strong and stable " administration			1
this will give it a notional majority of 86 if all @entity4 and @entity41 vote with the government			2
who will be in the government ? @entity45 and other leading @entity23 look to be the big winners from the coalition deal with @entity45 appointed deputy prime minister , although it remains unclear exactly what brief that role will entail			1
the @entity23 are expected to hold five ministerial posts in the @entity53			2
but the @entity4 hold on to two senior offices of state , with @entity56 named @entity57 , or finance minister , and @entity59 appointed foreign secretary			1
what is the agenda of the new government ? the government is expected to unveil an emergency budget within weeks as the @entity6 continues to recover from the economic crisis			2
@entity3 said reducing the huge budget deficit was his priority along with tackling the social problems that @entity6 faced			1
the @entity23 favored delaying public spending cuts while the economic recovery remained fragile			2
but both parties have been forced to compromise on key policies in reaching a deal to work together			0
the @entity4 have pledged £ 6 billion ( $ 9 billion ) in spending cuts this year			2
they will also scrap a planned increase in national insurance contributions -- a form of tax funding healthcare and welfare benefits -- paid by employers which they said would damage the economy			0
but the @entity23 have achieved a concession that will see the personal tax threshold raised to £ 10,000 ( $ 15,000 ) -- a key manifesto pledge they say will benefit lower - paid workers			0
@entity23 demands for electoral reform have been partially accommodated with the government pledging a referendum on moving to an " @entity94 " system			0
but the @entity23 have dropped for now their opposition to the replacement of the @entity6 's @entity98 independent nuclear deterrent			1
what are the potential stumbling blocks ? the conservatives and the @entity23 have very different policies on @entity103 , the @entity6 's nuclear deterrent , immigration and , crucially , electoral reform			1
will a coalition impede the workings of government and will it make it more difficult to get laws passed ? there is no reason why a coalition government should necessarily work any differently to one formed by a single party			0
the party leaders will need to agree on the government 's agenda , laid out in the @entity120 later this month			0
how effective the government is in passing new laws depends on lawmakers in both parties of course			0
if @entity23 are rebellious they will vote against the government , and if they bring it down , by forcing a no - confidence motion , they risk sparking another general election			0
is a second general election likely ? @entity3 has the right to call a new election at any time ; he may do so if he feels in a strong enough position and if he feels the @entity23 are not allowing him to pursue his agenda			1
who is the opposition ? the @entity9 is now in opposition along with other smaller parties , and its deputy leader @entity141 will be interim leader as well as leader of the opposition following @entity8 's resignation as @entity9 leader earlier in the week			0
do officials in @entity18 remain in their jobs ? members of the @entity148 are non-partisan , and work with a government formed by any party			0
the civil servants thus remain in their posts , and help with the transition of the new government			0
how often does @entity6 have coalition governments ? they are very rare in @entity6 politics			1
the last time @entity6 had a hung parliament was in february 1974 , when @entity160 's conservatives gained more votes but fewer seats in @entity163 than @entity9			0
unable to form a deal with the @entity165 , the @entity4 stayed on in a minority government , but found themselves back at the polls by october			1
the last coalition to rule the @entity6 was formed in response to the crisis of @entity171 , with conservative @entity172 leading an all - party administration between 1940 and 1945 .			2
