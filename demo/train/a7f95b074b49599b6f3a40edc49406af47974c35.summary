what would you do if you went to the library in search of " @entity12 " for your child , or to re-read @entity6 's @entity5 - winning novel " @entity7 " only to find that the book had been pulled from the shelves because another patron objected to its content ? it happens in the @entity15 more often than many realize			2
at least 464 formal complaints were filed in 2012 seeking to remove books from libraries or schools , according to the @entity21 , a sponsor of @entity22 , which runs september 22 - 28			1
its mission is to celebrate the freedom to read and highlight the pitfalls of censorship			2
modern children 's books help families explore diversity the annual event started in 1982 , the same year the @entity32 ruled that students ' first amendment rights were violated when @entity38 's " @entity37 " and eight other books were removed from school libraries			1
despite the legal precedent , schools and libraries still receive formal challenges to remove books from library shelves or nix them from reading lists to protect children from material some see as inappropriate			1
just this month , a @entity50 school board voted to ban @entity52 's " @entity51 " based on complaints from the parent of an 11th - grader			1
the board is reportedly scheduled to reconsider its decision			2
the targets of challenges have changed over the years , but the reasons remain fairly constant , said @entity61 , the @entity21 's deputy director of the @entity62			1
" sexually explicit content and offensive language continue to be the main reasons , " she said			1
the @entity62 compiles lists of attempts to ban books in libraries and schools based on media reports and reports filed directly with the office , which means it documents only the complaints brought to its attention			1
for each challenge recorded , the @entity21 estimates there are four to five more that go unreported			1
for similar reasons it 's also hard to pin down exactly how many challenges succeed			1
a book might be pulled without the public 's knowledge , or a ban might be overturned when appealed by teachers , parents and students			2
books from @entity92 's " @entity95 " series , which chronicles the adventures of two fourth - grade pranksters , were the most frequently challenged books in 2012 , along with acclaimed bestsellers " beloved , " by @entity6 , " @entity97 " by @entity98 and " @entity99 " by @entity100			1
' @entity101 ' : a boy , a bird and bullies most of the titles were making repeat appearances at the top of the list , owing to what @entity61 calls the " viral " nature of book challenges : a book is the target of a ban in one community , then someone from another community hears about it and makes his or her own challenge			1
so what do authors do when their books are targeted ? we spoke to two authors whose books made the most - challenged list in 2012			1
a children 's book ' we could stand behind ' @entity130 is the co-author of " @entity131 , " a children 's book about @entity134 , a pair of male penguins who successfully hatched an egg at @entity140 's @entity139			2
" @entity131 " was the fifth most frequently challenged book in 2012 , the @entity21 reported			1
on whether @entity130 thought " @entity131 " would be controversial : " we did anticipate that there would be objections from some corners to our book			2
we never anticipated that we would become [ one of ] the most challenged book five years in a row			1
" on how it changed the way they wrote the book : " it encouraged us to write a book that we could stand behind			2
we chose our words very carefully in writing this book , and in part we chose them carefully because we knew there was a possibility that it would be challenged " for example , there 's no anthropomorphisation in the book , we never said @entity134 felt a certain way because we did not want to attribute anything to the penguins in the order of a human intention because that 's something that could very easily be criticized , and fairly so , as reading our own agenda into the penguins ' actions			1
that was one way the book was shaped in anticipation of criticism			2
" at the same time , you do n't write books for critics , you write it for people who will benefit from it and enjoy it			1
ultimately there will be many more of those people than critics			2
we were writing for young children who had families like those in the book			2
we also felt it was important to have our facts straight because one of the points people defending the book observed is that this is actually a true story			2
we visited the penguins and interviewed zookeepers and vetted it with @entity139 to make sure we were n't misstating the true events			2
" on how he and his co-author responded to attempts to ban the book : " every challenge is different			2
the first challenge that we heard of was the most disturbing , and that was because of the way it was handled			2
" a librarian had received a challenge about the book , and her response was to take the book out of the fiction section and place it into the nonfiction section because that section was much less frequently browsed			1
naturally , we were extremely displeased and wrote a letter of complaint to the newsletter of the @entity21			1
" very shortly after that , or maybe as result of that event , librarians across the country and organizations who saw it as their charter to defend books got on the issue , and we were lucky to be championed by them , including the @entity21 , the @entity62 , @entity231 , and numerous local affiliates of the @entity233			1
when you know you have those organizations behind you and the @entity240 in your corner , all of those challenges become less upsetting			1
" we 've dealt with them in a number of different ways , but our preference is to let organizations and folks on the ground in the community to do their work so there 's a local solution to the challenge			0
it 's far better than having two @entity140 authors call up a town and say ' hey you 're violating the @entity240			0
' we 'd rather have a group of parents go to a board meeting and work this out			0
however , when a librarian has worked particularly courageously we 'll send an e-mail to support her			0
" we 've written school board members and let them know that there is a precedent and @entity32 ruling on the subject			0
in each case where there 's an open challenge , a school will go through the process where they appoint a committee or take it to the school board to investigate what the actions should be			0
you could look at them negatively and say there 's a certain amount of reinventing the wheel because the legal precedent is quite clear			0
at the same time , allowing the school community to go through the process of figuring that out and debating it i think has an unquestionable value , and that 's one reason we like to leave it to them			0
" on how it affected his views on censorship : " it 's strengthened my appreciation for the importance of protecting the freedom to read			0
" i think we handle [ public challenges ] to books pretty well as a country			1
but i think there 's a greater problem which is secret challenges to books and soft bans ; when a school official objects to a book and checks it out and fails to return it , or when a school librarian reads news about a particular book and is afraid to order it for the library			1
that self - censorship is something that i do n't believe we have an answer to			0
" a novel that ' needed to feel uncomfortable ' @entity324 is the author of " @entity325 , " a young adult novel about a teen who commits suicide and leaves behind audio recordings sharing 13 reasons she decided to end her life			1
" @entity325 " was the third most - challenged book in 2012 , according to the @entity21 on whether @entity324 thought " @entity325 " would be controversial : " i was writing a book about issues that make most people uncomfortable , including me			1
that alone , i knew , could make it controversial			0
but these are issues people do experience			0
to emotionally reach people , i had to write my story honestly			0
but i also wanted the book to be available to as many people as possible , so i did write a slightly less - graphic alternate versioan of one scene			0
i let my publisher decide which to publish , and they correctly chose the more intense scene because readers needed to feel uncomfortable there to understand what the character was going through			0
" on how he responded to attempts to ban the book : " the times i 've heard about challenges , there have been people in those communities defending my book			1
in one , there was a school board meeting to decide whether to remove my book from the library , and a parent read aloud one scene without context			1
it took a student at the school , stepping up to the microphone , to teach those adults about context			0
as a result , the book remained in the school			0
other times , principals have concerns about my book being used in the classroom , and a teacher will contact me to see what i can do to help the principal make a decision			0
i send them e-mails from readers expressing what they gained from reading the book			0
i know why i wrote my book , and i know what readers are getting from it			0
i would have no problem attending a meeting if i thought it would help the decision makers be less afraid			0
" on how it affected his views on censorship : " having spoken to thousands of teens since my book came out , i even more firmly believe that books dealing with these issues need to be written as emotionally honest as possible			1
not only is it appropriate , it 's responsible			0
if people are dealing with it , we need to talk about it			0
otherwise , we contribute to the main reason people do n't reach out for help			0
i consistently hear readers say my book was the first time they felt understood , which is sad			0
i 'm sure many people around them would understand			0
if my book proves that there are people who get what they 're going through , i 'm honored			0
the very day i found out ' @entity325 ' was the third most - challenged book , i received an e-mail from a reader claiming my book kept her from committing suicide			1
i dare any censor to tell that girl it was inappropriate for her to read my book			0
" if a parent feels their child should n't read a book , that 's their prerogative			0
