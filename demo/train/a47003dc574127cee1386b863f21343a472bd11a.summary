-- ever gotten on a plane and wound up in the wrong city ? how about the wrong continent ? according to a @entity6 report , that 's the travel nightmare story @entity7 and her husband , @entity8 , will get to tell for the rest of their lives			0
the couple boarded a flight in @entity15 booked by @entity16 , intending to travel to @entity17 , @entity18 , in western @entity19			1
instead , they got off the plane in @entity22 , @entity23 , in @entity24 , almost 7,000 miles away			1
the culprit was apparently a mix - up between the similarly pronounced cities and the three - letter code used by airlines to distinguish airports			1
the three - letter airport code on the tickets issued to the couple by the airline read @entity35 , the code for the airport in @entity22			1
the code for the airport in @entity17 is @entity40			0
the couple simply assumed that @entity35 was the code for their airport			1
" even after they 'd settled into their seats -- @entity45 and @entity46 in economy class -- they had no idea anything was amiss , " according to the @entity6			0
" when the flight attendant said we were heading to @entity22 , we believed that this was how you pronounced ' @entity17 ' with a @entity54 accent , " @entity49 told the @entity6			0
after connecting through @entity56 , the weary couple fell asleep on their next flight			2
when they awoke they began sensing a problem when they looked around to see a plane full of @entity65 faces , not @entity19 ones			2
a check of the inflight video map confirmed their fears			1
" that 's when we knew a serious mistake had been made , " @entity49 told the @entity6			0
after landing in @entity22 , the airline flew the couple to @entity17 via @entity56 , about a six - hour trip			2
it took two more days for the pair 's baggage to catch up to them			0
the couple booked their tickets in december ; the report did n't say when they traveled .			0

couple intends to fly to @entity19 , goes to @entity24 instead
mix - up *blamed* on three - letter airport codes
travelers confirmed nightmare on in - flight video map
