-- being nice to others and cooperating with them are n't uniquely human traits			1
@entity3 , director of @entity5 's @entity4 at the @entity4 in @entity6 , @entity7 , studies how our close primate relatives also demonstrate behaviors suggestive of a sense of morality			1
@entity13 recently published a book called " @entity15 and the @entity16 : in @entity17 , " which synthesizes evidence that there are biological roots in human fairness , and explores what that means for the role of religion in human societies			1
@entity0 's @entity27 recently spoke with @entity13 about the book			1
more about @entity30 's research @entity0 's @entity27 : tell us about the title of your book			1
@entity3 : well , the reason i chose that title is , when i bring up the origins of morality , it revolves around @entity40 , or comes from religion , and i want to address the issue that i think morality is actually older than religion			1
so i 'm getting into the religion question , and how important is religion for morality			1
i think it plays a role , but it 's a secondary role			1
instead of being the source of morality , religion came later , maybe to fortify morality			1
@entity0 : how would you say that ethics or morality is separate from religion ? @entity13 : well , i think that morality is older			1
in the sense that i find it very hard to believe that 100,000 or 200,000 years ago , our ancestors did not believe in right and wrong , and did not punish bad behavior , did not care about fairness			1
very long ago our ancestors had moral systems			1
our current institutions are only a couple of thousand years old , which is really not old in the eyes of a biologist			1
so i think religion came after morality			1
@entity64 may have become a codification of morality , and it may fortify it , but it 's not the origin of it			1
@entity0 : why do people need religion ? @entity13 : well , that 's a good question			1
i 'm struggling with that			1
i 'm personally a nonbeliever , so i 'm struggling with if we really need religion			1
... i 'm from the @entity74 , where 60 % of the people are nonbelievers			1
so in northern @entity78 , there are actually experiments going on now with societies that are more secular , to see if we can maintain a moral society that way , and for the moment i would say that experiment is going pretty well			1
... personally i think it is possible to build a society that is moral on a nonreligious basis , but the jury is still out on that			2
@entity0 : so do you believe that people are generally good ? @entity13 : yeah , my view is that you have two ( kinds of ) people in the world			2
you have people who think that we are inherently bad and evil and selfish , but with a lot of hard work we can be good , and you have other people like myself who believe that we are inherently good			2
there 's a lot of evidence on the primates that i can use to support that idea that we are inherently good , but on occasion when we get too competitive or frustrated , we turn bad			1
@entity0 : so when the stakes are higher for survival , we 're more individualistic than group - oriented ? @entity13 : oh no , we very much survive by group life			2
humans are not able to survive alone			2
for example , solitary confinement is one of the worst punishments we can give			2
we are not really made to live alone , we would not survive , and so when things get tough we would actually come together more and be more social when things get tough			2
@entity0 : can you talk about how being nice to another individual helps you ? @entity13 : sometimes people put that in a very narrow sense , and they say that everything that humans do or that animals do needs to have a payoff , but that 's not true			2
the example ... of adoption of children , i basically think it 's a costly act with no payoff , and these things happen in animals also			2
animals sometimes help each other even between species			2
dolphins may help human swimmers , and i do n't think the dolphins get much out of it			1
so individual acts do n't necessarily need to have a payoff			2
so they are not selfishly motivated			2
they are really altruistic , but you have the tendency to help , and to have empathy for others in general , on the average , is beneficial			2
because you live in a group , you depend on these others , so you need to care about these others also because your survival depends on group life , and so there is some sort of general payoff , but people often think in terms of each individual act needs to ( reap ) some benefit but that 's not necessarily true			2
@entity0 : tell us more about the origins of empathy			2
@entity13 : we think that the origin of empathy , in the mammals at least , has to do with maternal care			2
so a female , whether you 're a mouse or an elephant , you need to pay attention to your offspring , you need to react to their emotions when they 're cold , or in danger , or hungry , and that 's where we think the sensitivity to others ' emotions come from			0
that also explains why empathy is more developed in females than males , which is true in many animals , and it 's true for humans , and it explains the role of oxytocin			0
oxytocin is a maternal hormone			0
if you spray oxytocin into the nostrils of men and women , you get more empathic ( empathetic ) reactions from them , and so the general thinking about empathy is that it started in the mammals with maternal care , and then from there it spread to other relationships			0
so men can definitely have empathy , but they on average have a little bit less of it than women			0
@entity0 : by empathy , you mean that they feel each others ' pain ? @entity13 : well , feeling someone else 's joy is also empathy			0
being affected by the laugh , as humans are , is a form of empathy			0
so empathy basically says that you 're sensitive to the emotions of others and react to the emotions of others			0
sympathy is a bit more complicated			0
sympathy is that you want to take action			0
you want to help somebody else who 's in trouble			0
so sympathy is a bit more specific , it 's a bit more action - oriented			0
empathy is just a sensitivity			0
empathy is not necessarily positive			0
if someone wants to sell you a bad car for a high price , he also needs to empathize with you in order to get you to buy it			0
so empathy can be used for good purposes ; i think most of the time it is , but it is not always used for good purposes			0
@entity0 : in your book , you talk about a female primate who is crouching down giving birth while the rest of the group gathers around , and one of the other females is crouching and acting like the one giving birth			1
would that be an example of empathy ? @entity13 : yeah , that 's an act of mimicry and synchronization , which is the first form of empathy			0
if you talk with a sad person , you 're going to have a sad expression on your face			0
you 're going to feel sad very soon			0
that is the body channel of empathy			0
you synchronize with the other , and that female in the birthing scenario was synchronizing with the other			0
it 's a very early form of empathy ; we call it " modes of mimicry , " when you do the same thing as somebody else			0
the body channel of empathy is very important to us and we rely on it every day			0
if you talk with people and you adopt their facial expressions , they will be laughing , you will be laughing , and so on			0
@entity0 : different cultures of humans have different ideas about morality			1
is it the same way in primates ? do different groups of primates have different cultures and ways of interacting with each other ? @entity13 : we do think that primates have different cultures			1
one group behaves quite differently from another one			0
i 'm not sure that i would say they have different moralities , but they may have different styles of interacting			0
but ( with ) the human variation in morality , one society may have different moral rules than another one			1
in our current society in the @entity305 we have debates about gay marriage , abortion - we have a lot of moral debates going on , and years from now we will believe different things from what we believe now , and so morality changes as a result of society , and that means you should not look for specifics of your morality in biology			1
biology provides some of the general primate psychology that we have , like pro-social tendencies , sense of fairness , following rules			1
our primate background provides that kind of thing , but the specific rules that our society adopts are not contained in biology , and sometimes people confuse that when i say that morality is contained in our biology , that every rule we follow has to come out of biology			1
i do n't think it works that way			0
i think that we have general tendencies that come from our primate ancestors , and we turn that into our moral system that is suitable to our way of living			0
@entity0 : is there anything we can learn from animals about how to live a good life ? @entity13 : i do n't think i can give you specific lessons for your life out of my animal studies , but i do think the animal studies have some sort of general message that is important			0
instead of looking at human morality as something we design in our heads â € ” the philosophers want us to believe that by logic and reasoning we arrive at moral principles â € ” i think it works very differently			1
we have a lot of feelings and tendencies that drive us to moral solutions , and yes , we often then later try to justify these solutions and come up with reasons for them , but that 's often secondarily			0
in primate behavior we can see they have a sense of fairness			1
they have empathy : they enforce rules among themselves , they can delay gratification and they can control their impulses			0
so many of these tendencies that go into our moralities can be found in other animals , but instead of them coming from logic and reasoning , they actually come from our primate psychology most of the time .			0

@entity3 *authored* a book about biological roots in human fairness
his research suggests morality is older than religion
