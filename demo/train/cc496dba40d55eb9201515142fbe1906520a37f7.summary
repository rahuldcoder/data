who has the data investigators used to shape their search for @entity3 , and why has n't it been released to the public ? the answer to those questions depends on who you ask			1
facing a growing chorus of criticism from scientists and family members who want to see more details about why searchers are combing the southern @entity16 for the missing @entity17 , @entity19 's top transportation official thursday claimed his country does n't have the raw data from the satellite 's communication with the plane as it flew thousands of miles off course			1
the data is crucial because it 's what led investigators to the area where they 're currently searching for the plane			2
and in recent days , some scientists outside the investigation have suggested they do n't trust investigators ' analysis of the data , and questioned whether searchers are even looking in the right place			1
" the raw data is with ( satellite company ) @entity41 , not with @entity19 , not with @entity42 , not with @entity43 , so if there is any request for this raw data to be made available to the public , it must be made to @entity41 , " acting minister of transportation @entity38 said			1
@entity42 officials heading the search in the @entity16 tell @entity50 they do n't have the raw data , either			1
but @entity41 , which owns the satellites , insists that the data has already been released to investigators			1
" @entity41 's raw data was provided to the investigation team at an early stage in the search for @entity3 , " @entity55 , the company 's vice president of external relations , told @entity50 's " @entity61 : @entity62			1
" he added , " we have very high confidence in the analysis of this data , which was independently evaluated by the international teams accredited to the official investigation			2
" it 's up to investigators , he said , to decide what they want to release -- and when			0
the company says the convention on @entity75 prevents the release findings from an investigation without the consent from the state conducting the investigation			0
" i do n't know who to believe , " @entity50 aviation analyst @entity81 said			1
" but is n't it awful that it 's quite evident somebody is lying here ? somebody is lying			1
we 're talking about something that involves a missing airliner , now 70 days			0
lives lost , families shattered			0
and there ( are ) people lying about this			0
i ca n't even believe ... it would be funny if it was n't so tragic			0
" aviation attorney @entity99 said he thinks the satellite company is obligated to release the data , whether or not @entity19 authorities have it			1
" unfortunately , you almost get the sense that they 're stalling , that there 's something in there that they do n't want the world to see			0
and that 's the problem , " @entity81 said			0
" that 's why there 's so little credibility right now about why this search zone has been identified			0
" search officials turn to private companies for help with no tangible evidence of flight 370 after more than two months of searching , officials are reaching out to commercial companies for help			1
more specialized devices will be needed in this new stage of the search , which will focus on reanalyzing data to help ensure the correct search area ; conducting a detailed mapping of the sea bed ; and deploying specialized autonomous underwater vehicles ( @entity132 )			1
the @entity19 government is in the process of acquiring tools from companies such as @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , acting transportation minister @entity38 said thursday			2
other nations may have other assets that would complement the search			0
devices such as @entity145 and deep - water towed side - scan sonars " are very expensive and scarce , " @entity38 said			0
@entity42 has estimated the new phase will cost $ 60 million			2
the breakdown of exactly who 's going to pay for what is not clear			0
for most of the two - month search , each of the 26 countries involved has paid for their own costs			0
but three countries have been holding high - level discussions on how to proceed -- @entity19 , where the plane is from ; @entity159 , which had more than 100 passengers on board ; and @entity42 , which had six passengers on board and is close to where the official search area is focused			1
" procurement arrangements for the use of commercial contractors will be undertaken by @entity42 , in consultation with @entity19 , " @entity38 said			1
better communications the @entity19 government has established a new committee to streamline communications between nations , families and others to release timely and transparent information , @entity38 said			2
relatives of those on board have lambasted @entity19 officials for weeks , saying they have not been forthcoming and transparent in releasing data about the plane , which disappeared on march 8 with 239 people on board			1
underwater search interrupted the announcements thursday came after the underwater search for @entity3 came to an abrupt stop			1
two technical problems -- a malfunctioning part on the @entity195 - 21 underwater drone and a broken transponder on the drone 's mother ship -- have forced the suspension of the underwater search for a least a few days , a @entity191 official said wednesday			1
the drone and the transponder were damaged this week when the vehicle was being hoisted onto the deck of the @entity42 vessel @entity204			2
the vehicle struck the navigation transponder , which extends over the side of the ship , said @entity209 , the @entity191 's deputy director of ocean engineering			0
the @entity211 currently is the only submersible looking for the @entity17 , which was traveling from @entity213 , @entity19 , to @entity214 when it disappeared			2
repairs were made to the submersible			0
but in subsequent tests , operators said the acoustic communications link on the @entity211 and the navigation transponder on the @entity204 malfunctioned			0
no spare parts for either device were on the ship , @entity209 said			0
parts necessary for the repairs are being shipped from the @entity225 to @entity42 , he added			2
broken parts to delay flight 370 search for days @entity228 : more robust flight tracking needed @entity3 : plane audio recording played in public for first time to @entity159 families			0

satellite company @entity41 says it already handed over raw data
@entity19 and @entity42 say they do n't have it
analyst : " i do n't know who to believe , but somebody is lying "
officials are looking to use more specialized devices in the underwater search
