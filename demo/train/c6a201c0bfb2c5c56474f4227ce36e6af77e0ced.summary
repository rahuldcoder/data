-- many leading brands , including @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , have begun introducing " carbon labeling " on products to give customers an idea of the environmental impact of the food that they are buying			1
how much carbon has that created ? food with co2 emissions labels can be confusing			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity15 , director of the @entity17 - based @entity16 , an initiative committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the food chain , about the pros and cons of the system			1
@entity0 : how do carbon emissions arise in food production ? @entity26 : only talking about carbon emissions is actually a bit of a misnomer			1
we should be looking at the full spectrum of greenhouse gases produced during food production			2
once food has left the farm gate , then we are mainly dealing with carbon dioxide from transport and packaging			1
but while on the farm it 's nitrogen oxide and methane			2
they are present in smaller quantities but are much more potent in terms of the effect they have			2
@entity0 : what proportion of our carbon emissions come from food ? @entity26 : estimates vary			1
for the @entity17 it 's around 19 percent , but one @entity54 report puts @entity56 emissions at 31 percent			0
the thing to understand is this is a relative statistic , so if you 're talking about a society where people do n't have many cars and @entity62 , then the proportion will be quite high			2
it may actually be lower in countries with a high material standard of living			2
also , the estimates differ depending upon the boundaries they use , what 's included and what 's not included in the calculations			0
@entity0 : do you think food - miles are a useful measure of the environmental impact of food ? @entity26 : they have been useful in raising awareness of where food comes from and how it is transported , but in real environmental terms it 's more useful to look at total greenhouse emissions			1
when we do that then there are often quite counterintuitive results			0
for example , it might be more environmentally friendly to truck tomatoes from @entity92 to northern @entity56 rather than grow them in heated greenhouses closer by			0
also , different modes of transport have different footprints ; sea freight is better than road , for example			0
@entity0 : what does carbon labeling hope to achieve ? @entity26 : well , it 's predicated on the assumption that it will persuade consumers to make the right choice to cut their emissions , and i 'm not sure it will			1
that would depend on having the time to construct a very consistent , clear message , and i 'm not sure we do			2
carbon labeling could be very good for manufacturers , to help them understand the wastage and unnecessary expense in their business , but if it 's left to consumer choice i 'm not sure it will achieve the wholesale shift towards more sustainable living that we need			1
just buying low carbon chips wo n't change anything ; we need to reduce the overall percentage of the high impact foods -- meat and dairy -- in our diet			1
@entity0 : is there a global standard of labeling ? @entity26 : there are a plethora of different labels in @entity56 and the @entity139 , and at present there is n't a global standard			1
it would certainly be a good idea , and at the @entity56 level it looks quite likely			2
but i 'm not sure about the @entity139 my impression is that they are quite behind on food awareness			2
@entity0 : do you think labeling can reduce carbon emissions in the food production system ? @entity26 : that depends on significant interest from consumers in their carbon emissions , which i 'm not sure exists			1
but even if it does , shaving 10 or 20 percent off certain products does n't create a different mind - set			0
low carbon snacks wo n't change the world			1
we need to be asking : do we need all this stuff ? the science says we need to make 80 percent cuts in emission by 2050 , and we just do n't have time to be trimming the edges			0
@entity0 : do you think labeling could damage developing world economies that are based around exports ? @entity26 : possibly			1
when the @entity177 ( a @entity17 organic certification body ) had a consultation on whether they would certify air freighted products , there was an outcry from the @entity17 @entity183 as well as producers overseas			0
but they might find if we looked at total carbon emissions rather than food miles , they might do better , with hours of free sunshine and long growing seasons reducing the need for heating and other inputs			1
@entity0 : do you think labeling will change consumer behavior ? @entity26 : we need a far stronger steer from government on what a low - impact lifestyle looks like			1
tinkering around with elements of consumer behavior wo n't deliver the changes we need			0
the government needs to be involved			0
we need to work on choice editing , and make sure products are sending the right signals to consumers about the kind of diet they need to adopt , but they are very scared of doing this			2
there are certain synergies with health that could be exploited -- less meat and dairy is better for us as well as the environment			0
we need to be looking at the portions of meat and dairy in ready meals , and getting people used to a different way of eating			0
i think a lot can be achieved in quite subtle ways , as well as with more gung - ho regulation			0
ultimately , this is a systemic problem			0
of course public awareness and information is important , but to get the change we need we will have to take drastic action			0
we just have n't got time to woo people for years			0
we need to act right now .			0

food and *climate* expert @entity15 talks to @entity0 about carbon labeling
@entity26 : low carbon foods not answer ; we need to reduce " high impact foods " in diet
@entity26 : carbon labeling not always clear for consumers but good for manufacturers
