-- the forthcoming trial in @entity2 of @entity3 could be the last occasion on which a @entity6 war crimes suspect faces prosecution			1
@entity2 officials claim @entity3 was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a @entity6 death camp			1
but the legacy of decades - old efforts to bring the perpetrators of @entity16 atrocities to justice means that those who commit similar offences in the 21st century will not be able to hide from their past so easily , according to a leading war crimes prosecutor			1
many leading nazis such as @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 were prosecuted by the main allies -- the @entity27 , the @entity28 and the @entity29 -- shortly after the end of the war at the @entity32			2
@entity34 judge @entity33 , formerly the chief @entity35 prosecutor for war crimes in @entity37 and @entity38 , told @entity0 that @entity39 had been the " first attempt of any importance to hold war criminals accountable " and had laid the foundations for the development of modern humanitarian law			1
yet many lower - ranking servants of the @entity6 regime and its allies were able to escape punishment for their crimes , assuming new identities , fleeing @entity52 or even finding employment with @entity28 or western security agencies as determination to bring them to justice waned with the advent of the @entity59 , according to rabbi @entity60 of the @entity61			1
" these murderers walked into small cities and killed men , women and children and walked away without a trace , " @entity60 told @entity0			0
" the sad thing is that had the world wanted to prosecute @entity6 war criminals after @entity39 , and had ( countries ) put up the budget and the resources then every one of these elusive criminals would have been brought to justice			1
" but @entity33 said that the creation in 2002 of the @entity77 marked a " very important step forward " to ensure that future atrocities would not be so quickly forgotten			2
while previous tribunals investigating crimes in @entity38 and @entity37 were ad hoc creations set up by the @entity83 , the @entity77 is a permanent institution with a specific remit to investigate and prosecute cases of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes			1
@entity33 said that developments in humanitarian law and the evolution of international justice meant that modern institutions were more sophisticated and fairer than @entity39 had been , recognizing the rights of victims to representation but also ensuring a fair trial for defendants			1
" modern international law requires trials that are a lot fairer than the trials that were put on at @entity39 , " he said			0
the jurisdiction of the @entity77 is currently recognized by 108 countries -- though not by the @entity27 , @entity105 or @entity106			0
but @entity33 said the court was " moving quickly " towards universal ratification and said @entity27 president @entity108 's new administration was likely to be more cooperative and friendlier to the @entity77 than predecessor @entity109 had been in office			0
" i 'd love to see the day when there is universal ratification because when that happens there will be nowhere for war criminals to run to , " he said			0
@entity3 , an 89 - year - old native @entity116 deported from the @entity27 this week , is alleged to have been a guard at the @entity119 death camp in @entity6 - occupied @entity120 and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of more than 29,000 people			2
@entity60 said @entity3 's extradition marked the culmination of greater efforts in the @entity27 since the late 1970s to send suspected war criminals to face trial			2
an @entity129 was established in 1979 to hunt for war criminals on @entity27 soil , while legislation allowed even suspects who had acquired @entity27 citizenship to be extradited for lying on their naturalization papers about their @entity6 pasts			2
but he said @entity3 's trial could be the last of its kind -- and not just because of the age of suspected war criminals still at large			1
" you ca n't just have a trial with documents			0
you have to have living witnesses , " @entity60 said			0
" most of those witnesses are very old , most of them are well into their 80s and beyond and they have to be in sufficient good health that they can be questioned and travel to take part in the trial			0
" but @entity60 said it was very important that former nazis were pursued to the grave , living out their final years with the fear that their past crimes could still catch up with them			0
" ( @entity6 hunter ) @entity159 talked about two kinds of justice			2
there is the justice of handcuffs and putting someone on trial			0
but there is also a psychological fear of a knock on the door , " he said			0
" every @entity6 war criminal should live every night of his life with the possibility that in his case there will yet be a knock on the door			1

expert : trial of @entity6 war crimes suspect @entity3 could be last of its kind
leading @entity186 prosecuted at @entity39 but many *lesser* @entity186 escaped justice
*struggle* to prosecute @entity186 influenced creation of @entity77
@entity77 has remit to probe war crimes , genocide , crimes against humanity
