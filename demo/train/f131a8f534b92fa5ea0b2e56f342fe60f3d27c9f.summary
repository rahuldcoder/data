-- in a single column , a veteran police officer has catapulted himself into the national debate over the death of unarmed teen @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
" i 'm a cop			2
if you do n't want to get hurt , do n't challenge me , " the @entity9 headline blares			2
the piece was written by @entity12 , a 17 - year veteran of the @entity13			1
" even though it might sound harsh and impolitic , here is the bottom line : if you do n't want to get shot , tased , pepper - sprayed , struck with a baton or thrown to the ground , just do what i tell you , " he wrote			1
@entity12 cautions against arguing , insulting , or screaming at officers , " and do n't even think of aggressively walking towards me			1
most field stops are complete in minutes			0
how difficult is it to cooperate for that long ? " if you believe an officer is violating your rights or bullying you , @entity12 says , do n't challenge him then -- save that for lodging a complaint later			1
" do what the officer tells you to and it will end safely for both of you			0
" it took no time for the anger over his message to explode			0
" the outrageous thing is not that he says it			1
the outrageous thing is that we accept it , " writes @entity41 of the blog @entity42 , which tracks @entity45 legal issues			1
" do we have a justice system ? by name , yes			0
is it effective in deterring cops from abusing citizens or punishing them when they do ? no.			0
. if you hope the cop will be charged criminally for misbehavior , you 're going to be waiting a very long time for no result			2
" @entity12 's message is to " shut up and take it , because even the slightest bit of intransigence is grounds for the cops to unleash a world of hurt , " writes @entity65 of the @entity66			1
" to say that putting up a verbal argument warrants bringing out the billy clubs , stun guns , or actual guns only stokes what 's been seen coming out of @entity6 in the past week -- images of peaceful demonstrators being met with a lines of officers rigged with military - grade equipment , marchers being fogged with canisters of tear gas , and people being slugged with rubber bullets after not moving quickly enough , " @entity65 complains			1
authorities in @entity6 say force has been needed to stop the minority of " agitators " who have fomented violence , through gunshots and @entity90 cocktails			1
@entity0 users weighed in on social media			0
" so , ' do what i say or i will hurt / kill you ? ' how does that even remotely correspond with ' to serve and @entity99 ? ' " @entity93 wrote on @entity94 , citing the police motto			2
but @entity100 wrote on @entity101 , " i think an officer puts his life on the line on a daily basis			0
he wants to go home after his shift like everyone else			0
no one should challenge him			0
" @entity111 , a business owner and father of four in @entity6 , told @entity0 " people are just tired " of being pulled over when they did nothing wrong , so it 's common to give police attitude in the area			1
but he teaches his children not to			0
" when you see police , respect the police , " he tells them			1
" say ' yes sir and ' no sir			0
' it 'll get you a long way			0
" and since loitering can lead police to think you 're up to no good , he adds , " keep it moving			2
" " if you let your attitude take over , that can be you laying on that ground , " @entity111 adds			1
in @entity12 's column , published tuesday , he writes , " cops are not murderers			1
no officer goes out in the field wishing to shoot anyone , armed or unarmed			0
" still , he does not defend all police			2
" i know it is scary for people to be stopped by cops			0
i also understand the anger and frustration if people believe they have been stopped unjustly or without a reason			0
i am aware that corrupt and bully cops exist			0
when it comes to police misconduct , i side with the @entity148 : having worked as an internal affairs investigator , i know that some officers engage in unprofessional and arrogant behavior ; sometimes they behave like criminals themselves			2
" complete coverage of @entity6 shooting and protests @entity12 notes that people do n't have to submit to illegal stops or searches , and can refuse consent to search a car or home without a warrant			1
" always ask the officer whether you are under detention or are free to leave			0
unless the officer has a legal basis to stop and search you , he or she must let you go			0
finally , cops are legally prohibited from using excessive force : the moment a suspect submits and stops resisting , the officers must cease use of force			0
" but protesters throughout the country say submitting to an officer does n't always avoid police brutality			1
they point to the case of @entity181 , killed by @entity183 police in a chokehold in july			2
and in @entity186 , a 51 - year - old woman was seen on video being repeatedly punched by a @entity188 officer			0
in a @entity0 column last week , @entity189 of the @entity190 in @entity183 wrote that her son died nearly 20 years ago in an illegal police chokehold			1
" these tragedies and injustices happen year after year , and people of color -- primarily black and @entity198 -- are usually the victims			0
" " police - community relations can only start to improve when individual officers who abuse civilians ' rights are held accountable with a zero - tolerance policy for police brutality , " she says			2
@entity12 wants all police to use body cameras and video recorders in their vehicles , which " will prevent a situation like @entity212 's shooting , about which conflicting and self - serving statements allow people to believe what they want			1
" the events that led up to the teen 's shooting remain unclear , with very different descriptions emerging			0
while @entity12 comes off as " reasonable , " he is demanding " unresisting submission to police without argument or even legal protest , " @entity220 writes at @entity225			1
" just how do you ' refuse consent to search your car or home ' without running afoul of the no - nos @entity12 warns may get you ' shot , tased , pepper - sprayed , struck with a baton or thrown to the ground ? ' " journalists who were arrested amid @entity6 protests have reported they did nothing wrong			1
@entity12 , a professor of homeland security and criminal justice at @entity238 , could not be reached immediately for comment wednesday on the uproar over his column			1
in a tweet linking to his response , the @entity66 's @entity65 wrote , " i challenged officer @entity12			1
hopefully he wo n't come hurt me			2
" magazine : the aftermath in @entity6 read more about the flash point in the @entity248 at @entity0 / @entity45			2

new : father in @entity6 : respect police , or it could be " you laying on that ground "
" if you do n't want to get shot , tased *...* do what i tell you , " a veteran cop writes
@entity12 spent 17 years with the @entity13
" the outrageous thing is that we accept it , " a critic writes
