-- the brutal murders of the @entity3 ambassador to @entity4 and three @entity3 diplomatic staffers in @entity6 underscore the profound fragility of @entity3 relations in the region			1
it is hard to recall a time when crises such as this and in the @entity14 afflicted so many @entity3 interests simultaneously , nor one in which @entity3 policies were so deeply at risk			1
the tragic events in eastern @entity4 themselves represent the culmination of events that began and unfolded well outside the mainstream of @entity4 life or the @entity3 relationship with that country			1
an obscure filmmaker in @entity28 produced a slapdash video that was seized upon by an extremist group of @entity3 who have in the past distinguished themselves for the toxic cocktail of hate and stupidity that drives their actions			2
via the special contagion of the @entity41 , their vileness , which once would have been as hidden from view as it deserved to be , triggered protests at the @entity3 consulate in @entity6 , @entity4 , and at the @entity44 in @entity45			1
opinion : what terrorists want us to believe about @entity4 @entity3 sources told @entity0 on wednesday that the @entity6 attack was planned in advance , and the attackers used the film protest outside the consulate as a diversion			1
the sources could not say whether the attackers instigated the protest or merely took advantage of it , and they say they do n't believe ambassador @entity60 was specifically targeted			1
but targeted or not , the victims were @entity3 diplomats who had willingly undertaken the risky mission of trying to assist the advent of democracy in that faraway place			2
this violence underscores that deep hatreds lie just beneath the surface across the region , even in countries where relations with the @entity3 have had important positive dimensions , either recently or over an extended period			1
the problems run deep for the region and @entity3 president @entity78 's administration			1
first , the riots and violence illustrate that the broader political circumstances in the countries of the @entity83 remain unresolved and potentially vulnerable to serious disruption from even small opposition groups			1
the @entity88 government , slow to condemn the @entity90 attacks tuesday , has itself been unsettled by violence across the country in the past couple of months			0
second , however , these are hardly the only tensions bubbling over in the greater @entity14 and @entity95			1
the situation in @entity97 not only is worsening daily but is spilling over as refugees seek haven in @entity101 and @entity102			2
the @entity104 government , increasingly undependable as a friend of the @entity3 , has allowed @entity107 aid flights to @entity108 despite @entity3 protests			1
@entity111 allies are turning on @entity3 troops with alarming regularity			2
the @entity114 just underscored the increasing threat from @entity117 extremist groups by finally citing the @entity119 - affiliated @entity118 as a terrorist group			2
but perhaps the fault line of greatest concern to the @entity78 team , even as the bad news was filtering out of @entity6 , is the standoff with @entity107 regarding its nuclear program and the deterioration in the relationship between the @entity3 and @entity129 , historically our closest ally in the region			1
@entity4 , @entity133 react to killings , film controversy the @entity3 - @entity129 relationship reached a new low on tuesday with prime minister @entity138 angrily reacting to secretary of state @entity140 's assertion that @entity141 would not specify " red lines " regarding @entity107 's nuclear program ; and then the @entity129 leaking word that @entity78 refused to meet with him during the upcoming @entity147 meetings in @entity148			1
this resulted in a late - night call between @entity78 and @entity138 that was ostensibly intended to show the allies were communicating and acting in tandem			2
but the @entity153 denied the @entity129 had even requested a meeting with @entity78 in @entity148 , revealing the depth of the problem			2
when allies ca n't agree even on what they disagree about , the relationship is in trouble			0
both sides are scrambling to do damage control -- and behind the scenes are fuming			0
neither feels like the other is behaving like a friend			0
that 's because there are very real differences between the leadership groups in both countries , and this complicates a tough situation			0
every sign of tension and every delay plays into @entity107 's hands and enables it to advance further with nuclear weapons development			2
these deepening tensions keep the @entity78 team -- desperate to avoid an october surprise before november 's elections -- scrambling with high - level meetings and planning high - level trips to the region , and reveal similar risks for the campaign of @entity190 nominee @entity189			0
@entity189 on tuesday issued a prepared release condemning the @entity78 team 's handling of the @entity90 and @entity4 violence			0
it was almost instantly overtaken by the news of the deaths in @entity6 , making the @entity189 critique seem ugly			0
it was ill - considered and ill - timed , and underscores that in presidential campaigns , no candidate gets to pick the stories that drive the headlines -- and that foreign policy often crops up to complicate matters and test a candidate 's real readiness			0
@entity189 , with his earlier comments on @entity210 and in @entity129 regarding @entity211 , reveal he needs more temperate counsel			0
headline - grabbing and statesmanship seldom go together , as demonstrated in the past 24 hours by the war of words between @entity129 and the @entity3 and in @entity189 's misstep			1
in fragile times and when longer term interests are at stake , restraint goes a long way			0
the best work is often done quietly , behind the scenes			0
it is done by people like ambassador @entity60 , his colleagues who also died and those that remain on the ground in @entity4 and across the region			1
they understood that they were taking on considerable risks , as did their government			0
they did so willingly , because they knew it was only through accepting those risks and making a long - term commitment to the region that progress could be achieved			0
that must be their legacy and it is a message that needs to be heard and understood by the @entity3 people before they overreact one way or another to each or any of the current crises			0
indeed , it is in times like these we must emulate in our policies the best qualities of the lives they led .			0
