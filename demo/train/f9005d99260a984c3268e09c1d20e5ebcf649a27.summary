he was supposed to be the fifth act			0
" it was 5 o'clock and nothing was happening yet , " @entity3 told @entity9			1
" i had the least instruments ( to set up on stage ) and the least people ( in his band )			0
" so @entity3 went on and performed for 40 minutes , as planned			1
organizers asked him to do four more songs , he told @entity9			2
" i went back and did that , then it was , ' four more songs ... ' and that kept happening ' til two hours and 45 minutes later , i had sung every song i know , " he said			0
@entity3 , a @entity26 , @entity27 , native , told @entity0 in 1999 that music enabled him to leave his rough neighborhood to head to @entity30 and the music scene there			1
music was always a part of his life			1
" i believe i inherited my sense of music from my father			2
my father was an ear piano player ; he could just hear something and play it , " he recalls			0
" i came up in @entity26 singing doo - wop music from the time i was 13 to the time i was 20			1
that music served a purpose of keeping a lot of people out of trouble , and also it was a passport from one neighborhood to another			2
" his inspiration for songs about social change and protest came when he heard artists like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
that 's when he knew what he wanted to do with his life			0
" it was the songs that actually changed my life , " he says			0
" the songs that i heard were so much different than the doo - wop kind of thing			0
they were just so powerful			0
finally i decided , ' i 've got to do this			0
' " before @entity6 , his nights were filled with playing as often as possible to make a few dollars			1
" we played three coffeehouses a night , 14 sets a night , 20 - minute sets , pass the basket , stay alive , " he told @entity0			1
" i was there seven and a half years , every day			0
it was the most incredibly magic , magic time			0
" after @entity76 gained attention at @entity6 , he recorded a soulful - voiced cover of the @entity79 , " which rose on the pop charts in 1970			1
@entity81 of @entity82 said @entity3 was an inspiration for the natural gravel in his singing voice			1
he called @entity76 a passionate performer			0
" he lit fire when he started playing within the first song and burned exactly the same way throughout his set			0
and it never stopped , it never changed , " @entity81 said			2
he added that he thought @entity3 ' style was probably a little too arcane to appeal to a mass audience			2
" but he sure knew what to do when they were begging for someone to go on first , when all those people showed up at @entity6 , " @entity81 said			1
@entity3 returned to @entity6 for the 40th anniversary festival in 2009			1
