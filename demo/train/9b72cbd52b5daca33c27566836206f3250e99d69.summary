editor 's note : -- the night @entity4 lost the @entity6 leadership 20 - odd years ago , i was a tender recruit to the @entity8 press gallery who found myself , fortuitously , marooned at the prime minister 's office door whilst the @entity6 caucus was dispatching the occupant			1
mistaken by security guards -- then hastily clearing nearby corridors -- as a @entity17 staffer , i was left to witness @entity19 's return to his office and his waiting family as an ex-prime minister , at that time the only one to be rejected by his own party			2
@entity19 came striding out of the caucus room , chin forward , moist eyes straight ahead , a clutch of dejected staff trailing behind			0
at the same moment his office door opened and out burst his then - wife , @entity32 , sobbing			0
either she 'd been expecting the worst or , more probably , there had been a phone call telegraphing it			0
she flung herself at her husband			0
@entity19 gathered her up , telling her " do n't cry , do n't cry			0
" and as he disappeared into his office , he barked : " i need a bloody cup of tea			0
" if the humiliation of that evening 's historic rejection winded him , @entity19 did n't show it			0
soon afterwards trolleys of liquor were rolling along the corridors of @entity45 and @entity19 hosted a wake that went for hours , open to all comers			0
he angered , in my sight , only once that night ; he rounded on a particular reporter who had showered him with sympathy but who , in @entity19 's view , had been long doing the bidding of the victor , @entity58			2
@entity61 fm @entity59 resigns never before had the @entity6 dumped a serving prime minister , yet @entity19 's equanimity -- outwardly at least -- was striking			1
you might have said he seemed both resigned and liberated about the loss of the job he 'd held for nearly nine years			0
of course , the long contest with @entity58 had been aggravating to @entity19 and sapping for his government ; @entity58 had effectively launched his challenge late the year before , in 1990 , when he contended , in his @entity74 speech , that @entity61 had never had a great prime minister			1
then he challenged @entity19 in mid- 1991 , lost and went to the back bench until his second -- and successful challenge -- at the end of that year			2
@entity19 , the @entity6 and most @entity61 knew that @entity58 had @entity19 lined up for the kill			1
it has been an undeclared , subterranean campaign to reinstall @entity59 in the prime minister 's office -- one from which the candidate has , until now , been able to stay aloof			1
@entity59 has portrayed himself as busy and contented within the @entity84 under @entity85			1
as he described it last week , he has been " a happy little @entity87 " being @entity61 's foreign minister			1
invariably for @entity59 , questions about the quality of the @entity6 leadership , the propriety of those who removed him from the prime minister 's office or of who posted the now - infamous video of his rage on @entity96 all are questions that should , he contends , be asked of " others			1
" thus he causes those others -- and we mostly know who he means -- to fall under suspicion			0
and in the resulting public imagery , it is not @entity59 who is seeking to return to the prime minister 's office ; rather it is a semi-reluctant @entity59 who is being ferried along by a group of ministers , mps and @entity6 fixers who believe the only way that @entity6 can win against @entity112 and the @entity113 at the next election is for @entity59 to resume the leadership			1
@entity85 calls for @entity61 @entity6 leadership vote their tactic has been to avoid having @entity59 , unlike @entity58 , seen as an active seeker of his prime minister 's job			1
the @entity59 camp has not wanted to give the prime minister a reason to confront them head - on because to do so would be to risk provoking a leadership ballot before @entity59 has assembled the numbers he needs -- and it 's still doubtful that he has			1
second , for @entity59 to be seen publicly tearing at @entity85 's leadership would play to a series of strong negatives -- that @entity59 is motivated by revenge , that he has no regard for governance , that he is attacking a woman , that he has a monstrous sense of entitlement			1
it may even be true , as some of @entity59 's campaigners have claimed privately in the past few days , that @entity59 did not set out to regain his old job after he was deposed by @entity85 back in mid- 2010			1
that instead , the ongoing poor opinion polling for the @entity6 , some avoidable stumbles by @entity85 , stubborn resentment within the electorate about the manner of her ascendancy and the blandishments of some of his colleagues combined to persuade @entity59 that his return was feasible			1
but @entity59 had to be seen to be drafted by his party back into the prime minister 's office			1
behind the scenes of @entity61 's political ' soap opera ' that plan still seemed intact until 1.38pm on saturday february 18 , when a @entity96 user , under the name of @entity163 , uploaded a video showing a frustrated and increasingly furious @entity59 attempting to complete a video message in the @entity167 language but stumbling over the words			1
filmed at least two years ago in his office , while he was prime minister , the video contained @entity59 's unusable , profane outtakes , plenty of teeth - gnashing , wild - eyed fury , and blaming others including the " dickheads in the embassy			1
" because the footage most likely had been retained in a @entity181 archive , suspicion falls on the prime minister 's office or somewhere nearby as @entity184 's source			2
this conspiracy @entity85 denies , but the enquiry , @entity59 says , is another of those " questions for others			2
" whatever its source , @entity184 's video most likely will be remembered as much for the entertainment provided by a filthy @entity59 , as for the trigger that brought his leadership challenge into the open			1
@entity59 learned of @entity163 's @entity96 activity early on saturday evening as he was eating a @entity195 take - away meal at his @entity197 home with @entity198 , the @entity199 - based political strategist who has guided many @entity6 election campaigns			2
@entity198 is now openly connected to the @entity59 campaign 's camp and helped advise @entity59 that night			2
" the conspiracy theorists are out in number , " says @entity198			0
" but i was with him , and he was embarrassed and concerned and understood that he had to manage the problem quickly			0
the complication was that he was leaving the country the next morning			0
so the decision was made to contact @entity209 , which is a 24 - hour news channel , and do an interview			0
as it turned out , i think that was the appropriate thing to do			0
" prompted and legitimized by the leaked video , by midnight saturday @entity59 was on @entity209 , effectively sending to the @entity6 and @entity61 a revised cv that set down his qualifications for another shot at the prime minister 's job			1
apologizing for his language in the video , he said he had changed since being deposed by @entity85 almost 20 months ago			2
he had learned to delegate more , to become less angry and listen up - especially to his colleagues			0
it was a coded application for the return of his former job			0
and it was reinforced on @entity59 's behalf on monday morning when the former @entity227 , @entity228 , publicly urged the prime minister to hold a leadership ballot			1
the @entity232 band of brothers -- @entity59 , @entity228 and @entity198 -- succeeded , finally , in flushing out publicly the prime minister 's senior ministerial supporters to concede that which they have been careful for weeks not to : @entity85 's leadership is under siege from within her own cabinet and party room			1
tactically the day was a victory for @entity59 ; the leadership issue was out in public and now , sooner or later , it will have to be confronted			2
there is anxiety and uncertainty on both sides over whether they have the numbers			0
@entity85 is not going to a ballot , yet , and behaves as if life is business as usual in her dealings with the man she calls her foreign minister , usually ( and unusually ) not by his name			1
and @entity59 is in the @entity258 resort city of @entity259 at a @entity261 meeting and will not return to @entity61 until the weekend			2
will he force a challenge when parliament returns on february 27 ? @entity198 -- a man who might know -- offers this : " i think , nevertheless , once @entity59 is back in town , there is going to be another buildup of pressure for this matter to be resolved once and for all			2
" should @entity59 force a ballot ? " i do n't know exactly how this is going to be played out			2
there are various scenarios but one thing that seems completely implausible is that it 's just going to go away and that people will forget about it and move on to another issue			0
this is a boil that has to be lanced			0
" @entity85 , you would expect , knows that			0
she 's wielded that lance before			0
read the original piece in the @entity2 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity287 and @entity288 .			0

@entity85 *replaced* @entity59 as prime minister in 2010 after he lost @entity6 support
*comparisons* drawn with contest between @entity4 and @entity58 more than 20 years ago
@entity59 was brought back as foreign minister and portrayed himself content serving @entity85
but the @entity61 media have speculated he may challenge for the party leadership
