-- the debate over the number of civilian casualties caused by @entity5 drone strikes in @entity6 is perhaps the most contentious issue in the often fraught @entity9 - @entity6 relationship			1
on one side are @entity9 officials who assert that the strikes kill few , if any , @entity6 civilians			2
in june 2011 , president @entity15 's then - counterterrorism adviser @entity14 claimed improbably during a speech at the @entity17 for @entity18 " there has n't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency , precision of the capabilities that we 've been able to develop			0
" two months later , @entity9 officials speaking on condition of anonymity told the @entity28 that around 50 civilians had been killed in drone strikes in @entity6 since the 9/11 attacks			1
on the other side of the debate are @entity6 officials such as the country 's powerful interior minister @entity35 , who asserted in 2012 that 80 % of the people killed in drone strikes were civilians			1
earlier this year , before he stepped down as interior minister , @entity35 told @entity6 reporters that the strikes had killed mostly women and children			2
similarly , @entity45 , leader of the @entity6 @entity47 party @entity46 ( @entity48 ) , told crowds at a 2011 conference in @entity51 that drones kill " dozens of innocent people daily			0
" now comes a leaked @entity6 government document that helps to shed light on some of the facts surrounding this debate			0
according to the internal @entity6 report , civilian casualties from drone strikes are much lower than has often been claimed in @entity6 , but they are also much higher than the @entity9 government has asserted			1
the @entity6 government confirmed 10 civilian deaths in @entity5 drone strikes in 2009 , according to the leaked official document obtained this week by the @entity66 , a @entity67 - based organization that tracks the strikes			1
the report also found that from 2006 through october 24 , 2009 , civilians made up a minority of those killed in drone strikes : 147 civilians in a total death toll of 742 , or about 20 %			0
that number is somewhat lower than the estimates of @entity78 nongovernmental organizations that track the strikes			0
the @entity80 estimates that up to 207 civilians were killed from 2006 to october 24 , 2009 , along with up to 198 people who were not identified in reliable media reports to be either civilians or militants			0
oddly , the leaked @entity6 report left out four strikes that occurred in 2007			2
it also missed nine strikes from 2008 and 2009 , in which between eight and 10 civilians were reported killed , according to the @entity80 's tally			0
the leaked report is a welcome sign that the @entity6 government is making a concerted effort to confirm the identities of those who have been killed in @entity9 drone strikes in the country 's remote tribal regions that border with @entity100			1
@entity6 authorities have long denounced the strikes , out of concern that civilian deaths caused by drone strikes inflame the local population , bolster militant groups and violate @entity6 's sovereignty			1
the civilian casualty rate has declined steadily over the life of the @entity5 drone program as both technology and intelligence - gathering have improved			2
one civilian -- a 10 - year - old boy -- has been confirmed killed so far in 2013 , according to reliable media reports			0
in 2012 , five civilians were confirmed killed , representing 2 % of the total deaths			0
as the civilian casualty rate has fallen , @entity6 officials who oppose the drone strikes have turned more frequently to the argument that they violate @entity6 's sovereignty , regardless of whom they kill			1
@entity6 's new prime minister , @entity123 , told parliament in june that " we respect the sovereignty of others and they should respect our sovereignty and independence			1
this campaign must come to an end			0
" as @entity123 wrangles with the @entity9 over the future of the drone program , a complete and authoritative official @entity6 tally of civilian deaths caused by drones would be a useful tool for those discussions			1
the leaked @entity6 report is a step in the right direction .			2

@entity9 drone program is especially *controversial* in @entity6
@entity144 : a leaked report suggests fewer civilian drone deaths than *previously* reported
@entity6 's new prime minister opposes drone program , cites issue of sovereignty
@entity153 : having reliable estimates on drone deaths is important
