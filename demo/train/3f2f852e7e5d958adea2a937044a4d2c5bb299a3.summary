-- @entity1 is gearing up for thousands more job cuts , with @entity4 's biggest bank by market value set to outline the next stage in its strategic overhaul at an investor day in two months ' time			1
" there is no fantastical new strategy out there , " said one person familiar with the bank 's planning			2
" but there 's still huge potential to be more efficient			0
" @entity18 , @entity1 's chief executive , said when he announced annual results last week that he would " fixate on costs " over the coming year and promised to find a further $ 1bn of annual savings in 2013			1
the job cuts target has still to be fixed but people close to the bank suggested up to 5,000 staff could go as part of the $ 1bn savings plan			1
if @entity1 maintained the recent rate of staff cuts to cost savings , the number would be closer to 10,000			1
mr @entity18 , in charge since early 2011 , has spent the past two years trying to streamline @entity1 's global network of fiefdoms , both in order to impose more control from head office in @entity38 and to strip out overlaps and inefficiencies			1
@entity1 has already exceeded its target of finding $ 2.5 - $ 3.5bn of cost savings by 2013 , announcing $ 3.6bn of " sustainable annual savings " with its 2012 results			1
but the bank remains as far as ever from a related target -- to cut the bank 's elevated cost - income ratio to between 48 and 52 per cent			2
last year the ratio , which measures overheads as a proportion of revenue , spiralled upwards to 62.8 per cent			0
the number was inflated by the one - off cost of paying a $ 1.9bn fine to @entity57 regulators over money laundering and sanctions abuses			0
but even with that stripped out the cost - income ratio was still 56 per cent , as revenue numbers were held back by anaemic economic growth in much of the world			0
the details of mr @entity18 's plan are set to be outlined to investors in may			0
the bank is expected to close or sell a further eight to 10 businesses this year and next , in addition to the 49 already divested since 2011			2
the new job cuts will come in addition to a sharp reduction of staff numbers -- from 302,000 to 260,000 -- over the past two years			1
about 10,000 of the headcount reduction so far has been the result of divestments , with the rest due to cuts			0
but according to people involved in planning the investor day , the tally of cuts could be more dramatic still if mr @entity18 presses ahead with plans to uproot @entity1 's tradition of in - house software development			1
the number of staff working in that area is already estimated to have been trimmed from 27,000 to about 21,000			0
but many more are likely to go as the bank shifts towards an outsourcing approach			0
bankers said contraction was likely to be gradual and would be offset to an extent by the creation of new jobs as @entity1 pushes aggressively into new technology areas , such as mobile banking			2
