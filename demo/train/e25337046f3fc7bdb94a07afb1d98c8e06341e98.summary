-- if all had gone to plan , @entity1 and @entity2 would have been neighbors co-existing in a strained but civil peace , aware of a bitter history but resolved to moving on			1
instead , just nine months after jubilant scenes in @entity2 as the nation declared independence , its relationship with the north is deteriorating rapidly amid violence , accusations and arguments			2
efforts by the @entity16 to broker peace have stalled , leading some to question whether the answer might lie more than 9,000 kilometers away in @entity19			2
a new report from the @entity21 says the country is engaged in a " delicate dance " as it tries to maintain its historic ties with @entity1 , while also courting @entity2			1
it argues that @entity19 should be doing more to promote peace between the fractious neighbors , who both stand to benefit from @entity30 's eagerness to invest in their crumbling and inadequate infrastructure			2
" @entity19 can and should do more -- in concert with other international actors to -- to ensure peaceful resolution , without compromising its interests or traditional adherence to a principle of non-interference , " said @entity33 , senior analyst on @entity1 and @entity2 with the @entity21			1
@entity1 denies report that @entity2 downed its fighter jet @entity19 has invested heavily in @entity1 's oil industry through state - owned oil giant @entity44 ( @entity44 )			1
it has a considerable stake in two of the three leading oil consortia operating in @entity1 -- the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) and @entity50 -- according to the @entity51 ( @entity51 )			1
last year , 66 % of all oil exported from @entity1 and @entity2 went to @entity19 , although that 's only a small fraction of @entity19 's total oil imports , according to the @entity51			1
the country still gets most of its oil imports from the @entity58			2
oil is one of the flashpoints in the current dispute between @entity1 and @entity2 , though it 's been a constant source of friction between warring parties in the nation long before the split			1
when @entity2 broke away from @entity1 last july , it took with it 75 % of the former country 's oil reserves			1
however , all of the country 's refining and export infrastructure remains in the north			0
in january , @entity2 shut down its oil production after accusing @entity1 of stealing oil			1
@entity1 countered that by saying it had seized the crude as compensation for unpaid pipeline and export transit fees			0
the shutdown is causing both countries financial pain			0
according to the @entity86 , oil contributes 90 % of @entity1 's export earnings , and 98 % of @entity2 's			1
the dispute over oil has long plagued the countries that signed a comprehensive peace agreement in 2005 after 21 years of fighting			0
part of the agreement included independence for @entity2 , which finally broke away in july 2011			0
just nine months later , there are fears the two countries are sliding back towards war			1
earlier this week , @entity100 secretary - general ban ki - moon again implored the countries ' leaders to immediately end hostilities and implement agreements already reached on security , border monitoring and the disputed oil - rich @entity108 area			0
" despite high rhetoric and recent provocations , i think the war calculations remain : both sides have more to lose than gain from a return to conflict			2
border clashes in recent days , however , continue to test those calculations as emotions run high , " @entity33 said			0
through its historical ties with @entity123 and its work to nurture a new relationship with @entity126 , analysts say @entity19 occupies a unique position as a potential mediator in their dispute			0
" they 're in a good position to act as an honest broker and the more that they can do then obviously the better because it 's going to save lives , " said @entity130 , a former @entity132 high commissioner and @entity133 in @entity134 and now professor of peace studies at the @entity137			0
" i think that @entity19 should be holding out as many carrots as they can , " she added			0
" they should be trying to get people at the number two level to talk together , so that really people are understanding each other , and there 's not such high levels of mistrust			0
" @entity130 said the conflict between the two neighbors gives @entity19 an opportunity to prove to its other @entity134 partners that it offers more than just a source of investment			1
@entity19 could prove " that it can bring a real advantage to the situation , " she said			0
" in this situation it would be proving it can do what the @entity16 ca n't			0
" a return to war , she said , would make @entity19 and its @entity134 partners " slightly twitchy ... because of the feeling that we need @entity19 to be not just our investment partner , but in a sense our friend , and our friend in times of crisis			2
" in the next few weeks , @entity2 's president @entity174 is due to make his first visit to @entity30 as head of state			0
it will give @entity19 another opportunity to nurture its relationship with the @entity2 , and perhaps erase some of the " lingering uneasiness " the @entity21 says @entity126 feels about @entity19 's relationship with @entity123			1
" resolution of the impasse and resuscitation of oil flows would undoubtedly influence the scope and character of the relationship that emerges ; whether the political and economic ties already established between @entity30 and @entity126 are robust enough to weather the current crisis remains to be seen , but both sides hope so , " said @entity181 , @entity134 program director for the @entity21 .			2
