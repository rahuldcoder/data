@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the world of business -- where book titles like " only the @entity6 " thrive -- successful executives hope for the best but plan for the worst			1
quarantined guests at @entity0 's @entity10 hotel wave to world press			1
but no amount of planning could have prevented the bad luck that befell the @entity10 hotel group last week			2
the @entity16 in @entity17 was shut down when a guest -- having recently arrived from his native @entity19 -- fell ill with the city 's first reported case of @entity22			1
@entity24 health officials , chastened by the experience of @entity26 , quickly quarantined the hotel and its nearly 300 guests and employees			1
the city is trying to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2003 , when a doctor from nearby @entity34 came to the @entity0 to attend a wedding			1
during his one - night stay the doctor , who had been treating patients with an unusual respiratory ailment , fell ill himself			0
he infected at least 10 other guests , according to @entity42 research			0
those guests then spread @entity26 to the rest of world			1
that hotel ? the @entity16 in @entity47			1
formerly known as the @entity49 , that hotel was ground zero for the first reported case of @entity26 in @entity0			1
both hotels are among four properties owned in the city by a subsidiary of @entity55 , which operates 50 hotels in @entity1			0
with the world press corps parked outside taking photographs of bored , confined customers , the hotel chain is realistic about its potential impact on business			0
" revenue loss and image damage is a concern , " said @entity63 , an operations manager for the chain			0
" when an incident like this happens , obviously , it will have a little impact on the business			0
" with this and the incident in 2003 , ( the situation ) was not caused by the hotel , and has nothing to do with the hygiene or the facilities of the property , " he said			2
" what we can do is try our best to make our guests , and the staff , comfortable to help them to overcome the quarantine and difficult times in forthcoming days			0
" the markets seem to have shrugged off the flu scare -- shares of @entity0 - listed @entity55 rose by nearly 6 percent in trading monday			2
still , what are the odds of the city 's first reported outbreak of two separate new illnesses being found at the same small hotel chain ? to calculate that , you would need to consider a variety of factors akin to the computation of lightning striking the same place twice			2
" it does seem like a bit of a freak occurrence , " said dr. @entity105 , an expert on economics and game theory at the @entity108			0
" but freak occurrences do happen			0
