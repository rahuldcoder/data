@entity0 is going to be a long year			0
well , one second longer			0
we 're all going to get an extra tick of the clock , known as a " leap second , " on june 30			1
the bonus sliver of time raises a couple of questions			2
how to spend that extra second ? sleeping ? working ? maybe @entity11 's @entity10 will use it to help keep up with his @entity13 book - reading program			2
then there 's the question of why we need to tinker with clocks all around the world in the first place			1
@entity20 vs. atomic clocks it all comes down to physics , according to @entity24 , the head of @entity25 at the @entity26 , which oversees atomic clocks in the @entity28			1
" the real simple explanation is the @entity20 is slowing down a little bit , " he told the @entity29			1
that means atomic clocks are keeping more accurate time than our planet 's own rotation , which can speed up and slow down because of tides and changes within the @entity20 's core			1
to get things back in sync , an extra second is periodically added to @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , the world 's benchmark time standard			1
the call is made by scientists at the @entity48 , the agency that keeps tabs on the spinning of the planet			0
it announced the decision to add a leap second this year in a bulletin monday			2
the previous one was in 2012 , but that did n't go entirely smoothly			0
some of the software platforms that underpin a lot of websites did n't know how to cope with the extra second			0
@entity28 wants to ditch leap seconds the issue has become an international sticking point			0
some countries , including the @entity28 , want to get rid of leap seconds altogether , saying they 're too disruptive to precision systems used for navigation , communication and other services			0
but others , like @entity70 , have argued that it 's risky to allow a divergence between the time kept by atomic clocks and that of the @entity20 's rotation			1
an international radiocommunication conference in 2012 put off a decision on the matter until this year			0
in any case , fewer leap seconds are being added nowadays than a few decades ago			1
" @entity20 is n't as slow as it was in the 70s , " said @entity24			2
" relative to the 1970s , it 's sped up a little bit			0
" but still not enough to keep time with the atomic clocks .			2

a " leap second " will be added to the world 's standard time on june 30
the move is to keep clocks in sync with the @entity20 's rotation
