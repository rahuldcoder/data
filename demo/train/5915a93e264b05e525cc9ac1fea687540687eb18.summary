the same elite @entity3 unit that killed @entity4 took part in a daring nighttime rescue in @entity7 of two @entity1 and @entity9 foreign aid workers , a @entity1 official said wednesday			1
the personnel attached to @entity12 , also known as @entity12 , were part of the joint @entity14 that rescued the hostages , @entity10 has confirmed			0
@entity12 , formally known as @entity12 , is one of several units that make up the storied fighting force			1
the @entity3 parachuted into @entity7 on tuesday from fixed - wing aircraft and advanced by foot to the compound where the hostages were held , @entity1 officials said			1
nine gunmen were killed in the strike , the @entity1 military said			0
there were conflicting reports of the number of wounded			0
the @entity3 and the freed hostages left the compound on helicopters , said a @entity1 official not authorized to speak to the media and who asked not to be named			1
the hostages , @entity37 and @entity38 , were abducted in october after they visited humanitarian projects in the northern part of @entity7 , according to a @entity41 who employed them			1
@entity37 and @entity45 were unharmed , the aid group said			0
" it just takes your breath away , their capacity and their bravery and their incredible timing , " vice president @entity46 said wednesday morning , referring to the unit 's capabilities			2
the @entity3 evolved from several specialized @entity3 commando teams that came into being during @entity58 when the @entity1 realized that to invade enemy - held territory in @entity60 , @entity61 and the @entity62 , it needed savvy , quick - thinking fighters who could perform reconnaissance at sea			1
beyond tactical expertise , the @entity3 -- short for @entity66 , @entity67 and land teams -- needed to have extraordinary physical strength			1
the force became known for their jack - of - all - trade skills , able to survey @entity74 's @entity73 disguised as @entity74 nationals in 1945 or conduct demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the @entity80 coast during the @entity81			1
the @entity3 moniker came after president @entity83 spoke about his admiration for special forces troops and his hope that the @entity1 military would better enhance its ability to engage in unconventional warfare , countering guerrilla and clandestine operations			1
there was a new and pressing need for more advanced military techniques during the time			0
among other missions , the @entity3 were deployed to act as advisers and train @entity99 commandos			1
@entity1 special forces rescue @entity7 aid workers @entity102 was the first @entity1 war to be broadcast widely on television and other media , and woven into popular culture for mainstream consumption			1
it solidified the image of the seal as the ultimate tough guy , a reputation burnished by reports of @entity3 ' ability to do face - to - face combat with @entity115 and stories of their work with the @entity118			1
the relationship between @entity1 's spy agency and its elite troops was crucial to gaining real - time intelligence for missions sometimes carried out at the last minute -- perhaps an asset more important now than ever , experts have said			2
the war against @entity127 is just as much about obtaining reliable intelligence as it is winning on the battlefield			0
@entity3 victories have been many			1
during the @entity102 , they performed a covert operation called the @entity133 which captured @entity115 sympathizers			2
in the @entity136 , @entity3 teams conducted missions to counter @entity139 mine - laying boats			1
the first military flag officer to set foot in @entity142 after september 11 , 2001 , was a seal in charge of all special operations for @entity145 , according to the @entity3 history page on its web site			1
the site says @entity3 commanded @entity149 , which oversaw the @entity3 , @entity150 and @entity151 at the beginning of @entity153			1
they carried out more than 75 special reconnaissance and direct action missions , destroyed more than 500,000 pounds of explosives and weapons , identified enemy personnel and conducted operations that searched for terrorists trying to flee the country by sea			0
the largest deployment of @entity3 in the group 's history came during the @entity166 , with @entity3 directing missions that included securing all of the southern oil infrastructures of the @entity169 and the offshore gas and oil terminals , clearing critical waterways so that aid could flow into the country			1
several high - value terrorist targets were captured by the @entity3 , including @entity176 , the alleged mastermind of the murder and mutilation of four @entity180 guards in @entity181 in 2004			1
another high - profile mission came in 2009 when a seal team rescued the @entity1 captain of the cargo ship @entity186 , which had been hijacked by @entity7 pirates off @entity7 's coast			1
@entity3 snipers were on the deck of a ship and fired simultaneously three times , hitting three pirates who were holding the captain			1
of course , the killing of @entity4 during the 2011 @entity196 , @entity197 , raid was a golden moment for the @entity3			1
but not long after that victory , the @entity3 suffered the loss of 17 members when their helicopter was shot down in @entity205 in @entity142 during a mission intended to take out a known @entity208 leader directly responsible for attacks against @entity1 troops , two @entity1 military officials told @entity10 shortly after the august incident			1
the forces were called in to assist another unit on the ground pinned down in a firefight			2
in total , 38 people died in the incident			0
seal training is " the ultimate test for a guy , " said @entity221 , a former seal with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in @entity60 , the @entity224 and @entity142			2
it pushes a soldier mentally , physical and psychologically , testing how well they can work with others given intense pressure and pain			0
seals train between 18 and 24 months , with the pinnacle of training coming during @entity235 , five days in which trainees are constantly cold , hungry , sleep deprived and wet			2
instructors deprive the participants of sleep , then let them hit the rack just long enough for @entity241 sleep to begin , said @entity242 , a former seal who ran the sniper program at the @entity245 and was part of combat missions in @entity248 and @entity142			2
instructors are constantly yelling , " go ahead , quit if you like ! " many do			0
the attrition rate for @entity3 training is about 90 % , @entity221 and @entity242 said			2
most recruits drop out long before @entity235 because they ca n't take the training , which involves running 15 miles , topped with a 2 - mile open water swim and other intense physical conditioning , @entity242 said			2
" every day is like climbing @entity256 , " @entity221 said			0
" you just keep doing what 's in front of you			0
you do n't look up			0
" training instructors make you feel like " you 're part of an @entity262 tribe , " @entity221 said			0
" there 's a lot of back patting and verbal reinforcement			0
you feel like you 're part of something , and you 're doing great things			0
but they definitely let you know when you 're not doing something right			0
" the discipline from seal training was intensely satisfying to @entity275 in his early 20s			2
he had gone to college , and though he was very bright he was spending more time working out than on his classwork			0
four walls and books just were n't his thing			0
despite unimpressive grades , at 23 he got a job working in home mortgages making $ 63,000 a year			0
then one day he read an article about the seals in @entity288			0
" i enlisted in the @entity3 immediately , " @entity221 said			2
" i asked the recruiter , ' what is the fastest track to becoming a seal ? i 'll take that			0
' " though he wo n't discuss specific areas of countries where he 's carried out missions , he said that he normally trained for missions on exact mock - ups of a targeted location .			0
