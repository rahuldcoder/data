-- doing for our oceans what @entity3 has done on land , a team of marine scientists is building up an extraordinary picture of the world 's coral reefs			1
armed with the latest camera technology , the @entity10 is taking marine science into uncharted waters in a bid to transform our understanding of one of the planet 's most diverse , but endangered eco-systems			1
the team has been mapping @entity21 's @entity20 since last september using deep water robots and a revolutionary camera called the @entity24			2
" i think the @entity24 is a game changer , " says lead scientist , @entity25			1
" it 's automating high - definition images at a scale which has not been done before			0
" as well as taking 360 - degree images every three seconds , the camera also records the exact location and direction of a photo using gps , enabling scientists to accurately gauge the health of a reefs over time			1
" so far we are only halfway through @entity10 expeditions , but we 've collected almost a hundred kilometers of transects , " @entity25 added			1
" you just ca n't do that normally			0
you 'd be taking a hundred years to do this with normal divers out there with normal cameras			1
so , getting that technology right has been incredibly important			0
" more than 50,000 photos in total will be taken during expeditions to 20 separate reefs with each image stitched together using special software			0
a picture of reef life is already emerging with many locations available to view on @entity58			0
watch : pulse of the oceans @entity61 was one of the first marine biologists to link coral damage to climate change			1
and while he and others have been monitoring the effects of climate change on reefs for decades , they 've never been able to do it on such a large scale			1
" we do n't have that global baseline for how reefs are doing across the planet			0
coral reefs exist in over 50 countries and they stretch across much of the tropics and subtropics			0
there 's 375,000 kilometers of reef around the world , " says @entity25			1
when the three - year project is completed , reef data will have been boosted considerably , he says			2
monitoring some of the world 's remotest reefs will enable scientists to more accurately answer when , where , and most importantly why coral reefs around the world are declining			0
" one of the parts of the project is to create essentially a databank called ' the @entity94 , ' " says @entity25			2
huge amounts of digital video and physical measurements are being fed into a high - speed storage system , he says , and will be available to scientists all over the world			0
" one of the legacies of the @entity10 is to create essentially that baseline information that everyone has the rights to use and then develop this complex picture of how the world is changing , " he says			2
" this is the sort of science we need to do right now to get a real picture of the risk and vulnerability to things like global change to coral reefs			0
