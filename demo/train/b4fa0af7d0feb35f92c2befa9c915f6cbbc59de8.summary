-- @entity1 is sprawled in a too - small chair in a tiny courtyard in @entity4 , talking to a reporter and trying to catch the early spring sunlight			1
the 43 - year - old @entity1 left @entity7 in january , after spending more than half his life in public office			1
now he 's outside the @entity10 , taking a break after talking up his latest plan to a group of mental health advocates , including former first lady @entity15			1
one thing @entity1 enjoys is talking , and these days , he can say whatever he wants			1
he shouts when he gets excited			0
he curses when he brings up frustrations			0
what he 's talking about now is " moonshot			2
" if @entity1 has his way , 50 years from now the world will remember next week as the first step on one of the great triumphant journeys -- like the call by @entity1 's uncle , president @entity28 , that sent men to the moon			1
@entity1 : brain research is the new ' moon shot ' that call , as @entity1 likes to point out , came may 25 , 1961 -- a half - century ago			1
today , says @entity1 , the race is to inner space , the goal to create a detailed map of the brain in 10 years , with advances toward curing " every kind of brain disease			1
" the role @entity1 plays now would have been hard to imagine back in may of 2006 , when he made his woozy emergence from a green @entity46 convertible with an old @entity49 - @entity48 bumper sticker on the back , which he 'd just crashed into a concrete barrier near the @entity53 @entity52 shortly after 2:30 in the morning			1
a day later , head bowed , @entity1 blamed sleeping pills for the crash and announced he was checking into rehab at the @entity58 in @entity59			1
we did n't know the whole story then , that the congressman had already been to rehab a half - dozen times			0
as is often the case , there had been hints			0
shoving a security guard at the @entity68			0
a fight on a yacht , that brought a visit from the @entity72			0
another boat , and another fight , this time with the rental company			0
@entity1 has acknowledged a trip to rehab for cocaine abuse way back in 1985 , as a 17 - year - old high school senior in @entity79 , @entity80			1
along the way he also got a diagnosis of bipolar illness , although he now says recent testing suggests he is not bipolar but has a different , unspecified disorder			0
at the time of the infamous @entity89 crash , @entity86 was a @entity90 congressman from @entity59			0
he was also a recovering alcoholic , who had his last drink in 1981 , shortly before an unpleasant encounter with some @entity93 , @entity94 , police officers			0
" i called @entity1 that morning , and told him i knew exactly what he was going through			1
and if he wanted me to come to him and talk , i would			0
" @entity86 had worked with @entity1 on mental health legislation but was not a close confidant			1
that changed over the next few weeks , as he paid repeated visits to the @entity58			0
" we really formed a bond of friendship , and got to be close friends , " says @entity86			0
the former congressman , who became @entity1 's sponsor at @entity111 , says he 's proud his friend was so open about the public crackup			1
" @entity1 got up there and told the truth			1
he let it all hang out , so to speak			0
and that 's why he has been able to recover			2
" after getting home from the @entity58 , most politicians -- heck , pretty much any politician you can think of -- would have run from the attention			0
@entity1 seemed to embrace it			1
by 2008 , he was leading the drive for " parity , " the requirement that mental ailments -- addiction included -- must be covered by insurance companies , along with other kinds of illness			1
president @entity132 signed the bill into law that year			0
says @entity86 , one of the bill 's original sponsors a decade earlier : " without @entity1 and his father ( sen. @entity138 ) as catalysts , we never would have passed the legislation			1
" in a @entity142 hotel suite in early april , @entity1 explained his vision of parity			1
" if you have diabetes and have a chemical imbalance so you need more insulin , you do n't get any questions about it			0
but if you need a neurotransmitter -- more serotonin , or dopamine -- then ( people ) look at that as something askew , as if the brain is n't part of the body , " says @entity1 , his voice rising			1
" i mean , we 're in modern times and people are still treating this illness , mental illness , as if it 's back in the @entity165			1
" if 2008 was a year of professional triumph , it also brought devastating personal news : that @entity1 's father was fighting a brain tumor			1
" he gave me an implicit message when he asked me to be around him at the end of his life , " says @entity1 , who calls the final time with his father " the most important year of my life			1
" as @entity1 recalls it now , " the only thing that mattered to ( my dad ) when he was alone at the end of his life was not being alone and being surrounded by the people he loved the most , who he knew loved him the most			2
" the strain took a toll on @entity1			2
two months before his father 's death , he checked into rehab again			2
when @entity138 died in august 2009 , @entity1 took it hard			2
six months later , he announced he would not run for re-election			0
he seems to have walked away on his own terms			0
" he would have won re-election easily , " according to @entity192 , a political scientist who has followed @entity1 's career closely since the early 1990s			1
incidentally , @entity1 's departure in january marked the first time in 58 years that there is no @entity1 in the national government -- no congressman , senator or president			1
@entity1 says he was tired of struggling with the stress of public office			2
" i have put certain days together , and managed effectively to live and fight for another day legislatively , " says @entity1			1
but , " i 'm looking to live more than just surviving			1
i 'm looking to live a life that 's fuller in sobriety			1
i could function ( while still in office ) , but that 's not all i want to do			2
" he 's seized the opportunity			2
come july , @entity1 will be married , to @entity209 , a sixth - grade history teacher he met after , yes , another talk			2
it was about special education , the cause championed by his aunts @entity215 , who founded the special @entity216 , and @entity217 , who received the @entity218 for promoting the artistic talents of people with disabilities			0
@entity209 's father , a special education teacher , had a ticket to the event but could n't go			2
as @entity1 says , " the rest is history			2
" @entity86 , his aa sponsor , says his old friend is happier than ever			0
" he was so close to his dad			0
they used to talk five or six times a day			0
losing him left a huge void in his life			0
and now here comes @entity209			0
" @entity1 glows when he talks about his fianc√©e , or about reading bedtime stories to her 3 - year - old daughter			2
but he 's all impatient enthusiasm when talk comes back around to @entity240 , or as next week 's conference is officially called , " one mind for @entity243			1
" the surroundings will be modest , an academic - style conference in @entity142			0
then again , president @entity1 's original 1961 call for a space race was prosaic too , the last of several budget requests in a businesslike address to @entity7 four months after taking office			1
what we remember better is the stirring speech he gave at @entity255 the following year			0
" we choose to go to the moon in this decade and to do the other things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard , " the president famously declared			0
his nephew , @entity1 , grins at the challenge ahead			2
" this is a thousand moon shots in order of complexity , and that makes it all the more challenging			0
for our generation , this is our chance to make the difference			0

former @entity53 rep. @entity1 launching new effort to map the human brain
" @entity240 " will work toward curing " every kind of brain disease "
@entity1 's own addiction , mental health issue drive passion
