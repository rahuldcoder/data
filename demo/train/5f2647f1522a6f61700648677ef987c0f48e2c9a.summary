-- @entity1 flowed tuesday from two @entity3 volcanoes , with authorities placing both on the second - highest alert levels because " sudden explosions ... are possible with little or no warning			1
" the volcanoes are @entity10 and @entity11 , both in the @entity13 range southwest of mainland @entity3			1
the @entity14 has issued a watch due to heightened activity , plus an orange code regarding how they might affect planes in the area			0
at @entity10 , the higher of the two summits at 8,261 feet , the observatory reported " eruptive activity " that followed " an increase in seismic activity			1
" @entity1 has been spotted about 0.3 of a mile ( half a kilometer ) down the volcano 's north flank			2
unlike @entity11 , @entity10 is not on an island but rather is connected to the @entity3 mainland			1
the 5,676 - foot high @entity11 is about 350 miles to the southwest			1
it has 100 - meter wide swath of lava extending about 1 mile down its southeastern flank , according to the @entity14			0
five climbers killed in @entity35 after deadly volcanic ash blast that organization noted @entity11 could produce ash clouds rising more than 20,000 feet above sea level			0
beyond any impact on fish , wildlife and humans , large ash clouds could negatively impact air travel			0
" they are very similar , and both have the ability to erupt , " @entity46 , a scientist from the @entity47 , told @entity0			2
after " eruptive activity " last year at the @entity11 volcano , @entity52 scientist @entity51 noted that 90 % of air freight from @entity56 to @entity57 and @entity58 flies over @entity3 airspace , and hundreds of flights fly through @entity62 's air space daily			1
why some travelers seek out world 's most dangerous locales " we think of the @entity13 as being remote and desolate " @entity46 explained , " but when you come up to 30,000 feet we are talking about 20 to 30,000 people there every single day			2
" @entity46 described @entity10 as " one of the most historically active volcanoes in the @entity70			1
@entity11 is also " very active , " having last had a large eruption in 2001			2
a complicating and potentially troubling factor for @entity11 is it 's not monitored with ground instruments , like @entity10			1
years of declining budgets have made adding such technology , to such a remote locale , increasingly challenging			0
. and all of it means it takes longer for anyone to realize @entity11 erupts , which could prove hazardous for any planes flying through			0
" for instance , ... on may 4 , we had a sizable eruption , and we were n't even aware for about 40 minutes , " @entity46 said			0
imposing central @entity86 volcano spews ash skyward			0

new : both volcanoes are historically very active , a @entity47 scientist says
there 's " eruptive activity " at the @entity10 volcano , an 8,261 - foot summit linked to @entity3 mainland
@entity1 is flowing there as well as at the @entity11 volcano , also part of the @entity13 range
watches are out for both
