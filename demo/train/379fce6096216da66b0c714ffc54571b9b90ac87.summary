@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is an environmentalist and the chairman and chief scientist of the @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
@entity3 founded the @entity6 in 1982 to promote energy efficiency			1
@entity3 , who participated in @entity8 in 2006 , has advocated the " soft energy path , " which promotes efficiency and renewable energy			1
he has also propagated concepts based on energy conservation , efficiency as well as the generation of energy at or near the site where it is actually used			2
the author of 29 books , who has also advised 19 heads of state , @entity3 talks about the current state of renewable energy			1
@entity2 : do you think the climate change debate puts too much emphasis on alternative energy and not enough on energy efficiency ? @entity3 : yes			1
they 're both important and synergistic , but efficiency is generally larger , cheaper , and faster			0
@entity2 : you 've said that energy efficiency is n't costly , it 's actually profitable for businesses -- why do n't businesses focus more on this area ? @entity37 : smart businesses are raising their energy efficiency by about five to 15 percent per year			1
inattentive businesses -- distracted by other matters , or forgetting that saved overhead , even if it 's a small fraction of total costs , drops straight to the bottom line , or lacking the leadership and attention to turn the many implementation barriers into business opportunities -- suffer high costs , increased risks , and lost competitive advantage			2
@entity2 : what are the most promising energy - saving technologies ? @entity37 : there 's no short list of technologies ; energy efficiency can be greatly increased in essentially every use and sector , including uncompromised but safer cars , trucks , and planes , with three times the current efficiency ; buildings saving 80 to 90 percent of their energy and costing less to build ; and often several-fold more efficient factories			1
overall , the @entity69 could save half its oil and gas and three - fourths of its electricity at a cost equivalent to about an eighth of their price			0
@entity6 's latest $ 30 billion worth of efficiency redesigns in 29 sectors have consistently found about 30 to 60 percent savings on retrofit , with two to three year paybacks , and about 40 to 90 percent savings in new facilities , with nearly always lower capital cost			1
moreover , energy - saving technologies keep improving faster than they 're applied , so efficiency is an ever larger and cheaper resource			2
the big surprise is that integrative design -- not a technology , but a way of combining technologies -- can often make very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings			1
for more on how to achieve this , read my @entity97 lecture notes			0
@entity2 : why do you oppose nuclear power ? @entity37 : new nuclear plants are so extraordinarily costly that they would save about two to 11 times less carbon dioxide emission per dollar , about 20 to 40 times slower than investing the same money in efficient use of electricity or in " micropower " ( co-generation and distributed renewables )			1
these competitors already provide the majority of the world 's new electrical services because they cost less and have lower financial risk than central thermal power stations do			0
indeed , micropower generates more electricity than nuclear power does , and has lately been adding 30 to 41 times more capacity per year			0
the claimed ' nuclear revival ' is not actually happening because , despite new @entity69 subsidies rivaling or exceeding new nuclear plants ' total cost , no private investors have been willing to finance them anywhere in the world ; they 're bought only by governments using public funds			0
nuclear power has other serious problems -- most importantly , facilitating and cloaking the spread of nuclear bombs -- but since it 's unbuildable in a free market , it fails before one reaches those issues			0
@entity2 : what can we do as individuals in our everyday lives to waste less energy ? @entity37 : turn off stuff we 're not using			2
combine trips , bike , walk , carpool , use public transit			0
get the most efficient energy - using devices -- vehicles , appliances , lights -- we can find			2
organize efficiency improvements in your workplace and community			0
vote mindfully with your ballot , actions , and dollars .			0
