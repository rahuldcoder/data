-- on wednesday night , on a small patch of lawn in central @entity7 , generations of people bearing affection and gratitude will gather to say one last goodbye to miss @entity9			1
that 's what she was called her entire adult life , and that 's the way she wanted it			0
@entity17 was 85 when she died in the waning days of september , as a new school year was getting started			2
she was a young woman just out of @entity19 of the @entity20 and the @entity21 when , in 1947 , she commenced her life 's work : teaching kindergarten in @entity25 , @entity7			1
for 32 years , miss @entity9 would greet new , nervous , excited groups of 5 - year - olds in her classroom at the south end of the first - floor hallway of @entity31 on @entity32			1
that is where the memorial gathering will be held on wednesday night : on the lawn right outside the window of her old classroom			2
and the reason the town will gather for miss @entity9 ... well , if you have ever lived in a community in which one person 's devotion to the town , and to its residents , is a part of everyone 's memory , then you will understand			1
miss @entity9 never forgot a child 's face or a child 's name , even when the boys and girls had grown older and had children and grandchildren of their own			1
how she did it , i do n't know			0
she knew your name , she knew your parents ' names , she knew your brothers ' and sisters ' names -- 20 , 30 , 40 years after you had left her kindergarten class , she knew			1
" she was everything to this town , " said @entity66 , an attorney who lives in @entity25 and who was a child in miss @entity9 's kindergarten class in 1969			1
" she was a part of the town 's life for as long as many of us can ever remember			2
and she remembered each one of us			2
in a world where relationships can be fast and fleeting , that matters			1
for generations , men and women who had once been her students would sometimes move away , pursuing jobs elsewhere or starting families in other parts of the country			0
when they would return for a visit years later and run into miss @entity9 as she walked around town , the sight of her face and the sound of her welcoming voice made it official : they were home			1
she dealt with the ups and downs that are a part of a long life with a smile and the will to keep on going			0
after she retired , there was an item in a local newspaper saying that the school had decided to have crossing guards at @entity32 and @entity112			2
there had always been patrol boys and girls at the other end of the block -- at @entity32 and @entity118 , where there was a stoplight			0
but now the school was looking for adults to help out at the unguarded far end , and the story in the paper announced a time and place for a meeting for volunteers			0
miss @entity9 went to the meeting			1
she was the only one to show up			0
and for the next 27 years , as she grew old , she was on that corner every day , helping the children get safely to school			0
she was there in the rain and she was there in the snow , and once i asked her if it would n't be better for her to stay home in such foul weather			0
no , she said ; that 's when it was most important for her to be on duty , when visibility was bad and accidents more likely			0
in 1952 , in miss @entity9 's kindergarten class , i met @entity147 , who would become my friend for the next 52 years -- my oldest friend in life			1
miss @entity9 watched the friendship begin			1
when @entity147 died of cancer in 2004 , and his wife and daughter asked me to deliver the eulogy at his funeral , it was a very difficult day to get through			2
at the end of the service , as i followed his casket up the aisle , i felt a hand reach out from one of the seats , and hold my own hand			0
she never married ; if you read the formal obituaries last week , you might have surmised that she never had children			0
she had hundreds of children ; hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds , who she never forgot , and who never forgot her			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

@entity175 says a *favorite* kindergarten teacher died ; her service is wednesday
he says the teacher , miss @entity9 , was much beloved and bound to her @entity7 town
he says she remembered names , was a *touchstone* for many ; later was crossing guard
@entity175 : in a *fragmented* world of fleeting relationships , miss @entity9 mattered
