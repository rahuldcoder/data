@entity0 , @entity1 -- if he decides to run for president , @entity1 gov. @entity3 will need to push back against the inevitable pressure that he will encounter to move to the right			1
@entity3 has emerged as one of the most exciting potential candidates for the @entity7 , a @entity7 who has been popular in a blue state and who has demonstrated the kind of straight talk with the media that voters find appealing			1
in @entity1 , a recent poll shows 30 % of the @entity17 vote supporting @entity3			1
his willingness to take on the barons of his own party , without capitulating to his @entity17 opponents , has bolstered the impression that he would try to break the gridlock that has bogged down @entity25 , much as @entity26 did as a presidential candidate in 2008			1
his emphasis on budgetary conservatism rather than social and cultural conservatism also has the potential to win over moderate voters			2
the conventional wisdom will quickly push him to placate the right , even before he officially starts running , just in terms of what he does in a second term as governor of @entity1			2
for decades , pundits and experts have constantly warned that the nature of the presidential primary system means that a candidate has to move far to the right within the @entity7 if he or she is going to win over voters who tend come out for these contests , voters who veer toward the extremes of the political spectrum			1
yet the conventional wisdom tends to overstate the political benefits that @entity7 presidential candidates derive from shifting to the right and downplays the damage that is caused by such moves			1
at the most basic level , moderate @entity7 , often governors , who try to dramatically transform their images for primary voters are usually not very effective			1
conservatives do n't walk away feeling as if they are true bedfellows , and the rest of the voters are left to wonder how hard the candidate will really fight for a new agenda that crosses the partisan divide			0
democrats are also given a treasure chest of controversial statements to paint their opponent as an extremist			0
in 2012 , former @entity72 gov. @entity71 tried to convince the right that he was a true conservative with hardline statements on health care and taxes that clearly contradicted his own political record in the @entity72			0
rather than running on his record , @entity71 started to run away from it and tried to pretend he was a very different kind of candidate , a politician who was " severely conservative , " as he later said			0
in the end , however , @entity7 primary voters did not pick @entity71 because he was a far - right conservative but because he appeared to be the most viable candidate for the general election			1
but by the time of the @entity7 convention , @entity71 's flip - flopping made it hard to sell himself to voters as something different , and @entity26 pounded away on the conservative statements that came out of the primaries as evidence that @entity71 really was a right - wing conservative , more out of the tradition of @entity99 than the tradition of @entity101			1
the story of a @entity7 governor in a blue state who had been able to work with @entity17 to solve big problems like health care was impossible to tell			1
@entity3 should realize that he will never be a sen. @entity108 , even to right - wing voters			2
what he will be able to sell to them in the primaries is the claim that his straight - talking , pragmatic approach to @entity7 politics will do better in the general election against a formidable candidate like @entity118 and would probably do more to actually advance the party as well as legislation that matters to those who support the @entity7			2
this is his best argument for the primaries and for the general election			0
the @entity7 who have done best in presidential elections have steered clear of the right and offered themes that united their coalition and even attracted some @entity17			1
in 1968 and 1972 , @entity128 focused on the " @entity129 " of @entity130 who were unhappy with the anti-war protests taking place in the colleges and the urban riots			0
his main message , one that had broad appeal , was that the war in @entity139 was a disaster and that he would do better			0
@entity141 , though closely aligned with the conservative movement , built his campaign in 1980 around the themes of anti-communism and anti-taxation -- as well as attacks on @entity148			0
in 1988 , @entity149 did the same			0
his son @entity150 promised voters an agenda of " compassionate conservatism " in 2000 and national security in 2004			0
even the @entity7 who gained the nomination and went on to lose in the general election tended to be the moderates in the primaries , not the candidates of the hard right			1
in 1976 , president @entity161 fended off a strong challenge from @entity141 , who at that point made little effort to hide his right - wing allegiance			0
in 1992 , president @entity149 stifled a challenge from former @entity128 speechwriter @entity168 , who made a hard pitch to social and cultural conservatives , while in 1996 , @entity7 picked senate majority leader @entity171 over right - wing candidates like @entity168			2
in 2008 , it was maverick and bipartisan bridge builder sen. @entity176 who won the nomination , a candidacy hurt only when he made his appeals to the right and undercut his greatest virtues as a politician , and in 2012 , it was @entity71 rather than the huge cast of conservatives who filled the airwaves			0
in all of these cases , it is true that the candidates appealed to the right during key primaries like @entity192 , but it remains far from clear that their victories rested on these kinds of obvious moments of political posturing as much as the overall viability of their candidacy for november			0
the costs outweighed the benefits			0
the point is that in presidential campaigns , moderation can be a powerful tool for @entity7 candidates			1
@entity3 has made a lot of progress over the past year in positioning himself as a potential candidate			2
he should look at the historical record before taking the bait to shift right			0
if @entity3 makes too many statements that undermine his image , he might very well hand the next @entity17 candidate a victory before the campaigns even get under way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : idea that @entity7 candidates must tack to the right to gain support is myth
he says @entity3 's chances at presidency would be stronger if he stayed in center
@entity3 appeals to @entity17 voters ; running to the right would lose them , @entity223 says
@entity223 : the most *successful* @entity7 presidential candidates have pushed moderate themes
