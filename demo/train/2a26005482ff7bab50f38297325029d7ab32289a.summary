@entity0 , @entity1 -- fresh explosions rang out early tuesday near @entity0 , hours after @entity4 president @entity3 held talks with @entity7 and signalled he was ready to accept an @entity9 plan for a cease - fire			1
around 12:45 a.m. tuesday , a pair of large blasts were heard about five minutes apart , as jets flew over the capital of @entity0			1
a @entity1 government official said the first strike hit @entity17 , a former military turned construction site about 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) from the city center			2
there was no immediate indication of where the second explosion occurred			0
nor was there an immediate response from @entity27 , which has conducted regular strikes as part of its stated mission to halt @entity1 leader @entity7 's forces from killing innocent civilians			1
hours before the blasts , @entity3 emerged from a meeting with the longtime @entity1 strongman convinced that @entity7 was ready for an end to hostilities , including such airstrikes and the ongoing fight with the @entity42 - based opposition movement			1
but he gave no indication that @entity7 was prepared to step aside , as rebel leaders have insisted is their primary demand			2
" brother leader took the position today that he is ready to implement the decision of the @entity9 ( that ) there must be a cease - fire , " @entity3 told a scrum of reporters on the tarmac at @entity0 's @entity49 before boarding a jet			1
" the view is that that must include -- bombing by @entity27 must also come to an end , " he said in the news conference , which was broadcast on @entity1 state television			1
@entity3 added that @entity7 said any cease - fire must apply to all parties , " but also , he makes the point that : let the @entity1 people be given a chance to talk among themselves			1
and therefore , he 's ready to implement the road map of the @entity9			0
" unlike some other world leaders , @entity3 has not called for the longtime @entity1 leader to step down			1
neither has @entity3 's @entity71 nor the @entity9 , which he was representing and which @entity7 once led			1
in fact , the @entity9 has criticized the @entity27 airstrikes			2
in april , @entity3 led an @entity9 delegation to @entity0 , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that @entity7 had agreed , in principle , to the @entity9 's " road map " proposal for peace			1
but @entity7 continued his attacks and the @entity1 opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years			1
a government official said @entity1 prime minister @entity86 also attended monday 's meeting			2
@entity88 greeted @entity3 upon his arrival at the airport , where dozens of @entity7 supporters carried posters , some of which said , " may the leader be victorious " and " thanks for great @entity4			1
" the @entity9 has helped mediate peace talks before , including ones in @entity98 and @entity99 that left the ruling powers in control			0
it was not clear whether @entity3 used the opportunity to press @entity7 for information on the whereabouts of @entity4 freelance photographer @entity105			1
@entity105 has been missing in @entity1 since april and is believed dead			2
@entity4 has said it got assurances from @entity1 that the journalist was alive			1
but a @entity1 government spokesman has said his whereabouts were unknown			2
" we never had him with us at any stage , " spokesman @entity111 has said			0
the meeting came as @entity7 's grip on power appeared to continue to loosen			0
eight generals from his army have defected to @entity119 , the @entity119 @entity118 told @entity2 monday			0
the generals were accompanied by more than 100 @entity1 soldiers , a senior @entity119 official with firsthand knowledge of , and responsibility for , the operation said			1
the @entity1 crossed their country 's border into @entity130 , where they were met by @entity119 intelligence agents , the official said			0
@entity119 announced monday that it will open a consulate tuesday in the rebel - held eastern city of @entity42			0
also monday , the first locally based television station to operate in @entity1 since the start of the revolution was to begin broadcasting from the rebel stronghold of @entity42			2
the station was founded by @entity141 , who later was one of five journalists killed in the conflict			0
" @entity7 forces assassinated him for highlighting to the rest of the world the atrocities committed by the @entity7 regime , " said @entity144 , who was to open the station 's broadcast from the city 's courthouse			0
in recent weeks , @entity7 has been seen in public only rarely as @entity27 has stepped up attacks against his sprawling @entity156			2
@entity27 secretary general @entity157 said monday that @entity7 's " reign of terror is coming to an end			1
" " he is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , " @entity157 said during a speech in @entity161			0
" even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting			0
" @entity157 also said @entity27 has made " significant progress " in its @entity1 operation			2
@entity27 said monday it has conducted 3,385 strike sorties in @entity1 since march			1
" we have seriously degraded @entity7 's ability to kill his own people , " @entity157 said in his speech			0
" we have prevented more massacres in @entity171 and elsewhere across the country , and we are saving lives every day			0
" the @entity27 - led bombing campaign began in march after the @entity175 authorized the use of any means necessary -- short of occupation -- to protect civilians from attacks by @entity7 's forces			1
on sunday , @entity1 opposition forces continued to fend off attacks near the rebel - held port city of @entity171			0
but rebel leader @entity186 said over the weekend that the opposition movement is running out of money even as it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically			0
" we are going through a financial crisis , " said @entity186 , chairman of the @entity42 - based @entity190			0
in a speech in @entity195 , @entity196 , the @entity193 ' top human rights official noted monday " the brutality and magnitude of measures " taken by the @entity1 government			2
the government 's actions have been " shocking , " @entity193 @entity202 @entity201 said , criticizing the " outright disregard for basic human rights			0
" @entity2 's @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
