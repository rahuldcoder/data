-- when we think about asylum , the picture that most people draw in their heads is of some persecuted person crossing a border to a safe country and pleading his or her case			0
@entity12 journalists who have walked across international bridges into the @entity14 , fearing drug cartel reprisals , come to mind			0
or the @entity18 athletes who during tournaments abroad decide to defect , and ask for asylum			0
this is the traditional , and most common way , to request asylum			0
but as the latest twist in the @entity24 case shows , there are rare times when asylum is granted to someone who has yet to reach their safe haven			1
@entity30 's decision this week to grant asylum to @entity24 was celebrated as a victory by his supporters , but the @entity36 founder 's conundrum remains unchanged			1
for the foreseeable future , he is stuck inside the @entity30 embassy in @entity40			2
@entity30 may have granted asylum to the man inside their embassy , but the @entity44 does n't recognize it			1
at issue are divergent views on the concept of diplomatic asylum -- a nation 's granting of asylum to someone not inside its territory			1
the concept of diplomatic asylum is as old as the practice of having permanent embassies in foreign countries			1
it is tied closely with the practice of diplomatic immunity , which is more well known			0
but controversies over countries using diplomatic asylum to protect people wanted for crimes led to the practice falling out of favor , according to a @entity68 report devoted to the subject in 1975			1
from the 19th century onward , the practice of diplomatic asylum virtually disappeared in @entity72 , while it continued to grow in @entity73			1
the result is that today , the view in most of world is that diplomatic asylum , in essence , does not exist			1
the exception is @entity73 , where some legal writers even grant diplomatic asylum the status of a human right , the @entity68 report says			1
one last tidbit of academic dryness before considering the @entity24 case : the prevailing view that diplomatic asylum is not part of accepted international law was settled in a case between @entity92 and @entity93 before the @entity94 in 1950			1
@entity95 , a @entity92 , led an unsuccessful rebellion in @entity92 and was wanted by authorities there			0
he hid in the @entity93 embassy in @entity99 and asked for , and received asylum from @entity93			0
@entity92 , however , refused to grant safe passage			0
sound familiar ? the court ruled that diplomatic asylum is not recognized unless treaties or other agreements are in place between countries			1
so today , " in general international law there is n't actually a right to grant diplomatic asylum , or at least other states are n't required to respect it , " said @entity108 , an international law expert at the @entity109			1
what it means for @entity24 is that @entity30 's declaration might not do anything to help him			2
in fact , @entity108 said , under international law , if the @entity44 officially requests @entity30 to hand over @entity24 , @entity30 would be legally obligated to do so			1
@entity44 has made it clear that it will not provide safe passage and intends to extradite @entity24 to @entity125 , but it is unclear if the government has sent a formal request for him			2
the @entity44 's position has been to negotiate a solution			2
a negotiated solution staved off a similar diplomatic drama between the @entity14 and @entity134 this year			0
the blind @entity134 activist @entity135 had escaped house arrest and sought refuge inside the @entity14 embassy			0
unlike the @entity24 case , however , @entity135 did not ask for asylum and none was granted			2
instead , @entity142 invited @entity135 to study there , and @entity134 agreed to let him go			0
with negotiations apparently deadlocked between @entity30 and @entity44 , it is uncertain how long @entity24 will remain holed up inside the embassy while @entity125 awaits to question him over claims of rape and sexual molestation			1
" these cases can go on for years if there is n't some settlement			0
it 's happened in the past , " @entity108 said			0
the @entity92 who sought asylum from the @entity93 embassy in 1950 lived there for five years			0
meanwhile , some experts questioned the validity of the arguments that @entity30 used to grant asylum			2
@entity30 's decision was based on the belief that @entity125 would eventually turn @entity24 over to the @entity14 , and that his life would be at risk once in @entity14 custody , former @entity30 foreign minister @entity165 told @entity0 en @entity166			2
" that is making a hypothesis on top of a hypothesis , and to justify a decision on that is not very strong , " he said			0
the purpose of an embassy is to maintain ties with other countries , but as long as @entity24 remains in limbo , " every day it will become a greater obstacle in their efforts toward good relations			2

@entity30 granted asylum to @entity24 , but the @entity44 does not recognize it
diplomatic asylum is not a right under general international law
the standoff could extend *indefinitly*
