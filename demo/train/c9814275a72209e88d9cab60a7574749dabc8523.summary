@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 always knew he would make a major impact as a musician			1
an accomplished drummer , he was at the top of the local music scene in 1994 , winning local drumming competitions and performing regularly at hot spots in the @entity11			1
he was 23 years old , and planned to move to @entity12 , or perhaps @entity13 , to launch his music career			2
then one night , everything changed			2
heading home from a late night gig , @entity16 fell asleep at the wheel			2
" the car flipped over five or six times , that 's what they told me , " he said			2
" they said i looked like something out of a horror movie ... they had to use the jaws of life to snip through the car doors to get me out			2
" he was lucky to be alive			2
but then came the bad news			2
" [ the doctors ] said ' you 're probably never going to walk and probably never going to play the drums again , ' " he remembered			2
" it was like a nuclear bomb was dropped on my life			0
i thought my career was over			0
" the accident had left him paralyzed from the chest down			1
@entity3 refused to give up his passion from drumming			1
within a few years , he regained the use of his arms			0
but he never got back the use of his legs			0
to this day , @entity3 remains in a wheelchair			1
that has hampered his ability to play a drum set which requires a foot pedal to operate the bass drum and the hi - hat cymbal			1
for a while , he got by with a special setup that triggered a bass drum noise when he hit a certain pad with a drumstick			1
that did n't cut it for @entity3			1
so he invented a system that allows him to trigger a bass drum sound while continuing to play the snares , cymbals , and the rest of the drum set			1
@entity3 uses a mouthpiece trigger provided to him by @entity72 , a company with a line of products aimed at helping people with disabilities -- particularly quadriplegics -- operate computers			1
@entity3 rigged the mouthpiece to control tiny rubber sensors under each cymbal			1
anytime he sucks on the mouthpiece while simultaneously hitting one of the cymbals , a bass drum noise is triggered from a small subwoofer situated directly inside the bass drum casing			1
he can move the sensors under any of part of the drum set			1
" this is over 10 years in the making , " he said , smiling behind his state - of - the - art drum set			1
despite his hard work , @entity3 said he has no desire to patent his invention			1
" if people want to know how to build their own triggers , then , by golly , they can just contact me , " he said			0
" i 'll give them the information for free			0
encouragement should n't come at a price			0
" one glance at @entity16 's @entity107 inbox reveals a worldwide fan base many of whom are exactly that : encouraged			0
he reads over one letter from someone who had their legs amputated last year : " thanks for being my inspiration			0
" another one reads , " i 'm back playing rock and roll , using some of your techniques			0
thanks for being my inspiration			0
" another fan writes , " thanks for your effort in helping change the paradigm in the music industry			0
" that particular " thank you " note is special for @entity3			1
getting the music industry to include more disabled musicians -- to look " between the wheels " of his wheelchair as he puts it -- is exactly what he aims to do			0
" there 's so many musicians who are disabled who do n't get the chance to play live , " he said			0
" so i want to tell them to knock on doors and encourage the music industry to be willing to hire a person with a disability			0
" and he seems to be on his way			0
on april 28 , @entity3 debuted his mouthpiece technology -- accompanied digitally by music he composed himself --- for the very first time during a private event at @entity0 ' famous @entity151			1
to him , it was his first step to getting back on the road , doing what he loves more than anything , and at the same time urging others in similar situations to pursue their dreams and change the world			0
not surprisingly , the evening was capped off with a standing ovation			0
now that he 's made his invention public , @entity3 said he plans to show others how to create the technology through " innovative drumming clinics " that could grow into a music tour with other artists			1
" people need encouragement , " @entity3 said , " and if i can be in the position to help someone else , that 's just an honor you ca n't take lightly			2

a car accident in 1994 left drummer @entity3 a quadriplegic
@entity3 used a set - up that required him to hit a pad to trigger the bass drum and hi - hat cymbal , normally controlled by the feet
that took away from his drumming , so he invented a way to trigger the bass and hi - hat using a mouthpiece
he debuted his invention at an april *concert* in @entity0
