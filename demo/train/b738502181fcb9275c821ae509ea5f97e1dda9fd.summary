-- at the annual rattlesnake roundup in @entity5 , @entity6 , in early march , @entity2 sponsors and volunteers slaughtered 3,890 pounds of rattlesnakes			1
the event is billed as " fun for the whole family , " and children take their turns to skin a snake , and afterward , press their hands covered with snake blood onto a wall of handprints			1
the @entity2 , short for the @entity19 @entity18 , bills itself as a group that gives young people " the tools they need to build the bridges of success			1
" the @entity5 branch has been holding what it calls " @entity29 's @entity28 " for 56 years on the first weekend in march , and the tool for success that it teaches young people is that it 's fun to kill and torture animals			2
for weeks or even months , rattlesnakes are stored in crowded barrels until it 's roundup time			1
the snakes that have not suffocated under their kin arrive hungry , dehydrated , and sick from gasoline that was sprayed into their burrows to flush them out			1
after a tour of the roundup , @entity45 wrote an article for " @entity49 " in which he recalls noticing " ... an unusual smell ... like bad cologne and also like something gone bad			2
" throughout the tour the smell keeps coming back to him , he writes , until he realizes what it is : " ... the musk , feces , and blood of a thousand terrified snakes , half - covered with sprays of deodorant from @entity2 working the pits			1
" in the " research pit , " snakes are weighed , measured , and probed to determine sex			1
many have their venom extracted in the " milking pit , " ostensibly for scientific research and antivenin production			2
however , according to the @entity73 , which specializes in venom research and education , abused or gassed snakes " are not viable ... considering how dangerous gasoline is , venom produced from snakes collected this way should never be used in any product that might be used in humans ... " one might add that it is unwise to eat these snakes at the popular snake - meat - eating contest and barbecue cook - off			1
in the " safety and handling demonstration pit , " a @entity2 walks among hundreds of snakes , carelessly kicking them aside , trying to provoke them to rattle and strike			1
when this fails , the @entity2 may select a snake for special treatment			1
a rattlesnake 's face gives almost no clue to its experience of fear or pain , making it hard for most people to feel empathy			2
but if people are willing to take a closer look at the rattlesnake trying to hide its head under its coils after being tormented and having given up his fight to survive , they might understand what it 's going through			1
just like people , rattlesnakes have fully developed central nervous systems , but they lack vocal chords and can not cry out in pain			1
finally , in the " skinning pit , " snakes are held down on a tree stump and decapitated with one or more machete blows			1
schoolchildren watch from the galleries above			2
according to @entity45 , " each machete blow brought a mixture of exclamations and laughter			2
... blood from this and other killing sessions covered the floor and the skinning table in clots of gore , and twisting rattlesnake bodies were hung to be gutted and skinned , still moving as if trying to get away			0
" @entity45 notes that one child asked to pet a beheaded snake , and a pit member held up a snake 's body to oblige the child			0
if children learn that it 's ok to hurt and kill animals for fun , what is to stop them from doing the same to people ? what are they learning about the value of life , and how does this fit in with the @entity2 philosophy ? psychologists say that people who murder often tortured animals as children ; there is a link between violence against animals and violence against people			1
photos from @entity5 roundups are particularly chilling because the facial expressions of participants are a mix of hatred , fear and pleasure			0
in one , a man holds an automatic nail gun and has a snake pinned to a chopping block , looking as if he wants to cause the snake as much agony as possible			0
another photo shows beauty pageant winner miss @entity181 2014 in her crown and sash , holding long snake tongs in the air , with a huge rattlesnake clamped at the end , his head bloodied			0
miss @entity181 hangs back , her face contorted in fear , her mouth open in a scream			0
she is 16 years old			0
how can such abuse of an animal be anything but damaging to this young lady 's spirit ? the traditional roundups of @entity5 need to end			0
the @entity2 could create a festival that raises money for the community and celebrates the rattlesnake as an icon of the @entity207			1
in other states where rattlesnakes live , the transition from roundup to wildlife festival has already happened			2
one crucial purpose of rattlesnake and wildlife festivals should be to show children that all animals must be treated with kindness and respect			0
with young people being drawn to environmental science , conservation and wildlife biology , festivals provide networking opportunities and contact with professionals in these fields of interest			0
not far from @entity5 , on march 8 and 9 , 2014 , the inaugural @entity230 was held at the @entity231 in @entity232			0
the animals on display were not taken from the wild , but bred in captivity , and handled with care so they were not stressed			0
there were demonstrations of the proper and humane technique for extracting venom			0
and children could leave their handprints in bright , colorful paint rather than snake blood			2
one visitor said , " it was very nice to be in a comfortable and safe environment with venomous animals so close by			0
and to be around so many people who truly appreciated them			0
the ( traditional ) roundups are tense and stressful , but this was really nice			0

@entity255 : *4,000* pounds of rattlesnakes slaughtered at @entity2 event
@entity259 : snakes are sick , they suffocate ; hundreds are in piles , tormented
she says kids skin decapitated snakes ; then press bloody handprints on a wall
