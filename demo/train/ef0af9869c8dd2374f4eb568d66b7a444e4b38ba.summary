-- " and there we were ... " that phrase begins many stories told by wildland firefighters			1
" we thought we had it knocked down			1
" " it got up into the trees			2
" " suddenly , fire was everywhere			2
" fire falling and bouncing and pouring like lava down mountainsides			2
fire exploding into tree crowns and launching a thousand bright brands			2
fire taking your breath and replacing it with fire			2
or at least that 's what if feels like during a blow - up			2
of course , fire stories like those are told by the living			1
on sunday in @entity27 , 19 @entity25 hotshots battling the @entity26 lost their lives when things got bad too fast			1
their story is now being pieced together out of the ashes by those who were not there with them			2
... but why were they there ? why were 19 men who were so full of life so drawn to this dangerous occupation ? remembering the firefighters i started on a @entity46 hotshot crew years ago and worked 12 fire seasons as a @entity49 smokejumper , parachuting to fight wildfires in the @entity51 and @entity52			1
it was hard work and high adventure -- the best job i 've ever had , the best people with whom i 've worked			1
like the @entity60 hotshots , we charged toward the fires , lugging heavy packs and swinging heavy tools , digging firelines and felling trees , separating the fuels from the fires			1
my first jump fire was a two - manner , high on @entity69 in @entity70			2
@entity71 and i fought a small lightning fire , until another huge bolt exploded a ponderosa pine tree right below us in a blast so bright that i saw its afterimage for an entire minute			2
we put out that fire and then were helicoptered out , to land in front of magnificent and ancient cliff dwellings			2
i was hooked , just like thousands of other wildland firefighters			1
there were always close calls			0
in @entity52 , with a fire pressing us , we built an island of rocks out in a small lake and stood on it to let the fire blow past us			0
on another fire call , our @entity90 crash - landed on the edge of the @entity93			0
we squeezed out through a wing window as the plane began to burn			0
in @entity97 's @entity96 , with the fire heating up below us , we sawed down a dead tree and used its trunk as a battering ram to bust up a granite reef and build a helicopter landing pad			0
of course , we should not have been up on that ridge top with the fire cooking below us			0
the phrase , " and there we were ... " whispers the cause of almost every firefighting fatality			1
firefighters sometimes go -- and sometimes they are sent -- where they should never have gone			1
@entity112 's famous book , " @entity117 , " about the 1949 @entity114 incident , which took 13 smoke jumpers ' lives , reads like a classic @entity119 tragedy , complete with lessons of hubris and fate			1
@entity123 often love that book			0
but firefighters will read it and shake their heads			1
all we can think is that they should n't have gone down there			0
@entity130 warned team before fire killed 19 firefighting deaths are never classical tragedies			1
however , those who perish fighting fires are indeed heroes			1
their last moments are pinnacles of high emotion and drama			0
hold your breath and imagine it			0
in 1994 , a fire crew was caught on @entity145 's @entity144 by a fire flashing up through brush that had already burned once			0
two made it out over the ridgetop			0
when rescuers arrived , they found a surreal scene			0
the bodies they found lower on the slope were burned beyond recognition			0
those they found higher had been caught in a blast that was extreme but brief			0
their bodies appeared as though they had been bronzed			0
they looked like @entity166 statues , cast in their last moments of heroic , doomed struggle			0
and there the @entity60 19 were , on their @entity27 fire last sunday where they should not have been			1
and yet they were so right to want to be there			0
they were more alive than most of us are , more vital , more committed and more sincere in their lives			1
they fought fire to protect others ' lives and property			1
they shouldered the burden and faced the dangers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

@entity194 : " and there they were ... " begins stories about firefighters like the @entity60 19
as a smokejumper facing dangerous fires , he gets what might have drawn them to job
he says the @entity27 firefighters were heroes in *wrong* place
@entity194 : they were more alive than most of us are ; more vital and committed in their lives
