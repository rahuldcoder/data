@entity0 never gave much thought to where his car , bed or toothpaste came from until an aluminum plant in his hometown of @entity7 , @entity8 , shut down about four years ago			2
the closure left 650 people without a job , including @entity0 's father - in - law , in a town of roughly 3,800 , triggering a familiar pattern			2
the unemployment rate in @entity16 more than doubled , businesses shuttered and @entity7 's quaint downtown became a ghost town			0
@entity0 had been vaguely aware that @entity21 manufacturing jobs were going away , but now he knew what that could mean for an entire community			1
he wondered how an average @entity21 like him could change the tide			2
raising awareness of what 's still made in the @entity21 seemed like a good start , he decided , and embarked on a mission to live entirely off @entity21 - made goods for 30 days			1
it did n't take long for him to discover that it 's impossible , especially while trying to maintain a typical middle - class existence that includes smartphones and clothing from ubiquitous big box stores			0
he made the challenge harder by hitting the road and traveling the country , interviewing entrepreneurs and small businesses to find out what it takes to do business in the @entity21			1
he documented his efforts in the film , " made in @entity21 : the 30 day journey , " which is being screened through independent viewings across the country			1
share your story : transforming hobby to job @entity0 spent nights sleeping on floors and rinsing off from a bucket of water because he could n't find @entity21 beds , shower or sinks			1
but the lessons learned are as relevant as ever , especially as the country looks for ways to boost employment and bring @entity21 manufacturing into the 21st century , he said			1
" despite what you might hear , a lot of entrepreneurs and small businesses are making it work , " he said			1
" our fate as a country is tied to our economic prosperity and given what i 've seen i believe there 's still room for us in the manufacturing era			2
" the challenge has now become a way of life whenever he can help it , he said			0
checking product labels for country of origin is now a part of his shopping routine , he said			0
he has also immersed himself in online communities that share information about where to find @entity21 brands , products and companies			1
" just because you ca n't live 100 % off @entity21 - made goods does n't mean you ca n't make a difference , " he said			1
" we 're in a global economy so it does n't have to be an all - or - nothing proposition			0
but if you change just a little bit of your lifestyle it can make a difference			2
" made in @entity21 : the short list the people he met shared his view that a little bit of effort can go a long way for small businesses trying to make it			1
it 's not just a matter of blind patriotism , but of supporting companies that model fair business and labor practices -- even if they do n't manufacture in the @entity21			2
" it 's not always possible to live off exclusively @entity21 made goods because some products simply are not manufactured here and other items are not native to our country , " said @entity121 , founder of made in usa challenge , which shares resources and information for buying @entity21 - made products			1
" for many electronics , there is no currently available made in @entity21 option			2
for these purchases , i suggest minimizing your footprint as a consumer by buying used , " she said			0
" other items like oils or certain foods may not naturally grow in our country			0
for those products , i recommend buying fair - trade certified			0
" plenty of things are still made in the @entity21 , even though the average @entity21 consumer does n't get their hands on them on a daily basis , @entity148 with @entity149 said			1
most @entity21 manufacturing jobs focus on heavy machinery , like aircraft , cars and supply chain parts , along with chemicals and energy products			1
still , rising costs of doing business overseas and relatively affordable energy are making reshoring more attractive to businesses , @entity148 said			0
manufacturing has made a " strong showing " in the last four years in terms of employment and output , with signs of continued growth , @entity148 said			0
in 2012 , manufacturers contributed $ 1.87 trillion to the economy , about 11.9 % of the gdp , up from $ 1.73 trillion in 2011 , according to @entity178			0
for every $ 1 spent in manufacturing , another $ 1.48 is added to the economy			0
as far as consumer goods are concerned , the average @entity21 should have no trouble finding food , beverages , paper products or toiletries from the @entity21 , which @entity0 learned early on			1
a trip to the grocery store nets a toothbrush , shaving cream and food , including protein bars and gummy worms			0
that was a source of relief for @entity0 , a " bacon and eggs kind of guy " who was worried about having to just eat fruits and vegetables for breakfast during his 30 - day experiment			0
the people he met on his journey underscored the fact that even products made in the @entity21 are made of materials sourced from other countries			1
a tailor in @entity210 , @entity8 , carries suiting made from @entity212 wool , @entity214 lining and @entity216 buttons stitched together with silk thread from @entity218 -- all sewn together by " immigrants in @entity220 , " @entity208 the tailor tells @entity0			2
@entity0 took his challenge to more than a dozen cities and towns on an estimated budget of $ 30,000 , partially raised through an @entity226 campaign , driving @entity21 rental cars and staying in @entity229 hotels whenever possible to stay true to his mission			2
eventually , he reclaims his smartphone from his friend and showers more frequently			0
but he hopes the point has been made			0
" advanced manufacturing will be the next revolution in this country , " @entity0 said			1
" it may not look the same as it did in late 30s and 40s , but it will return @entity21 to prosperity			0
