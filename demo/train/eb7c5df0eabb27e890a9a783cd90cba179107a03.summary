@entity0 -- for the first time , urban dwellers in @entity3 now outnumber those living in the country			1
at the end of 2011 , @entity3 counted 690.79 million urban dwellers , the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) said tuesday			1
that marks an increase of 21 million over the previous year and accounts for 51.27 % of the country 's 1.347 billion people			0
during the same period , the rural population shrunk by 14.56 million to 656.56 million			2
the number of people between the ages of 15 and 64 stood at about 1 billion , or 74.4 % of the total population , the @entity9 added			0
@entity3 's breakneck economic growth over the past three decades has seen an explosion in the size of @entity3 's cities and towns , especially along its prosperous east coast			1
@entity3 's economic growth slowing ? spurred by @entity28 's reform policies of the 1970s , which were aimed at modernizing an economy that had been dominated by agriculture , millions of @entity3 farmers have been on the move , a massive internal migration that has changed the face of @entity3			1
many of these migrant workers , known as " mingong , " have left the countryside for the cities looking for better - paid jobs in areas such as manufacturing			1
mega-cities like @entity43 , @entity0 and @entity44 , have been at the heart of this change , serving as the engines of @entity3 's rapid economic transformation			2
" urbanization is an irreversible process and in the next 20 years , @entity3 's urban population will reach 75 % of the total population , " said @entity49 , head of the @entity50 at @entity51 , in quotes carried by @entity53			1
" this will have a huge impact on @entity3 's environment , and on social and economic development			2
" there are at least 200 million migrant workers in the whole country , according to a national census carried out in april last year			0
many are seasonal workers who work in cities part - time and then return to their villages -- though an increasing number live and work in urban centers permanently			0
however , it is difficult for many rural migrants working in cities to become fully - fledged urban residents , due to a centuries - old household registration system known as " hukou , " which categorizes the population into rural and urban residents			0
without an urban hukou permit , a migrant is often denied access to the subsidized health , housing and education for children that city dwellers enjoy .			0
