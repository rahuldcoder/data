-- @entity1 was n't that mad			1
and with only 17 @entity4 followers , the 48 - year - old certainly was n't popular when he reportedly created the # @entity6 hashtag			1
but that online conversation would become one of the dominant storylines of the @entity10 , particularly among people who like to mock @entity13 's sportscasters and in the @entity14 where viewers were upset with the network for delaying its broadcasts of the games to show them in prime time			1
@entity1 , a web designer in @entity20 , @entity21 , is credited by the blog @entity23 with creating that conversation in reference to the @entity26			1
" interesting how @entity13 never mentions you need a cable / satellite subscription w / @entity30 / @entity29 to view any coverage online			1
# @entity36 , " @entity1 wrote on his @entity4 account on july 26 , the day before the @entity34 in @entity35			1
he was surprised by the heated and hilarious conversation that followed			2
" i do n't know to what extent i can take credit , " he told @entity0 by phone on tuesday			1

" it 's kind of fun for me			2

" welcome to the @entity52 @entity1 was on vacation in @entity54 when someone sent him a message on @entity4 telling him that bloggers were crediting him with starting the @entity59 topic			1
he found it amusing in part because he was n't all that mad at @entity13 , just annoyed that he could n't watch @entity63 programming live and online for free			1
it sounds as though he almost feels bad about playing a small role in unleashing the fury of the internet on the @entity14 broadcast network			0
" in some ways it 's showing some of the worst sides of what this instant media can do , " he said , adding : " it 's sort of that mob mentality that @entity4 encourages			0

but in the @entity82 ( @entity81 ) movement , it showed the good that @entity4 can do for organizing			0
even though it 's made me slightly famous , i 'm not necessarily thrilled with what 's happened			0
i 'm not terribly impressed with @entity13 , but that 's not new this year			0
" some online writers have said that watching the # @entity6 hashtag has become more fun than watching the actual @entity10			2
