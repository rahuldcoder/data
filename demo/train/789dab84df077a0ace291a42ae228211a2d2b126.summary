-- look out air travelers			2
a congressional slugfest over the @entity4 deficit is threatening to trigger higher airfares and widespread slowdowns at the nation 's airports			2
remember that big fight in @entity10 last year over the national budget deficit ? eventually @entity10 and the @entity12 agreed to scheduled budget cuts that are so deep that lawmakers would be forced to come together on tough choices			1
@entity17 wonks call these cuts " sequestration			2
" related story : sequestration is the ' dumbest thing ' the @entity23 is in the cross hairs for sequestration -- with a possible $ 1 billion in mandatory cuts scheduled to occur as soon as january			1
the @entity23 chief warned of the impact of such cuts			1
and a new study says the cuts would result in fewer air traffic controllers , customs officers and security officers			1
the @entity23 's sweeping overhaul of the @entity4 air traffic system also would take a hit			1
@entity38 , as it 's called , is aimed at improving efficiency and increasing safety			0
" if the sequester were to occur , we would face some very drastic cuts in services and these investments , " said @entity23 acting administrator @entity41 , in an october speech			1
" these cuts would impact air traffic control services , @entity38 implementation , and aircraft certification -- all of which are critical to our ability to move forward with aviation in this century			1
" they would result in significantly less efficient and less convenient air travel service for the @entity4 traveling public			1
we will always , however , maintain the highest levels of safety			0
" it 's anybody 's guess -- and up to @entity10 -- whether the cuts will actually happen			2
but groups representing pilots and the aerospace industry say it 's time to get nervous			0
opinion : clock ticking on defense cuts @entity70 , who headed the @entity23 during the @entity72 administration and who now leads an aerospace industry lobbying organization , warned in august that just the threat of the cuts is already having a chilling effect			1
consumers should be worried , she warns			0
" this will affect their ability to fly when they want and how they want , " @entity70 says			0
" it will certainly be a drag on the airlines , which then will incur great cost , which then will be passed on to the consumer or it will cut into the carriers ' very meager profits and that 's not healthy			0
" @entity70 's group , the @entity92 , and @entity93 released a study in august that paints a worst - case scenario , including possible closure of 246 airport control towers , 1,500 fewer air traffic controllers and the loss of 9,000 security screeners and 1,600 customs officers			1
obviously , fewer controllers , screeners and customs people would throw a wrench into an already stressed air travel system			1
" a billion dollars is a body blow to the @entity23 , " @entity70 says			1
for industry planners , @entity70 says january is right around the corner , and making industry decisions amid such uncertainty comes with an economic price that will affect the consumer			0
not only would airline passengers feel the cuts , but pilots of small aircraft , known as general aviation , or @entity119 , will see ramifications , both in safety and efficiency , says @entity123 , senior vice president of government affairs at the @entity125			2
the cuts could include the shut down of more than 200 control towers , " which operate almost exclusively at @entity119 locations , " she says			0
" it 's unclear to us how the @entity23 would go about literally closing the doors and turning out the lights , " she says			1
" but there 's definitely a safety risk that would have us concerned			0
" safety would not be an issue , @entity70 says			0
" i have every confidence they 'll keep it safe , " she says , although she expects @entity23 controllers will slow traffic at small airports by reducing hours of operation and capacity			1
" i do not anticipate that the @entity23 will reduce hours and personnel at the nation 's big air traffic control centers and the @entity152 radar tracking centers , " she says			1
for now , many in the aviation industry are taking a wait - and - see attitude			0
" there is a great deal of uncertainty about whether sequestration will actually happen and what the real impact would be on commercial aviation , " writes a spokeswoman for the airline industry trade group @entity157			0
other groups are n't talking at all			0
the @entity166 would n't comment in august , and the @entity23 referred questions to the @entity168			1
the @entity168 has 30 days to analyze the sequestration legislation and to make recommendations to the @entity12			0
an internal @entity168 memo ( @entity172 ) in july said sequestration would be " highly destructive to national security and domestic priorities , as well as to core government functions , " and that @entity174 has submitted deficit reduction proposals to @entity10 aimed at avoiding the cuts			2
the cuts would delay deployment of the multibillion - dollar @entity38 program by at least a decade , according to the study			2
" it 's a very big deal to keep that on track , " @entity70 says			0
" it 's going to get hit ; it 's just a question of how much			0
" this is not just about @entity23 , @entity70 says			2
think about the idea of cutting 9,000 @entity191 screeners			0
" how do you like the lines now ? how are you going to like them then ? " she says , " people would like to treat this as a hypothetical or a simple congressional debate			0
" but the threat will grow , she warns , unless " people step up and try again to address the long - term issues " surrounding the nation 's debt and deficit -- or they postpone the @entity23 cuts to give themselves more time for a compromise .			1

budget battle may result in slower air travel , higher fares
@entity23 cuts could lead to fewer controllers , security and customs officers , study says
@entity220 chief : fear of the cuts is already having a chilling effect
