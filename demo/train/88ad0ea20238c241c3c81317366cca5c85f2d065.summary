december holiday shoppers were not just interested in buying the hottest electronics and toys -- they also were purchasing record numbers of guns , according to the latest @entity6 figures on background checks required to buy firearms			1
with a few days left in december , the @entity6 reports the number of background checks has already topped the previous one - month record -- set only in november -- of 1,534,414 inquiries by gun dealers to the @entity13 also known as @entity13			1
almost half a million checks were done in just the last six days before @entity15			2
two days before @entity15 , @entity13 ran 102,222 background checks , which was the second - busiest day in history			1
the one - day record was set this year on @entity19 , the big shopping day following @entity20 , with 129,166 searches			2
by comparison , the previous one - day high was set november 28 , 2008 , when gun dealers made slightly less than 98,000 requests for background searches			1
it 's not possible to tell exactly how many guns have been purchased because buyers often take home more than one gun			0
but most people pass the background checks			1
only 1.3 % of the searches result in people being denied permission to buy a weapon , said @entity6 spokesman @entity38			0
@entity6 officials did not offer a theory on the spike in gun sales			0
it 's also not clear how many of the background checks were for people who never had owned guns before and how many were for gunowners adding to their collections			1
the @entity49 says the figures indicate more people feel they need guns for self defense			1
" i think there 's an increased realization that when something bad occurs , it 's going to be between them and the criminal , " @entity49 spokesman @entity54 told @entity55			2
@entity61 said @entity62 realize police can not be everywhere there 's trouble and also that some officers are being laid off due to budget cutting			0
the @entity49 spokesman also said an increased number of @entity62 are participating in skeet shooting and other gun sports			0
a leading gun - control organization says repeat buyers most likely are responsible for the holiday surge in guns sales			0
" the research we 've seen indicates fewer and fewer people are owning more and more guns , " said @entity76 of the @entity77			0
" all the trends indicate the number of @entity62 who own guns has declined			0
" " it would appear because of fear - mongering by the @entity49 since ( president @entity89 ) @entity89 's election that people are adding more guns to their arsenals out of fear @entity89 and the @entity94 will take away their guns , which is absurd , " said @entity85 .			2

the one - month record for background checks was set in november -- over *1.5* million
december has already surpassed that record -- with a few days left in the month
