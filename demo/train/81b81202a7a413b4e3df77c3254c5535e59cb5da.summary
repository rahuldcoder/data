-- it took until the presidential campaign was over , but @entity3 finally figured out the sinister plan @entity5 executed to win re-election			1
here 's how it worked : during his first term , @entity5 craftily carried out policies that helped improve @entity11 ' lives , thereby tricking them into voting to re-elect him			1
@entity13 ! ok , that was n't exactly how he put it			2
but in a conference call with his major donors after the campaign ended , @entity3 attributed his loss to the fact that @entity5 gave " gifts " to various groups to win their loyalty			1
young people , women , latinos , african - americans , all voted for @entity5 because he showered them with presents , he concluded			1
" with regards to the young people , for instance , a forgiveness of college loan interest was a big gift , " @entity3 said			1
" @entity35 contraceptives were very big with young , college - aged women			2
and then , finally , @entity37 also made a difference for them , because as you know , anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents ' plan , and that was a big gift to young people			0
" @entity3 's interpretation of the election results provides an apt footnote to his campaign , an encore performance of the infamous " 47 % " videotape			1
and that was hardly an isolated incident ; you 'll recall that @entity3 spent weeks attacking the @entity5 administration for supposedly eliminating the work requirements in welfare			1
" you would n't have to work , " said a @entity3 ad			1
" they just send you your welfare check			0
" the claim was false , but it sent the message he wanted : @entity5 was the candidate of the moocher class , the leeches who wanted only to luxuriate in their unearned benefits while good people worked for a living			1
but this idea did n't just occur to @entity3 out of nowhere			1
if in the last couple of years you 've been listening to conservative talk radio , watching @entity76 or even attending panel discussions at tony conservative think tanks in @entity79 , you 've heard this analysis again and again			0
as the title of a recent book by a scholar at the @entity86 has it , we 've become " a @entity87 , " selfishly grabbing what we can while hoping someone else will pay for it all			0
and since the election , one conservative after another has been complaining about those ungrateful @entity11 with their hands out			0
" there are 50 % of the voting public who want stuff			0
they want things , " said @entity98 on @entity99			0
" and who is going to give them things ? president @entity5			2
" which brings us back to the word @entity3 used over and over on that phone call : " gift			2
" apparently , he believes that when the government works to ensure that everyone has access to health care , or that young people can afford to attend college , it 's kind of like giving a kid a new @entity118 -- he did n't need it , he probably did n't deserve it , but we gave it to him anyway so there wo n't be any tantrums for a while			1
you might say that a guy who does n't have an actual job , yet pulls in $ 20 million a year on which he pays 14 % in federal income taxes because of how the tax system is so skewed in his favor perhaps should not be talking so contemptuously about the government giving people gifts			1
but in the world that @entity3 and his wealthy donors inhabit , policies that benefit the upper class ca n't possibly be " gifts			1
" is eliminating the estate tax a gift ? @entity141 , no. it 's just a way to encourage investment , which is good for all of us			0
only benefits that accrue to the common folk are gifts , those undeserving masses gauche enough to send their children to public schools ( another gift ) , who worry about finding insurance if they have a pre-existing condition , who think that clean air and water are things everyone deserves			1
the truth is that we are all both takers and givers , at different times and in different ways			0
we pay taxes and we get benefits from government , both collective ( such as national defense and clean air ) and individual ( such as @entity169 )			0
we take from our parents , then give to our children			0
we 're individuals who make our own way , but we also live in a society where we depend on one another every day			0
for all the pettiness and silly attacks we saw in this election , there was also a genuine and enlightening philosophical debate			0
republicans tried to paint the nation as an @entity183 fantasy world in which there are only two kinds of people : the brave individualists needing nothing from anyone , and the blood - sucking parasites who rely on government			0
the voters took a look at that fantasy and decided it was n't true			2
but @entity3 still believes it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : @entity3 now sees @entity5 won by *diabolically* helping voters with policies
he says @entity3 told donors these " gifts " aimed at *blacks* , *hispanics* , women , young
@entity201 : this idea not new from the right -- tax breaks not " gifts , " but public benefits are
@entity201 : election actually *revealed* this *disconnect* , and voters showed they did n't *buy* it
