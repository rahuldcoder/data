for @entity1 , there 's no escaping the misery			1
because of @entity7 , @entity4 's home in @entity5 , @entity6 , is ruined by floodwaters			1
so , too , is the gas station and convenience store he owned and ran in the community , 15 miles by car and 10 miles as the crow flies from @entity15			1
but all that pales to what @entity4 , the fire chief for @entity5 and @entity17 in @entity18 , saw when he and fellow volunteer firefighters steered their boat up to the home of a couple he knew			1
inside , they found the pair floating in the kitchen , the first of at least three fatalities in @entity6 being blamed on @entity7			1
" it 's not something i want to see , and i hope it 's the last ones we do see , " said an exhausted @entity4 on friday , a day after he pulled the couple from the home			1
in terms of total deaths , @entity7 does n't compare to @entity37 , which led to nearly 1,800 fatalities in @entity15 and the vicinity seven years ago			1
@entity7 struck @entity6 on tuesday night as a category 1 hurricane , not a category 3 like @entity37			1
do n't tell that , though , to the thousands of residents in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity18 and other parishes who friday found their homes and hometowns still deluged			1
even with a few drops of drizzle falling all day and with levels down considerably from the previous day , waters were still 10 feet deep in spots			2
deja vu , man , " @entity56 , president of @entity18 said thursday as he surveyed the town of @entity58 , inundated by floodwater and sludge			2
" there is more water here than @entity37			0
" it was a sentiment echoed by an assistant fire chief in the parish , while on a boat moving through an area in which floodwaters almost universally covered the first floor of 200 homes			1
red carpet still out for @entity15 tourists most people had heeded a mandatory evacuation order issue monday , but not all			1
video footage from @entity79 affiliate @entity15 @entity78 showed rescuers pulling out an ax and hacking an attic vent			1
soon after , 70 - year - old @entity83 climbed out and slid down his roof			0
rescuers also managed to get out his four dogs , one of whom fell into the water and another who jumped into a reporter 's arms			2
dressed in a t - shirt and shorts , @entity83 said that he had evacuated ahead of @entity37			0
he told @entity78 that he 'd stayed this time because " i did n't think it would happen again			0
" but within just five minutes , @entity83 said his home was " six feet deep " with water			2
he then grabbed whatever he could , got the dogs , and rushed to the attic			0
there will be no rebuilding here this time , as @entity83 did after @entity37			0
" it 's just one of those things , " he said , still drenched , of the storm			2
" i 'm going to find someplace else			0
i 'm getting too old for this			0
" about 35 miles northeast in @entity111 , along the shores of @entity109 , @entity110 said that he came across at least 10 vehicles flooded and " unsalvageable " while surveying the city friday			0
@entity114 had also gotten into several homes , especially those without crawl spaces or , like @entity110 's , not built up on stilts			2
ironically , some of the luckiest residents were those who 'd had their homes destroyed by or after @entity37 -- because their rebuilt homes were elevated or otherwise protected , per new requirements to qualify for insurance			0
businesses along one strip in @entity111 , a community of about 27,000 people , were soaked in an inch or more of water , even though they are about five miles from the lakefront			2
" there are so many ups and downs , " @entity110 said of the floodwaters			0
" it seeps in all these weird ways			0
" at the same time , @entity110 said that many people he 'd talked to were both philosophical and confused about what @entity138 had wrought this time -- " happy " that they were n't hit harder but still " shocked that this , basically , tropical storm could have made such a strong surge			1
" inside @entity15 , anyone who lived through @entity37 knew it could have been worse			1
that did n't change the fact friday was not a fun day -- " hot , muggy , sticky , nasty , " especially for the many without electricity , according to @entity149 , another ireporter			0
some kept their refrigerators and such running with generators , which in @entity149 's case required five 5 - gallon gas containers to operate every 24 hours			2
a shortage of gas made keeping generators humming and cars moving difficult , and lines were long at the grocery and other stores that did open for business			0
yet they were bright spots under the still gloomy skies , @entity149 said			0
such the electrician from down the street who came over to fix her generator , she recalled			0
or those who cleared limbs and branches from their neighbors ' sidewalks , piling them up with no questions asked			0
@entity15 , and all of southeastern @entity6 , has been here before -- not just being socked by a hurricane , but rallying around each other afterward			1
and they 're doing it again , said @entity149			0
" it 's just people helping people , " she said			1
" it 's amazing to me , it 's nice to me			2
it 's a beautiful kind of thing			1

@entity7 hit @entity6 as a hurricane and lingered , causing *massive* flooding
waters remain high in parts of the state , with tens of thousands without power
a fire chief loses his home to flooding and pulls a dead couple out of their home
@entity15 resident says it 's " beautiful " how people are helping each other
