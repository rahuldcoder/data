-- it 's looking like the digital divide may have less gray hair than it used to -- but it 's still a big issue for @entity5 seniors			1
according to new research from the @entity7 , for the first time more than half ( 53 % ) of @entity5 age 65 or older now use the @entity11 or e-mail			1
also , most @entity11 - using seniors have made a daily habit of going online ; @entity7 noted that 70 % of them access the internet on a typical day			1
e-mail is especially popular with @entity11 - using seniors			1
nearly half of them use e-mail on a typical day			1
but social networking sites , which are accessed via the @entity23 or apps , are far less popular : just 34 % of seniors use these at all , and only 18 % on a typical day			1
looked at differently , those numbers mean that nearly two - thirds of seniors still either do n't go online at all or do n't do so on most days			1
seniors also are especially lagging in their adoption of @entity11 - enabled mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets			1
while cell phone ownership overall has risen sharply among seniors ( 69 % now have a cell phone , up from 57 % a year ago ) , @entity7 notes that just 10 % of @entity5 seniors own a smartphone			1
also , only 11 % own an e-reader , and 8 % own a tablet			0
only 39 % of seniors have broadband at home			1
this means a substantial number of seniors access the internet only from shared or public computers ( such as at libraries , internet cafes or senior centers ) , or by bringing a laptop to a location with open @entity53			1
just under one - third of @entity5 seniors own a laptop computer , @entity7 found			1
meanwhile , the @entity11 has become a key tool for accessing news , information and services that affect or can benefit seniors ' lives daily			1
and mobile access to online information and services could be particularly helpful to seniors			1
for example , transit is a crucial concern for many seniors -- especially those on a limited income , or who have visual or mobility impairments			1
obtaining and interpreting current printed schedules and route maps for buses and trains can be a challenge even for young , able - bodied people with good vision			1
but when seniors have to get to a location that 's off their regular transit routes , they can face enormous challenges in simply figuring out whether they can get to that destination via transit			2
i live in @entity87 , @entity88 , which has pretty good transit access compared to many cities and towns			0
earlier this year i overheard one of my neighbors ( a senior who does n't drive ) complaining that she might have to change doctors because her physician of 20 years moved to a new office in a part of town she rarely visits			2
what caught my attention was when she said , " i do n't even know what buses go there -- and have you tried to read that @entity107 map ? what a mess ! " i pulled out my @entity110 phone , brought up @entity112 maps , and asked her where the doctor 's new office was			2
she gave me the address			0
in less than a minute i found two potential bus routes to that location -- both involving transfers			0
i wrote down the route and stop information for her , and later she called @entity107 to have the relevant schedules mailed to her			0
when the printed schedules arrived , she mentioned it was a struggle for her to read the tiny , complex tables well enough to determine when the transfers might be easiest , so she could figure the best times of day to schedule her appointments			2
looking at those schedules , i found i had the same problem			0
but again , with poking around a bit on @entity136 on my phone , i was quickly able to give her some good options for appointment times			0
she said , " you can do all that on your phone ? so if you want to visit a friend or see a show you can find out which bus to take , just like that ? i had no idea ! " from there stemmed a conversation in which she revealed how over the years she 'd limited her outings mainly to places along the transit routes she already knew well , or where a friend could give her a ride			0
having a smartphone or tablet could help her find more transit options , but she 's not going to get one			0
she might be able to afford one , but she does n't think she could learn how to use it			2
" it 's just too different , " she said			0
seniors ' low adoption rates for e-readers and tablets also curtail their access to news , books and services			1
these devices are ideal for people with visual impairments ; any e-book or website can be viewed with large print			0
also , they 're light , easy to carry , generally easier to learn than a smartphone or computer and do n't require much typing -- considerable benefits to people with arthritic hands or joints			2
for instance , my parents are seniors who live in the greater @entity192 area			2
both lifelong news junkies , they subscribe to several print newspapers			0
avidly following national and local news is a key part of how they remain engaged and active			0
but for several years the company that publishes the @entity199 and @entity200 has been in dire financial straits -- including being sold this year for what @entity202 called a " fire - sale price			2
" it 's possible these venerable papers might cut back to publishing in print just a few days a week ( as the @entity208 recently decided to do ) , or go online only ( as the @entity209 has done ) , or fold entirely ( as @entity211 's @entity210 did in 2009 )			0
my parents are very concerned that they might lose their @entity192 newspapers , which they consider a lifeline			0
i 've been trying to get them interested in tablets -- but so far to no avail			0
if print papers disappear , they and many seniors like them will be bereft and disadvantaged			2
broadcast news is fine , but it does n't match the depth and range of what they 've been getting from newspapers			2
last year dr. @entity224 , director of the center for the @entity226 at the @entity227 , told @entity228 that " lack of access is no longer the primary reason that older adults are n't online			0
today , lack of participation is likely more related to other reasons , like fear of learning , how difficult computers are to use ( still ! ) , and just general lack of interest			0
" yet mobile devices seem to be marketed primarily toward people who are younger or , at most , middle aged			0
@entity7 's research is encouraging , but there 's still a long way to go in helping seniors bridge the digital divide			1
until this happens , seniors will grow increasingly disadvantaged in an increasingly digital -- and mobile -- society			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity253 .			0

@entity7 : more than half of @entity5 seniors now use the internet
still , two - thirds of seniors either do n't use @entity23 or do n't use it every day
a divide is increasingly significant as more services go digital
