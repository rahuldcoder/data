-- he did n't look like much when i first saw him strolling up to me at a campsite in @entity4 , @entity5 , exactly two years ago			0
his hair was stringy and unkempt , his thin face unshaven			0
a smudged shirt and dirt - covered pants hung from his wiry , 50 - year - old frame			0
i was leaving the communal bathroom , having just plugged my drained cell phone into the outlet by the sink , when i saw him			2
he nodded warmly as we passed and i found myself suddenly wondering if i had just seen the last of my phone ... when he saw me again , he said with incredible glee , " is n't this the most beautiful morning ? " i nodded and then went back into the bathroom to find my cell phone right where i left it			2
needless to say , i felt more than a little guilty about being so judgmental			0
and that 's how i met @entity27 , the man who would eventually become the heart of my fatherhood documentary , " the evolution of @entity31			1
" a short time later , i was washing some silverware at the campground sink when @entity27 appeared with his own dishes			1
as we scrubbed , he told me how his sons had brought him camping trip and how lucky he felt to be with them			0
" you know , fatherhood saved my life			2
i would n't be alive now if i had n't become a dad , " he confessed , explaining that before his three sons and one daughter were born , his life had been all about " sex , drugs and rock - ' n - roll			2
" as we finished the dishes , @entity27 talked about his kids			1
he said one of his sons was gay and how , despite his cultural background , he accepted his son unconditionally			0
he told me about his 4 - year - old granddaughter , for whom he was now a surrogate dad			2
i was startled and a little chastened			0
here was this guy , who , minutes earlier , i had worried would steal my phone , and who i now realized completely personified everything that was noble about fatherhood			1
he lived in the @entity63 with his family , did n't have a computer and sometimes he did n't even have phone service			2
there was a great divide between this man from an inner city latino community and me , a white @entity72 guy from the affluent suburbs			0
but the differences in our backgrounds dissolved as we quickly forged a friendship			0
i visited @entity27 and his family several times that summer , filming as much as i could of this dad who spoke for so many fathers			1
witnessing @entity27 with his granddaughter , @entity81 , as he lovingly took her to the park or for a stroll to the corner deli , was inspiring			1
@entity81 's biological father was n't in the picture and @entity27 had dutifully stepped into the role			1
and then there were the kids in the neighborhood who all looked up to him , many lacking dads of their own			2
@entity27 called his two - bedroom apartment " the safe house " because , in this particularly tough area of the @entity63 , it was a place that friends and family and neighborhood kids could come and always feel secure			1
for @entity27 , the world was a horn of plenty			1
" you see ? " he would often say to his wife , " if you have faith , @entity104 will provide			0
" his wife @entity107 , always the anchor to his exuberance , would roll her eyes with a " yeah , yeah , yeah , " and although they occasionally squabbled , the love they shared with each other and everyone else in this safe haven was always tangible			1
if wealth could be only measured in love , then @entity116 would 've had nothing on @entity27			1
sadly , there was a sense of urgency to film @entity27 as quickly as possible because his health was rapidly deteriorating -- @entity27 had full - blown @entity124			1
miraculously , he had managed to survive for more than 10 years with the virus because he had volunteered himself as a test subject for any of the experimental drugs that @entity128 was trying			0
he was even among the first to take " the cocktail			0
" as we sat together in his driveway one day , he told me that the doctors had recently told him that his medicine was becoming increasingly less effective and there was nothing more to do			0
still , we continued to spend time together and @entity27 remained upbeat and hopeful			1
one of my best memories of @entity27 occurred while taking a break from shooting , sitting with him in his driveway			1
in the heat radiating from the pavement , we ate plantains that @entity107 had graciously cooked for us and talked about what was going on in the world , about our families , about anything			0
it was like we had known each other our whole lives			0
as the summer slid away , so did @entity27 's health			1
his family became less interested in being filmed , and @entity27 explained that they were having a hard time coping with the fact that he would n't be around much longer			1
@entity27 passed away one snowy day in december 2008			1
even though his passing was n't a shock , it took a while for me to get over it			0
i 'd never had a film subject die before , let alone a friend			0
@entity27 agreed to be in the film because he wanted to be remembered and because of how important he understood fatherhood to be in the lives of our kids			1
i wish he could 've seen the finished film			0
but even though he did n't , i think he felt lucky to know that a part of him would live on in this way			2
for me , i just felt incredibly blessed to have met such an astonishingly wonderful man and a remarkable dad .			2
