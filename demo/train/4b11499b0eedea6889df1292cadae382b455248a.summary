@entity1 , @entity0 -- during the summer of 2009 , @entity0 from all walks of life waited in hopeful anticipation for the arrival of newly - elected @entity8 president @entity7 in @entity1			1
the city spent weeks preparing for the visit			0
streets were shut down , buildings lining the route to @entity14 were repainted , and the dome under which @entity7 was set to give his speech renovated			0
@entity0 listened to the president 's speech with much hope -- and when it was over , local talk shows spent days analyzing his words			1
@entity8 politics had gone on tour to @entity0 , a place that has historically watched @entity8 politics very closely			1
but @entity7 's visit in 2009 is yet another reminder of how drastically different the situation in @entity0 has become since the january 25th revolution last year			1
it is hard to tell there was a revolution in many parts of @entity1 just months ago			2
the rubble is cleared from downtown streets after each new battle between police and protesters , the blood washed away quickly			0
deposed president @entity44 's @entity43 building is still standing , but it has been burnt from the inside out			0
@entity47 - style partitions erected by the army block several of the six or so roads leading to @entity50 , the heart of the revolution			0
as the 2012 @entity8 presidential race heats up and the primaries get under way , many @entity0 are too busy with their own concerns to follow along			2
it has been more than a year since the uprising started , and while @entity1 has cleaned itself up , the city remains mired in turmoil and confusion over the transitional process to its own democracy			0
@entity1 , like many major cities in the world , has historically observed the @entity8 presidential election closely and with a great deal of skepticism			2
but the public mindset , typically littered with guesswork and conspiracy theories , is now one of indifference			0
in neighborhoods across @entity1 , men and women in smoke - filled cafes tune in to daily political talk shows discussing @entity0 's own crisis and fears for the future -- a new phenomenon in @entity82 days -- on televisions blaring so loud that entire neighborhoods can hear them			1
in the bars and cafes along the crowded , traffic - choked streets of downtown @entity1 , people are too busy making the news to watch it unfold on television			0
at the @entity100 , or inside the historic @entity101 , with its warm amber - tinted windows and walls lined with photos of @entity0 's great intellectuals , @entity1 's political activists and academics gather over beers to talk about the great issues of the day			1
we used to talk a lot more about @entity8 politics than we do now			1
friends of mine , avid followers of the @entity8 political scene who used to be able to name various congressmen and their policies , just are n't paying as much attention this time around			2
i believe the @entity8 election is incredibly important -- @entity8 foreign policy affects much of the world , and the president is the chief diplomat			2
but @entity119 have yet to choose a candidate -- they 've not found that ace , that someone fresh who can challenge @entity7 , and that 's making it hard for people to pay attention right now			2
@entity0 watched the 2004 @entity8 elections closely because they felt they had a stake in the outcome , especially considering the ongoing wars in @entity131 and @entity132			2
in 2008 , @entity1 closely watched as @entity8 neared the election of the first @entity135 - @entity8 president , the candidate of hope and change			1
@entity0 are viewing the 2012 elections with a certain amount of cynicism			0
all of the superficial reasons why @entity0 admired @entity7 have melted away , and what is left in some corners is a feeling that he was n't as quick to embrace our push for freedom as he could have been			1
while many @entity0 feel @entity149 had a clear position on democracy and freedom of speech in @entity0 , @entity7 came to @entity1 in 2009 and made promises to the @entity0 people that were not necessarily kept			1
and recent events have convinced some that the @entity7 administration is not so keen on fulfilling its promises to supporting freedom , democracy , and civil liberties			0
even though @entity149 is generally regarded negatively for his " @entity163 , " it is interesting to hear some engaged political activists say that they miss the @entity149 days , preferring his support of freedom of speech in @entity0 when compared to the @entity7 administration			1
one long - time activist said that during the days of @entity149 , then - secretary of state @entity168 made several visits to @entity0 , underlining the importance of democracy and freedom of speech			1
in 2005 , he said , the fruits of that pressure resulted in " relatively fair " parliamentary elections , particularly when compared to the second round of parliamentary polls and the 2010 elections			0
for the first time in recent history , our own political news is the dominant issue , so local media coverage of the race to the @entity186 so far has been dismal at best			0
and as our revolution continues , so clashes between protesters and security forces and the onset of uprisings in neighboring countries have saturated the news cycle			0
as the newly elected parliament here delves into its first session , @entity0 for the first time are experiencing their own taste of democracy , with all the troubles that comes along with it			1
@entity0 are watching the newly elected members of parliament closely , watching as they become household names , waiting to review their performances			1
in the past , many @entity0 sought out hope and salvation in the actions of foreign governments -- but this electoral season , after a year of real change in @entity0 , many @entity0 learned that hope will have to come , or at least start , from within .			0

@entity0 revolution has *diminished* normally avid following of @entity8 politics
superficial reasons why @entity1 citizens admired @entity7 have faded
some @entity0 activists say they miss the days of former president @entity149
@entity0 's newly elected parliament only recently began its first session
