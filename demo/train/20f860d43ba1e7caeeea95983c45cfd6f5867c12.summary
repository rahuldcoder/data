@entity0 -- using firsthand accounts of coping with the threat of radioactive contamination , several @entity3 citizens who lived near the @entity5 nuclear power plant hope to convince @entity10 officials that nuclear energy poses an unacceptable risk			1
three operating reactors at the @entity5 facility suffered meltdowns in march from a combination of earthquake , tsunami and equipment failure that led to radiation leakage and widespread contamination			2
" i come from @entity5 , " said @entity22 , a farmer , who traveled with two of her children to @entity0			0
" radiation affects this absolutely unchanged scenery , but it 's still very much there			2
" her @entity28 was n't perfect , but her fears came through clearly at a news conference tuesday as she suggested that the @entity3 government arbitrarily raised contamination standards to limit the payment of relocation money			2
@entity22 's farm is in an area that no longer qualifies for assistance under relaxed measurements			2
she asked rhetorically , " did they think the ability of people to sustain radiation became better after the accident ? " two of her children , both teenagers , told of being frightened that they were exposed to radiation that could cause health problems in years to come			0
@entity48 , an organic farmer whose bees produce honey as an agricultural commodity , said she and her husband may have to abandon farming because they do n't know how radiation will affect their bees			0
she told reporters , " we have been farming for the happiness and health of the people , farming the way we did			0
now we are really struggling			0
it is very difficult for us			0
" the two women are part of a group that includes activists who oppose @entity3 's reliance on nuclear energy and want to use the @entity5 disaster to curtail the use of atomic power			1
they met with @entity10 congressional staff members monday , and on tuesday afternoon , they met with commissioners and staff members of the @entity76			1
@entity3 is already at minimum reliance on atomic energy because of routine maintenance and scheduled shutdowns			2
activists want to keep the plants closed			0
" there are 11 still operating and 43 shut temporarily , " said @entity83 of @entity3 's @entity84			1
" they 're gradually being turned off " for maintenance , she explained , " so unless they start up again , none will be operating by march 2012			0
" she acknowledged that @entity3 's government has every intention of restarting the nuclear plants			1
but @entity83 and the @entity3 families potentially exposed to the fallout from @entity5 say they 're encouraged by the @entity97 government 's decision after @entity3 's accident to discontinue atomic power plants over the next decade			1
the @entity10 and other @entity101 countries continue to envision a role for nuclear energy with a review of safeguards			0
@entity3 's activists believe there is no safe path that includes nuclear energy			1
@entity110 , who is fighting the restart of @entity3 's atomic power plants once they close for maintenance , told reporters , " there is immense suffering in @entity5 , including mrs. @entity22 and other families			1
the only way their suffering gets meaning is that we learn from this lesson			0
" citing the well - known nuclear disasters of the past 30 years -- @entity127 's @entity126 , the @entity128 plant in @entity129 and now @entity3 's @entity5 meltdown -- she said , " can we afford not to learn ? i do n't think so			1
