-- teenage sensation @entity1 followed up her record - breaking round of 10 - under - par on day one of the @entity3 with a score of 69 , but it was n't enough to retain the overall lead			1
@entity8 @entity7 , whose round of nine - under on thursday was overshadowed by her 15 - year - old rival , again kept a bogey off her card as a 67 took her one shot clear on 15 - under			1
@entity15 @entity14 is hot on the heels of @entity7 , her round of six - under drawing her level with @entity22 on 14 - under as the trio gear up for a battle in @entity19 over the weekend			1
" i went out just wanting to get in the competition more , after two months without playing , so it was a fun round , " @entity7 told the tournament 's official website			1
" i made good putts , took advantage of the opportunities and the same thing i did today			2
so i feel pretty good			2
" it 's funny because the tournaments i play better are the ones that i 'm rusty or that i 'm not hitting the ball that well			2
i think i come in with low expectations and things kind of happen			0
" i believe in things that are meant to be and i feel it 's meant to be for me to play good this week			0
hopefully it stays like that for the weekend			0
'' it is the first time @entity7 has led a tournament at the half way stage but she said she was comfortable with the expectation that brings : " i 'm not the type of player who gets nervous			1
that 's when i play better , usually			0
'' it was perhaps inevitable @entity22 would n't be able to repeat her heroics from day one but a steady round of four - under means she is well placed to launch an attack to claim the fourth tournament victory of her fledgling career			1
" i think four - under is a pretty good score out there			2
i mean , it 's not an easy golf course			0
i 'm pretty sure it is a pretty good score for me , " she said			0
" i mean at some points , because my putting was so good yesterday when it did n't go in i was a little disappointed but i think i putted well out there and played well			0
