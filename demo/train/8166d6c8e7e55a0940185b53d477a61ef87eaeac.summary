@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 spent 30 years as a homebuilder in @entity1 , but it was n't until 2005 that he found his life 's work			1
after helping renovate the home of a young @entity9 who had been severely wounded in @entity10 , @entity3 realized there were thousands of other injured war veterans who needed a hand			1
so he decided to help them by doing what he knew best -- building homes -- and giving them away , mortgage - free			0
for his efforts , @entity3 was recognized in november as one of the year 's top 10 @entity21			1
the exposure has helped take his organization -- now known as @entity24 -- to the next level			1
" it 's just been incredible , " @entity3 said last month			1
" we 've been getting phone calls and e-mails and donations from all over the world			0
" since the airing of " @entity21 : an all - star tribute , " @entity33 has received more than $ 100,000 in contributions -- as well as three pieces of property that will be used for future homes			1
all told , being honored as a @entity21 has enabled @entity39 to more than double his impact			1
so far , his group has completed nine homes , and it has 13 more planned or under construction			2
the spotlight also led " @entity47 : home edition " to partner with @entity3 on a special project last month : building a home for one of the victims of the 2009 shooting spree at @entity55 , @entity1			1
" we had seen @entity3 on the @entity21 tribute , and we thought , ' that 's a perfect guy we 've got to team up with , ' " said @entity56 , executive producer of the @entity58 television show			1
the home was for @entity64 staff sgt. @entity63 and his fianc√©e , @entity65			2
@entity63 , 29 , had just returned from his second tour of duty in @entity10 when he was shot four times at @entity55 , including once in the head			1
although doctors had given him only a 5 % chance to live -- at one point , @entity65 started writing his eulogy -- @entity63 not only survived but learned to walk again			0
@entity3 said the couple 's story and spirit is typical of the families that his group tries to help			1
" all of a sudden , their life has been turned upside down			0
and in spite of their injuries , they 're moving forward , " @entity3 said			1
" this is what our program 's about			0
we give ( families ) a hand up , not a handout			2
... they just need a little help in life to get them started			0
" usually about 200 people are involved in building a home for @entity3 's group , but more than 4,000 volunteers chipped in to help " @entity47 " build @entity63 and @entity65 's home in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity0 is about 30 minutes away from @entity55			2
" we have tons of military folks coming out and helping us , " @entity3 said			2
" that 's one of the reasons this job has gone so well			0
" it also means the home was completed at warp speed			0
the 2,800 - square foot , three - bedroom , three - bath house was built in just 100 hours			0
@entity3 's projects normally take about six months			2
for @entity63 and @entity65 , the home means stability and a fresh start			0
" it 's really exciting to know that so much love and care went into this house , " @entity65 said			0
" i think every time we look around , we 'll always feel that			0
" in mid-december , at an event honoring @entity63 and @entity65 , @entity3 announced that @entity33 had established a @entity125 to help all of the families affected by the attack			1
the fund will assist with emergency financial needs and home renovations like wheelchair ramps and handicap - accessible bathrooms			0
" now we know that all these families are not going to be forgotten , " @entity3 said			1
" @entity134 's going to step up , and we 're going to be able to help them			2
" the " @entity47 " episode featuring @entity3 will air february 20 , but people can already donate to the fund on @entity39 's website			1
all in all , it was a breakthrough year for @entity3 and his work			2
and he 's excited about having the chance to help even more people in 2011			0
" you know , sometimes i feel selfish because i feel so good all the time about seeing these lives changed , " he said			0
" now , we 're going to be able to change a lot more			0
