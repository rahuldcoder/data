@entity11 with @entity10 intelligence , the network is actually a family			2
last year , the @entity13 called the @entity1 " the @entity14 of the @entity15			1
" friday , the @entity17 administration said it 's going to designate the group a terror organization which would make is possible to freeze any personal assets the network holds in @entity23 banks			1
based in @entity25 , a tribal area of @entity10 , they 've been an effective fighting force in the region for most of the past 30 years			0
their calling card is bold and complex suicide bombings , including high - profile attacks on @entity23 and foreign personnel and assassinations of high level people in @entity35 and northern @entity7 , the @entity28 reports			1
the @entity1 maintain legal businesses ( like car dealerships and construction companies ) and illegal business interests from @entity7 and @entity10 and areas in the @entity41 and beyond , the @entity28 found			1
it also runs import - export operations and has commercial and residential real estate holdings			1
read at length about the ' remarkably resilient ' @entity1 in september 2011 , former @entity23 ambassador @entity46 officially blamed the @entity1 for a nearly day - long attack on the @entity48 in @entity35			1
sen. @entity49 , a @entity50 from @entity51 , said friday that she supported the administration 's action friday			2
" this group is responsible for more than 1,300 killed and injured @entity23 troops , orchestrates the largest attacks inside @entity7 , assassinates @entity7 leaders and seeks control of @entity7 provinces , " @entity49 said , noting that that the discussion to do this has been ongoing for two years			1
" over the past two years i have heard from leaders in the intelligence community and military in @entity65 and in @entity35 that designation is the right thing to do , " she said			0
for a more detailed analysis , @entity69 's @entity68 lays out the @entity71 and its objectives			0

" @entity103 is a brutal criminal murderer , " gen. @entity100 outgoing commander of the @entity23 @entity102 in eastern @entity7 , told @entity91 's			1
another @entity23 military source , which @entity91 's did not name , described @entity80 as " very much into the global extremism of @entity3 ... he has got those ties ( to @entity3 ) so he tends to be more violent than his father ever was			1

an unnamed military intelligence source explained to @entity91 's in june 2009 that the @entity1 would send politely worded but menacing letters to local tribes			2
