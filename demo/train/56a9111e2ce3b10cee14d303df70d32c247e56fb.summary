@entity0 , @entity1 -- after months of jury selection and delays caused by the defendant 's alleged suicide attempt , the triple murder case against @entity8 , one of two accused in the killing of a @entity1 physician 's family , is set to begin monday			1
@entity8 , 47 , and his co-defendant , @entity8 , 30 , are charged with capital murder , kidnapping , sexual assault , burglary , and arson in an alleged crime spree that resulted in the deaths of a doctor 's wife and two daughters			1
the two paroled felons are accused of breaking into the doctor 's home in the early morning hours of july 23 , 2007 , and terrorizing the family for hours before setting fire to the house			2
" the case against @entity8 appears strong			2
the real battle should be in the penalty phase , " said @entity30 , who was part of the team that prosecuted @entity34 cousin @entity33 , and is now a @entity1 - based defense attorney			0
" i expect the prosecution will present their evidence methodically , they 'll work to protect their case from any appellate errors and ignore the media and the behind - the - scenes political battle over the death penalty			1
" lawyers involved in the case are barred from talking to the media by a court - imposed gag order , so trial strategy and details of the crime have been kept under tight wraps			0
however those details could be made public during opening statements , as lawyers on both sides have moved to make them			1
while openings are routine in most states and typically serve as a road map to the evidence , they are not the norm in @entity1 , @entity30 said			0
" opening statements are usually up to the discretion of the judge , " he said			1
@entity1 prosecutors usually start their cases with a witness who will set the scene			0
in this case that could be dr. @entity8 , the only survivor of the home invasion			2
@entity78 was beaten and bound during the attack			0
according to local newspaper accounts , he has been a vocal advocate for the death penalty in his quest for justice			1
his comments at one point drew protests from @entity8 ' attorney , @entity87 , who complained to the court that @entity78 was trying to influence potential jurors			0
for legal reasons , @entity90 will be tried separately			0
he and @entity8 could face lethal injection if they are convicted of capital murder in the deaths of @entity8 and her two daughters			2
@entity8 also is accused of raping and strangling @entity99 and prosecutors have charged @entity90 with sexually assaulting @entity78 's 11 - year - old daughter			1
momentum to repeal @entity1 's death penalty hit a snag last year when the state 's @entity106 governor , @entity105 , vetoed an abolition bill passed by the @entity110 's @entity109 and @entity111			1
twelve jurors and seven alternates have been selected to hear the case against @entity8 , which is expected to take up to three months .			0

@entity8 is one of two accused of killing a woman and her two daughters
the woman 's *husband* , who was beaten but survived , wants the death penalty
