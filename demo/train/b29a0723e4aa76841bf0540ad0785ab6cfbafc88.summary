in a 20 - page report titled " @entity6 : the @entity17 of @entity18 , " @entity10 laid out allegations that @entity2 and the new @entity6 government failed not only to document the deaths but also has not paid reparations to the victims and their families			1
the report said that " scores of @entity6 civilians who did not directly participate in hostilities were killed and many more injured as a result of @entity2 strikes , " adding that the 28 - member nation alliance has yet to address the incidents in the months since it ended the air campaign			1
in a statement monday , @entity2 defended its campaign , saying the alliance " carried out our operations with utmost care and precision			1
" " @entity2 has looked into each credible allegation of harm to civilians which has been brought to our attention and will continue to do so , " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity35 said			0
" this involves an assessment of all @entity2 records , from target selection to any other data gathered following the strike			0
this review process has confirmed that the specific targets struck by @entity2 were legitimate military targets , selected in a manner consistent with the @entity52 mandate			0
" a letter sent by @entity2 this month to @entity10 in response to the report said the alliance " deeply regrets any harm that may have been caused by those airstrikes			1
" " while @entity2 did everything possible to minimize the risk to civilians , in a complex military operation that risk can not be reduced to zero , " the @entity2 letter said , according to the report			2
the report also faulted the new @entity6 government for failing to conduct impartial and thorough investigations , and it recommended it " ensure that victims of violations of international human law , and their families , receive full reparations			2
" the @entity6 uprising began days after a popular revolution in @entity76 forced president @entity77 from office in february 2011			0
@entity8 forces responded brutally to the uprising in @entity6 , drawing worldwide condemnation for the killing of civilians			0

@entity117 and @entity124 , which both approved the @entity6 resolution , have vetoed a similar one aimed at protecting @entity128 civilians in an uprising aimed at ousting president @entity130 .			0
