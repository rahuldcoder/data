a divided @entity1 @entity0 voted tuesday to let the government borrow enough money to pay its bills for the next year , sending the measure to the @entity6 in an effort by @entity9 leaders to avoid another politically damaging legislative impasse over spending			1
in the 221 - 201 vote , less than three dozen of the majority @entity13 joined almost all of the chamber 's 200 @entity17 to pass the proposal increasing the debt ceiling that lacked any deficit - reduction provisions sought by the @entity9 's conservative wing			1
the vote followed a reversal in strategy by @entity9 house speaker @entity26 after he and other leaders pushed the night before to attach a provision repealing cuts to military pensions to the debt limit measure			2
president @entity32 and @entity17 rejected any negotiation on what they called the responsibility of @entity37 to maintain the full faith and credit of the @entity1 by ensuring sufficient borrowing authority to meet all obligations			0
@entity0 spokesman @entity42 called the @entity0 vote " a positive step in moving away from the political brinkmanship that 's a needless drag on our economy			0
" treasury secretary @entity48 said last week the debt ceiling must be raised by february 27 , or the nation would risk a technical default			1
a @entity6 vote could come as soon as tuesday night or on wednesday , hastened to beat a possible major winter storm expected to hit the region on wednesday night			0
@entity9 change in tactics until tuesday , @entity0 @entity13 insisted that any increase in the borrowing limit had to come attached to deficit - reduction provisions			1
at a closed - door meeting on monday , they discussed a plan to increase the debt ceiling until march 2015 -- past the upcoming congressional elections in november -- while also repealing cuts to military pensions that were part of the recently passed federal budget			2
less than 18 hours later , though , @entity26 told reporters the @entity9 proposal could n't pass because " we do n't have 218 votes , and when you do n't have 218 votes , you have nothing			0
" some conservatives oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance , while @entity17 have made it clear they would unanimously reject any measure that tacked other provisions onto an increase in the borrowing limit			1
without a purely @entity9 majority , @entity26 decided to split up the @entity9 plan by holding separate votes on repealing the military pension cuts and a clean debt ceiling increase			1
the @entity0 easily passed the military pension measure earlier on tuesday , sending it the @entity6 for further consideration			0
in the later vote on the debt ceiling , only 28 of the 227 @entity13 who voted wound up siding with 193 @entity17 to pass it , while 199 @entity13 and two @entity17 opposed it			1
@entity26 earlier told reporters he would vote for it , and his top deputy -- @entity0 majority leader @entity95 of @entity96 -- also supported the measure			0
some @entity13 not sure republicans facing pressure from conservatives ahead of the november vote were reluctant to back any kind of hike in the borrowing limit , a core issue for the political right because it represents rising federal debt			1
despite his support for the proposal , @entity26 put the blame for needing a " clean " debt - ceiling bill with no deficit reduction provisions on @entity32 , saying the rising federal debt was his fault			0
" it 's the president driving up the debt and the president wanted to do nothing about the debt that 's occurring , will not engage in our long - term spending problem , " @entity26 said			0
" and so , let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants			2
" at the same time , @entity26 declared himself disappointed about what he called a " lost opportunity " to address unsustainable federal spending			0
@entity6 strategy in the @entity6 , @entity9 leaders urged against a filibuster of a clean debt - ceiling bill by their colleagues			1
by refraining from a filibuster , which would require 60 votes to overcome , the @entity6 's 45 republicans can oppose the increase in the borrowing limit without getting accused of obstructing the 55 - member @entity17 caucus from passing it			0
however , @entity9 sen. @entity143 of @entity144 , a leader of the conservative tea party wing in @entity37 , said tuesday he would filibuster the measure to force a 60 - vote threshold			1
@entity6 leaders had wanted to vote on the debt ceiling plan no later than wednesday , before the arrival of the storm			2
it was unclear if @entity143 's threatened filibuster would prevent an immediate vote from taking place			0
if @entity37 does n't pass a debt ceiling measure wednesday , further action was unlikely until february 25 -- two days before the @entity160 chief 's deadline -- because of a shortened congressional work schedule in coming weeks due in part to the presidents day break			1
republicans across the ideological spectrum agree that another round of political brinksmanship could harm their party after it got blamed for october 's federal government shutdown			0
a recent @entity172 / @entity171 poll found that 54 % of respondents would blame congressional republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling , while 29 % would blame @entity32 and 12 % would blame both .			2

less than three dozen @entity13 join almost all of the @entity17 to back bill
