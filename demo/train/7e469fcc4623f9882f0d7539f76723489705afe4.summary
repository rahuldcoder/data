-- within minutes of the news of his death , the backlash started			2
in the comments section of his @entity0 obituary , on @entity8 feeds , in blog posts			2
@entity11 should n't be revered as a civil rights icon , the statements screamed : he should be exposed for what he is : a communist			1
to be sure , @entity11 ca n't be neatly grouped with @entity18 or @entity19 unlike them , he was n't always the pacifist he was known for in his later life			1
but should that be grounds for such bile - spewing vitriol ? we take a look at the three most common sentiments in these online accusations and put them in context			2
contention 1 : @entity11 was a communist what they 're saying : " before you go all wet and runny over @entity11 , remember he was a communist , and he never changed his views			1
" " so @entity11 was a communist who supported @entity40 and befriended @entity41 apparently ...			1
" what 's the basis : @entity11 was branded a communist by the white apartheid government , which made it a crime to be one			1
and it was a label the @entity49 was all too content to accept			0
the @entity50 between the @entity49 and the @entity52 @entity51 was in full swing			0
the @entity51 had constructed the @entity54 just months before , and the world was dividing up into opposing camps -- allies of the @entity49 or allies of the @entity51 and @entity59			0
this included many @entity62 nations			0
@entity62 's government came down on the side of the @entity65 -- and communist or not , @entity11 was squarely on the other side			1
what 's the truth : @entity11 's close association with @entity70 goes back at least to the 1940s , when he was enrolled in law school			1
he began a life - long friendship with @entity74 , " an ardent communist , " the anti-apartheid icon wrote in his autobiography " @entity77			2
" @entity11 described @entity74 as of the people , " without whom i would have accomplished very little			1
" a watershed moment tightly bonded @entity11 to @entity74 and other communist allies			1
police gunned down 69 unarmed protesters in the town of @entity85 in march 1960			0
then the government banned the communist party and the @entity88 , which fought for the freedom of black @entity62			2
with @entity74 and other @entity70 , he co-founded the militia movement @entity92			0
it 's meaning : " @entity92			2
" on december 16 , 1961 , the group carried out its first attacks on government installations and handed out leaflets announcing its existence			2
but was @entity11 a dyed - in - the - wool communist ? not really , believes @entity62 historian @entity100			1
" you must understand it all against the apartheid struggle			0
" @entity11 found the @entity88 too tame and had begun to push for a violent struggle in the 1940s , when he headed its youth league , the former professor of economics at @entity109 said			1
the communists were for the use of violence , and @entity113 believes it led to the alliance			0
after his release from prison , @entity11 made some high - profile appearances with communist leaders			1
he visited @entity119 in @entity120			0
and to commemorate the relaunch of @entity62 's communist party in 1990 , he gave a speech			1
but he also made a point of distancing his own party			0
" the @entity88 is not a @entity126 , " he said			0
contention 2 : @entity11 was a terrorist what they 're saying : " it 's amazing we forget he was a terrorist " " please explain how it is racist to point out that biographical articles about @entity11 are leaving out his terrorist actions pre- 1991			1
" what 's the basis : the @entity49 government placed @entity11 on a terror watch list , where he stayed until 2008 -- long after his term as president of @entity62 , and even longer after his receiving the @entity140			1
he was placed on it because of his group 's militant fight against apartheid			1
at the time that @entity92 carried out its first attacks , @entity11 was at its helm			1
the next year , in 1962 , he left for @entity148 and @entity149 , where he secretly studied guerrilla warfare			0
when @entity11 returned home later that year , he was arrested and charged with illegal exit of the country and incitement to strike			1
undeterred , @entity92 built a militia and in 1963 made plans to start a civil war			0
police intercepted the plan and arrested @entity11 and other @entity88 leaders			1
@entity11 received a sentence of life in prison			1
what 's the truth : it 's true that @entity11 once believed that civil disobedience was not enough to vanquish racism and apartheid			1
he felt he had to decide between the better of two evils -- submit or fight			0
he may not have been directly behind the attacks , said @entity172 , a historian from @entity62			0
" he was on the run , so i do n't think he had time for the planning on this			0
" @entity172 finds the 1963 plan amateurish , not exactly the design of a master terrorist			2
" i think it 's a very naÃ ¯ ve plan with very little outlook for success , " the former professor of political science at the @entity181 said			2
@entity11 changed his views on violence during his 27 years of incarceration			1
the rebel transformed into a pacifist			0
" as i walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom , i knew if i did n't leave my bitterness and hatred behind , i 'd still be in prison , " @entity11 said after he was freed			1
contention 3 : @entity11 was a racist what they 're saying : " how convenient that we choose to ignore that he once sang , ' kill white people ' " " if apartheid was racist toward blacks , @entity11 was equally racist towards whites " what 's the basis : @entity92 we sizwe beat the war drum against the " white supremacy " and " the white state			1
" its members often sang a song called " @entity212			0
" what 's the truth : though he despised white minority rule that kept the black majority down , he did n't dislike whites			2
" he was rather strong against racism , " @entity100 said			0
" the day before he was sent to @entity220 , he made a speech in parliament that he was against all forms of racism			0
" he was prepared to die for non-racialism , the historian said			0
@entity74 , one of @entity11 's best friends , was white -- as were many other revolutionaries who joined him in the militant group			1
" @entity92 is a new , independent body , formed by @entity230 , it includes in its ranks @entity62 of all races , " the group said in its manifesto			2
@entity11 has long espoused the way of reconciliation and called for there to be no racial violence in retribution for apartheid			2
in transitioning from the segregationist regime to a non-racial democracy , he partnered closely with his white predecessor , former president @entity243 , who shared the @entity140 with him			0
at a sports match in 1995 , as president , @entity11 made a gesture of support to white @entity62 that drew gasps			2
@entity249 was the dominant sport of white @entity62 of @entity252 heritage -- afrikaners -- and was reviled by blacks			0
during a world championship match against @entity256 , @entity11 walked onto the pitch wearing the jersey of his team 's captain			1
the scene inspired the 2009 @entity263 movie " @entity265 " directed by @entity264			0
the crowd began chanting his name			0
they were almost all white .			0

a backlash poured in against @entity11 's *positive* *eulogies*
*detractors* accused him of being a communist , terrorist , racist
there is some truth to some of the claims
@entity11 had a close association with @entity283 and *cofounded* a militant group
