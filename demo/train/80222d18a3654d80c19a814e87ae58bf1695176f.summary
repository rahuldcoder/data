-- you ca n't escape tango in @entity3			1
it is danced on the trains and in the streets			0
restaurants in the bohemian neighborhoods of @entity9 and @entity10 try to lure tourists inside with exhibition dancing outside their doors			0
taxi drivers play tango music on their radios , and giant billboards promote choreographed tango shows			1
@entity19 grew from the working class port neighborhoods of @entity3 to become a global dance and music phenomenon that in 2009 was inscribed on @entity25 's @entity24 list			1
but for those visiting the @entity31 capital for the first time , the sheer number of opportunities to experience tango can be overwhelming , and many of the best venues are off the beaten track			1
@entity37 @entity36 is here to help			0
here , the author of the " @entity39 to @entity3 " offers her insights for all aspiring " tangueros " traveling the city : history @entity19 was especially important in @entity3 at the turn of the century when immigrants -- especially men without partners -- were looking for a worthwhile diversion			1
the men would practice together to perfect their dance -- and hopefully impress the women			2
but tango moved from the brothels to higher society very soon after it became fashionable in @entity54			2
the music has always been an integral part of growing up in @entity3			1
generations have been nursed on it			0
the older generation of women dancers remember when they danced resting on the feet of their fathers			0
boys would sneak out to the dance halls to see the older men ( brothers and fathers ) dancing			2
while tango skipped a generation of men and women who preferred rock in the 60s , it is now very much in vogue among the youth			2
dance halls fill with young and old alike -- there are strictly no age restrictions			2
read related : musician 's passionate journey through @entity3 embrace the passion there 's a saying in @entity85 that captures the importance of the embrace in tango : " @entity92 " ( the embrace is more important than the step ) the prelude to tango begins at the moment that two people stand face to face and listen silently to a few notes of the music , before settling in on the embrace and beginning to dance			1
tango is a dance that stresses elegant walking and close attention to the music			1
more than anything , if you are new to it , just enjoy the scene			0
notice the subtle movements of the dancers , the ways in which they negotiate small spaces and crowded dance floors , and the delicate way they accomplish the seductive invitation to dance			2
where to watch there are classy dinner shows that feature full stage productions for tourists , and then there are intimate tango venues that provide more authentic shows for enthusiasts and local patrons			1
be aware that dinner shows can be expensive , and some of the more hidden and intimate clubs offer a less expensive alternative -- many charging only for what is consumed			2
on sunday afternoons at @entity129 in the @entity131 flea market , a local legend and resident , @entity134 , does a demonstration of tango accompanied by a bit of history ( in @entity85 )			1
even if you do n't understand the language , the demonstration is worth your time and , best of all , it 's free			0
a number of " milongas " ( dance halls dedicated to tango ) offer late night shows with either live music and / or authentic exhibition dancing			1
generally these milongas open at 11 pm , but @entity3 is a nocturnal city and the shows themselves do n't normally start until after one in the morning			1
two noteworthy examples are the milonga at @entity156 on thursday nights and that at @entity158 on tuesday and friday nights after 11 pm			0
at both places you will see locals , as well as tourists who are completely hooked on tango , dancing socially while making sure to respect all the dance floor etiquette ( " codigos " ) that make this a cultural experience			1
you will notice men signaling silently for a dance across a crowded room with the nod of their head , a wink , or a raised eyebrow			0
men and women are never seated together , even if they are in close proximity			0
the most traditional milongas place men on one side of the room and women on the other			1
if you 're more interested in choreographed shows , then head straight to the @entity19 , which offers a flamboyant dinner show , preceded by a lesson			1
the space has been restored beautifully with a real air of art - deco elegance			0
meanwhile , those concerned with the history and culture of tango should stroll to the former fruit and vegetable market area of @entity198 in the @entity200 neighborhood , which is very much connected to @entity201 -- the definitive tango icon			1
@entity201 wrote many tango classics and was famed for his extraordinary baritone voice			0
he lived his whole life in @entity198 and within a two block radius you will see signs of this famous tango figure on buildings , in stores , and even in the museum that was once his home			0
where to learn tango is a dance that takes years to master			1
however , a good teacher can get you on the dance floor , walking simply and in time to the music , within a few lessons			2
the two studios that teach tango seriously and cater in large part to tourists from around the world are the @entity228 and the @entity229 at @entity230 -- inside a beautiful upscale mall			0
both schools offer lessons to beginners as well as to experienced dancers			0
some milongas also provide lessons right before the official dance begins			2
one of my favorites is @entity241 at @entity242			0
the class is held on tuesdays and thursdays in the late afternoons			0
nothing builds the appetite more than a day of tango and , conveniently , there is a lovely @entity85 restaurant on the second floor where hungry bellies are quickly satisfied .			0
