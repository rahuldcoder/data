@entity0 -- @entity2 , one of @entity4 's biggest soccer stars , testified as his trial entered its second day tuesday that he was upset and angry when he thought he had been accused of racial abuse by another player			1
the normally staid chambers of @entity9 got an earful of shockingly foul language monday , as the court heard what the @entity14 captain allegedly said to @entity17 defender @entity16			0
early in the session tuesday , jurors heard an interview the @entity21 conducted with @entity2 after the october 23 match			0
@entity2 said he was upset because he thought @entity16 had accused him of racism			1
" i was really angry and cross about him calling me a racist , " he said in the interview			0
@entity2 made that point again as he was questioned before the court tuesday			0
" when he 's accused me of that , i could n't control my emotions , " @entity2 said			2
the prosecution suggested @entity2 could n't keep his temper because @entity16 had taunted him over his alleged affair with a teammate 's girlfriend			1
" you could n't , could you ? you 're not a racist but you used racist language			0
you snapped , did n't you ? " the prosecutor asked			0
but @entity2 rejected the argument , saying : " it 's two years on , i 've heard that a 100 times , a million times			0
if i was going to snap i would have snapped long before			0
" the @entity14 captain told the court he was repeating what he mistakenly thought @entity16 had accused him of saying as they traded insults in a heated game			1
in the interview with the @entity21 , @entity2 said he spoke with @entity16 after the match to ask him if the defender had accused him of making a racist comment			1
" i said to â € @entity53 € ¬ , ' was you accusing me of calling you a black c --- ? ' and he said ' no , not at all			0
' " in the interview @entity2 said : " if i had something to hide i would have whispered it into someone 's ear			0
" chief magistrate @entity60 earlier rejected a request by @entity2 's legal team to dismiss the case due to " insufficient evidence			1
" a lip reader watching a video of the incident on monday told the court what @entity2 said , including two extremely obscene words			0
@entity2 does not deny directing a barrage of foul language at @entity16 and referring to him as " black , " but he denies engaging in racist abuse			1
the highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as @entity79 soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport , with mixed results			1
@entity84 player @entity83 was banned for eight matches when the @entity21 , the @entity79 sport 's governing body , found he had racially abused @entity88 defender @entity87			2
the chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across @entity94			1
the @entity95 is pressing charges against @entity2 for a " racially aggravated public order offense " because of the comments during the match between @entity14 and @entity17			0
prosecutors played a video of the incident , without sound , as the case opened monday morning			0
the alleged abuse came after @entity16 knocked @entity2 down during the game , the jury heard			1
when he got up , @entity2 made a gesture as if @entity16 's breath smelled , and he called @entity16 a " c --- , " prosecutor @entity108 told the court			1
@entity16 responded with the same word , saying it described @entity2 , not him , because @entity2 had had sex with a teammate 's partner , the prosecutor said			1
@entity16 also made an obscene gesture related to sex as @entity2 ran back into position , @entity118 said			2
@entity16 testified that he did not hear the comments @entity2 made at him , but that he would have been " hurt and disappointed " if he had heard @entity2 call him a " black c --- " " when someone brings your color into it , it takes it to another level and it 's very hurtful , " @entity16 said			1
@entity2 maintains that @entity16 knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged " normal football verbals			2
" he told @entity21 officials that he then repeated to @entity16 words he thought the opposing player had said to him , @entity118 told the court monday			2
the maximum penalty for the offense is Â £ 2,500 ( about $ 3,900 )			2
that would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions , but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or @entity4 's @entity21			2
@entity2 was captain of @entity4 's national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in february			1
he remained captain of @entity14 , which went on to win the prestigious @entity153 this year			0
the trial could last up to five days , court officials say .			0

@entity16 says he did not hear @entity2 's alleged racist abuse , but would have been hurt
