-- tv personality @entity1 recently told in @entity2 she uses @entity3 possibly as often as she trims her nails			1
she also said her kids are useful gauges for when it 's time for a tune - up			2
she told the magazine : " when my kids start asking me if i 'm mad at them , and i say , ' why do you think i 'm mad at you ? ' they say it 's because i 'm frowning			2
i go , ' oh no ! i am ? i 'll be right back ! ' " pointing the needle in the other direction , recall actress @entity16 ' @entity15 comments a couple of years ago : " i want my kids to know when i 'm pissed , when i 'm happy and when i 'm confounded , " she told @entity17			2
" your face tells a story ... and it should n't be a story about your drive to the doctor 's office			0
" here we have two glamorous celebrity moms in their 40s with opposite feelings about @entity29 's most popular cosmetic surgery procedure , yet both seem to agree that altering the face alters the way we relate to our children			0
have we really talked about this , though ? i mean , really talked about it			0
just how does dulling facial expressions , appearing to freeze them in some cases -- yes we can tell , @entity40 -- affect that vital two - way communication street between mother and child ? could not being able to furrow your brow in disapproval when little @entity47 throws a fistful of mashed potatoes at your chest make you a less effective mom ? " ( @entity3 ) likely does limit and distort parent - infant communication , possibly making the parent look ' flat ' emotionally , " says dr. @entity52 , associate professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the @entity55			1
" facial expressions for parents and young children are really critical ways in which we communicate our intentions or whether we 're angry or sad , and that involves this very complex array of all the muscles that go into making facial expressions			1
so if you limit that range of expression , especially with very young children who are really attuned to reading facial expressions , then you limit the amount of information , the amount of emotion that you communicate using a facial expression			1
" celebs and civilians alike expected to ' bounce back ' after baby i was introduced to the notion that babies and infants scan mom 's face -- more so than the teenager whose head is buried in a smartphone -- while pregnant with my daughter			1
a friend had given me a copy of " @entity87 " by @entity88 and i was fascinated to read that female babies are especially sensitive to their mother 's moods and facial cues			1
in the months after giving birth , i really went for it in the grinning department , quite possibly setting my daughter up for a successful career as a clown			0
of course , let 's not forget that tots receive information from mom in other ways , like caressing , singing , voice tone and deep sighs when presented with a particularly mortifying loaded diaper			0
@entity52 , who also serves as director of the @entity110 hospital 's child development unit , says these other channels would make it difficult to separate out and measure a possible @entity3 effect			1
still , a @entity3 study came out last year that found the toxin lowers a key emotion : empathy			1
published in the journal of @entity119 , the paper was based in part on an experiment in which adults who had @entity3 were compared with adults with the dermal filler @entity125 , which unlike @entity3 does n't affect muscle function			1
at the root of the experiment , says psychologist and co-author of the study @entity133 , is the notion that we read a person 's emotions partly by mimicking their facial expressions			1
inject some good ' ol clostridium botulinum , and @entity133 says you likely " subtly impair your ability to mimic other people 's facial expressions			1
" moms gone wild : ' 40 - year - old reversion ' " mimicry actually serves important social functions , " he says			0
" when we mimic someone , they trust us more , like us more , and are more likely to be helpful			2
mother - child interaction follows these same rules because children learn to mimic and respond positively to mimicry from a very early age -- and it may be innate			2
" right -- most new parents squeal with delight the first time their baby copies them by poking their tongue out or blowing a little raspberry			0
" so , while no experiments have directly tested this yet , " says @entity133 , " it is plausible that botoxed mothers are subtly undermining their ability to connect emotionally with their children			0
" perhaps we can also learn something from so - called " still - face " or " blank face " experiments			0
in those , researchers study an infant 's reaction while their mothers face them and display no facial expressions whatsoever for a controlled length of time			1
while unsettling to watch , the studies are said to help teach us how infants ' social and emotional development might be linked to the emotional state of their caregivers			2
it also offers clues as to the effects of a mother 's post-partum depression on her child			0
@entity52 started conducting " still - face " experiments more than 30 years ago , and says he finds infants as young as 3 - 4 months typically respond to their despondent mothers by gesturing to her and trying to illicit a response from her			0
" and if it lasts a minute or two , sometimes the babies end up getting upset or crying because of the lack of response on the part of the mother , " he says			2
finding a mom friend in the big city but when it comes to @entity3 , @entity208 - based plastic surgeon @entity207 is n't convinced the procedure could lead to a mother - child disconnection			1
" i categorically , overwhelmingly disagree that that 's even a possibility , " he says			0
" you 'd have to put so much @entity3 in to reduce that much animation that the person would look like a stroke victim			1
even when i 've put @entity3 into the upper third of the face where it 's most commonly used , you still have complete animation in the lower two - thirds of your face			1
" @entity207 , who says quite a few of his patients are new moms anxious for @entity3 as soon as they stop breastfeeding , maintains that if you emerge from the doctor 's office without being able to move a single muscle on your face , you 've likely been treated by an irresponsible physician or one who has received poor training			1
" @entity3 should be done in a slight moderate dose so people can still animate , " he says			1
" you just reduce the appearance of the anger			0
we 're just blunting the expression ... really nobody should know that it was done			0
" furthermore , @entity207 says , what 's so bad about a kid not seeing his mother 's face scrunched in anger ? " if these moms ca n't make the angry face , or they ca n't project this angry image , maybe they are presenting a more positive image to their kids , " he says			0
" maybe they 're happier , maybe they 're going to be better parents			0
" possibly , but trying to project a positive image when your child is lowering the pet hamster into the garbage disposal is n't necessarily productive			0
stay - at - home mom @entity255 said her three sons -- twins age 12 and an 8 - year - old -- did n't notice anything different after she had @entity3 , aside from the bag of peas plastered to her forehead ( to prevent bruising , she says )			1
she was , however , surprised to discover her marriage benefited from the procedure			0
" what i found was this strange warm and fuzzy reaction my husband was having to me looking more relaxed , " said @entity255 , 39			2
" it was n't my intention but ... @entity3 makes me look like i have things under control , far more than i probably do			1
" i was trying to look my best so that my husband would always find me attractive			0
i did n't realize that those brow lines were more than just wrinkles			2
if one of @entity3 's side effects is making me look rested and more approachable , then sign me up forever			1
" you go , girl ! but when it comes to infants , @entity52 does n't think a brighter face because of @entity3 leads to giving off a more positive impression			1
" it 's just a momentary phenomenon , " he says			0
" very quickly you 're saying , ' what is this person really feeling ? what does this expression mean to me ? ' and i think to the infant , they 're not getting any information from the facial expression and they 're wondering , in a sense , ' is this a positive facial expression or a negative one ? ' there 's nothing to read because it 's not changing			2
" sort of like how repeating a word over and over renders it ineffective			0
like yesterday when i said " no " 827 times as i watched my daughter slowly carry my favorite sandal toward the trash can			0
where did the shoe end up ? in the trash can			0
i have n't tried @entity3 and ca n't say whether i ever will because i do n't own a crystal ball			1
but i 'd like to think my 2 - year - old has had all channels of maternal communication fully available to her since her birth			2
sure , it makes sense that some moms turn to the needle for some assistance and perhaps when kids are older it 's not a big deal			0
but when they 're teeny and vulnerable and might be hanging on our every head tilt and smile and squint , would it be wise to hold off on cosmetically enhancing our facial features ? the answer , perhaps , is on the little face looking back at us from the high chair			2
do you think facial @entity3 treatment could affect mother - child communication ? share your take in the comments section below .			1

babies pick up on and mimic the facial expressions of their caregivers
@entity3 *smooths* wrinkles and creases from the skin , which may limit facial expressions
dulling facial expressions could affect parent communication , a researcher says
a plastic surgeon disagrees , saying treatment that would cause such reaction is an outlier
