@entity0 , @entity1 -- at a morgue in @entity1 's largest city , five linen pouches -- each the size of a loaf of bread -- line the shelf of a walk - in freezer			1
wrapped inside each small sack is the corpse of an infant			2
the babies are victims of what one relief agency calls @entity1 's worst unfolding tragedy : the killing and dumping of newborns			1
" sometimes they hang them , and sometimes they kill by the knife , and sometimes we find bodies which have been burned , " said @entity21 , a manager at @entity22 , @entity1 's largest privately run social service and relief agency			1
records at @entity22 show that more than 1,200 newborns were killed and dumped in @entity1 last year , an increase of about 200 from the previous year			1
families view many of these children as illegitimate in a culture that condemns those born outside of marriage			0
statistics show that roughly nine out of 10 are baby girls , which families may consider too costly to keep in a country where women frequently are not allowed to work			1
the babies are usually just days old			0
their corpses are often dumped in @entity0 's sprawling garbage dumps , where they 're sometimes mutilated by street animals , @entity21 said			1
he estimates that hundreds of baby corpses are never found			0
the head of @entity22 , 83 - year - old @entity50 , blames @entity1 's crippling poverty and a government that , for decades , has failed to educate the masses , generate jobs and provide citizens with the most basic needs			1
" the distribution of resources by the government is wrong , " @entity50 said			0
" many people do n't pay taxes ; there 's no charity , and what you get from the government is all based on your wealth			0
" the @entity1 government has said it 's improving education , but 55 million @entity1 remain illiterate , according to the @entity68			1
and the government is billions of dollars in debt while entangled in a costly fight against the @entity71 and other @entity73 militant groups			0
the killing of newborns gets little attention in @entity1 , and rarely are they investigated by a police force that 's often poorly trained , lacks resources and stays focused on what 's perceived to be more important crimes			1
in many parts of the world , female infanticide is still practiced through direct violence but also by intentional neglect , according to the @entity86			2
in some @entity90 countries , infanticide of girls is enough to skew the population figures in favor of males			1
the @entity68 found , for example , that there are 130 boys to 100 girls in parts of @entity90 , especially in countries with extreme poverty and overpopulation such as @entity102 and @entity103			1
" girls are seen as a burden , seen as a property which belongs to somebody else so people see that as a waste of money and the wasting of an education of a girl , " said @entity109 , executive director of @entity110 , a nonprofit for children			2
" then when the girl gets married , the families have a big , heavy dowry			0
so that is one of the reasons here			0
" @entity109 said awareness and education at the grass - roots level are ways to combat this practice			0
" i think we really need to reach out to young people ( to ) create an awareness , to change attitudes and dispel the notion that having a boy is better than a girl , " she said			2
" we launched this program ' @entity135 ' -- that campaign is reaching out to masses using televisions , through newspapers and through ( the ) @entity140			0
what we are trying to do is positive messaging on the girls			2
that girls are n't a sect ; they are as good as boys			2
" in @entity1 , until things improve , the @entity22 said , it will keep more than 300 cradles in front of its offices throughout @entity1 where families can drop off unwanted newborns			1
the foundation cares for them and puts them up for adoption , no questions asked			0
" it 's for awareness -- that please do n't kill your innocent babies , " @entity21 said .			0

records from group show more than 1,200 newborns killed and dumped in @entity1 last year
many of those killed are girls because of cultural attitudes and poverty
in some countries , infanticide of girls is enough to skew population figures , @entity68 says
