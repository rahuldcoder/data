-- during her darkest hours in captivity , former @entity4 hostage @entity2 considered death preferable to her ordeal , she said in an interview with @entity0 's " @entity9			1
" @entity2 , who was kidnapped in 2002 during her campaign for the presidency and rescued in 2008 , wrote about her experience in a new book , " even silence has an end			1
" she recalled that late in her captivity at the hands of the @entity18 , or @entity18 , she became very ill. @entity18 declined to give her medication , and had her lie in a hammock for months , she said			1
@entity2 had seen other hostages die in similar circumstances in the jungle			1
" and because i was in so much in pain in my body and i was kind of unplugging mentally , in the sense that i could n't just concentrate on anything , i thought that perhaps it was a good moment to just , you know , " @entity2 said , referring to dying			1
in that moment , she said , she preferred death because it would reunite her with her father			1
" and , also , i thought that it could be a liberation thing for my children , because they had to stop their lives , " @entity2 said			1
that feeling was just one episode in her 6 1/2 years in captivity			1
writing the book , she said , brought her to " very deep memories , to places i thought i had forgotten and to situations that were very painful			2
" the writing process would leave her physically exhausted at the end of the day			2
@entity2 was freed in a high - profile helicopter rescue mission in july 2008			1
@entity4 commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group , which included three @entity50 military contractors and 11 @entity4 police and military members			2
her book is not the first to touch on her time as a hostage			2
in a memoir published last year , the @entity50 military contractors rescued along with @entity2 painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of @entity59 and @entity4 , describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp			1
for her part , @entity2 admits that she was not the most popular			1
" we hear the news and they talk about the hostages and the only name that comes up on and on and on is mine , " she said			2
" by not having their names , it was just another humiliation			2
it was just another torture for them , not knowing if people knew they were there , what was happening with their families			2
" the guerrillas who held them were also keen on keeping the hostages divided			2
this , she suspects , was so that they would not unite and attempt an escape together			0
much of the guerrillas ' treatment of their hostages was meant to be cruel and designed to strip away their identities , @entity2 said			1
" so , for me , it was important to preserve my dignity in the sense of preserving my soul , preserving the things that i thought were important for me to give			0
and that was a struggle , " she said			0
one way she did this was by showing defiance			0
when her captors ordered the hostages to identify themselves by numbers , she refused			0
although her fellow hostages started counting off , when it came to be her turn , she just answered , " @entity2			1
" " i did n't want to be a number			0
i did n't want to be an object , " she said			0
" they were referring to us like cargo			0
and i thought that was horrible			0
and i did n't want them to get away with that			0
so i think i was a little like a troublemaker , in some aspects			1
" that streak also partly led to divisions between her and the other hostages , she said			0
after such lows , how did @entity2 survive the long years ? " to put it in just one word , i think it was love , " she said			1
" the love of my children and the love of my mother			0
" reflecting on the current political situation in @entity4 , the former candidate said that the country is in better shape than when she was abducted			0
there remains , however , what she called a crucial problem : a disconnect between those who live in the cities very comfortably , and those in the countryside who are affected by the violence of the @entity18 and other rebel groups			0
" we have 4 million misplaced people in @entity4			0
and that 's because of the war , " she said .			0
