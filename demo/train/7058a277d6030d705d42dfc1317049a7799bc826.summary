-- @entity1 has endured the exhaustion of a decade of war and the insult of a battered economy			1
now many @entity1 reject all foreign entanglements as expensive , fruitless and , ultimately , futile			1
in a recent @entity8 poll , 80 % of those answering agreed with the statement , " we should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems and building up our strength and prosperity here at home			0
" for the first time since @entity8 began asking the question in 1964 , more than half said they believed " the @entity1 should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own			1
" in the past that figure has topped out around 40 %			0
yet even as @entity1 work to draw the blinds along the nation 's borders , the country celebrates the life of former @entity29 president @entity28 , a leader who looked relentlessly outward			1
" our human compassion binds us the one to the other , " @entity28 is quoted as saying , " not in pity or patronizingly , but as human beings who have learned how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future			1
" and right now that common suffering is found in abundance in @entity39			1
in 2Â½ years the conflict has gone from local uprising to sprawling and brutal civil war			1
the @entity1 announced wednesday it was suspending even nonlethal aid to fighters in northern @entity39 opposed to the @entity46 regime as moderates among them lose ground to forces aligned with @entity50			1
an estimated 125,000 @entity39 have died in the conflict -- the equivalent of killing the population of @entity54 , @entity55 , or @entity56 , @entity57			1
the war has made refugees of 2 million @entity39			1
more than a million of these refugees are children , and three - quarters of them are under the age of 12			0
polio has returned to attack @entity39 , most of whom have n't even reached their second birthday			1
cities are said to face starvation , with families said to be turning to eating dogs and anything else that might keep them alive			0
winter is nearing and humanitarian agencies are hurrying to ready supplies for the millions of refugees , many of whom fled with only the barest of belongings			0
as of september , 100,000 @entity39 children in @entity82 were not in school and the @entity84 predicts double that number in @entity87 before year 's ends			1
water and working toilets are scarce			0
news : @entity39 refugees face miserable winter in @entity87 the human suffering , in short , is great			1
but today we are fast - forwarding through these sad stories , keeping our eyes shut and our wallets closed			0
the charity @entity99 raised more funds for the victims of the typhoon in the @entity103 in three days than it has in almost three years for the war in @entity39			1
but few have taken to the streets or to @entity107 to say that the @entity1 should do more			2
in fact , the feeling seems to be that the @entity1 is doing quite enough			2
already the country is the largest humanitarian donor to @entity39			2
president @entity112 ran into resistance at even the prospect of armed intervention when he tried to push for " limited " military action earlier this year -- an effort that ended with a deal to collect @entity39 's chemical weapons			2
but he made no progress in creating a humanitarian corridor or imposing a ceasefire to help ease the suffering of those trapped amid falling rockets and flying bullets			0
juxtapose this against this past week , when the world has lauded a leader who showed through his actions and his words that human compassion and a shared humanity sat at the very center of the human experience			1
@entity28 pushed us to care about others , to see ourselves in others , especially when circumstances conspired to rob them of their homes , their livelihoods and their dignity			2
indeed , as @entity112 said at tuesday 's memorial service , " @entity28 understood the ties that bind the human spirit			2
there is a word in @entity29 -- @entity149 -- a word that captures @entity28 's greatest gift : his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye ; that there is a oneness to humanity ; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others , and caring for those around us			1
" certainly helping is complicated , but standing by as more children die and humanitarian catastrophe sweeps the country is a comfortless option			0
@entity1 is tired , but avoiding the world is not a strategy , it is a preference			2
it will not leave @entity1 safer or stronger			2
diplomatic energy dedicated to opening a humanitarian corridor is critical			0
former ambassador @entity170 is among many diplomats who have advanced the idea that @entity1 can do more			0
if the @entity1 can devote days of urgent and focused diplomacy to getting @entity39 's chemical weapons in safer hands , surely we can try harder -- in concert with key players and powers -- to do the same for @entity39 's children			1
and @entity1 , for their part , can give to organizations that help parents get blankets and water			0
and helping teenagers to deal with the traumas they have witnessed can ease some of their suffering			0
the world celebrates the life of a stoic hero who dared to stand up to injustice -- a man who would not live quietly beneath the easy shade of comfort , but who acted when he saw others suffer as oppression flourished			0
but we must heed his words as well -- a call to engage with the world , to ensure that those most vulnerable are not invisible , ignored			0
" what counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived , " @entity28 said			0
" it is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity217 : poll shows @entity1 are weary of foreign entanglements
she says we celebrate @entity28 , who spoke of shared humanity
many @entity39 children , *affected* by war , are facing a brutal winter
@entity215 : @entity28 urged making difference in lives of others
