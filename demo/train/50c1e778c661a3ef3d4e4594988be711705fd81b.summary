-- let the math begin ! with every team having played two matches , it 's time to start computing every possible variable in which teams like the @entity7 and @entity8 can make it to the next round			1
oh , if only the @entity7 were able to hold off the @entity12 attack for 27 more seconds yesterday			2
@entity8 could have hopped a flight with @entity14 back to the @entity15			2
but alas , it was n't to be			2
while we lament and scribble scenarios into our spreadsheets , here are five things to ruminate over today about this spectacular but surprising @entity22			2
you 're going to need two screens this week that 's because the last games of the group stages are played concurrently -- meaning , two games at the same time			1
it all began in 1982 when @entity31 was on the verge of making the knockout rounds			1
also in their group that year was @entity36 and @entity37			2
when they played , the @entity38 scored			1
the 1 - 0 result good enough to send both the @entity38 and the @entity37 through			2
so , the two teams basically stopped competing			2
had @entity36 scored two more goals ( or lost ) , @entity31 would have advanced			1
( it has to do with goal difference ) both @entity37 and @entity36 said , " no , not us			2
" but get this , there were no shots in the final 80 minutes ! so , @entity48 wised up			1
and the next @entity22 saw the first simultaneous matches for the last days of group play			1
on thursday , the @entity7 and @entity36 already know a 0 - 0 draw would get both through , so you do n't think ... ? nah , winning the group is too important			2
there 's a lot at stake today ( read : pride ) let 's go through today 's matches one by one - @entity61 v @entity60 : if you 're going to fixate on one match today , this is it			1
both are already going through			2
the only question is , which will top @entity69 ? bragging rights are a good enough reason to put up a great fight			0
@entity73 v. @entity74 : @entity74 is playing to not finish 32nd in a 32 - team field			1
the @entity74 ? they 've been more like @entity77			1
@entity78 has n't exactly set the field on fire either with its performance so far			0
still , there 's no doubt this matchup is one they 'll handily win			0
@entity14 v @entity86 : oh how the mighty have fallen			0
defending champs @entity14 have already been knocked out of the contest			0
so this encounter is basically a test to see if it can salvage some of its pride			0
@entity94 v. @entity95 : @entity94 needs to score to advance to the next round			1
not gon na be easy with @entity99 goalie @entity98 in the way			1
he 's shut out @entity78 and @entity74 , and inspired memes like the one where , @entity98 as @entity104 , stands before the goal proclaiming , " you shall not pass			1
that putrid racism in soccer ? yup , still there @entity48 is not happy after pictures surfaced of two men who showed up to the @entity36 v. @entity114 game in blackface and " @entity114 " written on their shirts			1
oh , at the same game , a @entity118 sympathizer ran onto the field			0
such a pity because the second half of saturday 's 2 - 2 draw was , in our opinion , the best 45 minutes of soccer in this tournament			0
do n't rule the @entity7 out just yet if only the @entity7 could have held on for a few more seconds			0
but it could n't yesterday			0
and @entity8 made history by racing down field and scoring what @entity131 said was the latest @entity22 goal ever in regulation			0
you 'd think @entity8 would be elated , but @entity137 's reaction to the dramatic equalizer was telling			0
he just looked down at the ground and walked back to midfield			0
@entity8 really needed a win after putting itself in an impossible hole with a 4 - 0 loss in its opening match against @entity36			1
so how will @entity145 play out ? @entity36 and the @entity7 each have four points , while @entity8 and @entity114 each have one			0
the @entity7 would prefer to just beat @entity36 , which would win the group			0
but if the @entity7 and @entity38 draw , both go through as they would if @entity114 and @entity8 tie			0
but if there are winners in each match , the loser of @entity7 - @entity36 and the winner of @entity114 - @entity8 will go to tiebreakers , the first of which is goal differential			1
confused ? let 's simplify it for you			0
just hope the @entity7 wins or draws against @entity36			0
what does the fox say ? @entity165 ! how about them @entity31 ? @entity31 's on the verge of qualifying for the knockout round after a 4 - 2 victory over @entity169 yesterday			1
four goals for a country that had n't scored at the finals in 28 years , had n't won a match in 32			1
you know how many @entity176 teams has scored four goals in a @entity22 match ? zero , until now			1
as for the @entity181 - @entity180 affair , the less said the better			0
the @entity180 looked tepid for 88 minutes before one of its youngest players scored the lone goal			0
you know what you call a match that does n't have a lot of shots ? @entity180 's coach called it " highly tactical affair			1

*monday* brings two sets of two matches played at the same time
in 1982 , @entity31 was *denied* a round of 16 appearance after a shady match
@entity48 looks into pictures of white men with black faces
*slumping* @entity74 appear to be easy prey for @entity73
