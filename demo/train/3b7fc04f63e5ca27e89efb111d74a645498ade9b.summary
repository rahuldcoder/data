-- a young woman , her face wet with tears , stares into the lens of a video camera			2
" believe me when i tell you , " she says , her voice breaking , " that if this was n't necessary , that if my dad knew that he could make us survive in @entity13 , he would have never brought us here			0
" she and two other young people , all of whom live in @entity17 , are the subjects of @entity20 's new film " @entity21			1
" the 19 - minute film was to premiere friday in @entity23 as part of the 2012 @entity25			1
held every 18 months , the event is hosted by video - sharing site @entity28 to celebrate the internet as a medium for film and bring together members of the @entity28 community who interact regularly online but rarely meet			1
@entity28 reports more than 8 million users and more than 65 million unique visitors per month			1
" so much in our daily lives now , we only meet people online , " said festival co-director @entity36			2
" we wanted to do something that was a hybrid between a conference and a film festival			2
" an emerging showcase for online film , this year 's festival features lectures by industry veterans like filmmaker @entity48 and @entity50 - nominated documentarian @entity49 plus workshops and screenings			2
thirteen films were selected for top awards out of a pool of 14,567 submissions from 147 countries			1
a panel of judges , including @entity20 and actors @entity60 and @entity62 , chose which films received the $ 5,000 prizes			1
the festival 's $ 25,000 grand prize was awarded thursday night to directing collective @entity66 for its lyrical three - minute film , " @entity68			2
" all the award winners -- films must be no longer than 20 minutes -- can be viewed online			1
" @entity21 " will be posted on @entity28 within the next few days , said @entity70 , the site 's global communications director			1
from ' @entity73 ' to ' limbo ' @entity20 won the grand prize at the first @entity25 , held in late 2010 , for his short film " @entity77 with @entity73			1
" the film documents ex-convict @entity80 's emotions as he must euthanize his beloved dog , @entity73 , who had been suffering from cancer			1
a poignant chronicle of love between human and pet , it has been viewed on @entity28 2.5 million times			1
but after winning the award , @entity20 felt guilty			1
" i think the project was exploiting the life of a friend and his suffering , " he said			0
so , in the months that followed , @entity20 came up with the idea to use his $ 25,000 prize money to create a film that might empower his subjects instead of simply chronicling their struggles			1
@entity20 , 30 , was working with students who benefit from the @entity102 when he stumbled upon the spark for " @entity21			1
" the @entity104 ) , a legal means of providing paperless illegal - immigrant youth access to higher education and financial aid , was signed into @entity110 law in october 2011			2
the federal version of the bill , which has stalled in the @entity113 , may become a divisive issue in the presidential election			0
three " dreamers " caught @entity20 's attention when they shared their life stories with him last year in a private meeting			1
all three are undocumented teenagers from @entity13 who are living with family members in @entity123 , @entity20 said			1
" all three of them came over the border [ between @entity13 and the @entity127 ] illegally at a very young age where they did n't have a choice , " he said			0
he declined to reveal names or other personal details about his subjects , who risk deportation			0
@entity20 saw a film taking shape from the narratives of the man and the two young women but could n't figure out how to construct it			1
then he noticed the first - person video being posted online during last year 's @entity141 uprisings in @entity142 and elsewhere , and it occurred to him that he could give his three subjects the tools to tell their own story			0
last september , @entity20 gave them point - and - shoot video cameras and asked that they use them to document their lives			1
" i quickly realized that the technology is there , that each individual is becoming his or her own journalist , " @entity20 said			1
" i thought , could there be a chance to empower the subject matter themselves to capture the story ? could they present their own film ? and i could just step out of the way and be there as a teacher ? " this approach , @entity20 believes , is in keeping with our mobile digital age , in which every person with a smartphone or a @entity172 camera is a potential journalist			1
" we 're in a time where all these resources and tools are available to everybody , " agreed @entity36 , the festival director			0
' giving the voiceless a voice ' after an introduction to filmmaking and three months of daily shooting , the three apprentice filmmakers presented @entity20 with more than 100 hours of intimate , sometimes gut - wrenching footage			2
one young narrator used her video camera to document her family 's painful search for her father after his arrest and deportation to @entity13			0
since he was deported , she and her family members have been trying to support themselves by baking and selling bread			0
" i know that under the law what we 're doing [ being in the @entity127 illegally ] is a crime , " says the teary young woman in the film			2
" but we 're just trying to survive			0
" she said the ordeal has given her new respect for her mother			0
" she 's the strongest woman i 've ever known			0
no matter what life throws at her , she 's always been able to get up			0
" the woman , who wants to be a lawyer , said that documenting herself on video was a learning process			0
" it was hard , " she said			0
" i did n't want to take the camera at times			0
" the other young woman in the film also hopes to become a lawyer , while the man aspires to be a journalist , @entity20 said			1
he and producer @entity216 spent countless hours pruning down the trio 's footage to make the film			0
@entity20 said he did n't make " limbo " as a political statement about the hot - button issue of immigration			2
" it was more about giving the voiceless a voice , " he said			0
while he ceded control of the narrative to the students , @entity20 still assigns his own meaning to the final cut			2
" it 's ultimately a social experiment , " he said			0
@entity20 said he hopes " @entity21 " can represent a new , unfiltered form of cinematic storytelling			1
" we 're at a point in time now where myself , documentarians and filmmakers should start finding ways to actually empower the story to tell itself rather than putting our own spin on it , " he said			0
" so let 's find ways to purify , simplify and get to the core of the experience rather than waiting for the perfect production or perfect way to articulate it			0
" after " @entity77 with @entity73 , " his conscience has been appeased			2
" i know for a moment in time , [ these ] three teens felt valued , " he said			0
" their voices were heard and i can sleep ok tonight			0
