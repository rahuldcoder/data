the dawning of the @entity1 is often seen as a time for new beginnings			0
but the first fixture of 2015 marked the end of a 22 - game winning streak for @entity8 which went down 2 - 1 to an all - action @entity10 side sunday			1
@entity11 opened the scoring from the penalty spot after 12 minutes but @entity8 were pegged back at the beginning of the second half when @entity17 's strike deflected off @entity18 and beyond @entity19			1
@entity20 then rose highest in the @entity8 box to power a header beyond @entity19 a little over 10 minutes later to give @entity10 a lead they would refuse to relinquish			1
@entity8 did create numerous chances for the equalizer but were foiled by a mixture of poor finishing , heroic defending and some spectacular goalkeeping from @entity10 's @entity29			1
@entity10 also had chances of its own as @entity8 piled forward in the latter stages			1
@entity17 in particular was guilty of being wasteful as he fired wide when through on @entity19			0
after the match , @entity8 boss @entity34 lamented his side 's inability to kill the game off when they were ahead			1
" there were key moments in which we could make the second goal , " @entity34 told the @entity8 website			1
" but it did n't materialize			0
you can not always be effective			0
" " we worked well and we had chances to score ( and ) we deserved at least a draw			0
" @entity10 boss , @entity49 , was in more ebullient mood when speaking to reporters			1
" this victory deserves a lot of credit , as does the fact that we came back from behind , " he said in comments carried by the @entity10 website			2
he continued , " i still believe that our biggest success is yet to come			0
it was a great win , but we still only have 34 points			0
it is not the time to celebrate anything , although of course the fans have to enjoy the victory			0
" the result meant @entity8 's great rivals @entity68 could have returned to the summit of @entity70 if it defeated @entity72 ' @entity71 later on sunday			1
but an own goal from defender @entity74 saw the @entity75 lose 1 - 0 despite a frantic second period in which they dominated			2
@entity68 remain a point behind @entity8 in second position and are ahead of third placed @entity79 , which won comfortably against @entity80 on saturday , only on goal difference			1
@entity10 , meanwhile , move up to fourth and into the final @entity83 spot			2
@entity85 @entity84 after a hectic period of fixtures over the festive period , @entity85 's leading clubs returned to action in the @entity84 sunday			2
@entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 all overcame lower - league opposition with varying degrees of comfort			2
@entity91 had to wait until the second half before goals from @entity98 and @entity99 secured a 2 - 0 victory over @entity101			1
@entity92 overcame @entity102 in far more comfortable fashion at @entity104			0
the @entity105 won 3 - 0 thanks to strikes from @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			2
@entity93 meanwhile had to come from behind to win 2 - 1 at home @entity112			1
@entity113 struck twice in the second half to spare @entity93 's blushes			2
although the competition is notorious for feats of giant killing over the years there were few shock results sunday			0
the most surprising was perhaps @entity121 @entity120 being downed 3 - 0 at home by third - tier side @entity123			0
elsewhere , @entity124 defeated @entity125 thanks to a solitary goal from @entity128 striker @entity127 while @entity129 was held at home to @entity131 of the @entity132			0
in the day 's late game , @entity133 comfortably eased aside @entity135 2 - 0 in a repeat of last year 's final			1
per @entity137 opened the scoring for the @entity139 in the first half while a late second from @entity142 rounded off a routine victory			0
@entity144 as in @entity85 , there were few surprises in @entity148 's premier cup competition			0
@entity149 defeated @entity150 2 - 0 with strikes from @entity152 and @entity153 while goals from @entity155 and @entity156 ensured @entity157 overcame @entity158 2 - 1			1
in perhaps the tie of the round , @entity159 were made to sweat for their 3 - 2 victory against @entity164 rivals @entity163			2
after taking a three - goal lead in the first half through @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity169 goals , @entity159 conceded two in the second period but held on to claim victory .			0

@entity10 defeat @entity8 2 - 1 at @entity174
result brings to an end @entity180 's 22 game winning streak
