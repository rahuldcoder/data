-- @entity1 has always been driven by his emotions -- for better or for worse -- but has he found a new level of maturity with @entity5 ? the double world champion has been schooled in the harsh lessons that @entity8 can mete out since he joined @entity10 's junior program when just 13 years old			1
but , despite this careful education by one of the most straight laced teams in @entity8 , the @entity12 boy racer can not help wearing his heart on his sleeve			2
there have been some heady highs and mesmerizing meltdowns in his eight - year career at the highest level of motorsport			0
fizzing with energy , he bounded into the sport in 2007 and refused to lie down when faced with @entity26 , a double world champion , as his feisty @entity10 teammate			2
with @entity26 gone after a single acrimonious season , @entity1 drove the @entity10 to the 2008 title with " my heart in my mouth			1
" at just 23 years old , he had sensationally clinched the championship at the last corner , of the last lap , of the last race to deny @entity38 's @entity37 -- and a seething crowd of home fans -- in @entity41			0
if 2008 was the young gun 's giddy zenith , the 2011 campaign was his gut - wrenching nadir			2
his long - distance relationship with @entity48 pop star @entity47 was more off than on and he had ditched his dad @entity49 as manager in favor of a high - profile agency			0
@entity1 teetered on the edge of controversy and despair			2
the torch paper was lit at the @entity57 when he was penalized by the race stewards			0
" it 's an absolute frickin ' joke , " he exclaimed			0
" maybe it 's because i 'm black			0
that 's what @entity62 says			0
" when @entity1 made a surprise switch to @entity5 in 2013 , the team would have been well aware that while his impulses propelled him on track , off it they could do more harm than good			1
" he is an emotionally driven individual , " @entity1 's biographer @entity70 tells @entity0			1
" you are never going to change that			0
" his emotions were all over the place in 2007 and 2008 , and in 2011 he was having big mood swings because of problems off track			0
" locked in another intense title fight in 2014 , the unpredictably passionate @entity1 had to sink or swim in the cauldron of competition			1
but , despite the swirling emotions of fighting mano a mano with his @entity5 teammate and close teenage friend @entity85 , @entity1 impressively kept his head above water to win a second world title with some style			1
so , what 's changed ? " he is essentially the same guy [ as in 2008 ] but he definitely seemed more in control of himself at the crucial pressure points on race days , " @entity70 adds			1
" he does seem to be in a calm place now and i 'd say he 's slightly more mature			2
" @entity1 's inner calm held out despite an @entity8 season filled with flashpoints that threatened to derail his peace of mind			2
the @entity5 rivals tested each other 's limits in @entity103 , where @entity1 had cut across @entity85 to retake the lead			1
in @entity57 -- where the pair happen to live in the same apartment block -- @entity85 was accused and cleared of blocking @entity1 during qualifying			1
in @entity110 , the @entity109 then refused to cede to team orders to let @entity85 pass			2
but the season 's big bust - up bloomed in @entity114			0
@entity85 was forced to apologize to @entity1 after he collided with the rear of his mercedes in an attempt to retake the lead , effectively putting his rival out of the race			1
" @entity1 has won the 2014 title in an entirely different set of circumstances to 2008 , " former @entity122 driver @entity121 tells @entity0			1
" he and @entity85 have been battling it out all season			2
" @entity1 has evolved to be able to deal with the stress			2
his destiny was in his own hands and he had the maturity to deal with it			0
" @entity1 always had the racing skill , the racing brain , the seat of the pants raw talent but he has matured into a driver that has come to a new level in terms of his own self - belief and self - confidence			0
" if @entity1 , who reconciled with @entity47 at the start of the year , has discovered a @entity145 - like mental state , an instinctive impulse inside the cockpit has also been key to winning a second world title			1
when it came to unlocking the pure pace from the @entity5 car in qualifying , @entity85 had the edge			1
the @entity154 out - qualified @entity1 12 - 9 , taking 11 pole positions to @entity1 's seven over the course of the year			2
" @entity85 is clearly very good at unleashing the big lap at just the crucial moment , " explains @entity70			1
" that induces @entity1 to over-strive sometimes and that happened on three or four occasions in qualifying this year			0
" but when the points were handed out on sundays , it was the @entity109 's racing nous that paid dividends as he racked up 11 victories compared to @entity85 's five			2
" even when @entity85 out - qualifies him , we see @entity1 is faster in the race because the tires wear , the track temperature changes , the fuel load changes , the car is never perfection , " @entity70 adds			1
" @entity1 is a very improvisational driver , he is someone who can just head into the race and improvise his way around anything the car does			0
" yet even @entity1 would probably have struggled to improvise his way around the loss of engine power at the season finale in @entity178 , where @entity85 's title hopes ultimately ended			1
falling backwards through the field from second to 14th was an agonizing way to lose the title but the 29 - year - old was generously gracious in defeat			0
this may not have been a world title winning season for the son of 1982 winner @entity190 but it has been a year of growth for the driver who was unflatteringly dubbed " @entity194 " -- for his pop star good looks -- by his peers			1
" to be up against @entity1 , the level was incredibly high and so i also had to find and deliver the next level , " @entity85 reflected in @entity178			1
@entity70 , who has also followed @entity85 's career closely since he made his @entity8 debut with @entity202 in 2006 , agrees			1
" @entity85 's definitely stepped up , " the @entity57 editor for @entity204 adds			2
" i 'd say he has discovered a core of steel within himself and his composure is very impressive			0
" even though he has been trounced by @entity208 he has pulled himself back together and gone straight back out and given him a hard time all over again			0
" @entity1 ' level has lent @entity85 a credibility that is greater than it would have been without @entity1			1
" @entity5 is expected to be the dominant force in @entity8 when the new season rolls into @entity215 , @entity216 for the opening race next march			0
@entity218 -- the only other team to win races in 2014 -- will be hot on the champion 's heels while a resurgent @entity202 -- the only team to deny @entity5 pole position -- is out to go one better on race day next season			1
but given the hybrid @entity5 engine 's power advantage over the rest of the field , @entity1 and @entity85 are set fair for another internal team tussle for the victory laurels			1
the question is , can @entity85 dig deep over the winter and reach another level to prevent @entity1 winning a third world title ? " @entity85 has peaked , " argues @entity121			1
" this year he used every element of his driving skill and his mental capacity to take the championship to @entity208			0
he 's not going to get any better			0
" the feeling is that @entity1 has won this championship as a man in development			0
this win has been so important because he will take from this and be a better driver in my opinion			0
" be prepared to see more domination			0
" the quicksilver combination of @entity1 and @entity5 now has the chance to emulate @entity218 's four - year era of dominance that was snuffed out by 2014 's major rule change , which focused on engine technology			1
" this is a golden opportunity for @entity1 , " says @entity70			1
" and it 's probably one he 's never going to get again			0
" he 's the favorite in 2015 because the @entity5 gap to the others is so big that even if it 's reduced next year , it 's probably still going to be there			1
" it was looking for a time that @entity264 winning all those championships with @entity218 meant @entity1 ' was going to be the great career that never was			0
" now he 's in a position to make it a great career and if he keeps winning titles he will be recognized as one of the giants			0
" @entity121 , who raced to @entity8 victories in the late 70s and early 80s , is even tipping @entity1 to succeed a very special member of the @entity274 stable			1
" @entity275 is my idol as the greatest @entity57 driver ever , " says @entity121			1
" he won the titles for @entity5 in 1954 and 1955			2
" @entity1 can go on and match that			2
if he does , his career will be held in great regard and respect			0
" what marks you out as a great driver is moving forward and winning multiple world championships			0
" but what is more critical is winning titles in different cars with different teams			0
@entity275 has done that and now so has @entity1			2

@entity1 added a second world title to his 2008 crown with victory for @entity5 in 2014
" @entity1 is more mature , " says the @entity12 racer 's biographer @entity70
teammate and title rival @entity85 has raised credibility with his 2014 *performance*
@entity1 can match @entity275 's two world titles for @entity5 in 2015 , says former racer @entity121
