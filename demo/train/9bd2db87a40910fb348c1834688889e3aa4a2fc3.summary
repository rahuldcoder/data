-- last year , 27 - year - old @entity1 declared that he needed a year off of work			1
" i love traveling , " said @entity1 , who works for the software company @entity3			1
" so here , if you need to take time off , you send an e-mail notification , and they say , ' have a good time ! ' " @entity1 took his boss up on an offer for a leave of absence and moved to @entity13			0
he 's now back in the office , working in sales , after his year off			1
" they recognized that work - life balance , for many people , is just the definition of being a happy worker , " @entity1 said			1
@entity21 paid vacation -- as long as you still get your work done -- is one of the many perks @entity1 enjoys at @entity27 , @entity28 - based @entity3			1
the company also provides its young staff members with a massage chair , a pingpong table , a tricked - out gaming suite including " @entity34 , " and a monthly cookout served by the boss			2
gen - y'ers : delaying adulthood @entity3 ceo @entity39 , who founded the company in 1999 , says that catering to gen - y workers is smart business			1
thirty - nine of his 65 employees are under the age of 32			1
" if you create an environment like we have here , which is a fun place to come work , and you engage them and you really capture their attention , they 're fantastic employees , " @entity39 said			1
who is this new breed of worker , and why do companies like @entity3 pamper them ? @entity59 , or millennials , make up roughly 50 million 18 - to 30 - year - olds			1
according to a 2010 @entity64 study on social trends , this generation is on course to become the most educated in history and , in a decade or so , will account for nearly half the employees in the world			1
dr. @entity70 , a @entity71 professor , has conducted extensive research on innovation and millennials			2
he says one defining characteristic of millennials is their short attention spans			2
" i think that @entity59 does not expect necessarily to be tied to a job , " @entity70 said			2
that 's a gutsy decision for a generation with 13 percent unemployment			2
" the big one i hear about , and i 'm guilty too , is a sense of entitlement , " said @entity59 consultant @entity81 , who rakes in up to $ 25,000 per speech teaching @entity84 companies how to work with his generation			1
" it 's showing up and just feeling like people owe you things , " the 33 - year - old says			1
@entity81 adds that some millennials also have a hard time dealing with negative feedback			2
he says it stems from the way many were raised			0
" the reality is , we 've had parents who have told us how great we are since we were kids , you know			0
we listen to @entity103 to get smarter			0
we go to school and suffer from grade inflation , and if we did n't get an a , we went and negotiated			0
we 've built up our self - esteem , and the result is , we ca n't deal with adversity , " @entity81 said			0
@entity59 : marriage ideal but parenthood the priority why would anyone even want to hire millennials ? are they worth the trouble ? " we want to make a difference from day one , which is totally huge			1
we show up , and that 's why we think we should be vice president , " joked @entity81			0
" @entity59 brings a lot of valuable skill sets in terms of thinking outside the box			2
we do n't know what status quo means , but we know that if something does n't work , we 're going to speak up about it			0
" @entity81 has words of wisdom for companies like @entity3 that employ a multitude of gen - yers : " when millennials show up at the office , you have to provide specific examples of what you expect			1
and the reason is , we often lack real world experience			0
so we may have degrees and big expectations , but we do n't necessarily know what ' business casual ' means			0
" you have to give feedback to millennials at least once a month			0
other generations were taught if your boss is talking to you , you 're doing something wrong			0
millennials were taught the exact opposite : if your boss is n't talking to you , you 're doing something wrong			0
" @entity3 boss @entity39 swears by his staff			2
" i think the biggest thing is that they bring a new level of dedication that we have n't seen in the past			0
" and his gen - y employees , including @entity1 , may have a better perspective on life than generations before them			1
" i want to make sure i 'm doing things that make me happy , " @entity1 said			0
" so if it means maybe starting a little bit later down a long career path , then i 'm absolutely going to take that opportunity to enjoy life			0
" perhaps @entity81 sums up the @entity59 work attitude best : " the truth is , millennials just want something they can put on @entity173 ! " @entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			1
