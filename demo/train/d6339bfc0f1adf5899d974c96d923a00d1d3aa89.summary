-- it 's your first day at university and you 've got 15 minutes to get to room 9 - 209			2
easy , right ? what if the campus is a labyrinth of unfamiliar buildings stretching over a whopping 168 acres ? suddenly , finding that room feels a bit like locating a particular grain of sand at the beach			2
never fear , @entity14 is here -- a flying robot that guides you to your destination , pointing out important landmarks along the way			1
it might seem like a scene from a sci - fi film , but at the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , these high - tech drones are helping students navigate the maze - like site -- and could soon be escorting the rest of us around difficult environments too			1
" @entity24 campus is quite complex , it has a lot of buildings , and sometimes people do get lost , " said @entity30 , director of the institute 's @entity31 , which created the futuristic device			1
" we had a lot of new students on campus , and saw this as a good opportunity to test it , " he added			2
" it 's a mere step towards using @entity14 in more complex situations , such as search - and - rescue missions			1
" only a @entity14 away so how does this floating tour guide work ? after downloading the @entity14 app to their smartphones , visitors call the robot , which tracks their gps location and flies to the rescue			1
they then type the room number into their mobiles , and @entity14 guides them there -- pointing out landmarks using a small speaker			2
watch : flying robots ' aerial acrobatics cruising at a leisurely 6 kilometers per hour ( 3.7 mph ) , the quadropcopter -- featuring four propellers -- has enough battery power to last 15 minutes			0
in - built sonar sensors ensure @entity14 does n't crash into obstacles			1
and should the visitor fall behind at any point , the clever copter will wait for them to catch up -- much like a real - life tour guide			1
" people were having a lot of fun with it -- it 's kind of like an unusual travel companion , " said @entity30			0
" it can travel 1 mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) , but this could easily be a lot more if you have a bigger battery			0
at the moment it 's more of an experimental project			0
" high - flyer indeed , it 's hoped that in the future , @entity14 could be developed into everything from city guides for tourists , to rescue robots for survivors of disaster sites			1
featuring an in - built camera , the device could relay footage back to others -- particularly useful in rescue missions			1
or it may link - up to the user 's phone , giving them a bird 's eye view of the journey			0
watch : robots inspired by birds the researchers at @entity24 's @entity31 are looking at other ways drones could be used in everyday life			2
" drones have had quite bad press because of the military implications , " explained @entity30			0
" but this project this is about helping people			0
" we are trying to look at the positive side of drones -- people controlling drones , rather than the skepticism around drones controlling people			0
" senseable design ? @entity14 is part of a bigger program at @entity31 , exploring how people could use new technology in urban environments			1
other projects include robotic bartenders , or devices to measure road rage while driving			0
" we have many applications that will help us carry out our everyday tasks , " said @entity30			0
" i think in the case of @entity14 -- and drones in general -- people find it quite intriguing to have a flying companion			2
" could skycall be our high - tech guardian angel of the future ? at the very least , it could make the first day of university a lot less daunting .			0

*introducing* @entity14 , the flying robot turned *personal* tour guide
students at @entity24 have been using drone to navigate maze - like campus
@entity152 is *brainchild* of @entity24 scientists , hope to use technology in rescue missions
