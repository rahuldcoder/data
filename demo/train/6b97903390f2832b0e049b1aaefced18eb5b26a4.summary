-- a thick pall of chemical smoke hung over a crowd in @entity4 on friday afternoon			0
people ran , covering their noses and mouths to escape yet another volley of tear gas			1
the same scene was being played out elsewhere in @entity4 , in @entity11 and @entity12			0
and several weeks back , @entity14 police used tear gas to try to quell protests there			1
it is one of the most common ways to used to disperse protests -- but not everyone runs			0
in both @entity14 and @entity24 , some protesters stopped to pick up canisters , and posted photographs online			1
a few inches long , blue and silver , they include warning labels and then a set of initials : @entity31 , followed by " made in the @entity32 " the photograph posted in @entity14 was of a 40 mm riot @entity35 smoke projectile , made by a company called @entity37 , which describes itself as a " tactical weapons company " and is based in @entity39 , @entity40			1
@entity31 's website describes the projectile as " a launched burning extended - range single projectile round that dispenses smoke or chemical agents via rapid burning			2
used effectively during riots at safe stand - off distances to disperse groups or deny areas			2
" its warning label reads : " danger : do not fire directly at person ( s )			0
severe injury or death may result			0
" that warning is apparently not always followed			0
@entity58 died in @entity14 on january 17 , three days after being hit by a tear gas grenade at close range			1
the 32 - year - old was a photographer for the @entity63			2
on thursday , a similar picture was posted on @entity65 by a someone in @entity24 , only this time it was of a grenade , not a canister			1
it , too , was made by csi			2
the grenade appears to be an " @entity71 " that " discharges a high volume of smoke and chemical agent through multiple emission ports			0
specifically for outdoor use , " the website says			0
@entity31 's website ( www.less-lethal.com ) bills the company as the " premier engineering , manufacturing and supply company of tactical munitions and crowd control devices globally to armed forces , law enforcement , corrections and homeland security agencies			0
" clients include the @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , and the @entity32 @entity94 , as well as @entity95 and @entity96 -- both of which are weapons companies based in @entity99			1
on january 1 , @entity100 died in the @entity101 during a weekly protest against a security barrier being built in @entity100			0
@entity99 considers the protests violent and illegal			2
@entity105 died of severe asphyxiation and cardiac arrest after @entity99 soldiers fired tear gas canisters into the crowd			1
in april 2009 , @entity105 's brother was killed participating in the same weekly protest when a tear gas canister struck him directly in the chest			1
a spokesman for csi says the company is operating well within the law by selling tear gas to countries like @entity14 and @entity24			1
according to the @entity121 , riot control agents are not considered chemical weapons unless used during a time of war			2
this means that it 's perfectly legal to manufacture and sell tear gas , so long as countries do n't stockpile a large amount of the chemical compounds			1
the spokesman declined to say how much tear gas csi had sold to countries in northern @entity134 , but said it is a small company			1
he also said csi could not control how its products are used once sold			2
social media reaction to the " made in the @entity91 " label on the canisters was scathing , with some suggesting it meant the @entity32 government itself was somehow involved in suppressing the protests			1
some @entity65 users demanded to know " why so many weapons used against @entity24 protesters read ' made in the @entity32 '			1
" others advised " maybe @entity32 weapons manufacturers should stop printing " made in @entity32 " on their weapons especially the ones we send to brutal autocrats			1
" whether @entity31 is operating within the law has n't stopped protestors from voicing their dissatisfaction with the company			0
after @entity105 died in @entity99 , demonstrators gathered outside @entity159 ' @entity158 offices			2
@entity159 owns a majority interest in @entity31			0
the protesting group -- the @entity162 for the @entity163 -- demanded that @entity31 stop providing tear gas that could be used on @entity165 by @entity99 forces			1
@entity99 authorities are still investigating @entity100 's death			2
according to the @entity170 , there are several compounds that are considered to be riot - control agents			0
two of the most common are chloroacetophenone ( @entity174 ) and @entity175 ( @entity35 )			0
others include chloropicrin ( @entity178 ) , bromobenzylcyanide ( @entity179 ) , and dibenzoxazepine ( @entity180 )			0
riot control agents temporarily disable those affected by causing irritation to the eyes , mouth , throat , lungs , and skin			0
long - lasting exposure to these compounds can cause blindness and chemical burning of the throat and lungs resulting in death , as well as respiratory failure , which can also result in death .			0

tear gas canisters fired at @entity24 protesters are marked " made in the @entity32 "
combined @entity37 also has sold tear gas to @entity14 and @entity99
some @entity65 users demand why @entity32 - made weapons are being used against protesters
