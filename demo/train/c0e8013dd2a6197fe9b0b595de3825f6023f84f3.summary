is the fastest - growing musical genre out there			1
with djs like @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 leading the pack , electronic music 's popularity has ballooned in the past decade			1
from festivals to radio airplay , social media and even collaborating with a-list musicians , @entity3 artists are getting a lot of attention -- and money -- from all over the place			1
the numbers do n't lie			0
so far , @entity25 ' top 10 edm artists have racked up a combined $ 268 million this year , an 11 % increase from 2013 , with top earner @entity10 bringing in $ 66 million			1
how did this musical genre grow from a small , cult following into this global phenomenon we feel today ? how have those who 've stuck with it from the beginning grown with it ? and where is it going next ? to obtain these answers we headed to one of the biggest festivals in the world , @entity42 , to meet up with some of the genre 's key players : @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity45 , and @entity3 's newest dynamic duo , @entity47			1
the origins of @entity3 electronic dance music is not a new genre			1
in fact , it 's been around for more than three decades			1
@entity11 , whose dj days began in @entity54 in the late 80 's , recalls how the house / electronic music movement began when the disco era was ending			1
" there was a movement called ' disco sucks ' , " he says			0
" it was a shame to like disco , but then there was no music to dance to , so some @entity9 started to use old disco records , but the b - sides and the acapellas , and we began producing beats with drum machines			1
" simply put , djs snuck disco music into people 's ears			1
" i remember buying those records and the label ( vinyl sticker ) , " says @entity11			0
" ( djs ) would use old records and print on top of it , melt it , and print on the top ... very low quality , this was super , super underground			1
" in other words , disco music is @entity3 's ancestor			1
" i started in ' 88 to play @entity93 music , it was a huge revolution for me			2
i went to @entity94 and i saw a dj on stage and that was crazy at the time			0
i was one of the really respected and famous djs in @entity54 , but they would never show me			2
a dj on stage and people dancing and facing the @entity9 , looking at him ? i was like ' wow ! ' " says @entity11 , as if still surprised to this day			0
a few years later , in the early 90 's , in the @entity101 , @entity12 began his journey to becoming @entity12			2
he also started when the genre was completely underground			2
a trip to @entity108 , some parties and general love for music got him interested in becoming a dj. " back then , first of all , we all played vinyl records , so even when you knew the track , you could not get it			2
everything was very exclusive , " says @entity12 in his dressing room , 300 meters away from the main stage of @entity42			0
" that 's the big difference with nowadays , because when you jam to a track you already know what it is , and then right away you have the song in your phone or your laptop ... that was a very magical period because you played a track and people said ' i know this track , ' but they still could n't find it			2
that was very special , " says @entity12 , as his staff calls him			0
it 's hard to pinpoint a date and location to the beginnings of @entity3			1
some say it began in @entity136 and @entity94 , others make a case that it started in @entity138 , in the @entity139 for @entity11 , both continents played a role , " this is what happened ... it was born in the @entity139 , but the @entity144 made it trendy			0
and it became a massive movement in @entity148 , but never in the @entity139 , which is crazy "			0
he later adds , " i think @entity139 is always creating the new movement and then the @entity144 has this genius of taking this concept and making it accessible to the masses			0
" from underground to the masses recently , @entity11 has had mainstream success by collaborating with pop stars like @entity159 , and @entity160 , for whom he produced the best - selling single ' i got ta feeling ' in 2009			0
other successful djs , including likes of @entity10 and @entity165 , have also found success this way			1
" i love collaborating outside of my space , " says @entity45 , who has worked with artists like will.i.am and @entity169			0
" when i got into the dance culture and started producing the music i kept on thinking how to do something unique or different than what the status quo does			1
" for @entity3 , collaborations may have attracted listeners , but the internet and its subsequent components , i.e. social media , apps and music sharing programs , have played essential roles in getting more			1
nowadays , in the digital era , success is measured in followers , video hits , downloads , hashtags , tweets , retweets and likes			0
" for us it ( social media ) has played a very big role , " says @entity193 of the duo @entity47			0
" we can make a new track and with one click , it 'll be spread all over the world			0
twenty years ago you had a vinyl , and that vinyl had to go to a distributor , and six months later maybe another country would have the vinyl , " adds the other half of the duo , @entity202			0
" all we did for one year is talk to djs by @entity210 and somehow that got us our first gig			1
social media has been the biggest factor in our career			0
" in @entity148 and the @entity216 , mainly , there are an increasing number of electronic music festivals ; events that gather people from all over the world and celebrate in unison			1
the @entity42 festival celebrated outside of @entity224 , @entity225 , gathered 160,000 people from 75 countries this year , according to the organizers			2
" it 's like a theme park for adults , " says @entity193			2
not all genres can brag about selling out festivals with over 150,000 attendees , and do it in a matter of minutes			0
sure , some could mention the @entity238 and the @entity239 of the world , but they offer musical variety			0
from pop to rock , rap to indie and even country			0
@entity3 festivals offer only @entity3			1
" when i 'm on stage i 'm looking out and seeing everyone putting up their flags from hundreds of different countries , representing hundreds of different cultural lifestyles			0
they 're all jumping in unison forming almost like one entity , one spiritual being , " adds @entity45 , who , besides his music , is known for his selfies with the crowds , riding inflatable rafts , and caking one lucky fan per show			2
if you 're confused about the latter , it 's a @entity45 trademark , where he throws a whole cake to someone in the audience			2
based on reactions seen from the fans , they love it			0
" when they get caked in the face , the first thing they do is immediately turn around to make sure that everyone else saw that they got caked , it 's a very bizarre thing			2
people do n't get it , " says @entity45 , full of enthusiasm			0
naturally , @entity3 was unlikely to become this popular without generating incredible amounts of money			1
a recent report stated that @entity3 is a $ 6.2 billion global industry			1
most of the money comes from festivals , @entity290 club dates and other global club gigs			2
all this peaked the interest of ad men and the big brands they represent			0
in fact , some have already made moves and are sponsoring festivals , events , and others have djs featured in commercials			2
business is good , but is the music getting better ? @entity3 has been highly criticized			1
many see @entity3 as an art that lost its purity			1
" it 's an evolution			0
the thing is that , every musical genre starts from the underground , gets trendy , then it becomes popular , and then it dies or it is reinvented in a different way , " says @entity11			0
many wonder if @entity3 is at his highest point			1
is this its climax ? or will it end soon , just like @entity319 did ? " they 've been asking me that since 1994 , ' is it going to end ? ' i always say i do n't know			0
it keeps evolving , every year something new comes up , and now it 's at the highest it ever has been , so now i do n't know how much higher and how much better it 'll get , " says @entity12			1
" it has been more than 20 - 25 years that this music is existing , so it 's already amazing			1

electronic dance music ( @entity3 ) has become a global phenomenon
according to @entity25 , the genre 's top 10 djs earned a combined $ 268 million this year
@entity10 , who earned $ 66 million , topped this year 's list
