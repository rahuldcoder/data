-- two rights groups launched a stinging critique wednesday on @entity4 's freedom of expression record , citing a heavy clampdown on critics and activists since @entity8 returned to the presidency			1
the reports by @entity11 and @entity12 highlight changes to the law that they say have helped authorities stifle dissent			1
opinion : @entity19 and @entity4 's surreal ' justice ' " in the year since @entity8 's return to the presidency in may 2012 , the @entity4 government has unleashed a crackdown on civil society unprecedented in the country 's @entity28 history , " @entity12 said in its report			1
" the authorities have introduced a series of restrictive laws , harassed , intimidated , and in several cases imprisoned political activists , interfered in the work of nongovernmental organizations ( @entity37 ) and sought to cast government critics as clandestine enemies , thereby threatening the viability of @entity4 's civil society			1
" opinion : why @entity19 matters at least two new laws have been introduced and 11 amended in the past year , according to @entity11 , including broad provisions that allow for " arbitrary interference " with the rights to freedom of expression , association and assembly			2
as a result , the space for political opposition and other forms of dissent is " rapidly shrinking , " it said			0
" these recent legal initiatives have the declared aim of ensuring public order and the protection of the rights of citizens , " it said			0
" their effect has been the opposite : prominent government critics , opposition voices , watchdogs and ordinary individual protesters ( on a wide range of issues ) have all seen their rights restricted over the course of the last year			0
" this is happening even though these rights are explicitly guaranteed by the nation 's constitution and international human rights treaties to which @entity4 is party , @entity11 points out			1
opinion : @entity4 's civil society crackdown continues two of the new laws " clearly seek to limit , or even end , independent advocacy and other @entity37 work , " @entity12 said			1
one , the " foreign agents " law , requires any group receiving foreign funding and engaging in " political activities " to register as a " foreign agent , " the report said			0
inspections conducted by authorities to enforce this law " appeared aimed , at minimum , to intimidate civil society activists " and could potentially be used to force some groups to either end certain types of work or close altogether , it said			0
internet content has also been subjected to new legal restrictions , and another law on freedom of assembly imposes limits on public demonstrations and drastic fines on those who violate it , it added			0
@entity4 's government has not yet responded to the reports			1
@entity118 critic in court meanwhile , the trial of prominent @entity118 critic and opposition leader @entity121 resumed in a court in @entity124 , a city about 500 miles northeast of @entity126			1
@entity121 , a popular anti-corruption blogger , is accused of embezzling $ 510,000 worth of timber when he worked for the governor of the @entity124 area			2
he faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million rubles ( $ 32,000 ) if convicted			0
@entity121 says the charges are revenge for his criticism of senior @entity4 officials and allegations of corruption by managers of state - run firms , the official @entity133 news agency reported			1
the case was previously closed by prosecutors in spring 2012 for lack of evidence , the @entity12 report said			2
@entity121 has been detained several times by @entity4 authorities over his political protest activities			1
in one example , in october of last year he was detained and charged after staging a one - man protest over police torture in front of the headquarters of the @entity155 in @entity126 , @entity12 said			0
permission is not needed to stage a one - man protest			0
@entity121 told a court that after he finished his protest , a group of journalists followed him to ask questions , " at which point he was detained and charged with organizing an unauthorized rally , " the report said			0
@entity11 's report also raises concerns about past court cases brought against @entity121			1
@entity8 's election to a third term as president in may 2012 came less than six months after parliamentary elections sparked the largest protests seen in decades in @entity4			2
the issue of free speech in @entity4 was thrust into the international spotlight last year with the trial of three members of the punk band @entity19 , a legal action widely condemned by rights groups			2
all three women were convicted of hooliganism for performing a song critical of @entity8 in a @entity187 cathedral , in a brief but provocative protest action			0
two are still in prison .			0

new : trial resumes of @entity118 critic @entity121 , on charges of embezzlement
@entity11 and @entity12 accuse @entity4 of stifling dissent
@entity12 : government clampdown is " unprecedented in the country 's @entity28 history "
@entity4 's government has not responded to the criticisms
