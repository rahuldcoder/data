-- the first complete gorilla genome has been mapped by scientists giving fresh insights into our own origins			1
@entity6 are the last of the genus of living great apes ( humans , chimpanzees , gorillas and orang - utans ) to have their dna decoded , offering new perspectives on their evolution and biology			1
" the gorilla genome is important because it sheds light on the time when our ancestors diverged from our closest evolutionary cousins around six to 10 million years ago , " says @entity18 , postdoctoral fellow at the @entity19 , @entity20 and lead author of the report			1
" it also lets us explore the similarities and differences between our genes and those of gorilla , the largest living primate , " he added			2

initial findings have revealed that 15 % of the gorilla genome is closer to human dna than to our nearest evolutionary relative , the chimpanzee			2
researchers found that genes relating to sensory perception , hearing and brain development showed " accelerated evolution " in all three , but particularly in humans and gorillas			0
having the entire length of the gorilla genome now means scientists can start to compare all the four great apes at every position on the genome , @entity18 says			2
it forms the baseline , he says , from which to move forwards and really explore why and when our genes and those of the great apes diverged			0
" did it happen quite quickly or was it something that gradually happened ? at the moment we do n't know , " he said			0
" it could have been some climatic change that separated humans in the east of @entity78 from chimpanzees in the forest -- that 's an idea some have floated			2
if we can see some imprint of it in the genome that would be very , very useful information			0
" scientists used the dna of a female western lowland gorilla ( called @entity88 ) who resides at @entity89			1
in the wild , it is the most widespread species of gorilla , according to the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) , with a estimated population of 100 - 200,000 individuals			1
the majority are found in @entity98 , @entity99 , west @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
its cousin , the eastern lowland gorilla , is less prevalent ( fewer than 20,000 individuals ) and can only be found in the rainforests of the eastern @entity100 , says @entity94			1
the research is published in the science journal @entity111 .			0

scientists have completed the @entity86 map of an @entity78 western lowland gorilla
research hopes to shed light on human evolution and biology
western lowland gorilla population estimated to be 100 - 200,000 individuals in the wild
