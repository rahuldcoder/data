@entity0 -- a new terrorism warning system will provide the public with information on specific threats , replacing the color - coded alerts put in place after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , homeland security secretary @entity2 said wednesday			1
in announcing the new system at @entity0 's @entity12 , commonly known as @entity12 , @entity10 said a main goal was to provide better understanding of the nature of the specific threat , what people should do in reaction to it and how they could help security officials in responding			1
" it will provide alerts based on specific , credible information about potential terrorist activity , " @entity10 said , adding that the alerts would contain " as many details as we can provide			1
" right now , she said , there is no threat that would reach the level to warrant one of the new alerts , which will take effect on april 26			1
@entity10 made the announcement in the city where more than 2,700 people were killed when two hijacked planes crashed into the @entity40 's twin towers			1
she was joined by @entity0 police commissioner @entity42 and @entity43 rep. @entity43 , the chairman of the @entity44 , who both praised the new @entity45 as an upgrade that enhances current security efforts			0
however , sen. @entity48 of @entity49 , the top @entity50 on the @entity51 , cautioned that the new system must " effectively disseminate threat information in a timely manner and provide sound guidance to the public and affected homeland security partners on the actions they should take to protect themselves and the nation			2
" @entity62 urged @entity10 's department " to keep communication lines open with our state and local homeland security officials and with the private sector so that implementation of the system meets the vision " set by the secretary			1
the new system has two levels of alerts , compared to the previous system 's five levels , @entity10 said			1
the two alert levels of the new system are " elevated threat , " which " warns of a credible terrorist threat " to the @entity80 ; and " imminent threat , " which " warns of a credible , specific and impending terrorist threat , " according to a @entity84 statement			2
any alert will automatically expire after a two - week period , although they could be extended if new information shows a threat persists , @entity84 said			0
@entity10 told reporters in a morning briefing that the alerts posted on a department website -- www.dhs.gov/alerts -- will provide details to show the nature , location and other information about terrorism threats			1
therefore , she said , a specific warning may apply to a particular address , community , city or region , rather than the non-specific general warnings of the color - coded system			0
alerts also will be announced by her office and made public via traditional media such as television announcements and radio broadcasts , as well as social media , @entity10 said			2
she conceded that the color - coded system " has faded in utility except for late - night comics , " noting that the warning level at airports had been at orange since 2006			0
" that 's one of the reasons why people ( stopped ) paying attention to them , " @entity10 said			1
instead of a constant state of undefined warning , she said , the new system will react to actual threats			0
" we do n't want people to live in fear , " she said			0
" we want people to live in a state of alert and awareness			0
" her department is asking the public to be on alert for any suspicious activity , incorporating the @entity138 's trademark slogan " if you see something , @entity141 " into its alerts			2
evaluating the current threat for wednesday under the old system , the @entity84 put it at yellow , or elevated			0
under the new system , it does not warrant an alert			0
