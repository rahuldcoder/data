april , the cruelest month : time for tax deadlines and tax policy follies			2
hence , the resurrection of the so - called @entity3			1
named after @entity5 , who said it was an outrage that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary , the proposal is designed to ensure that the really rich -- those with annual reported taxable incomes of more than $ 1 million -- pay an " effective tax rate " of 30 %			1
the idea is another attempt by president @entity14 to restore some measure of progressivity to the tax code			1
baffled and blocked by the mythical @entity18 , @entity14 has been unable to restore the top marginal tax rate on those reporting more than $ 250,000 a year to their @entity22 levels , a top rate of 39.6 % from its current 35 %			1
that seemingly modest proposal was a centerpiece of @entity14 's landslide 2008 election campaign			2
why ? because the idea has three fatal flaws			1
it 's dead on arrival			2
the rule has no chance of getting through the @entity37 , even it can get through the @entity38			0
and if history is any guide , any form of tax increase , on anyone , will not bring votes to any person or party in november , so there are no political points to score here			2
the practical political fact sits alongside some pressing fiscal facts : @entity51 is running massive deficits			0
our spending is too high			0
our revenues are too low			0
we are a @entity56 waiting to happen			0
meanwhile , inequality of all forms is getting worse			0
we need to do something , not nothing			0
empty april symbolism is nothing			0
the @entity3 wo n't help solve the real problems			1
it wo n't help the fiscal problem because it is a drop in the bucket			2
the most optimistic projections are that the rule might raise $ 50 billion a year			2
that 's unlikely , because people plan around tax increases , but even if we get it , it is about 3 % of the projected $ 1.5 trillion deficit			1
the rule could only be meaningful if it were some kind of first step			0
but first step toward what ? history shows that marginal tax rates were raised on the very highest bracket to 94 % in the midst of @entity79 also shows that almost no one paid tax in this bracket			2
why do it then ? because a top rate of 94 % made lower rates of 50 % and 70 % look more palatable			0
is the @entity3 a first step toward lowering the 30 % flat rate to those making more than $ 250,000 , or raising other middle - class taxes ? it is hard to see anything very good happening here			1
the @entity3 , even if enacted , wo n't work because it wo n't really affect @entity5 ! the really , really rich in @entity51 do n't pay high taxes because they do n't report high incomes			1
and they do n't report high incomes for perfectly legal reasons			2
as i have been writing for decades now , the really , really rich , including @entity102 's " @entity101 , " follow the three simple steps of @entity104 101 : buy , borrow and die			0
by buying assets that rise in value without producing cash , the really , really rich benefit from " unrealized appreciation " that need not go down on any tax form			0
this is key to the business and investment strategy of @entity5 's @entity115			1
when the really , really rich want to consume , they borrow , also tax - free under the income tax			0
to cash it all out , the really , really rich die , like we all do -- and then the so - called stepped - up basis on death means that their heirs can sell off assets and pay off debts , tax - free			1
we can and should attack @entity128 and make the really , really rich pay some tax			1
we should address the tax benefits of unrealized appreciation and , even more so , of borrowing			0
we can do so , surprisingly simply , by a progressive consumption tax , as i and others , like @entity134 and @entity135 , have advocated for years			1
that 's real reform that would really affect @entity5			1
as such , i suppose it must wait until april passes .			0

the @entity3 is designed to make sure those who make over $ 1 million pay more tax
@entity145 : the idea has three fatal flaws
he says that even if it 's enacted , it would n't really affect *namesake* @entity5
@entity145 : real reform can be *achieved* with a progressive consumption tax
