-- do n't you just hate the type of person who smugly informs you , " i do n't watch tv , " like that 's something to be proud of ? they think they 're so great with all their fancy book learning			1
what they do n't realize is that tv is n't for dummies -- there 's tons of educational programming available -- you just need to know what to watch			2
i mean , you can learn your abcs with " @entity29 's " @entity20 , how to make gnocchi with @entity22 , and the ins and outs of prettying up your home with any number of programs on @entity28			2
television is also a great romance resource			0
think of all the great tv twosomes we 've seen over the years -- @entity34 , @entity35 & @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 ... but not all tv personalities set such a sincerely loving example			2
it 's also a good place to learn which type of guy you should avoid			1
here are a few examples : @entity46 ( " @entity47 " ) : few men can pull off lavender argyle , but @entity46 is definitely one of them			1
@entity50 and sinister , when @entity53 ( @entity54 ) like you , it 's as though you 've been inducted into a secret society of two			1
it 's you against the world and the @entity54 will bring out a dark side you might not have even realized you possessed			0
whip smart with a caustic wit , he 'll charm you all the while tucking away your secrets for use at a later date			2
and use them he will			0
because when a @entity54 tires of you , he wo n't just say " see ya , " he 'll decimate you			0
@entity50 ( " @entity68 " ) : some boys take longer than usual to grow out of their @entity71 - wannabe phase			1
actor @entity76 , playing what the tabloids would have you believe is an autobiographical role , has managed to hang onto his @entity71 - phase well into his forties			0
drinking , partying , and resisting monogamy , @entity50 still manages to attract more ladies than hotter men half his age			1
of course the only women drawn to @entity50 are either damaged girls with daddy issues or the type of dame who does n't feel complete unless she has some mess to clean up after			1
if you see yourself dating a @entity50 type , do not walk -- run -- to your nearest mental health professional			1
@entity92 ( " @entity93 " ) : those big blue eyes and that floppy mop o ' hair ... you can forgive him for making a stinker like " @entity98 , " ca n't you ? sure , but do you really want to deal with someone who lives in a dude cocoon ? not only does he live with his brother and two best friends , he ca n't make any decisions without polling the group			0
on the upside , he 's rich ! on the downside , he 's famous , which means other women are throwing themselves at him constantly			0
@entity110 might be fun for a fling , but forget about bringing him home to mama			0
@entity114 ( " @entity115 " ) : why is it when unattractive people are quiet we just assume they 're stupid and / or boring , but verbally challenged hot people get pegged as mysterious and smoldering ? mad men 's smokin ' hot @entity114 actually is mysterious ( and smoldering ! ) , so i do n't know what point i was trying to make ( because i 'm all distracted from the photos on his @entity125 page ) ... oh , wait ! the point i 'm trying to make is that while @entity114 is indeed mysterious , he 's also a liar , a cheat and a cad			1
so if a @entity131 tries to slip you his number , just say no and send it to me			0
what ? strictly for research purposes			0
