@entity0 -- after approximately a week of poring over 145 jury questionnaires , lawyers in the trial of @entity5 's doctor are due in court wednesday to discuss removing jurors whose answers they believe should disqualify them from hearing the case			1
but legal experts say prosecutors and defense attorneys in the @entity15 trial will be doing more than simply screening jurors based on their answers to the more than 100 questions filled out on september 8 and 9			1
they 'll also be scrutinizing what prospective jurors may have said outside the courthouse and online about events surrounding the june 2009 death of pop star @entity5			1
" this is the world of social media , and it directly impacts criminal trials , " said @entity25 , the attorney who successfully defended @entity5 during his 2005 molestation trial			0
" i have no doubt that both sides will hire competent people to explore every aspect of social media to try and find out whatever they can about these jurors , and also to see if these potential jurors have communicated themselves with anyone else about this case			1
" the questionnaire asks whether potential jurors " ever posted any blogs or posted comments on any internet sites " and goes on to specifically ask whether the individual " accessed or posted " any comments about @entity15 , who is accused of administering a lethal dose of drugs to @entity5			1
" i think it is safe to say that contemporary trial practice dictates that you make an effort to find out whatever information you can about jurors , " @entity0 defense attorney @entity50 said			0
" if somebody has a @entity59 page where the settings are public , and you can see what their interests are , you can very well learn valuable information there			0
" a simple internet search can link attorneys to prospective jurors ' blogs , tweets and postings on social networking sites to see if they have commented on a specific case			1
it also may offer insight into jurors ' psyches			0
" any information you can get on a prospective juror is helpful , because you have such a short period of time in which to evaluate who the person is that is ultimately going to be making a very important decision in the case , " said @entity77 , a jury consultant with @entity78			2
@entity77 has been advising attorneys for 25 years on such high - profile murder cases as @entity89 's and @entity90 's			0
he says screening jurors today is easier because of the amount of information people share on the @entity95			2
" if they have a @entity99 account , it can give you a little bit more about how they interact with the rest of the world , not just in a courtroom setting , " he said			0
but @entity77 added that it is rare for a legal team to have time to do such vetting of prospective jurors , because jury selection is completed within hours in a vast majority of trials , not over several weeks as in the @entity115 case ( and most likely @entity15 's as well )			1
" the last thing you want to be doing in jury selection is research on your laptop computer in court , " @entity50 , the attorney , said about finding time to vet jurors			1
" that can send the message to the jurors that you are engaged in some other kind of work and you are not interested enough in the case you are trying			2
" and who knows what the reaction might be if jurors knew they were the ones being judged online -- to determine if they were fit to sit in judgment			2
opening statements for the trial , which will be televised , are scheduled for september 27			0
the trial is expected to last about a month			0
if convicted of the involuntary manslaughter charge , @entity15 could face up to four years in prison .			0
