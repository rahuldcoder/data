more than half of all teens and young adults say they have been bullied or harassed online , according to the results of a new poll on @entity6 behavior			1
in an @entity10 / @entity9 poll , 56 percent of respondents , who were between 14 and 24 years old , said they had " experienced abuse " through digital media			1
that 's up from 50 percent in a similar 2009 survey			0
some of the most common forms of harassment include posting something online that 's not true , writing things online that are " mean " and sharing texts or other messages that were meant to stay private , according to the results			1
and while the ability to stay anonymous online is often cited as a reason why digital bullying can get so bad , survey respondents said that , more often than not , that 's not the case			2
" most say the perpetrators of the bad behavior are people they know very well , " the survey reads			2
one out of three resopndents also said they 've taken part in so - called " sexting , " which includes sending and receiving nude photos or video or sexually charged text			0
seventy - one percent of them said that " sexting " is a problem for web users their age			0
ten percent of respondents who said they 'd exchanged sexual messages said they 'd done so with people they only know online -- a steep drop from the 29 percent who said they 'd done so in 2009			1
if there 's a bright spot , it 's that more respondents this year said they recognize online bullying as a problem than did two years ago and more said they 'd intervene if they saw it happening			1
fifty - six percent said they would likely intervene if they saw someone being harassed online , compared with 47 percent in 2009			0
the survey is part of @entity9 's " a @entity65 , " campaign , a multiyear effort to stamp out digital abuse			2
" the campaign is built on the understanding that there 's a ' thin line ' between what may begin as a harmless joke and something that could end up having a serious impact on you or someone else , " @entity9 writes on the campaign 's website			0
" we know no generation has ever had to deal with this , so we want to partner with you to help figure it out			0
" the survey results were based on interviews of 1,355 teens and young adults conducted between august 18 - 31			1
it has a margin of error of 3.8 percent .			0
