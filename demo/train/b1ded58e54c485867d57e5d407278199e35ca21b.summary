-- @entity1 was a typical farmer 's son who migrated to the city seeking a better life			2
he seemed to have found it in @entity6 , a booming city in southern @entity7 , where he worked at @entity9 , a company better known for producing components for @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and other companies			1
but the 21 - year - old worker was found dead on may 14 after falling from the seventh floor of a factory dormitory , according to local police			1
@entity1 's death was the ninth in a spate of similar incidents in which @entity9 employees have fallen to their deaths from buildings			1
@entity6 police are treating the cases as suicides			1
@entity29 , a spokesman for the @entity30 - owned @entity9 , said : " according to the police , most of the nine employees were suffering from personal problems related to emotions or health			1
" a few days after @entity1 's death , another @entity9 employee died after falling from a building at the @entity6 factory complex			1
in all , state - run media reports there have been 10 deaths and two failed suicide attempts over the past five months			1
these incidents , widely reported by the @entity46 media , have raised questions about the plight of migrant workers and the pressures they endure living and working in big cities			1
@entity9 is one of the world 's top electronics manufacturers			1
of its 800,000 employees in @entity7 's mainland , 420,000 are in @entity6 , where they work in shifts and live in the sprawling factory complex			2
right now , there are no concrete answers as to what drove the workers to commit suicide			1
@entity9 insists that its workers are treated well and there could be a number of factors at play			1
@entity29 said the company is analyzing the mindset of their employees to try and get to the root of the problem			1
" it 's true our employees basically stay at the same place 24 hours a day , seven days a week , " he said			2
" we also find some young employees do n't know their roommates ' names and do n't communicate with each other			2
some prefer recreational activities using mobile phones or computers instead of taking part in traditional pastimes			2
many of our workers come from rural areas and to adjust to life in the city becomes another challenge to them			1
" @entity7 has witnessed dramatic changes since the late statesman @entity96 launched his reform and open - door program in 1978			1
over the past 30 years , in a population shift that resembles the 19th century @entity101 in @entity102 , millions of farmers have moved away from the land into the cities			2
some have found jobs in small towns , working in local industries that range from coal mining to poultry raising			2
others have surged into cities such as @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity6 , where they take jobs in factories , shops and restaurants			2
as of last year , an estimated 150 million farmers have moved from farming to non-farming jobs , joining what is called " liudong renkou , " or floating population of rural migrants			1
this in - migration has helped lift more than 300 million @entity46 out of abject poverty			1
it has also brought prosperity in the cities , where a robust middle class and a legion of millionaires have emerged			2
but as with any radical change , @entity7 's reform has its losers as well as winners			0
the massive economic advance has produced unintended consequences , including growing income gaps and social malaise			0
" we have a lot of very poor people and very few rich people , " said @entity142 , a psychotherapist in @entity113			0
" there is a lot of resentment			0
" many migrants , far from home and family , can also feel alienated and often do n't have ready access to counseling , experts said			1
@entity9 said it is taking measures to improve its workers ' lives , organizing recreational activities , calling in @entity161 monks to offer spiritual consolation and setting up a 24 - hour help line			1
@entity29 said the line 's logs show it has helped prevent more than 30 suicides in the past month			1
" most cases involved emotional affairs , personal reasons or poverty of the family , " @entity29 said			1
" some got depressed because their supervisors scolded them			0
" @entity29 said the company was overwhelmed because counselors were scarce			1
" @entity9 has never seen anything like this in the past 20 years of operating in the mainland , " he said			1
@entity142 , who also teaches psychology in a privately run college in @entity113 , attributes some of the behavior to societal changes in @entity7			0
" when western countries turned to the market economy , they still had a strong sense of religion and a strong belief system			0
over the centuries , this was stamped out			0
chairman @entity191 dumped @entity192 during the @entity193			0
after @entity191 died , people dumped his ideas			0
so the ideology is all messed up ; there is no belief system out there			0
" @entity142 said that some people follow a new mantra			0
" it 's ' rou ruo qiang shi ' -- the weak are bound to be eaten by the strong , " she said			0
" that 's worse than ' @entity206 '			0
" @entity142 and social workers say that in some extreme cases , people can lash out and hurt themselves or others around them			1
they worry about the recent spate of bloody attacks on school children			0
in rural @entity214 on may 11 , a 48 - year - old man wielding a kitchen cleaver charged into a kindergarten and hacked to death seven children and two women			2
the incident followed several multiple killings in recent weeks -- five of them occurring at schools , taking the lives of 17 people , including 15 children			0
in the first official reaction to the spate of school attacks , premier @entity229 told @entity234 's @entity233 : " aside from taking strong security measures , we must also strive to solve the underlying causes that led to these problems			0
we are making serious efforts in tackling social tensions , settling disputes and improving the government 's ability to smooth things out			0
" sociologists and psychologists are searching for answers			2
some blame poor mental health care in @entity7			0
according to a report from the @entity251 , @entity7 had 173 million adults suffering from mental illness in 2005 , with some 91 percent of them -- about 158 million -- never receiving professional help			0
" there are too few qualified professionals , even in big hospitals , and there is no community - based mental health counseling , " @entity142 said			2
" people who are mentally ill do not realize they are ill ; their friends and relatives do n't know , so when they act up , everybody is surprised			0
" as with the @entity9 employee deaths , @entity142 said the attacks against students could indicate that people with problems may feel they have nowhere to turn for help			1
may @entity271 , assistant professor of psychiatry at the @entity273 , agreed that finding an outlet for concerns can be difficult			0
" in @entity7 , it 's highly controlled and people might have difficulty expressing their views , " @entity271 said			0
" demonstrations are not encouraged so people find it difficult to find channels to lodge their complaints and air their views and grievances , "			0
