-- @entity1 was a simple seamstress in @entity3 , well - loved by all her neighbors and friends			1
now , in a tragic turn of events , she has become a symbol of the cruelty gripping that conflict - wracked nation			1
@entity1 was only 18 when she stepped away from her @entity12 residence last month to buy groceries			1
her family never again saw her alive			2
she was whisked away by @entity3 security forces to coax the surrender of her activist brother , and ended up beheaded and dismembered , a neighbor , activists and human rights groups say			1
@entity21 , a neighbor and family friend , told @entity0 on monday that @entity1 's father died when she was just a toddler , leaving her mother and three siblings to fend for themselves in a country with often - unfavorable conditions for a single mother			1
all four children dropped out of school at a young age so they could work as laborers to provide for their family , @entity21 said			2
@entity1 dreamed of owning her own tailor shop , so she could support her impoverished family , he said			1
but she never had a chance to fulfill that dream			2
her older brother , @entity38 , became a well - known activist in the family 's hometown of @entity12 in western @entity3 , often leading the demonstrations against embattled @entity3 president @entity43 and treating the wounded			1
" protesters would carry @entity38 on their shoulders so he could lead the chants , " fares said			2
" he was very loved by everyone			0
the protesters even had a chant they would say for him , using his nickname : ' @entity52 , may @entity53 protect you ! ' " security forces pursued @entity56 for months , raiding his family 's home several times , causing the family to flee to a nearby neighborhood on july 25 , @entity21 said			0
on july 27 , @entity1 disappeared , leaving her family devastated and her siblings panicked and anxious , the neighbor said			1
" if it had been her brother it would have been different			0
taking @entity1 , it became a matter of family honor and family pride			1
her mother was beyond depressed			0
she seemed to be between life and death , " fares said			2
neighbors and family friends called on each other to collect donations to ease the family 's financial troubles , but this became the least of the @entity1 family 's concerns			1
several days after @entity1 disappeared , security forces called the family and offered to meet them in a @entity88 neighborhood where they would trade @entity1 for her activist brother			1
" the family did not trust the security forces			0
they would not even confirm to them that @entity1 was alive , and they all believed it was a trap to take @entity38 , too , " fares said			1
on september 10 , the family says , @entity38 was wounded in a demonstration			0
he came back to his loved ones a corpse			0
the family believes he was tortured to death			2
in a statement posted to @entity104 , another brother , @entity105 , describes multiple gunshot wounds to @entity38 's chest and a single shot through his mouth			0
" his arms were broken and there were cigarette burns to his face , " he adds			0
the family went to collect @entity38 's body from a hospital when doctors told them another unclaimed body with the label " @entity1 " had been kept in the morgue 's freezer for some time			1
when the family received the body , her head and arms had been chopped off			0
chunks of her flesh were charred , appearing in places to have been melted or burned down to the bone			0
authorities forced @entity1 's mother to sign a document saying both her daughter and her son had been kidnapped and killed by an armed gang , @entity131 said in an online statement " if it is confirmed that @entity1 was in custody when she died , this would be one of the most disturbing cases of a death in detention we have seen so far , " said @entity139 , @entity131 's deputy director for the @entity140 and @entity141			1
the case also drew the antipathy of the @entity152 @entity151 , which characterized the incident as " appalling " and an example of the " targeting and attacking of families and sympathizers of the protesters by security forces			0
" the ferocious @entity3 government crackdown against dissenters began in mid-march when anti-government protests unfolded			2
the number of people killed over the past six months has reached at least 2,700 , according to the @entity152 human rights office			0
some activist groups put the toll at around 3,000			0
@entity3 authorities could not be reached for comment on the @entity1 case			1
the @entity3 government has maintained armed gangs with foreign agendas , not the regime , are responsible for the violence that has plagued the @entity176 country for months			2
@entity0 can not independently verify the authenticity of the video , the claims , or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside @entity3			1
" perhaps more than any other family they were chosen to be at the front lines of the @entity3 revolution , " fares said of the @entity1 family			1
" they were very poor , so they felt the brunt of the injustice more than any other family			0
for @entity38 at least , he felt he had nothing to lose			0
" the neighborhood where the family lived , @entity196 , held a rally for @entity1 on sunday , and people vowed the brutality that destroyed the @entity1 family could only strengthen their resolve			2
" the case of @entity1 is not just for our town , or province , or even for the country of @entity3			1
it is a human rights issue that should bring the attention of the world , " fares said			0
but despite @entity205 ' insistence that " after @entity1 our chants are louder , our numbers greater , " he admitted the people of @entity196 constantly worry about their female family members			2
" even stepping outside the home is a risk for women now , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity219 contributed to this report .			0
