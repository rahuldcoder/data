the attorney also asked the judge to sign subpoenas so that @entity58 can file a motion to suppress alleged statements that @entity13 made , according to the letter			2
" it is our understanding that law enforcement obtained statements from mr. @entity13 ... [ that ] we expect the government will seek to use in mr. @entity13 's prosecution , and which we intend to ask this court to suppress in a pretrial motion			2
" he added , " it is our expectation that the records and materials we seek by these proposed subpoenas will establish both the efforts taken by law enforcement to move mr. @entity13 and secret him from his attorneys and to obtain an unlawful purported waiver of his right to the assistance of his attorney , " the letter said			2
in addition to speaking to agents from the @entity104 in the hospital january 7 , @entity13 was interviewed later that day at the @entity7 offices in @entity0 , the federal prosecutors said in their letter			1

after his indictment by a jury in the @entity134 , federal prosecutors gave @entity13 another speedy arraignment waiver , one that included an additional sentence , the letter said			0
" responding to a specific request from mr. @entity58 ... the government added the following language to the form ... ' i have been advised that attorney @entity58 has requested to speak with me , ' " the letter said			0
as agents were explaining the form to @entity13 and telling him that he had been indicted , " the defendant expressed concerns about being charged with conspiracy to kill @entity3 nationals abroad , " the letter said			1
" the defendant stated , in sum and substance , ' maybe i should talk to mr. @entity58 , ' and indicated this on the form , " the letter said			0
