-- @entity1 was rounding the fourth turn in the last lap at @entity4 , foot to the floor and focusing on passing a car when he caught something out of the corner of his eye			1
what was little more than a blurred glimpse for @entity1 was the center of attention for the thousands in the stands and millions more on television sunday -- @entity19 leader @entity18 's car grinding against the track 's big gray outside wall as he came around the bend , moments from victory			1
" as i cleared that car that i was overtaking i noticed that , just in the corner of my eye that he 'd got up in the gray and made contact with the outside retaining wall , " @entity1 told @entity0 's " @entity31 " on monday			2
" and at that point i just focused on making sure that i did n't get caught up in any of the debris , made sure that he did n't come back across the track in front of me			0
" and then ? then , @entity1 said , he drove " across the line like i stole it			1
" the sprint gave the @entity41 driver his second @entity19 victory -- the first came in 2005 -- and a spectacular finish for a race that was once considered among the world 's premier sports spectacles , but which has seen its television ratings fall in recent years			1
the ratings for sunday 's race , its 100th running , were not yet available			2
but viewership for the 2010 edition was the lowest since the event was first aired live in 1986 , according to the @entity55			0
about 4 million people watched last year , according to the newspaper			0
in a posting on the race 's official blog , @entity18 said that he sensed his competition was catching up as he neared the final turn and did not want to risk slowing down to avoid a car coming out of the pits			1
so he opted to move outside , towards the retaining wall			0
the move obviously did n't pay off for @entity18 , who was driving in his first indy 500 race			2
the car slipped on what 's known in racing circles as marbles -- pieces of soft rubber shed from tires during the race , @entity18 said			1
" it 's a helpless feeling driving the race car when you get in a situation like that			2
it can happen on road courses , it can happen at other places			0
it 's most extreme at a place like this where it truly does turn into a one - groove track towards the end of the - race , " the posting quoted @entity18 as saying			1
" that was certainly my mistake to have judged it otherwise			0
" while the finish was a spectacle to remember for race fans , @entity1 said it just goes to show what @entity19 drivers have long known -- that letting up during a race simply is n't an option			1
" with this race , you just never know what can happen , so it 's just about staying focused , " he said			0
" and you really do n't ever let off the power unless you have to			0

@entity19 winner @entity1 : i " drove it like i stole it "
race rookie @entity18 's crash in the final turn gave @entity1 the win
the crash left @entity18 feeling " helpless "
