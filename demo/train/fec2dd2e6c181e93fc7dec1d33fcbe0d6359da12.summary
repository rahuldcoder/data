-- 12 years a slave may have the most nominations , but @entity3 will probably benefit the most from its @entity5 recognition — which give a much needed boost to low - budget movies competing for @entity9 attention			1
the epic slavery drama collected a leading seven nominations , while @entity3 was right behind it with six			1
both films are in the running for @entity13 , alongside @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16			2
@entity17 , this year 's grand jury winner at the @entity18 , was honored in a separate category for " first feature , " which also included @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity24			0
the @entity5 , distributed by the non-profit arts organization @entity25 , are only a sporadic indicator for the @entity27 , but can help cast a spotlight on scrappier , more intimate films that do n't always have huge marketing budgets			1
@entity31 for the intense and harrowing 12 years a slave has already secured it a solid place in the running for this year 's @entity9 , and spirit nominations were expected for director @entity37 , screenwriter @entity38 , cinematographer @entity39 , lead actor @entity40 , and supporting actors @entity41 and @entity43			2
it would only have been a shock if one of them had been snubbed			0
but @entity3 — director @entity49 's black - and - white dramedy about a terse @entity51 family — is only a possible @entity9 contender for @entity9 , and these six nominations will reinforce its bona fides and perhaps add some box office momentum just as the movie is gradually expanding beyond a handful of theaters			2
the film had nods for director , first screenplay for @entity63 , lead actor @entity64 , and supporting actors @entity65 and @entity67			0
the one surprise omission was the lack of a cinematography mention for @entity72 's silvery images of the desolate rural landscapes			0
a few films that could have fared better : @entity16 , another movie on the @entity9 bubble , which really could have used a director or screenplay bid for @entity79 and @entity80 ; @entity81 , which was only recognized for its two actors ( lead actor @entity83 and supporting actor @entity84 ) , and before midnight , which got only female lead for @entity87 and best screenplay			0
other curiosities among the nominees included a posthumous honor for @entity93 's supporting performance as a middle - aged lonelyheart in @entity95 , a best director bid for @entity97 's @entity96 , even though the poetic science fiction drama was named in only one other category ( best editing ) , and a best first screenplay mention for @entity103 writer - director - star @entity102			1
