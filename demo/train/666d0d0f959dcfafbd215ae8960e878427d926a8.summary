-- the massive protests in @entity2 took an ugly turn on friday when students pressing for representative democracy clashed with opponents , prompting a breakdown of talks aimed at defusing the crisis			1
this negativity followed a week of remarkably peaceful civil disobedience in what has been dubbed the " @entity14 , " after the widely shared image of a man defiantly holding up an umbrella in a haze of police tear gas fired to disperse the tens of thousands of activists crowding the city 's main government and business thoroughfare , the region referred to as @entity24			0
but protesters shrugged off the gas assault as if it had never happened			1
behind the barricades , they studied for exams , coordinated the cleanup and recycling of trash generated by the crowd , and jerry - rigged guerrilla charging stations for the voluminous array of devices the demonstrators are using as part of the sophisticated war they 're waging on the virtual front , wielding the digital - age weapons of image feeds , live streaming video and ceaseless social media updates			1
the @entity14 is hardly the first protest to harness the power of technology to coordinate activities and broadcast messages , but it 's almost certainly the most sophisticated			1
@entity50 , a journalism professor at @entity51 , discussed the infrastructure the activists have adopted in an article for @entity55 , a system that incorporates fast wireless broadband , multimedia smartphones , aerial drones and mobile video projectors , cobbled together by pro-democracy geektivists like the ad - hoc hacker coalition @entity63			0
given this remarkable show of force by the crowd under the @entity14 , it 's not surprising that @entity68 has moved quickly to prevent transmissions from reaching the mainland , blocking @entity72 access to @entity73 , where images and videos from the demonstrations and police crackdowns are regularly being posted , and banning all posts on popular messaging sites like @entity80 and @entity81 carrying keywords that refer to the protests			1
activists have fought back by downloading the peer - to - peer " mesh messaging " app @entity85 — which allows communication among nearby users even when centralized mobile services are unavailable by linking smartphones directly to one another via @entity92 and wifi — in the hundreds of thousands , and by creating an elaborate system of numerical hashtags to stand in for forbidden terms			2
for example , # 689 is the codename for @entity2 chief executive @entity100 , referring to the number of votes he received in his selection as the region 's highest government representative , a scant majority of the 1,200 members of the the @entity110 - approved nominating committee			1
# 8964 references @entity68 's brutal june 4 , 1989 , crackdown on student democracy activists in @entity113 , which casts a looming shadow over the @entity116 demonstrations			2
these strategies seem to have prompted the @entity72 authorities to resort to new and more insidious tactics			1
links — seemingly posted by @entity63 — have begun popping up on social media , inviting users to download a new app that allows for secure coordination of protest activities			0
instead , clicking the link downloads a trojan horse that gives its developers — presumed by some security experts to be " red hat ' hackers working with support from the @entity72 government — open access to the messages , calls , contacts , location and even the bank information and passwords of those naive enough to download it			1
that 's a harsh lesson not just for those living under authoritarian regimes , but for us citizens of nominally free and democratic societies as well			0
the smartphone is by far the most formidable tool for populist empowerment ever invented , turning individual human beings into mobile broadcast platforms and decentralized mobs into self - organizing bodies			1
but it 's also jarringly easy for these devices to be used against us			0
here in the @entity163 , revelations of the existence of massive government surveillance programs like the @entity162 's @entity161 have caused an uproar among digital libertarians			2
likewise , criminal smartphone hacking and cloud cracking has led to the release of celebrity nude photos and sex videos , to the humiliation of those who thought them private			2
the response from leading smartphone developers like @entity176 and @entity177 has been to announce new methods of locking and encrypting information to make it harder for individuals , businesses or governments to gain access to our personal information			2
but even as they add these fresh layers of security , they continue to extend the reach of these devices into our lives , with services that integrate frictionless financial transactions and home systems management into our smartphones , and wearable accessories that capture and transmit our very heartbeats			0
imagine how much control commercial exploiters , criminals — or overreaching law enforcement — might have if it gained access to all these features			0
the upshot is that we increasingly have to take matters into our own hands ( and handsets ) , policing our online behavior and resisting the temptation to click on risky links			0
it may be worth exploring innovative new tools that offer unblockable or truly secure alternatives to traditional communications , like the free @entity220 browser extension @entity221 , which evades global digital boundaries to web access ; open - source projects like @entity225 and commotion , which are attempting to develop standards for mesh connectivity that route around the need for commercial mobile phone networks ; and apps like @entity233 , which offer free , worldwide end - to - end encrypted voice conversations			0
most of these are works in progress			0
but as technology becomes ever more deeply embedded into our lifestyles , keeping our digital identities secure and private is becoming increasingly critical			0
and as the protests in @entity2 have shown , the only solution may be to use technology to defend against technology — in other words , to fight fire with @entity85 .			1

students in the massive protests in @entity2 want representative democracy
@entity254 : these protesters may be the most sophisticated and technologically savvy ever
he says @entity72 authorities are blocking images and creating apps that trick protesters
@entity254 : smartphone a great tool for populist empowerment but it can easily be used against us
