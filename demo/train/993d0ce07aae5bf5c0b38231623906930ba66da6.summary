@entity0 -- @entity3 ' claim that a microchip implanted in her brain made her tweet bad things about her father could be key evidence in keeping the actress in a mental facility , according to experts			1
@entity3 , 28 , was admitted to a @entity13 , @entity14 , facility on an involuntary emergency psychiatric hold friday , but a probable cause hearing must be held this week if her doctors want to keep her there			1
her admission to @entity20 came hours after @entity3 posted a series of tweets alleging her father verbally , physically and sexually abused her			1
however , she disavowed responsibility for the accusations in a tweet a short time later : " my dad never did any of those things the microchip in my brain made me say those things but he 's the one that ordered them to microchip me			2
" @entity3 then boarded a flight from @entity33 to @entity0 , where she told reporters at the airport that she was there to file a lawsuit against her parents			2
while she was told that a limo driver was taking her to a lawyer 's office in @entity13 before going to a @entity41 , she was instead driven to the hospital -- which resembles an office park -- where her parents ' lawyer was waiting for her			0
" in a perfect world , one would be honest about getting a person into a psychiatric hospital , but from her past behavior we have seen that @entity3 avoids psychiatric hospitals at all cost because she does n't believe that she 's sick , " dr. @entity46 , a @entity0 psychiatrist who has followed @entity3 ' story , told @entity1 on sunday			1
if the psychiatrists at @entity20 decide to extend @entity3 ' involuntary treatment beyond the initial 72 hours allowed for evaluation under @entity14 's " 5150 " law , they must convince a mental health referee that she is " a danger to self , to others or is gravely disabled , " @entity46 said			1
there does not have to be any expressed desire to kill herself , but the doctors need to show evidence that her behavior was so dangerous that it " presented a risk to herself , if not others , " @entity46 said			0
one reason for keeping psychiatric patients on an involuntary hold is if they are " having auditory hallucinations " or they are " responding to internal stimuli , " according to guidelines on the @entity83 website			1
unless @entity3 volunteers to stay in treatment , the doctors must make their case , according to attorney @entity86			1
" they ca n't just make up evidence			0
it has to be true and observable			0
the hearing is not just a rubber stamp			0
" the ups and downs of @entity3 her tweet about a microchip forcing her to write negative things about her father would not be the only potential evidence , based on her very public history of odd behavior and several criminal charges			1
@entity3 was arrested on a @entity102 charge in @entity103 , @entity14 , last month			1
her arrest report noted a " disheveled appearance			0
" her last several days in @entity33 included an incident at a clothing store in which security officers accused her of shoplifting			0
she was let go after signing a " no - trespass agreement , " @entity110 reported			0
@entity3 was charged with a hit - and - run in 2012 , hospitalized for treatment last year after a psychological evaluation and put on probation after a dui earlier this year			2
and she was arrested after allegedly tossing drug paraphernalia out of the window of her @entity33 apartment in may 2013			0
this is the second time @entity3 has been placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold			1
the previous instance came in july 2013 after she was " involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood " in @entity124 , @entity14			2
she eventually entered an inpatient psychiatric facility and was later released into her parents ' custody			0
in september : @entity3 arrested on @entity102 charge the latest episodes of odd behavior come a year after her parents told @entity1 their daughter was " making great strides towards recovery " from mental illness			1
she enrolled into the @entity136 in @entity0 at the start of 2014 , but she dropped out in the summer			0
@entity3 ' parents will not be allowed to attend the administrative hearing , which would be held at the hospital , unless their daughter invites them , according to court guidelines			1
they have not publicly indicated if they will ask a judge to give them legal control of their daughter under a conservatorship			0
@entity46 said if @entity3 is returned to a conservatorship under her parents , as was done last year , they need to work with a psychiatrist to " work out the family dysfunction			2
" people magazine reported in 2012 that @entity3 tried to emancipate herself while still a minor , though she never moved out entirely			2
@entity1 's @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
