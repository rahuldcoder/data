former vice president @entity0 led a parade of @entity3 administration officials who denounced a report on harsh interrogation techniques used against terrorism suspects , saying he would " do it again in a minute			1
" defenders of the @entity10 's use of interrogation techniques used the weekend 's news programs to make a passionate case , following the release of a scathing report , composed by @entity16 , condemning the @entity3 - era practices			1
in an interview on @entity20 's " @entity19 , " @entity0 said the methods described in the @entity23 's report -- including mock executions , rectal feeding and sleep deprivation -- do n't amount to torture			1
torture , @entity0 said , " is an @entity29 citizen on a cell phone making a last call to his four young daughters shortly before he burns to death in the upper levels of the @entity35 in @entity36 on 9/11			1
" " there 's this notion that somehow there 's moral equivalence between what the terrorists do and what we do			2
and that 's absolutely not true , " he said			0
" we were very careful to stop short of torture			0
the @entity16 has seen fit to label their report torture			2
but we worked hard to stay short of that definition			0
" the @entity51 added that he had no regrets about the techniques used by the @entity3 administration			1
he called the @entity16 panel 's report " seriously flawed " and said the committee should have talked to officials involved in the interrogation program			1
" i would do it again in a minute , " he said			2
@entity62 , @entity3 's attorney general , said the @entity16 panel 's investigators cherry - picked the evidence they included in the report			1
the report , he said in an interview with @entity68 on @entity69 , is " jam - packed with untruths " and will " demoralize the @entity10			2
" " it 's even worse than that , " he said			0
" they were cherry - picking , throwing away the cherries and they printed the pits			0
" one of the report 's bombshell assertions was that the @entity10 kept details of its tactics from @entity3			1
the president 's former top political adviser , @entity82 , said that 's untrue in an interview with " @entity86			0
" @entity82 said @entity3 was briefed on the @entity10 's tactics and authorized some of the specific ones that were used			1
" he made the decision			0
he was presented , i believe , 12 techniques			0
he authorized the use of 10 of them , including waterboarding , " @entity82 said			0
all @entity51 were n't as defensive of the @entity3 administration 's tactics			1
@entity100 sen. @entity99 argued the tactics outlined in the report do amount to torture , and said he would " urge everyone to just read the report			1
" " these are the communications within the @entity10 as to what happened , " he said on @entity107 's " @entity106			0
" " you ca n't claim that tying someone to the floor and have them freeze to death is not torture			0
you ca n't say 183 times someone is waterboarded			0
" @entity99 said calling the tactics used under @entity119 " -- an acronym for enhanced interrogation techniques -- is " orwellian			2

several @entity3 administration officials defended the tactics used to interrogate terrorism suspects
their defense came after the @entity23 released a report on the issue
@entity0 *sharply* *criticized* the report and said he *'d* use the same tactics again " in a minute "
