it might seem like there 's a @entity2 on every corner , but the company 's executives still want to get those tall , grande and venti pumpkin spice lattes into more hands , more easily			1
amid news that the @entity12 - based company 's fourth - quarter sales had been " disappointing , " @entity2 ceo @entity8 revealed on thursday that the coffee chain will roll out a delivery option in the latter half of 2015 to loyalty - program members in select markets			1
" imagine the ability to create a standing order of @entity2 delivered hot to your desk daily , " @entity18 said on the earnings call			1
" that 's our version of e-commerce on steroids			0
" next month , @entity2 customers in @entity29 , @entity30 , will have access to a mobile ordering app that lets them order and pay for their beverages ahead of time and skip the line for pickup			1
although @entity18 did not provide the nitty - gritty on how the company plans to implement the delivery program ( @entity42 , @entity2 ' global chief strategy officer , said on the call that the program is in its " early days " ) , here are some thoughts on how it could -- and could not -- flip consumers ' lids : how it could deliver : 1			1
you 're a creature of habit			0
you want the same coffee at the same time every day ? no problem			0
no more waiting in lines behind indecisive customers debating whip or no whip , or having to carve out time in your busy day for a coffee run			2
you get to skip the annoyances of coffee shop culture , from the person listening to music out loud to the obnoxious cell phone talker to the chair hogger			2
you can place a big order for you and your buddies without worrying about having enough hands to get it back safely			2
how it could fail to deliver : 1			0
you lose the coffee shop culture : the free @entity74 , the cute barista , the quirky name spelling on the cup			0
oh , and the free ( usually ) clean bathrooms			0
with an added service often comes an added cost , not to mention a gratuity			0
better beef up that coffee fund			0
many of @entity2 ' drinks are temperature - sensitive			1
with time for delivery , an iced drink could arrive watered down , and a hot one could arrive lukewarm			1
but if the wrong drink arrives , it 's not just a matter of pushing it back across the counter ; it 's a matter of calling out for another delivery			1
what do you think of the plans @entity2 has brewing ?			2

@entity2 *announces* it will offer a delivery option via its mobile app in 2015
next month , @entity29 customers will be able to order their drink ahead and skip the line
the delivery option will be available to loyalty - program members in select markets
