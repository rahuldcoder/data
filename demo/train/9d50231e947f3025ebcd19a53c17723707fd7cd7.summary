-- after hours of chewing over how to deal with @entity4 's annexation of @entity5 , @entity2 heads have added a further 12 individuals to their blacklist			1
the list -- adding to an initial 21 person - one long penned on monday -- is to be released on day two of their @entity10 summit			0
its first incarnation , presented to @entity16 leaders for discussion on thursday night , included figures close to the @entity19 , an @entity2 union official said			2
notable on the list are @entity20 , speaker of @entity4 's upper house , as well as the country 's deputy prime minister , @entity23 , @entity0 has learned			1
the inclusion of @entity23 , in particular , the official said , was almost blocked by @entity27 and @entity28			0
they were fearful of the fallout from naming one of @entity4 's top politicians			1
yet there was a sense that , as an outspoken critic of the @entity37 , @entity23 -- like others targeted -- deserved reprimand , the source said			0
@entity40 also expressed concern about an unnamed candidate for sanctions , but withdrew its objection			0
@entity0 also understands that family members -- thought to be key to the efficacy of any measures -- were not considered amid questions about the legality of such a move and the viability of placing travel bans on individuals , who in some instances are already residents inside the @entity2			2
those expecting swathes of @entity4 industry to feel the brunt of @entity16 's indignation may be disappointed			2
for sources say that no chief executives of the country 's largest companies , like @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , will feature on the additional file			0
@entity4 president @entity67 's chief of staff @entity68 and his minister of defense @entity70 were not written into the documentation , prepared for @entity16 's leaders ahead of their meetings , for fear of sending a bellicose signal to @entity4			1
though , because of their stature , there was debate about placing them back on , the aide said			0
advisers to the @entity4 president , @entity84 and @entity85 , both of whom also face @entity89 sanctions , were set to be targeted by the @entity2 as well			1
some subject to @entity2 sanctions also find themselves on two lists released by the @entity89 this week			0
@entity16 has had difficulty in matching @entity89 's action against @entity4 on @entity96 because each move requires ratification by all 28 member states .			1
