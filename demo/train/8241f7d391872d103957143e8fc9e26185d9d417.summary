last week , @entity1 press secretary rear adm. @entity35 told reporters there was " no expectation " that @entity3 troops would be " physically , geographically in a situation where that they should be exposed " to @entity6 , though he admitted that risk to lab technicians is higher than the troops			1

three @entity3 civilians who have so far contracted the disease while in @entity66 were similarly evacuated			1

they will also have to fill out questionnaires on their physical condition and any symptoms they might be experiencing			0
up to 4,000 @entity3 military personnel have been approved for deployment in this effort , which gen. @entity12 said would cost an estimated $ 750 million over a six month period .			2
