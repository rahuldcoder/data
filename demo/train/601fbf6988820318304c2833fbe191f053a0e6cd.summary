-- it has taken almost three months and more than 100 men embarking on a life - threatening hunger strike for president @entity4 to remind himself and the nation why the prison at @entity8 needs to be closed			1
self - starvation is excruciating , but as one of our clients expressed , this is the only way the men at @entity8 have left to tell the world what it means to be unjustly detained without charge or trial for more than 11 years with no end in sight			1
the starvation protest , which began in february , has created headlines around the world			0
of the 100 men , 23 are being force fed to keep them alive			1
as you read this , it 's likely that some of the men are being dragged from their cells , strapped to restraint chairs , and a rubber tube inserted up their nose and into their stomachs to pump in liquid dietary supplement			2
one of the men described the traumatic experience to his attorney as having a razor blade go down through your nose and into your throat			0
last week , 40 additional military medical personnel were sent to @entity8 to assist with the force - feedings , a practice that the @entity45 condemned as a violation of " core ethical values of the medical profession " and the @entity49 condemned as torture and a breach of international law			1
force - feedings at @entity8 are nothing new , and much like indefinite detention , the practice has come to define the prison			1
in 2005 , when the first mass hunger strike at the prison took place , the @entity58 administration also responded by having medical personnel force - feed the men			1
back then the men were fighting for due process and access to attorneys ; eight years later and with more than half the prison population cleared for release by the @entity4 administration itself , the men are asking for an end to their indefinite detention			1
as president @entity4 said last week , the prison is " not necessary to keep @entity75 safe			1
it 's expensive , it 's inefficient , it hurts us in terms of international standing , it lessens cooperation with our allies in counterterrorism efforts			0
" it is also illegal and inhumane , as the @entity49 ' top independent human rights experts and the international human rights body with jurisdiction over the @entity75 , the @entity87 's @entity86 , reminded the president			0
i would like to believe that if the president could see what lawyers at my organization have witnessed during visits with our clients in the last few weeks , he would act without delay to make good on the promise he made to close @entity8 four years ago			1
the toll that starvation and the violence of force - feedings have taken on the men is painful to see			2
they have lost 30 to 40 pounds , they look skeletal , and many are losing consciousness and coughing up blood			0
last we heard , one of our clients weighed 90 pounds			0
i 'd like to believe that if president @entity4 knew a man like @entity117 , he would understand that closing the prison is not a matter of political expediency but life or death			2
@entity117 has been cleared for release , the government has said there are no " military rationales " for detaining him further , and other countries have expressed an interest in resettling him because he fears persecution in his home country of @entity131			0
yet he continues to languish in a cell years later			0
what does that do to a man 's spirit ? the president said he continues to believe " we 've got to close @entity8			1
" but believing is not enough			0
believing in the president and having their hopes for justice raised and dashed so many times since the order to close @entity8 was first signed in 2009 is what drove the men at @entity8 to put their lives on the line with this hunger strike			1
@entity8 is back in the news in a serious way for the first time in years , and it is the men themselves who have succeeded in putting it there , using the only peaceful means they have available to them to demand their lives back			1
the president has more staff members force - feeding men whom his own administration cleared for release than he has working to transfer them out			2
it should not take the inevitable deaths that will follow from this crisis for the president to act			0
he must stop pretending @entity168 is preventing him from doing anything			2
right now he has the authority that @entity168 provided under the @entity171 to start transferring the men who have been cleared using a national security waiver			1
he also has the power to lift his self - imposed moratorium on transfers to @entity177			0
collective punishment based on nationality is as illegal as indefinite detention			0
the president said the right things last week			0
he has said the right things before			0
all it takes now is the humanity and the will to act and end the horror that is @entity8 prison			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity192 : it took 100 men on a hunger strike for @entity4 to *remember* he must close @entity8
@entity190 : starving is the only way inmates can protest being held 11 years with no charges
@entity4 sent more staff to force feed hunger strikers , which is considered torture , he says
@entity190 : @entity4 has authority to close prison , it 's a ruse that @entity168 prevents him
