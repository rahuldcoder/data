" the 17 - time grand slam champion relinquished the year - end top spot to @entity39 when he decided not to defend his @entity41 title last week , having pushed his record tally to 302 weeks at the top			2
fifth - ranked @entity11 took advantage of a weakened field and shock defeats for @entity39 and no. 3 @entity47 by winning his first masters level tournament , following up his title in @entity50			1
however , the 30 - year - old had never beaten @entity1 in 13 previous attempts , winning just three of 30 sets played -- including defeat to @entity1 in the 2007 final of the elite event when it was held in @entity58			2

i 've qualified and i 'm obviously relieved and thrilled that that 's the case			0
" @entity11 's been on a great run and he is so respected by his fellow competitors			1

@entity11 , who also has a tour - leading seven titles in 2012 , must now beat @entity93 if he is to emulate last year 's achievement of reaching the semifinals in @entity17			1
" i had a lot of chances to break his serve , " @entity11 said of his latest @entity1 defeat			2
" when he had one break point , he made it			0
