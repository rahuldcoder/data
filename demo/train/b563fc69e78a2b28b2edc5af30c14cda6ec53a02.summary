@entity0 knows her way around a courtroom			1
she spent years as a deputy district attorney in @entity4			1
she became a household name as the lead prosecutor in the @entity8 murder trial , one of the only cases she ever lost			1
@entity10 left that life behind a long time ago , but she 's still mining her past , only now as a successful crime novelist			1
@entity10 published her first novel , " @entity15 , " last year to strong sales and positive reviews			1
it featured @entity19 , a strong - willed deputy district attorney in @entity4 , with a deep sense of justice and a bit of a rebellious streak			1
sound like anyone familiar ? now @entity19 returns in " @entity27 , " which hits book stores may 8			1
this time out @entity19 is looking for a homeless man 's killer			1
in her investigation she uncovers a connection to the brutal murder of a @entity4 police officer			1
as @entity19 gets closer to the truth , she becomes the target of a cunning psychopath			1
given her background , it 's no surprise that @entity10 's writing crackles with authenticity			1
the courtroom exchanges in her latest novel are crisp and brimming with tension			2
the lawyers , cops and bad guys feel real			0
the story is fast - paced and will keep readers interested to the end			0
while @entity10 closed the door on her career as a prosecutor , she continues to stay active with the law by working on appellate court cases			1
she 's also a frequent legal commentator and analyst for several tv networks , including @entity58 , but @entity10 says writing has become her real passion			1
she recently talked to @entity58 from her home in @entity4			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity58 : i understand you 're a longtime fan of crime fiction			1
when did you know you wanted to be a writer ? @entity10 : this has been a lifelong addiction for me			1
i loved reading those stories			0
when i was 10 or 11 i cracked her code			0
i figured out the formula that every time her dad went out of town she caught a case			0
then i graduated into crime fiction of the adult variety			1
i was so addicted that even when i was a prosecutor i was reading murder mysteries , authors like @entity83 and watching " @entity85 , " as well as doing it for real all day long			2
@entity58 : it seems like you share a lot in common with your heroine , @entity19			1
how autobiographical are your books ? @entity10 : i share traits in common with all the characters			1
i do n't know if there 's a way to avoid putting yourself into each and every character , the bad guys as well as the good ones			2
i 'd like to try because i certainly do n't want the book to be about me , but it is about a female prosecutor so there 's going to be things in common			1
i was only conscious of giving her my bad traits			0
i think of @entity19 as being so much better than me , with the exception of the places where she 's like me and then she 's not so good			1
@entity58 : how did being a prosecutor help you in becoming a writer ? @entity10 : first of all , the experience of meeting the kind of people that you meet being a criminal attorney , whether its prosecutor or defense attorney , is unmatchable			1
there 's nothing like it			2
there 's no duplicating that in any other job or career			2
you run into worlds of people you would never ordinarily meet			0
that gives you a sense of the kinds of characters that are out there			0
as a criminal lawyer , especially as a prosecutor , you have to be able to tell a story and put that story together as cogently as possible and then try to present it as cogently as possible			2
you do set up a case with the idea in mind that you 're going to be telling a story as effectively , as comprehensively , and as dramatically as you can			0
now judges can get in the way of that , every time an objection gets sustained and every time you get a bad ruling things can go awry			0
you ca n't control it all , but you try			0
@entity58 : what kind of feedback have you had from other lawyers ? @entity10 : from what i 've heard so far they agree that it feels spot on			2
what i was trying to do was capture more than the technical and procedural details , because sometimes i had to bend those rules , shorten time frames and things like that			0
if i have to start talking about the backlog at the crime lab or how long it takes to get a rape kit tested -- snore ! i need to tighten that up and make it sound like we can get our results as fast as we wish we could			2
other than that , i wanted to share the feeling of camaraderie among prosecutors and police officers , the kind of humor they share , their dialogue , the way they 're always needling each other , messing with each other , that kind of sense of sharing a world together , i wanted to convey that feeling			0
the people who have read the books who are in the business tell me it feels very real			0
@entity58 : do you miss your days in court ? @entity10 : i get as much as i want from doing appellate work			2
that 's something you can do from home			2
you review transcripts for technical errors and you write briefs , so it 's all written			2
it keeps me up to speed with how cases are being tried today , as opposed to back when i was in court			0
it keeps me up to speed with the technology they 're using in courtrooms , the kinds of crimes that are being prosecuted , the kinds of criminals that are coming through			0
so it keeps me fresh that way			0
i really do n't miss the trials and courtroom appearances			0
@entity58 : as a legal analyst , i expect you 're following the @entity232 case			0
what 's your take ? @entity10 : i would expect now what 's going to happen is this is going to go away for quite some time			1
if i 'm a defense attorney what i want is for everybody to calm down , go away and forget about the case and let tempers cool			0
because right now it 's still very hot , there 's a lot of hard feelings and emotion in the air			0
that 's the last thing the defense wants if you go to trial under these circumstances			0
so , i would expect the defense to do everything they can to delay the trial and it would n't surprise me if it took at least a year to get into court			0
@entity58 : is this a case you would have wanted to prosecute ? @entity10 : i ca n't say there 's any case i look at and say , " @entity263 , i wish i was the prosecutor			1
" i 'm really done			0
i 've really closed that door			0
@entity58 : what 's next for you ? @entity10 : i 'm sticking with the books			1
i 'm wrapping up book three right now and then jumping into book four			0
i just want to continue the @entity19 series and focus on that because i 'm really loving it			2
i just know if i had to stop writing @entity272 , i 'd miss her ! connect with @entity0 on her website .			2
