-- president @entity1 called it " the defining issue of our time " in his 2012 @entity8 , but he did so without ever uttering the phrase " income inequality			1
" perhaps that 's because income inequality is one of those alliterative word pairs everyone 's heard by now but few fully understand			1
instead of wonking up his speech with terms that may confuse some , @entity1 focused on the more familiar @entity17			1
that 's " the basic @entity20 promise , " as he put it , " that if you worked hard , you could do well enough to raise a family , own a home , send your kids to college , and put a little away for retirement			2
" the defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive , " he continued			0
" no challenge is more urgent			0
no debate is more important			0
" but what , exactly , is income inequality , and why does it matter so much in modern @entity20 that you would vote on it as one of the top social justice issues of our time ? here 's a snack - sized primer : a definition of income inequality income inequality refers to how evenly or unevenly income is distributed in a society			1
the @entity20 has a relatively high level of income inequality because the very richest people take home a large share of the economic pie -- and there is a relatively large gap between them and some of the poorest people in @entity20			1
scandinavian countries have lower levels of income inequality because , overall , prosperity is more broadly distributed there , instead of being concentrated in the hands of a few			1
there are other variations of inequality , too			0
some economists think " wealth inequality " is a better measure of what 's happening in the @entity20 , since the super-rich are even farther away from the rest of us when you consider their assets , not just their incomes			1
some prefer the broader term " economic inequality			2
" how is income inequality measured ? the most popular measure of inequality is called the @entity78			1
that coefficient , or index , " measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution , " according to the @entity89			0
a rating of 0 means the society in question is perfectly equal -- or everyone has the same income			0
a rating of 100 means that one person takes home 100 % of the income			0
the @entity20 has a @entity78 rating of 45 , according to the @entity99			2
@entity100 , the most - equal country , gets a rating of 23			0
@entity103 , in southern @entity102 , has the highest @entity78 on the @entity105 's list with a rating of 63.2			0
there are other ways to measure inequality , too , such as looking at the income held by the richest 20 % and comparing it to that held by the poorest 20 %			2
all of the different measures try to answer the question : how is money distributed in this place ? what 's the trend in the @entity20 ? the reason the president and others keep talking about income inequality -- with or without calling it that -- is because the income gap in @entity20 has been growing since the late 1970s			1
experts disagree on exactly why , but most say it has something to do with cutting taxes on the very richest @entity20 and the growth of the finance industry			2
technology also likely contributes to the shift , as many middle - class workers have seen their jobs taken by machines			0
meanwhile , the very richest people are taking home a larger share of income than at any time since the late 1920s			2
is more income inequality necessarily bad ? pretty much no one these days thinks everyone in the @entity20 should have exactly the same income			1
but many economists and philosophers say extreme income inequality -- and many would argue that 's what we have -- is a problem			1
the economist @entity151 argues income inequality is " holding back " our recovery from the recession			1
the epidemiologist @entity155 says high income inequality is associated with all sorts of bad things -- from obesity to high incarceration rates and violence			1
the philosopher @entity162 told me societies can become so economically divided that people stop seeing each other as equals -- and a sort of classist , " @entity169 " dynamic develops			0
others argue income inequality hampers economic mobility -- meaning it 's less likely that that @entity17 is actually a reality for people			1
think of the economy as a ladder , former @entity20 labor secretary @entity176 told me			2
if the rungs of the ladder are super far apart , how can you expect a person to climb ? more - conservative thinkers argue that income inequality is necessary for a capitalist society to thrive -- that income gaps encourage competition , innovation and hard work			1
how is the use more unequal than @entity191 ? if you look at the @entity105 's list of the most equal and unequal countries , the @entity20 ranks below a whole host of nations that most @entity20 probably would n't want to move to			2
they include : @entity199 , @entity198 , @entity191 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207			0
i could go on and on			0
it 's important to keep in mind that , in this case , the @entity78 coefficient is being used to measure inequalities within a given society			0
@entity102 has a very high rate of income inequality because it does have both very wealthy and very poor people			1
there are n't many rich people in @entity220 , another country that 's more equal than the @entity20			0
if everyone is more or less poor -- a country still could be relatively equal			0
so , that 's a caveat			0
but there still is research to support the idea that very high levels of income inequality tear at the fabric of society , regardless of its overall wealth			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity235 .			0

income inequality has been growing in the @entity20 since the late 1970s
@entity239 : the topic is *pervasive* but relatively little - understood
@entity1 argues against income inequality without using the term
