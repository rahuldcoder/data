-- this week the @entity2 president will visit @entity3 for the first time			1
quite why he has left it to his second term to make the trip baffles many in the @entity10 's halls of power			1
and there 's no denying it paints a decidedly underwhelming picture of today 's trans - @entity16 relationship at a time when @entity20 's aggression in the east requires it to be strong			1
born from the ashes of the second world war , @entity23 's alliance with the @entity2 has been a major force for global peace and prosperity , conquering cold wars and fighting for common values			1
yet amid allegations of @entity2 spying on its friends and @entity23 's ensuing grudge , it 's time to redefine those ties so that both parties can move on to the next stage			1
like a marriage in which the kids have long flown the nest , the @entity10 and the @entity2 have drifted apart			1
@entity23 's countries have crept closer together , pooling their commercial might into one free trade and legislative bloc , just as @entity46 has entered a new isolationist era			1
@entity51 , burgeoning emerging economies have tempted the roving eve and , though it 's not yet time to call in the divorce lawyers , a reality check is long overdue			1
so what better excuse to take stock than a comparatively new initiative called the @entity58 , or @entity59 for short , the biggest free trade pact in history and the cornerstone of a new economic age			1
let 's face it , trade in itself is not a sexy subject			2
but if politicians were to let the money do the talking for once , their electorates would sit up and listen			0
and a few years from now , the pros and cons of increased globalization will yet again make their way higher up the political agenda ; for better or worse			0
the t - tip is ambitious			2
perhaps a little too ambitious , you could argue , with the goal of creating an open market for the region 's 700 million potential consumers			0
a move which economists reckon could add about half a percent of growth to both economies by 2027			0
yet any deal will require endless negotiations , consultations with huge swathes of industry , hours clocked up in red - eye flights and much late - night quibbling over health and safety and agricultural trading directives among a myriad other issues			0
@entity98 will be sorely disappointed if @entity99 does not set a clear agenda on this topic in his address			1
@entity10 trade commissioner @entity103 told me at a gathering organized by the @entity106 that any trade deal worth having would have to be " ambitious			2
" still , as various rounds of failed @entity111 negotiations have taught us , there is no use in putting too many issues on the table or nothing will be achieved			0
to see the light of day , the pact will have to accomplish three broad things			0
first governments will have to sell the concept to their people and convince them of its economic benefits			0
research conducted by the @entity126 estimates an open trans - @entity16 area could add 214 billion euros in extra growth for both parties			1
secondly the partnership affords both sides an opportunity to tackle superfluous red tape , harmonizing existing rules and regulations , providing a new framework for drafting future legislation			0
where the @entity58 pact will really make a difference is on its third goal : investment			2
both economies currently enjoy $ 4 trillion of such money flows , supporting 7 million jobs			0
if the free trade zone were to give business leaders the confidence to see a clearer , less bureaucratic trade climate , such figures would multiply fast			0
so that 's the theory but what about the practicalities ? smashing subsidies , eliminating other non-tariff and tariff barriers to trade will be unpopular , especially with so called special interest sectors like chemicals and cars , each deploying their formidable trade lobbies at each twist and turn			0
to be effective any new rules will also have to govern new , complex and intangible commodities , like data , and balance @entity23 's hunt for new energy providers with @entity2 's desire to keep its oil surplus to itself			1
the initial stages of the free trade zone are unlikely to be passed until after the @entity2 midterm elections			2
even then , selling the concept to an increasingly protectionist congress will be tricky			0
and all the while , the @entity176 is coming up for its own vote in may , further delaying the @entity59 timeframe			0
yet the opportunity cost to the world 's most influential alliance of not formalizing its lucrative partnership at a time when other deals are being struck elsewhere would leave both sides wrong - footed			1
the trans - @entity16 relationship needs a new purpose			1
although the two may not exactly be celebrating their diamond anniversary , it 's time to renew those vows and start thinking about the putting something extra in the pension fund			2
and where better to start than with more trade			0

@entity99 to visit @entity3 , the de facto " home " of the @entity10 , for the first time this week
@entity0 's @entity206 says @entity99 should use the trip to *revitalize* relations between the @entity2 and the @entity10
trans - @entity16 links have been *damaged* by allegations the @entity2 spied on its @entity23 friends
the @entity58 may help *reinvigorate* the relationship
