@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 says she just could n't take it anymore			1
so she did what no other relative of those missing on @entity7 could do : she made the 10 minute drive from her home near @entity0 to the nerve center of the search for the missing plane at @entity14 , and asked what they were doing to try and find her husband			1
" i 've seen what they 're doing and have been taken over the process and i feel so privileged that i 'm here now , that i 'm right on and close to the search and that i can ask the questions , " @entity18 told @entity2 in an interview at her home friday			1
" and i feel so much for the families that are abroad -- in @entity27 , @entity28 , the @entity29 and everywhere else -- all families , that they ca n't be here			2
" weeks ' 39 - year - old husband , @entity31 , a mechanical engineer , was on flight 370			1
he was headed to @entity33 on a project and expected to be home to celebrate his son @entity36 's first birthday in a few weeks			1
" sometimes i catch myself , you know , seeing the excitement of him coming home and i have to get ... that out of my brain quick because i ca n't let myself go to that level of excitement ... it 's only going to make me crash further when i find out the real truth , which we 're all expecting will be the plane has crashed			1
but until that point and we have something concrete , i ca n't grieve			2
but seeing the international search effort firsthand has given weeks a measure of comfort , she said			2
still , she does have nagging doubts about the lack of evidence and the amount of guesswork that has driven the investigation so far			2
the search goes underwater " this area -- where they are now -- if it 's there , they 're going to find it , but it 's a big question that everybody 's got			1
is it the right area ? it 's a calculated guess , " she said			2
" so the hardest process for me is understanding that a commercial airline can just go black			2
that someone can just turn off all communications , all matter of tracking an airline and it can just disappear			0
and this is the mystery			0
" @entity18 says her two sons , @entity84 , 3 , and 11 - month - old @entity85 are too young yet to understand what 's happened to their father and for that , this mother says she 's grateful			1
still , there are questions from her 3 - year - old that are difficult to hear and answer			1
" we find the brightest star and he says , ' @entity97 , @entity98 , i love you			1
see you in the morning for breakfast			1
' and that breaks my heart			0
" the other day i was going to work and ( her son ) said , ' are you going off to work forever like @entity98 ? ' and i , i obviously had to reassure him that i was n't			0
so , i think that he 's getting , he 's getting it , that dad is gone and not coming back			0
weeks said she has complete confidence in the search team and believes that if searchers are looking in the right place , they will find something			1
and for that reason she says it 's crucial that the international mission keep going for as long as it takes			0
" we need something -- the families need something			0
we need answers -- not just for me , but for my children			0
i think the world wants to know because it 's such an unusual , extraordinary thing to happen			0
so we have to just fight for answers , " she said			0
what happens when the pinger 's batteries die ? @entity18 has tried to keep a sense of normalcy around her home for her boys			1
she 's continued working and takes the boys out on frequent outings to family and friends			0
she said she owes it to them and to her husband to get to the bottom of what happened			0
she is realistic , she said , and knows there 's a chance they may never find out what happened to flight 370			2
" i 've thought of that possibility , yes			0
am i willing to accept that right now ? no. i 'm not at that point			0
because if this was me on that plane , @entity151 would be fighting , going everywhere , asking every question , chasing down to find out what happened to me -- for our sons and for himself , " said @entity18			1
" so i just have to do my utmost right now , and keep going to find the truth			2
this will all encompass me , completely			0

@entity18 was on a business trip aboard @entity7
@entity18 has tried to keep a sense of normalcy around her home in @entity0 for her sons
still , there are questions from her 3 - year - old that are difficult to hear and answer
" we find the brightest star and he says , ' @entity178 daddy , i love you . see you in the morning for breakfast "
