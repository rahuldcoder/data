" we are very worriedly following the situation , " @entity94 said , according to the @entity106 news outlet			1
" this must be stopped immediately			0
" many displaced @entity70 have been living for decades in @entity74 , a nearly square - mile district inside @entity37 about five miles from the center of the city			1
formed in 1957 , the urban enclave is the largest @entity70 refugee community in @entity2 , with more than 148,500 registered refugees , the @entity111 said			1
refugees in @entity74 appear to have been well - integrated into @entity2 society , working as doctors , engineers , civil servants , laborers and street vendors			0

there are more than 486,000 @entity70 refugees living in nine official and three unofficial camps across @entity2 , the @entity111 said			2
most of the @entity70 refugees who fled to @entity2 amid the founding of @entity131 in 1948 were from the northern part of the area -- mainly @entity134 and the cities of @entity136 and @entity137 , the @entity111 said			2

@entity170 asked us not to report that news -- and we complied			0
@entity0 has complied with such requests before and likely will again			0
often in the first few days after a non-combatant goes missing -- whether it is a journalist , a member of a non-government organization , or other company employee -- @entity0 is asked , as are other news organizations , to delay reporting the story			0
the reason is so fact finding and any negotiations to free them can take place before their capture becomes a worldwide news event			0
hostage negotiators say that once the global spotlight is on the missing , the hostages ' value soars , making it much harder to negotiate their freedom			0
we thought you ought to know why we complied with the @entity170 request -- just as we would from any organization or company missing an employee in such a high risk area			0
@entity200 and @entity201 reported from @entity202			0
journalist @entity203 and @entity0 's @entity204 contributed to this report .			0

neither side can reach " a conclusive end , " @entity12 says
