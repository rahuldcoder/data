@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 were fresh from their raucous " @entity9 " panel at @entity8 when they sat down with @entity2 to answer our fan - oriented questions			1
it was their first time at @entity8 , and the crowds did not disappoint			2
one fan in the question line even dressed as @entity4 ' " @entity22 " character from the " @entity9 " video , eight arms and all ! here 's what they had to say about " @entity9 , " gaming and what happens when @entity28 makes you play " @entity30			1
" @entity2 : how psyched were all of you when the " @entity9 " video bumped @entity33 off the top of @entity35 ? @entity3 : stoked ! @entity4 : i 'm ok with , i mean , i do n't hate @entity33			1
@entity3 : i did get to tweet something like , " i finally got on top of @entity33			1
" @entity5 : i screen - grabbed the hell out of that page on @entity35			1
@entity3 : it 's just so cool			1
we do n't have a record label ; we do n't have anyone besides ourselves , @entity28 , @entity45 , @entity46 and some other folks that are pushing our show			2
it 's very grass - roots			2
@entity53 [ " @entity9 " sponsor ] is not like , " here 's a budget for marketing			1
" it does n't really happen			2
i mean , they do some internal marketing , but ultimately it 's up to us to push our own stuff			2
so , to be in the same breath as , you know , @entity65 and all these people and to watch our video climb the charts ... @entity5 : we 've done the work , and now it 's the fans who are deciding and buying			2
i mean , it happened with " @entity73 , " too			2
we got no. 1 on @entity77 @entity3 : we were 2 overall ; we could n't beat @entity78			1
@entity5 : who came out with a video the exact same day about football			2
@entity4 : nobody can beat him			1
@entity5 : and we put that thing together in like a month total , from writing it to recording it to filming it to editing it			1
it had to be quick			2
and it was in the middle of all the season four stuff we were currently doing , too			2
so it was really ambitious , but i think we 're all happy with how it turned out			2
@entity2 : fans will want to know , what did @entity99 do with the dancers once it was all over ? @entity3 : with the hour that i had them for , or the 58 minutes that i had left on the clock ? we had some improvs where i was like , " i do n't pay them not to dance , dance ! ! " i do n't know , i think @entity99 probably just kind of danced around with them , learned more about their history and background , took blood samples and , like , added them to his database			1
@entity5 : sounds like another viral hit ! @entity3 : that 's what i think @entity99 would do			1
he 's very friendly , so he would want to get to know them			2
he would just ask very invasive , personal questions			2
@entity2 : @entity3 and @entity4 , you both do a very good job portraying very specific types of gamers			1
how did you research your roles ? @entity4 : for me , i did n't really understand a lot of the stuff when i read the pilot , so i went on and played			1
@entity28 got me membership into it , into " @entity30 , " and i went on and played			1
and i came back a few weeks later and said , " oh , now i understand it			2
now i understand the phrases and the words and all that stuff , all the three - letter things that people say			2
" @entity3 : @entity140 more nub [ which in " @entity30 " circles is a way of making fun of new players			1
the two @entity144 look like crying eyes			2
] and for me , i read a lot of fantasy and grew up playing some rpg games and some @entity149 and stuff like that			0
i did n't play @entity30 specifically			1
in fact , i specifically stayed away from it because i did n't want the addiction			2
and someone had already written a funny show about it , so i could n't turn that addiction into something profitable , like @entity28 [ day ] did			2
so i did n't play @entity30 specifically , but i knew all the terms , roughly what they meant , and @entity28 filled us in with stuff we did n't know			1
but we all got subscriptions			0
the president of @entity165 [ the game company that distributes " @entity30 " ] was a fan of the show after the first couple seasons			1
we got a tour , and everybody there was awesome to us			0
they were into it and into the show			0
and we all got free subscriptions to play around and got hooked for a little while			0
i can say that i 'm not hooked on @entity30 anymore			1
it was intense for about two months , but then the real world came calling			0
i like to play games that i can beat , that have a beginning , middle and end			0
so that 's what i play these days , mostly @entity187 stuff			0
@entity2 : so none of you mentioned " ever - crack			0
" @entity3 : yeah , i stayed away from " @entity191 " too			1
we actually appeared in the " @entity191 " documentary called " @entity194			0
" we shot on set of " @entity9 " just a tiny little thing where we 're playing hard - core fans with the creators of " @entity191			1
" but i did n't actually get into that game either			0
" @entity191 " was really hot during the end of my college years , so i was like trying to get good grades			0
but if that stuff was out in high school , i would have been toast			0
@entity2 : of you three , who has the maddest keyboard skills , and who has the maddest controller skills ? @entity5 : i have zero keyboard skills			0
i do n't play any computer games			0
i only play console stuff			0
@entity4 : i have the keyboard skills , just for playing @entity30 for a year straight after i got addicted			1
@entity3 : i do n't know , i played like the old , the " @entity215 " and those games , so my keyboard skills are probably pretty raw			1
now , i like playing with my @entity187 and my @entity218			0
soon , hopefully , i 'll have no controller and be playing with that new thing @entity53 has , @entity221 , which would be rad			0
@entity4 : yeah , i 've been switching over to @entity187 and @entity222 and @entity223 @entity3 : we sound like total ... @entity5 : let 's name every system			1
@entity4 : yeah , i 've got an @entity228			1
@entity3 : see , i feel like i have to segment my life			1
my computer is for work / stalking my friends on @entity234			0
and my console is for gaming			0
@entity2 : how do you create buzz for your online series ? now that " @entity9 " and " @entity242 " have momentum behind them , is it easier now than it used to be ? @entity5 : the audience for " @entity9 " has continued to grow and grow and grow , but at first it was just a community of gamers			1
then it was people outside of gaming			0
i direct the show , and i do n't play " warcraft			0
" i 've never played " warcraft , " and i 'm a big fan of the show			0
i understand the characters and what 's going on , and i have a lot of friends who do the exact same			0
but one thing we 've been doing lately are these music videos			0
when " do you want to date my avatar " came out , all of a sudden we had a whole new crop of people who saw the video and loved it , but they did n't know that it was part of a show			0
and then now we 've got the " @entity9 " video , which did the same thing -- people just wanted to watch this fun video , but then it 's like , " oh , wait , this is part of a series			1
" lately , people have been -- even here at @entity8 -- people tell me , " oh , i just got into your show			0
" @entity3 : whether it 's through @entity281 or @entity187 , every new place we distribute we find new fans			1
@entity5 : actually , the @entity281 thing is huge , because people take it more seriously			0
you may look at it and think , " oh , this is just a web show , " but then you see , " this is a @entity281 show , " and it 's on a dvd			0
@entity3 : and it holds up			1
you watch it on your tv , and it 's shot very well , it 's lit well , and it can look like a tv show , really , or a movie			0
so keeping the production value very high is important			0
@entity4 : and we 're lucky , too			1
the next projects we do from this day forward , we can ride the coattails of " @entity9			1
" we have the fanbase , so we can do the online buzz , but we also have the fans from " @entity9 " and " @entity242 " to take advantage of , too			1
@entity2 : what 's the difference between a nerd and a geek ? @entity4 : @entity315 , that 's a good question			1
i envision this , i do n't know if this is right or not , but a nerd to me is a guy who like in high school has pimples and maybe glasses and sort of socially awkward			0
whereas a geek to me is anybody who 's doing something that 's not the general norm			0
@entity5 : like , a geek embraces it , maybe ? i 've always thought of nerd as someone who 's into nerdy stuff , pop culture stuff like comics			0
i think a geek is someone who embellishes			0
@entity3 : for me , i feel like a nerd is more knowledgeable about their geekdom			1
@entity4 : maybe even arrogant ? @entity5 : where a geek is more of a fan , maybe ? @entity3 : yeah , that 's it			1
if you 're a nerd , it 's because you know something			0
you 're a nerd about that			0
but if you 're a geek about it , that means you just love it .			0

" @entity9 " created " @entity9 " in about a month and landed at the top of the @entity35 chart
@entity4 , who plays @entity22 on " @entity9 , " is not *ashamed* of his @entity30 addiction
@entity3 says his character , @entity99 , on " @entity9 " is very friendly , just invasive
