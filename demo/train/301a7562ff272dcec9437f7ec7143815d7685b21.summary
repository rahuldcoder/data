-- what if robots ruled the world of golf ? a fanciful notion perhaps , but already many tasks formerly performed by humans are now carried out by mechanical devices			1
and the same maxim is very much in evidence in golf , where products such as balls and clubs only reach the marketplace after being tested to perfection using robotic technology			1
one developer has mooted the possibility of metal caddies and robot suits to help with coaching , in a sport where human error on the course is cruelly exposed			1
an industry leader in this field is @entity28 - based @entity27 , whose founder @entity29 saw a gap in the market when he started his company in 1990 -- and is now hoping to invent a fully robotic player			1
' @entity35 ' led the way two decades ago , cutting - edge technology centered around a robotic - armed machine nicknamed " @entity39 " ( after legendary @entity41 golfer @entity40 )			1
it relied on air pressure and pneumatics to generate club - head speed			2
the contraption was effectively a giant garage door spring , with three speeds : slow , medium and fast			0
@entity35 's drawback was that it could only swing one way , whereas no " human " swing is exactly the same			0
@entity29 and his partner @entity52 incorporated robot technology and computer control drive systems to produce a much more sophisticated testing mechanism			1
" if you can swing a golf club , we can simulate it , " @entity29 told @entity0			2
the approach has revolutionized the industry , enabling manufacturers to tailor their equipment to golfers of different abilities -- because not everyone has the athleticism to generate the 130 mph club - head speed of a @entity68 or a @entity69			1
but @entity29 is not content with that level of perfection , and decided to take his company 's innovations a stage further with a prototype robot golfer that will take to the course and hopefully battle the pros			1
" it 's more for the entertainment aspect than anything else , " admitted @entity29 , who said he was in talks with partners to develop the project			0
limited capability technology has clearly come a long way since the @entity88 introduced @entity89 to the world in 2004			2
the likeable robot figure may have been able to hand the winner 's check to @entity94 at the @entity98 company 's sponsored @entity96 tournament , but its capability was limited			1
at public demonstrations it could merely putt a ball into a large hole on a mat. @entity29 's ambitions extend a little further , inspired by the likes of the computer @entity108 taking on chess grandmasters before large televised audiences			0
" to be able to tackle something as difficult as golf takes this to another level , " he said			2
while " @entity120 " has an obvious appeal , the majority of commercial applications in golf and other areas are generally based on the principle of " robot helping man			1
" perhaps this is because , as @entity29 flags up , there is a " fascination / fear " of the @entity129 movie scenario where humans are enslaved by a ruthless robotic super race -- a similar theme also explored in the film @entity133			0
but as @entity136 - based company @entity135 has proved , robots can be put to more peaceful purposes and are very good at mowing grass			1
they have spent over five years perfecting the technology that sees its patented mower able to cut golf course greens and fairways to perfection			1
robot mower ready to roll the robot mower is programed by its users to carry out work on a designated part of the course , and will carry on with the task to completion , come rain or shine			2
@entity153 , chief operating officer and president of @entity135 , claims their product will change the face of golf course maintenance			2
" removing humans from that process has the combined benefit of a significant improvement in quality and consistency , " he told @entity0			0
@entity135 was used for one half of a course in @entity167 , with normal green - keeping staff cutting the grass on the other			0
@entity153 claimed the greens mowed by the robot " rolled about a foot faster " than the others ; in other words , they were smoother and better running			0
@entity135 will go to market in 2012 and @entity153 believes its applications will extend to other sports playing fields and public open spaces , saving large amounts in upkeep costs and freeing up staff for other duties			0
such advanced technology is expensive and remains outside the budget of the ordinary household , so robots cutting your lawn at home or employed in other tasks such as vacuum cleaning may be a little way off			2
but according to @entity196 , the director of robotics at @entity28 's @entity198 , the technologies employed in robotics and modern consumer electronics are converging			0
increased availability " the cost of some robots is decreasing and the availability of certain types of robots is increasing , " said @entity196 , whose research team is developing low - cost technologies and robotic applications			1
extending this to golf , one of these might be in the form of your own personal caddy			2
" imagine a machine that carried your bag and could also give you advice based on every shot you have taken in the last year ? " he told @entity0			0
for some this would be a nightmare scenario , but it would bring an end to those spats between player and caddy when each blames the other for a poor shot ! @entity196 can see other applications in the form of coaching aids			0
" a robotic suit , a form of ' super suit ' that guides your movements as you wear it , helping you to learn how to better swing the golf club , " he explained			0
for the time being , much of this remains in the future , but back in @entity246 is confident his robot golfer will hit the fairways soon and cause quite a stir			1
but he is struggling to come up with a catchy name for his creation like " @entity35 " and has settled on @entity252			0
so @entity29 is hoping his creation will do the talking for him .			0

robotics technology is becoming more *widespread* in the golf industry
it is *widely* used in performance testing of equipment such as balls and clubs
@entity246 - based company is developing a robot golfer
future roles could involve robots as caddies or personal coaches
