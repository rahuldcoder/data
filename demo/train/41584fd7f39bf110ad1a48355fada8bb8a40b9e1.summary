-- it 's time to get beyond the question of who 's to blame for the crisis along the @entity7 - @entity6 border , where tens of thousands of children -- three - fourths of them from @entity10 , @entity11 , or @entity12 -- are streaming into the @entity7 and overwhelming our border enforcement apparatus			1
we have to focus on workable solutions and skip half - baked ideas that make the problem worse			2
unfortunately , neither president @entity19 nor congressional @entity20 are bringing their a-game			1
you know who did bring theirs ? the human smuggling cartels			2
the @entity26 recently acknowledged that " criminal syndicates " planted fake media reports on foreign television networks telling desperate would - be migrants that @entity30 had passed an amnesty and urging people to go north immediately for their " permisos " ( permits ) to live legally in the @entity7			0
helping what is now nearly 100,000 young people cross the @entity7 - @entity6 border , at $ 8,000 per head , the bad guys earned about $ 800 million			0
it was a brilliant plan , and an evil one			0
how are our leaders responding ? the results are not impressive			0
@entity20 insist that @entity19 is to blame for the surge because of an accommodation he offered young undocumented immigrants in 2012			1
rep. @entity48 , @entity49 , is demanding that @entity19 end the program known as @entity51 , which lets young undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children avoid deportation and apply for a work permit , and which @entity48 claims -- with no evidence to back it up -- is responsible for the flood of children across the border			1
never mind that none of the children now crossing into the country is eligible for @entity51 , because anyone who enters the country after june 15 , 2007 , does not qualify for the program			2
never mind that , if @entity51 were to blame for the influx , it would have happened two years ago			1
never mind that the real reason so many of these kids have been turned over to family members in the @entity7 while awaiting a court date is n't @entity51			2
it 's because of a longstanding but unspoken policy by the @entity74 to treat unaccompanied minors differently from adults -- and a 2008 law signed by president @entity78 that prohibits @entity74 agents from sending them back across the border			1
it instead requires that they be handed over to the @entity83 until they can be placed in the custody of a relative			0
meanwhile , @entity19 is being just as thickheaded -- and hardhearted			1
he will soon ask @entity30 to provide more than $ 2 billion in new funding to bolster enforcement on the border			0
by all means , because the tens of billions that we spend on securing the homeland -- including the $ 38.2 billion that @entity19 and @entity95 secretary @entity94 requested from @entity30 in the fiscal year 2015 budget request -- have been so effective in tightening the border			1
@entity19 also wants additional powers for the executive branch so that immigration officials can speed up the removal of young unaccompanied minors without the nuisance of having to administer due process , including access to legal counsel			1
and to think that @entity19 was once a university lecturer on constitutional law			1
he needs a refresher course			0
this is how @entity19 deals with what he has called a " humanitarian crisis " ? what is humane about taking children who have already been through so much pain and suffering -- some of whom were , according to reports , sexually assaulted and threatened by street gangs in @entity118 -- and express shipping them back to those hellholes ? here are five things the president should do : -- as house speaker @entity122 suggested a few weeks ago , @entity19 should send in the @entity123 to help the @entity74 , which is overwhelmed , outnumbered , and occupied as a babysitter			1
in 2006 , @entity78 sent 6,000 @entity123 troops to the @entity7 - @entity6 border , in a supporting role , to help @entity74 agents by repairing fence line and fixing vehicles and thus allowing the agents to patrol the border			1
-- @entity19 needs to suspend the @entity74 's policy of allowing unaccompanied minors to stay in the @entity7 with relatives			1
young people need to be held by @entity7 immigration officials until they can be brought before an immigration judge to determine if they should be deported or whether they have a legitimate claim to refugee status			2
since current law says that unaccompanied minors have to be placed with relatives within 72 hours , we have to make sure that they get before a judge within that time period			2
but changes have to be made , since the current system has been compromised by smugglers who are using it to line their pockets			0
-- children in the custody of @entity7 immigration officials , some of whom are as young as 5 , must be treated compassionately			1
they have to be placed in decent , temperature - controlled holding rooms with sanitary conditions and adequate toilet facilities , and given sufficient food and prescribed medicine			0
they 're guests of this country , until an immigration judge says otherwise			0
-- asylum hearings need to be expedited for children from @entity118 to determine if they qualify for refugee status			1
the government can have hearings for groups of immigrants at one time , in order to speed things up			2
we simply can not deport any young person who faces a legitimate threat of violence back home			0
it could be a death sentence			0
-- some of these kids are going to have to be deported back to their home countries , in the most public and conspicuous manner possible , so that other people who are thinking about coming here reconsider			1
the administration has been smart in placing public service announcements in foreign media , telling people they 've been lied to and that there are no " permisos			0
" this is a battle of competing messages , and we have to win			0
this crisis was years in the making			0
cleaning it up will take time and effort			0
what are we waiting for ? let 's get started .			2

@entity205 : blame game over immigrant kids streaming in from @entity118 is *useless*
he says @entity48 blames @entity19 for influx , but he 's got it *wrong* ; @entity78 law drives policy on kids
he says @entity19 approach cold , *unconstitutional* . kids need legal help , may face peril if deported
