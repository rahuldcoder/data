search teams shifted to a different part of the @entity3 friday in their hunt for the missing @entity7 plane after " a new credible lead , " authorities said			1
an analysis of radar data led investigators to move the search to an area 1,100 kilometers ( 680 miles ) to the northeast , the @entity15 said , calling the new information " the most credible lead to where debris may be located			1
" " it indicated that the aircraft was traveling faster than previously estimated , resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft traveled south into the @entity3 , " the authority said in a statement			1
four search aircraft are now over the new area , with six more due to fly there over the course of friday , said @entity29 , the authority 's general manager of emergency response			1
the renewed search for flight 370 in the southern @entity3 comes a day after @entity35 and @entity36 both said they 'd sent new satellite images to @entity38 showing separate debris fields that could be related to the plane , which vanished march 8 with 239 people aboard			1
analysts said the search area shift could be a sign that investigators are closing in on the missing plane 's whereabouts			1
" with this development , perhaps they 're able to hone in on the more accurate altitude , " said @entity48 , a @entity49 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity52 @entity51			2
that , experts said , could bring investigators closer to determining what happened aboard the plane , what caused it to veer off course and where it ended up			1
satellite images raise hope in addition to the @entity35 and @entity36 satellite images , @entity38 officials announced wednesday that a @entity69 satellite had found 122 pieces of something floating nearby			1
it 's enough to make you wonder : have they found that proverbial haystack inside which they 'll find the well - hidden wreckage ? maybe			1
search teams will have at least one more plane in their fleet starting friday , when a second @entity82 @entity81 will fly from @entity83 , @entity35 , to @entity84 , @entity85 , to join the hunt for the missing aircraft			1
" from the pilot and the aircrew perspective , they are optimistic , " said @entity88			2
@entity92 of the @entity52 @entity93			2
" i know every day , when they launch a flight , they have a good feeling about finding something			2
but the satellite imagery has n't been conclusive			2
" there 's one thing that @entity92 said would be a defining moment in the search : visual confirmation from the search crews at sea			1
while analysts say it 's intriguing that the finds all appear to be in the same general area , searchers have yet to lay eyes on any of the objects , much less haul one aboard a ship and examine it			1
satellite images that have been followed up on have not produced any sightings for search teams , said @entity29 of the @entity85 maritime authority			1
" that may change in the future , " he added			0
the @entity124 is directing satellites to capture images of the new area , authorities said			1
@entity128 , a former @entity129 analyst and satellite imagery expert , said the satellites could be seeing something as simple as whitecaps , which he said can look deceptively like solid objects			1
@entity49 aviation analyst @entity135 said that while the latest find is " very enticing , " the number and size of the objects make him question whether they could be from the plane			1
" if you see something floating that 's 60 feet across , that could be a big chunk of fuselage , " he said			1
" but if you have 10 pieces that are 60 feet across , that would indicate that they 're not from the plane , because the plane has only so much stuff in it			1
" but @entity152 , another @entity49 aviation analyst , said what he sees on the latest satellite images does n't look like everyday garbage to him			1
" what i see there is something that seems to be somewhat metallic and shiny			0
looks like airplane wreckage to me			0
i also see some surfaces that look like they 're aerodynamic			0
" @entity162 , an aviation expert and editor - in - chief of @entity164 , said he does n't have any doubts about the satellite images			1
" the debris pictures we 're getting now , they absolutely have to be wreckage from this airplane , " he told @entity49 's " @entity172			1
" " they 're too big , there 's too many of them			1
and certainly , we get debris in the ocean , unfortunately , but not of this scale , not of this size			0
" authorities , he said , must know more than they 're letting on			1
" i think they know exactly that this is the airplane , " he said			0
" and hopefully , in a few days , we 're going to get someone picking a piece up out of the water and saying , ' this is it			0
' " loved ones holding out hope with no physical evidence pointing to what happened to the plane , loved ones of the passengers onboard have said they 're still holding out hope			2
@entity196 , the partner of @entity52 passenger @entity197 , said she 's not convinced by the authorities ' argument that an analysis of satellite data shows that there were no survivors			1
the plane , she told @entity49 's " @entity205 , " could have landed somewhere			1
" i do believe it 's still a possibility , because there 's no contradictory evidence to that being a possibility			2
even the satellite data that 's been pushed forward to show or to demonstrate that the flight took the southerly route , they 're really just still guessing , " she said			1
" i mean , this is not something that anybody has ever done before			0
so , you know , as brilliant as those mathematicians are , they do n't really know			0
they 're only analyzing the data that they have			0
they do n't really know for certain			0
" the confusion has left many family members of missing passengers and crew increasingly frustrated			0
some have accused @entity38 authorities of failing to keep them properly informed			2
others have accused officials of lying or covering up facts			0
@entity196 said she first learned that authorities believed there were no survivors from a text message @entity7 sent to passengers ' families			2
" the wording of the message led me to believe that they were going to be giving evidence that it was found , right ? that there were bodies ... and then all he did is say they 've extrapolated the data and they 're sure that it went into the water			0
i mean , i think that was extremely irresponsible			0
" ' unspeakable challenge ' for families mystery surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy concerns about weather , currents @entity38 officials have defended their handling of the situation , arguing that they 've released information as soon as possible to families and the public			0
in recent days , authorities ' announcements have focused on the satellite images			1
now the search is on for the physical evidence to back them up			2
the @entity36 images show about 300 objects ranging in size from 6 feet ( 2 meters ) to 50 feet ( 15 meters )			1
when photographed monday , they were about 125 miles ( 201 kilometers ) away from the spot where a @entity69 satellite captured a floating group of objects sunday			0
the @entity35 images were taken wednesday and show about 10 objects floating in a six - mile ( 10 kilometer ) radius some 1,550 miles ( 2,500 kilometers ) off the west coast of @entity85 , according to the @entity35 @entity282			1
the biggest object was square and measured some 13 feet by 26 feet ( 4 meters to 8 meters ) , the agency said			0
the finds come after news wednesday that a @entity69 satellite had seen 122 objects in the same region and follows earlier sightings by @entity52 , @entity291 and another @entity69 satellite			0
planes are set to try to find the materials and figure out what they are on friday after rough weather in the remote spot once again delayed search efforts thursday			2
by then , experts say , these objects could have drifted hundreds of miles in the complex currents of the @entity3			0
' i understand him ' meanwhile , the youngest son of missing @entity308 pilot @entity307 has broken his family 's silence on the plane 's disappearance , rejecting speculation that the longtime aviator was somehow responsible			1
" i 've read everything online			0
but i 've ignored all the speculation			0
i know my father better , " @entity317 , 26 , said in an interview published thursday by the @entity319 , an @entity320 - language @entity38 newspaper			0
the idea that @entity317 or co-pilot @entity308 were responsible for the plane 's baffling disappearance is one of many theories investigators continue to pursue			1
one line of speculation suggests @entity317 might have hijacked the plane as a political act			2
he has been identified as a supporter of a high - profile @entity38 opposition figure			0
his son rejected such theories			0
" we may not be as close , as he travels so much			0
but i understand him , " he said of his father in the interview , which was conducted tuesday			0
comments from government officials on the investigation so far support the son 's view			2
a senior @entity38 government official wednesday told @entity49 law enforcement analyst @entity347 that authorities have found nothing in 19 days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive , be it political , suicidal or extremist			2
and an ongoing @entity357 review of the two pilots ' hard drives , including one in a flight simulator @entity317 had built at his home , has not turned up a " smoking gun , " a @entity52 official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity49			0
" they have accessed the data , " the official said			0
" there is nothing that 's jumping out and grabbing us right now			2
" and investigators have n't found anything suspicious with any of the other crew members or passengers , leaving them struggling to find an explanation			2
" i do n't think there is a prevailing theory , " one @entity52 official told @entity49			0
" there are counterarguments to every theory right now			0
" questions linger did flammable cargo doom flight ? how they 're searching for debris			0
