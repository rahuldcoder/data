any necessary follow - up care will be provided free of charge by the health department and the hospital			0
the infected health care worker is no longer working and is receiving treatment , the owner of the hospital , @entity38 , said in a statement			1
@entity4 is an infectious disease that generally causes coughing , chest pain and difficulty breathing , according to the @entity44			1
an estimated 2 billion people worldwide have what 's called latent @entity4 , where the bacteria remain dormant and do n't cause symptoms			2
" once in the body , the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active @entity4 , " the @entity49 of @entity6 's @entity8 said in a statement			1
" that is why it is so important to identify people who may have been exposed , screen them , and provide treatment			0
" the bacteria that cause @entity4 spread through the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes , but it 's not a highly contagious disease ; close contact over a longer period of time is required before another person becomes infected , according to the @entity44			1
only active tb can be spread			0
the @entity68 conducted an on - site investigation at @entity14 last week and cited the hospital " for deficiencies that represent immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety , " said @entity75 , the department 's director of media relations			0

he said @entity83 is giving the hospital until october 11 to identify policy changes that need to happen to ensure something like this wo n't happen again			0
if the hospital fails to do so , its @entity93 and @entity94 funding will be cut off			0
" this is one of the largest tb exposure investigations we 've ever been involved in , and it involves infants , so it is particularly sensitive , " @entity75 said			0
" babies are more likely than older children and adults to develop life - threatening forms of @entity4			2
" patients with @entity4 must take antibiotics for six to nine months			2
some strains of @entity4 are resistant to antibiotics , which makes them more dangerous			2
without treatment , @entity4 can be fatal , the @entity44 says			2
