we just looked at the mange and said , ' it 's treatable ; this is a young dog that will grow up to live a happy life			2
' " the home @entity92 's foster family had taught him about a dozen hand signals for basic commands , and the @entity97 were ready to give @entity11 his happy ending â€” as long as timid @entity37 could handle an energetic , 75 - pound male companion			1
his next big hurdle would be a home visit			2
on february 11 , @entity11 joined his forever family			1

" @entity10 finds a @entity150 also chose to honor the life of her boxer , @entity152 , by fostering another dog			1
she was all set to care for a female puppy when @entity44 posted photos of a male named @entity10			1
at only 4 months old , his body was covered with sores caused by severe mange and @entity10 required daily medicated baths			1
" it just broke my heart , " @entity161 says			0
" he was so sickly and so bad off and i knew he was going to need a lot of care			0
at that time , i could n't say no. i reached out and said , ' somebody else take this female who is healthy and will probably get adopted pretty quickly			0
' " @entity75 : 7 incredibly loyal dogs meeting her new @entity170 the day after @entity172 , @entity161 met @entity10 and worked on his recovery			1
doubts began to creep in when she gave @entity10 his first medicated bath , treating wounds that spread from his muzzle to his paws			1
but @entity161 pushed those thoughts aside and focused on caring for the pup , administering pills and hand - feeding @entity183 until he gained strength			0
