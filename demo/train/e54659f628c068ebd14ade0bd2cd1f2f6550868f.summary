@entity3 , @entity1 this week pope @entity0 will set foot on @entity1 soil			1
his pastoral visit is the fourth time our country will be graced by the presence of the @entity10			2
in 1970 blessed pope @entity11 included the @entity1 in his apostolic pilgrimage to @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity15 came to the @entity1 twice -- in 1981 and in 1995 for the @entity16			2
twenty years later , we welcome @entity0			1
every papal visit is unique , bearing the influence of the unique personalities of the popes and the changing circumstances in the country , the @entity24 and the world			0
preparing the nation in one conversation i had with @entity0 he expressed a wish , " i am not supposed to be the focus of the apostolic trip to the @entity1			1
@entity32 should be the focus			2
" i have tried my best to communicate this expectation of the holy father to the @entity1 nation and to those involved in the preparation for the visit			2
his sentiment should be our sentiment too			0
his @entity43 - centered understanding of his pilgrimage should provide us with the pivotal point of the many events that would occur			0
the theme of the apostolic visit -- " mercy and compassion " -- should be qualified as the mercy and compassion of @entity32 manifested in the @entity53			2
in the light of this desire of the @entity11 i would like to emphasize a few expectations of the visit			1
year of the @entity58 first , @entity0 comes after the celebration of the @entity60 in the @entity1 , which was observed in 2014			1
we await the impetus and encouragement that the @entity10 of @entity64 would give to our lay faithful in deepening their personal encounter with @entity32 , and in bringing the gospel of @entity32 to all aspects of life -- conscience , family , culture , politics , finance , science , arts , sports , migration , labor , ecumenism , inter-religious dialogue , and social communications			1
we await the @entity11 's word to the ordained and consecrated men and women on how to foster communion with the lay faithful			2
we await the @entity11 to send us again as missionaries wherever we are , especially in @entity13			0
we eagerly await @entity0 to strengthen us as @entity32 once told @entity64 , " i have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail , and you , when once you have turned back , strengthen your brothers			1
" ( @entity93 22:32 ) hearing the message but we must listen to @entity0			0
it is not enough that we see him , come close to him or even touch him			0
we have been begging the @entity1 people to listen to the @entity98 that would reach us through the holy father			0
the apostolic visit will make a difference to the @entity24 and society only if we listen and act on what we have heard			0
secondly , @entity0 comes after a series of natural and human - caused disasters that the @entity1 people experienced in 2013 and 2014 : earthquakes , typhoons ( the strongest of which was @entity108 ) and armed conflicts			1
but let us not forget the daily disaster of poverty and inequality as seen in children and families living on the streets , homeless people , human trafficking , unemployment and underemployment , forced migration , prostitution , illegal drugs , corruption , missing persons and environmental degradation			0
mercy and compassion pope @entity0 will bring the mercy and compassion of @entity32 to the tired , weary and those who find life burdensome			1
they await the assurance that @entity32 remains the shepherd who has compassion for the hungry crowds			0
we await the renewed challenge for the ordained and religious to embody the love , patience and healing of the @entity32 as they bring the good news to the poor			2
we await the call of the @entity11 to the shapers of government , culture and the economy to return to love as the supreme law that must shape their policies and programs			0
we await the @entity99 to encourage all efforts to forge peace , especially in parts of @entity157 and to promote good will among peoples of different religions			0
we eagerly await in @entity0 the love that @entity64 once professed to @entity32 who asked him , " @entity162 , do you love me more than these ? " ( @entity166 21:15 ) love for @entity32 this love for @entity32 made @entity64 a shepherd with the mission of feeding and tending the sheep of @entity32			1
we will see pope @entity0 ' love for @entity32 in his pastoral charity towards us			1
finally , @entity0 comes to us as one like us , or in his own words " as a regular human being , " a sinner who has experienced @entity178 's mercy			0
his simple words and gestures will make @entity32 and the @entity24 more accessible to @entity1			1
we await the @entity10 : a brother , a father and a friend			0
the @entity1 people are filled with joy			0
pope @entity0 gets huge @entity1 welcome amid calls for change			1

pope @entity0 ' trip to the @entity1 will be the fourth @entity99 visit and first in 20 years
@entity11 has expressed a desire that the visit should be not focus on him : " @entity32 should be the focus "
visit should be an *opportunity* for @entity1 to bring the gospel of @entity32 to all aspects of life
