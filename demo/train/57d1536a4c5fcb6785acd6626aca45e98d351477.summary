-- are criminal charges just the beginning of @entity4 's legal troubles ? depending on how things play out , the @entity6 citizen could also have an immigration case to worry about			1
# @entity9 trended on @entity10 last week , with critics pushing authorities to send the teen pop star north of the border after he was arrested in @entity14 , @entity15 , on suspicion of drunk driving , resisting arrest and driving without a valid license			1
it 's not likely @entity4 will be kicked out of the @entity21 , immigration law experts say			1
but even so , criminal charges could complicate things for the 19 - year - old singer -- and if he 's charged with and convicted of any drug offenses , that could change the equation			1
what crimes lead to deportation ? in addition to the charges he faces in @entity15 , investigators in @entity31 are also weighing whether @entity4 will face a felony vandalism charge tied to an egg attack there			1
immigration lawyers say convictions on those charges would n't generally lead to deportation for someone like @entity4 , who has a visa allowing him to legally live in the @entity21 because of his " extraordinary ability " in the arts			1
that 's because those charges are n't considered to be aggravated felonies or crimes of moral turpitude -- the two types of crimes that federal law defines as grounds for the deportation of non-citizen immigrants			1
and according to federal law , only violent crimes and sentences longer than one year result in a re-evaluation of a person 's visa status			2
translation for those of you who are n't legal eagles : @entity4 's probably not going anywhere			1
but when it comes to deportation proceedings , it 's not a simple matter			2
" it 's a very complex area of immigration law , " said @entity72 , a @entity31 immigration lawyer			1
an " aggravated felony " sounds severe			0
and often they are ; crimes like murder , rape or sexual abuse are among the violations that fit that description			0
but crimes that might sound less serious to the average person can also be considered aggravated felonies			0
in 2000 , for example , a federal appeals court determined that a man with a green card was an aggravated felon after a misdemeanor conviction for stealing @entity91 and cigarettes , according to the @entity94 project at @entity95 , which follows immigration trends and statistics			0
sometimes , @entity72 said , a crime considered a misdemeanor at the state level is viewed as a felony by federal immigration officials			2
the bottom line : until investigators finish weighing their options and the criminal case against @entity4 proceeds , it 's impossible to predict how his immigration status could be impacted			1
drugs could change the equation after his arrest in @entity15 last week , @entity4 " made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol , and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication , " @entity14 police chief @entity113 said			1
since then , breathalyzer tests have suggested @entity4 was not too drunk to legally drive when he was pulled over by @entity14 police early thursday			0
but it could be two or three weeks before tests that should give a more accurate blood - alcohol reading and could tell if he was high on pot are back from the lab. when authorities searched @entity4 's @entity31 home earlier this month , a deputy found suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of @entity4 house guest @entity134 , who now faces a felony drug charge			1
but a detective who searched other parts of the home told @entity0 last week that he saw " no sign of drugs " there			0
@entity4 has n't been charged with any drug - related crimes in connection with either case			1
but if drugs were involved , that could change the equation when it comes to immigration issues , experts say			2
" he may have a difficult time returning to the @entity21 after traveling , " @entity72 said			0
" if there is a conviction on the use of marijuana , he may run into some issues when renewing his visa or even attempting to apply for residency			0
" and if authorities add a drug charge into the mix , that could eventually put deportation on the table , said @entity163 , an attorney in @entity14 who wrote a widely used reference book on immigration law			1
" deportation grounds for drug - related crimes are broadly defined , " @entity163 said			2
but a drunk - driving charge that is n't drug - related , he said , " is not a basis to deport somebody			2
" decision near on @entity4 's egging charge ; singer takes it easy in @entity176 a double standard ? @entity4 was released thursday from a @entity14 jail an hour after he made a brief appearance through a video link before a judge , who set a $ 2,500 bond that afternoon			1
since his arrest , some critics have wondered whether @entity4 would n't be deported for reasons that have little to do with the law			0
in a @entity0 opinion column last week , @entity0 contributor @entity188 suggested the wealthy singer 's star status might be getting him special treatment			0
" @entity4 has an estimated net worth of about $ 130 million , " @entity188 wrote			0
" i bet that , right about now , many of those @entity197 immigrants who were deported because they came to the attention of local police officers for a burned - out taillight , or for not making a complete stop at an intersection , are wishing that they had been a rich , white kid with marginal music ability and too much money			0
if so , things might have gone differently for them			0
" but @entity72 says there 's a key difference between such examples and @entity4 's case : he has a visa			2
" the reason an individual who had failed to stop at a stop sign or is driving without a license comes in contact with immigration authorities is because they 're undocumented , " @entity72 said			0
" you 're not comparing apples to apples			0
" @entity0 's @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report .			0

immigration lawyers say it 's unlikely @entity4 will face deportation
if he 's charged with and convicted of drug offenses , that could change the equation
