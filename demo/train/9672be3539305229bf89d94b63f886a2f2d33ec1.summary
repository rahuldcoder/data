-- @entity1 and @entity2 have dueling opinion pieces about foreign policy in the @entity5 on friday , but neither former presidential candidate appeared to take a stand on the current debate dominating the foreign policy arena : how to deal with @entity10			1
reviewing former secretary of state @entity13 's book " @entity15 , " @entity11 writes that she and president @entity17 share a similar world view as @entity13 , one that 's rooted in " a belief in the indispensability of continued @entity23 leadership in service of a just and liberal order			1
" showing off its crimes : how @entity10 flaunts its brutality as propaganda @entity11 , who 's thinking about another run for president in 2016 , argues that what makes the country a leader is not only its military strength but its " soft power " -- its values , relationships and diplomacy			1
she likes to call it " smart power			0
" while she does n't mention the emerging crisis related to @entity10 , she writes , " it 's time for another of our great debates about what @entity23 means to the world and what the world means to @entity23			0
" " we need to have an honest conversation together -- all of us -- about the costs and imperatives of global leadership , and what it really takes to keep our country safe and strong , " the @entity52 writes			0
@entity1 , in his op - ed , argues that the dominating force that keeps the @entity23 on top is its military strength and that one ca n't equate that with soft - power values			1
widely seen as the @entity66 's party elder , @entity1 warns that decreasing military budgets can lead to disastrous outcomes			2
" the most ludicrous excuse for shrinking our military derives from the president 's thinking : ' things are much less dangerous now than they were 20 years ago , 25 years ago or 30 years ago			2
' the ' safer world ' trial balloon has been punctured by recent events in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , " the 2012 @entity66 nominee writes			0
" ' failures of imagination ' led to tragedy 13 years ago ; today , no imagination is required to picture what would descend on the @entity23 if we let down our guard , " he continues			0
former @entity97 man may be helping with chilling @entity10 social media , source says while both spell out a general sense of their ideas on @entity23 leadership , neither offers a clear position on the current dilemma over how @entity17 should go about dismantling @entity10 , the @entity105 militant group seeking to create a " caliphate " in the @entity107			0
" we have @entity2 sort of arguing in the abstract for this sort of pragmatism , and interestingly aligning herself with the legacy of @entity13 ... but she does n't give any answer , she does n't take sides on any of the debates going on , " @entity108 of the @entity109 said friday on @entity0 's " @entity110 with @entity111			2
" " and @entity1 is the same way , " she continues			2
" he 's saying we should n't cut the military			0
well , that 's not the debate we 're having right now			0
" the dueling op - eds also set the stage for the next two political cycles			0
on @entity0 , @entity111 asked whether foreign policy would become the major conversation driver in the midterm elections and become the early big topic in the 2016 debate			1
@entity108 argued that it will probably be " background noise " in the upcoming elections but wo n't be a decisive factor , as most races will still be based on the economy and state - specific issues			1
" but absolutely , this is going to be the debate in 2016 , especially with @entity2 at the center of it , " she said			1
@entity142 of the @entity5 said , " traditionally , voters do n't really vote on foreign policy , and you wonder if @entity2 , as a candidate potentially , if that 's going to change , " she added .			1

@entity1 and @entity2 offer *differing* viewpoints on foreign policy
both have *previously* run for president , and @entity11 is thinking about running in 2016
political *observers* expect foreign policy to be a leading topic in upcoming elections
