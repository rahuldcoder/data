zero tolerance " we believe that the eight - year disqualification issued to @entity9 , together with the six - month racing restriction placed on the horses in question by the @entity16 , will serve to reassure the public , and the sport 's participants , that use of performance - enhancing substances in @entity8 racing will not be tolerated , " said @entity16 chief executive @entity32			1
