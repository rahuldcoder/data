authorities announced last week that @entity14 -- who besides being a onetime chief executive of @entity4 , which is the division of @entity10 that includes the company 's @entity12 newspapers , also had been editor of @entity20 tabloid -- was among those being charged in the high - profile case			1

the announced names of the suspected hacking victims include some of the world 's biggest celebrities , including @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and soccer star @entity53			0

others charged in the case include @entity64 , an editor at @entity20 who went on to become director of communications for @entity12 prime minister @entity66 before resigning			1
according to thursday 's release from @entity2 police , @entity38 was charged on three offenses			1
the first claims that she -- along with @entity64 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 -- conspired between october 3 , 2000 , and august 9 , 2006 , " to intercept communications in the course of their transmission , without lawful authority			0
