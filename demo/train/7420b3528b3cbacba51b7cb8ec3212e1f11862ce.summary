@entity0 -- from @entity2 in @entity0 to @entity3 in @entity4 ' , the sight of @entity7 shoppers flocking to luxury clothing stores is now a familiar one for many in the @entity10			1
with its seemingly insatiable appetite for @entity14 and @entity15 luxury brands , @entity11 accounts for more than a quarter of the global luxury market -- and that number is growing , according to market analysts like @entity19 but the rising fashion credentials of the country 's consumers is not the only reason people are talking about @entity11 on the sidelines of this season 's runway shows in @entity0 and @entity28			1
a new , young generation of @entity7 fashion designers is causing a stir within stylish circles			1
read more : will @entity7 designers get left behind in @entity11 's fashion boom ? as @entity35 begins tuesday , marking the culmination of the fashion world 's twice - yearly dash between @entity4 , @entity0 , @entity39 and @entity28 , these @entity7 designers are yet again raising their profile in the traditional style capitals of the world			1
one of those hoping to show that the flow of sartorial capital not only goes from @entity10 to @entity46 , but also vice versa , is @entity48			0
originally from @entity49 in northeast @entity11 , he trained at @entity50 in @entity0 , graduating in 2005			2
@entity48 then came to the attention of the fashion world last year after winning the @entity53 for young designers and was mentored by @entity56 's chief creative officer , @entity55			2
like many of the emerging @entity7 - born , @entity62 - educated generation of designers , the influence of @entity48 's home culture on his work is subtle			1
while his collection was inspired mainly by gothic architecture , @entity48 says his @entity7 roots underlie everything he produces			2
read more : ' made in @entity11 ' is finally cool " even if you ca n't see any obvious @entity70 influences , like dragons for example , across my pieces , the man who made this collection -- me -- is @entity7 and that will always be there , even though i was trained in the @entity10			1
" also epitomizing this new generation of @entity7 designers is 29 year - old @entity79			1
he combines his @entity62 training -- he spent a year with @entity81 in @entity28 -- with his @entity7 heritage			1
tipped by international fashion insiders as the one to watch in 2013 , his first collection -- stocked at @entity84 -- sold out within a month			0
@entity79 spends several months each year back in @entity11 , where he sources all his hand - sewn fabrics from near to where he grew up in @entity88 , on the eastern coast			0
he says that a big challenge for @entity7 designers is convincing people that " @entity93 " can mean high - quality			1
" we are really trying to learn and show people what we are capable of , " @entity79 explains			0
he says @entity11 and the @entity10 can learn a lot from each other when it comes to design			0
@entity79 's @entity101 2013 collection incorporates some noticeable @entity7 influences			1
one piece in particular provides more than a nod to @entity11 's recent history			0
his version of the " @entity107 , " a staple symbol of uniformity under the communist regime , has been updated with pink lace and diamante buttons and is the center - piece of his collection			0
traditionally worn by men , @entity79 says the piece partly represents giving " the power back to the woman and not the man "			0
as designers like @entity79 tap into the changing social norms of @entity7 society , so he and others are taking note of the evolving fashion tastes in the country			1
he notes how much things have changed since the @entity128 of the 1960s and 1970s when @entity11 was largely cut off from the rest of the world			0
" we now have this amazing opportunity to get in touch with the whole world , " @entity79 says			0
he explains that because @entity7 people until fairly recently had very limited wardrobes , there is a now a huge hunger there for new fashion			0
@entity11 is now such a key driver of global profit for the fashion industry that @entity56 's stock price sank in early february after @entity11 announced it would ban advertising of luxury goods			1
@entity147 , the designer and film director whose name is almost synonymous with luxury and style , says he is closely watching how @entity7 consumers are maturing			2
@entity153 observes that -- as in other emerging markets -- @entity11 is moving away from the initial lust for designer logos that tends to characterise the newly rich			1
" tastes become quite refined and equalized with the rest of the luxury consumer all over the world ... i think that 's really starting to happen in @entity11 and it 's moving very quickly			2
" @entity163 , founding editor of @entity11 , agrees that @entity7 consumers have been on a huge learning curve over the last decade , and says her magazine has played a significant role in their sartorial education			2
" we constantly emphasize the importance in knowing how to appreciate fashion , for example , we educate our readers on the history of couture and the great couturiers , " @entity168 explains			0
" these are all aspects that , due to historical circumstance in @entity11 , our readers had little exposure to previously			0
" she adds that niche @entity7 designers are doing increasingly well not because of patriotism , but because people appreciate their designs and their quality			2
@entity48 recognizes that his home country has huge market potential for him , but he feels that he still had to come to @entity14 in order to create his brand and get the training that would make big buyers take him seriously			0
" @entity11 's education system has a long way to go before it can produce a designer capable of being a global brand and taking on the international market , " he says			0
" i 'm sure one day it will happen though			0
" fashion legend @entity198 seems to agree , recently declaring he was sure that sooner or later @entity11 would produce a designer who shows in @entity0 , @entity39 and @entity28			1
it might be a while before @entity202 is taken as seriously as @entity28 by the fashion cognoscenti , but industry heavyweights are switching on to the fact that @entity11 is now firmly on the front row of global fashion .			1
