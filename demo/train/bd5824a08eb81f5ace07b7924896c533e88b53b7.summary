-- @entity2 's air force has repeatedly carried out " indiscriminate , and in some cases deliberate " airstrikes against civilians , @entity3 said in a new report			1
the attacks are serious violations of international humanitarian law , and those who commit such violations with criminal intent are responsible for war crimes , the rights group said			1
the claims are laid out in an 80 - page report titled " @entity19 , " based on visits to 50 sites of government airstrikes in opposition - controlled areas in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity28 provinces			0
the group 's researchers carried out more than 140 interviews with witnesses and victims			0
" in village after village , we found a civilian population terrified by their country 's own air force , " said @entity34 , a researcher for the rights group , who visited the sites and conducted many of the interviews			1
" these illegal airstrikes killed and injured many civilians and sowed a path of destruction , fear and displacement			0
" @entity3 said bakeries and hospitals have been targeted , in violation of the laws of war			1
but @entity56 , a lawmaker in the @entity2 parliament , questioned the accuracy of the @entity3 report			1
@entity2 jihad group pledges allegiance to @entity62 no military target , group says for the report , @entity3 documented in detail eight airstrikes on four bakeries			1
its research " indicates government forces targeted bakeries and civilians waiting in breadlines in airstrikes as well as in artillery attacks , " the group said			1
" for each of these attacks , @entity3 was not able to identify any military target , such as fighters or weapons , in the vicinity			0
" it cites the @entity83 , a local opposition group , as saying @entity2 forces have attacked 78 bakeries across @entity2 , either by airstrikes or artillery shelling			1
repeated airstrikes on two hospitals in the areas @entity3 visited " strongly suggest that the government also deliberately targeted these facilities			2
" the rights group accuses the @entity2 armed forces of using means such as unguided bombs , and methods such as fighter jets and high - flying helicopters , " that under the circumstances could not distinguish between civilians and combatants , and thus were indiscriminate			1
" altogether , the airstrikes documented by @entity3 killed at least 152 civilians , though the actual number is probably higher			1
according to a network of local @entity2 activists , airstrikes have killed more than 4,300 civilians across @entity2 since july 2012 , the rights group said			2
@entity0 is unable to independently confirm reports of casualties in @entity2 because access by international media is heavily restricted			2
@entity115 signs off on new aid ' political accusations ' @entity56 , the pro-government lawmaker , told @entity118 that the information available to lawmakers , based on intelligence reports , indicates " that the @entity2 military air force only strike the locations of the terrorist armed groups , " the term the government uses for rebel forces			1
" for months , the majority of the reports issued by international organizations and some even by the @entity128 include blatant political accusations rather than factual or technical investigations			0
" there is no benefit for the regime to target civilians who are already suffering from the criminal acts carried out by the terrorist organizations that the regime troops are fighting			2
" the @entity2 government has accused rights group of misrepresenting the facts and favoring the " terrorist groups " it says are behind the violence in @entity2			1
@entity3 points out that the obligation to minimize harm to civilians applies to all parties to a conflict and that the rebels are not blameless			2
" the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) and other @entity2 armed opposition groups did not take all feasible measures to avoid deploying forces and structures such as headquarters in or near densely populated areas , " the report said			1
opinion : @entity2 rebel group 's dangerous tie to @entity62 rebels say they downed helicopter meanwhile , a @entity167 video posted by @entity2 activists thursday claimed that rebel fighters had shot down a @entity2 military helicopter , killing four crew members on board			2
the @entity173 , an opposition group , said rebel fighters shot down the helicopter north of @entity176			0
it was carrying food supplies to two regime bases , @entity180 and @entity181 , which have been under siege by the rebels for several months , the observatory said			0
@entity0 could not independently verify the claim			0
the bases are strategically important to forces loyal to @entity2 president @entity187			2
if the rebels took them , it would enable their forces to cut off the single route in @entity26 that the government uses to supply troops operating in @entity25			0
the rebels already control the border crossings with @entity197 in the north , so the government would be forced to use a more difficult route going from @entity28			0
opinion : before taking on @entity2 , @entity202 should heed lesson of the past in a @entity206 city , opposition cites a massacre civilians were killed when @entity2 forces used air cover to storm the city of @entity213 in @entity206 province wednesday , the opposition said			1
@entity206 is where the anti-government uprising got going more than two years ago			0
the @entity217 in @entity2 called the act a massacre , saying at least 60 people were killed and @entity187 's government used civilians as shields to hold off rebels			1
more than 200 people were detained , homes were burned , and snipers targeted more than 10 civilian - filled cars fleeing to safety , the @entity217 said			0
the @entity231 , representing the anti-government fighters , said the action illustrated " the lust of killing and thirst for blood in the hearts of those belonging to the criminal regime of @entity187			0
" " the criminals shelled the town ( and ) then they stormed it , allowing their loyalists to commit despicable atrocities against civilians			0
they took hostages as human shields			0
they also slaughtered people and committed vandalism and theft			0
these despicable acts against women , children and unarmed civilians indicate how the regime is incapable to confront the men of the revolution and the free @entity2 army , as well as the failure to stop the liberation of @entity206 province			2
" at least 149 people were killed across the country on thursday , the @entity217 said			0
