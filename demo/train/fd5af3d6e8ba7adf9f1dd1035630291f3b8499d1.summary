-- it 's been that type of year for @entity3			1
@entity3 collected her 18th grand slam singles title at the @entity6 in september to match retired legends @entity7 and @entity9 but prior to that did n't get past the fourth round at the three other majors in 2014			1
the world no. 1 recently retired due to illness in @entity15 , @entity16 and then was a walkover in @entity18 with a knee injury -- and on wednesday at the @entity20 finals in @entity21 she suffered the joint worst loss of her career			2
@entity24 battered @entity3 6 - 0 6 - 2 to leave the two - time defending champion in danger of being eliminated in the group stage			1
it matched the number of games won by @entity3 in 1998 -- when she was just 16 -- against @entity32 's @entity31 in @entity33			2
@entity3 , two days after looking sharp in defeating @entity34 , made 36 unforced errors in the 14 games and the encounter lasted a mere one hour and five minutes			2
while @entity24 went 5 - for - 6 on break points , @entity3 went 0 - for - 6			1
" embarrassed is the way i would describe how i played , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" " my forehand was off today			0
it 's obviously gone on an early vacation			0
my serve was at best at the 10 - and - under division of juniors			0
" @entity24 improved to 2 - 0 in the @entity47			1
the @entity53 -- one of two debutants at the @entity20 finals along with @entity52 's @entity51 -- entered the year - end championships in patchy form but she limited her own unforced errors and covered the court with aplomb			1
@entity24 had lost both her matches to @entity3 last year , with the latter inflicting two " bagels " -- or 6 - 0 sets -- of her own			1
" it was my best match of my life , " @entity24 told reporters			0
" i played unbelievable shots			0
at an important time i played really well and after today my confidence will be more high			0
" @entity34 eased past a listless @entity51 6 - 1 6 - 3 later wednesday			1
both players hit 20 winners but @entity51 committed 31 unforced errors compared to the @entity72 's 18			0
@entity73 and her pal @entity74 posted upset wins tuesday over @entity76 and @entity77 , respectively .			0

@entity3 loses 6 - 0 6 - 2 to @entity24 at the year - end championships
it 's @entity3 ' worst defeat since she lost 6 - 1 6 - 1 in @entity33 in 1998
the result adds to the *inconsistent* *season* for the 18 - time grand slam winner
@entity24 leads the @entity47 with a *perfect* 2 - 0 record while @entity3 *falls* to 1 - 1
