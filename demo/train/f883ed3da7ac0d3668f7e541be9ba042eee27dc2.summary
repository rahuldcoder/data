-- @entity1 , whose television adventures on the fictional island of @entity5 have delighted children around the world for years , is now on a real - life mission to help kids with autism			1
@entity1 is part of a new online game to help autistic children recognize different emotions			1
the steam locomotive and his friends are the stars of a new game in @entity20 , designed to help autistic children recognize emotions			1
@entity22 ( @entity23 ) , a nonprofit that provides services to people diagnosed with the developmental disorder , unveiled the game on its web site tuesday			2
the game asks players to recognize which engine has a sad face , or which is happy or angry			1
children with autism often have a difficult time distinguishing different facial expressions			1
each time a child plays the game , he / she is presented with a different sequence of emotions			2

" it 's a great way to help develop social and communication skills , " said @entity45 of @entity23			0
a study conducted in the @entity49 found that autistic children were far more fascinated by the television series , " @entity53 , " than they were with other fictional characters			1

@entity45 said one of the reasons @entity1 is particularly stimulating and motivating for children with autism is that it 's very predictable			2

and the emotions are primary emotions			0
" autism is a developmental disorder that affects physical , social and language skills			0
it usually appears before age 3 , though the earliest signs are subtle			0
