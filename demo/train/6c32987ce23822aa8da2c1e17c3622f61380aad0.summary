-- i was 17 when my mother died of breast cancer			1
it seemed old to me then			0
as a middle - aged mother myself now , i see it differently			1
forty - two was impossibly young			2
i 've spent more than half my life without my mother			1
does it sound odd to hear that i still miss her , even after 33 years ? i used to think that feeling sad two years , five years , even 10 years after her death meant i 'd somehow grieved wrong			1
but now i know differently			0
@entity12 is a lifelong process , especially for children who lose a mother young			2
when a child loses a mother , maturity often follows quickly			2
" @entity19 " is irrevocably redefined			0
over the years , milestones that bring joy to others may trigger a range of mixed emotions in the motherless			1
graduations , weddings , childbirth , new jobs : these are all times of transition when we long for a mother 's support , encouragement or celebration			1
but when we look over our shoulders for reassurance , a mother is n't there			2
this can lead to a new mourning cycle , where the pain feels fresh and raw			1
it explains why , upon the birth of my first child , i was relieved to have a healthy child , overjoyed to have a daughter ; and also terribly , terribly sad , because my mother would never meet her			2
some transitions are one - time events , like reaching a mother 's age at time of death			1
this is a profound turning point for a motherless woman , who often carries the fear that she 'll die at the same age			0
forty - two was an emotionally charged year for me , but 43 was even stranger			2
i 'm now seven years older than my mother got to be			1
how does an adult daughter even begin to make sense of that ? in the 20 years since the publication of " @entity64 " i 've met thousands of motherless women , all around the globe			1
many of them have found mother substitutes in grandmothers , aunts , sisters or good friends			2
that was never true for me			0
my greatest source of comfort has come from other women like myself			0
we " get " each other , right away			0
we cry in the back of school concerts because we 're equally proud and sad			0
we raise our children to be independent just in case we , too , die young			0
and we understand , whether we 're mothers or not , how @entity84 weekend can be a double - edged sword			1
motherless women -- as well as daughters who have estranged or difficult relationships with their mothers -- really have no culturally sanctioned way to recognize their mothers on @entity84			1
so we 're free to create our own			0
here are some ideas from two decades of interviews with motherless women and 33 years of spending @entity84 without my own : attend a local @entity98 luncheon			1
more than two dozen groups of women throughout the country , from @entity102 , @entity103 , to @entity104 to @entity106 plan luncheons on the day before @entity84 ( or soon after ) to honor mothers no longer living			1
during a @entity109 women say their names and their mothers ' names out loud			0
make your mother part of the day			2
if she liked to cook , make one of her recipes			0
put her picture on your mantel			0
tell your children or nieces and nephews a story about her			0
recognizing her will feel better than trying to push the memory away			2
if you have a strained or nonexistent relationship with your mother , use the day to celebrate life instead , in honor of the life she gave you			1
get your hands into the earth and plant seedlings			0
volunteer at an animal shelter			0
do what nurtures and inspires you most			0
this year marks the 100th anniversary of @entity84 as an official , national holiday			1
let 's remember , too , @entity141 , the woman responsible for lobbying president @entity143 to create the national holiday -- and herself a motherless daughter			0
i 'll be celebrating the same as usual : having brunch with my husband and daughters , enjoying a low - key afternoon at home and searching for a way to honor my mother , as i 've done every @entity84 since 1982 , the first i spent without her .			1

@entity156 's mother died when she was 17 . she still grieves her 33 years later
she says kids mature quick when mom dies ; life 's milestones renew mourning cycle
she says @entity84 can be *disorienting* ; she 's comforted by *people* who 've lost moms
@entity156 : recall your mom by life - affirming acts , cooking what she cooked , honoring her memory
