there were no exchanges of gunfire in the operation , the city 's public security chief @entity8 told reporters on sunday , according to @entity15			1
the peaceful operation is in stark contrast to what happened in @entity4 in november , when at least 35 people died in violence set off after drug gangs lashed out at the increased police presence in the crime - ridden slums , which are known as favelas , police said			1
that unrest led to a massive sweep of the @entity30 favela complex that involved about 2,600 police and soldiers			0
this weekend 's operation , which culminated with the raising of a @entity36 flag sunday morning in the @entity38 section of the city , was conducted by about 750 military police personnel			2
@entity36 intelligence agents and marines also played a role , with 14 armored vehicles , five helicopters and gps units all used as part of the operation , @entity15 reported			0

authorities announced that they 'd seized 32 vehicles and 300 packs of marijuana			1
they 'd also served 55 arrest warrants issued in the preceding two months , with three arrested as part of the weekend operation			0
@entity8 defended the decision to give advance notice of the raid , saying it minimized the prospect of violence			0
he added that authorities have information on drug traffickers who fled the area ahead of the operation , saying they will be arrested when the time is right			2
while @entity36 has made significant economic inroads in recent years , poverty and crime remain significant problems in several areas , particularly slums in cities such as @entity4			2
that coastal city is among those that will play host to soccer 's @entity86 , and two years later it will be home to the summer olympics			1
