-- in footballing terms , @entity1 is n't a marquee name in @entity4			1
he endured a miserable stint at behemoth @entity6 and only when he played in a less pressurized environment on another loan deal -- for @entity10 in the @entity11 -- did he excel			0
on the domestic front , it 's an entirely different matter			0
@entity1 can rightly claim to being the talisman for the national team for the past decade or so , featuring in three @entity16 and holding the distinction of scoring more goals than anyone else for the @entity20 he was , unquestionably , the leading figure as the @entity20 transitioned from football minnow to respected outfit			1
if his omission from the @entity27 squad by manager @entity28 could n't be compared to , let 's say , a @entity30 being snubbed by @entity31 or a @entity32 being dropped by @entity33 , it 's not far off			1
" it is a very tight race for those spots , " @entity28 , hired in 2011 and last year given an extension until 2018 , told reporters in may			2
" we feel like the other players , without naming any of those guys , are a tiny bit ahead of him			0
" that 's why we made that decision , which is obviously and understandably the biggest topic out there			0
" most in the @entity20 's growing footballing community have disagreed with the man who " shockingly " left out @entity1 -- that was the word used by the 32 - year - old 's @entity52 team , the @entity46 -- but @entity47 's @entity28 tends to court controversy , or at least divide opinion			1
here 's someone who , for all his scoring prowess during his playing days , will be forever linked with diving			0
@entity60 's challenge on ' @entity61 ' in the 1990 world cup final was reckless but the latter 's exaggerated air time could be compared to a high - jumper performing a forward roll			0
for good measure , when he hit the ground , @entity28 resembled a fish when first out of the water -- flopping from the shock			2
@entity60 became the first player sent off in a @entity27 final and @entity31 's fate was sealed			1
fast forward to his time as @entity47 manager			0
there can be few more uplifting scenarios than an adored former player guiding a national team to @entity27 glory on home soil -- @entity28 made 80 international appearances , netting 38 times -- and the @entity84 indeed almost prevailed in 2006 , falling to bogey side and eventual champion @entity87 in the semifinals			1
but current @entity47 captain @entity89 all but wrote in his autobiography that @entity28 did n't play much of a role , saying he was tactically deficient			2
instead he praised then assistant @entity92 ( who just happens to be @entity89 's current boss with @entity47 )			0
@entity89 lined up , too , under @entity28 at @entity6 in 2008/2009 , when @entity28 did n't last the season			2
@entity28 and @entity89 will meet again , since @entity47 -- as well as @entity33 and @entity95 -- landed in the @entity20 's group			1
" there was very little technical instruction and the players had to get together independently before the game to discuss how we wanted to play , " @entity89 wrote			0
@entity28 's deep focus on fitness and nutrition , and fondness for yoga , is well known			1
players have even been given aptitude tests , not their usual fare			0
" i do n't know if i 'd like his rules , " @entity20 international keeper @entity110 , not making the trip to @entity112 , told @entity0			2
" i 'm way more laid back than most are			0
" i would maybe struggle but that 's the way he wants to run it			0
" judging by a story in the @entity117 last year , @entity110 has company in not being entirely convinced by @entity28 's methods			1
speaking anonymously , people linked with the @entity20 team opened up about @entity28 's apparent tactical naivety , and the author stated there was " building resentment over the perceived importance and attitude of the @entity84 - born players			1
" although it 's not strange for players born in one country to represent another -- in - demand striker @entity133 picked @entity134 over @entity112 for the @entity27 -- @entity28 selected more than merely one : @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 were all born in @entity47			1
@entity6 's @entity140 , meanwhile , mostly represented @entity47 under the senior level			0
" @entity28 has made it clear that looking at all possible options for discovering players will be exhausted , " @entity142 , who earned a century of caps for the @entity20 , told @entity0			1
" my biggest concern is always , ' are you playing for the love of the jersey and what it represents ? ' " if the answer is an emphatic , ' yes , ' i have no problem with it but anything less , i would be concerned			0
" we are in a different era and one that is changing the face of the game			0
" @entity28 's brutal assessment of his charges ' chances at the @entity27 -- " i think for us now , talking about winning a @entity164 is just not realistic " -- also did n't go down well in the court of @entity20 public opinion			1
with all the second guessing , you might be hard pressed to believe that the @entity20 has made inroads under @entity28 , who has lived in @entity170 for more than 15 years and is married to an @entity20			1
but how else to describe the @entity20 beating powerhouse @entity87 for the first time -- in @entity87 -- and overcoming arch - rival @entity173 in @entity173 , also a first ? note that @entity1 played a combined 45 minutes in those landmark successes			1
@entity28 has n't shied away from pushing for friendlies against top sides and has attempted to make the @entity20 play a more proactive brand of football , rather than defend and counter			1
@entity28 has n't been the lone manager targeted by the outspoken @entity89 -- he came down harshly on the new @entity183 manager @entity182 -- and @entity110 admits the @entity20 has " definitely made progress			1
" " in terms of the tactics , he has certainly tried to change the way we play , " added defender @entity185 , who featured against the @entity87			0
" we have the players for it , and i think it 's just going to take some time to adjust to that			2
" you ca n't argue with the results we 've had			0
he 's been very successful as a national team coach , both with @entity47 and with the @entity20			2
" in terms of sports science and that , i think there 's a place for that in football and he 's a very personable man			2
he 's easy to talk to			0
" so , @entity28 has his supporters and detractors			2
results in @entity112 are sure to sway opinion further			0
@entity1 snub sparks outrage @entity112 2014 @entity27 : score updates and schedule of matches @entity27 survival glass tells you when to stop drinking			1

@entity20 manager @entity28 drew *criticism* for *axing* star @entity1
but even before the @entity27 snub , @entity28 was a man who divided opinion
the @entity170 *resident* 's tactics and methods have been questioned by players
the @entity20 has , however , posted some *impressive* results under @entity28
