@entity0 -- if you 've ever found yourself in your local supermarket agonizing about whether the organic apples will be a more nutritional and greener choice than the cheaper non-organic ones , you 're probably not alone			0
a new study reveals organic foods are not necessarily healthier than non-organic food year on year the organic food market grows as consumers look to make a greener and -- often thought -- more nutritional choice			1
a report by the @entity15 's @entity14 revealed that consumers there spent a record $ 3.7 billion on organic products in 2006 , that 's more than 20 percent growth on 2005 spending on organic goods including food , drinks and health and beauty products			2
it 's a similar story in the @entity26 where -- according to the @entity29 -- supermarket chains like @entity28 have helped the organic food and beverage market grow from around $ 1 billion in sales in 1990 to around $ 20 billion in 2007			1
total sales for organic food and non-food products in the @entity26 are expected to surpass $ 25 billion this year			1
however , one possible spanner in the works for the organic sector could be the results of a new study by the @entity41 which revealed that organic foods contained no more nutrients than non-organic foods grown with the use of pesticides			1
researchers studied five different crops -- carrots , kale , mature peas , apples and potatoes -- which were cultivated both organically ( without pesticides ) and conventionally ( with the use of pesticides ) and found that there was no higher level of trace elements in the food grown organically			0
study leader dr @entity58 said : " no systematic differences between cultivation systems representing organic and conventional production methods were found across the five crops so the study does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements than conventionally grown foodstuffs			0
" this study -- published in the latest edition of the @entity70 's ( @entity70 ) " @entity71 " -- is the first to assess the nutritional value of organic fruit and vegetables			0
it should be noted that the study does not make conclusions about the comparative levels of pesticides or chemicals in conventionally and organically grown food or the health effects of consuming such chemicals			0
the study results could be seen to support the idea that shopping organically is a lifestyle choice			0
when the idea of organics being a lifestyle choice was floated in 2007 by then @entity15 environment secretary @entity91 it drew fierce reaction from proponents of organic food , including the @entity14 , which represents organic producers			0
he told the @entity15 's @entity97 newspaper in january 2007 that organic food represented a lifestyle choice consumers could make and suggested that the use of chemicals and pesticides in non-organic foods did n't necessarily mean they were of inferior quality			2
so if organic foods are n't necessarily more nutritional , are they better for the environment ? according to the @entity107 , traditional agriculture accounts for around 11 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year , and the nitrous oxide found in fertilizers contributes most to these emissions			1
even still , in 2006 the @entity15 's @entity113 assessed the environmental impacts of food production and consumption and concluded that there is n't a clear cut answer to whether the environmental impact is greater on a trolley full of organic food compared to a trolley full of non-organic food			0
not so , was the response from the @entity14			0
do you believe organic food is more nutritional ? it countered that : " overall , organic farming is better for tackling climate change than industrial agricultural methods			1
as well as lower average energy use , organic farming also avoids the very large nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer manufacture			1
" " additionally , organic farming builds up soil carbon , removing it from the atmosphere			1
organic farming also supports more local food marketing , reducing food miles			1
" while the jury might still be out about whether organic farming is , on the whole , better for the environment , there is little doubt that it 's a booming industry which is starting to catch on in other parts of the world			2
the @entity150 's @entity149 estimates that organic farming now accounts for around 4.1 million hectares in @entity153 countries like @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			1
in @entity154 where the @entity158 in the 1940s helped transform it into an agricultural hub , organic farming is slowly expanding in specialist areas like tea and spices			1
perhaps an indication of the potential of the organics market there is that the @entity168 is looking to expand his organic food business to the sub-continent by the end of 2008			1
with a mandate of sustainability , @entity172 ( @entity173 ) in @entity154 developed an organic farm in the small village of @entity178 in @entity179 in 2002			2
here , local farmers are given the know - how and technical skills to develop their own organic enterprises			0
" local farmers are involved in cultivating oregano , parsley , thyme , peppermint , rosemary , rose geranium , artimisia , stevia , lemon grass , and several other herbal and medicinal plants , " @entity173 's @entity183 told @entity1			0
the herbs are commercially available to hotels and restaurants in the area and @entity199 executive chef @entity198 was so impressed with the quality , he 's authored an organic cookbook which makes use of the herbs			0
chef @entity198 told @entity1 that organic fruit and vegetables only make up around 14,000 tons of the two million tons of food produced by @entity154 's agricultural industry , but that measures like the " @entity209 " would help with wider awareness			2
" our approach is two pronged ; firstly we are trying to build awareness about organic farming which is in its infancy in @entity154 and secondly we are trying to build awareness within the culinary industry in @entity154			1
" @entity198 is sold on the superior taste , color and texture of the organic foods he uses in his kitchen , and he says the response from diners has been overwhelming			2
" the response has been very positive ; they are overwhelmed that we are going so close to nature and that their food is fresh from the farmland to the table			0
" with increased consumer awareness perhaps it wo n't be long before the choice between the organic and non-organic apples will be played out in markets across @entity154 .			0

new study finds organic foods are not necessarily more nutritious
the organics market in @entity26 to exceed $ 25 billion in sales this year
organic farming is becoming more *popular* in countries like @entity154
