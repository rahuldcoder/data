-- watching the @entity1 , which kick off in earnest friday with the opening ceremony in @entity3 , is more fun when you know the stories behind the @entity7			1
no doubt , sports broadcasters will hammer on plenty of rags - to - riches , against - the - odds backstories about the @entity1 athletes			1
( you can also find plenty of them on @entity0 's @entity1 page )			2
and that 's all good			0
but knowing the technological underpinnings of the @entity7 is perhaps just as intriguing			0
here 's a quick look at 10 of the most interesting tech stories to watch at the @entity1 : robotic cameras : @entity23 will install robotic cameras at a few locations at the @entity7			1
they can be controlled remotely and swivel 360 degrees			0
" the biggest help will come from cameras stashed in floodlights , rafters and scaffolding in and around @entity1 venues to provide imagery from places inaccessible to human photographers due to space or security reasons , " @entity27 wrote			2
in a @entity40 video about new photo tech , @entity38 says it will shoot some of the @entity1 in @entity43 souped - up sound : if you like to believe in the @entity46 , do n't read the next sentence : much of the sound you hear on tv during the @entity1 is n't real -- well , at least in the sense that some of it was n't recorded during the event being shown			1
some of the audio is recorded in advance , in optimized conditions , and then superimposed on the tv broadcast , writes the @entity57			0
the site gives the example of archery , which an @entity1 audio engineer says is based on the sound he heard watching " @entity62			2
" he captured it by putting a special mic on the ground between the archer and target , which , as @entity69 points out , creates a sound no person could actually experience at the event			0
two - part track : look , @entity75 , no spikes ! a new surface on the @entity1 track in @entity3 means runners wo n't have to wear spiked shoes			1
" unlike other track designs that combine traction and shock - absorption in an upper layer of rubber granules , the @entity83 track separates these functions , with a cushion backing for shock absorption and a solid upper layer that optimizes slip resistance , traction and durability , " the @entity81 writes			0
" this design cuts the need for the spikes on athletes ' running shoes to penetrate the running surface			0
" prosthetics : called " @entity104 " and " the fastest man with no legs , " @entity103 will be the first person to compete in the able - bodied olympics using prosthetic legs			0
after some controversy about whether prosthetics should be allowed in the @entity1 , @entity103 will run the 400 meters and the 4x400 meter relay on specially made carbon - fiber prosthetics			1
data - head athletes : some people are calling this the " @entity117			1
" others say it 's the " @entity120			0
" many athletes are using sleep - tracking devices and motion - capture systems to understand , with a new level of precision , how their bodies work			1
according to the @entity128 , some biometric device companies are trading athletes their participation for data that they can use to improve their body - tracking gadgets			1
virtual cycling : @entity135 cyclists have been training on @entity3 's cycling course even thought it 's thousands of miles away by using virtual reality			1
as the @entity135 @entity140 notes in a video package about the technology , the cyclists watch a screen that looks like a video game but actually is a " mile for mile , hill for hill recreation of the @entity1 road cycling course			1
" @entity150 treadmill : @entity152 runner @entity151 , meanwhile , has been training for @entity3 with a treadmill that simulates weightlessness			2
the @entity157 treadmill uses anti-gravity technology developed by @entity150 to give runners the feeling that they are only 20 % of their actual weight , the company says			0
in an interview posted on the company 's website , @entity151 said the treadmill helped her start running much more quickly after a stress fracture			0
low - tech suits : we tend to think of the @entity1 becoming higher - tech over time , but new technologies of course bring controversy and questions about how much help athletes should receive from space - age materials and equipment			1
high - tech @entity178 swimsuits , called @entity180 , are credited with helping swimmers shatter world records in 2008			1
but they will be banned at the @entity1 , leading to questions about how fast swimmers will go without this technological aid			2
at a news conference , @entity187 , who won eight gold medals in @entity189 , said that records will fall in @entity3 even without the tech. " if somebody wants a record , it 's going to be broken			2
" @entity195 blocks : @entity196 , the official timekeeper of the games , is debuting new starting equipment for swimming and track - and - field events in @entity3			1
the track starting blocks will be fully electronic for the first time			0
previously , 1970s technology required athletes to push back the blocks 5 millimeters to register a start , according to @entity209			2
the swimming starting blocks now will light up to indicate who placed first , second and third			0
jump - kick sensors : @entity215 has been at risk for being eliminated from the @entity1 , but technology that registers the strength and accuracy of kicks may save the sport			1
" i think taekwondo will really benefit from the technology because it will ensure the medals go to the best athletes , not to someone else because of a mistake from a referee or a judge , " @entity223 president @entity222 told @entity224			2
" this is a wonderful opportunity for us to remain in the @entity1			0
not many sports have this kind of technology			0
... it will help eliminate human error in taekwondo			0

technology is a controversial and *exciting* aspect of the @entity1
high - tech swimsuits were banned from the @entity3 games
some athletes use data tracking devices to optimize *performance*
