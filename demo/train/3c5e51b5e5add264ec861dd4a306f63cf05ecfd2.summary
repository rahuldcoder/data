@entity0 -- broadcast television networks won an important constitutional fight thursday when the @entity4 said government regulators imposed unfair punishment for isolated profanity and sexual content during evening " prime time " hours			1
in an 8 - 0 vote , justices concluded the @entity12 can not enforce its current policies against " fleeting " expletives and nudity on over-the - air programs , both live and scripted			1
the agency had levied hefty fines on all four major broadcasters beginning nearly a decade ago			0
the court 's ruling was narrow , as the justices declined to address whether the regulations violate free - speech protections guaranteed under the @entity25			1
but it does establish important guidelines the government must follow when monitoring explicit content on the airwaves			0
" the commission failed to give @entity34 or @entity35 fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent , " justice @entity31 wrote for the majority			1
the @entity41 had filed an appeal , and helpfully provided the justices with a dvd of a 2003 episode of the now - canceled " @entity46 " on @entity35 in which a naked woman was shown			0
the content of that program is central to the current legal dispute			0
@entity35 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity34 are all parties in the case			0
a federal appeals court last year for a second time struck down the government policies , concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied			1
pending sanctions against the broadcasters were dismissed			0
controversial words and images have been aired at times in scripted and unscripted shows on all the major over-the - air networks in the past eight years , dating back to when the @entity12 began considering a stronger , no - tolerance policy			1
the policy became known as the @entity66 , for singer @entity69 's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on @entity52 , where he uttered the phrase " really , really , f --- ing brilliant			0
" the commission specifically cited celebrities @entity73 and @entity75 for potty - mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 @entity77 , which aired live on @entity34			2
@entity82 , in an apparent scripted moment said , " have you ever tried to get cow s -- t out of a @entity81 purse ? it 's not so f --- ing simple			0
" opinion : @entity12 should clear @entity86 from airwaves while concluding the broadcasters ' due process rights were violated when they were not given fair notice , the court did not foreclose future enforcement			1
" this opinion leaves the commission free to modify its current policy , " @entity31 wrote , " in light of its determination of the public interest and applicable legal requirements			2
and it leaves the courts free to review the current policy or any modified policy in light of its content and application			0
" justice @entity109 did not participate in the decision , since she had heard the case when serving on a federal appeals court in @entity113 , before joining her current job			1
a separate appeal involving singer @entity117 's " wardrobe malfunction " and brief partial nudity on national television is pending at the high court			1
the justices are likely to throw the case back to the lower courts , in light of thursday 's ruling			2
the @entity12 said it would begin to immediately implement the policy			1
" as a matter of good governance , it is now time for the @entity12 to get back to work so that we can process the backlog of pending indecency complaints -- which currently stands at just under 1.5 million involving about 9,700 tv broadcasts , " said commissioner @entity127 , " some of these complaints date back to 2003			1
we owe it to the @entity139 public and the broadcast licensees involved to carry out our statutory duties with all deliberate speed			0
" there was no immediate reaction from the broadcasters in the @entity34 and @entity35 cases			0
but a group opposing stricter government control over tv applauded the high court 's ruling			1
" today 's decision by the @entity4 re-emphasizes what we have been advocating all along : that parents , not the government , are the best arbiters of what their children should be watching on tv , " said @entity155 's executive director , @entity154			1
" in the one - third of @entity139 homes with children , parents have tools such as the v - chip and content ratings to help them make decisions about what their children watch based on the age of the child and their family 's tastes and values			0
" middle finger ' malfunction ' mars @entity177 halftime show the high court two years ago ruled in favor of the @entity12 on the issue of " fleeting expletives , " concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast tv networks airing isolated cases of profanity			1
the court , however , refused both at that time and now to decide whether the commission 's policy violates the @entity25 guarantee of free speech , ruling only on the agency 's enforcement power			1
the @entity41 , in this appeal , lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together , saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one			1
explicit language is heard with greater , albeit varying , frequency on cable television , the @entity204 , and satellite radio , which do not use public airwaves			0
but the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints of " indecent " language and images on broadcast television and radio , which is subject to greater regulation			2
that is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours , when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching			0
the commission formally reversed its policy in march 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal			2
in addition , a voluntary rating system is used by all television networks to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired			2
much of the enforcement debate centered around the @entity35 television stations fined $ 27,500 each for airing the " @entity46 " episode featuring a woman with her breasts and buttocks exposed			0
another source of contention is whether broadcast radio and the tv networks -- @entity35 , @entity51 , @entity34 , @entity52 , and the @entity238 -- should receive treatment differing from their satellite and cable cousins regarding content			2
most broadcast stations are part of the basic cable packages people buy , and just 10 % of the population receives its tv signals only through the airwaves			0
but the government countered that 69 million television sets are not connected to cable or satellite , and that broadcasting is the medium of choice for children			0
the @entity4 first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978 , when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian @entity260 on society 's taboo surrounding " seven dirty words			1
" the bit had received some radio airplay			0
the justices said " context " should be applied when deciding whether words or images are " indecent			2
" the major broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity , racy images or expletives , even after 10 p.m. , when some potentially vulgar words are permitted			1
@entity277 -- the parent company of @entity1 -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago			2
the company is part owner of the @entity238 broadcast network and operates several cable networks			0
the case is @entity12 v. @entity285 ( 10 - 1293 ) .			2

the @entity4 *blocks* @entity12 policies against " fleeting " expletives and nudity
the commission failed to give networks fair notice of punishment , the ruling says
a federal appeals court had concluded the policies were vague and inconsistently applied
