-- even before @entity2 and @entity3 kicked off at @entity4 on monday , there was ample intrigue			1
with @entity3 making no secret about its interest in @entity2 striker @entity9 , would the @entity6 start ? @entity9 , who @entity2 repeatedly insist is n't for sale despite the 27 - year - old putting in a transfer request at the end of last season , did make the starting 11 and played the full 90 minutes			1
@entity3 boss @entity16 , meanwhile , did n't start a recognized striker , leaving $ 78 million man @entity18 on the bench			2
he again omitted @entity3 's player of last season , creative midfielder @entity21			2
in the end , both teams maintained their unbeaten start to the young season thanks to a mostly dour 0 - 0 draw			1
in @entity29 ' first home game in charge since replacing @entity31 , the scoreless tie was the first in the league at @entity4 in four years			1
the pre-game hype thus made for more fun than the game itself and the post-game comments from both managers provided yet more entertainment			0
with reports of a club other than @entity42 making a late bid for @entity45 winger @entity44 , a smiling @entity46 did n't deny @entity2 was the team in question			2
" @entity2 will always be interested in the best players , " @entity29 told @entity48			1
" we 're always looking to try to improve the team and the owners have given me every opportunity to bring in whoever i want			0
" @entity16 did n't rule out @entity3 making a third bid for @entity9 , although he acknowledged the support the @entity56 international received from the crowd would make it difficult for him to leave			1
@entity9 's shift was full of commitment , particularly evidenced when he tracked back late to dispossess @entity62			2
he was arguably @entity2 's best player			2
" ( @entity2 fans ) supported him all the way so i think this is a real special club with special fans and i think probably now he decides he wants to stay , " @entity16 told @entity48			2
@entity3 went top of the standings with seven points through three games , having contested a game more than its rivals when the fixture against @entity76 was moved up due to the @entity79 ' upcoming @entity78 clash against @entity80			1
@entity2 , @entity3 and @entity81 are thought to be the title contenders this season and @entity81 was the first team to flinch when it lost 3 - 2 at newly promoted @entity84 on sunday			1
" i told the players before the game we want to win , we will play to win but if you do n't win , you do n't lose , " said @entity16			0
" i think the players understood this completely			0
" the first half monday never took off			0
if ever a game needed a goal , as the saying goes , this was it			0
@entity2 striker @entity95 struck the side netting and somehow teammate @entity97 escaped a yellow card from @entity99 when he hacked down @entity100			0
as the half drew to a close , @entity9 almost slipped in @entity103 but his pass was too heavy			0
@entity2 began the second half with more urgency and @entity107 -- who scored two goals in @entity2 's league opener last week versus @entity110 -- should have done better when @entity9 found him inside the box			1
@entity3 's no - striker formation failed to match the potency of the @entity116 national team and @entity18 entered in the 60th minute			1
@entity2 wanted a penalty when it felt @entity119 's shot struck @entity120 in the arm but @entity99 did n't budge			0
" i think that 's two in a week that @entity3 has had ... which have been good shouts , " @entity29 said , referring to an incident in the @entity76 game last week			1
@entity9 's rising shot in the 77th minute forced @entity126 into a diving save and from the ensuing corner , @entity107 mistimed his header			0
@entity3 was by this time happy with a point , further shown when @entity16 replaced @entity132 with not @entity21 but defensive midfielder @entity133			0
three points for @entity42 in @entity116 , @entity42 made it two wins from two league games to match @entity137 after beating @entity138 1 - 0 away			1
@entity139 , the @entity140 striker linked with @entity141 , accounted for the scoring with a 10th - minute goal			0
@entity42 could have added to its lead , but @entity145 hit the post and @entity147 was denied by keeper @entity148 .			0

@entity151 title contenders @entity2 and @entity3 draw 0 - 0
it was the first scoreless tie in a league game at @entity4 since 2009
@entity9 , linked with a move to @entity3 , played all 90 minutes for the @entity157
the game marked @entity29 ' first home game in charge since replacing @entity31
