-- when scores of disgruntled tunisians took to the streets in january to demand the ouster of their country 's president , actor @entity1 was watching from afar			1
based in the @entity9 , @entity10 , who is one of @entity13 's most famous actors , went through a roller - coaster of emotions as he watched the unfolding of the uprising that subsequently spurred the @entity17			1
" i was trying to keep in touch all the time and see what happens and follow the news and understand what 's happening , " remembers @entity1			2
" you go through everything , " he says			0
" @entity25 , frustration and then happy moments at the end so it was a difficult time but i think it was an amazing time and i think what 's happening now is quite amazing because you 've got the first free elections coming in october -- it 's a new page in the @entity13 history			2
" the months of civil unrest culminated in the collapse of the regime of @entity13 's president @entity36 who ruled the country for more than 20 years			1
today , the north @entity39 country is still dealing with the aftermath of the revolution but people remain optimistic that the move to democracy can still be achieved			0
@entity1 , who has set up a production company in @entity13 , believes the recent events will open up opportunities for artists in the country , giving them the freedom to express themselves without any restrictions			1
" before , if you write something that does n't suit the ideas of the dictatorship or the government then there 's no way you 're going to make it , " says @entity1 , a former football player and model			2
" now , at least we 've got the freedom to write stories that we want to tell -- the censorship is not there			0
i think this is a great opportunity for artists , whether singers or writers or filmmakers , just to go for it and use the opportunity into progressing the movie industry back home			0
" the talented actor is perhaps best - known for his part in big - budget romantic comedy " @entity86 2 , " in which he played the role of a charming host whose job was to look after the film 's four main characters on a trip to @entity85			1
" it was great fun , " says @entity1 about his part in the @entity89 movie			0
" i had some filming to do in @entity93 and then in @entity94 and it was a great experience -- just to be involved in such an iconic tv program and then a film , so i 'm very happy about having been part of that			0
" while @entity1 has been carving a successful path as an actor in the international stage -- his work also includes roles in " @entity104 " and " @entity105 " -- he 's maintained links with the region he 's from , getting the best of the two worlds			1
the much - traveled actor has appeared in several tv series across the @entity112 and @entity113 and also presented one of the biggest talent shows in the region -- " @entity114 " -- with an audience of about 20 million viewers per show			0
" i 'm lucky in a way that actually i can go back to @entity13 or in the @entity112 and do different roles in @entity124 or sometimes in @entity125 or in @entity123 , " says @entity1 who is fluent in four languages			1
" playing different parts and also being in @entity123 there 's a great opportunity to do different roles			0
" but long before wowing moviegoers , @entity1 pursued his teenage passion for football in @entity13 , going to school during the day and training in the evening			1
after spending three years in @entity125 , where he studied computer science and played football , @entity1 returned to @entity13 before relocating to the @entity9 to follow his dream of acting			1
but settling in his new environment was n't without challenges -- @entity1 , who at the time did n't speak the language , had to divide his time between studying hard and working part - time in restaurants and bars in @entity145 to support himself			2
" there were hard times but now when you look back they were very useful and actually you can learn from them and they make you who you are -- at the end , you ca n't have a life experience just with good things , the difficult times are also very useful for now and for the future , " says @entity1			0
passionate about his country , @entity1 says january 's revolution shows the world that @entity13 is not just a tourist destination but a place with long history and rich culture			1
" i 'm proud to be @entity13 and i 'm proud to what 's happening now in @entity13 and i 'm proud of the people who actually lost their lives so then people like me and others can have a better future , " he says			2
" i 'm very grateful to them , i think it 's a difficult time for other counties now -- @entity174 countries -- because they 're going through the same process but i think the reward at the end is so great			0
" i 'm positive about it and i think it 's an amazing time for the @entity174 world			0
