@entity0 -- a " top kill " method intended to stop the runaway flow of oil in the @entity7 will likely be tried early next week , @entity3 chief operating officer @entity2 said friday			1
in the procedure , thick , viscous fluid twice the density of water will be pumped at a high rate into the site of the leak to stop the flow so that it can then be sealed with cement , @entity2 said			1
" our best estimate is probably tuesday , " he said , noting that the operation has never been tried in such deep water			2
the timing for the " top kill " effort appears to be slipping : @entity3 managing director @entity25 said thursday night that the company would try the procedure this weekend			1
@entity2 offered no explanation for the discrepancy			0
" we 're working very , very hard with @entity3 on the timeline for the ' top kill , ' " said @entity31 adm. @entity30 , national incident commander			1
" that 's the ultimate near - term solution			0
" @entity35 announces oil spill commission @entity3 is working to assemble " a massive amount of equipment " at the site , @entity2 said , including three deep - water rigs , drilling rigs , sub-sea support vessels and up to 16 robotic submarines			1
" these operations are quite complex , and we wo n't start the job until all the equipment has been staged and all the equipment is in place , " he said			0
but no one expects the effort to solve all the problems associated with the spill			0
" we will not rest , even if they secure the flow , even if this ' top kill ' is completed successfully next week , " @entity31 rear adm. @entity54 said			1
" we have a long row to hoe " to ensure that the damage that has already occurred is mitigated			0
@entity60 expressed disappointment friday over @entity3 's efforts to clean up oil on the shores of @entity65 , @entity66			1
though boom and skimmers had been staged there , " the folks were hesitating in deploying that , " she said			0
asked to what degree it will be possible to clean oil from the marshes , @entity30 said that oil in the marshes is " the worst - case scenario for us to deal with in terms of recovery			1
" that 's because mechanical cleanup can do more harm than good , he said			0
" in some cases , burning may be an acceptable solution , " he said			2
any such decision would be made on the scene in consultation with representatives of the state and the parishes involved , he said			0
but officials had unqualified praise for the weather , which has been cooperating fully in recent days , leaving the seas dead calm			0
" these are ideal conditions for skimming , " @entity60 said , noting that the percentage skimmed has risen to at least 50 percent from the typical 10 percent			0
sub-sea dispersants are also being used , she said , " so we 're not seeing a lot of oil coming to the surface			2
" on thursday , the @entity107 ordered @entity3 to find a less toxic chemical to break up the oil than the one it has been using , @entity111			1
the chemical has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 @entity107 - approved dispersants , according to testimony at a congressional hearing wednesday			0
@entity3 has found no immediate replacement candidate , @entity2 said			1
" our analysis that we submitted to @entity107 last night said there were no other dispersants we could identify that were available and less toxic , " he said			0
@entity3 was to meet later friday with the @entity107 to discuss alternatives , he said			1
as the continuing spill enters its second month , debate and concern have focused on just how much oil is spewing from the broken riser a mile below the surface			2
a federal technical team comprising scientists from the federal government and academia has been charged with estimating the flow rate based on video and other data			0
the estimate will be peer - reviewed and " given rigorous oversight by the federal government and academia , " @entity60 said			2
that estimate is likely to be complete " sometime next week , " she said			2
@entity3 has estimated the flow at 5,000 barrels per day , but independent estimates have exceeded that by many times , and @entity2 acknowledged friday that the company 's estimate contains " a huge amount of uncertainty			1
" the 5,000 - barrel figure translates into 210,000 gallons per day			0
that 's 8,750 gallons per hour , 145.8 gallons per minute and 2.4 gallons per second			0
@entity2 said he flew over the region friday morning and saw no oil close to the coasts of @entity155 , @entity156 or @entity157			2
but oil has shown up in seven locations on shore so far , with no new sightings in the past day , according to @entity2			2
he said cleanup activities were going on in each location			0
other efforts to stanch the leak continue			2
drilling of the first of two relief wells has reached 8,950 feet , said @entity169 , regional director for the @entity7 of the @entity171 , and work on the other has begun			1
@entity174 rep. @entity173 , @entity66 , concerned about people who are working to clean up the spill , has asked the @entity177 to set up temporary health care centers along the @entity179 to serve volunteers and workers			1
@entity173 envisions such clinics as providing " medical checkups to people who have come in contact with the oil and assist [ ing ] in monitoring the health effects of the oil leak on south @entity190			1
" he sent the request wednesday to @entity193 secretary @entity192			0
there was no immediate response from the agency			0
track the @entity7 oil spill " many residents and volunteers are being exposed to hazardous materials on a daily basis , and some will have to travel hours to get treatment at the nearest health care facility			1
it is imperative that temporary health care clinics be established to provide basic health care services in this geographic area , " he said			1
he has also asked @entity192 to " appoint a health care coordinator to oversee and streamline the health care response			2
" @entity173 emphasized that @entity3 should be responsible for such health care services in his state			1
the energy giant was operating the oil rig that exploded and sank in april , triggering the spill			0
@entity216 : track the spill , share stories the spill began with an april 20 explosion and fire that sank the drill rig @entity221 two days later			0
eleven workers were lost with the rig , which was owned by drilling contractor @entity224 and hired by @entity3			1
the resulting slick now threatens the coastal marshes of southeastern @entity66 , where brown , syrupy oil made it past protective booms and into the wetlands near the mouth of the @entity231 on wednesday			1
@entity1 's @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
