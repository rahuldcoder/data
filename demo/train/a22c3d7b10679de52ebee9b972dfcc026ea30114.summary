-- thursday 's @entity3 ruling upholding president @entity5 's signature health care legislation effectively cements the cornerstone of his political legacy , observers said			1
" this would be in the first paragraph of @entity5 's summation of his presidency , " said @entity9 professor @entity8 , co-author of a 2010 book on the politics of health care			1
@entity5 : ruling on health care a victory for all @entity19 " i can not think of a policy by a @entity23 or @entity24 that 's going to have the kind of long - lasting impact on the lives of @entity19 in at least half a century , maybe going back to the @entity28 , " @entity8 said after thursday 's ruling			1
in a long - anticipated ruling , the court upheld the individual insurance mandate at the heart of the @entity33 , often called " @entity33			0
" the 5 - 4 ruling allows the government to move ahead with implementing the legislation , some key provisions of which wo n't take effect until 2014			0
and it advances a goal of universal health care that has eluded presidents dating back to @entity45 , historian @entity40 said			1
" that this has finally gotten through the @entity3 is the very historic accomplishment that all presidents wish for when they come into office , " @entity46 said			2
ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides that titanic clash over health care began shortly after @entity5 took office in 2009 , pledging to expand health coverage to the roughly 45 million @entity19 without it			1
it dominated @entity60 for nearly a year before he signed the bill in march 2010			2
conservatives complained that it would bust the federal budget and lead to worse health care , not better			1
many liberals , meanwhile , wanted @entity5 to fight for a @entity67 - style model or at least establish a public health insurance plan to compete with private companies			1
opponents railed against the bill for a variety of sins real and imagined , including a later - dropped " @entity75 kickback " aimed at securing support from @entity79 @entity78 sen. @entity77 and the false claims of " death panels " by critics such as @entity84 gov. @entity83 , who argued that the bill would lead to patients being denied critical care			2
lawmakers found themselves facing angry crowds at usually sleepy meetings with constituents during their summer recess			0
breaking down the court 's decision in the end , it passed over near - universal @entity24 opposition -- the sole @entity24 vote for it in either chamber was rep. @entity100 of @entity101 -- with nearly three dozen @entity78 voting against it as well			2
the battle fueled the rise of the conservative tea party movement and contributed to a sweeping @entity24 win in the 2010 congressional elections			0
one of the politicians elected in that wave , @entity110 sen. @entity109 , called thursday 's decision " a loss for @entity19			2
" the @entity3 's finding that the individual mandate amounts to a tax will give taxpayers more headaches in april , @entity109 predicted			2
" this has now turned the @entity119 into an enforcement mechanism for @entity33 , " he said			0
how the justices voted , what they wrote @entity123 , the president of the @entity124 , urged followers to rally and " restore the @entity126 to its rightful place			0
" the group is a leading voice for religious conservatives and filed a friend - of - the - court brief attacking the law			0
" not only is the individual mandate a profound attack on our liberties , but it is only one section among hundreds of provisions in the law that will force taxpayers to fund abortions , violate their conscience rights and impose a massive tax and debt burden on @entity19 families , " @entity123 said			0
" it 's now time to replace those leaders who disregarded the constitutional limitations of their authority and the deeply held religious beliefs of their constituents , voting for the government takeover of health care			1
" @entity8 said the individual mandate -- the single biggest complaint about the legislation -- will affect " maybe two or three out of 100 @entity19			0
" it 's the rest of the law , particularly its regulations on insurance companies , that will have " a tremendous impact on the lives of everyday @entity19			0
" timeline of the health care law " it completely rewires health care delivery and financing , " he said			1
" we will think of this moment as before and after			0
" presidential historian @entity172 put the health care reform victory in the context of some of @entity5 's other signature moments , saying it is clear he 's made an impact in his first three and a half years in the @entity179			1
" i think president @entity5 is now in very good stead to say , ' i passed the @entity33 , i got @entity187 , and i saved @entity188 , " said @entity172 , referring also to the raid that killed the @entity182 leader and @entity5 's backing of the automobile industry bailout			1
" he has three real historic accomplishments			2
" of those , the health care law is by far the most controversial even after thursday 's decision			1
@entity46 said that while the battle over the law 's constitutionality is over , " i think the battle for public sentiment lays ahead			0
" before @entity199 managed to get @entity200 and @entity201 through @entity60 , future president @entity198 railed that " socialized medicine " would leave @entity19 " to spend their sunset years telling their children and their children 's children what it was like in @entity19 when men were free , " @entity46 noted			0
" that 's how deep that battle was at that period of time , and yet @entity200 has been sustained and it 's now approved , " she said , adding , " one thing we have not gotten and what i think the president has started doing is to make a clear understanding of what this bill is all about			0
" what the health care ruling means to you			1
