@entity1 , @entity0 -- there was a time when action heroes did n't contemplate			1
they defeated the bad guy and let their bodies do the talking for them			2
blast from the past : @entity13 plays himself in " jcvd			0
" action movies can still be a big draw at the box office -- " @entity20 " has grossed nearly $ 1 billion worldwide , according to @entity18 -- and action sequences have never been more intricate or thrilling			2
but audiences these days are demanding more of everything -- more adrenaline , more emotion , more complexity			1
the action movies today are a far cry from the ones that helped spur the rise of the genre in the 1980s , when hard bodies like @entity32 merely had to flex their muscles and utter monosyllables to generate a following			1
everything was more straightforward for the tough guys of yesteryear			2
@entity38 , @entity39 and @entity32 tackled problems with big guns , big muscles and big egos			0
there was a clear division between good and evil , and machismo conquered all			1
these days , the tough guy persona is giving way to more multifaceted characters			1
watching the hero beat up the bad guy is old hat ; understanding the source of his rage makes the action far more riveting			1
what do you want from an action hero ? tell us in the soundoff below			0
the most successful action film this year , " @entity20 , " is filled with dynamic characters ( @entity64 is hotly tipped to pick up a posthumous @entity65 for his portrayal as @entity67 ) and delves into the intricacies of everything from heroism to anarchy			0
the violence is rife , but it 's not meaningless			0
in other popular movies like " @entity75 " and the @entity76 , high - octane chase scenes are what get your pulse racing			1
but it is @entity80 's ( @entity81 ) battered emotional state that anchors " @entity84 's " story			0
for @entity85 , played by @entity86 , the quest to recover his memory and identity is what adds emotional depth -- and advances the story enough to keep it interesting over three films			1
in contrast , films like " @entity95 , " whose macho hero @entity96 harks back to the self - reliant tough guys of action flicks past , has been mostly panned for its weak story and mindless action			2
even action men of earlier decades are out to prove they are n't just fighting machines			2
@entity13 , the so - called " muscles from @entity106 " who made a name for himself in the 1980s with his killer martial arts moves , lets his guard down in the parody " jcvd , " due out in the @entity114 in february			0
@entity13 basically plays himself -- a downbeat actor dealing with the collapse of his family life -- and delivers a performance that entertainment trade publication variety said " constitutes the headiest stretch of the beefy star 's career since , well , ever			0
" @entity123 , another tough guy , earned a @entity125 nomination for playing a broken down fighter in " @entity127 , " and could be tipped for an @entity65 as the @entity125 are considered to be a harbinger of the @entity65			1
in a role that he says struck close to home , he plays a washed - up wrestler whose daughter wants nothing to do with him			0
aside from the hard bodies , action stars of today barely resemble their counterparts from decades earlier			0
audiences appear to want more than high - octane sequences from their action heroes , and that 's not a bad thing .			1

action heroes used to punch first and think about the *consequences* later
but these days good and evil are n't so clear cut and muscles do n't conquer all
it is the *psychology* *behing* a tough guy 's rage that keeps audiences *engaged* now
the " @entity85 " *trilogy* and " @entity75 " are *examples* of this trend
