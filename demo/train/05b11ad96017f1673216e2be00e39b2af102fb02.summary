-- in the wake of another round of national protests against police killings of unarmed black men , many @entity1 seem unable to identify with protesters or give credence to the goals of the # icantbreathe movement			1
i empathize with the vast majority of cops who keep the peace on our streets and enjoy majority support from their communities across the country			2
these protests are n't about them			0
these protests are about citizens ' rattled faith in the fair delivery of justice			2
in any civil society , there 's a serious problem when confidence in the rule of law is shaken			0
republicans who are committed to the stability of our society must acknowledge that these protests reflect real doubts in the equity of our criminal justice system			1
we all have a moral obligation to constantly improve it to the benefit of everyone			0
whether you agree that the decision not to indict former officer @entity43 in the shooting of @entity45 was correct ( as i do ) , or if you think the slogan " hands up do n't shoot " has been discredited because of witness testimony from the grand jury ( i do ) , @entity1 ought to accept that there 's a broader problem			1
look at the case of @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , or @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 , and at least a half dozen others			0
as a reform @entity1 who works for the @entity1 to broaden its base and reach new constituencies , i see no contradiction between supporting law enforcement and the policy solutions highlighted by these protestors			1
more republicans should champion the implementation of body - worn cameras on police officers , requested by @entity45 's family and supported by @entity1 law enforcement proponent @entity75			1
according to one study , body - worn cameras yielded a 50 % reduction in use - of - force incidents , and complaints against police officers dropped precipitously			0
we should be advocating these technologies to help protect the innocent and convict the guilty			0
consider that if @entity43 had worn a camera , there could be remarkably less dispute over the details of that tragedy			0
republicans should also champion " community policing " practices such as those employed by @entity93 , @entity94 , police chief @entity95 where creative engagement with community partners has reduced homicides by 50 % and violent crime by 20 %			1
pragmatic and nonpartisan solutions will increase confidence in law enforcement and support good police while offering more transparency and accountability to citizens who have lost confidence in the justice system			1
among the 2016 @entity1 presidential hopefuls , sen. @entity110 stands out on the issue of criminal justice reform because he 's consistently reached out beyond the base to communities of color			1
more republicans should follow his lead on policies ranging from reforming mandatory minimum sentencing and giving felons who have already served time the right to vote			2
on a recent saturday afternoon , i co-hosted an opinion panel on @entity0 with my friends @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			2
while we usually represent contrasting perspectives on the week 's top issues , we strive to disagree agreeably and forge common ground			0
that was the case this past weekend , when we jointly agreed to end the show with a salute to the ongoing # icantbreathe protests			1
the photo of us four raising our hands was celebrated on social media by creative icons such as @entity141 , who tweeted , " inspired to see @ @entity0 opinion voices speaking out on left and right , " and @entity144 , " glad to see diverse and bold voices on @ cnn			1
beautiful statement of support for humanity			0
" it was also condemned by conservatives who wondered why i , as a @entity1 , was supporting a discredited narrative			2
first of all , facts matter			0
i 've made my support for the grand jury 's nonincitement in the @entity157 case clear			0
but right or wrong , " hands up " has now fused with a larger movement -- bigger than @entity43 and @entity45			2
i believe we all have an obligation , especially @entity1 , to engage the debate and propose solutions for improving our criminal justice system			1
@entity0 is and always should be the place that breaks through left / right , black / white divides and forges common ground on contentious debates			2
that 's what we aspire to in our opinion panel			0
our common ground broke through the tired divisions that too often dominate cable tv debates -- it sparked attention for the right reasons			0
it should be the beginning of a refreshing conversation about how we can come together and improve our criminal justice system .			1
