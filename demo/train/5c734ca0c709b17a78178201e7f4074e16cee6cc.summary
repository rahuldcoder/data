@entity0 -- a federal judge dismissed manslaughter charges thursday against five @entity5 security guards in the 2007 deaths of @entity8 civilians in a @entity10 square , finding that prosecutors wrongly used the men 's own statements against them			1
the september 2007 shootout in @entity16 's @entity15 left 17 @entity8 dead and two dozen wounded			1
the killings led @entity8 's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by @entity5 , now known as @entity5 , and other firms			2
@entity27 district judge @entity26 found that the government 's case was built largely on " statements compelled under a threat of job loss in a subsequent criminal prosecution , " a violation of the fifth amendment rights of the five men charged			2
" in their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case , the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation , " @entity26 wrote in a 90 - page decision			1
federal prosecutors " repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced , senior prosecutors assigned to the case " in doing so , he found			2
@entity26 also sharply criticized prosecutors and federal agents who developed the case , calling their explanations for using the guards ' statements " all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility			1
" " in short , the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants ' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt , " he wrote			0
there was no immediate response to the decision from the @entity65 , which can appeal thursday 's ruling or seek new indictments against the men			1
the men were guarding a @entity70 convoy moving through western @entity16 when the shooting began			0
the company said its contractors came under attack , but @entity8 authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate			0
each of the now - former guards -- @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime			0
prosecutors requested that charges against @entity83 be dropped in november , but thursday 's ruling dismisses the counts against all five			1
" we 're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them , " said @entity79 's lawyer , @entity94			0
a sixth guard , @entity99 , pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .			0
