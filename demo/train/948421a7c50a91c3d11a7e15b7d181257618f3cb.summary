-- the biggest case of the @entity3 's term involves a three - headed , hot - button appeal combining abortion rights , religious liberty , and @entity7			1
it 's also the last one , and a ruling is due on monday			1
the legal and social pique may not reach the heights of two years ago when the justices narrowly preserved the @entity7 and its key funding provision in a blockbuster ruling			1
but the stakes are still large , and the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law championed by president @entity20 and in play as a campaign issue this midterm season			1
the issue before the justices is whether @entity7 can mandate contraception coverage specifically for certain businesses that object for religious reasons			1
" this case is n't that practically important , except for the employees and businesses involved			2
there just are n't a huge number of those , " said @entity30 , publisher of @entity31 and a @entity33 appellate attorney			0
" but everyone can agree the social questions presented -- about when people can follow their religious convictions , and when people are entitled to contraception care -- are truly important , " he said			2
hundreds of advocates and demonstrators representing both sides are expected to rally in front of the courthouse on @entity48			0
contraception mandate the section of law in dispute requires for - profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay			1
a number of companies equate some of the covered drugs , such as the so - called " morning - after " pill , as causing abortion			0
the specific question presented was whether these companies can refuse , on the sincere claim it would violate their owners ' long - established moral beliefs			0
the @entity69 says that " @entity70 shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof			2
" " how does a corporation exercise religion ? " asked justice @entity75 at march 's oral arguments , summarizing perhaps the key constitutional question at hand			0
" this is a religious question and it 's a moral question , " added justice @entity81 , suggesting the businesses have such a right			2
" you want us to provide a definitive secular answer			0
" @entity89 , @entity90 the justices have a good deal of discretion to frame the competing issues and could reach a limited " compromise " through narrow statutory interpretation			2
they could conclude individual owners can make the religious freedom claim , bypassing the corporate rights argument , but still give female workers the flexibility to get covered drugs			0
the court weighed two related appeals from @entity106 , a @entity108 cabinet maker , and @entity90 , an @entity109 - based retail giant that will have more than 700 arts - and - crafts stores nationwide by year 's end			0
both corporations emphasized their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace			0
that includes their leaders ' publicly stated opposition to abortion			0
the case presented a complex mix of legal , regulatory , and constitutional concerns over such thorny issues as faith , abortion , corporate power , executive agency discretion , and congressional intent			0
health law impact the political stakes are large , especially for the future effectiveness of the health law , which marks its fourth anniversary this year			1
the botched rollout last fall of @entity140 , the federal @entity7 website , has become another political flashpoint along with other issues that many @entity144 say proves the law is unworkable			1
they have made @entity7 a key campaign issue in their fight to overtake the @entity150 , and retain control of the @entity152			1
supporters of the law fear a high court setback on the contraception mandate will lead to other healthcare challenges on religion grounds , such as do - not - resuscitate orders and vaccine coverage			1
more broadly , many worry giving corporations religious freedom rights could affect laws on employment , safety , and civil rights			0
the abortion link the @entity171 family , owners of @entity89 , and the @entity174 family , owners of @entity90 , said some of the mandated contraception prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman 's womb , which the plaintiffs equate with abortion			2
that includes @entity184 contraception , which some have called the " morning after " pill , and intrauterine devices or @entity188 used by an estimated 2 million @entity190 women			2
a key issue for the bench has been be interpreting a 1993 federal law requiring the government to seek the " least burdensome " and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions			1
chief justice @entity198 could be the " swing " vote as he was two years ago when siding with the court 's more liberal members to allow the law 's " individual mandate " to go into effect			1
that provision requires most americans to get health insurance or pay a financial penalty			1
it is seen as the key funding mechanism to ensure near - universal health coverage			0
searching for compromise ? but how will the divided court rule this time ? unanimous opinions in recent days on separate issues involving presidential recess appointments , cellphone searches by police , and abortion clinic protests suggest @entity198 may be on a private campaign to push his colleagues to rule narrowly to reach consensus			2
such an approach usually involves both left - and right - leaning justices reluctantly giving a little			2
" at oral argument it seemed likely a majority of the justices were looking for a compromise , " said @entity30 , " in which the closely held for - profit businesses would n't themselves have to pay for contraception care , but the employees would get it , maybe through the exchanges , maybe financed by the federal government			1
" compromise may be nice , but as other contentious cases earlier this term demonstrated , it is not always easy to achieve			0
separate decisions this spring involving political campaign donations and voter - approved affirmative action limits produced especially sharp 5 - 4 divisions			0
under the @entity7 , financial penalties of up to $ 100 per day , per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage			1
@entity90 , which has about 13,000 workers , estimates the penalty could cost it $ 475 million a year			0
the church - state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated between the @entity20 administration and various outside groups			0
under the changes , churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate			1
other nonprofit , religiously affiliated groups , such as church - run hospitals , parochial schools and charities must either offer coverage or have a third - party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer 's direct involvement			1
lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts			0
second generation monday 's decision could signal how the court will approach other lawsuits against the health care law			0
" we 're now getting the second generation of challenges to @entity7 -- about the actual adoption of the statute , and its core provisions , " said @entity30			1
" we 're probably going to see cases over the next five to ten years , as more and more details about the law get put into effect			0
" a mennonite family 's fight over @entity7 reaches 5 questions : @entity3 and @entity7 on contraception opinion : how @entity7 can reduce abortions			1
