the @entity1 ocean , atmospheric and space agencies affirmed on friday what the planet has been telling us every way it knows how : 2014 was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880			1
that means average land and sea temperatures , worldwide , have never been hotter in modern times , according to the @entity13 ( the gold standard for global climate data ) and the @entity16 ( the guys who put a man on the moon )			1
this is n't about whether we believe in science : it 's about whether we believe the thermometer			2
in fact , the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1997 , the new data confirm , contributing to widening deserts , rising seas , withering drought , ravaging storms , blistering heat and other climate change impacts reaching from the tiniest @entity34 village to our own backyards			1
here in the @entity1 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 all wrapped up their hottest years on record			1
@entity40 remains mired in the grip of a three - year drought , its worst in centuries			1
the @entity46 is still rebuilding from @entity47			2
and that was just one of the climate - related disasters that cost this country an estimated $ 139 billion in damages in 2012 alone			2
above and beyond the economic costs , climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world			1
for example , @entity59 is expected to publish an encyclical on the state of the world 's environment , singling out climate change as an urgent challenge to global stewardship			1
it 's reported that he 'll call on people of all faiths to embrace our obligation to protect future generations from this grave and gathering scourge			2
president @entity76 has embarked on the single greatest @entity1 effort yet to combat this growing menace , by reducing the dangerous carbon pollution that 's driving climate chaos			1
he has directed the @entity81 to put in place the first limits on carbon pollution from the power plants that account for about 40 % of the @entity1 carbon footprint			0
under the president 's @entity88 , we 'll cut carbon emissions from our power plants 26 % by 2020 and 30 % by 2030			2
we can do better than that -- and we should			0
the president 's plan puts us on the right track			2
since last summer , @entity81 officials have been hard at work , coordinating with their state counterparts , public service commissions , power companies and other vested stakeholders to come up with tailor - made plans to hit the targets in the most cost - effective way			0
some power companies are already well on their way , investing in efficiency so we can do more with less waste , getting more power from the wind and sun , cleaning up dirty power plants or some combination of the three			0
even as we , as a nation , begin to make progress , though , some coal , gas and oil companies and their allies on @entity119 want to turn us back around			0
@entity123 leaders in the @entity124 have pledged to lead legislative efforts meant to keep the @entity81 from cutting carbon pollution			0
the @entity123 leaders are n't offering answers of their own , mind you ; they just want to block any action that could help us address the problem of climate change			1
it 's part of the big polluter agenda they 've vowed to press , putting fossil fuel profits first -- and putting the rest of us at risk			0
we have a responsibility in this country to stand up and speak out for what matters most			0
that 's the essence of @entity1 democracy			0
it 's part of what makes us exceptional			0
it 's part of what makes us great			0
we just finished , worldwide , the hottest year on record			1
those are facts no amount of climate change denial can alter			1
we have a choice in this country			0
we can continue to feed climate disaster by anchoring our future in the fossil fuels of the past , or we can protect future generations from the ravages of climate change by investing in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow .			1

2014 was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880
high temperatures have resulted in widening deserts , rising seas , droughts , ravaging storms , blistering heat
while president @entity76 is trying to tackle climate change , *republicans* are blocking meaningful actions
