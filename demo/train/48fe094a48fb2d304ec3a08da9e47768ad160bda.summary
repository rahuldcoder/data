-- i recently met a woman , the mother of three black teenagers			2
she told me that after the @entity5 shooting , she forbade her boys to wear hoodies			1
she warned them never to walk around with their hands in their pockets			2
she was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed			2
this is one hell of a thing to be afraid of			2
i do n't think parents of white kids ever really feel this terror -- not in this way			1
i defended the man who shot @entity5 , and i believe that the verdict the jury returned was correct and just			2
but based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years , i know her fears are not without foundation			2
the shooting of @entity30 -- an unarmed 18 - year - old @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 -- reinforces her fears , and it gives me a dull , empty feeling in my gut			1
we 're hearing conflicting stories about how the @entity30 shooting happened			1
some witnesses say the teenager had his hands up in surrender when an officer opened fire on him			0
the @entity32 police chief says the officer was attacked in his cruiser , and the first shot was fired inside the car			0
it 's possible both accounts are true , but we do n't know			1
here 's what we do know : a police officer and a black man interacted , multiple shots were fired , and @entity30 was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him			1
soon we should know how many times the officer shot @entity30 , from how far and from what direction			1
these factors will be critically important in determining whether the shooting was justified or not			1
black or white , an officer must be in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm before using deadly force , just like the rest of us			1
what we know about @entity30 's shooting if @entity30 was shot from far away , or if he was shot in the back , it would provide strong evidence that he was retreating -- that the officer was not in imminent fear -- and that the shooting was not justified			1
what we must acknowledge is that we do n't yet know enough to be convinced one way or the other			1
now there are cries of " no justice , no peace " as evening vigils turn violent , with rioting and looting			0
" justice , " it seems in this context , can only be found if the officer is convicted of murder			0
if facts show the shooting to be justifiable , it will not be seen as justice by those making the demands			1
whether my client is black , white , @entity100 or something else , here is how i want justice defined : two sides , well - represented , present their cases in an adversarial system ; the law is followed and a just result is inevitable			2
@entity30 's case will have the added benefit that it will be tried in the ever - watchful view of intense public scrutiny			1
citing death threats , police wo n't identify officer in @entity30 shooting for many in the black community the reality of the criminal justice system does n't measure up to the ideal			1
many believe that the criminal justice system , from first police interaction to verdict , is infected with a racial bias that taints the possibility of justice as it should be defined			1
i have long argued in court that such a bias exists ; that probable cause did n't exist for this car stop ; that hanging on a street corner or sitting on a stoop is not loitering ; that " attitude " is not resisting without violence			1
while the bias does exist , it 's not simply a black and white issue			2
it 's rare to find an overtly racist cop , or an overtly racist judge			0
the bias is nuanced ; it 's woven into the system , and it builds with each interaction with the system until , at last , it results in unequal justice			2
consider the very first interactions : a cop and young black male interact on the street , and both give the other a bit of attitude			0
the officer gives some attitude because he 's tired of getting attitude from other young men , and the young man gives some attitude because he 's tired of getting attitude from other cops			0
now , who 's at fault ? this , as simple as it sounds , is how it starts			0
once the infection begins , it grows quickly			0
if you want to say the cop 's at fault because he 's the adult with training , you are right			0
and if you want to say the young man is at fault for disrespect or mistrust of a cop 's authority , you are right			0
@entity33 teen shot by police was two days away from starting college if both sides refuse to move toward the middle , we will all just keep going down this path , and another black family will plan another funeral			0
or we can agree that we , each of us , will be better off accepting responsibility for an infection that we can not defeat individually			0
who makes the first step ? the police must			0
many police agencies have community outreach programs that are successful			0
police officers are in the position of authority , and they have the power to send a message that when they serve a community , they serve all the people of the community equally , regardless of race			0
to break this cycle , police must recognize there is bias in the system , and they make an effort to treat the people they serve with respect			1
in return , we must recognize the risks law enforcement officers take to protect our communities			0
we must respect their authority			0
and we must understand the grave reality that the way we engage a police officer can affect whether we walk away , whether we are driven away in handcuffs , or whether we are taken away on a stretcher			0
this is true for people of every race , from every community -- and unfortunately , with the current bias , it may more true for some of us than for others			2
for those who say that talking about this now is an insensitive way to blame @entity30 for his own death , nothing could be further from the truth			1
no matter what turns out to have happened that saturday afternoon , @entity30 was killed by the infection , by this insidious cycle			1
let 's see what we can accomplish if we focus on breaking that cycle .			0
