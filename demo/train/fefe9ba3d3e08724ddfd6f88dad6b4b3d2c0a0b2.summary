-- @entity1 thrilled his home crowd in july when he became the first @entity4 man in 77 years to win the wimbledon singles title			2
but @entity1 will most likely miss the second highest profile tennis event in @entity4 -- the year - end championships in november -- after choosing to undergo surgery for a lingering back injury			1
the 26 - year - old @entity10 has had back issues in spurts throughout his career and was forced to pull out of the @entity14 in may prior to his historic fortnight at the @entity16			1
his withdrawal in @entity18 marked the first time since the 2007 clay - court tournament in @entity21 that @entity1 had skipped one of tennis ' four majors			0
that year , he hurt his wrist			0
@entity1 exited earlier than expected at two @entity27 warm - up tournaments and was then upset by @entity28 in straight sets in the quarterfinals in @entity31 this month as the defending champion			1
" next week , @entity1 is set to undergo minor back surgery in an effort to clear up a longstanding back problem , " @entity1 's management team said in a statement sent to @entity0			1
" the issue flared up again during the @entity39 this year when @entity1 was forced to retire and he sought advice from a range of specialists in may			0
" after a successful return on the more forgiving grass courts , @entity1 enjoyed success at @entity46 's and @entity47 , but after recently playing on hard courts and clay , @entity1 once again sought medical advice about solving the issue once and for all			2
" the aim is to be fully fit for the new season			0
" @entity1 thus becomes the second member of the so - called ' @entity56 ' to miss a chunk of the 2013 schedule -- @entity59 did n't play at the @entity60 in january as he continued to recover from his knee troubles			1
and 17 - time grand slam winner @entity62 has dealt with his own back problems , not playing at the @entity65 in @entity66 during the @entity67			0
@entity1 can take heart from @entity59 's performances after the @entity70 returned to the tour			0
@entity59 claimed the @entity14 and captured his 13th major at the @entity27 by downing @entity73 .			2

@entity1 will undergo minor back surgery and most likely miss the rest of 2013
@entity1 missed the @entity14 with a back problem before winning @entity47
he lost early in two @entity27 warm - up events and was upset in @entity31 by @entity28
