@entity0 -- house speaker @entity2 blasted president @entity3 on thursday for saying no @entity5 combat troops would be placed on the ground in the fight against @entity8 in @entity9			1
" an f - 16 is not a strategy			0
airstrikes alone will not accomplish what we 're trying to accomplish , " @entity2 told reporters in his weekly media briefing			2
" the president has made clear that he does n't want @entity5 boots on the ground			0
well , somebody 's boots have to be on the ground , " he continued			0
" and so i do believe that what the president has asked for , as the commander in chief , he has this authority to train the @entity9 rebels , and frankly we ought to give the president what he 's asking for			1
" @entity3 announced wednesday night that his plan includes airstrikes in @entity9 , as well as training moderate @entity9 rebels who are also trying to combat the militant group			1
the latter action requires specific congressional approval , and @entity2 said he supports giving the president that authorization			2
still , he blasted @entity3 's decision to draw a line on putting @entity5 troops on the ground			1
" i would never tell the enemy what i was willing to do or unwilling to do , " @entity2 said			0
@entity44 has not passed any authorization			0
and while @entity2 said it would be in the nation 's interest to vote , he punted to the @entity49 , complaining it had not presented @entity44 with the language for a resolution			1
pressed by @entity1 's @entity53 on why @entity44 would n't just write its own language , @entity2 reiterated that the @entity49 has typically taken that initiative			1
" that 's not how this has happened , " he said			0
" the president would make that request and the president would supply the language for the resolution			0
" while he said he would support the authorization , he still remained skeptical of the president 's mission			2
" i 'm not sure that we 're doing all that we can do to defeat this terrorist threat , " he said			0
" if our goal is to eliminate @entity8 , there 's a lot of doubt whether the plan that was outlined by the president last night is enough to accomplish that mission			1
" @entity75 : @entity5 not at war with @entity8 @entity78 candidates finding distance from @entity3 on @entity8			2

house speaker @entity2 says the president 's @entity8 plan is not enough
@entity3 's plan includes airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity9 and training some @entity9 rebels
