-- the @entity2 @entity1 rejected a request thursday to temporarily stay the execution of death row inmate @entity5 , who is set to die before a @entity7 firing squad early friday			1
the @entity1 's rejection ended the last legal maneuver for @entity5 , 49 , who is scheduled to face execution shortly after midnight friday ( 2 a.m. et ) for the shooting death of attorney @entity12 during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a @entity16 , @entity7 , courthouse			1
he would be only the third person to die by firing squad in the @entity2 in 33 years			1
@entity7 gov. @entity19 rejected two appeals by @entity5 's attorneys to stop the execution , saying @entity5 had every chance to present his case			1
" upon careful review , there is nothing in the materials provided this morning that has not already been considered and decided by the @entity32 or numerous courts , " @entity19 wrote in a letter to the attorneys rejecting the first appeal			2
" mr. @entity5 has had a full and fair opportunity to have his case considered by numerous tribunals			1
" among the claims @entity5 raised in his appeals is that he has been a death row inmate too long			1
" he asserts that executing him now , after nearly 25 years on death row in @entity7 , so lacks retributive or deterrent value that it violates the @entity44 , " @entity39 , @entity5 's lawyer , told the high court			2
he did not return phone calls from @entity0 seeking comment			0
a federal judge late tuesday refused to block the execution , after @entity5 claimed the procedures related to a two - day commutation hearing held by the state @entity32 last week violated his civil rights			1
the parole board monday refused to commute @entity5 's sentence to life in prison , and the @entity57 on tuesday also denied his request for a stay			1
@entity5 testified before the board he is a changed man , and his sentence should be commuted			2
that was the issue before the 10th @entity63 in @entity64 , which concluded the clemency hearings were conducted fairly and did not violate the inmate 's civil rights			0
" there is no merit to the claims asserted in the underlying [ civil rights claim ] challenging the procedures followed in mr. @entity5 's state clemency proceeding , " wrote the three - judge panel			2
" in light of that fundamental deficiency , mr. @entity5 's associated application for a stay of his execution was also meritless			1
" he is set to become the third person to die by rifle fire , all in @entity7 , since the @entity1 restored the death penalty in 1976			2
he had a long history of escapes and was slipped a gun before he fatally shot @entity12 on april 2 , 1985			0
he was at the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing in the 1984 slaying of @entity89 , who was killed at the @entity16 bar where he was working to earn extra money			0
the execution will be held at the @entity93 in @entity94 , about 20 miles south of @entity16			0
corrections officials announced @entity5 had consumed his last meal tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. , and has elected to fast prior to the anticipated execution			1
his dinner included steak , lobster , @entity101 , apple pie and vanilla ice cream			0
as he awaited execution , @entity5 watched the " @entity109 " trilogy in an observational cell and read a novel by @entity108 entitled " @entity108 , " said @entity111 spokesman @entity110			1
in the hours before the scheduled execution , @entity5 met with a bishop from the @entity114 , @entity110 said			1
during the commutation hearing , parole board members heard testimony regarding @entity5 's childhood , which was punctuated by poverty , abuse and neglect			2
@entity39 maintained that jurors in the @entity12 trial never heard this evidence -- and presented affidavits from jurors who said it might have persuaded them to decide against the death penalty			0
life in prison without the possibility of parole was not an option for jurors at the time , and @entity39 said it was suggested to the jury that @entity5 might be released from prison at some point if he were given a life sentence			2
@entity5 pleaded guilty to second - degree murder in @entity89 's death , and jurors were not told of a judge 's recommendation in that case that he not be released from prison , @entity39 said			2
@entity7 is the only state that uses the firing squad as a current execution method			1
@entity146 allows it only if lethal injection and electrocution are ruled unconstitutional			0
forty of @entity7 's 49 executions in the last 160 years or so have been done this way , according to the @entity152			0
state lawmakers made lethal injection the default capital punishment in 2004 , but at least three inmates who already had chosen the firing squad were grandfathered in under the new law			1
five anonymous marksmen will use matching .30 - caliber rifles , standing behind a wall cut with five gunports			0
one of the rifles will be an " ineffective " round , similar to a blank , which delivers the same recoil as a live round			0
that ensures none of the riflemen will know who delivered the fatal shot			0
the marksmen fire from a distance of 25 feet			0
the inmate is blindfolded , strapped to a chair and a target pinned to his chest			0
@entity0 's @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
