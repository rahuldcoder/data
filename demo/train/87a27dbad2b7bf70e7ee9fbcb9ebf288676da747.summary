-- @entity1 had spent 20 years teaching negotiation skills to top executives when he realized those techniques might be just as valuable to soldiers on the battlefield			1
so a decade ago , he approached the @entity7 to teach officers negotiation tools and strategies they could use in a theater of war			1
the @entity13 was founded , and before long , @entity1 made another realization : the lessons could go the other way , too			1
" there 's a ton to take from the military back to the corporations , " says @entity1 , a partner at @entity17 , a @entity19 - based negotiation training and consulting firm that works with @entity22 companies			1
" business leaders have a lot to learn from military leaders who , in extreme situations , are able to take a deep breath , get perspective and negotiate through a set of strategies			1
" read more : why we pick bad leaders perhaps counter-intuitively , the best military negotiators adopt a creative , problem - solving approach			1
a more macho , " @entity41 style " of negotiation -- in which the negotiator digs in inflexibly to a position they believe to be right -- is " just not effective , " @entity1 says , and could lead to fatal errors			1
" when we 're under pressure to act fast in a high - stakes situation , it often leads us to a set of traps , " he adds			2
" we often act on perception and assumptions , we tend to use a strong position and dig in , we tend to use threats and we play a concessions game far too frequently			0
" below are five key points into which @entity1 has distilled the essence of successful deal - making , which he says are equally applicable whether you 're dealing with potentially hostile stakeholders on the battlefield , or a fellow boardroom warrior			1
know your enemy step back and solicit the perspective of the other side			0
understanding their point of view , whether you agree with it or not , is crucial to ensuring you have an accurate handle on the situation			0
this way you avoid becoming locked into a false set of assumptions , or confusing it with a situation you have seen before			0
creativity , not compromise be disciplined about uncovering underlying motivations -- then use those motivations to put forward a set of possible creative solutions			2
says @entity1 : " the most effective negotiators dig for interests or motivations underneath the stated demand , and present possibilities in response			1
" be creative and look for the other side to build those possible solutions with you			2
" with a little creativity you can do all kinds of great stuff , without needing to compromise			0
" read more : want to be a leader ? act like one arm yourself ... and the other side be principled and fair			0
" you need to take responsibility for arming yourself and the other side with something objective to defend the solution with , " says @entity1			1
" if you leave the other side telling their people , ' well , i agreed to this because the other side pushed really hard , made a threat and coerced me , ' chances are they 're not going to persuade their stakeholders and critics			0
" win hearts and minds tackle issues of mistrust head on , and do n't mix them with the substance of the negotiations			0
" often we find people try to buy a damaged relationship : ' you do n't think i 'm a good partner , i 'll throw some money at this			0
' that never works , " says @entity1			1
" you might make someone temporarily happy , but you do n't build trust that way , and without trust it 's very difficult to do complex deals			0
" he advocates negotiating on " two tracks " : trust and relationship issues on one side , the substance of the negotiations on the other			2
take control be active and deliberate about shaping the negotiation process in the way you want it to evolve , proposing new ways forward when talks stall			2
systematically change the game if you do n't like the way the other side is playing it			0
do n't simply fall back to a position of reacting to their demands			0
this creative approach requires a major shift in perspective for macho corporates , many of whom tend to take the attitude that their " strength comes from being right , " says @entity1			1
he says many tend to negotiate " the same way they handled their first negotiation -- they wanted food , they cried , they did n't get it , they cried harder			2
unfortunately that 's many people 's first and last lesson in negotiation			2
" but while the military 's finest negotiating talent may have generated these solutions , it does n't necessarily follow that they are used more prevalently in the military than in the corporate world			1
" we 're getting there in the military			0
but , " he concedes , " in large part , it still has a fairly macho approach			1
" perhaps not unlike the boardroom .			0

@entity1 says the strategies of top military negotiators work well in the corporate world
