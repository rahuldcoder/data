-- as a young freedom fighter , @entity1 stepped out of a farmhouse hideout in @entity4 , took 20 strides and dug a hole on the sprawling land			0
he leaned over , put in a semiautomatic pistol and 200 rounds of ammunition , and carefully put a khaki uniform over them			1
after covering them with heaps of soil , he sauntered back into his rural hideout in northern @entity17 -- hoping to retrieve them soon			0
he never got a chance to fire a shot with the @entity22 pistol			1
a few weeks after he buried it at the farm in @entity25 , he was hurled into prison for the next 27 years			1
that was in 1962 , and the whereabouts of the gun -- now estimated at $ 3 million -- remain a mystery , said @entity31 , the chief executive of @entity32 , the former hideout now converted into a museum			1
a scramble to find the gun has sparked a frenzy among collectors , historians and @entity1 fans			2
' it 's interesting how we came to find out about the gun , " @entity31 said			1
" @entity1 visited @entity45 in 2003 , and as we were walking around , he turned to me and asked , ' by the way , did you find my gun ? " @entity31 said he was stunned			2
" i turned to him and said , ' gun , what gun ? ' " @entity1 then asked him to pinpoint where the main kitchen once stood			1
" he then made a 45 - degree angle and said , ' 20 paces from here , i buried a gun , ' " @entity31 said			2
during the visit , the two tried to retrace his steps using the paces as a guide , but the farm had undergone some changes , making it hard to determine the original location of the kitchen with certainty			2
@entity31 later realized that the former @entity4 president had talked about the gun during an interview with a journalist in the 1990s right after he was freed from prison			1
during the interview , @entity1 indicated that he buried the pistol , ammunition and the uniform at the site in case there was a raid at the house , according to @entity31			2
@entity1 and the military wing of the @entity82 used the secret location -- now @entity32 -- to plan the toppling of the @entity4 apartheid government			1
it is the first gun @entity1 owned and the first weapon linked to the anti-apartheid fight in @entity4 , @entity31 said			2
the gun was a gift by @entity92 col. general @entity91 , whom @entity1 visited in the early 1960s for military advice on fighting apartheid			1
despite its hefty price tag , @entity31 hastily makes it clear that it 's not about the money or glorifying violence			2
" it is all about the historical significance of the gun and who it belongs to , " @entity31 said			0
" the 1960s were a defining moment in @entity4 's struggle ... the gun has a special link to a very significant period and epoch to our liberation struggle			1
" a scramble to find the gun has prompted @entity31 to take extreme measures			0
he hired searchers to demolish a home on @entity121 's property , carefully ripping up chunks of concrete and turning over a yard to find it			0
he also dispatched military experts to try and pinpoint its exact location based on @entity1 's information			1
his trust owns about five acres of the original 20 - acre hideout			0
" the expert identified three possible locations , two of which are on our site , " @entity31 said			0
the third location is on neighboring property , which was put up for auction last week			0
historians , collectors and potential international bidders were among the 400 people who participated			0
despite the frenzy surrounding the potential site of the gun , the property worth about $ 350,000 did not sell			1
" i 'm still shocked , i do n't understand why it did not sell , " said lead auctioneer @entity148 , who speculated that potential buyers may have been scared off by the publicity surrounding the gun			0
unlike @entity31 , the owner of the neighboring property did not make an effort to find the gun			0
the property includes a modern @entity160 - style house , under which the military expert believes is the potential third location of the gun			1
and the mystery continues as both @entity31 and the owner of the neighboring home hope the gun is on their land			0
" obviously , it would be totally inappropriate to ask him for help now , " @entity31 said of the ailing 92 - year - old @entity1			0
" and there is no new information he can give us that would make finding it easier			0

he buries the gun before he is thrown into prison in 1962
the @entity22 pistol was a gift to him by an @entity92 *colonel*
it 's worth about $ 3 million , according to a museum official
