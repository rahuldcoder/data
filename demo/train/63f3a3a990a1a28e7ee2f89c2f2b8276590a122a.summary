-- you do n't need to look very hard to find @entity2 these days			1
the actor - slash - singer - slash - magician has hosted the @entity4 , performed at the @entity5 , and even headlined the @entity6 , which apparently are an actual thing			2
but despite his menagerie of ceremonial credits , the consummate entertainer admits that it 's the @entity12 -- which @entity2 is hosting for the third time on sunday , june 10 , on @entity14 -- that hold the dearest spot in his heart			1
" i think the celebratory tone of it makes it my favorite show to host , " says @entity2 , who previously celebrated @entity17 's biggest night with successful hosting gigs in 2009 and 2011			1
" in the @entity4 and in observing the @entity5 , it 's a bunch of individuals that hardly know each other that all work in their own business bubbles , and i think the opposite is true on @entity17			2
most everyone is a ) thrilled to be there , b ) even more thrilled to be nominated but c ) and i think most importantly , they all know and are supportive of each other , so you end up with this great evening where it 's not a lot of sour grapes			2
" with last year 's " @entity39 " - dominated telecast dabbling in irreverence , this year 's ceremony should be noticeably more family - oriented , thanks in no small part to the heavy presence of a solid handful of mainstream plays representing one of the medium 's best seasons in recent memory			0
despite powerful performances , plays typically tend to get short shrift at the musical - focused @entity12 â € ” a foregone conclusion of the ceremony that @entity2 hopes to change this year			1
" i 'm really trying this year to figure out a way to get performances by plays somehow in the show , " @entity2 tells @entity0			1
" every year you focus mostly on the musicals , because that 's what 's easier to put on the stage , like a three - and - a - half - minute number from ' @entity65			0
' but with so many amazing @entity67 and @entity68 , we 've got some amazing , monologue - talented people that i want to showcase the plays in a legitimate way			0
" does that mean we 'll be treated to a brief glimpse of @entity74 and @entity75 in a monologue mash - up ? ( most likely not , as that 's an awful idea on my part			0
) but what we can expect on june 10 is a high - energy telecast that commemorates the best of the year on @entity17 and cements @entity2 as a master master of ceremonies			1
" the more content i end up doing , then the less time everyone gets to spend watching performances , and really , in addition to doling out awards , that 's the reason you watch , " says @entity2 , who last year sang a duet with @entity85 , a group performance with the @entity88 cast of " @entity89 " and a full opening and closing number			2
" not to say i wo n't be around			0
i 'm hoping for the watercooler - y moments when you have to pause and go back and rewatch			0
there will be a couple surprises ! " as we count down the days until we can see what @entity2 has up his sleeve at the @entity12 , we 'll just have to make do with his opening number from last year			1
