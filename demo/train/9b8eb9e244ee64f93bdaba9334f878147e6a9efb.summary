-- during the weeks @entity2 's trial unfolds in @entity3 , @entity4 , 12 jurors and four alternates will be able to eat dinners with their families and sleep in their own beds			1
while they wo n't be isolated and watched by law enforcement , they also wo n't be able to lurk on @entity14 , casually watch tv or even talk about the sexual abuse case that careened the @entity18 community into a media storm			1
" if i were on the bench , there 's no way this jury would n't have been sequestered , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity20 said			1
" i think it 's so much more difficult for jurors to stay away from the 24 - hour news cycle , and a case like this , that touches on societal taboos and famed football			1
" @entity2 , 68 , has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years			1
prosecutors allege the former @entity18 football coach met some of his accusers through @entity39 , a charity he created for underprivileged kids			0
he has pleaded not guilty to the charges			0
opening statements are expected to begin monday , judge @entity43 said , and the trial is likely to last about three weeks			0
the trial will be held in @entity3 as prosecutors wanted			0
jurors are from the 150,000 - person county , too , as @entity2 wanted -- some of the 220 prospective jurors that reported tuesday had ties to the case 's key players , @entity18 or @entity39			1
not sequestering the jury " was pretty shocking , " @entity20 said			0
" because this is rural @entity4 , this is a really small town with so many interconnections , it strikes me as imprudent not to at least keep them away from media reports			1
" by keeping an explosive case in a small place , the judge is already placing a lot of trust in jurors -- seven women and five men -- and they 'll get clear directions on what they can and ca n't do , said @entity73 , a jury consultant on the @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity77 cases			2
@entity2 's ' make - believe world ' sequestered jurors know they 're protected from " media hordes and potential influences , " which lets them focus on the evidence , instead conversations around them at the grocery store , @entity73 said			1
but the stress of being away from family , home and work can affect how they deliberate , too : a closely bonded jury might have an easier time coming to a verdict , whether guilty or not guilty , but small personality conflicts could become major obstructions , he said			0
then , there 's the money : it 's not cheap to shelter , feed , transport and protect 12 jurors and four alternates for weeks			1
" it 's tough on state budgets because it 's darn expensive , " @entity73 said			0
last year , a judge denied a request to sequester the jury in the trial of dr. @entity111 , who was accused in @entity113 's death			2
the judge said the $ 500,000 cost did n't play a role in his decision , although he acknowledged " the state of @entity118 is undergoing severe financial problems			2
" the jury found @entity111 guilty of involuntary manslaughter			0
the estimated cost to sequester the jury for @entity74 's trial was $ 361,000 , including transportation , lodging , security and meals			1
jurors had access to certain tv channels and could go online to pay bills or order prescriptions , but their actions were closely monitored by sheriff 's deputies , and they saw their families only one afternoon every week			2
the jury found @entity136 not guilty of first - degree murder and most other charges in the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter			0
judges sometimes sequester juries while they 're deliberating , and @entity43 could backtrack on his decision if jurors could n't avoid the case outside the courtroom , @entity20 and @entity73 said			2
but @entity43 would be walking into a logistical nightmare of quickly arranging a weeks - long , sheriff - monitored sleepover for 16			0
" judges , when they make a ruling like that , are going to stick by it , " @entity73 said			0
" jurors in these high - profile cases are pretty careful about not talking to anybody , and judges get severe with news organizations -- ' you even come close to any of these jurors before this trial , and the wrath of @entity163 will come down			1
' " unless the courts are prepared , they can get really messy			0

jurors for @entity2 's sexual abuse trial wo n't be sequestered
sequestered juries are protected from media reports but face stress of being away
cost can run into *hundreds* of thousands to house , feed , and protect jurors during trials
@entity0 legal analyst : " much more difficult for jurors to stay away from the 24 - hour news cycle "
