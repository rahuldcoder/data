-- @entity2 must remove the inflammatory film " @entity4 " from @entity5 , a federal appeals court ordered wednesday			1
the film had been connected to violent demonstrations in several countries the 9th @entity9 reversed a district court 's earlier denial of an injunction that would require taking the film down			1
wednesday 's order resulted from a lawsuit filed by @entity16 , one of the actresses in the film , against @entity5 , its parent company @entity2 , and the producer of the film , @entity21 , among others			1
" @entity23 was duped into providing an artistic performance that was used in a way she never could have foreseen			0
her unwitting and unwilling inclusion in ' @entity4 ' led to serious threats against her life , " 9th circuit chief judge @entity27 wrote in his opinion			1
@entity27 wrote that @entity23 had been cast in a minor role in a film whose working title was " desert warrior , " and received about $ 500 for three and a half days of filming			1
but " desert warrior " never materialized ; instead , the scene she acted in was used in " @entity4			2
" " @entity23 first saw ' @entity4 ' after it was uploaded to @entity5 and she discovered that her brief performance had been partially dubbed over so that she appeared to be asking , ' is your @entity44 a child molester ? ' " @entity27 wrote			2
@entity23 's lawsuit also alleged that the copyright of her performance had been infringed			0
@entity2 argued " that @entity23 did n't make a protectable contribution to the film " since @entity21 -- whose aliases include @entity21 , a name cited in the lawsuit -- wrote the dialogue that @entity23 spoke , managed the production and dubbed over part of the scene , @entity27 wrote			1
@entity2 sent the following statement to @entity0 wednesday : " today the @entity61 ruled that an actress in the @entity4 trailer may have a copyright claim over her five - second appearance in the video			1
as a result the court ordered @entity2 to remove the video from our services			2
we strongly disagree with this ruling and will fight it			0
" the film portrays the @entity44 as a womanizer , buffoon , ruthless killer and child molester			0
@entity79 categorically forbids any depictions of @entity44 , and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the @entity84 world			0
the movie , backed by hardcore anti-islam groups in the @entity87 , is a low - budget project that was ignored in the @entity87 when trailers were posted on @entity5 in july 2012			0
but after @entity92 television aired certain segments , violent protests erupted in several @entity95 and @entity96 nations , and in @entity84 populations elsewhere in the world			1
the anger faded , however , particularly after filmmaker @entity21 's arrest on september 27 , 2012			2
although the film was not the direct reason for his incarceration , authorities found that his actions producing " @entity4 " violated the terms of his probation for a 2010 bank fraud conviction			1
he was released from prison in may 2013			0
@entity23 had begun receiving death threats after an @entity92 cleric called for everyone involved with the film to be killed , @entity27 wrote			0
" while answering a casting call for a low - budget amateur film does n't often lead to stardom , it also rarely turns an aspiring actress into the subject of a fatwa , " @entity27 wrote			0
@entity0 's @entity123 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
