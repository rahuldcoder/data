-- when @entity3 slipped into the role of @entity6 's finance minister in 2004 , the country 's economy was poised for rapid growth			1
@entity3 is a strong advocate of economic reform in @entity6 after spending the previous ten years hovering around the four percent mark , gross domestic product ( gdp ) jumped to 5.6 percent ( 2004/2005 )			1
by the end of 2007 , it had shot up to 7.1 percent			1
according to the @entity15 , the end of 2004 marked the start of @entity6 's " growth spurt			1
" between then and march 2007 , 2.4 million jobs were created , reducing unemployment to nine percent			1
money from the @entity21 flowed in , pushing up land prices and driving @entity6 's stock market to a record high			1
the benchmark index , the case 30 , rose 51 percent in 2007 and continued to climb in the first few weeks of 2008			1
this year , @entity6 topped the @entity28 's list of " reformers " : countries where it has become easier to do business			1
however , with growth has come inflation			2
in march 2007 , the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) peaked at 12.8 percent			2
the government says it 's since fallen to around eight percent , but some analysts are skeptical of official figures , saying the real number could be much higher			2
@entity6 's also facing a groundswell of criticism from poorer members of society who say they 're not seeing any benefits from the economic boom			1
according to the @entity28 , 17 percent of the population is living in poverty , surviving on less than one dollar a day			1
in the past few years , @entity6 has started selling off state assets , partly to raise money for social programs			2
one of the biggest sales came in 2006 with the $ 1.6 billion auction of 80 percent of the @entity54 to @entity57 bank @entity55			2
@entity58 spoke with @entity6 finance minister @entity3 in @entity59 , and asked him whether there was still the political will within @entity6 to continue with such large - scale privatizations			1
( @entity63 ) : the political will is there			0
the question is , do we still have such large - scale privatizations ? what we have created is the momentum for a private sector presence in @entity6 ; a significant , important dominant private sector in @entity6			2
we would like them to lead but we ca n't flood them with all sorts of assets that they may or may not want to buy			0
so we as the private sector is willing and we will provide them with the assets			0
but we 're pretty soon going to be running out of private assets to privatize			0
( @entity79 ) : the proportion of people who are living in absolute poverty in @entity6 is approaching 20 percent			1
what kind of pressure does that impose on you as you formulate this kind of policy ? ( @entity63 ) : we are deeply concerned about those in @entity6 society that are not touched by the reform directly , and as you say there are people who are below the poverty line , reaching almost 20 percent			1
these reform programs will trickle down , but they will not trickle down overnight			0
we have complaints in @entity6			2
a lot of those who are less privileged are complaining			0
they are complaining very loudly			0
what makes it worse is that we feel for them			0
we know that they are right to complain , and we know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform			1
( @entity79 ) : take something like opening up markets , which is something you 've done			0
you 've earned praise from @entity112 , the relevant @entity114 body , and of course from the @entity28			2
but that is n't going to help the average @entity6 living in absolute poverty , or certainly not for a while			1
( @entity63 ) : in @entity6 , we have been blessed with an economy that is flexible , that responded quickly			1
as soon as we took the basic structure of measure of tax and tariff reforms the economy responded right away			0
our investment , our foreign direct investment went from $ 450 million dollars a year to $ 11 billion in under three years			0
this is a quick response			0
now we 're hoping that we will have an equally quick response in reaching to the underprivileged			0
( @entity79 ) : so reform is clearly a good word in @entity6 , but so far only on the economic scale			1
is there a feeling that it has to flow over into the political sphere , that there has to be political reform ? ( @entity63 ) : it already has spilled over into the political sphere			0
it has been spilling over in the political sphere for the past five , six , seven years			0
the dynamics are different in the political sphere			0
it 's a lot more difficult to get the political reforms we want than it is to get the economic ones			0
both -- and i can state this with confidence -- both are equally important ; they just happen to move with different dynamics			0

as @entity6 's finance minister , @entity3 has pushed for reform
@entity6 's economy grew 7.1 percent in 2007 , inflation still a concern
@entity28 : 17 percent of @entity6 population living in poverty
@entity3 : " we know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform "
