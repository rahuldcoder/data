-- sometimes a single moment in time captures the essence of an individual			1
that became clear to me in late june 1995			1
we were at the end of a grueling three days in @entity8 interviewing @entity9 , the state 's former segregationist governor and nemesis of president @entity12 , for @entity14 's maiden interview in his new magazine , @entity16			1
the enfeebled governor was barely coherent during the 10 hours we sat with him , and we were panicked there would be a gaping hole in our inaugural issue			1
worse , @entity14 himself was sick with a thyroid condition that left him lethargic , cranky and frighteningly thin			2
adding to the anxiety of the moment , he was carrying around an engagement ring in the hope his girlfriend , @entity27 , would accept when he proposed to her that weekend			1
imagine our appreciation when two amiable @entity29 with close ties to the governor offered us a quiet dinner at a roadside restaurant			1
but as we approached the restaurant , i suddenly noticed there were perhaps a hundred cars parked alongside the road -- the restaurant parking lot itself was overflowing			2
i looked over at @entity14 , and he at me , and we both realized in that same instant : we 'd been played			2
this would be no quiet dinner for four , but the show - and - tell of an @entity45 icon			1
" i 'm not doing it , " he said to me angrily as we sat in the back of the car , mulling our options			2
" i 'm going back to the hotel			0
" but one thing @entity14 had in more abundance than anyone i knew was grace			0
and he would n't let down the 200 or so people who had gathered in the restaurant or embarrass our hosts , who had covertly planned this minirally			0
so @entity14 put on his tie , set aside his fury and gamely walked across the dirt driveway and gave himself up to the adoring crowd			0
for the next two hours , as only @entity14 could , he charmed everyone , signing dozens of pictures of his father , standing for dozens more and patiently listening to the endless stories people related of their ties to his extended family			0
what i realized that night , and what has stayed with me these past 15 years since his passing , is this : no one of my generation was born with more privilege or promise than @entity14 , yet no one wore it more comfortably			1
when we walked out of the restaurant , @entity14 smiled at me and without the slightest irony said , " that was really fun			0
" and he meant it			0
join us on @entity86 / @entity85 .			0
