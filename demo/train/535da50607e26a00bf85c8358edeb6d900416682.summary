@entity6 claimed an unexpected victory in the 3,000m steeplechase in @entity10 in 1972			2
the first black @entity11 to break onto the international stage at the beginning of the 1960s , @entity6 won two @entity16 golds and was a formidable force in the sport for 12 years			1
other athletes would win more golds , but few would win races and hold records at all distances from 1,500 meters to 10,000 meters			1
@entity6 was 24 - years - old before he competed at his first @entity16 in @entity24 in 1964 where he finished 10th and fifth in the 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters respectively			2
in 1965 he broke two world records : the 3,000m at @entity27 in @entity28 in seven minutes 39.6 seconds ( his first attempt at the distance ) ; and the 5,000m in @entity31 in 13 minutes 24.2 seconds			0
his form looked good for the high - altitude games of @entity34 in 1968 , but stomach cramps forced him out of the 10,000m with just two laps to go			0
he recovered to win a stunning gold in the 1,500m			1
knowing that race favorite , @entity40 had a devastating kick in the final hundreds , @entity6 decided to hit the front early			0
he managed to hold on and finished 20 meters ahead of @entity44 -- the largest winning margin and the second fastest time in the event 's history			0
born to run in the same year he also took a silver in the 5,000m			1
he had run six races in just eight days despite a gallbladder infection			1
but it was at the @entity53 of 1972 that the untrained @entity55 tribesman from @entity56 , in the high plains of @entity58 , proved he was born to run			1
in the steeplechase , with only one win from his previous four competitive attempts at the event and twenty - three others lining up with better personal times , @entity6 was not even expected to make the final			0
yet , somehow he staved off challenges from his more experienced compatriot , @entity68 , and @entity70 's @entity69 , to win in an @entity16 record time of eight minutes 23.6 seconds			2
@entity6 will be remembered for two things : opening up the latent athletic talent of @entity2 and his disquieting natural ability to conquer all - comers in five distinct events			0
when he finally retired after the @entity77 in @entity78 in 1975 , he fittingly returned home to a daughter he and his wife had named @entity82 .			0
