editor 's note : @entity2 is an @entity3 - winning and @entity5 - winning novelist			1
she is based in @entity6			2
her web site is @entity8 /			0
the @entity2 sisters -- @entity10 , left , @entity2 , center , and @entity12 -- prepare for a @entity14 concert in 1984			1
@entity6 , @entity15 ( @entity16 ) -- @entity14 died thursday , and my family gathered by telephone from @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity15 and @entity22 to mourn and remember			1
but we began mourning long ago			1
i was 17 when the " @entity25 25th @entity24 " aired in 1983 , and my parents , sisters and i first saw @entity14 moonwalk to " @entity28			1
" he sent a lightning bolt through our living room , and all of us leaped to our feet with shouts			0
he may have been the best entertainer i live to see			0
his music asked us to transcend race and geography , hate and bigotry , and made us feel like we were the world			0
in recent months , i showed my 5 - year - old son , @entity41 , that @entity25 performance on @entity43			0
" @entity28 " made @entity41 want to moonwalk and wear a glove			0
" @entity45 " inspired @entity41 to kick his leg and fling his head from side to side like @entity14			1
but it has been a long time since i could watch @entity14 videos without feeling sad			1
his death is only the next stage of the loss			2
@entity14 left the music world to mourn -- but many of us , especially black @entity58 , felt like we lost a family member on thursday			1
he pained and puzzled us , but we still loved him			2
until thursday , some of us had forgotten how much			0
@entity14 was not always easy to love			1
he tested us , sometimes asking us to ignore what we could see with our own eyes			0
we may never know fully what @entity14 did or did n't do , but he was like the lost relative we wished we could bring back to shore			1
when @entity41 asked questions about @entity14 's changing face in the videos , i showed him the beautiful brown - skinned , bright - eyed little boy who grew up in my family 's living room			1
there is supreme irony in the death of @entity14 the same year as the inauguration of the first black president			1
@entity14 , who would ascend higher than any black artist in music history , learned a bitter lesson : even at the top of the mountain , there is only the man in the mirror			1
@entity41 is n't old enough to fully understand black and white , why his grandmother was sent to jail for ordering a hamburger at a @entity90 lunch counter in 1960 , or how an ill - used child 's soul might never find its way back home			2
so i told @entity41 about the time @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity12 and @entity10 [ now an assistant general counsel at @entity16 ] drove from @entity99 to @entity100 to see the @entity102 ' @entity101 in 1984 , when @entity14 ruled the world			1
how his aunties and i dressed up for the concert in our own gloves			0
after the concert , still floating from the surreal experience , we approached a stretch limousine on the highway			0
as my father sidled our car closer and my sisters and i pressed our noses to the window to try to see , the limo 's tinted electric window slid down			0
a sparkling silver glove waved out to us			0
when we saw that glove , the whole car screamed -- even my father , who was driving			0
my sisters and i begged my father to follow the limousine ... and it finally came to a stop in front of our budget hotel			0
when the rear door opened , a white blond - haired decoy stepped out -- wearing a silver @entity14 glove			2
if only we 'd never seen past the tinted window			0
if only we had a perfect memory of @entity14 waving goodbye			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : my family mourned the loss of @entity14 last week
in some ways , she says , the mourning began long ago with his puzzling *behavior*
she says many black americans forgot how much they loved him
