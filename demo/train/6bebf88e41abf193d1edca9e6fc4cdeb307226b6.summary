-- job burnout can strike workers in nearly any field , but a new study finds that doctors are at special risk			1
nearly 1 in 2 @entity8 physicians report at least one symptom of burnout , with doctors at the front line of care particularly vulnerable , the study found -- a significantly higher rate than among the general working population			1
overtaxed doctors are not only at risk for personal problems , like relationship issues and alcohol misuse , but their job - related fatigue can also erode professionalism , compromise quality of care , increase medical errors and encourage early retirement -- a potentially critical problem as an aging population demands more medical care			1
the new findings , published in the @entity31 , are based on a survey of 7,288 physicians conducted in june 2011			0
led by researchers from the @entity36 and the @entity37 , the study asked participating physicians to fill out a questionnaire asking about their feelings of burnout -- including " emotional exhaustion " or losing enthusiasm for their work ; feelings of cynicism or " depersonalization " ; and a low sense of personal accomplishment			2
seriously ? doctors say they 're underpaid the 22 - item questionnaire , called the @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , is considered the gold standard for measuring burnout ; the doctors also completed a shorter , modified version of the @entity54 , the answers to which researchers used to compare with the general population			1
researchers also asked doctors how long they worked each week , how satisfied they were with their work - life balance , and whether they had any symptoms of depression or thoughts of suicide			0
@entity0 's mobile tech issue : better care delivered by @entity70 , @entity71 the data showed that rates of burnout were high : 45.8 % of doctors experienced at least one symptom of work - related burnout			1
when each symptom was considered separately , 37.9 % of the physicians had high emotional exhaustion , 29.4 % had high depersonalization and 12.4 % had a low sense of personal accomplishment			0
@entity8 doctors are burning out " at an alarming level , " the authors write			1
" our finding is concerning given the extensive literature linking burnout to medical errors and lower quality of care , " says study author dr. @entity87 of the @entity36			1
" most previous studies of physicians from individual specialties have suggested a burnout rate of 30 % to 40 %			0
thus , the prevalence of burnout among physicians appears to be higher than in the past			0
" the study found that practitioners of front - line care -- including physicians in emergency medicine , general internal medicine and family medicine -- fared worst			2
" nearly 60 % of physicians in those specialties had high levels of burnout , " says @entity87			0
" this is concerning since many elements critical to the success of health care reform are built upon increasing the role of the primary care providers			0
" doctors practicing pathology , dermatology , general pediatrics and preventive medicine ( including occupational health and environmental medicine ) had the lowest rates of burnout			2
@entity0 's mobile tech issue : tracking disease one text at a time the researchers also compared physicians ' job - related fatigue with that of 3,442 working @entity8 adults in the general population , and found that physicians were significantly more burned out overall			1
among other working adults , only 27.8 % were likely to experience burnout , 23.5 % had high emotional exhaustion and 15 % had high depersonalization			0
the authors found also that physicians worked about 10 hours more per week than other people on average ( 50 hours a week versus 40 ) , and were much more likely to work extra long weeks of 60 hours or more : 37.9 % of doctors worked at least 60 - hour weeks , compared with only 10.6 % of the general population			1
more than 40 % of doctors reported dissatisfaction with their work - life balance , saying their jobs did n't leave enough time for a personal life or family , compared with 23.1 % of non-doctors			0
why doctors fall asleep while treating you in addition , while higher levels of education were associated with less risk of burnout for people in other professions , doctors ' advanced degrees did n't afford them the same protection from job - related stress			2
" while individuals in other professions do experience burnout , it seems to be largely driven by the hours , " says @entity87			0
" in addition to their high work hours , there appears to be factors related to the nature of the work that increase the risk for physicians			0
" @entity0 : should @entity179 be expanded ? study finds it may lower death rates " unfortunately , little evidence exists about how to address this problem , " the authors write , urging additional research to figure out what can be done to support doctors at the individual , organizational and societal level			1
" policy makers and health care organizations must address the problem of physician burnout for the sake of physicians and their patients			2
