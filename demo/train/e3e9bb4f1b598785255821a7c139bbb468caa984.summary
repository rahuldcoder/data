@entity0 , @entity1 -- campaign workers distributed campaign leaflets and plastered candidate posters along the @entity1 capital 's tree - lined streets in the final days before friday 's parliamentary elections			1
@entity1 cell phones also lit up with text messages advertising names of candidates			1
meanwhile , @entity1 state television broadcast wall - to - wall programming encouraging voters to cast their ballots			1
with slogans like " our progress in science and economics depends on your vote , " the publicity campaign included an oft - repeated quote from the late founder of the @entity20 , ayatollah @entity19 , saying , " the measure of a nation is its vote			1
" but out on the traffic - clogged streets of @entity0 , some @entity1 appeared less than enthusiastic about the election			1
at the @entity34 where young men were handing out campaign leaflets , an elderly man confronted a passing turbaned cleric , yelling " why should we vote ? " when a @entity2 reporter asked another man about the election , he hurried away , saying " i 'm not going to vote , so i 'm afraid to talk			1
" " i do n't want to take part in this election , " said another young man , who asked not to be named			2
asked why he was boycotting the vote , he answered , " everyone has his own viewpoint			2
for example , someone says ' i like the system			0
' or someone says ' i do n't			0
i 'm the opposite of the system			0
' and that 's why			0
" in @entity1 , elections are traditionally heralded by the revolutionary regime as a popular demonstration that it enjoys the overwhelming support of the population			1
but this friday 's contest will also mark the first time @entity1 go to the polls since allegations of vote - rigging during presidential elections in 2009 triggered mass street demonstrations against the regime			1
security forces subsequently used deadly force to crack down on the opposition @entity68			0
presidential candidates @entity70 and @entity71 were placed under house arrest , where they remain			0
international human rights organization reported the arrest of thousands of other activists			0
scores of high - ranking opposition campaign workers and political activists fled to exile to neighboring @entity80 , where some claimed in interviews with @entity2 that they endured torture in @entity1 prisons			1
but at a campaign rally for candidates from the conservative @entity88 on wednesday , one lawmaker running for re-election offered a decidedly different account of the aftermath of the 2009 vote			1
" during the 2009 elections , attempts were made to use cheating in the elections as an excuse to plot against the regime , " said @entity92			2
" attempts were made to show the world that there is no democracy in @entity1 and that the people are not the ones who have the power to elect their leaders , " she said			1
" that 's why the friday elections represent the people 's will to participate in determining their own future and their country 's fate			0
" there are no candidates from the @entity68 in this year 's parliamentary election			2
instead , @entity1 political analysts describe friday 's vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government			1
" the underlying issue is whether or not you support [ @entity1 president @entity128 ] @entity127 , " said @entity123 , a political scientist at @entity124			1
" it 's a rivalry between @entity127 on the one hand and the supreme leader on the other ... not overtly , and not directly of course			0
" @entity1 's @entity135 ayatollah @entity134 publicly supported @entity127 's controversial re-election victory during the dispute over the 2009 ballot results			1
but tensions have flared between the two leaders over the last year			0
@entity127 disappeared from public view for 11 days after @entity134 over-ruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister			0
several of @entity127 's top political allies have also been subjected to lawsuits and investigations			0
the @entity149 newspaper , which is run by a trusted ally of @entity134 , has publicly denounced @entity127 's top adviser , @entity151 , accusing him of " leading a deviant current			0
" in the run - up to this week 's vote , @entity134 has urged factions to overcome previous divisions , by calling repeatedly for unity			1
according to @entity1 state media , there are more then 3,400 candidates competing now for some 290 seats in parliament			1
@entity1 analysts said the @entity88 represents one of the leading groups of candidates			1
it faces a challenge from a group of @entity127 supporters who announced the creation of their ballot list , the @entity174 , just days before the election			2
at the @entity88 rally on friday , where candidates took turns addressing several hundred people seated on the floor of a mosque , candidate @entity92 sought to downplay previous divisions between pro- and @entity184 conservative factions			0
she placed all of these groups under the same " principalist " ideological umbrella			0
" we view all the principalists as members of one family , " she said			0
" but there are differences in views and tastes which show how dynamic the principalist group still is			0
" any possible divisions within the ruling conservative government fade rapidly , however , when confronted by @entity1 's greatest adversaries , the @entity200 and @entity201			1
at a speech before thousands of supporters on wednesday , @entity134 accused the @entity200 and its allies of trying to stop @entity1 from voting on friday			1
intelligence minister @entity205 went one step further , saying a " high voter turnout will be a punch in the face of arrogant powers , " according to state - run @entity211			2
this was a view shared by some on the streets of @entity0			0
some @entity1 blamed increasingly harsh @entity200 economic sanctions for the precipitous drop in the value of @entity1 's currency over the last several months			2
others pointed to the recent series of assassinations of @entity1 nuclear scientists , which the @entity1 government has blamed on foreign agents			2
amid the rush of commuters moving through @entity0 's busy @entity229 was a clerk named @entity231 , who said he would vote for any candidate who was honest , and who " followed the @entity135			0
" " we hate the politics of the @entity200 the @entity200 is supporting @entity236 and betraying @entity1 , " @entity231 said			2
almost as an afterthought , he added , " @entity240 , death to @entity201 , " before politely shaking hands with his interlocutor and saying goodbye .			0
