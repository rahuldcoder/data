-- some generations get " @entity7 " as a monument to their youthful folly : gleaming hotrods , drive - ins and @entity6			2
others get " @entity9 , " " @entity10 " or " @entity11			0
" but if you were graduating high school around the summer of 1999 , chances are your collective cinematic talisman involves horny @entity16 pleasuring himself with an apple pie			0
" @entity31 " spawned two sequels in rapid succession , taking sex - mad @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity23 and pals through college and even into matrimony ( " @entity27 " ) , but it 's a surprise to reconnect with the old gang nine years later , older , milder , but still hungering for a bigger slice			1
the reunion is the brainchild of @entity34 and @entity35 , the writers - turned - directors who made their name on a different but not dissimilar series , " @entity40			1
" the original director , @entity41 , has long since graduated to bigger , not necessarily better , things such as " @entity43 " and " @entity44			0
" it 's not a bad idea at that , even if @entity51 's recent " @entity50 " covered many of the same bases			1
@entity34 and @entity35 respect the formula : whackily contrived sex gags sugared with sentimentality and a sliver of feminist sanity ; multiple humiliations for the nice but naughty @entity20 ; worse still for the cocky @entity23 ; and embarrassingly crude heart to hearts with @entity20 's loveable dad ( caterpillar - browed comedian @entity60 )			1
fans will appreciate the filmmakers ' dedication , and if they 're not particularly adept in the execution , maybe they do n't have to be : nostalgia is the most forgiving mistress			0
@entity20 ( @entity16 ) is still married to @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , but both are mired in parental sexual frustration			1
@entity22 ( @entity72 ) is now a cable tv celebrity with a model for a girlfriend			0
@entity76 ( anyone remember @entity78 ? ) is terminally boring			0
and @entity79 ( @entity80 ) has been around the world twice and has the scars to prove it			0
as for perpetual bad boy @entity23 ( @entity84 ) , he 's assistant to a bullying business executive , but still a legendary jerk in his own puerile imagination			1
some of the girls are back too ( @entity89 , @entity90 , even @entity91 in an afterthought of a cameo ) , but predictably , the movie only pays lip service to gender equality			0
@entity101 , hotter newcomers @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 get more screen time			1
where @entity100 picked up her strong @entity105 accent is a mystery , but along with @entity107 , she 's one of @entity109 ' few concessions to ethnic diversity			1
the hard truth is time has not been kind to most of the cast			2
they were always a funny looking bunch			0
many of them were in their mid- 20s but able to pass for teenagers back when the first film was shot			2
today , they seem pale , pinched or gaunt -- thoroughly ordinary - looking in a way that would normally have casting agents glazing over			0
only the effortlessly egregious @entity84 still has a viable career in leading roles , and it 's hard to see @entity23 as anything more than a step backward for him			2
of course , this is the film 's greatest weakness and its secret strength : the unspoken appeal of a reunion is the chance to go back , measure up your peers and perhaps find that they 're not doing any better than you are			1
it 's certainly the most endearing aspect of a spotty , crude but affectionate sex comedy that 's been thoroughly superseded by the rude sophistication of the @entity141 comedies " @entity31 " inspired in the first place .			2

the film 's greatest weakness and its secret strength is the unspoken appeal of a reunion
@entity20 is still married to @entity68 , but both are mired in parental sexual frustration
younger newcomers @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 get lots of screen time
