@entity1 president @entity0 says neo-fascist far - right groups are firmly behind the putsch -- coup d'etat -- in @entity6 and questions the democratic credentials of " men with black masks and @entity11 " who became the poster children of the @entity14 for @entity1			1
does this assessment have any truth to it ? in the fast - moving and chronically complex course of events in @entity21 , the issue has been debated from the beginning : the role of the far right in the events that led to the toppling of the @entity27 government and in the present and future disposition of political power in the country			1
there are some known facts : first , far - right , anti-semitic , anti-russian and openly fascist groups have existed and do exist as a blight on modern @entity21			1
a 2012 @entity37 resolution condemned the main -- but by no means most extreme -- ultra-right party , @entity40 , as " racist , anti-semitic and xenophobic			1
" this extraordinary @entity43 resolution contains 18 points of concern over policies embedded in laws of the @entity48 , or @entity37			2
a key paragraph reads that the @entity43 " is concerned about the rising nationalistic sentiment in @entity21			1
" the @entity37 stresses that " racist , anti-semitic and xenophobic views go against the @entity43 's fundamental values and principles			0
" the resolution also appeals to pro-democratic parties in the @entity48 " not to associate with , endorse or form coalitions with this party			0
" as if to endorse the sentiments of the @entity43 resolution , the leader of @entity40 ( or " freedom " ) , @entity60 , is on record saying that @entity6 is governed by " a @entity65 - @entity1 mafia " and has said @entity21 bravely fought @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity65 " and other scum " in @entity69 this unsavory constituency , including the " ultra " @entity72 movement , manned the barricades in the @entity6 uprising , providing " security " to the mainstream political opposition leaders and matching the pro-government forces in violent tactics that led to the dozens of dead in and around the @entity14			1
these rightist - nationalist forces were in large part responsible for the collapse of the agreement signed in february that called for early parliamentary and presidential elections and a return to the 2004 @entity21 constitution , which harks back to the " @entity88 " that brought a @entity90 government to power in @entity21			2
in backing away from this face - saving compromise , one that was negotiated with the approval of the @entity97 , @entity67 and @entity98 governments , and which surely would have resulted in the removal of @entity27 , moderate opposition leaders essentially capitulated to the far right			0
the @entity1 position is also somewhat bolstered by the fact that @entity40 holds key posts in the interim government in @entity6 , including that of deputy prime minister			1
@entity107 , the commander of the " @entity14 self - defense , " has been appointed the head of the @entity110 , and the leader of the @entity72 ultras , @entity111 , is expected to become his deputy chairman			0
@entity40 controls the prosecutor general office and the ministries of ecology and agriculture			0
at very least , the interim government has made bedfellows of some highly suspect and divisive forces			0
but it is also true to say that many of the specific details of far - right activity and influence are anecdotal and perhaps contradictory			0
on the one hand , there are reports of @entity65 homes in @entity130 and the western part of @entity21 being daubed with anti-semitic slogans ; on the other , @entity21 's head rabbi has weighed in with the opinion that @entity135 is " not on the rise			0
" a group of @entity65 groups sent an open letter to @entity0 that said , in part , " your certainty of the growth of @entity135 in @entity21 also does not correspond to the actual facts			1
" it is also true that far - right forces are on the rise across @entity148 , including in the " respectable " democracies of the @entity150 , and that their targets range from @entity65 to @entity152 to gays to any " out " group , including the miscellany of new immigrants who are encouraged under @entity43 laws of free movement			2
finally , it is true that the long reach of memory evokes images from 70 years ago , those of robust support in western @entity21 for the fascist side during @entity69 this is especially true in the east and south of a divided country , those regions that look to @entity66 rather than to @entity170 or @entity171			0
but these various points do not alter the fact that the @entity37 undertook the extraordinary measure of singling out @entity21 ultra-nationalism , nor do they gainsay the role of its most influential exponent , @entity40 , in the new interim government			1
in this context , and even as they may disagree on specific measures to be taken the path toward a prosperous , peaceful , united , democratic @entity21 , sober observers agree that this can be achieved only with the marginalization of the far right			2
unfortunately , the appointments of ultra-rightists to the interim government place this in serious question			0
looking ahead , we must hope that the meeting in @entity171 of the @entity148 foreign ministers , including @entity1 -- the first , we assume , of several -- may create a blueprint for @entity21 based on cooperative solutions rather than confrontation .			2

@entity1 president @entity0 says violent far - right groups are behind coup d'etat in @entity6
@entity201 : far - right activity might be *exaggerated* , but @entity43 has condemned them
@entity201 : the far - right party @entity40 holds key posts in the new @entity21 government
he says the far right must be marginalized to attain a democratic , peaceful @entity21
