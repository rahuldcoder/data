-- @entity1 can handle the truth			1
even if that truth could include a coverup at the powerful @entity5			1
the @entity5 mission statement pledges to " enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all			2
" but public scrutiny has revealed details indicating a level of politicization totally at odds with that			0
look at the two eye - opening developments that have happened at the @entity5 since may : an acting @entity5 commissioner resigned , and another powerful @entity5 official refused to answer questions before @entity21 , pleading the @entity22			1
whatever is going on , there is only one way to proceed , and that is a professional and thorough investigation			0
for people who have n't been following a lot of this , let me quickly get you up to speed : the @entity5 inspector general released a report on may 14 describing how the agency had inappropriately targeted @entity37 and conservative groups that had applied for tax - exempt status			1
then the @entity5 put these groups through extra reviews , substantial delays and burdensome requests for information			1
the next day , president @entity46 announced that the acting @entity5 commissioner was resigning			1
that does n't exactly happen every day			0
@entity46 went on to say , " i will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency , but especially in the @entity5 , given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives			2
" after that shocking disclosure , several things happened : @entity58 and @entity59 committees launched investigations into the scandal			0
the @entity62 began a criminal investigation			0
the @entity5 inspector general expanded its ongoing investigation			1
@entity5 official @entity65 exercised her @entity22 right against self - incrimination by refusing to answer questions before @entity21			1
some interesting developments emerged from all that			0
for one , the original claim during @entity5 testimony -- that the scandal was the result of a couple of " rogue @entity5 agents " in the agency 's @entity77 field office -- did n't hold water			2
it turned out that , according to frontline @entity5 agents in @entity77 interviewed by @entity85 investigators , the @entity82 @entity5 office had played a key role in the handling of the tea party applications			1
retired @entity5 lawyer @entity89 disclosed in testimony that @entity5 counsel @entity90 was one of his supervisors in the targeting of conservative groups			1
( the @entity5 has denied @entity90 ' involvement in the targeting of specific groups			1
) the inspector general 's report found that @entity90 ' office had sent the exempt organizations determination unit on april 24 , 2012 , " additional comments on the draft guidance " for considering applications of tea party groups for tax - exempt status ( @entity104 )			1
read the inspector general 's report the connections between @entity90 ' office and the inappropriate profiling of conservative groups are especially noteworthy because there are only two appointees of the president at the @entity5 : the commissioner and the chief counsel			1
cynics may view this controversy as typical when the @entity59 is in the hands of a different party than the president , but guess what ? the @entity124 - controlled @entity58 's @entity123 has also weighed in			2
that committee has called for three things : a hearing , an investigation and a request to the @entity5 for documents			1
@entity132 @entity131 sen. @entity131 , the committee chairman , stated bluntly , " targeting groups based on their political views is not only inappropriate , it is intolerable , unacceptable and can not be allowed			0
" @entity131 promised a bipartisan investigation and has been true to his word			0
when the first week of august arrived , @entity131 and his @entity140 counterpart , sen. @entity139 of @entity141 , said the @entity5 failed to provide " most of the information requested by the @entity123			2
" new details reshape @entity5 targeting scandal as chairman of the ethics watchdog group @entity147 , i had filed a complaint with the @entity5 in may 2011 showing that a purported charity called the @entity150 -- named for the father of president @entity46 and run by his half - brother , @entity153 -- had been raising funds in the @entity1 by falsely claiming to be an @entity5 - approved charitable group			1
i submitted proof that the foundation was not tax - deductible and had never even applied for that status despite the fact that it had been fundraising for about three years			1
in fact , one of the foundation 's directors admitted that an @entity5 application had never been submitted			2
there was compelling evidence suggesting that the foundation was raising money on the internet by misrepresenting itself as being @entity5 - approved when it really was n't			1
suddenly , the foundation rushed an application to the @entity5 in late may 2011			2
in the short span of about a month , @entity65 -- the same person who took the @entity22 rather than testify before @entity21 -- gave the @entity176 its tax - deductible status			1
and , the @entity5 made that status retroactive for three years			1
even more curious , several of the forms submitted by @entity153 were stamped as being received by the @entity5 in july 2011			2
that 's one month after @entity65 approved the group 's new tax status			2
generally , the approval process for charitable groups seeking tax - deductible status takes longer than it does for groups that merely want to be tax - exempt , such as most of the tea party groups			1
in any case , there 's a good chance this scandal could last a while			0
anyone who follows @entity82 scandals knows that investigations can take months , sometimes years			0
that story broke during the presidential campaign of 1972			0
the president 's press secretary dismissed it as a third - rate burglary			0
the investigation was slow because there was an active pushback from the @entity207 administration and the people being investigated			0
the end finally came in august 1974 , when president @entity207 resigned			0
' enemies list ' wo n't be tolerated , says @entity140 lawmaker was there a coverup here , like there was in the @entity196 ? i have no idea			0
but it could easily be argued that there are a lot of signs pointing in that direction : multiple investigations were cut off ; document processing was delayed ; a key official took the @entity22			1
@entity225 says @entity46 administration marked by ' culture of intimidation ' when the issue involves the integrity of an institution as powerful as the @entity5 , the media and the public are entitled to a thorough , professional investigation			1
anything less leads an already cynical public to become even more cynical			0
if it comes to the appointment of a special prosecutor , that , i believe , should be reserved as a last resort			0
the administration says there 's no political basis for the @entity5 actions			2
if that 's true , then it has nothing to lose			0
sometimes , though , the truth hurts			0
whatever happens , @entity1 can handle it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253			0
