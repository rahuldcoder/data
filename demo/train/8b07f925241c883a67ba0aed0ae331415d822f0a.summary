the uproar in @entity1 over the arrest of an @entity1 diplomat in @entity4 is growing			1
@entity1 are protesting outside the @entity6 in @entity7 , the @entity1 government has revoked privileges for @entity10 diplomats , and @entity1 politicians have called for a review of their nation 's ties with the @entity10			1
e-mail and @entity17 appeals are even calling on @entity1 to refuse to meet with any @entity10 citizen			1
but the outcry over @entity21 's treatment is drowning out the serious allegations of exploiting her employee , also an @entity1 national , and the pervasive violations against millions of other domestic workers around the world and in the homes of diplomats in @entity10			1
@entity21 , @entity1 's deputy consul general in @entity4 , was arrested last week over allegations of falsifying visa application documents for a woman who worked as her housekeeper and nanny in @entity4			2
@entity21 reported she paid the woman $ 4,500 a month			0
in reality , federal prosecutors say , the domestic worker received less than $ 600 a month and was forced to work far more than 40 hours a week			1
her effective hourly wage -- $ 3.13 -- was less than half of @entity4 's minimum wage of $ 7.25			0
many @entity1 are outraged over allegations that @entity21 , after leaving her daughter at school , was handcuffed on the street -- although this has been disputed -- later strip - searched and kept in a holding cell before being released on $ 250,000 bail			2
@entity10 attorney @entity51 , in a written statement , said @entity21 was arrested discreetly , was not handcuffed and was given time to arrange personal matters including child care -- but she was searched in custody as is " standard practice for every defendant , rich or poor , @entity10 or not , in order to make sure that no prisoner keeps anything on his person that could harm anyone , including himself			2
" there 's no doubt that strip searches , a routine part of @entity10 felony arrests , are humiliating			1
@entity1 are understandably disturbed by a practice that is rare in @entity1 and seems particularly degrading			1
but the treatment of domestic workers , who number more than 50 million worldwide and are one of every 13 female wage earners , is often even more degrading			1
they are typically grossly underpaid and often mistreated			0
in our investigations in the @entity10 and elsewhere , @entity74 has found that women who work as nannies and housekeepers , and often both , make far below the minimum wage and are often expected to work 14 to 18 hours a day			1
millions of women and girls travel across borders to earn money as domestic workers to send back to their families			1
they take care of elderly people in the homes where they work , cook , clean and take care of their employers ' children			0
they generate billions of dollars in remittances for their countries of origin but are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse			0
many are forced to pay huge sums to unscrupulous recruiters , or work without pay for several months to cover their debt			0
cut off from their family and other sources of support , many feel they have little choice but to work under slavelike conditions			0
in some cases , they are locked in their workplaces			0
unpaid wages , excessive working hours and physical , sexual and psychological abuse are the most common problems			2
domestic workers have even fewer options when their employers have diplomatic immunity and can not be criminally prosecuted , regardless of how severe their crimes			1
the employers have control over their visas , which also leaves them with little recourse			0
the @entity129 has received dozens of allegations of abuse by foreign diplomats and by officials at the @entity134 and other international financial institutions			2
in one case that became public , a former domestic worker accused her employer , a @entity140 diplomat , of raping her repeatedly			1
in another , a domestic worker for a former @entity143 ambassador said she was forced to work 126 hours a week without pay			1
a 2008 @entity147 report identified 42 cases of abuse by diplomats with immunity over an eight - year period , and said that the actual number was probably higher			2
many cases are never reported because the victims are too frightened to complain or feel they ca n't afford to lose the job			0
as a consular official , @entity21 has limited immunity , which the @entity129 says does not cover visa fraud , a felony			0
too many diplomats have used their immunity to exploit their employees			0
by taking action in this case , the @entity129 is sending an important message -- no employer is above the law			0
it is not just singling out foreign diplomats			0
the @entity21 case has raised good questions about the treatment of criminal suspects in the @entity10 , including the use of routine strip searches			1
but that debate should not be at the expense of women exploited as domestic workers			2
their treatment is just as important .			0
