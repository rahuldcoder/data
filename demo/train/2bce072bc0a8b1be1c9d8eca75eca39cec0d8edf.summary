-- in january , @entity1 sat down for a long interview with the @entity3			1
that was noteworthy in itself ; the @entity7 leader does n't spend much time with the @entity10 media			0
he was in confident mood -- saying that @entity7 would not succumb to the unrest then spreading in @entity13 and @entity14			0
that same month @entity15 ran an effusive feature on @entity7 's first lady , @entity17 , describing her as a " rose in the desert			1
" but in his interview , @entity1 also recognized " anger and desperation " in the region and the need for reform in @entity7 , to " open up the society , " as he put it			1
@entity26 was needed , he said , but " if you do it just because of what happened in @entity13 and @entity14 , then it is going to be a reaction , not an action ; and as long as what you are doing is a reaction you are going to fail			1
" now , after 10 days of deadly protests in @entity7 , that " reaction " is well and truly under way			0
the government has responded with a mixture of aggression and appeasement			1
it has announced a substantial rise in wages for public employees , and has proposed ending the decades - long state of emergency and opening up @entity7 's cramped political space to other parties			1
the current @entity7 constitution enshrines the leadership of the @entity49 , which both @entity1 and his father , @entity50 , who died in 2000 , have led			1
at the same time , security forces have swamped @entity52 and other towns in the south ; witnesses speak of a mysterious group of men dressed in black patrolling the streets of @entity59			0
@entity60 reports widespread arrests of political activists			0
but the protests have continued , and one @entity65 page following the unrest -- @entity67 -- now has nearly 100,000 followers			0
the regime 's carrot - and - stick approach may work in the short term but the widely respected @entity72 says president @entity1 has two starkly different options			1
" one involves an immediate and inevitably risky political initiative that might convince the @entity7 people that the regime is willing to undertake dramatic change			2
the other entails escalating repression , which has every chance of leading to a bloody and ignominious end			0
" while it has tinkered with reform over the past 10 years , @entity1 's government is hamstrung by internal disagreement , endemic corruption and competing goals at home and in the region			1
that at least is the picture that emerges from analyzing the @entity93 diplomatic cables obtained by @entity94			1
the cables acknowledge that @entity1 has allowed greater media freedom since he became president 11 years ago " with @entity98 , the local favorite , and @entity100 readily available via satellite			1
" local journalists spoke of shifting red lines , adding wryly that " it was much simpler under @entity50 ; we always knew where the red lines were			0
" caution has been the watchword in other spheres , including a tentative " reset " of @entity7 's frosty relationship with the @entity93 since president @entity111 took office and a gradual reassertion of @entity7 's role in @entity115			2
the younger @entity1 has blamed a rough neighborhood for slow progress at home			1
" we are not the only captain , " he told the @entity3			0
" we were affected by the situation in @entity122 or in @entity115			0
there are many things that we wanted to do in 2005 we are planning to do in 2012			0
" the cables shed light on how @entity7 has been run -- with powerful and often competing cliques dominating economic and political life , and intrigue trumping open debate			2
part of the diplomatic traffic is devoted to the power of " regime financiers " like telecom magnate @entity135 , @entity1 's cousin			1
a @entity93 contact is quoted in a cable as saying " most @entity7 viewed @entity135 in a negative light and his strong - arm business tactics had earned him many enemies			2
" the same cable says corruption " was rife in @entity7 government and society and had undermined the president 's credibility with the @entity7 people			1
" there is also evidence of serious rifts within the security apparatus , with one cable from 2008 reporting that " @entity155 and @entity156 officials are currently engaged in an internecine struggle to blame each other for the breach of security " that occurred in @entity161 when @entity163 's military commander , @entity162 , was killed by a car bomb			2
several months later , a top adviser to @entity1 -- gen. @entity166 -- was shot dead at his vacation home on the @entity7 coast			1
his killers have never been identified , although the @entity7 blame @entity170			0
@entity7 's long - term alliance with @entity172 and its sponsorship of the @entity163 militia in neighboring @entity115 are also sensitive issues at home			1
some reports from @entity52 say protesters have raised their voices against both			0
@entity7 officials quoted in @entity93 cables say @entity163 is a legitimate resistance movement and part of the overall @entity186 peace process			2
in other words -- @entity7 's ( and @entity172 's ) insurance card against @entity170			2
in 2009 , the top @entity93 diplomat in @entity161 sharply criticized @entity7 's alleged delivery of ballistic missiles to @entity163			2
" @entity7 's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by @entity163 could prove disastrous for @entity7 and the broader region , " he wrote			2
other cables suggest constant juggling by @entity1 as he tries to keep the alliance with @entity172 intact while not closing the door to negotiations with @entity170			1
@entity202 at the @entity203 says @entity7 is a critical regional player			0
" instability in @entity7 means there will be instability in @entity115 , which is a divided country along sectarian lines			0
" @entity172 , too , would be affected were @entity1 to go , he said : " @entity7 is a critical player that supports a @entity212 state			1
the @entity213 has tried to wean @entity7 off @entity172 but has failed			0
" @entity214 , a research fellow with the @entity215 in @entity216 , agrees that events in @entity7 could alter the @entity186 landscape			0
" a liberal democratic @entity7 would be more susceptible to peace with @entity170 , irrespective of the status of the @entity221 , " he said			0
" in light of the opposition that removed @entity225 , it is questionable whether peace can be made with autocratic leaders that can be removed and not with liberal societies			2
" @entity214 says the violence so far does not threaten the regime 's existence but " will embolden the majority - @entity233 population and @entity235 minority , who deeply resent the political dominance of the @entity239 minority , to protest			1
" @entity240 is an @entity239			0
but so far , none of @entity7 's major cities has seen the sort of unrest witnessed in @entity52			2
some @entity7 - watchers say @entity1 may even turn the crisis to his advantage by pushing through reform despite the hardliners and bureaucratic inertia			1
he may also benefit from a fractured opposition			2
@entity7 analyst @entity252 at @entity253 says that civil society has been stifled by decades of emergency rule			0
" the protesters are not organized			0
the opposition is fragmented , " he said			0
" civil society is not developed enough to be a counterweight to the state " even if intellectuals leading the opposition enjoy a certain amount of moral authority			0
other analysts say the sudden announcement of extensive concessions smacks of panic , and that endemic corruption and high unemployment are beyond the government 's capacity to fix			1
in addition , as the @entity72 notes , " as a result of events elsewhere in the region , a new awareness and audacity have materialized over the past several weeks in myriad forms of rebelliousness			1
" fear , if not gone , is no longer so pervasive			0
the @entity72 says much hinges on @entity1 , who is due to address the nation in the next couple of days			1
" he alone can prove that change is possible and already in the making , restore some sense of clarity and direction to a bewildered power apparatus and put forward a detailed framework for structural change , " it says			0
as @entity1 also told the @entity3 in january : " this is the @entity186 , where every week you have something new			1

despite concern , @entity1 forced to react to opposition
the regime 's carrot - and - stick approach may work in the short term
in the long term , there is risk in any *strategy* , the @entity72 says
@entity94 cables show a government hamstrung by internal disagreement
