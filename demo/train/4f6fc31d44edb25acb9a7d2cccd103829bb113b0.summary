@entity1 opposition leader @entity0 says the captain of @entity3 is a card - carrying member of his party -- and an extremely distant relative -- but he dismissed suggestions the pilot may have diverted the plane as a political act in his support			1
hours before the @entity11 flight vanished en route to @entity13 on march 8 , @entity0 , de facto leader of the @entity15 , was sentenced to five years in jail after a court overturned his 2012 acquittal on a sodomy charge			1
some media outlets have reported that the plane 's pilot , @entity21 , had attended the court hearing , and speculated that the flight 's disappearance may have been a political act in response to the verdict			1
as authorities increasingly focused their attentions on events in the cockpit , the homes of @entity21 and first officer @entity3 were searched , and a homemade flight simulator found in @entity21 's home , @entity1 officials revealed			1
. @entity0 , who is free pending appeal , told @entity39 his party had been unable to establish whether @entity21 had been in attendance at court , although a number of his friends had reported he had been " upset and disgusted " by the outcome			2
the opposition leader recognized photographs of @entity21 from political meetings , and subsequently established he was a member of his party -- and a distant relative of his daughter - in - law			1
however , he labeled the suggestion that @entity21 could have steered the airliner from its designated flight path as a political act as " grossly unfair " to the missing pilot			0
watch : politics of @entity3 pilot questioned he alleged that the speculation had only gained traction as a result of the government trying to deflect attention from its " incompetent " handling of the crisis			1
" i think there 's a desperation by the government of the ruling leadership over the manner they managed the whole crisis			0
clearly incompetent , contradictory statements , poor management of the crisis , " he said			2
" in order to deflect that , their own failure , their own incompetence , they now choose to attack me , " he said			0
" they fail on every count ... they 're now desperate to cast aspersions against me as leader of the opposition			2
" @entity1 political scientist @entity82 said that while close scrutiny of the potential motivations of anyone onboard is warranted , he believes the speculated link to @entity1 domestic politics was a " red herring			2
" " had the captain intended to cause this incident in protest , there should be clearly some clue			0
it 's pointless to make a political statement in silence , that leaves everyone guessing where you are going , " he said , adding that such drastic actions would be unprecedented in @entity1 politics			0
he had seen no evidence to back up @entity0 's claim that the theory had been promulgated by @entity1 authorities to distract from their handling of the crisis , but said that such an explanation was " very possible			1
" " you have a one - party state run by princelings that demonstrates very poor leadership and very chaotic coordination -- poor leadership and chaotic coordination that has been distracted from by this red herring , " he said			0
@entity1 government officials declined to respond to @entity0 's comments			2
@entity0 has repeatedly said he is innocent of a charge he sodomized a former aide , calling the case against him an attempt by the government to end his political career			0
the @entity1 government has consistently denied his accusations			0
when asked at a news conference tuesday about the @entity0 angle , @entity1 's transport minister @entity129 said that the issue was above politics , and that speculation linking the plane 's disappearance to @entity0 's sentencing had come from foreign media , not by his government			1
