-- @entity1 says he asked @entity2 about how to build a high - quality team and great products , but denies @entity5 and @entity6 ever talked about an acquisition			1
the revelations come as part of an in - depth interview between @entity12 's @entity11 and @entity6 founder @entity1 and coo @entity13			1
the extensive interview covers all of the bases , such as whether @entity6 will ever build games ( no , @entity1 says ) and what @entity1 thinks of @entity18 ( he calls it " their own little version of @entity6 " )			1
however , the most interesting part of the interview comes when the trio starts discussing @entity1 's relationship with @entity2			2
" i had a lot of questions for him on how to build a team around you , " he says in response to one of @entity28 's questions			2
" that 's focused on building as high quality and good things as you are			0
how to keep an organization focused , right , when i think the tendency for larger companies is to try to fray and go into all these different areas			0
" @entity1 professes respect for @entity5 because , like @entity6 , it is out to build a company that will change the world rather than fatten the bottom line			1
@entity28 then asks @entity1 whether or not the two companies had ever talked about an acquisition			2
" no. i do n't think it ever really got there , " he says			0
" i mean , nor would i have wanted to sell it			0
" @entity13 and @entity1 then start talking about how @entity2 never raised the issue because he understood that @entity1 had no interest in selling			1
we here at @entity0 have heard conflicting stories about whether @entity5 has ever tried to acquire @entity6 , but we find it hard to believe the two companies never talked about the issue at some level , whether seriously or just in passing			1
@entity13 ends the interview with a strong message for women			2
" if you survey men and women in college today in this country , the men are more ambitious than the women , " she says			0
" and until women are as ambitious as men , they 're not going to achieve as much as men			0
