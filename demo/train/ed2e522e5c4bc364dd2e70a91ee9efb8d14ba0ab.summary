-- i drive a @entity2			1
it 's a 4 - cylinder , the seats are cloth , and the window sills are permanently caked with dog drool			1
which always works out rather well for the guys at the car wash who regularly enjoy the financial benefits of my shame			1
" sir , did something explode ? " " here , just take all my money			2
" but this less - than - spectacular , mid-sized suv certainly gets the job done			1
so long as the job does n't call for impressing exotic , beautiful women			2
for that i rely on my bald head and lush , ginger beard			0
all this is to say that i 'm a simple man , and at the end of the day my car just needs to do one thing : get me from @entity29 to point @entity30 and preferably without the accelerator getting dangerously stuck at 125 mph on the highway			1
because that 's exactly what happened to some poor guy in @entity36 who recently had the craziest ride of his life			1
it was a popular trending story online that quickly made its way across the @entity41 , detailing how @entity42 casually drove off from his home in @entity44 for a weekly routine trip to the supermarket			1
then , suddenly , the speed control on his @entity48 -- which was specially modified for a disabled driver -- jammed at 60 mph			1
this , of course , being in @entity51 , was actually displayed on his dash in kilometers			0
however , my brain ca n't handle such a thing , as it requires both math and a basic understanding of the number 10			0
nevertheless , in a panic , the terrified 36 - year - old attempted to use the brakes			2
but the more he tried to stop the vehicle , the faster it went , eventually topping out at 125 mph			1
that is a truly sensational speed that i could never expect out of my own stupid car unless it somehow managed to free - fall from the @entity72			1
but @entity42 was evidently going that fast , completely out of control , with no way to stop			2
and before you rattle off your brilliant solutions , let 's at least give him the benefit of the doubt that he unsuccessfully attempted to turn off the ignition and / or drop it into neutral			2
yet , somehow , despite miraculously keeping control of his car , @entity82 also managed to multitask and make an emergency call from his mobile phone			1
" so , uh , what are you wearing ? " soon , several police cruisers caught up to the runaway car to escort it through traffic , and later assist with three toll plazas where they called ahead to have the gates raised			1
all things considered , it must have at least been nice to be king for a day			0
emergency services even patched him through to an expert engineer at @entity103 who tried to help			0
have you tried using the brakes ? " " go to hell			0
" incredibly , their only hope was for @entity82 to eventually run out of gas			0
and that 's where this story gets truly amazing			2
because it took a while			0
about 125 miles and one country later , just over the @entity36 border into @entity118 , his car finally sputtered dry and crashed into a ditch			1
which actually seems like a rather unnecessary ending after you 've already managed to safely avoid tragedy while traversing the entire northern coast of @entity36			1
" @entity126 , might as well dump this thing into a hole			0
" @entity42 later recounted the seemingly endless horror to the @entity131 newspaper , describing his emotions during the harrowing journey			0
" my life flashed before me , " he said			0
" i just wanted it to stop			0
" and so it did			0
though the @entity140 's @entity139 newspaper reports that while @entity42 was n't injured , he did suffer two epileptic seizures			1
not that we 're keeping score , but surely that ought to count			0
regardless , everything more or less worked out in the end , and at least he never went flying off a cliff			0
for @entity82 adhered to the most basic rule of driving : the tires are the things on your car that make contact with the road			2
and sometimes , just for fun ... with a ditch in @entity118 .			0

" @entity162 " is @entity160 's weekly , *offbeat* look at trending topics online
this week , @entity164 looks at a 125 mph , out - of - control car ride
the @entity36 driver maintained control , despite two seizures and two toll *booths*
he clearly should have had a 4 - cylinder @entity2 -- no 125 mph here
