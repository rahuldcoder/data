" @entity6 , " @entity9 's film about @entity11 marksman @entity10 , stunned just about everyone by earning $ 107 million over its first weekend in wide release -- an unprecedented haul for a downbeat , r - rated drama released in the middle of winter			1
the movie is drawing huge crowds across the moviegoing and political spectrum , from left - leaning cities to conservative small towns			1
its audiences include large percentages of women and older viewers , two groups that do n't typically flock to the multiplex			2
" @entity6 " has the look of a bona fide cultural phenomenon			1
all of which has @entity30 executives , and a lot of other people , scrambling to understand why			2
the movie has no doubt benefited from good timing : it hit 3,500 theaters the day after nabbing six @entity38 nominations , including best picture			1
but @entity38 love does n't always translate to popular success -- " the @entity42 , " the 2009 best picture winner about a @entity46 bomb - disposal team in @entity47 , earned only $ 17 million in @entity48 over its entire run			1
and until now , audiences have mostly stayed away from films about the unpopular wars in @entity47 and @entity53			2
so why has " @entity6 " -- distributed by @entity54 , which is owned by @entity55 , the parent company of @entity7 -- struck a chord when so many other modern - day war movies have not ? here are five reasons : we 're finally ready for a movie about the @entity61 it 's been three years since the @entity64 involvement in @entity47 formally ended , and we have some distance on it			1
with the vast majority of @entity64 troops out of harm 's way , audiences may finally be receptive to a movie that no longer hits too close to home			1
we saw a similar pattern after the @entity75 in the 1970s			2
although @entity30 movies about that war were made while it was still being fought , the most acclaimed @entity77 war dramas -- " @entity78 , " " @entity79 , " " @entity80 " -- began hitting @entity64 theaters three to four years after the 1975 fall of @entity85			1
wrote @entity47 veteran and film producer @entity86 , in a recent column for @entity89 : " @entity90 is tired of hearing about @entity47			2
but now , they 're at least open to being entertained by it			2
" it 's about someone many view as a hero while characters in other recent combat movies such as " @entity100 " have been loosely based on actual people , " @entity6 " is based on a firsthand account by a @entity11 seal who served four tours in @entity47			1
@entity10 was already a legend in military circles thanks to his 160 confirmed kills ( he said he had many more unconfirmed , or unwitnessed ones )			2
his 2012 memoir , " @entity6 : the @entity110 in @entity111 , " spent months on the best - seller lists			1
as portrayed by @entity112 in the movie , @entity10 was about as stereotypically @entity64 as they come : a @entity116 - fearing good ol ' boy from @entity118 who loved hunting , rodeos , his family and his country			1
after @entity10 died in 2013 , thousands filled @entity125 outside @entity126 for a memorial service			2
his funeral procession stretched for 200 miles			0
" most of the conversation about what happened with our country in @entity47 is negative			0
this ( movie ) is a positive portrayal , " said @entity7 senior media correspondent @entity133			1
" this is a film with an @entity64 hero			1
" however , some critics on the left have questioned whether @entity30 is lionizing a bloodthirsty soldier who called @entity47 " savages " and wrote in his book that his " only regret is that i did n't kill more			0
" @entity145 's attack on ' @entity146 ' it 's got a great trailer for weeks , audiences have been seeing a riveting trailer for the movie that shows @entity112 as @entity10 , his rifle and scope trained on two @entity47 civilians in @entity155 who may or may not be trying to bomb a @entity64 military convoy			1
" i 've got a woman and a kid , 200 yards out , moving towards the convoy			0
she 's got a grenade ... she handed it to the kid , " he says into his radio , his finger closing on the trigger			0
" your call , " comes the reply from the radio			0
the tense scene is intercut with flashbacks from @entity10 's life back home in @entity118 , including his wedding and the birth of a child			0
then we 're back to the @entity47 street and @entity10 's split - second dilemma			0
" they fry you if you 're wrong , " his fellow soldier tells him as @entity10 stares down the crosshairs			0
we can hear his breathing			0
we hear music swelling ominously			0
we see the kid start running towards the @entity64 troops			1
we do n't know what happens next , but we want to find out			0
it 's a human story , not a political one " @entity6 " has no grandstanding politicians or speeches about the folly of war			1
it 's just @entity10 's story , from before basic training to after he returns home for good			1
" it does n't deal with whether we should have been there , or what we were doing there , " said @entity7 's @entity133			0
" it only deals with the reality of what it was like for one soldier once he was there			0
so it 's a soldier 's - eye point of view			0
" people with opposing opinions on the war might all find evidence in the movie to support their views			2
military hawks could see the @entity47 , who are portrayed in the film almost entirely as insurgents bent on killing @entity64 , as evildoers who must be snuffed out			1
opponents of the conflict might see its effects on @entity112 's character , who becomes jittery and withdrawn , as further proof of the corrosive effects of the war on returning soldiers			0
still , almost everything can be politicized if you try , and " @entity6 " is no exception			1
many conservatives , upset with what they saw as the morally ambiguous , anti-military tenor of such recent @entity61 films as the @entity242 thriller " @entity243 , " have hailed " @entity6 " as a tribute to an @entity64 patriot			1
a review on right - wing website @entity248 called it a " patriotic , pro-war on terror masterpiece			0
" meanwhile , documentary filmmaker @entity252 expressed a more controversial view in a tweet that called snipers " cowards			0
" opinion : why i refuse to see ' @entity64 sniper ' it stars @entity112 one of the most popular and charismatic young actors in @entity30 , @entity112 has now been nominated for an acting @entity38 three years in a row ( after " @entity262 " and " @entity263 " )			1
to play @entity10 , he gained more than 30 pounds of muscle and mastered the seal 's @entity118 drawl			0
" @entity112 did an amazing job and i truly do n't believe there 's anybody who could have done better , " @entity267 , @entity10 's widow , told @entity7 's @entity268			0
when her late husband 's friends saw the movie , they told her " it 's eerie how much it felt like @entity10 ... it 's like the spirit of @entity10 is exuding from @entity112 as he 's playing this role			2
" so put it all together -- a likable star , a respected director , a compelling true story , strong marketing and some excellent timing -- and you get a surprise blockbuster that 's not likely to be duplicated anytime soon			2
but of course , @entity30 will try			0
@entity252 explains snipers are ' cowards ' tweet			0

" @entity6 " earned $ *105* million over its first weekend in wide release
@entity64 may be finally ready for a movie about the @entity61
adding to its appeal : the movie is a human story , not a political one
