@entity0 -- after three weeks on the ground , @entity4 's @entity3 soon will return to the skies -- but only so engineers can test the plane 's troubled electrical and battery systems , the @entity2 said thursday			1
the @entity2 approved test flights for the @entity4 planes with strict conditions to assure safety : only essential personnel will be on board , crews must continuously monitor the plane for battery - related problems and tests will be conducted over unpopulated areas			1
" these flights will be an important part of our efforts to ensure the safety of passengers and return these aircraft to service , " the agency said			1
@entity4 spokesman @entity29 said in a statement that the company is " confident " the tests could be conducted safely , and said one @entity4 aircraft has been designated for the test			1
flights are planned in the @entity36			0
although there are only @entity39 in service worldwide , the stakes are high for the world 's largest aircraft manufacturer			1
following a difficult development , @entity4 has several hundred 787s on order at roughly $ 200 million apiece			0
the @entity3 is the first commercial aircraft to have extensive use of novel lithium - ion batteries , which can hold more electrical power in a smaller , lighter space			0
dreamliner battery type requires safeguards , safety advocate says the @entity2 announcement comes on the same day the @entity55 told reporters it had identified the exact battery cell that first short - circuited on a plane in @entity59 in early january , but still had not determined the root cause of the electrical short			1
it listed among the possibilities a manufacturing flaw , a design defect or problems with external systems that charge and discharge the battery			0
the safety board also said it is placing under the microscope @entity4 's testing program , which led to the certification of the lithium - ion batteries for the plane			1
those tests apparently led the airplane builder to greatly underestimate the chances of battery failure , the safety board said			1
@entity4 had estimated a " smoke " event would occur " less than once in 10 million flight hours " with the batteries , @entity80 , the safety board 's chairman , said			1
but two batteries failed after fewer than 100,000 hours of actual flight , one leading to a fire aboard the 787 on the ground in @entity59			0
further , @entity4 's indications that heat damage in one battery cell would not harm adjacent cells proved false , @entity80 said			2
" the assumptions used to certify the battery must be reconsidered , " @entity80 said			0
@entity80 's statements cast doubt on the safety of the battery technology and the @entity2 's certification process for approving technology			1
it also appeared to dispel any hopes for a quick resolution to the problem , which has led to the grounding of the @entity3 fleet globally since jan. 16			2
the safety board plans to release an interim report of its findings within 30 days			1
@entity113 's @entity112 replaced faulty batteries on @entity3 last year the @entity2 -- the ultimate arbiter of when the plane can resume flying -- has declined to predict when the 787 will return to commercial service			1
speaking about the january 7 fire in @entity59 , @entity80 said the plane 's flight data recorder showed the battery underwent an unexplained drop in voltage from 32 volts to 28 immediately before the incident , as the plane was being serviced on the tarmac			1
the voltage drop was consistent with the charge of a single cell on the eight - cell battery , she said			0
@entity80 said investigators believe the problem originated in cell six , which shows multiple signs of a short circuit -- an unintended path of electricity			2
the short circuit resulted in a thermal runaway -- a chemical chain reaction -- in cell six , which spread to adjacent cells			0
" charred battery components indicated that the temperature inside the battery case exceeded 500 degrees , " @entity80 said			0
but investigators still do n't know what caused cell six to short - circuit in the first place			0
they have ruled out two possibilities -- mechanical " impact " damage , like that caused by being dropped , or short - circuiting outside the battery			0
but several other possibilities are being explored , including contamination or defect during manufacturing , flaws in the design or construction of the battery , and problems with battery charging			0
that final possibility -- battery charging -- leaves open the possibility that the problem could reside outside the battery itself			2
when the @entity2 approved the use of the lithium - ion batteries on the @entity3 , it imposed nine " special conditions " that were designed to prevent or mitigate problems			2
in a joint statement on thursday , transportation secretary @entity178 and @entity2 administrator @entity179 reiterated that they are determined to fix the problem			1
" based on what information our experts find , the @entity2 will take any action necessary to further ensure safety			1
we must finish this work before reaching conclusions about what changes or improvements the @entity2 should make going forward , " the statement read			2
" the @entity2 is focused on the review and activities to understand the root cause			2
once the review is complete , the @entity2 will make any analysis and conclusions public			0
" @entity4 said it has hundreds of experts focused on solving the battery situation			0
" we are working this issue tirelessly in cooperation with our customers and the appropriate regulatory and investigative authorities			0
" what 's wrong with the @entity3 ? @entity1 's @entity204 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 authorizes dreamliner test flights as part of effort to address electrical problem
*boeing* " confident " flight tests can be performed safely
safety board investigators *intensify* *scrutiny* of tests that led to battery approval
dreamliners grounded in january ; plane is big bet for world 's largest plane manufacturer
