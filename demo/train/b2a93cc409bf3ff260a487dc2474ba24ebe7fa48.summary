-- in july 2011 , my husband and i traveled to a @entity4 orphanage to meet a 2 - year - old girl			1
we petitioned the @entity4 courts to adopt her , and waited 14 agonizing months to be granted a court date , all along fearing we would never be able to bring her home			1
now , 46 families are stuck in that nightmare of waiting for an indefinite amount of time			0
@entity4 has banned @entity16 from adopting @entity4 orphans			1
these families , like ours , left their @entity4 children holding small albums with photos of their soon - to - be families			1
and now those children have nothing more than a broken promise			0
@entity4 's adoption ban was passed in retaliation for the @entity16 ' passage of the @entity29 , a human rights bill targeting @entity4 officials			1
but while it is designed to hit @entity16 in the heart , it also condemns thousands of @entity4 orphans who could have found families in @entity16			1
orphanages , even the good ones , are institutions			1
they are no substitutes for parents			0
children who grow up in institutions experience poor physical , cognitive and emotional health and are more likely to end up in poverty , experience drug abuse , or commit suicide			1
orphaned children have suffered already ; the adoption ban ensures they will suffer more			2
institutionalized children need families , not staff			2
when children become wards of the state , they need the government to find adoptive families , in their home country or failing that , internationally			1
many @entity16 want to bring @entity4 orphans into their families , but years of political maneuvering have made it harder and harder			1
legal changes have also contributed to a steady decline in the number of @entity4 orphans adopted by @entity16			1
we experienced many of the changes during our adoption process			0
not all of them are bad			0
many of the procedures are clearly intended to protect the children			0
however , some of the changes made it more challenging for families willing to jump through the hoops of two governments			0
there 's more uncertainty involved , and the length of time to complete an adoption has increased , as well as the costs			0
our daughter , @entity87 , spent a needless year waiting to come home			0
when other adopted children were picked up by their families , she would take out her photo of the three of us and ask her caregivers where her mama and papa were			2
less than a decade ago , 4,000 to 5,000 @entity4 children found adoptive families in @entity16 each year			1
in 2011 , the number dropped to 970			0
the steep decline in international adoptions from @entity4 , along with the recent ban , is a step in the wrong direction			1
it is easy to understand why international adoption is a hot - button issue for many countries			0
it can feel shameful for a government to require international charity to solve its own problems			0
but even countries like the @entity16 allow for intercountry adoption			2
ultimately , the goal should be to find adoptive families for orphans , and sometimes those families can not be found in the child 's home country			1
mother to mother : an adoptive mom 's plea to first lady @entity124 my husband and i returned to @entity4 for a third time in october 2012 to bring @entity87 -- then 3 Â½ years old -- home			2
our daughter was well cared for by the good people in her orphanage for 912 days			0
but the lack of love and care that can be provided by a nurturing family impacted her emotionally and physically			0
during our first week as a family , @entity87 gave us the most confused looks when we tried to hold her , tickle her , or otherwise play with her			0
two months later , though she still struggled to make sense of her story , she sought us out for snuggles and gradually started to like being chased , tickled , hugged and loved			0
@entity87 's 912 days of delayed growth are disappearing			0
but children who remain in orphanages never overcome these delays			2
children living in orphan institutions need world leaders who do not use them as political pawns , but rather work to protect them			1
@entity4 's adoption ban must be lifted			1
it punishes thousands of children whose only chance of finding an adoptive family is through international adoption			2
@entity4 should start by making good on its promise to the 46 families who are left in limbo			1
these children are waiting to go home , waiting for what every child deserves -- a loving family			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity166 : world leaders should not use children as political pawns
