-- @entity1 is unlikely to win an @entity3 medal , and he will do well to even finish his event , but his story is surely one of the most inspirational in the history of the @entity8			1
in april 1994 , when he was just seven , @entity1 's family became victims of the brutal genocide in @entity12 which left nearly 800,000 people slaughtered			1
he fled the @entity15 killers who came to his village , but six of his brothers were murdered and up to 60 of his wider family perished			0
he miraculously escaped with his mother and father , living off scraps in the countryside , almost starving to death before aid came in the form of the rebel @entity28 army from neighboring @entity29			0
" the memory of the genocide is a really hard time for me and for a lot of people in @entity12 , " he told @entity0 's human to @entity31			0
" cycling gives me the opportunity to keep my past time away and really focus on what i want to do			0
" read more : @entity12 's wooden bike riders not only did he survive one of the worst atrocities in modern history , but @entity1 has overcome the odds to carry his country 's flag at @entity48			1
he will have to wait until the final day of the @entity8 before he can actually compete , but the fact that the 25 - year - old from the small east @entity52 country has qualified for the men 's mountain bike final is an achievement in itself			1
a way forward black @entity52 competitors are few and far between in this highly technical discipline , which is dominated by riders from the traditional powerhouses of cycling in @entity62			0
lack of specialist equipment and top - class competition are almost insurmountable barriers to even the most physically gifted athlete such as @entity1 , but by finishing fourth in last year 's @entity68 he booked his place on the starting line at @entity71			1
as he grew up , initially encouraged by his uncle @entity72 , who lent him an old steel bike , @entity1 used cycling as an escape from the realities of his past			1
but youthful enthusiasm can only take you so far in any sport , particularly from a war - ravaged country with little competitive structure			0
@entity1 's life changed when he was noticed by a trio of top international riders who came to @entity12 to help with a local race : @entity87 , the the first @entity89 cyclist to compete in the @entity90 in 1981 ; fellow international competitor @entity91 ; and @entity94 mountain bike legend @entity92			1
they all spotted @entity1 's raw talent and set about giving him the chance to achieve his potential			1
see also : from war child to @entity89 @entity3 star @entity12 @entity87 returned , having secured some funding in the @entity89 and backing from cycling 's world governing body , the @entity106			0
his goal was to set up @entity12 and , based in @entity108 , in the north east of the country , he tested young prospects for their physical capabilities			0
as @entity87 remembers , @entity1 stood out from the rest			2
" he tested higher than than anyone , but his whole demeanor was different , really dedicated to what he wanted to do , " @entity87 told @entity0			0
the veteran retired pro and young hopeful even raced together in the 2007 @entity121 -- the @entity90 of mountain bike racing -- and finished a creditable 33rd overall and top @entity124 pair			1
yet @entity1 and his teammates were concerned that @entity87 and other helpers would eventually leave them			2
" ' how long is this going to last ? ' they asked me			0
in a country like @entity12 they were well used to aid projects which lasted for about six months and then departed			0
" but @entity87 stayed , helping @entity1 to achieve his potential in a professional team			2
professional contract he contacted @entity136 , the boss of @entity138 's @entity137 and after a trial @entity1 was signed in 2008			1
what followed has been the stuff of dreams , and in 2009 @entity1 became the first black @entity52 to compete in a professional peloton when the team raced in the @entity145			1
not only that , he was introduced to seven - time @entity90 champion @entity146 , who was also in the stage race that year as he returned from his first retirement			2
@entity1 quickly realized that although @entity146 was a legend , the @entity89 was still flesh and blood like everyone else			2
" when i saw him on the news , i thought @entity146 was a big , big man ! " he recalled			0
" but when i saw him face to face , he was quite small ! " @entity1 has excelled in road racing and individual time trialing against the clock , but cross-country mountain biking offered him the best chance of @entity3 qualification			1
after gaining his spot , he has been honing his skills with @entity92 in @entity94 , staying at the former world champion 's home			0
" his technical skills were poor but he was very strong , " said @entity92			0
at the @entity48 , seeded riders start in the front rank , giving them a massive advantage on the narrow and highly technical course			2
@entity3 goal for riders like @entity1 , who will be starting towards the back , the aim of the game is to avoid being lapped and therefore eliminated , which is no easy task			2
" we have one big goal : to actually finish the race , " @entity92 confided			0
" he can only afford to be about 10 minutes behind the leader , but i have some hope he can actually do it			0
he has developed his skills a lot			0
" so no @entity3 glory , just survival , but @entity1 's life has been all about just that and his efforts will hopefully inspire a generation of cyclists from his country			1
@entity87 has no doubt of that			0
" each country always has a hero and @entity1 for @entity12 is the ignition point , the spark that is going to get kids into cycling , " he said			0
longer term , @entity87 believes @entity1 can prosper in the professional peloton and one day ride the @entity90 with @entity200 , which wants to acquire a higher @entity106 pro continental team status next year			1
" they have a two - year plan to achieve it , " @entity87 said			1
flag bearer @entity200 has signed 20 - year - old @entity206 @entity205 , as well as two @entity208 riders , @entity209 and @entity210 , so it is not inconceivable there could be sizable @entity52 representation in the greatest cycling race in the world			1
given @entity1 's tragic past , it would complete a remarkable journey for him -- and if sheer determination was the only factor , he will surely take his place			2
" i will never give up , i will try my best , " is @entity1 's racing philosophy			2
he will be putting it to the test against the best mountain bikers in the world as the @entity48 come to a climax on sunday			1
having already carried @entity12 's flag at the opening ceremony , @entity1 knows that the hopes and dreams of his nation rest on his slim shoulders -- and he will surely not let them down .			1

@entity1 carried @entity124 flag at opening ceremony of @entity48
six of his brothers were killed in the @entity239 of 1994
the 25 - year - old will compete in the men 's mountain bike final on sunday
he has received *coaching* from mountain bike great @entity248
