-- author @entity3 , regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific writers in modern @entity7 letters , died tuesday , his publicist said			1
@entity3 won many literary awards			1
his books , such as " @entity10 , " were also best - sellers			1
@entity3 passed away tuesday morning after battling lung cancer			1
he lived in @entity13 , @entity14			2
" he was one of our greatest writers , and he will be sorely missed , " said @entity15 , vice president of publicity at @entity3 's publisher , @entity17			1
@entity3 was a rarity among @entity7 writers : a much - esteemed , prize - winning author whose books -- including " @entity25 " ( 1960 ) , " @entity26 " ( 1968 ) , " @entity10 " ( 1984 ) and " terrorist " ( 2006 ) -- were also best - sellers			1
@entity3 won the @entity29 twice : for " @entity32 " ( 1981 ) and its successor , " @entity31 " ( 1991 )			1
@entity33 : share your tributes to @entity3 the " rabbit " series , about an angst - ridden car dealer in a town much like @entity3 's hometown of @entity41 , @entity42 , spanned four novels , a novella and four decades			1
in the books -- which also included 1971 's " @entity47 " and a 2001 novella , " @entity49 " -- onetime basketball star @entity50 negotiates marriage , divorce , wealth and health problems , never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life			2
" @entity25 is not a character calculated to inspire affection , but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of @entity7 manhood , and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking , " wrote @entity64 's @entity63 in naming " @entity25 " to @entity64 's " @entity66 " list			1
@entity3 was incredibly prolific , penning essays , reviews , short stories , poetry and memoirs			1
his works frequently appeared in @entity76 , including a famed 1960 essay about @entity79 ' final game , " @entity80			2
" " no writer was more important to the soul of @entity76 than @entity3 , " said @entity81 , the editor of the magazine , in a statement			1
" even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine , loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young			2
" we adored him , " @entity81 continued			0
" he was , for so long , the spirit of @entity76 and it is very hard to imagine things without him			0
" the magazine said that @entity3 had written 862 pieces for it over the years , including 327 book reviews , 170 short stories and 154 poems			1
he was well - regarded in his adopted home state of @entity14			0
" @entity3 's place among @entity7 's literary greats is forever secure , as is his special place in every @entity114 fan 's heart for his magnificent ' @entity80 , ' " sen. @entity106 ( @entity107 ) said in a statement			1
" we honor his memory and his contributions , and @entity14 today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own			0
" @entity3 never won a @entity119 , but one of his characters , @entity120 , received one in " @entity123 " ( 1998 )			1
his works , particularly given their sexual content , could be as divisive as they were poetic			0
many critics accused him of misogyny , and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and @entity3 put out his prose by the ream			1
" it seems to be easier for @entity3 to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book , " the literary critic @entity133 wrote in the @entity134 in 2001			1
but his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers , the cover of @entity142 ( for 1968 's " @entity26 " ) and a lifetime achievement @entity144 in @entity145 from @entity147 's @entity146			0
he was criticized by @entity148 , hailed by fellow author ( and @entity3 obsessive ) @entity150 in " @entity151 " and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a " @entity158 " episode as the ghostwriter of a @entity155 the @entity157 book			1
" [ @entity159 ] was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of @entity163 , " @entity3 said , noting that the hardest part of his performance was " producing a chuckle			1
" @entity3 was born march 18 , 1932 , in @entity167 , @entity42 , and grew up in @entity41			1
from an early age he took to reading and writing , and earned a full scholarship to @entity172 , where he headed the @entity173			0
upon graduation , he accepted a one - year fellowship to @entity176 in @entity177			0
by the time he was 23 , he had been offered a position at @entity76 , which was to become his literary home over the next 50 - plus years			0
@entity3 's first novel , " @entity180 , " came out in 1959			1
the next year , in " @entity25 , " he introduced @entity50 , who was to become one of the most famous characters in @entity7 fiction			1
when introduced , @entity25 is a man fleeing his pregnant wife , the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life			0
over the course of the " rabbit " books , the character would routinely infuriate his spouse , mistresses and offspring , try to make things right , and never quite succeed			1
his attitude did n't help			0
" men are all heart and women are all body			0
i do n't know who has the brains			0
@entity206 maybe , " the character said in " @entity25			0
" " @entity25 " was successful , as were @entity3 's other ' 60s books , including " @entity208 " ( 1963 ) , which featured a teacher much like @entity3 's father , and the short story collection " @entity212 " ( 1966 )			1
but it was " couples " that made @entity3 a household name			1
the book , about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban @entity14 , became a no. 1 best - seller			0
@entity3 's interests ranged widely			2
he wrote about an @entity224 state in " @entity225 " ( 1978 )			0
he discussed the relationship between science and religion in " @entity229 " ( 1986 )			0
he revisited " @entity231 " in " @entity230 " ( 2000 )			0
and he created a group of promiscuous witches in " @entity10 " ( 1984 ) , which became a hit movie in 1987 starring @entity235 as the devil			2
though @entity3 's work routinely sold well , he was painfully aware of the decline of what 's come to be called " literary fiction			2
" in a 2000 interview with @entity242 , he lamented its difficulties			0
" when i was a boy , the best - selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher 's shelf			2
i mean , @entity248 , @entity249 , some @entity250			0
@entity250 actually had , considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are , quite a middle - class readership , " he said			0
" but certainly someone like @entity248 was a best - seller as well as a @entity119 - winning author of high intent			2
you do n't feel that now			0
" and yet , @entity3 himself never lost his zest for the written word , and the pleasure brought by jotting , tuning , refining -- creating -- a new story , even as the years drifted by			2
" an aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that , as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them , will outlast him for a while , " he wrote in @entity265 late last year			2
" the pleasures , for him , of book - making ... remain , and retain creation 's giddy bliss			0
among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best			0
" @entity3 's most recent novel , " @entity281 , " came out in 2008			2
a collection of stories , " my father 's tears and other stories , " is due out later this year .			0
