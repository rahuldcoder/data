" @entity35 , an associate pastor at @entity36 , told @entity0 that @entity1 will not be doing interviews at this time , but plans to write a book about her experience			1
" they feel like this is a tremendous miracle that 's happened , " @entity35 said			0
" this is a long - awaited day of celebration			1
" tears shed for @entity7 on saturday , loved ones honored @entity7 's memory in @entity48 , where his mother lives			0
in a memorial service at @entity51 in @entity52 , his nephew @entity53 and others eulogized @entity7 as a kind , compassionate man			0
@entity53 said he wished @entity7 would be remembered for his acts of kindness " as opposed to the person who brought this disease to @entity9 , because he did n't know he was sick			0
" @entity7 's willingness to help others may have led to his death at age 42			0

a @entity81 spokesman later confirmed portions of the official 's information			1
the team will be under orders to deploy within 72 hours at any time over the next month , the official said			1
the @entity94 requested the military team , and the @entity81 has given verbal approval , the official said			1
the team will include five doctors , 20 nurses and five trainers , @entity81 press secretary rear adm. @entity97 said in a statement			1
the @entity81 has been working to determine what assistance it could offer the civilian health care sector following a @entity106 meeting last week during which president @entity107 said he wanted a more aggressive response , according to two defense officials			1
defense secretary @entity110 ordered chief of the @entity112 , gen. @entity113 , " to prepare and train a 30 - person expeditionary medical support team that could , if required , provide short - notice assistance to civilian medical professionals in the @entity9 , " @entity97 said			1

@entity133 passenger cleared sunday 's news out of the @entity81 came as a cruise ship plowed through the waters of a @entity120 port with precious cargo on board -- the end of a small @entity8 scare			1
a passenger had been loosely linked to the only patient to die from the disease in the @entity9 , but health authorities cleared her after an odyssey at sea			0
after voluntarily isolating herself in her cabin , she remained symptom - free , and her lab tests looked good , the @entity148 said			1
she and a travel partner were allowed to disembark			0
the drama goes back to the woman 's work as a lab supervisor at @entity157 in @entity158 , the center of a maelstrom of @entity8 fears in the @entity9			2
it 's where @entity66 patient @entity7 was misdiagnosed and later died , and where two nurses became the first people to contract @entity8 in @entity9			0
seventy - five health workers and 48 people in the community are under monitoring after coming into contact with @entity7			2
there are hopeful signs that some of the @entity8 contagion scare in the @entity9 could be winding down			1
of the four patients being treated , at least two appear to be making a recovery			0
and the monitoring period for the 48 community members ends at midnight sunday night , according to @entity182 judge @entity181 , who is overseeing response efforts in @entity158			2
" thankfully they are all asymptomatic , and it looks like none of them will get @entity8 , " @entity181 said , expressing hope that they would be welcomed home with no issues			0
" the community needs to reach out and envelop them in compassion and acceptance because we can not have the community stigmatizing people			0
... they have been through a terrible ordeal			0
" as for the other 75 people , they are in day 11 of 21 since @entity7 's death and @entity181 said , " today is a crucial day for them because is one of the last high - likelihood days that we will see more cases			2
" the cruise ship incident and a second travel scare came about in a bureaucratic loophole			1
in an abundance of caution to avoid any possible spread of the ebola virus , about 50 people associated with @entity157 have signed a document legally restricting where they can go until they are cleared of @entity8			2
but before the voluntary travel ban existed , the lab supervisor and a nurse , who later came down with @entity8 , went on trips and triggered hefty responses			0
the lab worker had had no direct contact with @entity7 but may have handled one of his lab specimens			0
a doctor on board the ship observed her to make sure she was symptom - free as the incubation period within which the disease would manifest itself approached its end			1
the other travel scare was set off by one of the nurses who contracted @entity8 after treating @entity7			1
before her illness was apparent , @entity235 took a @entity238 flight to @entity239 , then a flight back to @entity158			2
there were 132 people on @entity244 's flight			0
after her contagion became known , the air carrier reached out to some 800 passengers out of an abundance of caution , advising them to contact the @entity251			2
@entity238 also took the plane out of service temporarily			0
@entity254 , head of the @entity255 , told @entity0 on sunday that he did n't know much about @entity244 's condition , but he said @entity257 , the other @entity158 nurse who contracted the illness , was in fair condition and doing " fine			2
" can you catch @entity8 on a plane ? hospital apologizes on sunday , @entity157 took out a full - page newspaper ad , once again offering an apology			1
the open letter from @entity267 ceo @entity266 appeared in the sunday editions of the @entity269 and @entity270			1
" as an institution , we made mistakes in handling this very difficult challenge , " @entity266 wrote			2
the hospital is analyzing the errors and will make changes , he said			2
the turmoil started in september , when @entity7 went to the hospital with @entity8 symptoms , and health care workers initially sent him home with antibiotics			2
they recorded his travel history to @entity284 , where a raging @entity8 outbreak has killed more than 4,500 people			0
but they did n't give that detail the necessary attention , the hospital said			2
