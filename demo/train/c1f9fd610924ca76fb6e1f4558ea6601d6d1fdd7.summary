-- no advanced seat selection , no changes or refunds			1
sound like @entity4 ? nope			0
it 's @entity6 ' new " @entity11 " fare , part of the airline 's new five - fare class of pricing starting march 1			1
no longer content to just offer first - class and coach - cabin seating , @entity6 is splitting its aircraft into five fare classes			1
travelers who want more than " @entity11 " will pay more -- @entity6 's not saying yet how much more -- although that 's already the reality for many travelers			1
passengers who are willing to pay to change their flights and check their bags -- so - called ancillary fees -- helped 26 passenger @entity25 airlines turn a net profit of $ 12.7 billion in 2013 , up from a profit of $ 98 million in 2012			0
@entity6 topped that list , collecting $ 1.67 billion last year : $ 840 million in reservation change / cancellation fees and $ 833 million in baggage fees			2
@entity32 came in second place with $ 1.38 billion in fees : $ 756 million in reservation cancellation / change fees and nearly $ 625 million in baggage fees			0
@entity6 hopes its new seating options will also be profitable			0
note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum : the first - class cabin will be split into " @entity43 " for domestic routes and " @entity46 " for long - haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights			1
the " @entity43 " fare includes " first to board " rights , preflight alcoholic drinks , snacks on flights longer than 250 miles and meals on flights longer than 900 miles			2
the " @entity46 " elite first class fare includes access to @entity57 , full flat - bed seats on widebody aircraft , in - flight bedding , chef - curated menus , noise - reduction headsets and more			1
in the main cabin , customers will have choice of the " @entity11 " fare and two other fare classes			0
the " @entity11 " bare - bones coach fares will be available on domestic routes , and they 're already available in some areas where @entity6 competes with deep discounter @entity4			1
the " @entity73 " coach fares on domestic and long - haul international flights will allow seat selection at time of purchase and flexibility for flight changes			1
on long - haul international flights , the fare will include alcoholic drinks , meal service and a sleep kit			2
the " @entity85 + " coach fare on all flights will include priority boarding and dedicated overhead bin space , alcoholic drinks , premium snacks , premium entertainment , up to 4 more inches of legroom and quilted seat covers			2
travel enthusiasts are already debating the impact on the flying public			0
a three - way split in the coach question raises the question : " will these new economy fares be lower than previously , because you 're getting less ? " asked @entity102 , founder of @entity103			0
" or will you get less for the same fare ? " and who will guard that dedicated overhead bin space for " @entity85 + " travelers , @entity102 asks			0
already harried flight attendants trying to negotiate passengers in already crowded planes ? aviation journalist @entity111 argues that not much will actually change at @entity6			2
" the most interesting part of the ( announcement ) was a true definition of the new basic economy fare , which aims to directly compete with low - cost carrier spirit , " said @entity111 , @entity113 's data research manager			1
the routes the new fare is offered on are now clearly defined , but are still fairly limited			0
" travel blogger @entity121 likes the simplified fare benefits chart but is troubled by that basic fare			0
" the lowest fare class does n't allow advanced seat selection ? " @entity121 asked			1
" for some people , that might not be a big deal , but for a frequent flier who studies seat maps to choose the best seat on the plane , that 's a deal - breaker for me			2
that pricing structure seems spirit-esque			0

@entity6 's new fare structure will offer five in - flight experiences
the bare - bones economy fare does n't include advance seat selection or allow changes
the *fanciest* first - class fare includes access to airline *lounge* and chef - curated menus
the plan takes *effect* march 1
