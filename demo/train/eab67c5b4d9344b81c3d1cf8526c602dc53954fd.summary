@entity0 , the newly - inaugurated president of @entity1 , may be as notable for what he has not done as for what he has			1
he has never held national elective office despite being at the center of @entity1 politics for more than a decade , and he has never been married despite a three - decade relationship and four children with @entity9 , another of the country 's top @entity11 politicians			1
@entity0 led the @entity13 for 11 years and was leader when @entity9 ran unsuccessfully for president against @entity16 in 2007			1
@entity0 and @entity17 split up a month before that election , and he is now seeing journalist @entity19 , who appeared , smiling with him , as he celebrated his victory sunday			1
he immediately spooked markets , and @entity22 , @entity1 's key ally in the @entity24 , with his victory speech			1
" austerity can no longer be something that is inevitable , " he said , apparently undercutting the belt - tightening that his predecessor and @entity22 chancellor @entity28 have urged on @entity30 countries beset by debt			1
@entity0 emerged as his party 's candidate for president after the downfall of @entity38 , who was once considered the @entity11 favorite to defeat @entity16			1
but @entity38 was arrested in may 2011 after a @entity41 hotel maid alleged that he tried to rape her			2
charges against the former @entity44 chief were later dropped in the @entity45 , but he has been warned he could be investigated in @entity1 over accusations he participated in a prostitution ring			0
but @entity0 was not an accidental candidate despite the way he has come to power , one commentator said			1
" he 's been preparing this campaign for 18 months now , much before @entity38 's demise , " journalist @entity52 said , referring to @entity38			2
" some say that he knew , like actually many others in the party , that @entity38 was doomed : his colorful private life was always bound to prevent his running for president , " @entity58 told @entity59 before the final vote			2
" in that respect , he 's not a candidate by default			0
he 's simply a less charismatic personality than @entity38 and less antagonistic than @entity16			2
" born in 1954 in the northern city of @entity69 , @entity0 was the son of a doctor and a social worker			2
he was educated at the elite @entity72 , where he met @entity9 in 1978			0
@entity0 has represented the southern @entity74 region in parliament since 1988 but has never held higher elective office than that post			1
the 57 - year - old 's electoral appeal is built around his affability , but the candidate was dogged during the campaign by questions from even within his own party about whether he has the charisma and decisiveness to be president			2
@entity0 said : " there 's always a risk when the candidate becomes president : will he deliver what is expected of him ? " it 's a choice , it 's always an important moment for a country because it has to choose between two risks : either you keep the candidate who is on his way out or take the new candidate that we do n't know			1
" but after five years of @entity16 's hyperactive presidency , during which time @entity1 's economic status has taken a knock , polls suggested voters were keen for a change from the president 's flamboyancy			0
before the first round of voting , former president @entity114 added his support to @entity0 , though @entity114 was a center - right president , like @entity16			1
@entity114 biographer @entity118 told @entity1 tv channel @entity119 : " he said last june that he will vote for @entity0			0
... he has said it a few times since and then again 10 days ago			0
" during the campaign , @entity0 admitted that half of those who declare they will vote for him were primarily voting against @entity16			0
" what the @entity1 want is coherence , stability and justice , " @entity0 said			0
" if i am in a favorable position today , it 's because my fellow citizens want to make the effort to straighten out the country , and at the same time they want it to be just and equitable -- no one left out of national solidarity and no one left out of the contributions which must be made			0
" to his critics that sounded as if @entity0 wants to revive left - wing tax and social policies of the past , a view reinforced in the first speech of his campaign when he attacked the financial community			1
" i do n't want to drive the markets crazy , i do n't want to create trouble but rather order and rules and norms			0
we have to struggle against financial excesses ... those who speculate with sovereign debt , those who develop financial products which have done so much harm , " he said			0
but given the constraints of international finance and economic structures , observers said @entity0 will not really have room to maneuver to shift @entity1 radically to the left			0
@entity0 has been criticized for declining to spell exactly what his economic policies will be , although he has pledged to increase taxes on the rich , boost social spending and create thousands of state jobs			0
he has also vowed to renegotiate the eurozone fiscal agreement , but analysts said @entity0 will likely be a pragmatic leader			0
economy : unspoken issue in election the word one hears most often to describe @entity0 's style is " sympa , " @entity1 slang for sympathetic , but his victory also owes a great deal to @entity38 's misfortune .			1

he has never been married but has had two long - term relationships and four children
