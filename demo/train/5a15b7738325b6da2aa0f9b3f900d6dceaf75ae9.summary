essentially they 're just pieces of colored cloth , but run any of them up a pole and they become powerful talismans capable of making people behave in peculiar ways			0
the stories behind national pennants can be inspiring , intriguing and often give an insight into the culture and history of the country			1
we 're all about raising standards and we think some of the tales behind these patriotic pennants are worth saluting			0
what flags do you love and why ? leave a comment			0
@entity23 say what you like about over-polite @entity23 , at least they 've managed to ditch the @entity26 flag of their former @entity28 overlords			1
@entity23 leaders debated furiously before finally adopting the resplendent red maple leaf in 1965 , an ensign pointedly free of colonial images			1
good thing they did , because it gives @entity34 and @entity35 a useful flag to slap on their backpacks to stop people hating them			1
one original proposal , rejected by parliament , featured blue stripes and a maple trefoil that almost completely failed to resemble a cannabis leaf			1
what to say : " the @entity23 flag has saved my bacon a few times			1
" flag it up : @entity49 is birthplace of the flag			1
main attraction ? possibly the @entity34 border 15 miles away			0
@entity53 square flags are for squares			0
as the only country with an ensign that does n't have four 90 - degree corners , @entity53 is in a league of its own			1
its double triangle design symbolizes the mighty peaks of the @entity62 where foreign mountaineers have planted so many other national flags			0
the sun and moon symbols represent calmness and resolve -- character traits needed to tolerate the @entity70 - sized egos of those flag - planting foreign mountaineers			2
what to say : " @entity53 's 1962 design marked a new a pinnacle for world flags			1
" flag it up : you can plan a flag - planting exercise of your own via @entity53 's trekking agencies			1
@entity81 few flags evoke the nation they represent as well as @entity81 's			2
the blue stripes conjure the cobalt summer skies and azure seas that annually lure millions of vacationers ; the white recalls spotless coastal buildings dotting its beautiful coastline			0
the nine stripes are said to represent ancient muses or possibly the number of syllables in the battle cry " @entity96 , " meaning " freedom or death , " used in wars against the @entity100			0
what to say : " tentative signs of a recent economic recovery are a good excuse to wave the flag			2
" flag it up : on the gorgeous @entity109 islands the buildings wear the national colors with pride			1
@entity112 at first glance , @entity112 's flag appears to bear the image of a dragon on wheels			1
the reality is n't much less exciting			0
the beast in question is @entity121 , a thunder dragon of @entity112 @entity124 mythology			0
rather than riding on castors , he is in fact clutching a spherical jewel in each claw			0
as flag stories go , this one is n't bad either			2
the dragon is said to symbolize the origins of religious teachings on which @entity112 was founded			0
drukpa @entity134 was so named by its 12th - century founder , @entity135 , because he heard the thunderous sounds of dragons while hunting for a monastery site in @entity139			0
what to say : " vacations are never a drag - on this side of the @entity62			0
" flag it up : it 'll cost you a dragon 's hoard of silver to travel there , but this isolated kingdom is worth it			1
those starry spangles and candy stripes have become a teensy bit overexposed thanks to recent @entity34 ventures in overseas troublespots			0
this is a shame as the modern incarnation of @entity163 's purported creation is an oft - imitated design of which @entity34 are rightly proud			2
so proud in fact , it 's one of the only flags to have a @entity168 ( " @entity169 " ) written specifically about it			2
what to say : oh long may it wave			0
flag it up : do n't get into a flap about whether she designed it or not , just visit @entity163 's home in @entity177			1
@entity178 given @entity178 's skills on the pitch , you 'd be forgiven for thinking its flag symbolizes a blue soccer ball being booted into space from a grassy stadium			1
less excitingly , the green harks back to @entity190 colonial - era royalty , while the slice of night sky represents , even more prosaically , federal regions			0
it 's still a much - loved design , even among @entity195			2
what to say : " @entity178 's success in securing the upcoming soccer @entity199 and @entity200 justify the flag 's ' ordem e progresso ' ( order and progress ) slogan			1
" flag it up : you can take your own flag to @entity178 for next year 's soccer @entity199			1
@entity209 the simplicity of the @entity209 flag belies an interesting tale ( if true )			2
the story goes that as they were shaking off the shackles of @entity217 colonial invaders , @entity209 freedom fighters created their flag by tearing the blue strip off a @entity217 tricolor			2
another version claims the flag 's colors are derived from those representing the archipelago 's 14th century @entity226			1
either way , it excuses the fact it resembles an upside - down @entity234 flag			2
what to say : " @entity209 know how to tear a strip off oppressors			0
" flag it up : @entity241 's luxury @entity239 is supposedly the scene of the flag - tearing incident			1
@entity245 @entity245 's flag features a gun ! yes , there 's a book , symbolizing education , and , yes , there 's a hoe symbolizing agriculture			1
but there 's also an @entity256 assault rifle symbolizing the country 's bloody struggle for independence			1
the only national flag bearing a firearm , it 's the subject of intense debate in the now largely peaceful country			1
many there feel it 's time to ditch the weapon			2
what to say : " the economy is booming , not the guns			0
" flag it up : @entity245 's flag carrying @entity274 is banned in the @entity275			1
@entity276 given that it 's so widely displayed on ships using the country 's emblem as a flag of convenience , it 's fascinating to see what they almost used			1
this rather alarming alternative version , designed by @entity287 @entity286 , is meant to resemble the country 's famous canal			1
thankfully , then - president @entity290 rejected it and hired his son to produce the current ensign , adopted in 1925			0
the colors represent the country 's main political parties			1
what to say : " the alternative flag would have been a danger to shipping			2
" flag it up : you can board the @entity276 - registered @entity303 for a quiet cruise -- just you and 3,689 other passengers			2
@entity306 granted home rule from @entity308 in 1978 , @entity306 decided they needed something new to fly above their frosty territories			0
the result , adopted in 1985 , is both an exercise in classically minimalist @entity314 design , and a bold departure from other flags favored by @entity318 nations			0
many in @entity306 had hoped to emulate @entity308 and its neighbors by using a @entity323 cross -- preferably white on green -- but from 555 submitted designs , a committee instead chose a red and white split circle on a contrasting background			0
the symbolism is n't too hard to read : a red sun sinking down into snow and ice			0
what to say : " let 's hope global warming does n't necessitate a redesign			2
" flag it up : you can witness @entity306 's fantastic sunsets for yourself			1
@entity28 the @entity28 's @entity339 has long lived a double life , serving both as national emblem and an erstwhile fashion icon -- although its associations with the @entity344 are these days just as likely to bring to mind @entity346 ' underwear			0
the flag itself is an exercise in nation building , originally combining the blue and white saltire of @entity355 's patron @entity353 and the red cross on white of @entity359 's @entity358 when the two countries united in the 18th century			1
the red diagonal cross of @entity363 's @entity362 was added later			0
of course , all this could change again if @entity355 people vote for independence in a referendum scheduled for 2014			0
in which case , perhaps @entity368 might finally get a mention			0
what to say : " @entity372 , baby ! " flag it up : the @entity26 flags may not be so prominent these days , but @entity377 's @entity376 is still a swinging center for fashion			1
which flag do you think has the best design ? the most boring ? share your opinion in the comments			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity387 .			0

colors clash on @entity178 's flag , the ball of stars looks messy *...* yet somehow it works
@entity23 's maple leaf flag is one of the most *recognizable* in the world
@entity245 's flag features a gun , symbolizing the country 's struggle for independence
