-- @entity2 's seizure of @entity3 last month may have unfolded with a lightning quickness , but @entity5 and the @entity6 are now engaged in a much slower match of wits on a chessboard stretching across most of eastern @entity10			1
rather than going for checkmate , both sides now seem content to wait for the other to make a mistake			0
@entity5 made a strong first move by placing 40,000 troops on the border -- and separatists , who are not officially linked to @entity2 , on the ground in @entity10			1
now @entity21 is waiting for the @entity6 government in @entity23 to try to retake the parts of the east it has seemingly lost			1
in @entity2 's eyes , any such move from the capital would legitimize an overwhelming counterattack -- a re-run of the @entity32 crisis in 2008 , when president @entity33 lost his nerve , shot first , and prompted a @entity2 invasion			1
@entity5 's problem is time ; he can not wait forever to strike			0
troops can not remain ready for combat for many months at a time			0
separatists in eastern @entity10 are lost without outside support , and may become nervous as time drags on without any glimpse of a light at the end of the tunnel			1
on the other side of the board are @entity50 president @entity49 , @entity52 chancellor @entity51 and @entity10 's fledgling government			1
the biggest challenge for @entity49 and his @entity52 counterpart is to keep a united western front			0
they need to uphold a credible threat of massive economic sanctions that could undercut the @entity61 's funding if it does n't toe the line			0
but cracks in @entity6 unity are visible everywhere			2
@entity65 may be concerned about @entity2 aggression in @entity10 , but the continent is dragging its collective feet on taking a more confrontational stance towards @entity5			1
some nations fear @entity2 pressure , especially on their energy supply			2
many are nervous about the price their own countries will pay as a result of tougher sanctions			0
and nobody is sure yet whether they 're ready to abandon the idea of @entity2 as a vital partner			2
@entity49 , on the other hand , is much more inclined to put the squeeze on the @entity61			0
@entity83 is used to confrontation with @entity2 -- and with @entity5 , specifically -- and @entity50 is much less economically - connected with its old @entity86 rival			2
@entity50 leaders are n't motivated solely by their concern over eastern @entity65 and @entity2 reasserting itself as a more aggressive and expansionist power			1
the @entity50 also wants to assert key norms of international order -- namely territorial integrity and the principle to change borders only with the consent of all parties			0
@entity10 is also a welcome opportunity to signal to allies and rivals alike that @entity50 is not retrenching from its global engagements			0
the impact of the @entity10 crisis on @entity103 and the various territorial conflicts with its neighbors will also loom very large on the minds of policy makers in @entity83			0
but whatever the differences among @entity50 and @entity113 leaders , the more they act in concert , the better chance they have to achieve their goal : beating back @entity21 's attempt to undermine @entity10 's sovereignty and territorial integrity			2
the @entity6 also needs to make sure that @entity23 's interim government does n't lose its nerve			2
as hard as it is for leaders to watch @entity124 separatists take over their buildings , any large - scale operation in eastern @entity10 could give @entity5 the opportunity he may be waiting for : invasion with some kind of dubious pseudo-legal cover			1
it is difficult to say who is in a better position			0
@entity5 is a master tactician			0
since his years as a @entity135 agent in @entity136 in the 1980s , he has gained much expertise in finding and exploiting the @entity6 's weak spots			0
and he seems to have broad support at home for his confrontational brand of politics			0
@entity5 's weakness is his regime 's economic dependency on the @entity6			2
without the steady flow of income from the sale of gas and oil , brought under control of the @entity61 , the regime would not be able to buy support at home and to finance costly and risky foreign policy adventures			0
the @entity6 has no appetite to confront @entity2			1
but if @entity5 's tanks roll into eastern @entity10 out of the blue , without any pretense of legitimacy , he will turn @entity6 opinion even further against him			1
this could give @entity51 and @entity49 the necessary backing for tough sanctions			0
if he is to achieve his main goal , which is to prevent @entity10 from associating closer with the @entity6 , @entity5 will have to move fast			1
he probably needs to have some kind of @entity2 presence inside @entity10 ( apart from @entity3 ) , as control over separatists in the east alone might not be sufficient or sustainable			1
a full - scale crackdown by the @entity10 government on separatists would give @entity21 the cover to move some @entity2 troops as " peacekeepers " into eastern @entity10			1
once inside the country , another " frozen conflict " could be created which would destabilize the country and prevent @entity6 attempts to help @entity10 to get on its feet			1
this would keep @entity5 's longer - term ambition -- to bring @entity10 into a @entity21 - led alliance or federation -- very much alive			0
if the @entity61 comes to the conclusion that the @entity6 would n't respond to such a move with painful sanctions -- ones that would damage @entity5 's inner circle and be strong enough to sap major sources of income for the @entity61 -- @entity5 might choose to move along such lines or in other ways			2
but if the @entity50 and @entity113 demonstrate that they are truly ready to use economic warfare to counter the @entity2 military machine , the @entity6 may yet be able to deter @entity5 from going much further			1
something has to give soon			0
