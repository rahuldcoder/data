-- a @entity2 executive took to the tech giant 's official blog wednesday to take an uncharacteristically direct shot at rival @entity6			1
" seems like the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) typically generated by an @entity6 event has extended beyond @entity10 , " wrote @entity7 , @entity2 's vice president of communications			1
" so let me try to clear some things up			0
" @entity7 was referring to coverage of @entity6 's rollout of two new @entity14 -- the @entity15 and revamped @entity16 -- and other announcements			1
among them was news that the company will begin giving away its @entity22 suite of productivity apps for free			2
" now , since @entity22 has never gotten much traction , and was already priced like an afterthought , it 's hardly that surprising or significant a move , " @entity7 said			1
" so , when i see @entity6 drop the price of their struggling , lightweight productivity apps , i do n't see a shot across our bow			1
i see an attempt to play catch up			0
" @entity6 did not respond to a request for comment for this story			0
@entity7 is pressing one of @entity2 's remaining advantages over its rival			2
while @entity6 has dominated the mobile field and made strides in computer sales , @entity42 -- which includes tools like @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 -- is still viewed as the far superior productivity product by most			2
the " reality distortion field " @entity7 referenced is a catchphrase often used by @entity6 critics to describe the sometimes breathless coverage the company gets in the tech press and elsewhere for even minor announcements or upgrades to existing products			1
" perhaps attendees at @entity6 's event were required to work on @entity66 devices that do n't allow them to have two windows open for side - by - side comparisons , " he said in another dig. @entity7 went on to compare @entity2 's tablets , the @entity71 and surface 2 , favorably to the @entity16			1
he noted that the surface tablets are less expensive than comparable @entity16 models , offer more storage and come with full versions of @entity77 for free			0
but they do n't change the fact that the @entity71 has struggled to make a splash in a tablet market that the @entity16 continues to dominate			0
earlier this month , documents revealed @entity2 ceo @entity84 saw a bonus check docked because of lower than expected surface sales			0
meanwhile , at tuesday 's event , @entity6 ceo @entity87 announced that 170 million @entity14 have been sold since the device was introduced in 2010			0
he said studies show 81 % of all tablet usage happens on an @entity16 , despite recent gains by @entity93 and others making tablets running @entity98 's @entity97 operating system .			0
