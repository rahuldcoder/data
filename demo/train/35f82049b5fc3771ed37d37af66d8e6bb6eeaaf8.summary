the provision in proposed @entity8 regulations had stirred criticism from both ends of the political spectrum , from the @entity15 and from other open - government groups			2
the decision was announced in a @entity2 letter to sen. @entity19 , @entity20 , who had led the fight against the rule change			0
" we will not include that provision when the @entity2 issues final regulations , " the @entity2 said			0
in a letter to attorney general @entity25 last friday , @entity19 vowed to " take all necessary steps " to block the rule that would have allowed the government to " deceive " people about the existence of information			1
in its response , the @entity2 said the agency had in practice handled certain sensitive records as excludable since 1987 , when then - attorney general @entity37 first issued guidance saying the best way to deal with these sensitive records was to deny they existed			1
@entity37 had specifically referred to narrow categories which dealt with national - security information and requests for information relating to an ongoing criminal investigation in which the target is unaware of a probe			2
the government said it was not really " lying " to declare that " there exist no records responsive to your @entity8 request			1
" the government maintains that specific was " wholly accurate " because in these sensitive cases the only records that exist are not subject to the @entity8 act @entity19 , however , said a response that there are " no records " when such records , in fact , exist could undermine the public trust in government			1
@entity67 chairman sen. @entity66 , @entity68 , was quick to applaud the decision to drop the proposed change			0
" for five decades , the @entity8 has given life to the @entity73 value that in an open society , it is essential to carefully balance the public 's right to know and government 's need to keep some information secret , " @entity66 said			2
the @entity15 also applauded the @entity2 decision			0
" @entity85 accountability can only be assured through transparency , " said @entity82 , director of the @entity15 @entity0 legislative office			0

former attorney general @entity37 first issued guidance in 1987 on denying sensitive records exist
that came in response to @entity8 requests for *doucments*
the government said it was not really " lying " to declare " there exist no records responsive "
but the @entity2 says it is dropping a plan to allow such denials
