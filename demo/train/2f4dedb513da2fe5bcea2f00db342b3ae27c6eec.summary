-- at first , @entity1 said he felt the ground tremble			1
then the roof began to shake			1
tiles tumbled from the ceiling as people bolted from their chairs to escape			1
when @entity1 tried to follow them , he could barely keep his balance as the ground wobbled			2
" the weird thing is that afterward you will swear that it lasted 20 minutes but it really lasted 60 seconds , " @entity1 said of the earthquake tremors			1
" but at the moment , it seems like it will never stop , and it keeps getting stronger			2
" that 's how @entity1 remembers one of the most horrific moments in his life -- the 1986 earthquake in @entity24 that killed 1,500 people			1

i ca n't imagine hundreds of thousands of people going through that now			2
" for people like @entity1 , the news from @entity29 is n't abstract			2
they are people who have either survived natural disasters or respond to them			1

how disaster brings out best , worst in human nature several say disasters can reveal the worst in human nature			1
@entity60 traveled to @entity61 in the immediate aftermath of the @entity63			2
he 's also traveled to @entity64 to aid in famine relief and @entity67 after the country was decimated by genocide			2
@entity60 , who is now the director of emergency response for @entity70 , said it is critical to immediately establish security right in @entity29			2
" crime is a problem in @entity29 even in the best of times , " @entity60 said			2
" with this kind of situation , it 's going to go from bad to worse			2
" security can make the difference between life and death , @entity60 said			2
it 's not enough to deliver the right supplies to @entity29			2
someone has to guard the good samaritans			2
" you could get stopped on the road , your driver could be thrown in the ditch and you lose everything , " @entity60 said			2
people responding to the disasters often have to make excruciating choices , @entity60 said			0
in the past , aid workers would help some needy people but turn down others when they ran out of supplies			0

" people began to have hope			0
they say , ' it 's not going to last like this forever			0
' '' @entity147 : how you can help one of the most important needs for @entity29 right now is n't just food , water and medicine but something else : heavy moving equipment , @entity123 said			0
@entity123 's company has three cranes as well as infrared cameras that can spot body heat under rubble and lighting towers that illuminate the darkness			0
it might not be as obvious as delivering water , but it 's vital , he said			0
" bringing in food and water and those kind of things are great , but there 's only so much you can do with human hands , " @entity123 said			1
disasters also require leadership -- not from so far - off entity but from ordinary @entity29 in the hardest - hit areas , some said			1
during disasters , community leaders become critical , said @entity178 , director of humanitarian assistance for @entity180 , a relief agency based in @entity181 , @entity182			1
community leaders can quickly take an estimate of the damage done , their community 's needs , and start clean - up efforts			1
they give their communities a head - start , @entity178 said			0

he also saw a picture of @entity225 schoolchildren in @entity226 , @entity225 , holding their lessons outdoors in 1946 , a year after an atomic bomb had vaporized their city			1
" they 're attempting got have some semblance of normalcy in this totally surreal , devastating landscape , " @entity205 said			0
" it 's an extraordinary testament to the effort of people to go on			0
" @entity1 , the survivor of the @entity24 earthquake , has seen the same resiliency			1
after the initial quake , there is a surge of adrenalin , he said			0
