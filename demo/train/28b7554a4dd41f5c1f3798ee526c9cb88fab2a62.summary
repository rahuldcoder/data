-- on monday night , @entity0 's @entity1 had an exclusive interview with actor @entity3 , who returned from the strife - torn @entity5 region of @entity7 and just finished meeting with vice president @entity8			1
@entity3 , left , talks with vice president @entity8 at the @entity9 on monday			1
@entity1 spoke with the activist actor live from the @entity9 on the humanitarian crisis @entity3 says we must confront , along with getting a couple of tidbits about what 's next for @entity3 's acting career			1
the following is a partial transcript , edited for brevity and clarity : @entity1 : we begin with @entity3 , the @entity22 - winning actor and activist			1
he 's traveled to @entity5 at the refugee camps near the @entity7 / @entity26 border last week and met with vice president [ @entity8 ] @entity8 today			1
he 's standing , as you see , in front of the @entity9 , where it 's 12 degrees			2
and we thank him for doing this , because he 's freezing to death			2
@entity3 : i should have worn an overcoat tonight			1
@entity1 : you have no coat on ? @entity3 : no -- and no pants either ... @entity1 : well , you 've always been a little strange , @entity3			1
anyway , you met with the vice president today about @entity5			1
what did you tell him ? @entity3 : basically , we were just talking about coming back from @entity26 , right on the border of @entity5			1
and we were talking about there 's a moment coming up relatively soon , probably by the middle of next week , where the @entity45 is going to indict the president of @entity7 for war crimes , which has never happened before -- a sitting president			1
and we talked about this being an opportunity , perhaps , not just for the @entity49 , but all of us together to work with the international community in a real diplomatic effort to try and bring some sort of peace to this region			2
@entity1 : what scale of interest did @entity8 show ? @entity3 : vice president @entity8 has been incredibly vocal on the issue			1
we had a long talk about the idea of , first and foremost , appointing a high level , full - time envoy that reports directly to the @entity9 so that it 's not just temporary			1
we need somebody working on this , you know , every day -- getting up every morning with their sole job to find peace in the area			0
@entity1 : what did you see last week ? @entity3 : it was rough			1
you know , it 's always rough over there			0
you feel terrible for them			0
they 're hanging on by a thread			1
we saw an awful lot of fear			0
there was [ also ] a tremendous amount of hope			0
you know , there was a lot of hope that these indictments and this new administration are going to be able to help move the international community toward toward a real peace			0
@entity1 : how do you handle just meeting with these people and seeing this tragedy ? personally , how do you handle it ? @entity3 : i could tell you a million stories about how it actually affects you personally			1
but i do n't think people should be going there and coming back and saying how it affected them			0
i think somehow we should all know that these people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth			0
@entity1 : was your safety in jeopardy ? @entity3 : oh , you 're talking about the @entity112 story			1
what , they pulled your security , right ? @entity3 : i was never in jeopardy			2
i was with journalists who wanted to go into some areas that were n't particularly safe			0
and we decided that we would go			0
and that was n't necessarily part of what the @entity112 was looking to do			0
and so we just went on our own			0
i wanted to say something , also , @entity127 , which i forgot to say about what i just did today			0
i delivered 250,000 postcards signed by people all across the country who wanted to help give some political capital to and remind this administration of how important this issue is			0
it was from the @entity5 people			2
but it 's from all across the country			0
and we 're probably going to have another 700,000 by the end of the week			0
@entity1 : what specifically , @entity3 , do you want secretary of state @entity142 and the administration to do ? @entity3 : it does n't appear that the @entity49 is going to send troops in or that the @entity112 is going to send in an army to do this			1
what it really means is that we 're going to need diplomacy			2
and diplomacy has to start and it has to be aggressive and it has to start soon			2
we have an opportunity here			0
@entity1 : one other quick thing			2
are you going to be in the final presentation of " @entity156 ? " @entity3 : actually , i 'm doing a remake of " friends , " which -- i did n't want to break the news			1
@entity1 : oh , my gosh			2
@entity3 : i 'm going be playing the @entity163 role			2
@entity1 : i 'm thrilled for you , @entity3			1
it 's a career move			0
@entity1 : are you going to be in " @entity156 ? " @entity3 : i am			1
i 'm in the last episode with @entity169 and @entity170			0
so it should be fun			0
@entity1 : thanks , @entity3			1
get out of the cold			0
it 's good to talk to you .			0
