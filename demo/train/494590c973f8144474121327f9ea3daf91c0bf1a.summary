@entity0 , @entity1 -- the empty anchorman 's chair in the small television studio said it all			1
@entity7 , @entity1 's most charismatic broadcaster , writer and political commentator had passed away			1
@entity7 was in his 70s			1
he had been battling cancer for years			0
but news of his death after undergoing gallbladder surgery in hospital still came as a shock			0
on thursday night , a hush settled over a bustling restaurant in @entity0 when a waiter turned the tv up to hear the sad announcement			0
only two days before , @entity7 had been broadcasting from behind that same desk			1
he smiled as he spoke			0
he always performed in front of the camera with such energy			0
it looked like he was popping out of his chair			0
it 's tempting and lazy for me to describe @entity7 to foreigners as @entity1 's own " @entity32			1
" but @entity7 was so charming , elegant and vibrant , it 's not fair to compare the veteran journalist to anyone else			1
with @entity7 's passing , @entity1 lost one of its most effective communicators -- not only to millions of @entity1 who watched his news broadcast on @entity41 every night , but also to foreigners like myself who struggle haplessly to explain this fascinating and sometimes frustrating country to the outside world			1
@entity7 had a remarkable way with words , even when he was n't conversing in his native @entity1 or in @entity48 , which he insisted he spoke far better than @entity49			1
" @entity51 , the state has a very heavy hand ! " he exclaimed once , during a radio interview with me in 2007			0
" once you are pursued , once you are sent to trial , everything changes			0
" we were discussing state persecution of journalists			0
it was something @entity7 knew intimately			1
in the 1990s , his reporting angered the army generals who once controlled so much of @entity1 , and he says they sought to punish him for his disobedience			1
years later , the subject kept coming up in our conversations every time a reporter was thrown in jail , every time a journalist was murdered -- even as the government denied involvement			2
" we do n't have enough freedom in criticizing the government , criticizing the police , the security forces			1
that has to be changed , there is no way out , " @entity7 told me in 2010			1
after the @entity81 newspaper editor @entity80 was gunned down on an @entity83 street in 2007 , @entity7 told me he was now living with protection from a body guard			1
" i 'm self - censoring , i do n't want to get into trouble , i do n't want to get shot			2
unfortunately there is this possibility			0
i 'm afraid ! " he said			0
but @entity7 continued writing and broadcasting			1
until about a year ago he was managing editor of @entity2 's joint venture in @entity1 , @entity94			1
every week in his newspaper columns , he gently preached tolerance , urging his leaders and fellow citizens to approach disputes through dialogue rather than fury			2
his final column published in the english - language @entity103 urged hot - headed @entity106 militants and heavy - handed @entity1 cops to show restraint at a demonstration thursday in @entity0 for three @entity106 political activists murdered in @entity111			1
" i want to be hopeful , " the veteran journalist wrote			0
as it turned out , the potentially - explosive @entity0 gathering passed peacefully , with no tear gas , gunfire or @entity117 cocktails			0
@entity7 's message of fairness won him supporters , even within the ranks of @entity1 's deeply alienated @entity106 youth			1
as crowds of @entity106 demonstrators dispersed after the memorial gathering on thursday , a young @entity106 man approached my camera crew			2
" is @entity7 ok ? " he asked , with obvious concern			2
" i heard he was in hospital			0
" i have been a little awestruck by @entity7 , ever since i first met him a decade ago when i was a foreign correspondent in my 20s			2
last year i asked him what words of advice he might have for young @entity1 journalists			2
" one should not fear the government , especially the civilian government			0
we did not fear the military government			0
they should not fear the civilian government , " said @entity7			2
continue insisting on your views			0
" people we lost in 2013 : the lives they lived			0

*respected* @entity1 journalist @entity7 dies after operation
during @entity1 's recent *history* he often angered national leaders
" we do n't have enough freedom in criticizing " *powerbrokers* , he said in 2010
his last published work *included* a plea for calm at a @entity106 demonstration
