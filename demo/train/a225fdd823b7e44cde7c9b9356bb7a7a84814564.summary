-- in a sport famous for its all - consuming rivalries , and mirroring a historical conflict that has caused sporting enmity for decades , the figure skating matchup between @entity2 of @entity3 and @entity5 's @entity4 is one of the most storied competitions in the sport 's history			1
@entity14 will likely host the final chapter in this legendary head - to - head , which has dominated figure skating since both skaters were juniors			1
both @entity2 and @entity4 plan to retire following this year 's @entity20			1
it is also the @entity3 skater 's last chance for @entity25 gold			2
@entity2 finished up as runner - up to her nemesis the last time they met in @entity25 competition , taking the silver while @entity4 grabbed the top podium spot			1
@entity2 , for her part , has won two world championships and the 2013 @entity34			2
" in @entity36 , i had the gold medal as my goal , " @entity2 was quoted as saying on the @entity20 website			1
" i 'd worked for it since i was a child , and afterwards i really regretted my mistakes			0
in @entity14 , i 'd like to erase those memories by doing everything perfectly			2
that 's what i 've been working for these last three years			2
" @entity3 and @entity5 's history , which spanned decades of occupation before entering a post-war state of grudging truce , is the backdrop for the pair 's rivalry			1
the two country 's prior conflicts saw @entity3 colonial rule enacted on the @entity55 from the early part of the @entity57 to the conclusion of the @entity59			0
various diplomatic mis - steps since then have kept relations between the two neighbors as chilly as the surface of @entity14 's @entity64			2
@entity2 and @entity4 have been adversaries since their very early days as competitive skaters , and have shared honors throughout their respective careers			1
they have both been skating competitively since 2005			0
they were born only 20 days apart , in 1990 , and given the length and depth of their on - ice history , it is fitting that they should both choose to bow out of the sport at the same time			0
despite -- or perhaps because of -- their long rivalry , they remain very different skaters			1
the @entity3 skater has long been noted for her technical abilities , while her @entity55 counterpart is praised as a more artistic , emotional skater			0
@entity2 was the first woman to land a triple axel in competition and has since bettered the feat. the 23 - year - old has credited the ongoing competition with her @entity55 counterpart as a key motivation for her continued improvements on the ice			2
they describe their dynamic as friendly , and @entity4 has also acknowledged the importance of @entity2 's part in her professional development			1
" we have been constantly compared since we were in junior competition so i always considered her a rival , " @entity4 told reporters last year			1
" while we want to avoid each other , having her there also gave me motivation and stimulation			0
" as the two prepare to meet one final time , their fans around the world will be glued to their tvs			0
the @entity116 and @entity117 take place on the 19th and 20th of february			0
@entity4 has yet to skate at this @entity20 , although @entity2 arrived in @entity14 last week and has already taken to the ice for her part in the @entity122 event , a new introduction to the @entity124			1
she fell during her @entity116 routine on sunday , and finished third with a score of 64.07			0
despite the @entity3 media saying that she has no problem with her triple axel during practice , it was the difficult jump that undid her at the weekend			0
it is one of her most devastating weapons but she has had trouble re-mastering it following a change of coach			0
teammate @entity138 replaced her for the free skate portion of the event			0
@entity4 is only the third woman to defend her olympic figure skating title , joining @entity142 , who took to the ice in @entity144 26 years ago , and @entity145 , who competed in the 1920 's and 30 's			2
however , a fairytale ending for for one of the skaters could be thwarted by the aptly - named @entity149 , the 18 - year - old @entity150 who will be skating in her first games			1
@entity152 wowed fans with her victory in the @entity155 last month .			0
