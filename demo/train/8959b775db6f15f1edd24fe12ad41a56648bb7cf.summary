-- @entity4 is responsible for the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter @entity4 , a report released thursday by @entity3 's @entity2 concludes			1
a month after a jury acquitted @entity9 on murder and child neglect charges , the state agency found that @entity9 " is the caregiver responsible for the verified maltreatments of death , threatened harm and failure to protect " in her daughter 's death			1
@entity20 , a spokeswoman for the @entity2 , said the report was issued this week as a " professional courtesy " after the sheriff 's office and prosecutors finished their work on the case			1
she added that the state agency is mandated to conduct reviews when there are allegations that a child dies as a result of abuse , abandonment or neglect			0
the agency had no contact with the @entity37 prior to the girl 's disappearance in the summer of 2008 , @entity20 added			1
the @entity41 will not take any further action as a result of the report , capt. @entity40 said thursday			2
" this closes out the @entity2 case , and it does not create additional follow - up on our part , " he said			0
the report said : " @entity50 concludes that the actions or the lack of actions by the alleged perpetrator ultimately resulted or contributed in the death of the child			2
" the report was signed by officials in the department wednesday			0
while she was cleared on murder and aggravated child abuse charges , the 25 - year - old @entity60 woman was convicted on four counts related to misleading law enforcement authorities			2
she was sentenced to four years in jail on those convictions , but was given credit for the time she had already served between her arrest and the end of the seven - week trial and was released from jail in @entity73			0
prosecutors can not appeal the acquittals			0
the report does not address , or substitute for , judgments regarding the guilt or innocence of the caregiver -- in this case , @entity4 -- @entity2 spokeswoman @entity20 said			1
the state report found that @entity9 's " failure to act " in the 31 days between the time the girl was last seen and when police were alerted about the case " delayed and interfered with a law enforcement investigation and best efforts to safely recover the child			1
" the agency report noted there were " no indicators " that @entity4 's death was caused by physical injury , and it was " not substantiated " that she died of asphyxiation -- both points of great contention during the trial			1
an autopsy performed in december 2008 by the local medical examiner determined " that the exact cause of death can not be determined with certainty			0
" prosecutors tried , unsuccessfully , to convince jurors that @entity9 used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct - taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her			0
in its recommendations section , the report said that " the maternal grandfather " -- in this case , @entity9 -- " should have been interviewed for the missing person report			0
" @entity4 's defense lawyer had claimed , in the opening argument of the murder trial , that @entity9 knew @entity4 had died accidentally and helped cover up her death			1
@entity4 had been investigated by the agency , when state child welfare investigators determined on september 14 , 2008 , that there were " verified findings " indicating that @entity9 was responsible for " inadequate supervision and threatened harm " of her child , although it found " no indicators of physical injury			2
" exactly a month later , a grand jury indicted @entity9 on murder and other charges , and the case was eventually reopened by the @entity2			2
no further detail was immediately offered as to why or exactly when the department chose to review the case , or why it came out this week			0
the report released thursday officially closes the department 's investigation in the case			1
in @entity143 's @entity142 and @entity0 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
