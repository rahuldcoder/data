@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 does n't have a flag or a national anthem , but it does have a government			1
for the most part that would be the @entity8 , which faces near - constant scrutiny from countries , corporations and netizens			1
think of @entity8 as the head referee of a heated sporting event , under fire from all sides and rarely able to please everyone			1
last week , the @entity18 wrote a letter saying @entity8 has long failed to provide safeguards that protect consumers from online swindlers and help cybersecurity officials catch such crooks			1
in the letter , the @entity18 also criticized a major @entity8 initiative that would let internet users run their own domain - name extensions , to accompany			1
the federal agency fears that a quick expansion of domains , a project that has been several years in the making , would increase the likelihood that scammers could trick people who enter common misspellings , such as @entity40			2
the government is also concerned that it will have a more difficult time getting information about website owners after the switch			0
" the potential for consumer harm is great , and @entity8 has the responsibility both to assess and mitigate these risks , " four top @entity18 officials wrote in a joint memo			2
the @entity18 's criticisms are just another in a series of legal battles , political pressures and public name - calling that comes with being the most visible party overseeing the global @entity3			1
there are several other governmental gatekeepers for the @entity61 , but @entity8 gets the most attention , and ire			2
as for the domain expansion , @entity8 officials say they are working to improve the data they can provide to governments and police , and that they have stringent rules in place for who can register which extensions			1
another ongoing controversy , the			0
xxx extension for porn sites , was initially resisted by @entity8 's board of directors			1
but the organization now supports it and may have to defend that stance in court against adult - entertainment companies who fear the			2
xxx domains will marginalize their sites			1
how @entity8 works at the helm of this 23 - year - old organization is @entity8 president and ceo @entity86 , a confident and excitable executive with a helmet of long blond hair			1
@entity86 and his 130 or so employees receive a lot of guff , but they are n't afraid to give some back			0
he says he has serious concerns about a bill in the @entity96 called the @entity97 , which shifts much of the blame for carrying illegal content onto website publishers			0
@entity8 , based near @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity1 , was once closely tied to the @entity104 government			2
although it must keep its headquarters in the @entity104 by contract , it has bases in @entity108 and @entity109			0
the @entity104 has sometimes reluctantly loosened its grip over internet governance			0
proposals for new internet initiatives are often handed to @entity8 by various @entity3 registry organizations , and the @entity8 board votes on each			1
the organization has to consider recommendations from a committee of national governments , and many countries have strong opinions			0
with the @entity97 in the @entity104 or systems in @entity123 and other @entity125 countries proposing major changes to who is responsible for what information is posted online , @entity8 has to pick its battles and juggle hundreds of competing interests			2
its critics often overpower its allies			0
as internet access begins to reach practically every part of the world through the proliferation of smartphones , the network is at risk of being pulled in many different directions -- or splintering , as it has behind @entity123 's @entity142			2
no government wants to be the next victim of a so - called social - media coup , in which the freewheeling nature of the @entity61 becomes a target for censorship			0
" @entity8 stays neutral , and it has to keep running , " @entity86 said in a recent interview from his office here in @entity152			2
" we 're a lot like @entity156			0
" a frequent target in international politics , @entity156 is typically neutral but rarely controversial			2
on the other hand , @entity8 receives plenty of blowback for its policies , including for those with which it has little or no direct involvement			2
for example , @entity8 has been criticized for being slow to respond to a shortage of web addresses that could make certain websites inaccessible to some people			1
however , @entity8 has a fairly small role in this transition from internet protocol version 4 to 6 , @entity8 chairman @entity170 said in a phone interview			1
" @entity8 's role in all of this is very restricted , but we often get looked at as the center of these things , " @entity170 said			1
@entity8 officials say its own initiatives , such as			1
@entity182 and the global domain expansion , are controversial but necessary as the @entity3 keeps growing			1
" any time you take a system that started out small and expand it hugely , you get a lot of changes , " said @entity170 , who was a member of the team that posted the first message to @entity186 , the @entity3 's predecessor			1
like any government , @entity8 is said to make decisions slowly			2
@entity170 defends @entity8 's process as thorough and sufficient			1
after a change has been implemented , it is generally up to each country 's government to enforce the rules or systems set up by @entity8			1
" we do n't have the authority of being a government , " he said			0
" if we did , that would create more problems			0
" the @entity208 's governmental bodies say they are more effective at getting things done than @entity104 's political system , which is often seen as polarized and gridlocked			2
the @entity3 has an effective system of checks and balances , said @entity214 , the president and ceo of the @entity216			1
the registry is one of five international groups that propose new initiatives to @entity8			1
" if people ( in national government ) would take time to listen as much as they postulate their views , then we would have progress , " @entity214 said by phone last week			0
" we have people actually discuss the issues			0
we do n't have people showing up with fixed positions			0
" the @entity208 in the efficiency - obsessed technology sector , @entity8 has streamlined its system of yearly goals under @entity86 , a former finance executive for @entity235 who transitioned to high tech and cashed out at the height of the dot - com bubble in 1999			1
@entity86 , who has also served as a director for the @entity104 @entity240 , plans to step down in july			0
@entity8 said last week it is searching for a replacement			2
@entity242 , a sage - like founding father of the @entity3 , has discovered ways to continue contributing to internet governance since stepping down as @entity8 chairman in 2007			1
he is a vice president for @entity246 with the unusual title of chief internet evangelist			0
" the internet does n't just happen , " @entity242 said by phone			0
" it 's a continued battle to keep it as open and accessible and free as possible			0
and it 's hard to do			0
" some of @entity242 's attention has shifted to something called the @entity208			0
as its name implies , the plan involves designing a network that can work in outer space			0
light speed is fine for the @entity260 's @entity3 , but it is an obstacle when sending an e-mail to @entity262			1
but the internet still faces major hurdles on its home planet			0
@entity242 said he believes governmental organizations , like @entity8 , will need to continue to adapt			1
" these institutions got created in response to the forces in the ecosystem , " @entity242 said			0
" i would not say that this was top - down architected			0
i do n't think it could be , because these institutions got created as the demands made themselves apparent			0
" as new demands and stakeholders emerge , the @entity3 and its stewards will find obstacles , whether it 's an overzealous government or the speed of light .			1
