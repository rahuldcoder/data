-- it 's happened again			2
a multimillion dollar jackpot is won and i ca n't help but feel a touch of sympathy and admiration for the winners			1
especially the three from @entity8			1
it 's hard to be unaffected by the circus of speculation surrounding them			1
the rampant jealousy by those commenting is palpable			1
always the questions like a feeding frenzy			1
everyone wants to know how a winner will spend the money			2
everyone speculates how they would spend it if they won			1
it 's the ongoing topic of conversation around the water cooler : the heated argument about taking the lump sum or regular payments			2
and it 's all so very familiar			2
nineteen years ago my father won the lottery			1
three ticket holders split $ 18 million in the @entity35			0
his share was $ 6 million			0
of course now people shrug			0
eighteen million is nothing now , right ? and $ 6 million is chump change			0
but then it was a very big deal			0
the winners ' pictures were in the newspaper			1
a reporter asked each one what they were going to do with the money			1
i wish my father had said , " none of your business			1
" i wish my father had said , " no comment			1
" i wish he 'd had the option of staying anonymous			1
he mentioned in passing that he was probably going to share it with family			0
his saying that caused expectations to rise and relatives oozed out of the woodwork			0
acquaintances cornered us and shared their financial woes			0
representatives of charities and churches descended like a plague of locusts			0
our family became the target of scams			0
from that moment on my identity became permanently entwined with my father 's			2
not just as his daughter , but as the daughter of a lottery winner			2
it 's a testament to my father 's @entity83 heritage that he persevered			2
having money did n't change him , but i noticed it certainly changed those around him			0
it altered people 's perceptions of him			0
after winning the lottery my father was treated like a sage			1
as if his luck was a talent			0
like choosing the correct numbers was a well thought out decision on his part			0
as a writer i absorbed all this			0
it even was the subject of a novel i wrote called , appropriately enough , " @entity35			0
" the passage of time allows for reflection			0
after reading about lottery winners who are slain or who commit suicide or go bankrupt , it seems the @entity8 trio have it all figured out			1
stay anonymous , try not to respond to any questions , and whatever you do , do n't quit your day job			1
for those who still have questions around the water cooler ? my father spent some of the money sending family members to college			1
and he took the payments rather than the lump sum			0
for the past 19 years he has received more than a quarter of a million dollars a year			1
this year will be his last check			0
after all this time the furor has died down			0
i reflect on this and the fact that i wish all the best to the winners and hope they do succeed in remaining anonymous			1
and i hope their lottery win really does allow them to realize their dreams			2
by the way , if you 're wondering whether i buy lottery tickets , the answer is no. no i do n't			2
i think one lottery winner in a family is enough			2
do n't you ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			1

@entity142 : lottery winners face rampant jealousy and *endless* speculation
@entity148 : i know how it feels because my father won the lottery 19 years ago
@entity148 : i wish my father had said " no comment " to everyone who asked questions
she hopes the three lottery winners in @entity8 will be able to stay anonymous
