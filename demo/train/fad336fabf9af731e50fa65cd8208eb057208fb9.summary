@entity1 officials on friday cited security concerns as part of the reason for the school 's reversal of its decision to allow a @entity10 call to prayer to sound from a campus chapel bell tower			1
neither the @entity14 , @entity15 , school nor the local @entity17 office , which was made aware of the situation at @entity1 , would specify details of these concerns , but @entity21 , the university 's vice president of public affairs , said the number and tone of the calls were " pretty loud and nasty			1
" " we have heard from a lot of people who have a lot of interesting and important opinions and perspectives on this , " @entity21 said			0
in a statement thursday , the school said plans changed because its effort to " unify was not having the intended effect			2
" the @entity39 had planned to chant the call , or adhan , from the @entity43 bell tower			2
the adhan signals the beginning of the weekly prayer service			0
@entity48 prayers have taken place in the basement of @entity43 for many years			0
" @entity1 remains committed to fostering an inclusive , tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students , " @entity21 said			2
" i think when you do these kind of things you like to think and you hope that it will be seen by others as you see them as enlightened ways to introduce diversity and the celebration of faith tradition , but unfortunately it does n't happen the way you would like it			0
" plans for the audible call to prayer have been in the works since fall semester and are not in response to recent criticism of @entity10 after the latest terror attacks and arrests , a source with close knowledge of the situation told @entity2			1
the source also said the request did not come from the @entity10 community on campus , but rather the university administration			1
the university 's @entity82 said his community was disappointed in the school 's reversal			1
but he had praise for @entity1 , calling its offerings to the @entity84 " far more comprehensive than many other universities in the entire @entity90 " @entity21 said there will continue to be a call to prayer and service as usual			1
" the only thing that has changed , " he said , " is that it will not come from the bell tower of the @entity43 as previously announced			0
" there were no shortage of opinions on both sides after the reversal			0
@entity103 , son of legendary evangelist @entity104 , applauded the school			0
@entity104 had called on donors to withhold support over the plan to allow the adnan , questioning whether evangelical christians at @entity1 would be allowed to broadcast their " message across campus			1
" others expressed their disappointment in @entity1 for the reversal			2
@entity116 , head of @entity118 studies at @entity1 , directed a criticism at @entity104			1
" spare me , " @entity116 's @entity121 post says , " spare me the paranoia of a wealthy white male @entity123 who talks about being marginalized in @entity90			0
" the @entity124 , the nation 's largest @entity10 civil rights group , called the decision unfortunate , saying the university bowed to intimidation			1
members of the @entity84 will now gather on the quadrangle outside the chapel , a site of frequent interfaith programs and activities , before moving to their regular location for prayers			0
more than 700 of @entity1 's 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students identify as @entity10			1
" our @entity10 community enriches the university in countless ways , " @entity21 said			0
