-- back in 2005 , the future did n't look too bright for @entity2			2
just over 20 years old , the young @entity3 fell onto hard times after losing her job			1
penniless and out of work , she 'd found herself having to raise two baby daughters with no income coming in			0
to survive , @entity2 resorted to a skill she 'd learned from her mother while growing up : weaving bamboo baskets			1
working from her home in the @entity3 capital of @entity17 , she began producing elaborate hampers for friends who were about to get married			1
orders soon started piling in and , as business picked up , her creations quickly became the talk of the town -- including in high circles			0
" my baskets caught the eye of the late president @entity28 's daughter , @entity29 , who was getting married , " recalls @entity2			0
" she ordered 1,000 wedding favor baskets that she needed in three weeks -- there was no way i could have done it myself , so i got some youth and women who i knew could weave and together [ we ] fulfilled the order			1
" that was in 2009 and by 2011 @entity2 had set up @entity39 , a thriving social enterprise focused on producing a wide range of eco-friendly bamboo furniture and baskets -- from beautiful rocking chairs and mirror frames to hand - made dressing tables and storage units			1
" @entity39 is an acronym for my family , " says @entity2			1
" [ @entity51 ] @entity50 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , who 's my husband , and @entity56 , which is our surname , " she adds			1
" @entity39 is all about family , community and friends , that 's who we are			1
" tackling youth unemployment @entity3 is a beautiful landlocked country in southeastern @entity64			1
it is known as the " warm heart " of the continent for its spectacular scenery and friendly people			0
yet , it is also one of @entity64 's poorest nations with chronically high unemployment rates , especially amongst young people			0
" for the past 20 years , those who used to live in the rural areas left for the ' greener pastures ' of the life in the city , " says @entity2			0
" but they end up becoming domestic workers or guards and their children look after each other and sometimes ca n't stay in school and the vicious life cycle continues			0
" read this : luxury shoes put sparkle in your step influenced by her mother , who 'd spent years going to rural areas to teach groups of disadvantaged women how to weave bamboo baskets and furniture , @entity2 also started training young people in her community to help them better their lives			1
" i know how it feels to be unemployed , with a family relying on you to provide for basic necessities , " says the 30 - year - old entrepreneur			0
" instead of them doing nothing at home , let them learn a skill that can basically end up being their income generator , " she says			2
" it is important because unemployment in my country is so high ; we need to break the cycle of poverty that causes gender - based violence , child marriages and prostitution			0
" remarkable turnaround to achieve this , @entity2 works with uneducated women and young people who ca n't get into university			1
" we 've got people who come in who want to train how to make earrings , " she says			0
" we 've got people who come in who want to know how to carve wooden products			2
" and when she 's not training young people , nor running @entity39 , nor mentoring budding entrepreneurs -- not to mention raising her family -- @entity2 manages to find time to attend the @entity137			1
" i have a good job and what is considered a thriving business but this is something i want to achieve for myself , " says @entity2 , who is currently finishing her business degree and plans to start a master 's straight after			2
" i also want to show my daughters , nieces and girls in my community the importance of education -- it opens up your mind and gets you thinking in a different way			0
" it 's been a remarkable turnaround for @entity2 , whose business acumen and social focus has recently won her two international grants , as well as four @entity3 and foreign awards			2
with a growing business and big plans for the years ahead , the future now looks much brighter for this determined entrepreneur with a social conscience			0
" i actually want to set up a skills - development center because i think entrepreneurship is the way for @entity64 to go , " she says			2
" these skills just need to be passed ... because the jobs need to be created -- and how do you create a job if you do n't actually have the papers , and you do n't have a skill ? so that 's where we 're headed			2
