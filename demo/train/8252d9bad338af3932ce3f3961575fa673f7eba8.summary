-- imagine a future passenger experience			1
one that considers both consumer needs and trends in society			1
one that draws from the next generation of technologies that are changing the flying game			1
one in which the flying experience reflects air transport 's environmental responsibility and thus looks for inspiration from nature			1
this is what @entity18 designers are busy imagining with the @entity20 : a holistic , future - oriented approach inspired by nature			1
i discussed this in a @entity26 talk i delivered at @entity27 this past june			2
the approach is presented in our award - winning " @entity35 " showcase in @entity31 and the amazing @entity33 gallery in @entity34			1
these demos offer a platform for discussion and the growth of fresh ideas -- ideas about eco-efficiency combined with eco-effectiveness , and aimed at making sustainability not just another buzzword but something that makes future cabin innovations worth doing			1
when looking at future trends in society , we see a couple of core developments shaping the kinds of passengers that will fly and what they will expect			1
for instance , women are projected to account for more than 70 % of higher - educated students in the @entity58 and for an average of 59 % across the nations of the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) by 2025			1
more women business travelers will mean more of a desire for privacy in a very dense area like an aircraft cabin			2
the graying members of society will have their own requirements : better accessibility to services on board during flights and less stress during boarding and deboarding			2
the list goes on : tall passengers would like more seat pitch , and obese passengers simply need more seat width to enjoy their flight			2
of course , we already have female travelers , old and obese people on board			2
but in the future passenger landscape , how well their travel needs can be accommodated will have a decisive impact on how they choose to spend their vacation and which vehicle they use to get there			1
their growing awareness of the human impact on the environment will cause them to take responsibility for how they travel			2
and there could be a time when some are asked to pay a fee for greenhouse gas emissions			2
passengers may ultimately select airlines based on their environmental profile , not only by the ticket price			2
as we envisioned our future air transportation we needed to consider how technology could help us to combine both passenger comfort and operational efficiency			1
we consulted technology experts , futurists and also experts from other industries for their insights , while staying close to our philosophy : " inspired by nature			0
" for starters , weight reduction is of course key in the aviation industry , and plays a role in improving the environmental profile of the aircraft			0
it 's not enough to build the plane with biodegradable eco-materials if they do n't reduce its weight			0
but airframe structures are already very efficient in terms of weight and structural performance			0
how to improve this further , then ? one way would be to remove all windows and replace them with " digital windows " or simply displays			0
but we wanted to look for other weight - reducing solutions that enhanced the passenger experience			1
thus we came along with structures that are inspired by such things as bird bones , trees and plants			1
a concrete example : slime mold -- a single - celled organism that lives in soil and can spread rapidly -- creates very efficient redundant structures			1
this behavior can be transformed in mathematical equations which are implemented into software			0
using it , we " create " structures that are very light and stable at the same time			0
another example of inspiration for strong , light structure is the water lily " @entity169 " which creates very large leaves that float like pie plates on the water , stable enough for kids to sit on			1
nature is full of similar examples and therefore it is in our interest to preserve its natural diversity			0
we understand nature as an open space from which to get fresh ideas			1
we came up with a portfolio of technologies that would help us turn the ideas into something usable and eco-friendly			1
it included direct manufacturing , fiber optics for data transmission and the idea of transparent @entity188 ( @entity189 ) as a strong and unorthodox material for the aircraft 's outer shell			0
we were trying to determine how different technologies might evolve in context to others -- important , because only if you understand certain technologies and their huge potential are you able to pick the appropriate ones			0
then we used this portfolio of technologies in the context of passenger needs to rethink the traditional class system in the aircraft			0
our concept plane has three different zones			0
first we put our focus on the entrance area with wide central doors , " active surfaces " and shape - changing materials			1
this helped us to create a space which is entirely customizable and transformable during the flight			0
as a passenger you wo n't need to stay in the galley during the flight anymore , when you wish to stand for a while			0
you will meet other passenger in this " interaction zone " to share your thoughts , play digital sports or just have a drink together			0
for the airliner , or customers , new business opportunities come along with this			0
the interaction zone divides the cabin into two other sections : the " smart tech zone " and the " vitalizing zone			0
" the smart tech zone , which is located in the aft fuselage , is focused on business travelers and people who like to use the latest technologies			0
it could also feature seating options -- seats that change shape , have increased pitch and even rows that fold up when they 're empty			0
the vitalizing zone is the big highlight of the concept cabin			0
it responds to passengers ' behavior by tracking their well - being through sensors that can recognize gestures and could perhaps even determine when a passenger is , for example , dehydrated			1
it could also afford an impressive 360 - degree outside view through translucent ceiling and walls			1
as a consequence we had to relocate the cockpit to the cargo bay			0
yes , in the future we consider that pilots are still important			1
you might think that these guys just produced some inspiring pictures of cool , nature - inspired aircraft and futuristic , high - tech interiors			1
or maybe you find our concept cabin disturbing and you never would believe that this might even become reality from the technical perspective			0
or maybe you only would be afraid to imagine sitting as a passenger under a transparent roof while flying at an altitude of 30,000 feet			2
but the core objective is not to consider whether this imagined future is the only way to go , but to paint a picture of the future -- based on scientific trends and technology research -- so that we can understand the core driving forces for air travel and point towards potential solutions			2
you need a picture to make that potential future tangible			2
you need a story about the future -- with images to go along with it -- to help extend the imagination			1
it 's how you turn critical reflection on how to use the technology into a vision of aviation that pushes the boundaries even further			0
see - through cabins and passenger pods : is this the future of flight ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity310			1

@entity310 : future flying experience will be consumer - centered , eco-friendly
he says @entity18 envisions a holistic approach , with a rethinking of airplane interiors
ideas for materials can come from structure of water lilies , slime molds , bird bones
@entity310 : you need an illustrated story of the future to help extend the imagination
