-- @entity1 would be turning 70 years old on october 9			1
at first , @entity2 herself did n't realize the significance of that date			1
" i do n't think about age so much , " she tells " @entity0 "			0
" but i was getting messages from all corners of the world : ' we 're celebrating @entity1 's birthday as a tribute to him			1
' i said , ' what is going on here ? ' it seems like with 70 , there 's an explosion [ of sentiment ]			2
" over the next two months , @entity1 's birthday will be commemorated with tribute concerts , reissues , a new documentary , the annual lighting of @entity2 's @entity24 , even an @entity25 summit			1
why is all this happening now ? " the reason has to do with the social climate , with wanting some of @entity1 's energy , power and conviction , " says @entity2			1
here are some of the highlights			0
documentary on the @entity34 years " @entity38 , " which premiered at the @entity39 september 25 and will debut on @entity40 november 22 , focuses exclusively on the last decade of @entity1 's life , from the time he and @entity2 moved to @entity34 in 1971 until his death in 1980			1
" @entity34 offered him a chance to disconnect from the shackles of the @entity45 , " says director @entity41			1
" it allowed him to be @entity1 and not @entity47			2
it offered simple freedoms , like going to @entity50 and buying a whopper , which he liked to do			0
" the film explores @entity1 's immersion in the city 's downtown arts scene and his raucous rock & roll work with @entity60 , as well as the depression that followed the critical drubbing of his " @entity63 " album and 1972 @entity66 concert ( which is seen here in newly restored footage )			2
it also covers his " lost weekend " in @entity70 , reconciliation with @entity2 and the creation of " @entity73 "			1
@entity74 says @entity2 had to stop and start several times while talking about @entity1 's death , but she gave her blessing to the film nonetheless			1
" it 's ' @entity80 , ' as @entity1 put it , so it 's fine , " @entity2 says			1
" let it all hang out there			0
" photos : @entity86 : a @entity34 love story @entity2 , @entity25 , and others to play @entity70 on october 1 and 2 , @entity2 will revive the @entity89 , the avant - garde outfit she and @entity1 started in 1969 , at the @entity90 in @entity70 joining her for renditions of classic @entity89 material will be @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 of @entity97 , and @entity25 -- who signed up after recently meeting @entity98 in @entity99			1
" @entity25 and i speak the same language , " @entity2 says			1
i saw her show , and it was incredible			0
@entity1 would 've loved it			2
he 's like me -- he went for wild things			0
" " @entity107 " as with last year 's @entity47 reissues , @entity1 's solo catalog -- " @entity89 , " " imagine , " " sometime in @entity34 , " " @entity110 , " and " @entity111 , " along with two albums with @entity2 , " @entity73 " and " @entity113 " -- has been remastered , and will be re-released on october 5			1
@entity2 was heavily involved , according to @entity114 , a former @entity115 engineer who worked on the project : " she knows everything about the songs , and she knows exactly how @entity1 's vocals should sound			1
" for @entity2 , though , the experience was unexpectedly difficult			2
" i thought it was going to be fine -- listening to @entity1 's songs has been a routine thing for me for the last 30 years , " she says			1
" but this time , maybe because i listened to all of them , it was very hard , emotionally hard			0
' i 'm losing you ' -- that really hit me			0
" " @entity73 " will also be packaged with a special " @entity133 " edition , featuring bare - boned versions of the original tracks			0
" @entity1 's voice is right up there , and it 's so beautiful , " @entity2 says			1
" his diction was very unique			0
it 's like listening to a @entity139 actor			0
i wanted to tell him but he was n't here , and that really upset me			0
" for fans , a box set , " @entity80 " , will be particularly enticing ; a bonus disc includes previously unreleased home recordings of songs from 1970 's volcanic " @entity89 " ( " @entity149 , " " @entity150 , " " mother , " " @entity152 " ) along with other tracks from his subsequent records			0
top ten @entity45 songs of all time " @entity159 film " this independently - made @entity161 movie takes an unexpected focus : it 's a biopic concerned solely with @entity1 's teenage years in @entity164			1
the film , which is based on a memoir by @entity1 's half sister @entity167 , hinges on the relationship between the future @entity47 ; his guardian , @entity170 ; and his free - spirited mother , @entity167 , who abandoned @entity1 at four and then reappeared when he was 15			2
" it 's a love triangle that happens to be about @entity1 , " says director @entity172			2
" there were two strong women then -- and that [ dynamic ] played out throughout his life			0
" @entity2 's @entity177 on october 9 , @entity2 will preside over the annual lighting of the @entity179 -- 15 searchlights pointed skyward -- on an island off @entity182 , @entity183			1
she 'll also present @entity185 awards to four recipients -- authors @entity187 and @entity189 , public health advocate @entity190 , and documentary filmmaker @entity192 -- whose work is " based on their courage and commitment to peace , truth , and human rights			2
" to cap it off , she 'll give a special @entity89 performance with a lineup that will include her son @entity98 along with @entity203 , @entity204 , and other members of the current @entity89			0
the show will be dedicated to @entity1 , who once asked @entity2 to turn her conceptual idea for a light tower ( from her book " @entity210 " ) into an actual sculpture			1
" @entity1 invited me over and said , ' i want this in my backyard , ' " she recalls			2
" and i said , ' this is just an idea			0
' but for him , it was real			0
he was the first person who picked up on that concept			0
" rockers cover @entity1 in concert @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , and @entity223 will be among the musicians participating in a @entity1 tribute concert on november 12 at @entity34 's @entity226			1
the proceeds will benefit the @entity228 , which brings music education programs to impoverished communities around the world			0
the show will feature covers of songs from throughout @entity1 's entire career -- " it 'll be all @entity1 , " says organizer @entity237			2
