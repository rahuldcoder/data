on friday , president @entity5 and @entity4 president @entity6 agreed to speed up the military transition in that country , meaning @entity4 forces will take the lead in combat operations nationwide starting this spring			1
that transition was previously seen happening mid-year			0
" what 's going to happen this spring is that @entity4 will be in the lead throughout the country			1
that does n't mean that coalition forces including @entity2 forces are no longer fighting , " @entity5 said			1
" they will still be fighting alongside @entity4 troops			0
it does mean though that @entity4 will have taken the lead and our presence , the nature of our work will be different			2

the mood was cordial , belying the tense relationship of years past			0
besides the accelerated timetable , @entity5 and @entity6 agreed that the @entity2 would hand over full control of @entity4 prisoners			1
that demand had been a major sticking point for @entity6 , who in return signaled he could be willing to consider immunity for @entity2 forces beyond 2014			1

if there is no immunity agreement , the @entity2 might find itself in a similar situation as when it left @entity67			2
