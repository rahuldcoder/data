@entity0 -- they are two of @entity4 's premier art destinations , filled with treasures amassed over centuries			2
now the @entity7 in @entity8 is presenting a " mini-museum " inside the @entity16 in @entity17 , showcasing paintings by @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , as well as ancient gold artifacts from @entity14			1
" @entity29 in the @entity16 " is the second part of an exhibition exchange -- initiated as part of @entity22 - @entity21 2011 , dedicated to promoting and strengthening the economic , political , cultural and scientific ties between the two nations -- that saw the @entity16 exhibiting precious items from its own extensive collection in the @entity7 in february 2011			1
" it was really the finest show that 's ever come out of the @entity16 and it reflected the idea of our museum , as it were , nestling inside theirs , " said @entity30 , deputy director of the @entity16 and curator of the exhibition			2
now some 180 items from the @entity7 's world - class collection are nestling inside the many galleries of the @entity16 , ranging from archaeological pieces all the way to modern masterpieces by @entity47			1
but , @entity30 said , this is n't a typical touring exhibition			0
" you 've got to remember that the @entity7 has not been visited by many @entity22 and it 's still far away and it 's still mysterious and exotic and we wanted the public to experience something of the special character of it , which is of course a palace as well as a museum , " said @entity30			2
special furniture and ornaments typical to the @entity7 , such as granite vases , were brought in to decorate the galleries to make it look more like the @entity64 museum , whose collection was begun by the @entity67			1
in a statement to the press in november , @entity68 , director of the @entity7 , said : " with this exhibition , we wanted to tell the story of our museum and its collection and the history of the @entity77			0
" in addition to the objects collected by the voracious @entity80 are ornate @entity82 objects from the collection of earlier @entity77 , @entity84			0
" never before has there been an exhibition like this , from and about the @entity7 , abroad , " @entity68 continued			0
aside from both having world - class collections , @entity30 points out that they have something else in common -- both have their origins as royal collections			0
" one can think of @entity80 in @entity64 and @entity94 the @entity95 here in @entity22 , who collected with a real passion , because they were personally interested but also because they knew it brought glory to the monarchy and to the country , " said @entity30			0
" they 're also the two extremes of @entity4 , the @entity7 at the very top end and the @entity16 at the bottom end , so they 're the two extremes of @entity4 coming together , showing things that are on one level very similar and on another level , very different , " he finished .			1
