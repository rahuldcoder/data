if you want to know how @entity2 schoolchildren are performing , you do n't have to look far : a wealth of information is available , thanks to the @entity6			1
go online and see , for instance , that @entity9 children outperform those in @entity11 , that average math scores have gone up nationally over the past 20 years and that the @entity13 was the only urban district to improve in math and reading in grades 4 and 8 last year			0
but what if you want to know how much students are learning in college ? here , the trail grows cold			1
the @entity22 administration 's proposed college ratings would measure access , affordability and outcomes such as graduation rates -- all of which are well worth tracking			1
but there 's no proposal to find a way to measure student learning			1
this failure to examine systematically what is , after all , the core mission of colleges is a big problem for @entity2 higher education			1
we 're awash in efforts to improve the quality and cost - effectiveness of our colleges			0
but without a better base of comparative evidence , we wo n't really know how these reforms affect learning			1
that 's why it 's time for @entity6 to go to college			1
tests of what college students know are nothing new , of course , within individual classrooms and institutions			1
comparative , standardized measures are rarer , though -- and much more controversial among college leaders			1
there 's the @entity61 , or @entity62 + , which examines critical thinking , reading and writing skills and is administered to small samples of undergraduates at about 200 colleges each year			2
but many wary administrators contend the @entity62 should be used for self - assessment and career placement rather than college - to - college comparisons			2
and some wo n't make their data public			0
that may be no surprise : a 2011 book drawing on @entity62 data found dismayingly low levels of student learning across the nation			2
it 's the same with the @entity81			2
a growing number of colleges use this survey , which does n't measure learning directly but asks students about things such as how often they write long papers or talk with professors outside class			1
however , many still do n't release the results off - campus , preferring to use them for internal improvement			0
an intriguing new initiative led by @entity9 will compare student learning across nine states by evaluating work such as student papers and lab reports			2
but because it will consciously avoid standardized tests , its ability to make credible cross-state comparisons may be limited			2
the enormous advantages of an integrated , independent national test are clear			0
like the @entity6 used in elementary and secondary schools , a college @entity6 could be administered to representative samples of students around the country			1
it would provide broad national and state - level results , including a breakdown of learning outcomes by race and socioeconomic status , and trends over time			2
it would n't assess individual colleges , which should alleviate the ( overblown ) anxieties of educators worried about curriculum - narrowing or one - size - fits - all rankings			0
still , the idea has long been contentious			0
it last received serious consideration more than 20 years ago , when the @entity128 recommended a voluntary national assessment to gauge the number of college graduates with advanced critical thinking and problem - solving skills			0
but higher education groups torpedoed the proposal			1
they argued , among other things , that a single measure would be unfair to institutions with large proportions of disadvantaged students , including community colleges			0
today , a collegiate @entity6 would undoubtedly face similar objections			0
in fact , even as an idea , it already has -- in rather dramatic terms			0
@entity146 , senior associate at the @entity147 , contended recently that the " shadow of a government test , " taken by very different kinds of students , studying a variety of subjects at a wide range of institutions , " is enough to freeze the soul , let alone elementary statistical sanity			0
" but objections based on the diverse nature of @entity2 higher ed do n't carry a lot of weight when lobbed at a sample - based test of vital academic skills that any student should be learning at any college			1
indeed , testing expert @entity167 of the @entity169 , who once ran @entity6 , has sketched a persuasive vision of a new experimental test that could make cross-state comparisons and also provide achievement data for different groups of institutions , from community colleges and liberal arts schools to @entity179 universities			0
the next time a state boasts about the prowess of its universities , would n't it be nice to have an objective yardstick -- a reality - check that shows how those undergrads stack up academically against their peers in the rest of the country ? it 's an appealing prospect			1
why not give it a try ?			0

@entity195 : you can find lots of information on @entity2 schoolchildren 's performance
but no tests exist to find out how students are doing in higher education , he says
@entity195 : we need evidence to be able to see how reforms affect learning at college
it also would be *helpful* to find out how undergrads stack up academically , he says
