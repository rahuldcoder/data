-- for those on a quest to visit all 50 @entity4 , each one is like a jagged piece of a very large jigsaw puzzle			1
fitting in all 50 states is an impressive achievement			1
in fact , anyone who knocks 35 off the list is eligible for membership in the exclusive @entity13 , an organization that recognizes individuals who make it to every state with a plaque or certificate to commemorate their accomplishment			1
to " visit " a state , a person has to step outside the airport and breathe the air , according to the organization 's website			1
those who are truly passionate about making it to all 50 states often have their own criteria for crossing them off the list , from a hard - core requirement of staying in a state for more than a month to simply hopping out of the car to snap a picture at the border			1
@entity4 odyssey : 50 states in 31 years @entity0 asked avid 50 - staters to run down their requirements			1
here 's how it 's done : go beyond the border back in 1976 , @entity43 of @entity44 , now 53 , and his friend @entity45 made a bet to see who would be the first one to set foot in all 50 states			1
at stake was a six - pack of beer			1
in order to count a state as " visited , " the two men agreed that they had to spend at least one full hour in a state during the day , be outdoors at least part of the time , set foot on the actual ground , and go beyond the state 's border			1
airport property also did n't count			0
the bet lasted 15 years , until @entity43 received a postcard from @entity45 declaring he had reached his 50th state			1
@entity43 was still two states shy of completing his goal , making sure he followed the criteria they set when they first made the bet			1
it took seven more years for @entity43 to visit @entity73 , the one state he needed			1
" being one state shy annoyed me			1
i needed to take matters into my own hands , " he said			0
sent to @entity77 on business in 1998 , he extended his stay to rent a car and drive north to @entity73			0
" i was sure to send @entity45 a card , " @entity43 recalled			0
it simply said , ' 50 ! ' " 50 states , 50 spots to visit in 2014 let the kids choose together the @entity87 family of @entity88 has traveled to 40 states			1
their oldest child , @entity90 , is barely a teenager			0
@entity87 says that she and her husband , @entity92 , have been taking their 13 - year - old daughter @entity90 and 7 - year - old son @entity45 on trips since they were infants			1
once @entity90 and @entity45 were old enough , @entity87 and her husband started letting them take turns deciding where the family would go each year			0
because the family often drives to their destinations , they try to stop in as many states as they can in one trip			1
" we 're not competitive , " @entity87 said , but they are strategic			0
" we do have plans on which states to visit over the next few years so that we do hit 50 before our daughter leaves for college			1
" @entity87 keeps track of the states they 've seen in an @entity117 spreadsheet , using the list to plan what stops they 'll make on future trips			2
" we drive so much on our vacations and camp a lot			0
we 've actually gotten out and seen the states			2
" the family typically stays in each state they visit for three days , but apart from how long they stay , there 's really only one other agreed - upon criterion			1
" my husband has ( visited ) 46 states			2
he 's not allowed to get to 50 unless we 're all together			2
" go back to fill in the blanks @entity134 had a deadline to meet			0
he and his wife , @entity136 , had been taking long road trips during their summers off from teaching since 2009			2
it was n't until their second big road trip in 2012 that they saw how close they were to visiting all 50 states , and they decided to go for it			1
but @entity134 wanted to push this goal even further			0
the deadline : his 30th birthday			0
" i used ( turning ) 30 as a reason to do this , to keep traveling places i might not go otherwise , " he said			0
on an old road atlas he keeps in the glove compartment of a baby blue @entity158 , @entity134 kept track of all the states he and his wife visited			2
at the bare minimum , he considers getting a snapshot at a state 's border beneath the welcome sign enough to circle it on his map			1
but on average he and his wife try to stay in each state at least two days			2
they even took seasonal jobs at @entity171 in @entity172 for seven weeks so they would have the opportunity to really witness its wildlife			0
when they got back home to @entity178 after their @entity172 trip , @entity134 's deadline was fast approaching			0
with only three weeks until he turned 30 , the couple packed up and raced to hit the two states they had yet to see : @entity183 and @entity184			2
despite their short stay in each state , @entity134 was not disappointed			2
" no matter how much time i stay in a state , i 'm never going to see the whole thing , " he said			1
these road trips are " highlight trips			0
" now that he and his wife have seen all 50 states , they 're able to stay in one place a little longer			1
" on the road trips we saw what all the states were known for , and now we can go back and explore them in depth			2
" connect with people long - time friends @entity204 and @entity205 , both 29 , have put their lives on hold to embark on a seven - month journey across the country , volunteering in each state they visit			1
" we were both at points where we needed direction in our lives			0
we were both in ruts and needed a change to do something else , " said @entity204 , who quit her job before leaving on this trip			0
since the two women started on their journey from their homes in @entity224 on april 28 , they have already picked up nine states			2
they have been staying in each state for anywhere from three to five days , devoting one full day to volunteering and staying at campsites or with other volunteers they work with			2
in @entity232 , the women worked in a community garden with @entity234 , a group of @entity236 students and @entity238 residents who grow food for local pantries			0
in the @entity241 in @entity242 , they found a local farmer and helped him grow tomatoes			0
next , they 're volunteering in @entity246 with @entity247 , baking snacks for the families of cancer patients			0
they 're journaling and blogging about their experiences in each state , and they use a calendar to keep themselves organized and on track			0
but they 're really in no rush to finish their journey across the country			0
they want to live in the moment and see where it takes them , @entity204 says			0
" we want to connect with the different people we meet on this trip , " @entity204 said			1
" there are so many people who have opened their homes and their hearts to us , and that 's how we get a true idea of what a place is really like			0
