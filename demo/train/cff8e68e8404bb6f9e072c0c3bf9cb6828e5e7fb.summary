-- it 's unlikely commercial aviation stories in 2014 will surpass those of 2013 for pizzazz or significance			1
this is probably a good thing			0
who could have foreseen the three - month grounding of the entire @entity9 fleet when we forecast events for 2013 ? we were only 16 days into 2013 when 50 787s worldwide were grounded following a battery fire on a @entity14 787 and a near - fire occurred days later on an @entity17 flight			0
@entity18 ended the year with embarrassing , dysfunctional standoff with its largest union , the @entity20 , over where the @entity21 ( successor to the popular 777 airliner now in service ) will be built			1
in between these bookends were first flights of the @entity18 787 - 9 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
the latter was an attempt by the @entity33 firm to challenge @entity28 and @entity18 at the lower end of the mainline jet sector			1
and @entity36 and @entity37 merged in december after negotiating a settlement to a surprise lawsuit by the @entity41 @entity40 ( which sought to block the merger ) creating what is widely regarded as the world 's largest airline			2
by comparison , 2014 should be relatively quiet			2
that 's not to say it wo n't be fascinating			2
here 's what we forecast for the major players in the year ahead			2
consumers : more fees , tighter seats , " connected " flight attendants passengers will get more opportunities to connect with the internet while in - flight , but at a cost , as airlines continue to seek more profits from ancillary fees			2
it 's likely that a number of fees will rise in 2014 : ticket change fees , on - board purchases and baggage fees being the biggies			1
more passengers in the @entity41 will be able to apply for @entity73 , as that program expands			0
previously , the program has been largely confined to frequent fliers invited in by the airlines and those who applied for and were approved for @entity80 and @entity81 programs			0
@entity73 allows passengers to keep shoes and jackets on , laptops and 3 - ounce liquids packed and even pockets filled -- just like the pre- 9/11 days			0
the ugliest projection for 2014 ? tighter seating			1
" @entity36 will continue to reconfigure their aircraft with slim seats in super-snug seating configurations , in a bid to squeeze in more passengers and generate additional revenue , " says @entity90 , founder of the @entity92 website that tracks passenger experience			2
" yet , in parallel with this trend , carriers are also moving rapidly to offer the type of technology in - flight that will distract our brains from the pain , including providing power for our personal electronic devices , faster / better connectivity , wireless in - flight entertainment and , increasingly , personalized service from flight attendants who will be armed with ' connected ' tablets			2
" @entity18 : preserve or obliterate its largest union ? the @entity41 - based multinational behemoth is expected to announce in january where it will build its new @entity121			1
the decision may be of limited global interest ( though @entity124 is bidding on building the wings ) , but it 's a matter of burning interest in the @entity41 , particularly in @entity127 , @entity18 's traditional base of manufacturing			1
@entity127 stands to lose upward of 27,000 direct and indirect jobs in the 2020 decade if the @entity21 is built outside the state			0
the location hinges on a january 3 vote of @entity18 's " touch labor " union , the @entity20			1
if members vote to accept a revised version of the contract offer they rejected by a 2 - 1 margin on november 13 , the @entity21 assembly and wing production will be placed in the state 's @entity143 area			0
if not , the jobs could go elsewhere -- or the fuselage may stay in @entity127 with wing production at another site			0
update : in a stunning reversal of the november 13 vote , @entity151 union members on jan. 3 voted narrowly to accept the revised contract			0
the vote was 51 % to 49 %			0
members continued to object to the terms and conditions of @entity18 's revised contact offer			1
they said it was n't much better than the one rejected november 13 on a 67 % -33 % vote			0
but heavy pressure within and from outside the union , particularly from elected and civic officials in the @entity166 area , and the fear of losing jobs in the long - term , appeared to be enough to sway the vote			0
by march , @entity18 should announce where it will assemble the 787 - 10 -- expectations are for its plant in @entity174 , @entity175			1
the 787 - 9 is in flight - testing , which by all reports is going smoothly			0
@entity18 is currently scheduled to deliver the first 787 - 9 to @entity178 in june			1
@entity28 : end of the line for @entity28 ? the @entity182 company 's highly anticipated @entity28 - 900 aircraft began flight - testing just before the 2013 @entity184 and is proceeding smoothly			1
officials claim the program is " on track " for first delivery to launch customer @entity188 in 2014 , but the precise date has been a moving target			0
then the company said september would be the magic time			0
then delivery became november or december			0
more generically , officials say delivery will come in " late 2014			0
" it 's possible delivery could slip to early 2015			0
whether it 's late 2014 or early 2015 matters little , just so long as delivery does n't slip beyond that			1
more interesting for aviation geeks is what appears to be the drip , drip , drip demise of the smallest family member , the @entity28			1
there are now just 61 in backlog , following the widely expected decision by the new @entity36 to swap merger partner @entity37 ' order of 18 @entity215 for the larger -900 model			0
industry experts believe @entity28 will continue to urge customers to swap to the -900 and formally or informally discontinue offering the -800 this year			1
this would be followed by a decision to launch a re-engined version of the popular @entity222 , a model that entered service in 1994 and has sold more than a thousand planes			2
problem is , the @entity222 's older engines are n't competitive with the new technology power - plants on the 787 and the @entity28			1
a re-engined @entity222 , with derivatives of the @entity231 and @entity232 engines used on the 787 , would make the @entity222 much more competitive			0
given its far cheaper price tag than the @entity28 or 787 , this could give the aircraft life well into the 2020s			2
@entity29 : huge expectations , precious little time to reach them traditionally operating in the shadows cast by @entity18 and @entity28 , the @entity33 aircraft company will have to sweat a bit if it wants to steal some of the spotlight it bid for in 2013			1
this makes it one of the more interesting players to watch in the year ahead @entity29 's @entity29 aircraft made its first flight september 16			1
since then , company officials have stuck with an aggressive entry - into - service ( @entity251 ) plan to follow within 12 months slower than expected progress on flight - testing and a test schedule largely discounted as too optimistic , however , have led most aerospace analysts to conclude that the aircraft wo n't likely see service until the first quarter of 2015			0
@entity259 , an early customer , is supposed to receive its first @entity29 in february 2015 , based on the current september 2014 @entity251 plan			1
@entity29 officials told a @entity264 newspaper the company is now planning delivery in the summer of 2015 or even later , at least five months beyond projections			2
@entity29 is expected to give an @entity251 update on its 2013 year - end earnings call february 11			2
a new delay of six - to - nine months is expected to be announced			0
an eis date slip from the original plan of december 2013 to mid- 2015 ( a period of about 18 months ) would put the aircraft on a par with the @entity28 's delays , but well ahead of the 3 Â½ years of delays for @entity18 's 787 .			1

the ugliest projection for 2014 ? tighter seating
burning january issue : @entity18 's decision on where to build its new @entity121
@entity28 may begin *phasing* out @entity28
planned for service in september 2014 , @entity29 's *cseries* will likely be delayed
