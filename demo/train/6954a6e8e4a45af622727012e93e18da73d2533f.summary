-- goals at the end of each half from @entity4 and @entity5 threw an enthralling @entity7 title race wide open as @entity8 secured a 2 - 0 win at leaders @entity10 sunday			1
the defeat ended a run of 11 straight wins for @entity10 , who were frustrated by the tactical wiles of @entity18 's visitors , to leave their bid for a first @entity22 championship in 24 years in the balance			2
@entity8 have closed to within two points but it is @entity26 who have emerged as the most likely challengers after a 2 - 0 win at @entity30 in the late game sunday			1
first half goals from @entity33 and @entity34 gave @entity26 a comfortable victory and the knowledge that if can win their final three games they will repeat their 2012 @entity7 title triumph			1
@entity26 still remained in third place , three points adrift , but have a game in hand over the top two			1
earlier , @entity8 , who held @entity46 goalless in the first leg of their @entity49 semifinal in midweek , made seven changes from that starting line - up , but it scarcely showed in a resilient display			2
they went ahead just before halftime as @entity55 star @entity4 continued his recent run of crucial goals after a slip by @entity10 captain @entity59			1
@entity10 , who have scored a leading 96 goals in the @entity7 this season , were restricted to few chances with @entity64 unable to add to his personal tally of 30			1
his second half effort was saved by @entity68 and the veteran @entity70 goalkeeper also kept out shots from @entity72 and @entity59			2
desperately pushing forward at the end , @entity8 were caught by a sucker punch as substitute @entity75 broke clear and unselfishly played in @entity5 for the clinching second in injury time			1
" a magnificent performance from all my team , " was the verdict of @entity18 , who will be hoping they can repeat the success when they entertain @entity46 in the second leg wednesday			0
his @entity10 counterpart @entity84 was less than impressed by @entity8 's stifling tactics			1
" i think there were two buses parked today , never mind one , " he told @entity86			0
" it was like a back six with three midfield players in front of that			0
that 's 10 , with the goalkeeper , for 90 consistently behind the ball			0
" it was clear that they 'd come certainly not wanting to win the game , with the time - wasting and whatnot , " he added			2
@entity18 has received a further boost , which he revealed during his post-match press conference			0
key defender @entity103 , who looked set for a long absence after injuring his ankle in the @entity46 draw , may be fit to make an earlier return			0
" he has a chance , " @entity18 said			0
" let 's see tomorrow and after tomorrow			0
after the match against @entity46 , i said no chance			0
in this moment , i say maybe			0
" his @entity10 counterpart @entity84 was less than impressed by @entity8 's stifling tactics earlier sunday , @entity113 , whose shock victory last week at @entity8 so dented the title hopes of @entity18 's men , carried on that superb form with a 4 - 0 thrashing of fellow strugglers @entity121			1
@entity122 scored a double , his fifth goal in three games , as @entity113 moved out of the bottom three but left their @entity126 opponents in deep relegation trouble .			2
