the @entity2 program that collects data on nearly every @entity5 phone call is n't legal , a privacy review board said thursday in a newly released report			1
moreover , the five - member @entity7 said it 's been largely useless in thwarting terrorism			0
" we have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the @entity5 in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation , " the board wrote in the report released thursday			2
despite @entity21 's @entity2 changes , phone records still collected the board said it had identified only one instance in which the program helped authorities identify a terrorist in the last seven years			1
but the board said law enforcement would have found the suspect anyway , even without the @entity2 program			0
the board does n't have any legal teeth , so its recommendations wo n't change government practices the way a court ruling might			1
but the findings are a stinging rebuke of president @entity21 's legal defense of the program , in which the @entity2 tracks millions of telephone calls each day , harvesting the telephone numbers involved , the time calls are placed and how long they last			1
the recommendations of the board add to the growing chorus calling for an end to the government 's dragnet collection of @entity5 ' phone records , said sen. @entity52 , @entity53 , the chairman of the @entity54			1
" the report reaffirms the conclusion of many that the @entity60 bulk phone records program has not been critical to our national security , is not worth the intrusion on @entity5 ' privacy , and should be shut down immediately , " @entity52 said in a statement			1
" the report appropriately calls into question the legality and constitutionality of the program , and underscores the need to change the law to rein in the government 's overbroad interpretation of @entity74			1
" a majority of the board -- formed as part of the federal government 's response to the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks -- agreed with critics of the @entity2 that the program raises constitutional concerns			2
" the @entity86 concludes that @entity60 does not provide an adequate legal basis to support the program , " it wrote its report			0
@entity89 reviewed a copy of the report			0
the board said the law authorizes the @entity94 to collect records related to a specific investigation , but not bulk collection of data that " can not be regarded as ' relevant ' to any @entity94 investigation			2
" what @entity21 changed at the @entity2 : 5 takeaways the law also " does not authorize the @entity2 to collect anything , " the board said			2
last week , after a report by an outside review group appointed by @entity21 , the president announced changes to the program			1
among other things , the @entity2 must now ask a judge each time an analyst wants to look at the data , and the agency will eventually lose its role as custodian of the information			0
but @entity21 said he felt it important to keep the program intact			2
" the review group turned up no indication that this database has been intentionally abused , " he said			0
" and i believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved			0
" one privacy advocate called the changes " window dressing			0
" the government is now studying whether to require telephone companies to hold the data , or to create a new third - party agency to collect the data .			0

" report appropriately calls into question " program 's legalitity , sen. @entity52 says
bulk telephone record collection has n't thwarted terrorism , board rules
the board 's findings wo n't immediately change *policy*
but they are a stinging rebuke to president @entity21 's defense of the program
