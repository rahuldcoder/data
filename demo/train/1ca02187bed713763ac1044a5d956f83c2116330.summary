-- @entity3 's @entity2 selections endured largely disappointing finishes to the final build - up tournament before the biennial clash gets underway later this week as @entity8 @entity7 won the @entity9 sunday			1
@entity7 overcame a poor start to his round at @entity12 , venue for the @entity14 , to finish on 14 - under after a level par 71			1
it was his fourth victory on the @entity17 , but his late season form came too late to earn him a spot in @entity21 's team to face the @entity22 at @entity23 next friday			1
@entity7 had to battle to salvage a par - five on the 18th to hold off @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity27 's @entity26 at @entity12			1
@entity28 finished with a six - under burst for the last five holes and @entity26 also birdied the 18th to set the target for @entity7			1
" it was tough , it was hard work down the last , " said @entity7 four members of @entity21 's 12 - strong team were in action in @entity9 with @entity2 debutant @entity37 the best placed			1
he birdied the last for a 67 to finish on 12 - under and a tie for fourth alongside @entity40 @entity39 , @entity25 's @entity41 , @entity43 's @entity42 and @entity44 of @entity45			2
but @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity48 of @entity25 were distinctly out of sorts in their final tune ups			2
veteran @entity46 shot a 74 to finish one over par and a rusty @entity48 struggled to a 76 for two over			0
he will be making his ninth appearance later this week and was unfazed by his poor display			0
" i hit a few good shots ( this week ) , not so good today , but i probably had one eye on next week			0
i do n't think the concentration and the focus was there , " he told the @entity17 website			0
" the @entity2 is very special , i am looking forward to getting there tonight and preparing for friday when it starts			1
" at least @entity48 and @entity46 made the cut			0
@entity64 , making his debut as one of @entity21 's picks , failed to make the weekend			0
meanwhile , world number one @entity68 said he was looking forward to capping his remarkable year with a third @entity2 triumph			2
" personally for me it would just be the icing on the cake of what 's already a fantastic year , " he told @entity70			0
" it 's way better to win as part of a team			0
the best experiences in my golf career have been the @entity2 and to be able to celebrate with all these guys			2
" @entity68 famously nearly missed his tee time ahead of the final day singles match at @entity83 in 2012 , but made it with minutes to spare to beat @entity85 as @entity3 completed a remarkable comeback to retain the trophy .			1
