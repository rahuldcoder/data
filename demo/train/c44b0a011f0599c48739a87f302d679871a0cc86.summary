it had been in @entity15 since 2003 , when an art dealer smuggled it into the country from @entity4			1
customs officials have long wanted to return the rhyton to @entity4 , according to a @entity22 report			2
but decades of frigid relations between @entity24 and @entity25 kept it frozen in bureaucratic limbo			1

it was the first time a @entity3 president has spoken to his @entity4 counterpart since 1979			2

" it will be a long path to restored relations , the president said , but it could lead to the end of crippling economic sanctions against @entity4 , which could help " the @entity4 people fulfill their potential			0
" if @entity6 has his way that potential will include the exchange with the @entity3 of a lot of art , artifacts and archeology -- set to classical music			1
