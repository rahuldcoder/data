-- it 's almost entirely illegal to use drones for money - making purposes in the @entity4			1
but a little @entity6 magic could change that			0
the @entity4 government is considering a request from movie and tv producers to let them use unmanned aircraft to shoot aerial video			1
currently , there 's only one exemption to the @entity17 's nationwide ban on commercial drones , called unmanned aircraft systems or @entity20			1
that 's a spot off @entity23 's coast where drones are used by an oil company			2
but a second exemption could make it easier and less expensive to create memorable movie moments like the opening sequences from @entity31 's " @entity30 " and @entity32 winner " @entity33			2
" " unmanned aircraft systems offer the motion picture and television industry an innovative and safer option for filming , " @entity35 , senior vice president for the @entity36 , said in a written statement			2
" this new tool for storytellers will allow for creative and exciting aerial shots , and is the latest in a myriad of new technologies being used by our industry to further enhance the viewer experience			0
" we welcome the @entity17 's leadership and support their guidance to safely authorize the use of @entity55 for the motion picture and television industry			1
" on monday , the @entity17 officially confirmed it is considering the request , which came from seven photo and video production companies			1
the administration 's statement acknowledged that @entity6 could see " tangible economic benefits " from an exemption			0
" however , all the associated safety issues must be carefully considered to make sure any hazards are appropriately mitigated , " the statement continued			0
companies would still have to apply individually for permission to use drones if the exemption is approved , the @entity17 said			1
how to shoot amazing video from drones @entity75 , a production company that specializes in aerial shots , is one of the companies that have asked for the exemption			1
in their application , published by @entity83 , a @entity0 content partner , @entity80 said shots done with lightweight , remote - controlled drones would be safer and less disruptive than current shoots that use helicopters			0
@entity80 said its drones weigh less than 55 pounds , including camera equipment , and almost always travel at speeds of less than 57 mph			0
" all flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner 's prior consent and knowledge , " the @entity94 - based company wrote			0
" filming will be of people who have also consented to being filmed or otherwise have agreed to be in the area where filming will take place			0
" the suggestion of an exemption marks something of a change for the @entity17			1
as companies from web retail behemoth @entity111 to pizza chain @entity113 's have toyed with the idea of deploying drones , the administration has been slow to craft new rules and regulations for them			1
the @entity23 exemption , for @entity120 oil company , came only after prodding from @entity121			0
hobbyists in the @entity4 are allowed to fly small drones below 400 feet for noncommercial purposes			2
but one of the administration 's key concerns is how to allow commercial drones without endangering airplanes and other existing , manned aircraft			2
after a decade of pondering , the @entity17 said it plans to release a proposal for new regulations in november			0
even if it does , it could be months , if not years , before the proposals become legally binding			0
in its statement , the @entity17 said companies from three other industries have filed similar appeals for exemptions to the federal ban on commercial drones : agriculture , power line and pipeline inspection , and oil and gas - line inspection .			1

seven production companies have *petitioned* the @entity17 to use drones for aerial video
the @entity36 filed on behalf of them
currently , there 's only one exemption to @entity4 commercial - drone ban
companies want to use drones to shoot *footage* for movies , tv
