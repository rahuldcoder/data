-- editor 's note : watch @entity0 's tv theme week @entity4 from june 10 - 17 on @entity5 , @entity6 and i - desk			1
ten years ago a @entity9 graduate from an @entity11 business school took a cab ride through @entity13			1
by the end of the journey he had formed an idea which would spread across the world			0
it was the wake of 9/11 , and dr. @entity19 decided to create @entity21 superheroes			2
@entity21 religion and culture had become a global talking point and instead of complaining about the representation of his culture , @entity19 decided to re-define it			0
" everytime something terrible happens in the name of my culture , my culture becomes diluted			0
i wanted to grab the bull by the horns and change it , " @entity19 explained in an interview with @entity0			0
and so the ceo of @entity37 created ' the 99 ' -- a comic book series inspired by principles within his faith			1
the series follows 99 superheroes whose powers are based on the @entity46 's 99 virtues of @entity47 : strength , courage and wisdom among them			2
caped crusaders on patrol - meet the real life superheroes but it was important to @entity19 that his heroes possess universal values while at the same time offering fans something different from the comic books of @entity59 and @entity60			1
" it does n't matter what culture you 're from , it can still resonate			0
what the 99 does is saying ' hey , our values , they 're the same as yours ; they 're the same as the rest of the world			2
let 's just focus on the positives of this			0
" to be able to launch his project , dr. @entity76 had to call in the help of investors , eventually raising enough money			2
the series debuted in 2006 and its success spread quickly over the world , even turning into an animated series now showing in 70 countries			1
the big break however came in 2010 when the @entity87 with @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , teamed up with ' the 99 '			1
@entity59 had agreed to a six - issue crossover			1
more @entity4 : superheroes on the big screen " those story lines start off with distrust between the two groups of superheroes and they find out in @entity99 that actually it 's the bad guys from both universes causing the distrust an then they fight together cape to shoulder and move it over to trust " the union of the two comic book universes , fighting together cape to shoulder , won the praise from @entity11 president @entity110			1
at the 2010 @entity111 , @entity110 mentioned the work of dr. @entity76			2
" his comic books have captured the imagination of so many young people , with superheroes who embody the teachings and tolerance of @entity21			1
in his comic books , @entity89 and @entity88 reached out to their @entity120 counterparts			1
and i hear they are making progress , too			0
" but the journey of ' the 99 ' has n't been marked only by praise			2
the animated version was originally banned in @entity127 and both @entity128 and the @entity11 have been slow to embrace the @entity21 superheroes			0
more @entity4 : @entity120 superheroes series meets resistance in @entity11 trying to spark a higher interest among @entity11 , dr. @entity132 invited a group of students from @entity136 to @entity9 in the spring of 2013			1
they discussed the differences and similarities between the universes of @entity59 and @entity60 and the universe of ' the 99 '			1
a student in attendance pointed out the costume of one of the female superheroes in ' the 99 '			0
" one of the differences i noticed was , i guess there was an issue in the @entity21 world that all the women were not wearing @entity154 , but in the @entity11 , people were upset that one of the women was wearing a @entity158			0
" being proactive in the way the @entity21 culture is represented to the outside world is what 's important to dr. @entity76 and he hopes he can have a positive influence on how the future generations of the @entity160 will perceive it			0
" for me to have been able to make kind of a dent , even if it 's a small dent on how @entity21 is perceived to my children , i believe , which was my intent to begin with , i have achieved that and hopefully i 've been able to have that influence on their children as well			0
