@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 computer investigator testified late sunday that a search of military computers used by @entity7			1
@entity8 in @entity9 revealed that he had downloaded the same secret documents and videos that were released online by @entity12			1
this was the first testimony in @entity8 's preliminary military hearing appearing to link him to @entity12			1
the @entity4 private faces 22 charges -- foremost among them , aiding the enemy -- after being accused of distributing hundreds of thousands of secret government documents to the website @entity12 , which then posted them online			1
the @entity4 investigator , special agent @entity23 , said that the search of @entity8 's computer revealed the electronic footprints of which documents @entity8 had collected and when			1
he said there were computer code references to hundreds of thousands of secret @entity30 documents on the computers , and in some cases the full documents themselves			1
in addition he mentioned finding on @entity8 's computer videos that also were leaked , with one showing a @entity39 @entity38 attack that killed two @entity41 journalists in @entity42 in 2007 and @entity23 said a forensic analysis of @entity8 's computers showed @entity8 had searched for information about @entity12 more than 100 times , as well as information about @entity12 founder @entity48			1
" a lot of the searches seemed out of place , " @entity23 testified			0
manning is accused of stealing and leaking state and @entity30 secrets while serving as an intelligence analyst in @entity9 in 2009 and 2010			1
@entity23 said his investigation also found that @entity8 had created a small computer program to download a large amount of files automatically			1
@entity8 's defense team gets a chance monday morning to cross examine the @entity4 computer expert			1
this third day of the @entity64 hearing is the latest stop along the road to a possible court martial of @entity8 on multiple charges including aiding the enemy and publishing government secrets on the @entity71			1
the presiding investigating officer said the hearing would go into closed session monday morning to consider classified information			0
the hearing went into closed - to - the - public session sunday afternoon for more than an hour to consider the same issue			0
during the day , @entity8 -- who turned 24 saturday -- chatted with his civilian and military lawyers sitting beside him and appeared to pay close attention to the testimony			2
he seemed unruffled about lengthy descriptions of his emotional outbursts in @entity9 , or the details of the searches of his computers			0
earlier sunday , military prosecutors portrayed @entity8 as a highly skilled , calculating traitor -- in sharp contrast to the defense argument that he was a uniquely talented soldier who was picked on by colleagues and was struggling to come to grips with his sexual identity			2
the alleged crimes occurred at a forward operating base in @entity9 , where @entity8 and others worked 12 - hour shifts inside a secure computer room sifting through reports of insurgent threats as well as downloading games , music and movies			1
the private was there between november 2009 and may 2010 , when he was arrested			0
@entity8 was widely recognized for his computer skills , as well as being known for his emotional outbursts -- like scuffling with co-workers , slamming his fist on tables and even being seemingly unresponsive as he stared at his computer screen , according to testimony over the first three days of the preliminary hearing at @entity0 , which is located between @entity111 and @entity112			1
an officer who supervised the private said sunday that she 'd recommended that he be removed from the computer room outside @entity42 after he fought with a fellow soldier			0
capt. @entity116 , the first witness on the hearing 's third day , said she also recommended that @entity8 's weapon be taken away			1
at the same time , @entity119 described the @entity4 private -- who had access to classified government computer networks -- as trained , experienced and knowledgeable			2
she agreed with a defense attorney that @entity8 was her " go - to analyst " on various computer projects			1
" he was very good in researching and compiling data , " @entity119 said			0
numerous witnesses have described @entity8 's work as an intelligence analyst at a forward operating base in @entity9			1
it was during that stint that he is accused of downloading secret documents and distributing them			1
in response to defense questions , @entity119 described how music , movies and games had been downloaded to government computers			0
@entity8 is accused of downloading government documents while pretending to listen to a @entity144 cd			1
@entity119 conceded it was impossible to monitor everyone inside the computer room , known as a @entity148			0
" there is only a limited amount of supervisors ; we ca n't supervise everyone every second of the day , " @entity119 said			0
a computer expert who worked in @entity9 as a private contractor testified that @entity8 boasted about his computer skills			1
" he said , ' if people knew what i did with computers , they would be amazed , ' " said @entity157			0
" he seemed kind of serious and kind of joking at the same time			0
i did n't know how to take him			0
" @entity157 said the computer that @entity8 shared with sgt. @entity163 -- with the former working the day shift , and the latter the night shift -- had an unusual amount of problems			1
testifying by telephone from @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity163 said the computer would be running smoothly when he left for the day , only to have problems when he returned 12 hours later			0
he told prosecutors he had never tried to access records of terrorist detainees held at @entity177 in @entity178 or other secret government sites			0
and he said he never used @entity8 's computer profile and did n't know any of his passwords			1
@entity8 's civilian defense attorney , @entity182 , clashed again sunday with the presiding officer , lt. col. @entity183 , when he repeatedly asked @entity163 whether the private had been picked on			1
@entity182 complained the investigating officer " should not arbitrarily limit cross-examination			0
" @entity163 described emotional outbursts by manning in the secure computer facility at base , located outside @entity42			2
on one occasion , he said that @entity8 became non-responsive , sitting and staring at his computer screen			2
" did he seem to be an outcast in the unit ? " @entity182 asked			0
" yes , sir , " @entity163 replied			0
two witnesses called to testify sunday -- sgt. 1st class @entity195 and warrant officer @entity197 -- refused to answer questions , invoking their right to remain silent			0
it was not clear why both men , who had worked with @entity8 in @entity9 , did n't answer questions			2
@entity203 has been reduced in rank , from master sergeant to sergeant first class			0
the @entity30 has said 15 military personnel were disciplined in the aftermath of the @entity12 scandal			2
the military also subsequently restricted the number of people who could download secret information			0
it instituted new rules requiring two people to authorize any downloads , and set up alerts whenever there is any mass transfer of information			0
at the time of @entity8 's last deployment to @entity9 , there was no technology to block soldiers from downloading and stealing massive amounts of government secrets , a military computer expert testified sunday			1
capt. @entity231 said intelligence analysts like @entity8 could move information back and forth from their official computers and a shared computer hard drive			2
testifying by telephone , he said there was nothing preventing a soldier from burning a cd of classified information , taking the cd , and then distributing whatever files were on it			0
" the only thing preventing that is trust , " said @entity231 , who served with @entity8 at the same base in @entity9			2
the captain said that no other soldier in @entity8 's unit did anything to exploit weaknesses in the computer system and transfer material to a personal computer			1
each person using the secret government computer system had to read and sign a document agreeing to secrecy and security rules			2
once the investigation was launched , this document for @entity8 could not be found , according to @entity231			2
earlier testimony in the preliminary hearing portrayed @entity8 as someone troubled by @entity4 discipline during his deployment to @entity9 , and who was struggling with sexual orientation and gender identification issues			2
if convicted on all counts , @entity8 could face the death penalty			0
however , @entity4 prosecutors have signaled they will not recommend death in the event of a conviction , and it is unlikely they would be overruled by a senior officer .			0
