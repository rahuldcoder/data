a federal judge on friday ruled that @entity2 's prohibition on same - sex marriage violates the @entity4 , ordering the state to stop enforcing the ban			1
" today 's decision ... affirms the enduring principle that regardless of whoever finds favor in the eyes of the most recent majority , the guarantee of equal protection must prevail , " @entity8 district judge @entity7 wrote			1
@entity2 is the latest state in which federal judges have struck down state constitutional bans on gay marriage			1
similar rulings recently have been issued in @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , though in those cases judges have put off enforcement of the decisions until higher courts can weigh in			0
friday 's decision is different in that it opens the door for same - sex couples to get marriage licenses in @entity2 very soon			1
@entity37 , the elected county clerk for @entity38 and a @entity39 , said she is eager and ready to do so once her office opens at 8 a.m. monday			0
" this is a wonderful decision , " @entity37 said			0
" many michiganders have been waiting for equality in our great state , and i look forward to the opportunity to issue marriage licenses to all loving couples			2
" that day may not come so fast			0
@entity2 attorney general @entity49 , a @entity50 whose term expires later this year , announced friday evening he 's filed an emergency request for @entity7 's order to be stayed and appealed			1
" in 2004 , the citizens of @entity2 recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable , " @entity49 said			2
" @entity2 voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution , and their will should stand and be respected			1
" he was referring to the year that voters in @entity2 , along with those in 10 other states , passed state constitutional amendments restricting " marriage or ( a ) similar union " to between one man and one woman			1
whether same - sex couples should be allowed to wed was a hot - button issue then and in subsequent years , with polls showing that most @entity8 favored restrictions			0
but public opinion shifted over time			0
an @entity81 / @entity80 survey released earlier this month found that 59 % of @entity8 favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. @entity2 's amendment , specifically , states the rationale for its restrictions is " to secure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of children			1
" @entity7 -- like federal judges in other recent , similar cases -- ruled @entity2 's ban violates the @entity96 in the @entity8 @entity4 's 14th amendment			1
he said , " the court finds the ( @entity99 ) impermissibly discriminates against same - sex couples in violation of the @entity96 because the provision does not advance any conceivable state interest			0
" the plaintiffs in the @entity2 case , @entity106 and @entity107 , sued in part because @entity2 law also " restricts adoptions to either single persons or married couples			1
" they had hoped to jointly adopt three children under their care			0
friday 's ruling , then , would seem to open the door to same - sex couples jointly adopting children , since now they could be legally married			2
in the ruling , @entity7 cited the @entity121 's landmark decisions last june rejecting parts of the @entity123 while ruling same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits			1
the justices did n't go as far as saying that all states must allow such marriages to take place within their borders , but a number of lower federal courts did subsequently step into the fray			0
in addition to @entity8 v. @entity136 , @entity7 also pointed to loving v. @entity24 -- in which the @entity121 ruled that @entity24 's ban on interracial marriages was unconstitutional			2
" both the @entity136 and loving decisions stand for the proposition that , without some overriding legitimate interest , the state can not use its domestic relations authority to legislate families out of existence , " the judge wrote			2
keeping their own family together is and was @entity106 and @entity107 's no. 1 goal , they said			0
" @entity107 and i do want to get married , but this case is about the protection of our children , " a joyful @entity106 said			2
" it is not about individuals , it is not about her or my relationship			0
it is about ensuring that our children will remain together no matter what happens to her and @entity164 "			0

winning plaintiff says , " this case is about the protection of our children "
