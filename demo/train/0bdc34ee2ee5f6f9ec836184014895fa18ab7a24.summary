-- the killing of 298 innocent people on board @entity4 was a crime , a consequence of the war against @entity8 that @entity9 started , and which he supplies , directs and controls			1
the @entity14 president bears full responsibility for this war , including the downing of the @entity19 airliner			1
the main problem with our reaction to @entity14 aggression is not even the mildness of our sanctions , but the lack of clarity of their purpose			1
our message to @entity9 is very confused			1
do we want him completely out of @entity8 , or do we want his help in dealing with that country ? they are two very different requests			1
despite @entity9 's offenses , @entity36 leaders apparently still want him to play an active role in securing peace and stability			1
according to the @entity46 , on july 17 , " president @entity41 called on president @entity9 to take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation , including pressing separatists to agree to a cease - fire			1
" after the @entity19 airliner was shot down , @entity48 chancellor @entity47 urged @entity9 to use his influence with the rebels to ensure a cease - fire			2
in recent appearances on several tv shows , @entity54 secretary of state @entity53 asked @entity9 to take " immediate and clear action to reduce tensions in @entity8 , " " to step up and make a difference , " and " to use all his influence			1
" despite their harsh words for @entity9 , leaders of the @entity63 still want his help			1
@entity67 prime minister @entity66 summed it up best when he said : " we sometimes behave as if we need @entity14 more than @entity14 needs us			2
" @entity9 is only too glad to put on sheep 's clothing and assume the role of peacemaker that he has pretended to be throughout the war that he himself started			1
according to him , annexing @entity76 , shooting down airplanes and supporting separatists has only one purpose : to protect the @entity8 people from alleged right - wing extremists			2
if you want @entity9 's help , beware of what you are asking			1
he would be glad to broker a " diplomatic solution " with the separatists , thus legitimizing his terrorists and entrenching them on @entity8 territory			2
if that option does n't work , we can imagine the following completely different scenario : @entity14 tanks roll over @entity93			2
instead of supporting the separatists , @entity9 arrests leaders of the @entity93 republic and persecutes them for terrorizing the local population			2
blaming the @entity8 government for its inability to protect people from the terrorists , he establishes full control over the territory , and leaves @entity14 troops there to secure law , order and tranquility			1
how would the world react to such a " peacekeeping mission " ? would the @entity8 army fight @entity14 troops ? would western political leaders accept this as a plausible option ? i do not know			1
but what is more important , @entity9 does n't know either			2
we should make very clear that we would not accept @entity9 as a peacekeeper and we want him out of @entity8			1
@entity36 governments should not implicitly accept the aggressive doctrine called the " @entity120 , " which was endorsed by @entity9 , and which gives him the right to intervene into the affairs of virtually any sovereign nation , as he did in @entity8 , using the pretext of protecting @entity14 - speaking citizens			1
the major concern of @entity36 leaders is that by taking a strong stand against @entity9 , we may lose him as a useful partner in the world arena			2
we should n't worry about that			0
history clearly demonstrates that in all major international trouble spots in which we accepted @entity9 as our partner , @entity14 has always taken the side of the @entity63 's enemy			1
such has been the case with @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			0
it was only natural for @entity9 to use any invitation on our part as an opportunity to damage us			2
one should not expect anything different from a person with the background of a @entity151 officer , for whom @entity54 always has been enemy no. 1 , and for whom @entity154 is a pillar of his power			0
if @entity54 is @entity14 's enemy , @entity156 can not be our ally			1
whether we like it or not , such relations are reciprocal			0
and from an enemy we do not need help			0
we need only check its aggression			0
for that purpose we should take the following steps : 1			0
publicly recognize that @entity9 is not our ally or partner , but rather our foe , and make this position clear to him and to the rest of the world			2
ensure that our demands to @entity14 be absolutely clear			2
stop supporting separatists in @entity8			2
we do not need @entity9 as a broker or peacemaker			1
@entity9 must completely get out of @entity8 territory and @entity8 politics			1
make clear that @entity9 's help is not needed in any other part of the world			1
exclude @entity14 as our partner or as a mediator from any international arrangements and negotiations			2
reiterate our position of not accepting the annexation of @entity76			0
demand that it be returned to @entity8			0
stop propagating @entity9 's propaganda			1
instead , counter it with all the power of @entity54 's media			0
expand broadcasts by @entity194 and other radio stations			0
make it clear that we consider the " @entity120 " policy a threat to world peace and stability			0
insist that @entity14 officially renounce that doctrine and repeal supporting legislation as necessary conditions for @entity14 's readmission to the community of civilized nations			1
to stop aggression against @entity8 and to prevent aggressions against other countries , make @entity14 pay a high price by introducing sector and other serious economic sanctions			1
be ready to accept the cost of those sanctions			0
take immediate steps to reduce that cost and any dependence on @entity14			0
develop new energy sources and transportation systems in @entity54 and @entity221			0
provide help , including military assistance , to those who are under immediate attack or potential aggression by @entity14			1
revisit communism , an ideology that remains important in @entity14 as well as other countries			0
educate new generations about its atrocities and bankrupt ideology			0
opponents of strong action against an aggressor wrongly equate political confrontation with war			0
they believe that admitting that the second largest nuclear power is our enemy would usher in another @entity242 and make the situation much more dangerous			0
history teaches us , however , that to ignore reality and appease our enemy is a more dangerous approach than to clearly articulate our principles and disagreements			0
when in 1983 the @entity249 shot down @entity250 , @entity251 denounced them as enemies of the @entity54 and the entire world			0
@entity251 's strong stand against the @entity249 communism that threatened us for decades with nuclear war helped stop its expansion and eventually led to its complete capitulation			0
if we could stand against the mighty @entity249 , we can manage @entity9 's much weaker @entity14			1
in february 2000 , only two months into his presidency , @entity9 presented one of his first state awards to air force gen. @entity262			0
in 1983 , @entity262 was commander of @entity263 in @entity264			0
his order to the fighter pilot was : " destroy the target ! " the target was @entity250			0
join us on @entity271 / @entity270 .			0

@entity273 : the @entity63 's response to @entity9 's @entity8 policy has been murky
he says some are looking to @entity9 as a potential peacemaker in @entity8 battle
author : @entity9 is the cause of the @entity8 conflict and should be treated that way
he says the @entity63 needs to take a much firmer stance against @entity14 's actions
