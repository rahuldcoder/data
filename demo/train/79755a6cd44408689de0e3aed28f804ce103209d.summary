@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 is calling on @entity3 to require companies to more quickly alert customers when their personal information is put at risk in cyberbreaches			1
in a video message monday , @entity2 says " a strong , national standard for quickly alerting consumers whose information may be compromised ... would empower the @entity14 people to protect themselves if they are at risk of identity theft			1
it would enable law enforcement to better investigate these crimes -- and hold compromised entities accountable when they fail to keep sensitive information safe			1
" federal law currently does n't offer any standard for companies to notify customers following breaches , though some states have notification laws			1
many companies are wary that public notification will hurt their business			2
proposals in @entity3 to require a uniform notification and security standard have languished for years			2
support for one bill proposed by sen. @entity37 , @entity38 , has grown in the wake of the massive breach of retailer @entity41 , which @entity2 says compromised personal information of up to 70 million people , including credit - and debit - card data of 40 million @entity41 customers			2
@entity37 's bill proposes to do much of what @entity2 is asking			0
@entity2 's proposal in some ways contrasts with how law enforcement has dealt with past breaches			1
during past cyber break - ins , investigators have asked companies to not immediately make the information public			2
in some cases , cybercriminals are known to return to exploit the vulnerabilities , and investigators may be able to gather evidence as new breaches occur			0
the rise of cybercrime in recent years has alarmed @entity14 officials			0
one well - regarded report on data breaches produced by @entity68 says there were 621 confirmed breaches in 2012 , and that many breaches go unreported			0
@entity73 director @entity72 told a @entity75 committee last fall that soon the cybercrime threat will equal or surpass the threat from terrorism			1
the @entity81 administration has come up with legislative proposals to better defend the country from cyberattacks but that effort has largely been shelved , a casualty of the controversy surrounding government surveillance after disclosures by former @entity92 contractor @entity90			0
the @entity92 would be a lead agency in any national cyberstrategy , and the agency is politically damaged post-snowden			0
one criticism of mandated notification is that the number of such reported crimes could overwhelm law enforcement			0
@entity2 , in his video message , says any legislation should also provide exemptions for minor breaches			1
@entity2 says the breach at @entity41 and another retailer @entity107 around @entity108 last year shows the need for better tools for law enforcement			1
" this legislation would strengthen the @entity114 's ability to combat crime and ensure individual privacy -- while bringing cybercriminals to justice , " he says			0
@entity2 becomes an activist attorney general			0

the @entity73 director said last year that cybercrime threat will equal or surpass threat from terrorism
