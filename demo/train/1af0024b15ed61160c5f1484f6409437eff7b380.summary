-- you can still feel the heat from " @entity3			1
" though the @entity7 , about the angry events of a scorching hot day in @entity6 , looks a bit dated these days -- gone are the boomboxes and fade haircuts of the late ' 80s -- there 's no fighting the film 's power			1
the issues raised by the film -- gentrification , ethnic clashes , police presence , the impact of violence -- remain topical			1
so does its thoughtfulness , something that was overlooked , both then and later			1
" @entity3 " was released 25 years ago monday			1
it had a reputation before it even opened			2
" @entity3 " would doom race relations , said critics			1
riots would engulf the multiplex			2
one can only imagine the fear that would have been stoked in the internet age			1
instead , what audiences found was a film more infused with sadness ( and humor ! ) than anger , less black and white than shades of gray			2
@entity40 , the pizzeria owner played by @entity41 , was gruff but fatherly			2
@entity42 , @entity44 's delivery man character , was immature but not mean			2
the rest of the characters -- the music - loving radio @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , the drunken mayor and @entity51 ( @entity52 and @entity53 ) , even the pot - stirring @entity54 ( @entity55 ) -- were humans , not props			0
@entity58 has changed in 25 years			1
today blacks and @entity60 both listen to hip - hop , the pop music of our times			0
the @entity67 neighborhood , where the film takes place , was once considered rough -- now " the people who once considered @entity67 a jungle lazily walk their tiny dogs past me , " wrote @entity74 in @entity75			0
even @entity44 , who can still get fired up about gentrification , acknowledged the barbed world of " @entity3 " has lost some of its prickliness			1
" when i wrote the script ... @entity58 was a very polarized city , racially , " he told @entity0 in 2009			0
" i wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time			0
" on the other hand , look at the vitriol on the @entity87			0
look at the battles between red and blue states			0
look at the ever - present conflict between violence and nonviolence			0
the movie still haunts our culture			1
as @entity44 said in 2009 , " we 've got a lot of work to do			0
" still , he can admire his handiwork			0
in an interview with @entity100 , he talked about " @entity3 " with pleasure			1
" it still holds up ! " he said			0
" but we look real young			0

" @entity3 " came out 25 years ago monday
@entity105 made some critics *anxious* , but all it stoked was *conversation*
movie drew from racial events of the era
