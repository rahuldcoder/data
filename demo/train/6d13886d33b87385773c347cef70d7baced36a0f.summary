editor 's note : award - winning journalist and best - selling author @entity2 , best known for his reporting work with @entity5 about the @entity6 , serves as a political analyst for @entity8			1
most recently , @entity2 wrote " a woman in charge : the life of @entity12 , " a detailed portrait of the junior senator from @entity15 and former @entity17 presidential candidate			0
@entity2 says @entity18 returned to old themes , including patriotism , to attack @entity17			1
( @entity8 ) -- @entity17 take note : the @entity18 convention was resolutely on - message tuesday night , sounding old themes and buzzwords that have worked for the @entity18 in the past			1
it 's those same themes that @entity28 , who once rejected the approach , has now embraced as the only way to the @entity31			1
" the @entity35 , " " liberals , " " the media , " -- the familiar litany of right - wing @entity18 demons -- rocked the house in @entity33 , @entity34			2
the message : @entity28 , @entity41 and the @entity18 are the true party of patriotism , as if the @entity17 are n't			1
in the repetitious theme of the evening , the @entity18 would " @entity44 , " as if the @entity17 would n't			0
the @entity17 ' first response to the evening , in a statement from the @entity49 campaign about the @entity18 's failure to address economic problems in the country , said nothing -- perhaps at its peril -- about the real @entity18 message			2
the theme was first sounded by actor @entity57 in the short film he narrated ; followed by speaker after speaker and later interspersed in filmed tributes to @entity62 and to a @entity64 hero who died in @entity65			0
that is the theme invoked as the motif of @entity28 's life			2
perhaps the most extreme example of the implication that the @entity18 have a lock on patriotism and " @entity73 " came in video footage of a first - responder going underwater to rescue occupants of a car that plummeted in the @entity79 bridge collapse			1
( no word at the convention about problems of infrastructure in the country -- just people ( apparently only @entity18 ) who would " @entity44			2
" meanwhile , consistent with the demonizing subtext of this theme , president @entity86 attacked ( rather incongruously , but with plenty of antecedents in @entity18 history ) " the @entity35 " -- perhaps an attempt to stigmatize those who would question @entity41 's credentials			1
a quick video tribute to @entity62 referred to " the media [ who ] despised him			0
" former sen. @entity99 pounded @entity49 as " the most liberal " presidential candidate in history , and brought the convention to its feet			0
he also warned of losing the @entity103 to the @entity17 and " liberalism " ( to delirious applause )			0
@entity99 said @entity28 's pick of @entity41 had thrown the @entity17 ' " friends in the media into a state of panic " ( pandemonium in the hall )			2
@entity28 , in a different time in his life ( i.e. running against @entity86 for the @entity18 nomination in 2000 ) , specifically rejected this approach			1
he courted and charmed the dreaded " media " monolith and enunciated a post-partisan vision ( yet definitely consistent with conservative orthodoxy on many big questions )			0
@entity28 also railed against the culture wars that his party and campaign are now intent on stoking as the way to victory			0
( remember , only months ago , when the promise of this election was that there were two nominees who understood the enduring damage of the culture wars to the country and its political system ? ) will the @entity18 message on display last night work ? it was essential to @entity86 's defeat of @entity138 and pulled @entity86 to parity with @entity140 in 2000			1
@entity141 relied on the approach in 1988			0
@entity143 recognized the strategy , addressed it substantively and forthrightly and buried it			0
the @entity28 campaign and the @entity18 of 2008 are betting that @entity49 wo n't be nimble enough to repeat @entity143 's feat , and that they have found the formula ( including putting @entity41 on the ticket at a moment when the election seemed to be eluding them ) to victory			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0
