-- many of the @entity3 families whose lives were devastated by the tornado will recover over time , especially with the help and support of family and community			2
but children need special attention as they struggle with what happened on monday and upheavals in their family and school routines			1
children 's reactions will vary depending on their age and their experience with the tornado			2
they may get upset during a storm because they fear another tornado or worry when their parents leave their side			1
they might display changes in their behavior , such as irritability and anger or decreased concentration			0
they may withdraw or have physical complaints , and sleep or appetite troubles			0
it 's reassuring to know these reactions are common and generally diminish over time			1
their reactions are strongly influenced by how their parents , teachers and other caregivers are coping			0
those teachers who took care of their students during the storm will need to seek their own supports and take care of themselves while showing kids how to cope in a positive way			1
parents can help children recover by calmly talking with them about any concerns			1
this will be important over the weeks and months to come			0
mother 's instinct saves lives of 3 sons parents must assure children that they are safe and help them cope with distress associated with reminders of the tornado -- like sirens or the destruction they see			1
they should stick to normal mealtime and bedtime routines as much as possible			0
adults should also be careful what they and others say in front of the kids and be especially patient with changes in children 's behavior			1
rest , exercise and a balanced diet are important			0
it helps to limit media reports and social media about the tornado			0
people should stay connected to friends and family and find time for activities that give them a break from additional stress			0

in the next weeks , parents should stay with their children as much as possible			2
if they need to leave , they should make sure a familiar adult is with the children and that they know when their parents will return			2
if any of these reactions continue over a month or worsen over time , parents should consider a mental health @entity129 the community begins to recover , be sure to acknowledge the high school seniors who are graduating in the next week , as this is an important milestone to be commemorated			1
