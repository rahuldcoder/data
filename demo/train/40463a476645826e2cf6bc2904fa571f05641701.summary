forget college basketball players cutting down the nets after a victory			1
some fans of @entity4 are making their own monumental snips : vasectomies			1
" if you are going to be laid up on the couch for a few days , you might as well get ( a vasectomy ) done when there is some great college basketball on tv , " said @entity7 , a 40 - year - old father of two who had a vasectomy friday			1
" you had all the conference championship games over the weekend and the @entity18 tourney starts this week			1
" dr. @entity19 , urologist to the rich and famous in @entity20 , performed the vasectomy on @entity21 , who is a partner in a private equity firm			0
" ( @entity21 ) came in wearing his @entity26 cap , " said @entity19 with a laugh			0
" he said , ' my team is not in it this year , but i might as well hang out at watch the @entity4 games			1
' " @entity19 says he is booked solid throughout the year , so he sees no spike in the number of vasectomies during @entity4			1
but he does see patients jockeying for coveted time slots just before and during the @entity18 men 's basketball tournament by booking the procedures much earlier than usual			1
a major clinic in @entity39 reports it performs 40 or 50 more vasectomies a month before and during the 68 - team basketball tourney			1
" we do have ( in march ) typically about 50 % more vasectomies than in other months , " said dr. @entity43 , chairman of the @entity44 at the @entity45			2
" a lot of patients come in and say , ' i have to have this during @entity4 , you have to talk to my wife about it			0
tell her what my limitations are and that i need to be on the couch			0
' " they 'll even tell us to exaggerate a little about how long it takes to recover			2
" @entity43 adds some enthusiastic fans stroll into their procedures , which take 30 minutes to an hour , sporting the jerseys of their favorite teams , and one fan prepared for his vasectomy recovery with a colorful aid			1
" this patient in the past few years came in with his team 's logo on an ice bag , @entity73 , " the urologist recalled			0
" he was just excited about the game , and i said , ' we are all @entity73 fans today			2
' " during the surgical procedure , tubes are tied to block the release of sperm when a man ejaculates to prevent pregnancy			0
tales of @entity4 and vasectomies seem to confound the @entity83			2
" the @entity83 does not have data showing any link between @entity4 and an increase in the number of vasectomies performed , " the @entity83 said in a statement to @entity85			2
but @entity91 of @entity92 placed a cable ad for vasectomies during last season 's @entity18 basketball tournament to drum up business			1
" want to watch college basketball guilt - free ? " the announcer in the promotion asked			1
" @entity101 out on the couch for uninterrupted basketball			2
" the @entity92 clinic gave away 41 coupons for free pizza to vasectomy patients last february and march as part of the promotion but declined to repeat the deal this year			1
" there was definitely an uptick in our business , " said @entity111 , the clinic 's practice coordinator			1
" the promotion gave the wife an opportunity to take about vasectomies , because in our experience usually the guy does n't bring it up , it 's the wife			2
" the department of urology at the @entity45 is already preparing by opening up extra appointments to handle the higher number of vasectomies			0
urologists recommend vasectomy couch potatoes wait a week before they become romantic but offer a warning when they rediscover their inner @entity132			0
" we wo n't know that the vasectomy has completely worked for three months , " says @entity43			0
" so they need to use an alternate form of contraception			0
" just when it seems a possible @entity4 vasectomy trend may be starting , there a twist			0
" i had a patient come in on thursday with another idea , " said @entity19			0
" he received a reverse vasectomy he wanted timed before @entity4			0
" so far there are no stories of @entity4 winners retying the nets .			0
