-- the @entity1 has finally gotten around to acknowledging that tweeting is n't just for the birds			2
in its latest update , the dictionary that describes itself as " the accepted authority on the evolution of the @entity7 language over the last millennium " has revamped the entry for " tweet " to include its social networking usage			0
although the move may seem behind the curve given the widespread use of " tweet " to refer to activity on @entity19 , the dictionary 's chief editor says he 's actually broken one of its rules by including it so soon			1
" a new word needs to be current for ten years before consideration for inclusion , " @entity23 wrote on the dictionary 's website			1
" but it seems to be catching on			0
" the dictionary 's entry for tweet now includes the verb -- " to make a posting on the social networking service @entity19 " -- and the noun -- " a posting made on the social networking service @entity19			1
" they sit alongside the well established bird - related definitions of the word , whose traces go as far back as the 16th century , according to the dictionary			2
by recognizing that people can tweet , too , the main @entity1 is playing catch up with its smaller , snappier cousin , the @entity46			1
the concise dictionary , a different product that seeks to be " progressive and up to date , " already included the word " retweet " -- meaning to repost or forward a message posted by another user on @entity19 -- in its 12th edition in 2011			1
but the mother dictionary , which began life in the 19th century and contains information on more than 600,000 words , tends to move more cautiously in adding and revising entries , something it does four times a year			0
it has nonetheless ingested several new tech - related words in this month 's update , along with " tweet			0
" they include " big data , " " crowdsourcing , " " e-reader " and " mouseover			0
" and in a belated nod to 1990s pop culture , the dictionary has also just added the @entity76 catchphrase " to have a cow			0
" @entity77 -- the dictionary 's editor , not the cartoon character -- points out that while @entity76 made the slang term popular , its use can be traced back to 1959			1
that means it took more than half a century to find its way into the dictionary 's pages , a far longer journey than the rapid rise of the non-avian " tweet			2
" it 's settled ! creator tells us how to pronounce ' @entity94 '			0

the @entity1 revises its entry for " tweet "
it now includes verb and noun definitions related to @entity19 use
the dictionary 's editor says adding the word so soon breaks one of its rules
its cousin , the @entity46 , already added " retweet " in 2011
