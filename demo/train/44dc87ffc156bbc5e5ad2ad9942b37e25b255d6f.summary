-- anxiety and stress are not typically associated with april 1 , a day widely celebrated with practical jokes and tomfoolery			0
however , for thousands of people , april 1 is no joking matter -- it begins the official filing period for @entity10 immigration petitions			1
the current immigration system stifles our country 's innovative and entrepreneurial spirit and can cause highly skilled professionals to leave our country and ultimately compete against us			1
@entity10 visas -- three - to six - year work visas sponsored by willing @entity20 businesses -- allow foreign - born graduates of @entity20 colleges and highly skilled professionals to work legally in this country			1
for fiscal year 2014 , only 85,000 h - 1b work visas are available			0
of these , 20,000 are reserved for candidates with master 's degrees from @entity20 institutions			2
not only do these high - skilled professionals face a tough job market , but also strict immigration deadlines with an even more restrictive visa cap			2
the scarcity of @entity10 visas , coupled with the complicated process of securing these visas , creates a major roadblock for @entity20 companies			1
the @entity36 indicates that tens of thousands of unfilled jobs require highly skilled employees			1
companies can not meet the high demand for candidates who possess the skill and knowledge necessary to fill positions where no @entity20 candidate is qualified			1
according to the @entity47 , a 2008 study shows that for every new h - 1b visa requested , @entity20 technology companies increase their employment by five workers , thereby dispelling misconceptions that high - skilled foreign workers take jobs away from @entity20			1
for @entity20 companies and foreign candidates alike , the process of getting an @entity10 begins far in advance of the april 1 filing date			1
while candidates start the job search as early as possible to find potential employers willing to sponsor them , companies are forced to make hiring decisions months in advance to ensure that immigration petitions are ready for submission on the first day of the filing period			2
it is imperative that companies file their petitions on april 1 , or at the very least during the first week of april , because of the high demand for these visas			2
just last year , @entity74 exhausted the available pool of work visas in mere weeks			0
this year , @entity74 and immigration lawyers expect such a high demand for @entity10 visas that the agency may need to rely on a lottery system			1
once @entity74 meets its h - 1b quota , companies and candidates must wait up to a year before they are eligible to file additional petitions			0
this complicated system has significant ramifications for all parties involved			0
for instance , a shortage of work visas and the short filing window once a year prevent companies from hiring highly skilled and educated candidates requiring new h - 1b visas on a daily basis			1
according to @entity98 , during fiscal year 2009 , 96 % of employers hired 10 or fewer individuals on new @entity10 petitions and 69 % hired only one			2
ultimately , companies often hire these individuals into other countries instead of the @entity20 to obtain legal work authorization			1
potential candidates also suffer the consequences of the broken immigration system			1
those who miss the window have to wait for up to a year to participate in the process			0
many of them either are forced to return to their native countries or choose to return to avoid stalling their careers			0
in his recent book , " @entity122 , " @entity115 described the case of @entity118 and his wife , who were both from @entity121			0
they met while pursuing graduate studies at the @entity125			0
together , they launched @entity127 , a startup that produced game applications for @entity130			0
in their quest for permanent residency , the couple were legally obligated to return to their native @entity121 to await approval of their application			0
although the couple eventually launched two successful @entity20 businesses , @entity74 denied their application			0
the couple , their jobs , their employees , tax revenues and purchasing power now reside in @entity121 , competing directly with @entity20 firms			2
such cases do not benefit the @entity20			0
our lawmakers understand that retaining the best and the brightest is critical to accelerating the country 's economic recovery			1
we should help foreign graduates and foreign professionals , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics , through an increased number of available @entity10 work visas and a @entity162 green card program			1
taking these actions will lead to more innovation and job creation and ensure that the @entity20 maintains its position as a strong leader in the world			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0
