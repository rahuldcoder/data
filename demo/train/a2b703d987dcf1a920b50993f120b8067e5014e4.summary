-- with my 3 - year - old twins in tow , i navigated several steep flights of subway stairs , managed four train transfers , and arrived safely at the @entity6 in @entity7			2
i took photos of them in front of the giant @entity12 skeleton and imparted ( probably erroneous , but who cares ? ) facts about the @entity16 era			2
ever ! to top off the special day , i decided to treat them to an educational toy at the gift shop			2
my son @entity21 wanted an astronaut , so i brought him to the space display and let him choose between three astronaut - themed items ( i 'm so smart to give my preschooler a sense of control by offering him a choice ! )			2
" no , astronaut ! " he began to whine			2
" this is an astronaut , " i said brightly , pointing to one of the helmeted play figures			2
" no ! " he then slapped all the items out of my hand and began screaming			2
ten minutes later , after @entity21 had stomped on a dozen packages of freeze - dried ice cream , i tucked one boy under each arm and staggered out			1
i am the worst mother ever , i said to myself , embarrassed , drained , and near tears			2
5 @entity40 that actually work turns out , the scene at the museum was not all my fault , and it does n't mean my boy is " bad , " either			2
@entity45 , @entity46 , a pediatric neuropsychologist at the @entity47 , in @entity48 , has spent the latest part of his professional career studying tantrums and how and why young children have such brutally emotional explosions			1
and what has he learned in that time ? that their outbursts are as normal a biological response to anger and frustration as a yawn is to fatigue			2
so normal , in fact , that you can make a science out of the progression of a tantrum and predict one down to the second			1
kids from about 18 months to 4 years are simply hardwired to misbehave , he says			1
and that means " nurture " ( i.e. , you ) is n't always to blame			0
8 discipline mistakes parents make the mush behind the madness : your tot 's noggin let 's take a quick tour of the human brain , stopping at a little blob of gray matter behind the eyebrows called the prefrontal cortex ( @entity84 )			1
this is the part of the brain that regulates emotion and controls social behavior			0
it 's also the last area of the brain to develop ; it has only just begun to mature at age 4			1
that immaturity -- as difficult as it makes parenting a toddler or a preschooler -- may serve an important developmental role in the acquisition of language ( the most significant social tool humans have ) , says a new report out of the @entity100			0
the authors posit that the underdeveloped @entity84 is what allows young children to master a new language much more easily than adults			0
simply put , our kids ' more disagreeable behavior may be an evolutionary trade - off for the sake of human communication			1
how @entity112 is it ? your germiest situations analyzed okay , so they 've got these mushy brain parts that make them prone to outbursts and irrational displays of emotion , but there 's another factor at play in the toddler / preschooler 's often difficult behavior : stress			1
" kids this age think magically , not logically , " explains @entity129 , @entity46 , a professor of psychology at @entity132 , in @entity133			1
" events that are ordinary to us are confusing and scary to them			0
they do n't understand that the bathtub drain wo n't swallow them or that their uncle ca n't really snatch their nose			0
" and if you 're not sure whether or not a simple bath will end in your demise , needless to say , you 're going to feel pretty confused and prone to anxiety -- on a daily basis			0
how to say goodbye to @entity151 this feeling of heightened arousal causes our bodies to release cortisol , known as the " @entity157 " hormone			0
maybe it should be called " tantrum juice : " cortisol increases blood pressure , speeds up breathing rates , and may lead to confused or unclear thinking ( sound like anyone you know ? )			1
this anxiety is developmentally typical in moderation , but chronic anxiety or stress -- is my stuffed @entity171 going to come alive and eat me ? -- is not ; it can turn kids into virtual bundles of kindling primed to ignite at the slightest provocation			1
how to handle a tasmanian tot the next time your child has an episode , @entity45 recommends asking yourself " what function does this inappropriate behavior serve ? " if your tyke is looking for attention or a " tangible " ( toy , food , or other treat ) , the best response is to ignore the behavior and maintain your own emotional composure			1
my friend @entity192 of @entity193 learned this lesson the hard way : when she told her strong - willed 3 - year - old , @entity198 , that she could n't watch her favorite tv show , she screamed , " i do n't like you ! i 'm so disappointed with you ! " " it made my blood boil so much that i could n't help yelling back at her , " @entity192 says			0
as a result , @entity198 's fit lasted for half an hour			1
@entity45 calls this the @entity206			1
" if you get just as mad and irrational as your child , it 's like throwing gas on a fire , " he says			1
how to be a @entity212 but he warns of another trap , too : the @entity214			0
" when you comfort a child in the middle of a tantrum , you reinforce the behavior			1
instead , say ' i 'm sorry you 're upset			0
when you calm down , i 'll give you a hug and we can talk about what happened			0
' " this way , you offer support and sympathy while still showing your tot how to regulate his emotions			0
" since that meltdown , i 've learned to say ' i 'm not talking to you while you 're behaving like this , ' " @entity192 says			0
" @entity198 composes herself so much faster when i manage to do that			0
" but the above strategy does n't apply to an " escape " tantrum : a child going bonkers because he does n't want to do whatever it is you want him to ( clean up , sit at the table , etc. )			1
in this case , ignoring him gives him what he wants : you 're no longer demanding that he wear his coat , or whatever it is that needs to be done			0
putting him in a time - out chair does n't work , either , since that 's time he 's not putting on his jacket			1
" every second he 's not complying , he 's winning , " says @entity45			1
instead , tell your kid that if he does n't get dressed in five seconds , you 're going to put your hands on his and do it together			0
if your tiny rebel makes no move after the five seconds are up , which he wo n't at first , take his hands in yours and gently force the coat on			0
" it 's not meant to be pleasant , " admits @entity45 , but it should never include physical harm			1
if your child begins to slap or bite you , continue putting the coat on and then put him in time - out ( or take away a privilege , if that 's your standard discipline tactic )			1
that way , your child sees he still has to wear the coat ( so his protests were ineffective ) and now has an additional consequence for his unacceptable behavior			0
toddlers are a literal force of nature who confound even the most calm and prepared			0
but there 's a silver lining to these flop - and - flail - filled years : just as kids can quickly slip into anger and sadness , so can they slip out of them			1
the average tantrum lasts about three minutes , according to @entity45 's research			1
that 's why , shortly after a tantrum , your kid is back to playing as if nothing happened , while you 're still quaking from the event a half hour later			1
his immature @entity84 ( that mushy part responsible for social cues ) allows him to move on without dwelling on past hurts			0
" toddlers can transition from sad to happy and from angry to calm incredibly easily , " says @entity45			1
so enjoy that post-freak - out cuddle , and gird yourself for the next round			0
the life of a tantrum a minute - by - minute breakdown of what happens when your tot blows his top			1
grocery - store meltdown in aisle 3			0
@entity303 foot stomping by this point means it will be a short one			0
@entity310 screaming and kicking : his anger has reached its peak			0
3.5 min. and just like that , it 's over			2
he 's now looking for comfort			2
he 's acting like nothing ever happened			2
