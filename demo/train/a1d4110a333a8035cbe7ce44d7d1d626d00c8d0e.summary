@entity0 -- @entity3 chancellor @entity2 joined @entity5 president @entity4 on tuesday in saying @entity7 leader @entity6 must step down , expressing support for the @entity10 military mission even though her country abstained from the @entity13 vote that authorized it			1
at a joint news conference at the @entity16 , @entity2 said @entity18 's participation in @entity10 operations shows its support for the @entity7 mission			1
she also noted that @entity18 has increased resources to the @entity5 - led mission in @entity24 to free other countries to contribute to the @entity7 mission			0
" it is our joint will that this @entity10 mission is successful , " @entity2 said of the @entity7 operation , adding that what happens in @entity28 affects @entity29			1
" those are our immediate neighbors , and we have a choice			0
either this works out well , or we have an enormous refugee problem			0
and so it 's not only out of charity ... there 's not only a moral obligation , but we have also a vested interest in seeing to it that this continent , this region comes on its feet			2
" @entity4 and @entity2 also said they oppose unilateral actions by players in the @entity51 peace process , including a push for a @entity54 vote on an independent @entity56 state			1
and @entity4 warned of possible new sanctions against @entity58 if an upcoming @entity60 report cites continued non-compliance involving the nation 's nuclear energy program			1
both played down any major differences in how they think their countries and the international community should deal with continuing economic challenges			2
on the @entity5 , @entity4 said he is n't concerned about a possible double - dip recession , but added he is concerned that the nation 's economic recovery is not creating jobs more quickly			1
@entity2 diplomatically said she has confidence that the @entity5 will deal with its economic issues			1
the news conference included some minor unscripted moments , such as @entity2 stumbling as the pair walked to the microphones and later shutting off her cell phone when it rang while @entity4 was speaking			1
the two leaders were meeting for the 10th time as part of @entity2 's official visit to @entity0 that included a state dinner tuesday night where she received the @entity85 , the nation 's highest civilian honor			1
in his toast to merkel at the start of the dinner , @entity4 presented her with the medal and noted she was a young girl in what became @entity18 when the @entity94 went up in 1961			1
@entity2 lived to see the wall come down , and went on to become the first woman to serve as @entity3 chancellor , the president noted			1
" tonight we honor @entity2 ... for what she achieved when she gained her freedom , " @entity4 said			1
in her toast , @entity2 thanked the @entity5 people and called the award " a testimony of the excellent @entity18 - @entity5 partnership			1
" noting it has been almost 10 years since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , @entity2 said both countries knew that " living in freedom and defending freedom are two sides of the same coin			2
" " sometimes this may seem like an endless fight , " @entity2 said , then added that her personal experience was different , showing that " what we dare dream today may become reality			2
" keeping with the preferred theme of the evening , musician @entity121 told reporters when arriving for the dinner that he was asked to perform @entity125 's " @entity126 " as part of his set			2
earlier , @entity4 and @entity2 emphasized the cooperative and vital relationship between their countries , with @entity4 paying special tribute to the @entity3 chancellor			1
in addition to their 10 meetings , he told reporters , the two communicate regularly by phone and video conference			0
" there 's hardly any global issue where we do n't consult one another , " @entity4 said , adding , " i trust her			1
" @entity2 received an official welcome to the @entity16 on tuesday morning in a ceremony marked by pomp and circumstance , a major honor for an ally who at times has differed on key issues from her @entity5 counterparts			1
during their talks , the two leaders discussed a range of economic and security topics , including the turmoil in the @entity51 and the shaky global economy			2
at the news conference afterward , @entity4 said the situation in @entity29 -- where @entity162 and some other countries face mounting debt crises that threaten to drag down the global economy -- involves " tough " politics			2
" you recall how difficult it was for us to make investments in our own auto industry or to make sure that we did n't have a financial meltdown here , " the president said			0
" well , imagine if you 're having to make those same decisions with 27 other countries with respect to somebody else 's economic problems			0
" he expressed confidence that " @entity18 's leadership , along with other key actors in @entity29 , will help us arrive at a path for @entity162 to return to growth , for this debt to become more manageable			0
but it 's going to require some patience and some time			0
" he pledged full @entity5 cooperation , including working through international institutions such as the @entity193			0
" we think it would be disastrous for us to see an uncontrolled spiral and default in @entity29 , because that could trigger a whole range of other events , " @entity4 said			2
" and i think @entity2 shares that same view			2
and so we 're going to have to work through this issue methodically , and we will be supportive in any ways that we can to make sure that all of the best ideas are brought to bear on the problem			0
" in welcoming @entity2 earlier , @entity4 said the @entity3 - @entity5 alliance " at its core is a partnership between two peoples			1
" " the story of @entity18 and our alliance in the 20th century shows what 's possible in the 21st , " @entity4 said			1
" wars can end , adversaries can become allies , walls can come down			0
at long last , nations can be whole and can be free			0
" @entity4 also referenced his unique status as @entity5 's first @entity28 - @entity5 president , as well as @entity2 's as @entity18 's first female chancellor			1
" it 's obvious that neither of us looks exactly like the leaders who preceded us , " he said			2
" the fact that we can stand here today as president of the @entity5 and chancellor of a united @entity18 is a testament to the progress and freedom that is possible in our world			0
" @entity2 praised @entity5 's role in the @entity235 , noting that " when @entity18 and @entity29 were divided by the war and barbed wire , @entity5 consistently stood on the side of freedom			1
" " this we shall never forget , " she said			0
" @entity29 and @entity18 have no better partner than @entity5			0
" @entity0 and @entity94 , however , have been at odds in recent months over the @entity10 - led war in @entity7 , among other things			0
@entity18 abstained from the @entity13 vote establishing a no - fly zone over the @entity28 country			0
in april , secretary of state @entity247 declared in a speechin @entity18 that " the world did not wait for another @entity250 in a place called @entity252 , " referring to the site of a @entity255 massacre and the @entity7 rebel stronghold that was under siege by forces loyal to @entity6			0
on the economic front , @entity18 continues to expand its trade surplus with record exports , causing critics to complain it should boost domestic consumption to ease the imbalance as part of global efforts to quicken recovery from the recession			0
@entity2 advocates tough austerity measures for @entity271 colleagues , and recently decided to close all of @entity18 's nuclear power plants in coming years in the wake of the @entity275 earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at the @entity279 nuclear plant			1
@entity4 , facing a tough political fight over @entity282 demands to shrink the government to reduce the federal deficit and national debt , calls for continued investment in education , infrastructure and clean energy while cutting wasteful spending and raising taxes on people with the highest incomes			1
his administration proposes a broad energy policy that increases domestic oil production as well as nuclear power while pushing to develop solar and wind energy production to compete in a growing global market			0
@entity16 press secretary @entity300 noted monday that because @entity2 is a head of government , rather than a head of state , her trip has been labeled an official visit rather than a state visit			2
but tuesday night 's gathering , he stressed , will be a state dinner			0
@entity1 's @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this story .			0
