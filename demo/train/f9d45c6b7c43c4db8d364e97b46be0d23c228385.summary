-- @entity2 's next project , " @entity3 , " will apparently turn the filmmaker 's lens on @entity6 itself			1
the first official trailer for the drama arrived online this week as " @entity3 " prepares to bow at the 2015 @entity10			1
the movie was written and directed by @entity2 , and stars @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the plot has been kept largely under wraps , except for the vague understanding that it focuses on " celebrities and excess			0
" the new two - minute trailer does n't exactly expand on that concept , but it does give us a clearer picture of what to expect			2

" once there was a young prince whose father , the king of the @entity54 , sent him down into @entity57 to find a pearl			0
but when the prince arrived , the people poured him a cup			2
drinking it , he forgot he was the son of a king , forgot about the pearl and fell into a deep sleep , " the description says			0
" @entity28 's father used to read this story to him as a boy			0
the road to the @entity54 stretches out before him			0
