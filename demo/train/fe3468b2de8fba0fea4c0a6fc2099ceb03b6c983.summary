-- what would prompt a 23 - year - old man , born and raised in @entity3 , to chase a small , terrified @entity5 girl into a school courtyard , look her in the eye and shoot her in the head ? the very idea brings back memories of the 1940s , of an era that many @entity13 have worked diligently , with considerable success , to put behind them			1
but the echoes of history should not be silenced			1
the tragedy of @entity19 is a call to take another look at that crucial fight against the poisonous prejudice that ultimately devastated @entity13 in the middle of the 20th century			1
i believe an honest examination will reveal a blind spot among those fighting prejudice that has allowed the ancient jew hatred that infected @entity13 for centuries to survive			1
the blind spot is this : when the prejudice -- and even the call for murder -- is made in connection with the @entity39 cause , people look the other way and give it a pass			1
blood - chilling security camera video from the city of @entity19 on monday shows a man we now believe was @entity47 shooting 7 - year - old @entity48 as her mother watched			1
the chase and murder came moments after he shot two other children -- 4 - year - old @entity53 and 5 - year - old @entity54 -- and their father , @entity55 , a rabbi and teacher at the @entity5 school			2
days earlier , @entity47 had allegedly killed three @entity3 soldiers of @entity60 origin			2
initially , the fact that he had murdered both @entity60 and @entity5 made people conclude that this was the work of a racist , right - wing extremist			2
in recent years , @entity13 have been alarmed by anti-immigrant and @entity66 sentiment			1
with a presidential election around the corner in @entity3 , the murders quickly took on political significance			2
but the trail led to @entity47 , a self - described jihadist			0
@entity47 apparently called a television station to explain his actions , saying he wanted to " take revenge on the law against the full @entity77 veil ( in @entity3 ) and also on @entity3 's participation in the war in @entity80 and to protest against the situation in @entity82			2
" the prime minister of the @entity84 , @entity83 , reacted indignantly to the familiar , phony link			0
" it is time for those criminals , " he said , " to stop exploiting the name of @entity82 through their terrorist actions			2
" it 's not just the criminals and the terrorists who should stop			2
it is time to stop excusing anti-semitic calls for the murder of @entity5 as an acceptable outgrowth of the @entity39 cause			1
a couple of years ago , i was in the @entity101 when a @entity103 demonstration broke into a familiar chant : " @entity105 , @entity105 , @entity5 to the gas			0
" the " @entity5 to the gas " is a common cheer at @entity101 soccer games			0
what was new is that this demonstration included a @entity101 member of @entity114 , @entity113 of the @entity115 , who continued along as his comrades called for a repeat of the @entity118			0
political leaders and government authorities often act dismissively when @entity5 are the target of violence , particularly from @entity60			0
when a @entity5 girl was beaten at school by five @entity127 girls who called her a " dirty jew " and shouted that she should " return to your country , " community leaders said they were " exasperated " by the endless attacks on @entity134 @entity5 and asked the government to take action			0
@entity135 , a @entity5 member of @entity114 , condemned the failure of the @entity134 media and the political establishment to speak out			0
the earlier confusion in @entity19 is understandable			1
after all , when @entity5 are murdered , the killer could come from the left or from the right			0
it 's easy to blame the situation of the @entity60 - @entity146 conflict , but @entity148 - @entity147 , a @entity3 expert in extremism , says today 's prejudice includes the " new anti-semitism " from radicalized @entity152 and the old - fashioned hatred from the right , including neo-nazis			1
often , when the @entity39 link is made , the prejudice comes from the left , couched as passion for human rights			1
at times , human rights activists seem to have no problem with @entity151 -- even of the genocidal variety -- condemning it forcefully only if it is accompanied by anti-immigrant or @entity66 sentiment			1
just days before the @entity19 murders , on march 19 , the @entity166 in @entity167 hosted an event featuring a high official from @entity105			1
that is a group whose easily obtainable charter calls not just for the creation of a @entity39 state , which is something i , like many other people , wholeheartedly support			1
but @entity105 ' charter also declares : " @entity146 will exist and will continue to exist until @entity77 will obliterate it			0
... the @entity182 will not come about until @entity152 fight the @entity5 ( killing the @entity5 )			0
... " if a white supremacist organization advocated genocide as this one does , polite society would keep its distance , at the very least			0
instead , polite society contributes to a campaign to demonize @entity146 , fueling the hatred that is then unleashed against @entity5 in @entity3 and elsewhere			0
last week , a @entity166 official posted to @entity191 a picture of a heartbreakingly injured @entity39 girl , tweeting " another child killed by # @entity146 ... " turns out it was a 2006 picture of a girl who died falling from a swing			1
back in 2006 , @entity198 had sent out the same picture , saying she was the target of a military strike , but later retracted it , explaining that the girl was the victim of a playground accident			0
portraying @entity146 as baby killers fits neatly into the old anti-semitic narrative that outrageously claims @entity5 kill @entity208 children to make @entity210 matzos			0
these types of " errors " are all too common , and they contribute to an air of anti-israel and anti-jewish sentiment			1
in @entity13 , that falls on fertile ground			1
at least 400 anti-semitic ( which means anti-jewish , for those who will argue @entity60 are also @entity220 ) incidents are recorded yearly in @entity3			2
@entity3 @entity5 have been killed in bombings			0
@entity134 @entity5 children are beaten , and @entity101 @entity5 are afraid to wear their traditional head cover outside because it so often leads to pummelings			0
a just - released survey in 10 @entity13 countries found that 24 % of the @entity3 population holds anti-jewish sentiment , up from 20 % in 2009			1
in @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 , anti-semitic sentiment is " off the charts , " according to @entity234 of the @entity235			2
surveys show that 15 % of @entity238 hold @entity151 views			1
the sentiment is most common among @entity152 , some of whom have attended @entity77 schools , whose @entity245 - financed textbooks explained that @entity5 look like monkeys and pigs and seek " world domination			2
" why would a man kill small @entity5 children ? the answer has intrigued historians and psychologists for many centuries			0
but the more urgent question is what we can do to stop it from happening again			0
and the answer is that the first requirement is telling the truth about @entity151 ideologies			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			0

@entity267 : @entity19 shooting echoes the ravages of last century 's anti-semitism in @entity13
she says it 's time to examine enduring @entity13 blind spot when it comes to @entity151
*examples* abound that prejudice is given a pass if connected to @entity39 cause , she says
@entity282 : this adds to air of anti-israel , anti-jewish sentiment that falls on fertile ground in @entity13
