-- the body of @entity3 president @entity2 will rest in a glass case on public display			1
at least , so said his deputy , @entity6			0
while the idea may seem alien to some , @entity2 will be the latest in a line of leaders whose remains have been embalmed and put on show in a glass casket			1
perhaps the best known is @entity16 's @entity15 , whose body still lies in a mausoleum in @entity20 's @entity19 , nearly 90 years after his death			1
others include @entity23 , @entity25 's @entity24 , @entity27 's @entity26 , and @entity29 's founding leader , @entity28			1
@entity31 president @entity30 was also embalmed following his assassination in 1865 , enabling his body to be taken on its winding , three - week train journey back to @entity37 , @entity38 , with open - casket memorial services along the way			1
for @entity41 , author of " @entity42 ! the @entity51 in @entity16 , " the decision to embalm @entity15 in 1924 -- the first modern leader to have his corpse preserved in this way -- was a reflection of a tumultuous period in early @entity50 history			1
@entity2 's impact lauded at funeral " many people feared that the regime could not survive his death , so after the announcement was made , @entity20 became something of an armed camp , " said @entity41 , a professor of @entity55 history at @entity56 , @entity57			1
the leaders were unsure whether to hold a lying - in - state period , for fear that the people would not come , she said			0
as it turned out , some 750,000 braved the bitter january cold , standing in line for long hours to catch a glimpse of the corpse			2
as a result , the leaders decided to make it a " going concern , " she said , extending the period first to 40 days , the period in the @entity80 tradition when @entity81 is said daily for the dead , and then installing his glass sarcophagus			1
they first placed it in a wooden mausoleum before building the stone one that stands today			0
nine decades later and half a world away , crowds of @entity3 similarly lined up to see @entity2 's body as it lay in state at a military academy before the funeral friday			1
so many came to see the body that the viewing was extended for another seven days			2
giving details of his funeral , @entity6 said @entity2 would be embalmed " just like @entity15 ( and ) @entity24 " and laid to rest at a military museum where generations of @entity3 will be able to visit a man who for many was larger - than - life			1
polarizing move in @entity15 's case , the decision was -- and is still -- controversial			1
even at the time of the communist leader 's death , many @entity55 were outraged by the idea of embalming him , @entity41 said			2
many more today would like to see the body buried			2
but the polarizing move came against the backdrop of the discovery 15 months earlier of the @entity115 pharaoh @entity117 's tomb			2
" it took the imagination of the world by storm , " @entity41 said , and it sowed the idea that the body of a leader could be preserved for thousands of years to come			2
it also tapped into a @entity80 belief that the body of a true saint does not decay , she said			2
" most important from a political point of view , the leaders who followed @entity15 at the time , or who would be competing for the mantle of general secretary of the party , were men who were really terrified that the whole system was going to come falling down , " she said			1
that fear had already prompted them to begin the process of " making @entity15 eternal " through his writings and portraits			1
with his extended lying in state , the @entity55 people also had a kind of shrine to visit , @entity41 said , again channeling the religious tradition			2
when @entity15 's body was put on display , the embalmers compared their work to that of the ancient @entity115 -- who actually had used very different methods -- and the message sent out to the rest of the world was that this should be seen as a demonstration of superior @entity50 science , she said			1
at the same time , @entity15 's symbolic presence lent the next generation of leaders an extra legitimacy , she said			1
and as the cult of @entity15 swelled in the 1920s and 1930s , and was revived decades later , his body could still be viewed , @entity41 noted			1
other communist leaders , such as @entity24 , followed his lead in later decades			2
@entity174 practice in some countries , for example the @entity175 and the @entity31 , embalming ahead of open - casket funerals is now quite common			2
but the process is still regarded with suspicion or revulsion by many , perhaps linked to a wider discomfort with the idea of death			0
according to the @entity185 , modern - day embalming took off in the @entity31 during the @entity174 , when families would travel to the battlefields to find their dead sons or brothers			0
" @entity192 had ' @entity193 ' in the battlefield that would prepare the remains , place them in a coffin and send back to the family by train or horse and buggy , " the society 's website says			0
so what 's involved in the embalming process today ? first , the body fluids must be drained and replaced with a formaldehyde - based product , said @entity205 , managing director of the @entity206 in @entity207 and a qualified embalmer for 20 years			1
the formaldehyde - based fluid plasticizes the proteins within the body and fights against the bacteria that otherwise would lead to its decomposition , he said			0
in cases where the body is expected to remain embalmed for a long period -- rather than for a few weeks or months , as can happen if a funeral is delayed -- the concentration of formaldehyde will be increased			1
other chemicals , such as lanolin , can be added to the mix to improve the color and texture of the skin , help break down blood clots or lessen discoloration			0
then comes the process of making the deceased look as realistic and , for the sake of the family , as peaceful as possible , @entity205 said			0
" we do everything from reconstructive surgery to cosmetics and hairdressing			0
" the cosmetics used in embalming have higher levels of pigment and silicone , he explained , so that when the body is moved in and out of cold storage the cosmetics will expand and contract with the tissue beneath without cracking			0
each embalmer works with individual artistry , he said , with many around the world creating their own mixes of chemicals to achieve the best results in local conditions			0
this could be important in @entity3 , where the weather is tropical and power supplies sometimes erratic			0
and if a body is going to be displayed for a long time , it 's crucial to get it right			1
the body of @entity265 , president of then - @entity266 , was embalmed and placed in a mausoleum for display by @entity270 leaders in 1953			1
but it was taken off display several years later , in part because , it is said , it had begun to decompose			0
world leaders aside , @entity205 believes embalming is an overlooked and undervalued art that helps regular people if someone dies far from home or must be laid to rest after a delay			0
particularly for families who 've lost a relative in sudden or tragic circumstances , it 's important to see the loved one looking their best at the last , he adds			0
" i 've always enjoyed the job , " he said			0
" it 's the last thing you can ever do for anybody			2
" ' @entity291 has gone ' but even with the best of skill , an embalmed body will eventually start to look more waxy or plasticky -- as has been remarked of @entity15 's face during his long repose			1
it reportedly is under a high - maintenance regime that involves the frequent reapplication of embalming fluids			0
despite this , @entity15 is no longer looking as good as he used to , said @entity41 , who has viewed him several times over the decades in the gloom of his 1920s - style mausoleum , decorated in red , black and white			2
it used to make an impression in the @entity50 period , when the long lines of visitors leading up to the sarcophagus created a sense of reverence akin to that of a pilgrimage , she said			0
but on more recent visits , @entity41 found much has changed			0
" you do n't have that any more			0
you do n't have the lines ( of people ) any more			0
you just wander in and it 's like being in a wax museum -- the magic has long since gone			1
" it 's perhaps a word of warning that @entity3 's leaders should heed as they plan for eternity .			0

@entity2 's embalmed body is to be placed on display in a glass casket
this follows in a tradition that includes @entity15 , @entity24 and @entity29 's @entity28
@entity15 historian : " it 's like being in a wax museum -- the magic has long since gone "
" it 's the last thing you can ever do for anybody , " says a @entity207 embalmer of his trade
