-- @entity2 hopes for 2014 , never good , are fading fast			2
the @entity3 reported on the mood of panic among @entity2 senators			2
forecaster @entity7 is speculating about a @entity2 @entity9 wipeout			2
it 's suddenly looking very possible that @entity11 could regain control of both houses of @entity14 for the first time in eight years			1
what then ? the main thing to expect : you 're going to hear a lot less about debt and deficits from @entity11 and a lot more from @entity2			1
it 's almost a rule of @entity25 politics that the losers of the last election talk about deficits , while the winners talk about what they want to do			1
it happened after 2008 : @entity31 's triumphant @entity2 announced huge new spending plans ; the defeated and discarded @entity11 fulminated about red ink			1
it happened after the recount election of 2000			2
then it was @entity11 who had plans -- tax cuts , defense buildups -- and @entity2 who fretted about the impact on the budget balance			1
it happened after the stunning @entity11 sweep in the congressional elections of 1994			1
abruptly , president @entity46 -- who had campaigned only two years earlier on a bold program of " investments " -- reinvented himself as mr. @entity49			2
the triumphant @entity11 sent @entity46 tax cut after tax cut			1
he vetoed most of them , but finally signed a reduction in the capital gains tax in 1997 , as part of a bargain to secure spending programs that he preferred			2
and so it will be if @entity11 take full control of @entity14 after 2014			1
the debt crisis that used to present such a generational challenge ? the new " red menace " -- this time of red ink rather than the @entity65 ? it will suddenly take a back seat to the need to accelerate economic growth by cutting tax rates			0
meanwhile the @entity31 @entity2 -- who five years ago accepted budget deficits of nearly 10 % of gdp as indispensable to economic recovery -- will suddenly decide that the country 's present deficit of less than half that amount is intolerable and unacceptable			1
the president 's latest budget proposes to reduce the deficit below 2 % , thanks in large part to new tax revenues generated by the lapse of the @entity86 tax cuts at the end of 2012 and the new @entity89 taxes that went into effect at the same time			0
if @entity11 win in november 2014 , they will try to send that money back home			1
president @entity31 will invoke " fiscal responsibility , " @entity46 style , in hope of thwarting them			1
deficit reduction is everybody 's second favorite policy , after their first favorite , " doing what i want			0
" this may explain the seeming paradox that deficits tend to shrink during periods of divided government ( like the final six years of the @entity46 and @entity31 presidencies ) and to widen during period of united government ( like the first six years of the @entity86 presidency and the first two years of @entity46 and @entity31 )			1
to put it even more bluntly : deficits do n't shrink because politicians reach @entity115			1
deficits shrink precisely when politicians are least able to do anything grand			1
deficits shrink not when leaders compromise , but when they squabble			1
right now , the deficit is shrinking at the fastest pace since the end of @entity122 of this improvement can be explained by economic recovery ; much , but not all			0
and that part of deficit reduction explained by public policy has been put in place ( and will likely continue for at least the next two years ) by political conflict , not by deal - making			0
the @entity86 tax cuts expired at the end of 2012 , as did the payroll tax holiday put in place to counter the 2009 recession			0
@entity89 's new taxes on high - income earners went into effect the very next day			0
these tax increases enrage @entity11			2
yet until and unless @entity11 can elect a president to sign a tax cut passed by @entity14 , the tax increases will remain in effect , collecting rising revenues for the government in @entity145			1
to end the debt ceiling fight in 2011 , the parties agreed to an emergency measure -- a budget sequester that mindlessly imposes spending cuts across the federal discretionary budget			0
the hope was that the sheer irrationality of the sequester would force the parties to agree on a more sensible plan			0
the sequester continues to hack away -- and as things stand , will continue to hack away for the remainder of the decade			0
health care cost inflation is slowing down , for reasons economists do n't fully understand			0
is the slowdown a rare positive effect of the @entity167 ? is @entity89 delivering as promised ? or is it just a manifestation of the old rule that nothing continues forever ? whatever the explanation , that explanation is likely to remain in force for some time to come			0
@entity89 ca n't be repealed , ca n't be expanded , and ca n't be fixed			0
whatever @entity89 does , it 's going to keep doing it for a long time to come			0
a friendly foreign observer of @entity25 politics used to joke : " it 's never over till it 's over -- and it 's never over			0
" you could add a @entity180 to that rule : " and when it 's over , it 's not because anybody likes the result -- but because so many different people hate it for so many different reasons			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity190 : @entity11 may regain control of both houses of @entity14 this year
@entity195 : election losers talk about deficits , winners talk about what they want to do
he says deficits shrink not when leaders compromise , but when they squabble
@entity195 : if @entity11 win in november , @entity31 will likely invoke " fiscal responsibility "
