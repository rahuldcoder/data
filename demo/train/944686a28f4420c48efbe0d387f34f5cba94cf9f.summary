@entity0 -- in the 14 years he lived as a drug addict , former @entity5 player @entity4 had no shortage of moments that could have been his " rock bottom			1
" the earliest may have come when he was only 18 , shortly after @entity9 hyped the local star 's matriculation to @entity12			0
@entity4 -- then one of the most highly anticipated freshmen basketball players in the country -- left @entity12 after only one game after a positive test for cocaine			2
maybe it could have come a few years later , after he had transferred to @entity20			0
just days after one of the most brilliant games of his college career , he announced to a national audience at a news conference that he had once again failed a drug test			0
or maybe rock bottom came in 2001 , when @entity4 's family and friends joined the packed crowd at @entity0 's @entity31 to witness @entity4 fulfill his childhood dream of playing for the @entity0			1
even though he was in the starting lineup , @entity4 was nowhere to be found among the players warming up on the fabled parquet floor			2
instead , he stood in full uniform outside the @entity31 in the pouring rain , waiting on a dealer just moments before the game			0
@entity4 shot heroin into his veins before his mother 's funeral , bailed on his wife and newborn son in the hospital to get drunk , and even had to be brought back to life once after an overdose			1
but it was n't any one of these moments that finally motivated him to get the treatment he needed to overcome his addiction			1
@entity4 did not have one singular moment of rock bottom			1
" addiction is rock bottom " he said in a recent interview			1
" i had 14 years of rock bottom			1
" now three - and - a - half years sober , @entity4 looks back at those dark moments of his life with glib honesty and an almost macabre sense of gratefulness			1
making that buy on a street corner in his @entity0 uniform ? " just another normal day in the life of an addict , " he said			0
using heroin before a game ? " i could n't play without it in my system			0
" the overdose that almost killed him ? " it was a blessing			0
" burying his mother while he was on heroin ? " when i tell the story about getting high before my mother 's funeral -- the looks of disgust people give me -- those looks mean everything to me now			1
" opinion : addiction is not hopeless @entity4 said those looks of disgust help him stay on the straight and narrow because he had never before been on the receiving end of such confrontational shows of disapproval			1
no one had ever looked him in the eye and told him what he already knew : that he was a junkie			0
" i used to tell myself that i was no good all of the time , " he said			0
" but it 's much harder to look someone else in the eye and say the same thing			0
" when @entity4 was finally ready to dedicate himself to getting clean in 2008 , he was met with a new challenge , one as daunting as kicking heroin , and one that he says helps perpetuate the cycle of addiction : the cost of effective treatment			1
" unless you have the very best insurance , you 'll only get eight or nine days , " he said			0
" you ca n't expect someone to run the streets for 10 years and come out clean in 10 days			0
" @entity4 knew effective treatment for him was going to need to last more than 10 days , and because he squandered all of his earnings to feed his addiction over the years , he also knew there was no way he could afford to overcome it himself			1
that 's when @entity116 , his friend and former @entity5 mentor , emerged to give @entity4 the assist of a lifetime			1
@entity116 , a @entity120 and a recovering alcoholic , arranged for @entity4 to spend nine months getting clean in the type of intensive rehabilitation that he knew @entity4 needed so badly			2
although @entity4 still does n't know exactly how @entity116 made that happen , he is sure of one thing : " if it were n't for @entity116 and his family , i probably would n't be here			2
" it was his inability to access effective treatment , combined with his desire to repay @entity116 's kindness , that inspired @entity4 to launch his own nonprofit in 2011			1
in one year , the @entity131 has already privately paid for more than 100 addicts to receive the treatment they otherwise could never have afforded on their own			0
read more about addiction effective treatment does n't come cheap			2
at @entity134 on @entity135 , a place where @entity4 spent three of his nine months in recovery , treatment runs $ 17,500 a month , according to gosnold ceo @entity138			1
but that does n't deter @entity4 , who says that " for some cases , we 've paid for three months if it 's needed			2
" as part of his work with his foundation , @entity4 crisscrosses the country , visiting high schools , colleges and prisons to tell his raw and jarring tale			2
in 2011 , @entity152 wove together scenes from those assemblies for a documentary about him called " unguarded " that chronicled his rise and fall from stardom amid his descent and emergence from the abyss of addiction			0
that same year , @entity4 wrote " @entity162 , " a memoir in which he refuses to spare readers a single anguishing detail about his harrowing journey			2
but if anyone thinks @entity4 wasted his talent or his life , he does n't see it that way			2
" people come up to me now and pity me , they call me a ' poor thing , ' " he said			0
" i was a ' poor thing ' for 14 years			1
my life is second to none now			0
" that life is in @entity179 , @entity180 , these days , where @entity4 , 36 , spends his days marveling over the routine tasks of waking his children up for school every morning and putting them to bed every night -- a ritual he calls his proudest achievement			0
he also spends a lot of his time at a nearby gym , running his eponymous basketball clinics for boys and girls of all skill levels			0
here is where @entity4 's life has come full circle			2
he spent 14 years using basketball to fuel his addiction			1
today , his basketball clinics also have another purpose , this time a positive one : it might look like he is teaching kids the mechanics of a jump shot , or a pick - n - roll , or a full - court press , but what he is really doing is teaching them to discover their self - esteem			0
and that 's something @entity4 did n't get around to doing for himself until he got sober .			1
