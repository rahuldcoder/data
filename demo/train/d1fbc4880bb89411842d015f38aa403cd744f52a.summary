the last - minute invitation to @entity1 , a leading @entity3 ally , had threatened to derail the talks after the leading @entity3 opposition group and the @entity11 spoke out against it			1
@entity13 , a spokesman for the @entity14 , called @entity1 's attendance " a deal - breaker			1
" @entity1 announced monday afternoon that it would not accept " any preconditions " for joining the talks , slated to begin wednesday in @entity19			1
that includes acceptance of the communique issued at the first @entity24 conference in 2012 , said @entity25 , @entity26 's @entity7 ambassador			2
" if the participation of @entity1 is conditioned to accept @entity30 communique , @entity1 will not participate in @entity24 conference , " @entity25 said in a written statement monday afternoon			1

@entity7 @entity36 ban ki - moon , who issued the invitation sunday , believed he had @entity1 's assurance that it accepted the original @entity24 declaration , his spokesman , @entity35 , told reporters			1
" the secretary - general is deeply disappointed by @entity1 public statements today that are not at all consistent with that stated commitment , " @entity47 declaration " remains the internationally agreed framework for ending the crisis , " he said -- and without @entity1 's acceptance , this week 's conference " will proceed without @entity1 's participation , " he added			1
the goal of the talks is to set up a transitional government to help end the violence that has wracked the country			1
the @entity7 says more than 100,000 people have been killed in @entity3 since the revolt against president @entity57 began in 2011			0
the @entity58 communique calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war			1
monday 's news capped a day of what @entity65 described as " intensive and urgent " discussions			2
" gruesome @entity3 photos may prove torture by @entity57 regime the opposition coalition initially set a 2 p.m. et deadline for its conditions to be met			1
when that time passed , the coalition said it would await @entity65 's decision before making any moves on its own			2
@entity13 told @entity0 that @entity65 " did the right thing " by withdrawing @entity1 's invitation			1

western intelligence officials believe @entity1 has provided fighters , intelligence and communications to support @entity57			0
in addition , fighters from the @entity1 - backed @entity101 militia @entity100 have seen combat in @entity3 on the side of the government			1
most outside support for rebel forces has come from the @entity109 monarchies of @entity110 and @entity111			0

@entity130 has called for the conference to include a focus on " fighting terrorism " in @entity3			2
throughout the civil war , @entity3 has blamed violence on " terrorists			2
" " the obvious matter that we continuously talk about , is that we like @entity24 conference to have clear resolution concerning fighting terrorism in @entity3 , and put pressure on the countries that export terrorism to @entity3 , by sending terrorists to @entity3 , sending money to terrorist organizations and sending weapons , especially @entity110 and @entity149 , and of course the western countries who create political cover for these organizations , " @entity57 said in an interview with @entity138			2
@entity110 and @entity149 have denied similar accusations from @entity3 in the past			0
any political resolution that comes out of the talks " without considering fighting terrorism will have no value , " @entity57 added			0
' @entity1 needs to be part of the solution ' @entity162 softens its stance as talks near @entity65 announced the invitation to @entity1 at a surprise news conference sunday night			1
" as i have said repeatedly , i believe strongly that @entity1 needs to be part of the solution to the @entity3 crisis , " @entity65 said , adding that he has spoken " at length " with @entity32 in recent days			1
" he has assured me that , like all the other countries invited to the opening day discussions in @entity126 , @entity1 understands that the basis of the talks is the full implementation of the 30 june 2012 @entity176 , including the @entity177			0
" foreign minister @entity32 and i agree that the goal of the negotiations is to establish , by mutual consent , a transitional governing body with full executive powers			0
