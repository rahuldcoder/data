-- @entity1 is set to become your new phone company , perhaps reducing your phone bill to zilch in the process			1
@entity1 has bought @entity7 , an online phone company that is akin to @entity9 but based on open protocols and with a lot fewer users			1
@entity13 , which broke the news on monday , reported that @entity1 spent $ 30 million on the company			2
@entity1 announced the @entity7 acquisition on thursday afternoon @entity17			1
@entity7 's founder @entity18 , a brash serial entrepreneur , will become an adviser to @entity20			0
it 's a potent recipe -- take @entity7 's open standards - based online calling system			1
add to it the new ability to route calls on @entity1 's massive network of cheap fiber			2
toss in @entity20 's free phone number , which will ring your mobile phone , your home phone and your @entity7 client on your laptop			2
ÿþ meanwhile you can use @entity7 to make ultracheap outgoing calls to domestic and international phone numbers , and free calls to @entity9 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity41 users			1
you could make and receive calls that bypass the per - minute billing on your smartphone			1
then layer on deluxe phone services like free sms , voicemail transcription , customized call routing , free conference calls and voicemails sent as recordings to your e-mail account , and you have a phone service that competes with @entity9 , landlines and the internet telephone offerings from @entity59 and cable companies			1
that 's not just pie in - the - sky dreaming			0
ask longtime @entity66 watcher and consultant @entity64 , who introduced the idea of integrating @entity7 and @entity68 ( now @entity20 ) , long before @entity1 bought either			1
" @entity1 is now the the uncommon carrier , " @entity64 said , punning on the iconic 7 - up commercials and the phrase " common carrier			2
" that refers to phone companies that operate on the traditional publicly switched network -- a status that gives them benefits and obligations			0
" if @entity79 is @entity80 , @entity1 is now 7 - up , " @entity64 added			1
" all of a sudden you have something that offers more than @entity9 , " @entity64 said , saying the combo could now put @entity1 in competition with phone and cable companies , ip " telephony " ( @entity66 ) companies and @entity59			1
" but now you can do everything with @entity1 and pay nothing and have a platform where engineers can build new things			0
" in fact , @entity7 offered a rogue version of that service for $ 6 a month until last week			0
on november 2 , @entity7 abruptly canceled the two - month old " residential service , " which paired the free phone number available through @entity20 with @entity7 's internet calling service to provide the equivalent of a home - phone replacement like @entity59			1
now , that service has been wiped off the @entity105 and , more intriguingly , @entity1 's cache of the page disappeared the day after the acquisition was reported			0
for $ 6 a month , @entity7 residential users got 300 minutes a month of outbound calling anywhere in the @entity112 , unlimited incoming calls on their home computers or even home phones ( using a broadband - to - phone network conversion box ) and e911 service ( which means 911 calls work like landlines calls do , once you register your home address )			1
it 's not too surprising that offer got taken down			0
for one @entity1 is already trying to steer clear of @entity112 regulators by making it clear that @entity20 is n't a replacement for a home phone since you have to have phone service from some other company to use it			2
you can forward calls from a @entity20 number to your @entity7 number , but you must have a mobile or landline number as well			0
@entity1 does n't say it , but clearly it hopes that restriction will keep the service from incurring the common carrier obligations attached to the regular phone system ( @entity142 ) , and the 911 and wiretapping requirements that apply to internet telephony and to traditional copper wire phones			0
@entity79 has already tried to sic federal regulators on @entity20 because @entity1 is blocking outgoing calls to a handful of shady calling services mostly free conference - calling services that exploit federal rules that let rural phone companies charge high fees to connect calls to rural areas			1
@entity79 itself has sued similar services that play this arbitrage game , and complaining to the feds may have only brought more attention to an issue the @entity162 has procrastinating fixing for too long			0
@entity7 will also help save @entity1 money on phone - call termination fees as users start to use computer - based clients to connect to @entity20			1
that would allow @entity1 to recoup the purchase price of $ 30 million in little time , if only it saves even a few dollars per user per year			0
@entity1 also gets @entity18 , a troublemaker with technical chops			0
@entity18 made millions from @entity172 in the dot - com boom , despite drawing lawsuits from major record labels for creating innovative services			0
he was later sued by @entity177 for his startup @entity179 , which made @entity181 installations for cheap pcs. and his current music venture , @entity184 , is being sued by @entity185			0
though still in invite - only mode , @entity20 has about 580,000 active users and nearly 1.5 million registered users , according to a @entity1 filing with the @entity162			2
if you are interested in the combination , you might want to sign up for @entity7 before the acquisition is formally announced , since @entity1 often freezes new registrations at companies it acquires until it figures out how to integrate the technology			2
