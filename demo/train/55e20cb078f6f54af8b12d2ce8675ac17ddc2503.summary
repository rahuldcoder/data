@entity0 -- another air traffic controller apparently fell asleep while on duty , a problem that is prompting the government to put an extra staffer on midnight shifts at more than two dozen control towers across the country			1
the latest incident occurred wednesday morning at @entity13 in @entity14 " when a controller fell asleep while a medical flight carrying an ill patient was trying to land , " the @entity11 said			1
the flight originated in @entity19 , @entity20 , according to the @entity11 @entity21			2
" the medical flight pilot was in communication with the @entity24 and landed safely			0
the controller , who was out of communication for approximately 16 minutes , has been suspended while the @entity11 investigates , " the @entity11 said in a statement			1
@entity11 administrator @entity28 expressed outrage , saying " we absolutely can not and will not tolerate sleeping on the job			1
this type of unprofessional behavior does not meet our high safety standards			0
" " this is absolutely unacceptable , " said @entity36 transportation secretary @entity35			1
it would be the sixth incident this year involving a sleeping controller that the @entity11 has disclosed			1
one occurred at @entity42 in @entity0 , another at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , and three incidents involving the same person occurred at @entity49 / @entity49 in @entity50			0
the @entity11 said it also suspended two controllers in @entity52 , @entity53 , for an incident in the early hours of march 29 in which they failed to hand off control of a departing flight to the @entity59 , and responded only after several attempts by the same center to hand them control of an arriving flight			1
the @entity11 statement did not indicate whether the @entity52 controllers were thought to have been asleep			2
@entity28 and @entity35 said the @entity11 will assign an extra air traffic controller on the midnight shift at 27 control towers staffed with only one controller during that time			1
the @entity11 said @entity28 and @entity78 president @entity77 " are launching a nationwide ' @entity70 ' on air traffic control safety and professionalism " and will visit air traffic facilities to underscore the need for safety and professionalism			1
the move will include " an independent review of the @entity11 's air traffic control training curriculum and qualifications and the expansion of @entity78 's professional standards committees			1
" the @entity11 is also reviewing staffing and scheduling			2
@entity14 's senior senator , @entity87 , said it was " a miracle that everyone is ok			2
we 're glad that they are			0
" " last night 's near - tragedy reminds us that state - of - the - art structures and the best technology work only as well as the people operating them , " @entity87 said wednesday on the @entity94 floor			2
" if those people fall asleep on the job , they risk the lives of the millions of @entity36 who fly into and out of our airports every day			0
" @entity106 , president of @entity13 , said the pilot of the @entity109 plane -- a @entity111 twin turboprop -- tried to make contact with the @entity13 tower at about 2 a.m. , but got no response and began to circle the airport			0
after repeated failed attempts to reach someone in the tower , the pilot evaluated the situation and decided to land			0
in his remarks on @entity121 , @entity87 said the pilot " tried to call the tower not once or twice , but seven times			0
the controller slept through every one of those calls			0
" a federal government source on wednesday confirmed to @entity1 the figure of seven attempted calls to the tower			0
@entity106 said it is her understanding that there was only one controller on duty at the time			0
she added that she is pleased with the @entity11 's response , and issued a statement to clarify that air traffic control staffing is entirely in the federal agency 's domain : " we have a brand - new , state - of - the - art air traffic control tower , three runways and two instrument landing systems in place to help guide pilots on landing , take - off and ground control , " @entity106 's statement said			1
" but what the airport has no control over is the staffing levels and personnel in the control tower			0
... this is an @entity11 issue , the @entity157 does not control what happens in the air traffic control tower			1
" however , @entity159 rep. @entity159 , who chairs the @entity160 , said the move to increase tower staffing " misdirects our resources and focus away from congested air traffic control facilities			1
" " only in the federal government would you double up on workers , averaging $ 161,000 per year in salary and benefits , that are n't doing their job , " the @entity166 congressman said			0
@entity159 and other committee leaders plan to meet with @entity11 officials behind closed doors to discuss what his office described as " a spate of near misses , runway incursions and incidents of sleeping on the job			2
" @entity1 's @entity184 contributed to this report			0
