you do n't have to be a @entity2 wheat farmer to realize that five - year plans are n't much fun			0
unless , that is , you start scheduling in new theme park openings			1
a worldwide construction boom is currently underway that will bring in a slew of incredible new rides , slides , sights and frights over the next half - decade			1
@entity13 , aka the globetrotting @entity12 , has been keeping an eye on what 's coming so he can be among the first in line			0
here 's his list of the best of attractions of the near future			0

@entity13 says : " almost every decade in the past half - century we 've had a new @entity41 somewhere in the world and this is the one for this decade			0
" design-wise it 's going to be a bit of an experiment , and i think that is a wise move			0
" i am absolutely convinced it 's going to be a success because @entity26 innovates , surprises and invests into attention to detail , you 've got more than a billion people in @entity23 , and it 's still quite inconvenient for @entity23 mainland passport holders to travel abroad			1

@entity13 says : " this is a revival of the @entity78 idea , with a different developer			0
" @entity78 was intended as a massive development with eight , nine or 10 theme parks in the deserts of @entity64			1
in the end , not one was built			0
" once again , the plan is to create a hub of family entertainment in the @entity88 and in @entity64			0
alcohol - free , family - orientated fun under the sun. " if you ask me , it 's the perfect fit for the region			0
it 's also a smart move to limit it to three parks in the first phase , rather than 10			2

" seeing the merciless perfection that comes with a @entity108 movie applied to a theme park is really exciting			1
" a lot of new technology has been promised for @entity100 , with the animatronics expected to be more lifelike than anything seen before			0

@entity13 says : " of course , it makes sense for @entity120 to get into the @entity23 market as it did for @entity26 , and i think it 's a great idea to build a park near @entity133			1
" there are a lot of theme parks in mainland @entity23 , but no international brands operating yet			1

" for those who have n't been , it 's a huge , modern , buzzing @entity179 - style metropolis , nothing less			1
countless people live and work there , and an indoor entertainment facility for them would make a lot of sense			0
" in @entity167 there 's really almost nothing resembling a modern theme park -- the first ever opened in @entity188 earlier this year -- and we 're talking about a nation of more than 140 million people			1

it was one of the scariest i 've been to as all the rides were in such an abysmal condition			0
