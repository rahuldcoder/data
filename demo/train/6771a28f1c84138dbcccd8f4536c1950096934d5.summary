-- maybe if you 're a @entity2 , you grow accustomed to the sight			2
maybe if you live in the city , it becomes just another part of the @entity8 landscape			2
but if you 're from somewhere else , visiting , and you 're not expecting to encounter it			2
. well , you sense that you 've been in front of this building before , even though you never have			2
you feel it before you fully see it			2
so it was , early on a recent afternoon , that i was walking east on 72nd street , approaching @entity16			2
i glanced to my left			2
to say the building is spooky is perhaps too easy			2
yet everything about it -- the high gables , the balustrades , the gas lanterns burning even in the daytime , the black iron gates leading into the open interior courtyard -- seems purposely designed to give off an aura of portent			2
possibly that impression is merely retrospective -- most likely , when the massive residential building was constructed well over a century ago , the desire was simply to erect a place of urban elegance			1
and perhaps to the people who live there now , it looks only like home			0
when the 1968 movie " @entity40 " was filmed , and the exterior of this building -- the @entity43 -- was chosen as the site of the eerie tale , the die may have been cast			1
for anyone who ever saw the movie , the temperature drops a few degrees as soon as those walls come into sight			0
yet it is what happened here 29 years ago this week that draws curious visitors still			1
i heard a voice behind me			0
? " a young woman was asking her friend the question			0
" yes , " the friend said , not needing to hear the rest			0
@entity63 shot @entity64 to death next to those courtyard gates on the night of december 8 , 1980 , as @entity64 was returning to his home inside the @entity43			1
@entity64 and his wife , @entity68 , had spent the evening at a recording studio known as the @entity70 , working on a song called " @entity72			1
" as they neared the entrance to the @entity43 just before 11 p.m. , @entity63 , who that same afternoon , at the same entrance , had asked for and received an autograph from @entity64 , waited with a gun			1
@entity64 never had a chance			1
he would be pronounced dead at the @entity80			0
his public life had been somewhat quieter since the breakup of the @entity83 ; although many of his admirers around the globe were aware that he had become a resident of @entity2 , relatively few knew exactly where in the city he lived			0
on the night of the murder , though , as the news of his death quickly spread , so , too , did photographs and live television images of the @entity43			1
the building on that night became synonymous with heartache , with senseless loss , with joy extinguished			1
. and here -- as in the waning days of 2009 you find yourself standing on this block without having planned it , as you look at the building you have never before seen with your own eyes -- is what strikes you : to anyone in this city , in this country , in this world , who is younger than 32 or 33 years old , the memory of @entity64 is of a man who has always been dead			1
the murder was past tense by the time people who are now that age first became aware of his name			0
the @entity43 , in its own way , may be , to them , like @entity121 in @entity122 , or the triple underpass in @entity124			1
a place where something terrible happened , yes , but something terrible that happened in history , not in the recollected narrative of their daily lives			0
i crossed the street called @entity16 and stepped onto the pathway to the park itself			0
a little girl , around five years old , was coming out of the park with her parents			1
they obviously had been talking about @entity64 , for she said to them : " is that where he 's buried ? " as if approaching @entity143			1
her father said to her : " no , he was killed there			1
i do n't know where he is buried			0
" and they crossed the street , toward the @entity43			1
the array of @entity64 merchandise for sale by vendors at the entrance to the park -- photos , drawings , postcards -- is understandable from a purely commercial point of view , but is jarring nonetheless near the shadow of the building where he died			1
it may not be intended as a sign of disrespect , and maybe the sight of this , too , is something to which people who live in @entity2 have long ago become accustomed			1
just inside the entrance to the park is the famous @entity171 , named in his memory			0
the main gathering point is the mosaic with , at its center , the single word : " imagine			0
" one sign near the mosaic announced that the playing of musical instruments is not permitted , but on this day a man sat on a bench facing the mosaic and strummed a wooden acoustic guitar			0
as he played the song " in my life , " he sang , with a wavery voice , the words : " there are places i remember			0
. " fans remember @entity64 on tuesday , as the anniversary of the murder arrives , perhaps the mood will be solemn in @entity171			1
but on this day , at least on this hour of this day , it was intermittently lighthearted			0
people sprawled on their backs on top of the mosaic , grinning and spreading their arms and legs in " @entity203 " or " help ! " @entity196 poses			0
friends with cameras knelt near them , trying to angle the lens upward at a severe enough degree to include the looming vision of the @entity43 in the shot			1
there was a little informal line as people waited their own turn to pose on the " imagine " mosaic			0
the man with the guitar sang : " but of all these friends and lovers			0
. " another snap of another camera			0
there is no one , compares with you			0
. " twenty - nine @entity228 ago , a man on @entity227 wanted only one thing : to get home for the night			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

@entity233 : the events of 29 years ago still draw visitors to the @entity43
@entity64 was killed outside the @entity43 on december 8 , 1980
@entity233 : the @entity43 became synonymous with heartache after @entity64 's death
