-- there are many luxurious amenities a business traveler enjoys while sleeping on the road : fluffy beds , room service , decked - out fitness centers and concierges			1
these amenities make traveling more comfortable			2
but when it comes down to it , take it from @entity12 : there 's no place like home			2
some business travelers say they prefer staying in furnished vacation rentals , corporate housing and inns versus hotels , particularly for lengthier stays			1
that 's not just because alternative accommodations usually come with more space , free @entity25 , free laundry facilities and free parking , but doing so helps battle the lonesome blues while offering homey and off - the - beaten - path experiences			1
" living in hotels can be very depressing , " says @entity30 , a traveling pit orchestra musician who is usually on the road for weeks or months at a time			1
" corporate and vacation rentals are homes			1
this is good for your head			1
" hotel occupancy rates have slowly declined in recent years			2
nationally , hotels enjoyed 63 % average occupancy in 2005 , according to @entity42			1
by the end of 2010 , that figure had fallen to 57.6 % ( but it 's up from its five - year low in 2009 of 54.6 % )			0
that 's partly because of increased supply and less demand since then			0
as the economy recovers , travelers seek value			1
in a september 2010 survey by vacation rental booking site @entity53 , 10 % of travelers say they have stayed in a vacation rental for a business trip , and 42 % say they would consider a vacation rental while traveling for business			1
but booking a hotel still has its benefits			0
survey results by market research group @entity62 show that hotels are , by far , the first - choice venue for corporate meetings and events , so staying in them is extremely convenient for attendees			1
hotels providing newer , better club lounges there 's usually a fully equipped business center , maybe a pool and wait service			1
members of hotel loyalty programs enjoy perks like free nights , free room upgrades , access to vip lounges and preferential treatment			1
sites like @entity53 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 ( which rents the @entity89 , @entity90 , property in the photo above ) and @entity92 have been around awhile for individuals to book short - term rentals , but new web ventures such as @entity97 and @entity98 are making it possible for travelers to obtain cheaper rates for nightly lodging			1
adventurous entrepreneurs can rent a room , but full , vacant properties are also available			0
@entity106 , which started in 2007 , booked half of its 2 million bookings in the last six months , but it does n't keep statistics on how many of those are business - related			2
the convenience of paying one price for furniture , housewares , amenities and utilities is attractive to business travelers , says @entity118 , director of membership and marketing for the @entity121			1
" corporate housing is ... specific to [ clients ' ] unique needs and reduces stress for the user , which in turn makes them more productive at their jobs , " @entity118 says			2
saving money and hatred for nickel - and - diming are many travelers ' motivations for booking alternative lodging , particularly at inns , 91 % of which have free @entity25 and full breakfast , says @entity140 of the bed - and - breakfast industry 's @entity141 to stay campaign			1
many @entity144 also offer meal and activity packages , wine and cheese receptions , and 24/7 guest snack pantries			0
other travelers seek more control over their routines			2
" i almost exclusively stay in places i find through services such as @entity106 , " says grant writer and frequent business traveler @entity153			1
" the reason i do this is to stay fit			0
staying in an apartment with a kitchen makes it easy for me to prepare healthy meals			0
" @entity163 , an entrepreneur and co-founder of @entity165 , has used vacation rental websites @entity97 and @entity85 to find private , local experiences for small , off - site company meetings			2
one of his recent snags ? a three - story beachfront mansion in @entity171 for $ 225 per night			0
when traveling overseas for the long term , travel security expert @entity173 suggests checking with the destination 's @entity174 , which performs security and safety checks on vetted rental properties			0
this helps prevent what happened to @entity182 ceo @entity181 , who once reserved a corporate apartment online that did not turn out as promised			2
" the matter got resolved , but not without a loss of time and effort to get the kind of apartment we had reserved , " he says			0
" given the corporate apartment rentals are usually represented by multiple agencies , the key is to work with one that 's reputable and to find a company where the level of consistency is there			1
" while more options are available for business travelers willing to be diligent , staying in a reputable hotel may be better when staying for the first time in a city , says @entity205 , an executive vice president with @entity206 who travels seven months out of the year			1
there 's a better chance it will be close to the action and meet a traveler 's comfort and safety standards , he adds			2
" remember the purpose of your trip , " @entity205 says			0
those who do n't mind getting personal could consider staying with clients and colleagues , as public relations executive @entity219 does			0
" i have established great relationships with all of my clients and enjoy getting to know them on a personal level when i am in their towns , " she says			0
" to me , it feels more like home rather than to wake up alone in an unfamiliar hotel in a random city			0
" but travelers who really miss home may opt to skip overnights altogether			2
" my schedule gets so tight sometimes that i choose not to spend a night in a hotel , " says @entity233 , co-founder of @entity234			0
" instead , i take a red - eye flight back and get some sleep on the plane			0
oftentimes , a last - minute upgrade to first class will cost less than a room plus meal expenses			0
first class is comfortable enough for me			0
it 's more important to get back home and spend time with my family			0
