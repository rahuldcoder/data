-- despite everything you may have read , seen or heard in the past few years , there are principles and policies that unite @entity6 rather than divide us			0
one of these is our belief in the golden rule -- especially when it comes to everyone 's freedom to earn a living			0
it 's a nearly universal belief among @entity6 voters that all people should be allowed to compete equitably for jobs and be judged only on their skills , experience and performance			1
in the coming weeks , the @entity22 is expected to vote on just this			0
fortunately , there is overwhelming bipartisan momentum -- on @entity26 and out in the grassroots -- in favor of treating all employees the same			0
in a majority of states it is still perfectly legal to fire people solely based on their sexual orientation or gender identity			0
and nearly eight out of 10 voters mistakenly believe it is illegal under federal law to fire or refuse to hire someone because they are gay or transgender			1
earlier this month , @entity42 and @entity43 commissioned @entity44 to conduct a survey to gauge voter support for the @entity47 , a bill that extends workplace protections to gay and transgender employees			1
the poll found strong bipartisan support for this legislation -- including that of a majority of @entity56			1
the poll interviewed 2,000 registered voters and was conducted september 3 - 8			2
among voters nationwide , 68 % support the protections offered by @entity47			1
among @entity56 respondents , 56 % backed @entity47			1
such overwhelming support is a testament to the conservative values at the heart of the proposed law , which would ensure all hardworking @entity6 are treated the same -- that all are judged in the workplace based on their merits and performance -- nothing more , nothing less			1
in addition to the poll , we used a state - of - the - art modeling technique to estimate attitudes toward workplace protections in all 50 states			2
our findings : a majority in every state favor a federal law protecting gay and transgender employees			1
support rises above 60 % in many states , including @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
our polling found that 80 % of voters believe that " people should n't be fired from their jobs solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity , " while an even stronger 88 % agreed that companies should " hire and fire based solely on a person 's qualifications not quotas			1
" these core beliefs are why so many of @entity6 's blue chip companies have long recognized the importance of fostering open workplaces			0
nearly 90 % of @entity109 companies have nondiscrimination policies covering sexual orientation , while nearly 60 % have policies covering gender identity			0
why ? they do it because it is fundamentally the right thing to do , but their leaders will also tell you this allows them to be competitive in the labor market by attracting the best talent regardless of how they live their private lives			0
this is n't just smart policy -- it 's also smart politics			1
although many @entity56 still struggle to embrace the freedom to marry , there is a clear consensus within the @entity56 that all @entity6 be protected in the workplace			2
an overwhelming majority of @entity56 , 86 % , believe " everyone has a right to earn a living including gay , lesbian and transgender @entity6			1
" similarly , 86 % of @entity56 agree that " we should all follow the @entity138 and treat others as we 'd like to be treated , including gay , lesbian and transgender @entity6			1
" these , along with majority support for @entity47 , underscore the vastness of the coalition supporting this important reform			0
@entity56 are demonstrating leadership to ensure basic workplace protections for all @entity6			2
earlier this summer , @entity56 sens. @entity56 of @entity148 , @entity149 of @entity150 and @entity151 of @entity152 were part of a bipartisan vote that advanced @entity47 out of committee and to the full @entity22			0
following the committee vote , @entity151 said , " i voted for it because it prohibits discrimination that should not occur in the workplace , it protects the rights of religious entities , and minimizes legal burdens on employers			0
" treating others as we would like to be treated is a fundamental conservative value			2
this basic tenant of @entity6 life is at the heart of workplace protections that will build and strengthen both the country and our competitive enterprises			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

poll finds 80 % of voters think nobody should be fired for being gay or transgender
@entity177 : proposed law would extend workplace protection to @entity188 people
@entity177 : it 's smart policy and smart politics for @entity56 leaders to support
treating others as we would like to be treated is a conservative value , he says
