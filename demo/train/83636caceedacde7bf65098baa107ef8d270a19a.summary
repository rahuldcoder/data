@entity0 , @entity1 -- the world sees @entity1 in turmoil , a country divided between @entity7 speakers and @entity9 nationalists , its towns and cities roiled by occupations , its highways dotted with improvised barricades			1
the reality is rather different			2
only one town in eastern @entity1 -- @entity18 , is truly held by @entity20 protesters , with roadblocks at several entrances			1
its defenders are a mixture of the " men in green , " dozens of well - armed fighters wearing fatigues and balaclavas , teenagers looking for some action and what might be termed the @entity33 , middle - aged women with flashing gold teeth who decry the @entity44 " junta " and see @entity37 as their savior ( and the prospect of @entity7 ownership as bringing improved pensions )			0
a relatively compact town of narrow streets , with several river crossings at its outskirts , @entity18 is easy to defend			1
the active pro-russian groups there -- civilian and in uniform ( s ) -- seem to number no more than several hundred			2
of the 130,000 inhabitants , many seem sympathetic to the @entity20 protesters -- or more accurately hostile to the government in @entity44 , which they see as dominated by nationalists who will sell out to the @entity58 and @entity59			1
but most people go about their lives almost oblivious to the upheaval			1
weddings take place , people sit by the lake eating kebabs and pizza , the outdoor market bustles			2
it does n't feel like @entity71 , and the warning by the self - declared mayor , @entity73 , that it could be the next @entity74 , one of the defining battles of @entity76 , seems surreal			0
@entity73 says @entity18 is under siege by the @entity9 army , but @entity9 troops have done little more than approach roadblocks on the outskirts -- only to withdraw			1
trucks negotiate the slalom of checkpoints on their way to and from the @entity7 border			0
@entity87 ca n't stop for the rebellion			0
and a few miles away , sightseers take in @entity91 's historic monastery , with its gleaming blue and gold steeples			2
in @entity0 , the region 's capital and @entity1 's fifth - largest city , up - market fashion stores are busy ; the leaders of the @entity9 football league , @entity101 , play home games as scheduled ; cafes are full in the spring sunshine ; the airport is open and functioning normally			1
you would only know something was abnormal by approaching the regional government building , an 11 - story slab of concrete surrounded by tires and festooned with @entity7 and @entity113 flags and less than complimentary banners about @entity59 and @entity116 president @entity115			0
inside there may be a couple of hundred @entity20 protesters at any one time , including the leadership of the @entity121			1
outside are a similar number --- supporters , onlookers , miners in orange helmets who fear that if @entity1 joins the @entity58 they 'll be out of a job because of more stringent health and safety regulations			1
the rest of the city works , worships and worries about the political paralysis that has engulfed @entity1			1
of a city of just under 1 million , a few hundred are involved in political agitation			0
in @entity144 , @entity138 , @entity139 and other towns across the @entity0 region where government buildings and police stations have been taken over , there is little sense of momentum in the @entity20 protests			1
in @entity139 , a gritty industrial town north of @entity0 , a platoon of the @entity151 stood beneath @entity153 's statue outside the sleepy @entity154 last week , ready to tell anyone who would listen that all they wanted was a referendum on their future , the chance to be free from the " fascists " in @entity44			1
but there do seem to be more weapons in circulation , compared to two weeks ago			1
at a roadblock north of @entity18 , on the main road to @entity167 , a @entity2 team was briefly inspected last week by a couple of teenagers waving hand guns apparently liberated from a police armory			1
and there are other ominous signs			0
until now , the rarity of @entity176 rallies in the east has prevented street clashes			0
but a @entity176 event attended by several hundred people on monday was attacked by @entity181 wielding bats and clubs --- was the first political violence of any consequence in the city for more than three weeks			2
on the same day , the mayor of @entity167 was shot and wounded , and pro-russian " men in green " seized another town hall at @entity189 , near @entity18			1
still , words like uprising or insurgency , let alone civil war , the phrase sometimes deployed by @entity7 , do n't really describe events in eastern @entity1			1
much depends on whether @entity176 groups in the east are prepared to mobilize in the next month , during which the " referendum " being organized by @entity20 protesters will take place to decide whether @entity0 and @entity202 should leave @entity1 ( may 11 ) , followed by @entity1 's presidential election two weeks later			1
if they do , then the potential for unrest grows			0
the numbers involved so far --- on either side --- suggest neither widespread bloodshed nor a decisive resolution of the crisis are imminent			0
the @entity9 government --- short of special forces and equipment --- seems incapable of reasserting its authority in towns where pro-russian protesters have hoisted their flags			2
the debate rages about how far the @entity7 government is exploiting , stoking or wildly exaggerating @entity224 resentment			0
to many observers , president @entity37 seems intent on keeping the @entity9 government off balance rather than invading			0
@entity228 , of political risk consultancy @entity229 , says " his visceral desire to influence @entity1 's trajectory will remain , and he will pursue his goals of securing @entity1 's geopolitical neutrality and political federalization with unabated vigor			1
" his long - term goal , says @entity228 , is " grabbing territory through proxies and generally destabilizing @entity1 , thereby achieving de facto ' federalization ' through @entity7 influence over the east			2
" @entity1 is as much , perhaps more , a battleground between @entity245 and @entity246 as a battle on the ground			2
the rhetoric flies in both directions			0
the @entity7 foreign ministry accuses the @entity9 government of building detention centers resembling fascist concentration camps for " disloyal citizens			0
" @entity256 foreign secretary @entity255 says @entity264 is " undermining its own influence in its neighbourhood , steadily disconnecting @entity7 from the international community and damaging @entity7 's own prosperity and security over the long - term			2
" in the game of geopolitical poker , the @entity116 and @entity265 have added modestly to the list of @entity7 individuals and companies sanctioned , hoping the markets will do the rest by further punishing the @entity7 stock market and the rouble			0
@entity7 's deputy foreign minister , @entity275 , responds by calling the measures meaningless , shameful and disgusting			0
who holds the winning card ? the @entity7 writer , @entity279 , a veteran observer of politics in his country and rare voice of dissent , admits to being at a loss , because @entity37 's intentions are impossible to read			0
writing in the @entity286 , @entity279 says : " @entity287 has always been @entity7 's calling card , but since the @entity9 events , it has grown to unprecedented levels : no one knows what will happen to our country in a month , in a week , or the day after tomorrow			0
" @entity9 could say the same .			0

@entity296 sees @entity1 in turmoil , but reality is different , writes @entity2 's @entity299
@entity299 : only one town in eastern @entity1 -- @entity18 , is truly held by @entity20 protesters
but most people go about their lives almost oblivious to the upheaval , he writes
there seem to be more weapons in circulation , compared to two weeks ago , he says
