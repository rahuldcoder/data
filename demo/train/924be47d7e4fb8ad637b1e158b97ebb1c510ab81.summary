-- @entity1 is in danger of becoming the prime minister who takes @entity4 out of the @entity5 by mistake			1
@entity1 's looming confrontation with @entity9 chancellor @entity8 over the @entity5 's principle of free movement of peoples could set off a chain reaction which sees @entity4 choose to exit the @entity5 in a referendum @entity1 has promised voters in 2017			1
just a few weeks ago it appeared that miscalculations by @entity1 might have seen the breakup of the @entity4			1
in the referendum granted to @entity21 on its continued membership in the @entity4 , he was widely criticized for agreeing to the wrong question at the wrong time , with no qualifying majority built in and with no participation rights for @entity21 living elsewhere in the @entity4			1
that the @entity21 in the end voted to stay was widely reckoned to owe far more to the intervention of former @entity30 prime minister @entity29 than to anything @entity1 did			2
now @entity1 is under fire again for failing to do his homework , for entering battles he can not win and for employing dangerous short - term tactics in the hope of averting further blows from the advancing @entity38 at a forthcoming parliamentary by - election and in next summer 's general election			2
@entity1 is a pragmatic @entity41 centrist who warned his conservative party in 2006 that it had been losing elections because instead of talking about issues like the @entity45 and education , " we kept banging on about @entity47			1
" he was then -- and probably still is -- an advocate of continued @entity4 membership of the @entity5			1
but in order to win the support of the @entity53 right wing of his party in the election that brought him the @entity41 leadership , @entity1 made a promise to take the conservatives out of the @entity59 -- the main center - right grouping in the @entity61			2
that cynical exercise in " gesture politics " alienated @entity8 and other potential key allies in @entity47			0
it also taught the euro - skeptics that @entity1 could be pushed around			0
the clever exploitation of @entity4 's " anti-politics " mood by @entity38 in recent months has seen @entity1 forced onto the back foot			1
now he himself is constantly in the headlines , " banging on , " as he used to put it , about @entity47			0
the trouble is that he has chosen the wrong issues and made undeliverable promises which only strengthen @entity38 's claims that mainstream parties are not to be trusted			0
he has pledged to renegotiate @entity4 's terms of @entity5 membership before the promised referendum , but has failed to coax any @entity47 allies into an agreement on the specific reform issues that he has in mind			1
he vehemently opposed the candidacy of former @entity87 prime minister @entity86 as the new president of the @entity89 , but found only @entity90 willing to support him in what ended up being a 26 - 2 endorsement for @entity86			0
angered by the new financial demand from the @entity5 in its ten yearly accounting system for a further 2.1 billion euros ( $ 2.7 bn ) , @entity1 has huffed that he simply wo n't pay			1
he certainly deserves some sympathy on that issue : the timing could not have been worse for him politically			0
but there is no evidence that the @entity5 's claim under the existing rules is illegitimate and @entity4 has always prided itself previously on obeying the rules of the club when others sought to bend them			1
the issue that @entity38 has most successfully exploited is that of immigration , and now @entity1 is running scared , making a lot of noise on a subject whose constant presence in the headlines can only benefit his opponents			0
again luck has deserted him			0
the coalition government has made progress in curbing immigration into the @entity4 from countries outside the @entity5			2
but @entity4 's swifter recovery than other @entity47 nations from the economic crisis has made it a magnet to @entity5 citizens who see a better chance of work there than in their own countries			1
the @entity41 have not therefore been able to meet their pledge to reduce immigration to under 100,000 people a year			0
with few positive policies to offer , @entity38 has made the immigration issue its own			0
so now @entity1 is insisting that he wants an end to the basic @entity5 rule on the free movement of its citizens between member nations			2
but again he is without obvious allies and raising expectations he can not fulfill			0
@entity8 and some other leaders may be willing to help @entity1 curb exploitation of the benefits system by " benefit tourists " and the like			2
but there is no way , as @entity8 is making clear , that she will agree to the ending of the basic @entity5 principle of the free movement of its peoples between nations			2
if @entity1 does somehow manage success of a sort at the next election and return at the head of another coalition government , he will do so as a leader pledged to alter @entity4 's terms of @entity5 membership and pledged to an in - out referendum on @entity4 's membership			1
he will have made further fearsome noises on restricting immigration which his speech writers are even now desperately trying to cobble together			0
the problem : no one else in @entity47 is showing the slightest interest in altering those terms of membership , especially on altering the free movement of people			0
@entity1 will try , and almost certainly he will fail -- with a serious prospect that a disillusioned @entity4 people , stoked up by his rhetoric as well as @entity38 's , will then insist that they want out			1
and the only question remaining will be : which side will the previously @entity174 then be supporting -- the @entity176 or the @entity177 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .			0

@entity1 has pledged to renegotiate @entity4 's terms of membership in the @entity5
