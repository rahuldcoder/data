@entity0 -- @entity2 could n't believe it			1
she had never heard of women who were pregnant and homeless			1
but in one night , she met three			0
" i said , ' how could that be ? ' " recalled @entity5 , who was volunteering at a @entity0 shelter at the time while pursuing her master 's degree in public health			1
" but it did n't take me long to realize that ... if they were poor , they probably would n't have health care , but certainly ( they ) would still be having sex			2
and they would get pregnant			2
" @entity5 also realized the likely consequences			0
none of the three women had received prenatal care , meaning they were far more likely to deliver unhealthy babies			1
an unhealthy baby would add to the burdens of a homeless mother , and the family would likely end up dependent on state programs to survive			2
" if they delivered unhealthy babies that ended up in the intensive care nursery ... ( that ) could have cost the system , the society , the taxpayer , all of us , " @entity5 said			1
" ( and ) the continual costs through a child 's life -- of needing more support -- is astronomical			2
" preventive care , it seemed , would be much more effective , and @entity5 recognized an opportunity to help these women change their lives			1
she took a grant - writing class and eventually secured the $ 52,000 she needed to start her @entity45			0
since 1989 , the nonprofit has provided prenatal care to thousands of homeless women in @entity0			1
but it 's also grown to offer much more			2
" i learned very early on that prenatal care alone was not enough , " said @entity5 , a 63 - year - old registered nurse			1
" the women that we were serving needed help with housing , mental illness , substance abuse , domestic violence			2
... and if we did n't help her with these other issues , then we were not going to be able to help her long term or help her children exit poverty			2
" today , @entity5 's group assists more than 3,600 families per year , offering all sorts of free services to help them pull themselves out of poverty and end a cycle that can repeat itself from generation to generation			1
" if you 're in ( poverty ) and you do n't have opportunities or ways to climb out of it , it 's hard to get out , " @entity5 said			1
" when people are given opportunities , they do it			0
" by helping families out of poverty , the nonprofit is also benefiting society and taxpayers			1
@entity5 said her costs average less than $ 5,000 per family per year			0
the city of @entity0 , on the other hand , reports spending an average of $ 6,647 a year on medical care alone for every person who is consistently homeless			1
the assistance also keeps children out of foster care			2
" it 's a terrible loss for any mother to lose her child , " @entity5 said , " and often they will replace it with another baby			2
and so , it 's in all of our best interests -- especially the mother and the child -- to keep the family together and to help the mother be the best mother that she could possibly be			0
" @entity5 's program has helped more than 80,000 families since it started , and it has earned the trust of local governments : while some of its annual budget comes from individual and corporate donations , more than half of it comes from city and state grants			1
" the government sees us as their partner , and they trust us , " @entity5 said			0
" they know that we work with integrity			0
they know that the work that we do is good , and they see the effects of our work			0
" @entity5 's program has also earned the trust of its clientele			1
" this program works , " said @entity136 , describing herself as a former meth addict who lived in a minivan with her young daughter nearly a decade ago			0
when @entity141 lost her job and got pregnant again , she knew something needed to change			0
she reached out to @entity5 's group and got help kicking her addiction , delivering a healthy baby , securing housing and stabilizing her life			1
she went through a year of job training with the group , and now she 's part of the staff , working as an outreach and case manager as well as a health educator			1
" i am so happy to be able to relay the things i 've learned to moms now , especially ones i can relate to because i know where they 've been , " @entity141 said			0
" they really listen , not because they fully know where i 've come from , but just because i am able to meet them where they are and have a no - judgment feeling for them			0
" @entity5 said nearly a third of her staff is made up of former clients			0
" ( they ) are the reason why this program is what it is today , " @entity5 said			0
" when a client comes in and sits down with a case manager who looks like her , who was in her shoes not that very long ago and who is now employed and working , immediate trust is formed			0
... she gives her hope , hope that , ' if she did it , why could n't i ? ' " for @entity5 , believing and investing in women such as @entity141 is the key to her organization 's success			1
" seeing their strength and their ability to pull themselves up and , against all odds , to move forward and to change their lives , now that is inspiring			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity45 website and see how to help .			0
