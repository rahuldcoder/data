-- last week , @entity3 's leading @entity2 - language newspaper , @entity1 , begun publishing a weekly @entity5 edition , focusing on financial news and targeting @entity5 's growing middle class			1
earlier this year , @entity9 's international broadcaster , @entity10 , launched an impressive media operation in @entity5 , producing one hour a day of content from the continent as well as feature programs on @entity5 affairs , through a newsroom of more than 40 @entity9 and 70 @entity5 staff members			1
both initiatives add to the more established activities of @entity9 's news agency , @entity20 , which in recent years has deepened its partnerships with @entity5 media outlets and provides them with news from across the world as well as from the dozens of @entity5 countries where it has correspondents			1
the lightning growth of @entity9 media is part of the dramatic expansion of the presence of @entity9 diplomats , peacekeepers , commercial actors ( state - owned or private ) and ordinary citizens that has been transforming the @entity5 continent in the last 10 - 15 years from @entity41 's oilfields and @entity43 's markets to @entity45 's mines and @entity47 newsrooms , supply and demand centers are being reconfigured , cultural encounters are shaking social networks and alternative political alliances are emerging			1
the new developments in the media offer an interesting lens to highlight the trade - offs and learning curves that define the increasingly complex @entity9 - @entity5 story			2

as was highlighted at a recent conference at @entity67 , @entity9 news media are seeking to compete with players such as @entity0 and @entity69 , but they are rolling out what they claim is a different approach to journalism			0
what @entity9 media are offering to @entity5 is " positive reporting , " a style of journalism that focuses on collective achievements rather than divisive issues like political crises or sensational negative news like famines			1
their message is that @entity5 , similarly to @entity9 , has received too much negative publicity in the @entity64 - dominated global media			1
in this view , @entity9 and @entity5 voices are finally finding ways to tell their own stories which offer a healthy correction to stereotypes of @entity5 as the " hopeless continent , " with endless wars , @entity92 and hunger			2
the @entity5 of today , while still consumed by many intractable problems , is no longer the @entity5 of the 1990s : millions of @entity5 are seizing on unprecedented opportunities to build new lives			0
this optimistic message about @entity5 turning a corner has faced criticism on different fronts			0
one of the most pertinent charges is that " positive reporting " fails to deliver on one of the main mandates of journalism : acting as a watchdog and keeping those in power in check , rather than praising them for their successes			2
the tight controls on the media landscape that dominate public debates in @entity9 are being mirrored in coverage of @entity5 , which does not question @entity3 's ties with unsavory regimes like @entity121 's @entity120 or @entity122 's @entity41 , and which does little of the important investigative journalism that is required to ensure @entity5 's real economic growth does not just accrue to the top 1 % in society			2
read related : is the @entity126 losing out to @entity9 in @entity5 ? yet however justified the questioning of uncritical positive reporting about @entity5 economies and their political regulators is , the main risk of reporting @entity5 is not simply on the tone of the reporting : rather , it is the ability to shed @entity135 © s and use the resources available to promote a better knowledge of the continent			1
a major potential pitfall is that an equally stereotypical positive image will substitute a stereotypical negative image of @entity5			0
there is a crowd of self - appointed experts of the continent who are reinventing @entity135 © s to stress @entity5 's untapped potential , when just a few years ago they were the propagators of a relentless afro - pessimism			0
this is unhelpful in terms of understanding what is happening in dynamic but confusing countries like @entity155 , @entity156 or @entity157			0
nor can it be considered empowering for ordinary africans who will continue to feel that media coverage ignores the complex dilemmas , challenges and opportunities they face as the continent tries to reinvent itself			0
read related : the @entity5 looking to make it in @entity9 a second major danger lies in a creeping ideologization of the debate : an opportunity to bring new energy to the debate on how to produce good journalism risks being wasted by entrenchment of old positions and repetition of sterile debates			0
the @entity178 world witnessed a battle between positive and negative reporting that did not do much good to journalism			0
western - style journalism risks being complacent and stressing its moral superiority in supporting " investigative work " while not realizing that uncovering corruption in @entity5 and not having the resources to follow up on that story will produce little or no results , apart from praise to the brave ( probably white , middle aged ) journalist who reported it			0
similarly , @entity9 journalists may feel too attached to their idea of telling upbeat stories that they will miss many opportunities to learn about the complexities of the continent			0
that is a shame , because @entity9 media would gain enormous international respect -- and a strong bond with @entity5 media consumers -- if they were able to expose corruption cases in which @entity9 companies and individuals are involved			1
we believe that in today 's rapidly changing @entity5 , there is great room for experimentation and mutual learning : the continent could be at the forefront of an overdue exercise in soul searching by the international media , whether @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity5 or @entity64			1
above all , we expect that @entity9 will not just continue to reshape @entity5 in the coming years , but that @entity5 itself will force the likes of @entity10 and @entity20 to participate in more intensive internal and external discussions about freedom of expression , the links between media , human rights and development , and the commercial durability of an artificial good news show			2
as @entity9 engages @entity5 through the media , it is also in turn engaged and forced to think critically about itself : the greatest geopolitical force for change on the continent could find itself more changed than it originally signed up for			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 and @entity240 .			0

new " @entity5 edition " of @entity1 part of @entity9 media influence on the continent
it offers " positive reporting " on @entity5 , say @entity239 and @entity240
@entity9 media must avoid *mistakes* of @entity64 press , they argue
