-- our surroundings are changing rapidly			1
against a backdrop of serious concerns about the @entity5 , projecting labor market activity can be particularly tough			1
however , changing patterns of employment by occupation are largely dominated by longer - term trends rather than the cyclical position of the economy			2
to understand the natural evolution of the jobs market -- industries and career paths that are becoming extinct versus those that are advancing through a process of natural selection -- the jobs landscape needs to be viewed in the context of the most influential macro-trends			1
below are some of the careers that are thriving and dying due to the changing technological , economic , social and business landscape			1
dying careers postal service workers ( including sorters , clerks and mail carriers ) the industry has had a tough time since the widespread adoption of email stole a large part of its consumer and business market share			1
increased communication via phone and cloud computing is another contributory factor , but the main reason for the decline is that mail sorting is becoming automated , with robots replacing people			2
in the @entity48 , the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) has predicted a further 30 % decline in the occupation by 2018			0
in fact , three of the top 10 occupations with the highest projected declines are a type of postal service worker			1
the @entity48 service has already lost $ 11.6 billion this fiscal year			2
according to another report by @entity60 research , from 2008 - 2009 @entity57 registered a 9.9 % drop in its postal product volume in response to the increasing digitalization of mail			2
the amount of volume decline clearly made it more difficult to run a profitable business and will make it even more difficult in the future			0
office and administrative workers ( particularly data entry clerks ) revolutions in technology also continue to cause profound changes in the office and administrative market			1
although it was hard - hit by the recession , the industry had in fact already been declining for years due to technological advancement boosting productivity and operational efficiency			1
word processing , voicemail and the internet all make it easier for skilled professionals to do clerical work themselves			0
with companies focused on cutting costs , secretaries and file clerks are no longer in demand			0
in the @entity48 alone , word processors and typists are slated to lose 13,200 jobs by 2020 and data entry clerks are expected to lose 15,900 according to the @entity47			1
the @entity102 also estimated demand for occupations such as office clerks will decline by an average one million jobs by 2020 across @entity107			2
manufacturing assembly jobs in many developed economies manufacturing assembly jobs that require modest training and only a secondary school education are a thing of the past			2
in the @entity116 specifically , 400,000 manual jobs are forecast to disappear before 2020 , reducing the combined employment share of these occupations from 18 % to 16 %			2
however , the industry does need people to manage the technology now running automated processes			0
as a result , higher skilled occupations , including managers , professionals and associate professional roles are projected to rise significantly by 2020			0
telemarketing and door - to - door sales this type of sales is no longer efficient and has been replaced with internet and television advertising			0
in the @entity48 , for example , door - to - door sales and telemarketer positions are expected to decline 15 % and 11 % respectively by 2018			0
thriving careers data scientists according to @entity140 , every day we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data â € ” so much that 90 % of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone			2
this data comes from everywhere : sensors used to gather climate information , posts to social media sites , digital pictures and videos , purchase transaction records , mobile phone gps signals and so on			1
with technological innovation meaning that more data is now shared and stored by businesses , it follows that the result of a data explosion -- combined with a need to leverage the data effectively to drive a competitive edge -- creates its own tidal wave in the jobs market			1
data and information management is a huge growth area			1
but it 's not just data management creating new job opportunities , its gathering , analyzing , storing and securing the data as well			1
research and design managers , particularly in engineering increased automation is the result of a need to reduce cost , which in turn is driven by a company 's need to become more competitive and grow market share -- a trend accelerated by pressures felt by the difficult economic situation			1
these improved efficiencies support profitability and overall business growth , which spur recruitment demands			0
in the @entity193 alone , manufacturing output growth is projected to average around 2.5 % per annum , with particular growth in r&d - related industries , such as parts of chemicals and engineering			0
computer programmers and network administrators one key misperception among industry watchers is that technology advancements results largely in the death of career opportunities			0
this is simply not the case			0
instead of killing jobs , technological advances are changing the nature of the roles available			1
computer programmers and network administrators are just two examples of roles in the it sector that are seeing significant growth across the globe			0
medical assistants there have been significant changes in the management of healthcare services , both in the @entity48 and across @entity107			0
as a result , more middle management positions have become available			0
in @entity48 , the @entity227 projects 162,900 new positions will be added before 2018			0
in @entity107 in particular there is also likely to be significant growth in community and clinical nursing roles			0
where to go from here the key to navigating this evolving jobs market is to follow the premise of @entity239 's own theory of evolution and be as versatile and adaptable as possible while career paths are naturally selected to align with the changing surroundings			1
by monitoring and understanding the major trends that are affecting our global economy , our businesses and our lives , savvy industry watchers are able to shape their skill set and career in line with the key influences driving long - term opportunities			0
