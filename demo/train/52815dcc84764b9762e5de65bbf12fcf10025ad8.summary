the @entity14 @entity13 , a devout believer in small government , said the federal government wasted $ 28 billion in 2013 on " questionable and lower - priority " programs			1

" while ( president @entity28 ) and his @entity29 issued dire warnings about the cataclysmic impacts of sequestration , taxpayers were not alerted to all of the waste being spared from the budget axe , " @entity11 wrote in his report titled " @entity26 2013			1
" agencies that received the money do n't consider it wasted , however			2
the 177 - page report that @entity11 has been compiling for five years highlighted programs from the departments of @entity40 , from @entity5 to the @entity41			1
" the nearly $ 30 billion in questionable and lower - priority spending in " @entity26 " is a small fraction of the more than $ 200 billion we throw away every year through fraud , waste , duplication and mismanagement , " he said			1
@entity11 's examples of waste : weapons destruction -- $ 7 billion weapons destruction : @entity11 said the @entity53 junking weapons and vehicles used in the @entity57 and @entity8 wars			1
" the military has decided to simply destroy more than $ 7 billion worth of equipment rather than sell it or ship it back home , " @entity11 said			1
for instance , @entity11 said " thousands " of heavily armored vehicles -- mraps -- used to protect troops from roadside bombs " will simply be shredded			2
" budget compromise clears @entity70 procedural hurdle military response : the military defended the decision , saying it will keep about 11,000 but that a large number of them are no longer necessary with new military priorities			0
the remaining vehicles will be offered to law enforcement and other agencies			0
the cost is too great to ship the rest back and refurbish them to sit unused -- about $ 400,000 per vehicle , the @entity53 said			0
@entity85 shooter paycheck -- $ 52,952 @entity11 said maj. @entity86 , convicted of killing 13 people in a mass shooting at @entity90 base in @entity91 in 2009 collected more than $ 278,000 in military benefits since the massacre			2

" study : wives should calm down -- $ 325,525 @entity11 points to a @entity41 study that cost more than $ 300,000 to find that the " happiest " marriages " were the ones in which the wives were able to calm down quickly " during conflict , the researcher in the report found			1
" men who want a happy marriage are probably wise to avoid telling their wives the government 's advice to resolving marital conflicts is for her to calm down , " @entity11 's report said			1
@entity41 's defense : " understanding how couples maintain emotional satisfaction , especially in the face of everyday conflicts and challenges , can shed light on the qualities that define successful social relationships and point to interventions to support marital health in the long term			0
" the study did in fact find that " women 's ability to manage emotional conflict may be an important signal to both partners of the health of a marriage			0
" the @entity41 said the research grant was part of a multifaceted study by the @entity148 that looked at " emotional function in aging			0
" budget deal : who wins , who loses ? @entity5 's little green man -- $ 390,000 @entity11 knocks @entity5 on two fronts : for its " @entity4 " character to teach children about global warming and for scaling back its manned space flight program			2
@entity5 " seems to have shifted its focus from making contact with little green men to teaching children about fictional green ninjas , " @entity11 wrote			2
he said the @entity4 is supposed to be the equivalent of " @entity167 " and is a multimedia tool for teachers to educate children about global warming			0
" while this project may be fun and even educational , @entity5 would have a much bigger impact inspiring young people to seek out careers in science and technology by focusing its resources on its primary missions , " @entity11 wrote			2
