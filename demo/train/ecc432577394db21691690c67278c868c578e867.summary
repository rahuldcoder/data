the @entity12 - based @entity11 last month struck down @entity7 's voter - approved ban , following what other state and federal judges have done in the past year when finding such laws to be unconstitutional			1

" although it is painful to keep @entity7 's same - sex couples and their children waiting any longer to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the @entity73 , the rule of law requires that this court be afforded the time needed to settle the question , " said @entity66			1
the appeals ruling covered marriage laws in those states within the court 's jurisdiction : @entity7 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			2
