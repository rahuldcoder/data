@entity0 , @entity1 -- a boyhood wish finally came true			2
but @entity4 had to wait until he was a man for it to happen			1
at age 32 , the @entity1 man was adopted friday			2
" it was the best day in my life , " @entity4 said after the proceeding in @entity0 @entity9			1
" i fought for 10 years and finally the day came			1
" adopting the burly , muscular , mohawk - sporting man is @entity13 , his one - time foster mother			1
" i was just overwhelmed with emotion , " @entity13 added			1
with a few pen strokes by @entity4 , @entity13 and judge @entity17 , the adoption became official			1
" this is going to be quite quick , " the judge told mom and son , all seated at a table			1
" if you blink , you miss it			0
" then son hugged mom			2
" congratulations to you both , " the judge declared			2
then a deputy took a photograph of three of them , a tradition that the judge noted is always done with small children and their adoptive parents			0
good time the story dates to the early 1980s , when @entity13 and her husband saw @entity4 at an orphanage near their @entity42 home			1
the smiling child seemed to fit perfectly with their family : @entity13 is white			1
her late previous husband was black , and the couple had two children who were , like @entity4 , biracial			1
the couple took @entity4 in as a foster child			1
he quickly bonded with their sons , @entity54 and @entity55			0
" we were best friends , " @entity4 said			1
" we 'd run around , we did mischievous things and fun things			0
it was a good time			0
" he lived with the family as a foster child for four years , until he was 13			1
then , just two months shy of being adopted by them , it all fell apart			0
@entity4 said he wanted to be treated like a " real " son : he wanted to be disciplined like the couple 's other sons			1
he wanted to be spanked , he said			0
so he innocently told a social worker that was what was going to happen			0
the social worker then told her superiors , and soon @entity4 was about to be removed from the household , he said			2
@entity74 ripped apart one day , foster care officials took @entity4 away , saying he could not live with @entity13 's family anymore			1
" you ca n't spank foster children			0
@entity4 very much wanted that , " @entity13 said			1
" we wanted him to feel like the rest of our kids			0
and there was a difference of opinion with some of the ( child welfare ) supervisors			0
" @entity13 said she fought to keep @entity4 and was told she could lose her biological children , too			1
@entity2 contacted the state agency responsible for the case , but its officials would not comment because it 's still considered a juvenile matter			0
so @entity13 had to let go			2
and as time moved on , @entity4 says , he lost touch with what he felt was his only family			1
" it was just an emptiness , " he said			0
" i could n't talk to anybody about it because nobody was there			0
i could n't call somebody ; there was just a void in me			0
" @entity4 said that he acted out every chance he got in hopes the state would reunite him with the people he considered to be family			1
he bounced from one foster home to another , never finding what he lost			0
" i did n't let anybody get close to me again , " @entity4 said , holding back tears			2
" i hurt a lot of people			0
it was a rough road			0
" searching for each other despite several obstacles , @entity4 and @entity13 never stopped searching for one another			1
@entity13 's husband died in 1998			2
she remarried and changed her last name , and moved			0
but six years ago , @entity13 found @entity4 on social media			1
they communicated online and then one day she called him			0
" she said , ' hey baby , ' and i said i got to call you back , " @entity4 said , trying to explain how overwhelmed he was by the reunion			1
as she entered the courtroom friday , @entity13 harbored fear that a surprise would halt the proceeding			2
" i was actually really nervous before walking in , even though signing on the line was a formality , " @entity13 said			2
" i thought something might happen to keep it from becoming official today			0
" @entity4 is an example of triumph in foster care			1
" i 'm a living example of it , that i have been through it , " @entity4 said			2
" i just never stopped			0
it will all work out			0
" @entity2 's @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
