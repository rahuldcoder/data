-- the " @entity9 " and the majority of the @entity12 world appear to have divergent views on two things about the @entity4 civil war : the centrality of the conflict and what constitutes the " worst case scenario			1
" for the @entity9 , the prospect of @entity14 or other @entity16 militants prevailing is a nightmare			1
but for many @entity18 muslims , the nightmare is already here			1
two years ago , i cautioned that given @entity4 's religious , sectarian and ethnic cleavages , and the minority @entity26 regime 's preference for brutally suppressing the majority @entity18 population rather than placating it by accommodating its @entity32 - inspired demands for reform , the turmoil there could morph into a protracted war pitting a ruthless dictator against an armed insurrection that could be usurped by @entity16 militants			1
that scenario come to fruition -- but that 's not all			0
the war in @entity4 has divided the @entity42 world , inflamed sectarianism across the @entity12 world , revived @entity14 and even turned into a juncture where the @entity9 and the @entity12 world went in seemingly opposite directions			1
unless the international community recognizes the repercussions of this conflict and makes ending it its top priority , these fissures will continue to deepen , leaving many relationships in tatters and the international institutions mandated to maintain peace looking ineffectual			0
faced with such a grim reality , the wide spectrum of players involved in the conflict will continue to resort to violence and to view the conflict through a zero - sum framework that will only add to the suffering of the beleaguered people of @entity4			2
more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict , which has turned millions more into refugees			0
@entity66 's forces have had the temerity to capture their atrocities on camera , and these hours of gut - wrenching footage have proved a treasure - trove for @entity14 and other @entity16 militants			1
they have capitalized on @entity66 's brutality to construct a @entity76 narrative that , unlike other places where @entity16 militants had tried to establish a foothold , has resonated with many @entity18 around the world			1
the onslaught against the @entity18 majority turned @entity4 into the favorite destination of militant @entity12 worldwide			1
it has provided @entity14 , which boasts not one but two affiliates there -- the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) and the @entity86 -- an opportunity to rebrand itself and given its recruitment efforts a shot in the arm			2
while estimates vary , analysts agree that thousands of @entity18 from places as varied as @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , and even the @entity101 have traveled to join the fighting in @entity4 , and the inflow is continuing			2
other individuals have donated thousands of dollars to support the armed opposition which , by all accounts , is slowly becoming dominated by @entity12 of varying degrees of militancy			0
as the secular @entity109 ( @entity109 ) continues to be plagued by internal divisions , it is the @entity12 who are taking the fight to @entity66			2
some , especially the @entity14 affiliates , have even attacked the @entity109 and driven them out of areas they fought long and hard to control			0
while regional players like @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity99 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 appear to be treating the conflict as a defining moment in the history of the region that could determine its political trajectory for years , the @entity9 , with the @entity101 at its helm , seems to be losing interest			0
even more worrisome for many in the @entity130 , recent reports in the @entity101 media suggest @entity101 officials are increasingly viewing the prospect of @entity16 militants displacing @entity66 or controlling large swathes of @entity4 territory as a " nightmarish " outcome			1
continuing carnage but for many of the roughly 1.3 billion @entity18 around the world , especially the majority @entity18 -- estimated to be around 85 % -- exactly who ousts @entity66 is immaterial			1
if it is the @entity12 , or even the terrorists of @entity14 , then so be it			0
to them , the nightmare is what 's happening now ; practically nothing could be worse			0
last week , 72 prominent @entity99 clerics issued a statement calling on @entity18 around the world to support a recently formed @entity16 coalition in @entity4 known as the " @entity151			2
" the good news is that the front does not include the two @entity14 affiliates , and the clerics did not call on @entity18 to travel to @entity4			1
however , the characterization of the conflict as a " @entity158 , " or holy war , is a troubling development , given that the @entity99 government prohibited its @entity162 from delivering politically - charged sermons and that its highest religious authority issued an edict enjoining @entity99 not to go to @entity4 , and that doing so would contravene the religious sanctions of @entity158			0
while it 's not surprising that the war is proving irresistible to hardened militants who have fought in @entity118 , @entity171 and elsewhere , it is disconcerting that it is also attracting recent converts to @entity12 from the @entity9 , underage boys who are traveling without their families ' knowledge and even some women : the case of a @entity99 woman who announced her triumphant arrival in @entity4 on @entity181 last week sheds light on the powerful gravitation force of @entity4 amongst the religiously devout			2
but it is not only the devout or the militant who are heeding the call			0
in one video , a militant @entity99 who joined the fighting in @entity4 holds back tears as he proudly boasts that he has encountered " mujahideen " there who confided in him that they did not know how to pray			0
in the minds of some @entity18 around the world , the trepidation that the @entity9 is voicing over the prospect of @entity14 or other militant islamists coming to power in @entity4 and the implications of such a scenario for religious and ethnic minorities is read as tacit acquiescence to what they see as a " genocide " -- a term the usually - reserved @entity99 foreign minister has been using lately -- against their @entity18 brethren			1
to them , the @entity9 is saying " better the @entity18 than the minority @entity213 , @entity26 , shia and @entity216			0
" this perception has already led to a serious rift between @entity99 -- the leader of the @entity18 world -- and the @entity101 in a strongly - worded statement explaining why it was declining a coveted two - year seat on the @entity224 @entity223 a few weeks ago , @entity99 cited the continuing carnage in @entity4 as one of the main reasons why it felt the international body was not fulfilling its mandate			1
it also accused the world of standing " idly " by			0
these two divergent assessments must be reconciled			0
the truth is that @entity66 and @entity14 are two ugly faces of the same coin			1
the sooner the international community realizes that , the sooner the only viable option becomes clear : both of them have to go			0

@entity252 or other militants prevailing in @entity4 is a nightmare for west
but @entity250 says for many @entity18 muslims , the nightmare is already here
attacks on @entity18 majority have turned @entity4 into favorite destination for militants : @entity250
@entity66 and @entity14 are two ugly faces of same coin , he says -- both must go
