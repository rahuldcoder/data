-- i do n't know if i 've watched too many scary movies lately , but i 've been pondering natural burial alternatives for dearly departed pets			1
i know eco-sensitive burial methods are increasingly popular with humans , but i was n't sure about pets , so i checked it out			1
ecologically sensitive burial methods have risen in popularity as of late , thanks much in part to the shaky economic climate			1
for budget - conscious families and green - minded mourners alike , cremation has emerged as an especially attractive alternative to old - fashioned burials that cost an arm and leg and are extremely resource intensive -- those resources being toxic embalming chemicals like formaldehyde , and concrete , steel and timber			1
then , of course , there 's the land itself and the copious amount of water and landscaping chemicals needed to keep the carefully manicured plot where your great @entity35 is interred looking its best			0
although cremation , in the end , is greener than traditional $ 4,000 metal casket - in - the - ground burials , it is n't without environmental minuses , specifically in terms of energy use and emissions			2
when it comes to sending a pet off into the great beyond , the options -- and their eco-drawbacks -- are similar : burial in a pet cemetery -- or zoological necropolis , if you will -- or more commonly , cremation			2
there 's also the bury - in - the - yard option , although you may want to check in with any local ordinances that may prohibit this if you plan on interring anything larger than a hamster , canary or goldfish			1
@entity0 : former @entity65 wins fight to adopt retired bomb - sniffing dog if you go this route , you should also probably not plan on moving anytime in the near future			2
and then there 's freeze - dried taxidermy for those who really ca n't stand the thought of parting with their furry companion			2
there is a natural pet burial movement , although it 's a relatively small one			0
founded in 2010 by @entity77 , the @entity78 is a nonprofit organization that offers " support for a gentle return " and seems to be the go - to resource for those curious about pet burials where eco-friendly / biodegradable containers , shrouds and unadorned pine boxes placed in natural settings are favored over plastic boxes and immaculately landscaped pet cemeteries			0
the @entity78 works in cooperation with the @entity91 in certifying eco-friendly pet cemeteries and maintains a list of participating providers including green cemeteries like @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , and the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 , that allow pet remains to be buried in family plots			0
some pet cemeteries , such as @entity106 's @entity105 , offer " @entity107 , " a process that uses alkaline hydrolysis instead of fire and boasts a dramatically reduced carbon footprint : it cuts natural gas usage by 90 % , electricity usage by 66 % , and co2 emissions by 90 %			1
so there you have it -- the small but growing green pet burial movement			0
not to be a @entity120 , but if you have the chance , i 'd also check out this story about pet estate planning ( yes , estate planning ... there 's quite a few wealthy animal heirs out there ) and grieving			0
in the meantime , enjoy frolicking with your pets while you can			0
