@entity0 -- it 's an audition without end , because the @entity4 still ca n't figure out how to cast the lead role			1
here 's how the internal discussion goes : we need someone who is a true conservative			0
we need someone who is right on the matters we care about -- the deficit , immigration , cultural issues			0
we need someone we can trust , who wo n't betray us			0
and , by the way , we also need someone who can win			0
and so @entity4 , undecided and unwilling to settle , continue to move like hummingbirds , from , um , flower to flower			1
yesterday , it was @entity23			1
today , it 's @entity25			1
maybe one day , @entity26			1
sure , this is all about the deep and abiding reluctance within the @entity4 to " settle " for @entity26			1
after the last two years of conservative ascendancy , why go with a candidate who seems more pragmatist than true believer ? why risk nominating another version of @entity35 , who turned on conservatives and raised taxes ? no way , they say			1
all of which has inspired an obvious @entity4 conflict between the head and the heart : in their brains , @entity4 know they ought to be looking for the most conservative @entity4 who has a good chance of getting elected			1
in their hearts , they are driven by anger at president @entity49 , and they 're looking for someone who can make the @entity4 case -- without compromise			1
simply put , the heartfelt question is the 2012 version of " @entity55 , on the wall , who 's the most conservative of them all ? " it 's the answer that 's complicated			0
first , it does n't help that the @entity61 @entity4 field is incredibly weak			1
start with @entity62 , who self - destructed when she claimed an hpv vaccine could cause mental retardation			1
then to @entity65 , who could n't remember his own plan to cut government			1
then to @entity23 who , well , has personal issues			2
then to @entity76 , who now seems to be the pick of the @entity61 litter , dazzling audiences with his professorial instant recall of the @entity73 and his obvious willingness to launch a frontal assault on @entity49			0
ah , but it 's @entity25			2
and any historian knows that @entity25 has a long personal history of self - destruction			1
he became famous as the architect of the @entity4 revolution in 1994 that made him @entity87 speaker ; then infamous as a lead critic of @entity90 's presidential affair while @entity76 was privately involved in one of his own			2
he 's the man calling for civil , @entity93 style debates ; he 's also the man who has called @entity49 " the most successful food stamp president " in @entity96 history			0
and then there 's the fact that @entity76 , a leader of one @entity4 revolution almost two decades ago , has n't had much to do with the current one			2
he famously went on tv and called rep. @entity104 's budget -- the @entity105 for most @entity106 -- " right - wing social engineering			0
" if he seems oddly out of touch with the @entity4 rank and file , that 's probably because he is			2
and even if the candidates were n't so problematic , the @entity4 itself is having some identity issues			2
the tea partiers , who were so important and popular in the 2010 midterm elections , are fast losing their luster			0
recent polls show the tea party lost support nationwide -- as well as in the strong tea party districts			0
according to a new @entity126 poll , in the 60 districts now held by tea party members , the @entity4 is viewed just as negatively as the @entity127			2
so @entity4 , who have spent so much time pandering to the tea party on issues , may now have to readjust			0
the tea party may have energized a lot of @entity4 , but it may also have traumatized others -- especially those looking for a winner in 2012			1
which brings us back to @entity26			0
he 's getting a tad testy these days about the long audition , telling @entity136 on @entity137 that he 's not a " lifelong politician " like @entity76			1
and he 's not for " amnesty " like @entity25			0
and that , of course , he has the " best shot " of replacing @entity49 if he is the @entity4 nominee			0
he 's got his lines down pat. now @entity4 need to figure out what kind of character they want to play the lead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

@entity150 : @entity4 want a very conservative candidate , but one who can win
she says @entity62 , @entity65 , @entity23 all have *flamed* out as conservative *standard* - *bearers*
now @entity25 is the *favorite* , but he has a lot of *baggage* , she says
@entity150 : @entity26 is showing signs of *irritation* at the long audition
