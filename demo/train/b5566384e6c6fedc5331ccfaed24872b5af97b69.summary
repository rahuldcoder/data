@entity0 , @entity1 -- sitting at the kitchen table in his small house , @entity3 has trouble even with a very simple question			0
he can not tell you the day of the week or the month , and he has to have the help of a calendar to tell you the year			0
" once a moment is gone , it 's gone , " said his brother and caregiver , @entity11 says in an interview to air on tonight 's " @entity17 "			1
" he ca n't remember any good times , birthday parties , @entity20 , any event			0
" on october 7 , 2006 , @entity3 , by his own admission , was drunk and disorderly			0
he refused an order from a police officer in his hometown to get off a city bus			0
the officer used his @entity27 ( officially , an " @entity28 " ) three times			0
according to doctors , @entity3 suffered immediate cardiac arrest			1
he was revived by emergency medical technicians who happened to be close by , but his attorneys say his brain was deprived of oxygen for as long as 18 minutes			1
he is now permanently disabled			0
@entity3 and his family have filed a lawsuit -- not against the police , but against the maker of the weapon , @entity41			1
@entity42 , a lawyer based in @entity43 , @entity1 , says he can prove that when the weapons are fired directly over the chest , they can cause and have caused cardiac arrest			1
in addition , @entity42 says he can prove @entity49 knew about that danger			2
" well , we can prove that by early 2006 , " said @entity42 , " but we suspect they had all the necessary data since 2005 , since they were funding the study			0
" the study @entity42 mentions was published in early 2006 by the @entity56			0
funded by @entity49 , it focused on pigs struck by @entity49 , with the conclusions , according to the study , " generalized to humans			1
" the authors wrote that being hit by a @entity49 is unlikely to cause cardiac arrest , but nevertheless recommended @entity49 darts not be fired near the heart to " greatly reduce any concern for induction of ventricular arrhythmias			1
" dr. @entity68 , a cardiologist based outside @entity69 , @entity70 , plans to testify against @entity49 in any lawsuit regarding what happened to @entity3			2
in plain @entity74 , he says , that recommendation is a clear warning			0
" i think @entity49 has been disingenuous and certainly up to 2006 -- the case we are talking about -- @entity49 said in their educational materials that there was no cardiac risk whatsoever , " @entity68 said			1
" that taser could not produce a heart problem , that there was no long lasting effect from @entity49			1
" medical experts say that if a person is hit by a taser dart near the chest , one result is a dramatic increase in the subject 's heartbeat -- from a resting 72 beats a minute to as many as 220 beats a minute for a short period of time			2
in its court filings , the company says the " peak - loaded " voltage from a taser at impact ranges up to 40,000 volts but it 's a 600 - volt average for the duration of the firing			1
in an e-mail , a spokesman for @entity49 said the company would not comment on any ongoing litigation			2
but in a court filing seeking to dismiss the @entity111 lawsuit , it said taser devices " are repeatedly proven safe through testing , in human volunteers , in controlled , medically approved studies			2
" there 's no evidence , the company says , that being hit with a @entity49 causes cardiac arrest in humans			1
but the company has significantly changed its recommendations for how @entity49 should be used			2
officers , it said , should no longer aim for the chest when using the device , instead targeting the arms , legs , buttocks			0
why the change ? a company document said " the answer has less to do with safety and more to do with effective risk management for law enforcement agencies			2
" in other words , say lawyers who have sued @entity49 , it means police are less likely to be sued if they avoid hitting subjects in the chest			1
in court papers , @entity49 says the risk of cardiac arrest is " extremely rare and would be rounded to near zero , " but it adds : " however , law enforcement is left defending a lawsuit and disproving a negative , which is difficult to do			1
" " out of one side of their mouth , they publish this warning , saying , ' do n't hit people in the chest if you can avoid it , ' " said @entity148 , an attorney representing @entity3			0
" and on the other side , in the lawsuit and in their public statements , they deny that their device can affect the human heart			2
" nearly every big - city police department in the @entity165 uses a taser device			2
according to the company , more than 14,000 law enforcement agencies worldwide employ tasers and more than 1.8 million people have had the weapon used on them since it was introduced into general law enforcement use in the 1990s			0
the human rights organization @entity173 estimates more than 400 people have died as a result of @entity49 strikes			1
officially , it 's not a gun			0
as an electronic control device , tasers are not classified as a firearm			0
the devices are regulated by the @entity183			0
" there 's one thing that 's undeniable -- that if i use my firearm , the chances are that you will suffer extreme injuries or death , " said @entity184 , the newly installed police chief in @entity185 , @entity1			0
" the chances are much greater of reducing injuries with a @entity49			2
" @entity185 is one of three big - city police departments in the @entity165 that do n't use @entity49 ( the others are @entity198 , @entity199 , and @entity200 )			1
@entity184 wants to change that			0
he supports use of the device but says to call it " nonlethal " is inaccurate			0
" we have referred to the @entity49 for many years as a less - lethal weapon , " he said			1
" in the @entity185 experience , which we have to concentrate on , i have not said once that this is a nonlethal device because i believe it can be a contributing factor in causing death			0
its latest earnings report says the firm made more than $ 100 million in profits last year by selling @entity49 to both law enforcement and to individual consumers			2
and the company says even more police and sheriff 's departments are lining up to purchase the weapon every day			0
the company argues in @entity3 's case that simply being in a stressful situation with police can bring on heart problems , and there 's no link between being being hit with a taser and the cardiac arrest			1
for @entity3 , greeting the mailman now is a highlight of his day			0
he does n't dispute that he was drunk and disorderly when the officer tried to get him off the bus , but he and his family blame @entity49 for what happened to him			2
he says he 's not frustrated or angry , just resigned to spending the rest of his life trying to remember what happened			0
after @entity2 first reported this story , @entity41 , which had previously declined all comment , sent us what it called a " fact sheet " about the @entity3 case			1
the company said the 2006 @entity49 study @entity2 quoted produced no cardiac arrests in animals			1
while the company says cardiac arrests in people are rare , @entity49 insists it does not claim a " zero " possibility of cardiac arrest			1
@entity49 also claimed @entity3 had a pre-existing heart condition and that his blood alcohol level made him vulnerable to cardiac arrest			1
@entity111 's medical and legal teams told @entity2 he had no documented heart problems. , and alcohol levels played no role in his cardiac arrest .			1

man claims @entity49 brought on cardiac arrest that *starved* his brain of oxygen
lawyers say taser - funded *research* shows heart risk from taser strikes
@entity41 insists no link between taser and cardiac arrest
