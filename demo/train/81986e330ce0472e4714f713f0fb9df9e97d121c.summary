@entity0 -- for more than a year , @entity2 slept on the streets , where she was the target of theft , violence and cruelty			1
her situation left her neglecting chronic health problems that threatened her survival			0
" it was so difficult to access [ medical ] services			1
i was totally alienated and i just could n't relate , " @entity2 said			2
" i would get things stolen from me			0
and ... two young women tried to set me on fire			1
life was just this movie and i was n't going to bother participating anymore			2
" then @entity2 stumbled upon someone she could relate to : dr. @entity19			1
since 1999 , @entity19 and her team have set up clinics inside @entity0 shelters to offer direct , free medical care to thousands of homeless women and children			1
" the women come into the shelters to get warm , to eat , to feel safe			1
and we 're already there , " said @entity19 , 58			1
there 's no registration or charge for the care			2
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity36 " the women learn to trust us as ambassadors of the health care system			1
and over time , we can teach them how to use [ it ] as it was intended , " she said			0
@entity19 gave up a more lucrative medical career to work with @entity0 's homeless population			1
as a medical resident pursuing cardiology in 1982 , she spent three months providing care in a @entity50 refugee camp and found a different calling			1
" they had lost everything			0
and i was able to make a difference just by traveling 10,000 miles out of my comfort zone ... and lending a hand , some medicines , and talking to them and treating their wounds , " @entity54 said			0
" that made a huge impression on me			0
" she became a primary care physician and found she could make a difference with @entity0 's homeless population in a similar way			1
" what i had to give them , more than anything , was just showing up , to listen and offer my services , " she said			2
@entity19 started her nonprofit -- women of @entity54 -- after working for seven years with the city 's established homeless health care programs			1
she found that , despite all of the quality medical resources for the homeless population , few women were actually using the services			1
female victims of domestic violence are often reluctant to use identification that could reveal their whereabouts , and vulnerable women often avoid clinic waiting rooms where they might encounter hostile members of the homeless community , @entity19 said			1
" for women who are poor , homeless or battered , to deal with a system of health care becomes overwhelming , " she said			1
" there are lots of emotional issues , psychiatric issues ... i just did n't like the idea that they were falling through the cracks			2
" @entity100 : why homeless women have it worse than men women of @entity54 works in 10 women 's shelters and offers help to more than 2,000 homeless women counted in the city 's latest census			1
the group consists of a part - time staff of nine nurses and 17 volunteer doctors representing all areas of care			1
teams work out of old broom closets and stairwells , addressing health issues ranging from colds to life - threatening cancers and gunshot wounds			0
the first challenge the group often faces in caring for the women is trust			2
" [ they ] do n't trust anyone			2
it 's a side product of being homeless , of having to look over your shoulder , watch your back			2
so that makes it very difficult for them to approach life normally , " she said			0
for this reason , the group handles first encounters as vital steppingstones in building a relationship			0
because they are not billing for services , staff are able to give whatever amount of time is needed to earn the clients ' trust , ultimately helping them open up and engage in their own health			1
" this is not just about a checkup or doling out antibiotics for an infection , but it 's about giving these women the acceptance -- and love -- they deserve , " @entity54 said			2
" it 's a process			0
it takes a long time			0
but we do n't put any time limits on it ' cause we know that in some cases , it 's literally life - saving			2
" the group functions entirely off grants and private and corporate donations			0
the physician and nurse teams work in the same shelter locations for at least one year , though most extend well beyond their initial commitment			0
the doctors together donate $ 500,000 in services annually , and everyone covers their own insurance and benefits			1
women of @entity19 has had a waiting list of volunteer physicians for years because the group 's current doctors " do n't ever leave , " said @entity19			1
" we have people who have been here for nine years ... because doctors just want to be doctors			0
there 's no managed - care rules			0
we love taking care of these women			1
and frankly it 's because that 's all we do			0
it 's just health care , " @entity19 said			1
@entity2 has benefited from the group 's approach			0
when she met @entity19 three years ago , she had a cataract that had gotten so bad , she said , that doctors were n't sure she had any sight in the eye			1
with @entity54 ' help , @entity2 had surgery to correct it			0
" dr. @entity19 talked to my social worker and they literally held my hand and took me to the hospital , " @entity2 said			1
" i just took the leap because dr. @entity19 was there			1
" today , @entity2 's newfound sight has lifted her depression and helped her take fewer medications			0
recently , she secured a bed at a residential shelter and said she aspires to start a paralegal service from her next apartment			0
@entity2 credits her improved vitality to @entity19			2
" because i knew she really cared , i started wanting to take care of myself , " she said			0
for @entity54 , that 's what her program is all about			0
" i love these women no matter what			0
that eventually starts to get taken inside -- that if i matter to somebody else , maybe i matter to myself , " she said			0
" we give women who are poor , homeless or battered the means to move ahead in their lives			2
... this is what feeds my soul and i will do this until i 'm no longer needed			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity238 website at @entity239 and see how to help .			0
