it now appears likely that @entity2 , the police officer in @entity3 , @entity4 , who shot and killed @entity5 , will never face criminal charges for his actions			1
the state grand jury declined to vote an indictment in november , and news reports indicate that there will be no federal charges against him either			2
whether these decisions are correct or not , they underline the difficulty of using criminal prosecutions as vehicles for large - scale reform			0
criminal investigations are based on close analysis of what happened at a particular time and place			0
@entity5 's death at @entity2 's hands is a classic example			1
at one level , the events of august 9 in @entity3 are undisputed			0
@entity5 robbed a convenience store			0
moments later , he and @entity2 had a confrontation at the window of @entity2 's patrol car -- during which @entity2 's gun fired			1
@entity5 , who was unarmed , walked away			0
@entity2 pursued him and shot him dead			1
outside of those facts , however , the details remain murky to this day			0
who was the aggressor ? what happened in the confrontation at the patrol car ? did @entity5 do anything to justify @entity2 's decision to fire the fatal shots ? appropriately , these questions have been at the heart of the state and federal investigations			1
but these detailed questions about what happened between @entity5 and @entity2 tell us little about the larger issues raised by the confrontation in @entity3			1
what 's it like for african - americans who interact with the police ? how do white police officers behave in largely minority communities ? how can african - americans receive dignified , equal treatment from the police -- and how can the police do their jobs in ways that keep themselves and their communities safe ? how can better training of officers , more diversity in police forces and community policing make our communities safer ? it 's understandable to try to use cases such as those of @entity5 and @entity77 as metaphors for the larger issues we face as a society			1
we understand the world in stories , in narratives , and we use those stories to justify how we see the broader world			0
it 's easier to try to figure out the nature of a confrontation between one civilian and one police officer than to parse the statistics that describe larger patterns of behavior			2
but these are two fundamentally different undertakings			0
determining the distance between @entity2 and @entity5 when the fatal shots were fired is a critical step in determining whether @entity2 is guilty of a crime			2
but determining that distance will tell us very little about race relations in the @entity101			0
symbols are important , but it 's dangerous to think that symbolic criminal prosecutions are ever appropriate			2
the criminal law functions best when it is closely tethered to the facts of an individual case			2
like defendants should always be treated in the same way ; once a society starts singling out certain individuals as " symbols " of larger problems , that automatically distorts the system			2
@entity2 deserves no worse ( and no better ) than to be treated like everyone else despite the symbolic importance his case has taken on			1
the same , of course , is true for the @entity121 police officers who caused the death of @entity77 , in @entity123 , on july 17			0
the failure to file criminal charges against @entity2 , of course , should not be seen as a vindication of @entity2 , the @entity3 police force or police officers generally			1
we live in a society where there are supposed to be substantial barriers to successful criminal prosecutions , like the highest standard of proof -- beyond a reasonable doubt			0
as a society , we care deeply , as we should , that innocent people are never convicted			0
but one individual 's liberation should not be taken to mean that the whole society is free from scrutiny , or censure			1
there is much more work to do , regardless of what happens to @entity2 , or any other individual .			1

@entity149 : @entity2 should be treated like everyone else despite case 's symbolism
but failure to file charges should **n't** be seen as vindication of @entity2 or police , he says
one individual 's liberation should **n't** be taken to mean society is free from scrutiny , he says
