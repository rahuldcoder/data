-- with the grandiloquence befitting such an occasion , @entity1 , the @entity2 biologist , television personality and " president for life " of the @entity6 , made the long - anticipated announcement thursday night			1
" the votes have been counted and verified , " said @entity1			1
" the mascot for the @entity6 is ... the blobfish ! " gallery : @entity14 's most hideous creatures @entity1 presented a certificate authenticating the choice of blobfish as the organization 's mascot to @entity20 , the @entity2 comedian who had championed the gelatinous fish as the society 's new mascot			1
according to the @entity32 @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , blobfish " look like a big , blobby tadpole , just a mass of pale , jelly - like flesh with puffy , loose skin , a big nose and beady , staring eyes			2
" they 're not very big either , growing only to about 12 inches in length			0
@entity31 says nobody has ever seen them eat , but the @entity36 says they feast on crabs and lobsters			0
blobfish are found mainly off the coast of southeastern @entity41 and @entity42			0
like many of the world 's ugliest fish , they prefer to lay low , usually at depths of 2,000 to 4,000 feet ( 600 to 1,200 meters ) , bobbing around above the bottom of the ocean			0
which is a shame , really			0
this cross between the cartoon character @entity53 and an anemic lump of jelly deserves to be seen by the masses			0
the @entity6 is dedicated " to raising the profile of some of @entity60 's more aesthetically challenged children			2
" led by @entity1 , the group of like - minded comedians spent the summer fishing around for public nominations as part of its pursuit to name the world 's ugliest animal			1
with the help of the @entity70 , @entity1 put together a @entity72 page on which ugly animal fans could watch 11 comedians plead their cases for 11 ugly but endangered animals			2
in the end , the blobfish and its champion , @entity20 , came out on top			0
other contenders included the proboscis monkey , a primate with an obscene schnoz ; the flightless dung beetle ; and the unfortunate pig - nosed turtle			1
see the video with @entity1 and @entity88 on the @entity6 website .			1

@entity91 named official mascot of @entity6
proboscis monkey , pig - nosed turtle mount challenge , but no ugliness could equal the blob
@entity6 is *brainchild* of @entity1 , @entity2 biologist and television personality
