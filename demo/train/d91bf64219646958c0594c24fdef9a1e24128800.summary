-- @entity1 , anger and shock greeted official statements from @entity6 authorities that texts and social media posts from survivors trapped inside the stricken ferry had been faked			1
messages such as " i am still alive ... in the cafeteria please help me my battery is running out please believe me , " and " my phone is not working i am inside the boat i ca n't see anything " were spreading on social media on thursday -- as late as over 24 hours after the incident			1
the messages gave extra substance to hope at least some of the hundreds of missing passengers were alive and awaiting rescue			2
news and rumors of the texts circulated around families of the missing			2
the purported texts contained so much detail , they made relatives " surprised and excited , " one mother said earlier this week			2
the texts also fueled a tense atmosphere at @entity35 -- where distraught families viewed them as proof several passengers were alive			2
this led to remonstrations and the hurling of objects at authorities , who relatives accused of not doing enough to save their children			0
" an investigation from the @entity52 verified that all texts in question [ from passengers still within the ship ] are fake , " @entity6 police posted on its official @entity50 account			1
" please stop such actions that are causing pain to the families of missing passengers			0
the malicious distributors of these texts will be strictly dealt with			0
" @entity6 has been gripped by this tragedy and the pronouncement of these fake social posts added to the collective anguish -- especially as social media has been playing a crucial role in relaying information from the site			1
police successfully put out a call on social media to find any relatives of a rescued six - year - old girl who had been on board with her parents and older brother			1
the revelations of fake posts have added to a growing sense of public confusion , mistrust and escalating frustration -- particularly among the passengers ' relatives -- over the handling of the search and rescue operations , media coverage and official releases of information			1
@entity92 grief across the country , scheduled festivals , concerts and school field trips are among the events that have been canceled			0
tv networks have been carrying the search virtually non-stop since the incident			0
all news and top searched keywords on the main internet portals remain linked to the ship , while wishes for good news are flooding social media			1
" hoping everyone will be returned to the arms of their families ... please be strong			0
remembering the @entity116 disaster ... " tweeted @entity114 pitcher @entity113			0
" all i can hope for is that our friends will return alive ... " tweeted @entity117 , a senior at the high school that sent 325 students and 15 teachers on a field trip aboard the ill - fated ferry			1
