@entity0 and @entity1 will no longer allow visitors with disabilities instant access to rides , starting next month , in an attempt to reduce abuse of the policy			1
under the current policy , @entity9 visitors can get a guest assistance card that grants quicker access to rides , often entering through exit doors to bypass the main lines			1
there were widespread reports of able - bodied people abusing the policy			1
some wealthy park visitors were hiring disabled people to pretend to be family members so they could skip lines , the @entity19 reported in may			2
@entity25 researcher wednesday @entity24 learned about the practice while researching a book about @entity30 's @entity29 elite , the @entity19 reported			2
" it really is happening , " @entity24 told @entity33 's " @entity32 " in may			2
starting october 9 , guests with a new disability access card will be issued a ticket with a time to enter an attraction , based on the current wait time , so they do n't have to stay in line			1
@entity9 fan site @entity40 broke the news of the policy change last week			1
@entity1 vows action after report of wealthy hiring disabled to skip lines no proof of disability is required under either the current or new policies			2
asked why @entity9 could n't keep the current system and require disabled guests to provide proof of disability , @entity9 spokeswoman @entity50 said , " due to confidentiality laws , we 're limited in the information we can ask			1
" " we have an unwavering commitment to making our parks accessible to all guests , " @entity50 said in a statement			0
" given the increasing volume of requests we receive for special access to our attractions , we are changing our process to create a more consistent experience for all our guests while providing accommodations for guests with disabilities			2
we engaged disability groups , such as @entity71 , to develop this new process , which is in line with the rest of our industry			2
" @entity50 stressed that the program is different from the parks ' @entity78 program , which issues a limited number of fastpasses per hour for certain attractions			0
a guest using the new disability card would get a return time based on the actual wait time for the ride			0
@entity88 , whose 4 - year - old son has spina bifida , agreed that there needed to be a change to stop the abuse			0
but she worried that the new system makes things more complicated for families that really need help			0
to @entity9 , or not to @entity9 ? " for example , my son , similar to many others living with disabilities , has special medical procedures that have to be done at a specific frequency throughout the day , " @entity88 , of @entity99 , @entity100 , wrote in an e-mail			1
" to then have to worry about ' scheduling ' rides is just one more complication to add to a visit that is probably already more complex than most people realize			1
" @entity9 , which is starting to train its employees on the new policy this week , will release more details of the program closer to the october 9 rollout date , @entity50 said			1
guests who still have concerns about the policy can talk to guest relations about their assistance needs , she added			0
annual passholder @entity122 of @entity124 , @entity125 , says the policy change may cause her to drop her annual pass and reduce her seven to 10 annual trips to @entity0			0
@entity122 , who has complex regional pain syndrome , can walk but experiences " excruciating pain " from the lightest of touches or when she stands or sits in one position for too long			0
" it makes it a challenge to be able to go and enjoy the park , " she said			0
" i will need to figure out how to structure my visits differently and become more aware of my pain			0
this is unfortunate , as one of the things @entity0 has given me is that escape			0
" @entity144 , whose family is heading to @entity0 for the first time in december , is willing to give @entity9 the benefit of the doubt during the rollout			1
" @entity9 has an admirable history of accommodating guests with special needs , " she wrote on her " @entity153 " blog about kids with special needs			1
" there are wheelchairs and @entity161 available for rent , special dietary offerings at most restaurants , designated relief areas for service animals , plus options for guests with hearing and visual impairment			0
i ca n't imagine that @entity9 would ever leave kids with special needs in the ( pixie ) dust			1
" parents of kids with special needs sure are n't shy about speaking up when something is n't working			0
if the realities of the new program prove too hard to handle , the parks will hear about it -- and hopefully make adjustments accordingly			0
" what do you think of @entity9 's new program ? please share in the comments section below .			1

able - bodied people were reportedly using @entity9 's disability policy
@entity9 ca n't require that people prove their disability
the new policy wo n't allow almost immediate access to the rides
