-- a pair of north @entity3 delegates addressed the @entity4 for the first time saturday , each representing a new government formed after revolution and civil war ousted their respective long - time leaders			0
from @entity11 , the executive chairman of the country 's transitional council formally addressed the assembly 's 66th annual session , saying his country was ready to " redevelop itself " and " heal its wounds			1
" @entity20 also called for a thaw of @entity11 financial assets , frozen during the ongoing conflict between pro and @entity26 forces			1
col. @entity27 -- who ruled @entity11 with near absolute power for more than four decades -- fled from office last month , although pockets of resistance have remained			2
@entity20 's speech was in stark contrast to a rambling 90 - minute address given by the former @entity11 leader two years ago in which he criticized the @entity39 and the composition of its security council			1
from @entity44 , foreign minister @entity43 also addressed the assembly -- the first time an @entity44 delegate has done so representing a post- @entity48 government			2
long - time strongman and former @entity44 president @entity48 stepped down in february , handing over power to the military and ending three decades of iron - clad rule following an 18 - day popular revolution			0
in a move that seemed to punctuate recent tensions between @entity44 and @entity58 ( rioters stormed the @entity58 embassy in @entity61 earlier this month ) the country 's foreign minister told delegates that @entity44 is supportive of a @entity64 @entity39 bid for statehood			1
he added that the quartet -- representatives from the @entity68 , the @entity39 , @entity69 and the @entity70 -- had failed " to come up with a balanced vision			1
" the first week of @entity39 debates wrapped up on saturday as delegates outlined their visions for peace and global security			0
but one topic remained at the forefront of the annual session : the bid for @entity64 statehood			1
on friday , @entity64 president @entity82 put forth a historic request for full @entity39 membership , a move @entity58 says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns			1
the measure prompted the quartet to issue a call for renewed talks , after they broke down last year			0
their statement friday outlined a timetable for an @entity58 - @entity64 peace agreement to be reached before the end of 2012 , countering any anticipation of immediate change in the region			2
@entity82 told reporters traveling with him saturday that he would not comment on the quartet statement before studying it , according to @entity104 , the @entity105 news agency			1
but he added that any proposal that did not include an end to settlement activities and a return to the 1967 borders would not be dealt with			0
he said there were many last - minute meetings on the sidelines of the @entity4 , with diplomats seeking to persuade him to give up his request for @entity64 statehood			2
" all these meeting , which were confusing , did not make us change our position because our goal was to deliver the official and humanitarian @entity64 message , " @entity82 said			1
@entity82 ' application -- viewed as a largely symbolic gesture because an @entity68 veto is all but assured should it come to a vote in the @entity128 -- drew applause in the assembly when the @entity64 leader raised the document at the podium			1
" peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the @entity39 , " @entity68 president @entity134 said in a speech to delegates at the @entity4 earlier this week			0
" if it were that easy , it would have been accomplished by now			0
" the @entity68 president said he supports @entity64 statehood , but reiterated a long - standing @entity68 position that @entity58 must be part of the discussions			2
@entity58 has described the bid as counterproductive , and has called for an immediate resumption of talks to begin in @entity150 and to be continued in @entity151 and @entity152			0
the @entity128 is expected to meet monday to further discuss the issue			1
also saturday , the international body hosted a mini-summit on drought and famine in the @entity158			0
@entity39 @entity159 ban ki - moon said more than 13 million people in @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 " need our help			0
" he said three - quarters of a million people are " at imminent risk of starvation " as a result of war , rising food costs and droughts that have continually plagued the region			0
the mini-summit coincided with a @entity177 decision in @entity178 to boost aid to the region to $ 1.88 billion from more than $ 500 million , the @entity178 - based financial institution announced saturday .			0
