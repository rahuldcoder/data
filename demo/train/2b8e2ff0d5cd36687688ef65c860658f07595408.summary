your co-workers will bolt from work early today			0
bars will make a killing			0
and even the most indifferent of your friends will feign a slight interest in the @entity8			0
for today , the @entity9 begins its @entity11 adventure when it goes toe - to - toe with its nemesis , @entity14			1
the @entity14 have knocked the @entity9 out of competition the last two go - rounds -- in 2006 and 2010			1
can the @entity9 avoid a three - peat ? it 'd better , if it wants to see its @entity8 ambitions stay alive			1
because after @entity14 , the @entity9 takes on two giants : @entity20 and @entity21 -- ranked by @entity22 as the second - and fourth - best teams in the world			1
for its part , the @entity9 is ranked 13th			1
no wonder @entity26 -- the one the @entity9 finds itself in -- has been nicknamed the " @entity27			1
" why focus on the negative though ? sure , @entity30 's odds of lifting the most coveted soccer trophy in the world are 100 to 1			2
but the 23 players on the squad have dreamed of playing on the grandest stage of soccer since they were kids			2
@entity37 , 32 , was one of them			0
as a child , he 'd leave notes for his mom , signed , " @entity42 # 15			0
" now , he signs autographs that way			0
" for one month every four years , the world stops , everybody is watching , " said team captain @entity46			2
" to have the opportunity to represent our country , to wear our colors , there 's nothing else like it			2
" why you should worry @entity14 has n't been kind to @entity30 's @entity8 soccer aspirations			1
it knocked out the @entity9 from the group stage in 2006 with a 2 - 1 win			1
in 2010 , the @entity9 gave them a run for the money			1
but alas , an extra-time goal from @entity14 -- in the 93rd minute -- sent the @entity9 packing once again , 2 - 1			1
seven players from the 2010 @entity67 team are back monday , including the lightning - fast @entity68 , the team captain			1
and the @entity9 will have to be ready for anything			1
why you should n't worry in the warm - up matches ahead of the tournament , the @entity9 won all three of its games -- against @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity14 lost two of its three -- to @entity79 and the @entity80			1
( it beat fellow @entity8 participant @entity81 handily			0
) second , none of the @entity9 players is hobbled by injury			1
one of @entity14 's best , @entity87 , is			1
he 'll start the match against the @entity9 on the bench as will @entity90 , who scored against the @entity9 in 2010			1
finally , it 's very , very wet and rainy in @entity92 , where the game will be played			2
" when there 's rain in a soccer game , it means that it 's pretty much an equalizer a lot of the time , " says @entity95 correspondent @entity94			2
" who to watch @entity14 's @entity105 brothers			1
there are two of them : @entity109 and @entity110			0
they 're fast and they 're a threat -- especially @entity105 , who has worked his way into the starting lineup against the @entity9			1
when @entity14 beat @entity81 in the warm - up , he scored all the goals but one in the 4 - 0 wipeout			1
this , after coming in as a substitute ! on the @entity9 side , hopes are riding high on 26 - year - old @entity46 , the best @entity9 midfielder of his generation			2
he 's creative and attack - minded			2
look for him to come up with some dazzling plays			0
then there 's goalie @entity127			2
he 's one of the best in the world			2
oh , and he scores too -- the way he did for @entity132 in a @entity134 match against @entity135			0
who wo n't be there @entity138 , the all - time top @entity9 goal scorer ( 57 )			1
for fans , coach @entity140 's decision to leave him out does n't add up			0
@entity140 said other players were " a tiny little bit ahead of him , " and though he did n't want to go into details , he alluded to the 32 - year - old @entity138 not having the speed and ankle - breaking one - on - one skills he once possessed			1
what should you ignore @entity140 , a tough - talking @entity20 who won a @entity8 himself , took over from @entity151 as the @entity9 coach in 2011			2
all his work has been building up to this moment			0
so fans were n't too pleased when they heard him say this : " for us now talking about winning a @entity8 , it 's just not realistic			0
first we 've got to make it through the group			0
so let 's keep our feet on the ground and say , let 's get that group first done , and then the sky is the limit			0
" there 's another way to look at it			0
maybe he 's managing expectations			0
after all , @entity140 himself struck a more optimistic note sunday			0
" we wan na go far , that 's definitely our goal , " he said			0
" i booked my flight after the final			0
" who will win depends on the counterattacks			0
the @entity14 players are fast and nimble			1
the @entity9 are creative at seizing opportunities			2
so it 'll come down to whichever team can disrupt possession and run with it			0
our guess ? it 'll be a 1 - 1 draw			0
