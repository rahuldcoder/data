it 's been a big week for makeovers in the world of aviation			1
first , @entity6 carrier @entity5 unveiled its new branding , which included a complete overhaul of its livery			1
the old " canyon blue " was retired for a darker shade , the stripes on the tail have been modified , the fonts brought into the 21st century , and -- most significantly -- a yellow , red and blue heart added to the plane 's belly			1
" the heart emblazoned on our aircraft , and within our new look , symbolizes our commitment that we 'll remain true to our core values as we set our sights on the future , " explained @entity19 , @entity5 ' ceo , in a statement			1
a few days later , @entity29 similarly announced a redesign , this one a homage to the carrier 's original incarnation ( the first @entity29 closed down in 1986 )			1
in its newest form , @entity29 borrowed design elements from the original livery , including the stylized , @entity37 - designed f in the brand name			0
both carriers are experiencing a shift in their corporate identity ; @entity5 should be finalizing its takeover of @entity43 , while @entity29 recently rebranded as an ultra low - cost carrier			1
" it 's common for airlines to shake off their image with a new livery , " explains @entity45 , an airline brand specialist and founder of thedesignair.net			1
" when @entity54 merged with @entity55 , they created a new livery to show they were one entity			0
" livery delivery while usually , according to @entity45 , airline liveries have a shelf life of 20 years or so , there 's been a recent spate of aircraft redesigns			1
@entity6 , @entity63 , @entity64 are just a few of the carriers to tweak their appearance of late , and rumors abound that @entity70 airline @entity69 will soon undergo a major facelift as well			1
" in the last couple of years , there 's been an influx of new aircraft into a lot of fleets : 777s and @entity78			2
a lot of airlines have taken advantage of this opportunity to create a point of differentiation , " explains @entity45			1
@entity6 and @entity86 brands , he notes , tend to follow a similar aesthetic , known as " @entity88 "			2
it 's a concept known for its simplicity , and usually comes down to an airline putting an emblem on the tail of an aircraft , and their logo on the fuselage			2
" a lot of carriers do it			0
it comes down to cost , " explains @entity45			0
" if you have an airplane in a hanger for 12 days , that 's 12 days that aircraft is out of service			2
especially for larger carriers with 100 aircraft in their fleet , the simpler the design , the less money they 're loosing			0
" the @entity115 effect there are a handful of airlines , however , that have taken a different tact			2
several carriers in the @entity115 have also made over their liveries , favoring intricate designs that highlight the local design culture			1
when @entity126 rebranded itself earlier this year , for example , it took inspiration from @entity129 art , and borrowed several traditional motifs , particularly the @entity132 symbol on the tail			0
when @entity135 introduced its regional subsidy , ' @entity135 , it similarly opted for a local aesthetic when crafting the new livery this year			0
the carrier teamed up with father - and - son design team @entity140 and @entity141 to craft a look that honored the local culture			1
the duo came up with livery that is simultaneously based on @entity135 ' inter-island route map , and traditional @entity135 crafts			0
" the ' @entity135 brand is deeply rooted in the communities of our islands , and it was important for the design to reflect that sense of family and community , " explains @entity148 , @entity135 ' senior vice president of marketing			0
@entity148 admits that the planes have a more complicated paint job -- each aircraft takes 14 days to complete			0
going viral ? finally , liveries can be a great marketing exercise for an airline			1
during the @entity167 , for example , several airlines introduced special edition liveries			2
to mark @entity172 's 40th birthday , @entity170 's @entity169 introduced the @entity173 to more locations around the world			0
few airlines have mastered liveries ' marketing potential like @entity64 , however , who for years has partnered with the @entity181 franchise , creating @entity183 - themed safety videos , and emblazoning their aircraft with a new decal for each film that hits the theaters			1
last year , one of their planes sported a decal of @entity192 -- the fire - breathing dragon from the latest @entity195 movie			0
" their partnership with @entity181 created this huge viral following , " says @entity45			0
" it was a relatively small carrier , but now everyone 's heard of them			2
