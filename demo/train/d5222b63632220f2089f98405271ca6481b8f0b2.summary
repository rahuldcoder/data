-- in a place accustomed to tough stretches , this has been a particularly tough few days at the @entity4			1
after emerging from the showdown over the @entity9 - led government shutdown relatively unscathed , the @entity6 administration finds itself under assault on three fronts : problems surrounding @entity15 , the revelations of the @entity17 spying on allies , and the 2012 attack on the @entity17 diplomatic compound in @entity21 , @entity22 , the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the @entity6 administration 's nominations			1
the controversies are sure to fuel continued @entity9 attacks on president @entity6 and his @entity28 allies as the nation gears up for midterm elections next year , and the @entity4 has portrayed the attacks as so much partisan chatter			1
but to @entity0 senior political analyst @entity34 , they reflect the relative inexperience of the @entity6 @entity4			1
" this is an administration that has been very , very good at its politics , but has never been very good at execution of policies from @entity42 , " he said monday			1
" it 's an administration which has some really smart people in it , and a lot of younger people			1
it does n't have very many heavyweights			2
" the worst part for @entity6 may be figuring out what to do about it all -- not just the various individual fires , but more generally how to " take control of his own government , " @entity0 chief political analyst @entity52 said			2
if you 're the president , how do you make sure that subordinates are n't withholding information you should know ? how do you strike the right balance , and explain it clearly , on things such as gathering intelligence versus maximizing privacy and protecting key relationships ? and how do you make sure those tied to your administration avoid big missteps that could come back to bite you ? " four out of five @entity17 have little or no trust in their government to do anything right , " @entity52 writes in an analysis			1
" and now @entity6 probably feels the same way			2
" does @entity6 still have faith in government ? here are the latest details on the issues causing the administration the most heartache today : @entity15 another week , another congressional hearing on the problem - plagued rollout of @entity6 's health insurance program			1
this time , @entity82 , head of the @entity83 -- which is in charge of the @entity15 website -- became the first administration official to formally apologize to @entity17 for the troublesome start			1
she offered the apology tuesday in an appearance before the @entity91			0
" we know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage , and to the millions of @entity17 who have attempted to use @entity97 to shop and enroll in health care coverage , i want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should , " she told lawmakers			1
obamacare website administrator apologizes the website , which would - be applicants have found difficult to use , at best , embarrassingly crashed over the weekend , leaving consumers completely locked out			0
then , the @entity4 found itself on the defensive over revelations that , despite claims to the contrary by the @entity6 administration , some who have purchased insurance on the open market will lose their coverage and have to buy new policies			1
an insurance industry source told @entity0 monday that the vast majority of @entity17 who have purchased coverage on the individual market will find their policies changed or even canceled under @entity15 rules			2
it 's been known for some time that some of the policies would have to change -- the @entity123 said in 2010 as part of a federal regulation that up to two thirds of individual policies would n't meet regulations allowing them to continue under what 's called " grandfathered " status			0
that refers to plans allowed to continue even though they do n't provide all the rights and protections of those offered under @entity15			0
@entity4 spokesman @entity136 argued monday the administration has always said some health care plans would not meet new @entity15 requirements			1
" there are existing health care plans on the individual market that do n't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the @entity15 , " he said			2
" there are some that can be grandfathered if people want to keep insurance that 's substandard			0
" and those who lose coverage will be able to buy more comprehensive coverage on the health insurance exchanges -- some of them at a subsidized price , he said			1
but the reality that so many plans will disappear or have to change seems to fly in the face of what @entity6 said so often in selling the plan to voters			0
" if you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan , " the president said in 2009 , and frequently since			2
it also offered @entity9 ammunition to renew their attacks on the plan			0
" the larger problem is how @entity15 is hurting people out there , " senate minority leader @entity171 said tuesday			0
" it is about college graduates and middle - class families getting hit with massive premium increases they ca n't afford			0
" @entity180 spying after months of seemingly endless leaks about @entity17 surveillance programs , the pressure on the administration rose to new levels in recent days with revelations published by the @entity188 news magazine @entity187 that the @entity17 was collecting the communications of allied leaders , including @entity188 chancellor @entity191			1
@entity15 and @entity180 spying : what did @entity6 know , and when did he find out ? @entity188 leaders respond angrily to the news , with @entity191 demanding a stop to the practice and proclaiming that her country 's confidence in the @entity17 had been " shaken			2
" but it was comments by the administration claiming that @entity6 did not know of the practice until recently that drew the sharpest criticism -- from both the right and the left			1
rep. @entity208 , the @entity9 chairman of the @entity209 , was incredulous that the president did n't know what was going on			0
" he certainly should have known , if he did n't , " the former chairman of the @entity213 told @entity0 's @entity214 on " @entity215			0
" " i think that 's almost more of a serious issue that something like that at that level would be conducted without him knowing it			0
" rep. @entity208 on @entity180 spying : if @entity6 did n't know , he should have and sen. @entity225 , @entity226 , said not knowing about the program was a " big problem " for both @entity6 and the @entity229 , which she chairs			2
" as far as i 'm concerned , @entity231 needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing , " her statement said			0
" to that end , the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs			0
" @entity21 longstanding @entity9 criticism of the administration 's handling of the attack on the @entity17 diplomatic compound in @entity21 , which left the @entity17 ambassador to @entity22 and three other @entity17 dead , resurfaced this week with sen. @entity245 , @entity247 - @entity246 , threatening to hold up administration nominations over the issue			1
senators are expected soon to review @entity6 's nominations for several high - profile judicial appointments and other nominations			2
@entity229 rules allow a single senator to at least temporarily hold up presidential nominations , and @entity245 says he will do so until the administration makes survivors of the attack available for congressional testimony			1
" i 'm going to block every appointment in the @entity229 until the survivors are being made available to @entity231 , " he said			0
" i 'm tired of hearing from people on tv and reading about stuff in books			0
we need to get to the bottom of this			0
" the @entity4 said monday that @entity245 and other republicans are using @entity21 for political purposes , " and we find that unfortunate			1
" @entity0 's @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity4 is on the defensive over claims some could lose health coverage
the administration is also facing criticism over spying *allegations*
@entity21 is also resurfacing as senator threatens to delay nominations
the controversies are sure to fuel partisan rancor as midterm campaigns ramp up
