-- over the centuries , people have had some very good reasons to dress up like a member of the opposite sex			1
after record - setting @entity8 athlete @entity7 died in 1980 , it was revealed that she had indeed been a man			1
and i 'm not talking about people who live this way out of personal preference , or those who dress up for theater and entertainment			2
here are just five examples			2
cross-dressing to join the army until recently , women have rarely been allowed to serve as soldiers			1
so what was a gal to do if she wanted to serve her country ? naturally , disguise herself as a man and join the troops			2
at least 400 @entity29 soldiers were women in drag			1
these included @entity32 soldier " @entity31 " ( also known as @entity33 ) , whose small frame and feminine mannerisms ( rather than causing suspicion ) made her an ideal spy , as she could spy on the @entity37 disguised as ... a woman ! she was n't the first woman to don a male disguise and join the army , though			1
during the @entity44 , women fought as men on both sides			1
@entity48 , for example , joined the @entity50 army to find her husband , who had walked out on her to enlist			1
once her true sex was discovered ( thanks to a pesky groin injury ) , she became a national celebrity in @entity50 , and made a post-war career of performing in bars as the " @entity58			2
" @entity0 : the @entity60 's plan to conquer @entity61 2			2
cross-dressing to keep a royal family together with all the power play that went on in the court , the @entity64 royal family would go to great lengths to avoid sibling rivalry			1
in one of the more extreme cases , @entity69 , @entity70 ( 1640 - 1701 ) , was raised as a girl to discourage him from any political or military aspirations			2
this would make things easier for his brother , the future @entity77			2
@entity69 wore dresses and make - up , enjoyed traditionally feminine pursuits , and was even encouraged towards homosexuality			2
a girly man he might have been , but he married twice and even had a mistress			2
when necessary , he could even lead an army into battle			2
( this is the nation , after all , that gave us that famous cross-dresser @entity90			2
) a brave commander , he would go into battle wearing high heels , plenty of jewelry and a long , perfumed wig			0
one of his wives claimed that @entity69 's biggest fear when going into battle was not bullets , but the possibility of looking a mess			0
he avoided gunpowder ( with the black smoke stains ) and did n't wear a hat , to avoid ruining his hair			0
@entity0 : 11 weird & wonderful wedding rings 3			0
cross-dressing to win @entity8 glory dressing in drag has been part of the @entity8 ( on and off ) since ancient times , when women were banned from the bulk of the @entity114			1
the @entity116 historian @entity115 said that if a spectator was uncovered as a woman in male disguise , she was duly escorted off the premises ... and thrown off a cliff			1
in later games , the athletes started performing naked , and the crowd was also ordered to disrobe			0
it has been suggested that this was to ensure that they were all men			1
in the modern olympics , there has been less disrobing -- and not much cross-dressing , either			0
gender tests have been normal procedure since 1966 ( for athletes , not spectators ) , so they could n't really get away with it			0
before that time , one of the strangest -- and most controversial -- cases was @entity139 sprinter @entity7 ( aka @entity7 ) , who set 11 world records in her career , winning the 100 - meter @entity8 finals in 1932 with what one official described as " long man - like strides			1
" after she died in 1980 , however , it was revealed that she had indeed been a man			0
so had he deliberately set out to fool everyone all that time ? perhaps not			0
@entity7 had a condition known as " mosaicism , " which gave her male chromosomes			0
did they give her an unfair advantage ? it is difficult to say			0
however , if she tried out for the @entity8 today , she would not be allowed to compete as a woman			1
@entity0 : 13 medal - worthy @entity8 stories 4			1
cross-dressing to commit espionage there have been many instances of cross-dressing spies ( including @entity33 , mentioned above ) , but one of the most impressive deceptions in history was carried out by @entity168 , a singer with the @entity170 ( in which , traditionally , all roles are played by men )			1
in 1964 he disguised himself as a woman to seduce @entity176 , an attache in the @entity64 foreign service			1
their affair lasted 20 years ( on and off ) , during which @entity176 passed several official documents to @entity183 , believing that " her " safety was at risk if he did n't participate			0
after they were separated in 1965 , @entity183 came back into @entity176 's life by claiming to be pregnant , and even revealed a baby boy			0
they later lived as a family			0
the happy couple was eventually arrested for espionage in 1983 , and @entity183 's secret was revealed , @entity196 style , to the stunned @entity176			0
but how did they have this romance for so long without @entity199 knowing the truth ? officially , they rarely made love , and always did it hurriedly and in darkness -- something that @entity176 always ascribed to @entity183 's demure @entity206 upbringing			0
one theory , however , is that he always knew the truth , but played dumb to conceal his homosexuality			0
( he later came out			0
) the affair was the basis for the play " @entity214			0
" it was filmed in 1993 , starring @entity216 and former @entity170 player @entity217 ( better known for the title role in the film " @entity219 " )			0
cross-dressing to get rowdy @entity221 women in @entity222 have traditionally lived inhibited lives , tending the home for their families			1
but on one night each year , in the city of @entity227 , they come to life at the so - called " @entity229			1
" dressed as noblemen , complete with turbans and large fake mustaches , they walk the streets in gangs , brandishing sticks , beating any males who are foolish enough to be out there			0
the festival celebrates an ancient domestic dispute between the @entity241 and his wife @entity242			0
while the women sing devotional songs asking the goddess to return to her husband , they also take this as their only opportunity to do what they long to do all year : behave like men			1
their husbands , respecting the tradition , let them go wild			1
it sounds like fun ( as long as you 're not a clueless male who forgot to stay at home that night ) , but one thing concerns me : if a woman 's disguise is especially good , does she risk being mistaken for a man and beaten up by her friends ? for more mental_floss articles , visit @entity267 entire contents of this article copyright , @entity269 rights reserved .			1
