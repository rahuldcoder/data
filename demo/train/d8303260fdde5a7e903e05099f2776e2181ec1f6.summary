-- the next time you see a motorist obliviously straddling two lanes , do n't fault bad driving , but genetics			1
in a study published recently in the journal @entity9 , researcher @entity6 found that people with a certain gene variant performed more than 30 percent worse on a driving test than people without it			1
the study by @entity6 , a neurology professor at the @entity16 , might also help explain why there are so many bad drivers on @entity20 highways : about 30 percent of @entity20 have the variant			1
ordinarily , when a person performs a task , a protein called brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( @entity26 ) is secreted to the area of the brain that is associated with that activity			0
the protein helps facilitate communication among brain cells and helps retain memory			0
however in people who have the gene variation that @entity6 studied , @entity26 secretion is limited			1
" these people make more errors from the get - go , and they forget more of what they learned after time away , " @entity6 said in a statement			2
@entity6 and his team of researchers set out to find how the variant affected driving			2
they recruited 29 people to drive 15 laps on a simulated course with difficult curves and turns			0
twenty - two of the participants did not have the gene variant ; seven did			1
the researchers wanted to see how effectively the participants learned to navigate the twists and turns in each subsequent lap. four days later , they repeated the test			0
the participants with the variant did worse both times			2
they also retained less the second go - round			0
" i 'd be curious to know the genetics of people who get into car crashes , " @entity6 said			0
" i wonder if the accident rate is higher for drivers with the variant			0
" unfortunately , a test to determine whether someone has the gene variant is not commercially available .			1

study finds bad driving may have genetic basis
people with certain gene variant performed worse on driving test that those without it
nearly 30 percent of @entity20 have variant , according to study
