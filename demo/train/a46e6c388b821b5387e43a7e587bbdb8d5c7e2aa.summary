-- the top dogs ruled the world 's most famous hot dog eating contest , once again			1
@entity4 is always a big event , drawing thousands to @entity7 's @entity6 to cheer on some of the world 's most accomplished competitive eaters			1
but this year 's edition proved extra special for historical , dramatic and sentimental reasons			0
the @entity16 , @entity17 , resident was no stranger to the @entity6 contest before he won his seventh hot dog - eating title thursday			2
that 's cumulative and consecutive , as he 's won each of these events since 2007			0
but it 's how he did it this time -- topping his own record by gobbling 69 frankfurters and buns in 10 minutes -- that proved one for the record books			1
his 69 downed dogs is the most by anyone since the competition began in 1916 , and one ahead of the 68 mark he 'd set last july 4 as well as in 2009			0
" sixty - nine is the magic number , " @entity14 told @entity37 , which broadcast the event			0
" came out here , the crowd pushed me , they would not let me slow down			0
and it 's awesome " while there was no doubt @entity14 would win after he pulled away to top his nearest foe by 19 hot dogs , the same could n't be said for the women 's event			1
every bite counted as @entity53 " @entity55 " @entity52 and @entity54 dueled down to the wire			0
when the clock ran out , the scoreboard had it as a tie -- 36 hot dogs apiece			1
but the judges tipped the scales in @entity52 ' favor , ruling that the @entity66 , @entity67 , resident had gorged on 36ยพ hot dogs			1
that was ยพ more than @entity70 , enough to give @entity52 her third title despite the fact her final tally was far below the 45 hot dogs she put away last @entity77			2
still , @entity52 and @entity14 's championships were significant as much for where they took place , as for what they did			0
parts of @entity6 , on @entity7 's southern coast some 12 miles south of @entity84 , were ravaged eight months ago when @entity85 rolled through			1
scores of businesses and backdrops that tens of thousands associate with summer fun suffered major damage there and in other places , like the @entity95			0
yet the hum of amusement park rides and the buzz of the throngs packing to cheer on @entity14 , @entity52 and others on thursday is proof that , for one day at least , @entity6 is back .			2

@entity14 wins 7th @entity4 in @entity6
his 69 hot dogs and buns consumed breaks the event 's previous record
@entity109 ekes out another win in the women 's competition
the event was a *celebration* of @entity6 , which was hit hard by @entity85
