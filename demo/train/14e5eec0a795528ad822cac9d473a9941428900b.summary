@entity0 -- the @entity4 administration misused intelligence to build a case for the @entity8 - led invasion of @entity9 in 2003 , the @entity2 said in a report issued thursday			1
president @entity4 did n't request intelligence reports about the post-war situation , the @entity2 panel 's report says			1
the @entity15 exploited its ability to declassify intelligence selectively to bolster its case for war , the committee chairman , sen. @entity19 , @entity21 , said in the report			1
senior officials disclosed and discussed sensitive intelligence reports that supported the administration 's policy objectives and kept out of public discourse information that did not , he said			2
the report also found that the administration misled the @entity8 people about contacts between @entity33			1
" policymakers ' statements did not accurately convey the intelligence assessments " about contacts between the then - @entity9 leader and @entity41 's group , " and left the impression that the contacts led to substantive @entity9 cooperation or support of @entity46 , " the report said			1
" statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that @entity9 and @entity46 had a partnership , or that @entity9 had provided @entity46 with weapons training , were not substantiated by the intelligence , " according to the committee 's exhaustive report on prewar intelligence			1
the top @entity57 on the committee dismissed its findings as " partisan gamesmanship			0
" " it is ironic that the @entity64 would knowingly distort and misrepresent the committee 's findings and the intelligence in an effort to prove that the administration distorted and mischaracterized the intelligence , " said sen. @entity61 of @entity62			2
the @entity15 also rejected the report as old news			1
" i know this is another report , and i 'm sure that they put a lot of considerable thought into it , but this is a subject that has been gone over many many , many times , and i do n't know of anything that 's particularly new in it , " said spokeswoman @entity71 , who said she had not yet read it			0
she said the @entity15 relied on the same information as the rest of the world , admitting that it was wrong but denying that @entity4 had set out to mislead the country			1
@entity15 claims that @entity33 was seeking weapons of mass destruction were partially backed by available intelligence , the report found , but did not reflect disputes within the intelligence community			1
the @entity95 , among others , believed @entity9 was trying to acquire nuclear weapons , but the @entity97 disagreed , the report said			2
no weapons of mass destruction were found in @entity9 after the invasion			0
the report also took the administration to task for its predictions about the aftermath of the invasion , including vice president @entity107 's assertion that @entity8 troops would be greeted as liberators			0
@entity4 and @entity107 did not request intelligence reports about the post-war situation , and their public statements did not reflect doubts and uncertainties in the intelligence community , the report said			1
the report comes days after former @entity15 press spokesman @entity118 published a book saying @entity4 decided on war with @entity9 soon after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" @entity4 and his advisers knew that the @entity8 people would almost certainly not support a war launched primarily for the ambitious purpose of transforming the @entity126			0
rather than open this @entity129 , the administration chose a different path -- not employing out - and - out deception , but shading the truth , " @entity118 wrote in his memoir , " what happened			0
" current and former @entity15 officials have dismissed @entity118 's accusations , saying he was not in a position to know about top - level @entity15 decision - making before the war when he was deputy press secretary			2
the @entity2 committee chairman slammed the @entity15 in a statement marking the release of the long - awaited report			2
" before taking the country to war , this administration owed it to the @entity8 people to give them a 100 percent accurate picture of the threat we faced , " @entity19 said thursday			0
" unfortunately , our committee has concluded that the administration made significant claims that were not supported by the intelligence			0
in making the case for war , the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted or even nonexistent			2
as a result , the @entity8 people were led to believe that the threat from @entity9 was much greater than actually existed , " he added			0
the report picked apart three speeches by @entity4 , including his 2003 @entity165 address two months before the invasion , one by @entity107 and then - secretary of state @entity167 's @entity169 presentation about @entity9 in the run - up to the war			1
the report was approved by a 10 - 5 vote , with some republicans dissenting			0
some @entity57 members of the committee had wanted the report to examine prewar statements by @entity64 , including sen. @entity179			0
democrats on the committee blocked the suggestion and limited the report 's purview to administration statements only			0
@entity1 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
