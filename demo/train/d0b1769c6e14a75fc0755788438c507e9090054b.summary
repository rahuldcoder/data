-- driving a lorry or a truck across the country is n't easy			0
in the @entity5 , by law truckers have to take a break after 11 consecutive hours			0
in @entity8 , the maximum driving time is nine hours per day			0
but imagine a world where trucks drive through the night without ever stopping			1
there 's no need for a coffee break or a nap , and yet there are never any accidents			0
that 's because these trucks do n't actually have any drivers			1
the age of the driverless vehicle is upon us			2
some famous names have been developing and testing prototypes with the aim of making them commercially viable			2
@entity27 , a pioneer in the field , started its self - driving car project in 2009 and its autonomous vehicles completed 100,000 miles ( about 161,000 kilometers ) on public roads 18 months later			1
the @entity8 recently allowed the vehicles on the road , joining @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 in the @entity5 in changing the laws to accommodate the new technology			1
businesses stand to benefit in a multitude of ways , whether they are waiting for delivery of goods or for executives to arrive for meetings or conferences			2
smoother traffic flow will make journey times more predictable and scheduling simple			0
maintenance of a steady speed will reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions			0
and the " drivers " -- if vehicles have them -- may carry out other tasks while traveling and arrive fresher			2
and it 's not chump change			2
for example , in @entity62 , 76 % of total goods traffic in 2011 were transported by road , according to the @entity65			0
@entity66 , the @entity67 car giant , says that , despite @entity62 roads becoming over-congested as the highway network has hardly grown in recent years , goods traffic is set to increase substantially in the coming years			1
the company is developing the @entity72 with the promise that in a decade drivers of the vehicle will be " transport managers " rather than truck drivers			0
" we are facing completely new models for freight traffic , " said prof. @entity78 , director of the faculty of information management in mechanical engineering at @entity82 in @entity67			0
these new intelligent cars " are able to initiate and organize their collection , transport and delivery at their destination			0
they are thus able to react flexibly to spontaneous situations like traffic jams or increased cargo volumes by negotiating new delivery times with each other or customers			0
" under @entity66 's system , once driving at 80 kph ( around 50 mph ) on a highway , the driver will be prompted to activate the highway pilot that puts the truck in autonomous mode , leaving him or her free to pivot the seat 45 degrees			1
the driver will then have access to a center console " in the style of an office workstation " and will be able to use a removable tablet touchscreen computer for other tasks such as sending invoices or completing tax returns , according to @entity66			1
@entity117 successfully carried out its first public road test of the technology using its @entity121 electric vehicle on a highway southwest of @entity123 last november			1
@entity124 , the chief executive of @entity117 , said recently that innovations to ease congestion and emissions are badly needed due to the increasing number of " global mega-cities			1
" @entity117 is making progress on an autonomous car in both @entity132 and @entity133 , where the government recently authorized testing with a view to opening @entity133 roads to the vehicles by 2020			1
the @entity132 carmaker has been working with universities including @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
it says around 90 % of road accidents are currently caused by human error			0
under its system , drivers remain at the wheel but the vehicle can automatically steer , brake , accelerate , change lanes , merge into traffic and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles			1
" at the moment lorry drivers need to stop every four hours , " under @entity8 laws for rest breaks , said prof. @entity157 of the @entity159 's @entity158 , " but driverless trucks can go 24 hours a day			1
" driverless technology could help companies reliant on the roads in much the same way as unmanned drones like those tested by @entity170 and @entity27 's solar - powered @entity172 unit hold the promise to speed up deliveries by air			1
but there are some other considerable obstacles to overcome , including extensive legal issues			0
for example , does a driver have to be in a driverless car -- just in case ? an amendment to the @entity184 was agreed to allow a car to drive itself so long as the driver is present and able to take the wheel and the system " can be overridden or switched off by the driver , " according to the consultancy @entity190			2
a lack of standardized technology is a concern , as are issues of public and private responsibility			2
@entity8 's @entity197 review is currently inviting submissions up to september in order to establish regulatory , safety and social obstacles to the testing of self - driving cars on public roads -- and how they can be removed			2
such consultations may help to clear up the ethical conundrum of whether man or machine is responsible for accidents			0
and if the technology is to realize its full potential , large numbers of vehicles must be able to communicate with each other and with computers integrated into the roads			1
but there is mounting evidence to suggest that within a decade or so , it will be commonplace for the average person to drive past a heavy - goods lorry with no - one at the wheel - and be perfectly comfortable with that			0
market research company @entity222 reckons that by 2030 , more than 40 % of all vehicles in @entity62 are likely to be equipped with driverless car technology			1
quite what this means for the humble roadside truck stop remains to be seen			0
watch : driverless cars could let you sleep read more : @entity27 's new car : no driver , and no steering wheel watch : keeping up with the technology boom			1

vehicles being developed that can automatically steer , brake , accelerate , and change lanes
@entity27 , @entity66 and @entity117 are a few of the firms testing this technology
driverless trucks could aid businesses by running around the clock
