@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you do n't know @entity5 's claim to fame , you will in a hurry after you enter his small apartment in this gritty @entity9 on the @entity10			1
maybe you 'll see the framed poster of the most famous boxer of all time in his office , the one autographed , " to @entity5 and @entity15 : good luck to my dear friends , from @entity19			1
after me , there will be no other			0
@entity21 stay off my foot ! " ( we 'll explain that in a minute )			0
or maybe he 'll hand you a business card for his job as a liquor salesman			0
flip it over , and you 'll find a photo of a young @entity5 , boxing trunks pulled over his navel , standing over a fallen @entity19 in the ring			1
or maybe he 'll sit down in his recliner and tell you one of his favorite stories , like the night he came back to his hotel room after he survived 15 rounds with @entity19 in a stunning 1975 fight			1
" the day before the ( @entity19 ) fight , i took my wife out shopping and bought her a powder - blue negligée , because i told her , ' you need to look right when you sleep with the heavyweight champion of the world , ' " he said			1
" the night i lost , my ( ex- ) wife is sitting on the edge of the bed in the negligée and she asks , ' so , am i going to @entity19 's room or what ? ' " but you do n't have to meet @entity5 to know why he 's famous -- and why he 's about to become even more well - known in the coming months			1
you 've seen the movies , all six of them , in the theaters or a few dozen times on cable tv			0
@entity57 played @entity58 in the famous film series			1
@entity5 is @entity58 , the man who went almost the full 15 rounds ( the fight was stopped in the 15th ) with @entity19 in 1975 to inspire the @entity64 - winning movie			1
but his real - life story is actually more fascinating , more layered and compelling , than the one that has raked in more than $ 1 billion			1
that 's why @entity69 is making a documentary about his life , and why @entity72 is making another movie about the man who inspired @entity58			1
but @entity5 is clear on one point			2
" this is not another @entity58 movie , " he said recently			2
" it 's a movie about the real @entity58			1
" the changing face of women 's boxing the real @entity58 is one of boxing 's true characters , a burly former @entity83 nicknamed the @entity84 who went from fighting in smoky @entity1 clubs to knocking down ( but not out ) the mighty @entity19			1
he 's also a man who spent three years in prison for cocaine possession but rebounded to find the love of his life			1
he has a story about the night he asked @entity15 , his wife , on a date			0
" i used to drink vodka all the time , but i remember that the beer cooler was on the other side of the bar and you had to bend over to get into it , " he said			0
" so she bent over and got one and i said , ' you wan na go out ! ' i picked her up after work that day			0
that 's a true story			2
" they 're all true stories			0
or , at least mostly true			0
again , with 72 - year - old @entity5 , it 's always best to let him explain			1
" there 's one scene in ( the movie ) , i 'm in a hotel room with a couple of my go - go girls , " he said			0
" i 'm pouring champagne all over their bodies and drinking the champagne			0
" i said ( to the writer ) , ' you got me laying in the bed with three go - go girls pouring champagne over them			0
it was only two ! ' and he said , ' @entity5 , three , four , five girls , people will believe anything about you ! ' " @entity127 is set to portray him in " @entity128 , " which is scheduled to hit theaters in 2012 , while @entity130 will play @entity15 and @entity131 will play his first wife			2
the project has been in the works for more than seven years , and @entity5 is convinced it can shock the world the way @entity57 's fictional version did 35 years ago			1
but first , sports fans will revisit @entity5 's career with an hourlong @entity69 documentary , set to air on october 25 , called " @entity58			1
" @entity141 , who has produced sports movies like " @entity143 " and documentaries like " @entity145 , " is producing both projects			0
" with @entity5 , " @entity141 said in a phone interview , " you have a guy who outside of certain parts of @entity1 can be treated almost like a fictional character , but you have this fascinating chapter of boxing lore and all these real - life characters to draw from			1
" none of this would have happened if @entity5 's mother did n't interrupt him during an episode of " @entity159 " in 1975 and tell him to pick up that day 's newspaper			1
promoter @entity161 had chosen @entity5 to fight @entity19 , but no one had bothered to tell him			1
@entity163 : @entity165 coach @entity164 it was supposed to be an easy fight for @entity19 , who had just stunned @entity168 in @entity169 to regain the heavyweight championship			1
@entity19 was 45 - 2 , at the peak of his fame			2
@entity5 ? he was no slouch , but not in the same league			2
@entity175 , the longtime boxing writer for the @entity176 , called it " a fight between a house painter and an artist			0
" but @entity5 spent seven weeks " laying off the booze and women , " he said , training for his moment			2
and it lasted more than a moment			0
on march 24 , 1975 , @entity5 went 15 rounds with @entity19 , briefly knocking him to the canvas in the ninth round			1
( @entity5 insists he hit the champ with a shot just below his heart ; @entity19 has long contended that his opponent stepped on his foot			1
) watch @entity5 knock down @entity19 the fight made him famous , but the movies changed his life			1
@entity57 was watching in @entity198 , and two years later , @entity5 was sitting in a @entity200 theater thinking , " i hope this movie 's decent			1
" " it was amazing ! " @entity5 said			2
" i had no idea			0
after the knockdown of @entity207 , the crowd started jeering him and started cheering for me			0
people are coming up to me and hugging me , ' @entity210 ! great movie ! ' " but the movie is only one twist in @entity5 's life			1
he retired from boxing and wrestled " @entity217 " at @entity218 , the massive pro wrestler spun him in the air before tossing him out of the ring			0
watch @entity5 fight " @entity217 " " you know what it was ? the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , it was all parties , " @entity5 said			2
" everywhere you went there was cocaine			0
i 've got to be honest with you , it was a great , great time in my life , other than getting in trouble			2
i managed to get through that and everything is great now			0
it was one party after another			0
i used to be out from thursday to sunday			0
it was so much fun			0
you might say the good times were very addictive			0
" the trouble : @entity5 was arrested in 1985 for cocaine possession			1
he spent nearly three years in prison , but he re-emerged clean and , with @entity15 , happy			2
plus , in 2006 scored his biggest victory outside the ring : he settled a lawsuit with @entity57 for using him as his inspiration for the @entity248			2
( details of the settlement have not been revealed			0
) now , he 'll have a documentary and a movie on his life and career , which is more fascinating than anything a screenwriter could dream up			2
but for the real @entity58 , this is no case of sudden fame			2
" @entity259 said to me , ' wow , you 're finally getting some recognition			0
" for 36 years , i 've been the champ			0
