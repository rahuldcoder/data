-- at 32 years old @entity1 is president of cancer - support charity the @entity3			1
he has also survived three separate cases of cancer			0
in august 1996 , @entity1 was a 19 - year - old college soccer player when a @entity7 scan revealed a shadow behind his heart			1
doctors said there was only a slim chance he had cancer , but he needed surgery			0
during the operation , @entity1 had an allergic reaction to the morphine he was being given as a painkiller , meaning he had to finish the surgery without any pain relief			2
he made it through the surgery , but two weeks later @entity1 was told he had chondrosarcoma -- a bone cancer that develops in cartilage			1
" doctors started talking about ' we need to go in and take out part of your spine , and you may never walk again ' -- things that were so drastic i could n't even comprehend , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" i went into a state of anger -- i just did n't know what to make of all of it			0
to have everything taken from you from a control perspective , to be a the mercy of others and to have to learn something you do n't know anything about was really scary			0
" supported by his parents , both of whom are themselves cancer survivors , @entity1 recovered fully from the chondrosarcoma , but a few months later a mole on his chest was diagnosed as melanoma			1
incredibly , three months later , @entity1 was told he had a second melanoma			2
" when you 're 19 , to have it [ cancer ] once is abnormal , but to go through this period between my 19th and 20th birthdays -- it 's just not normal , " he said " you 're supposed to be in college , you 're supposed to be out having fun			2
i 'm supposed to be playing soccer and doing things i love and this was just interrupting my life			0
it was changing the course that i had imagined and what everybody had hoped for			0
" @entity1 is now completely cancer free but knows he is at risk of having melanoma again			1
his physical recovery has been so complete that he has managed to run numerous marathons , including a 100 - mile run in the @entity75 , but he is careful to schedule his training runs early in the morning to protect himself from the sun. realizing there was a lack of support for young adults with cancer , @entity1 and his family founded the @entity85 fund for @entity86 , which provides education , support and resources to young adults with cancer and their families			1
the foundation caught the notice of seven - times @entity96 champion and cancer survivor @entity97 and he enlisted @entity98 to help run the @entity3			1
@entity0 's chief medical correspondent @entity99 is also a board member of the foundation			0
@entity1 says he now spends much of his time raising money and talking with cancer survivors and their families			1
" it 's incredibly beneficial to help other people , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" you help yourself and it also allows us to focus on other people 's experiences and try to help them as appose to dwelling on our own			0
" i 'm grateful for that , i 've learned so much from so many people who have such a spirit and resiliency -- it 's inspiring			0
