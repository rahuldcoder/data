the disaster that wrecked a luxury cruise liner and killed at least six passengers has left officials and experts on maritime navigation searching for answers -- fast			1
but two days after the massive ship hit rocks and rolled spectacularly on its side , answers were in short supply			1
why was the ship -- with 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- so close in to shore in an area where local sailors say the sea bed is pockmarked with rocks ? what happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground ? why was no " mayday " distress signal sent ? @entity22 issued a statement saying " preliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship 's master , captain @entity30			1
" " the route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore , and the captain 's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard @entity22 procedures , " the statement added @entity40 prosecutors announced plans to seize the ship 's data recorders , which some refer to as " black boxes			1
" authorities hope to complete an analysis revealing what happened within a few days			2
the ship hit rocks off the coast of @entity53 on friday , leaving 20 people injured in addition to those killed , authorities said			1
according to the @entity40 @entity58 , the @entity57 was simply too close inland			1
but what authorities , and the cruise line , ca n't answer is why			1
capt. @entity62 , spokesman for the @entity40 @entity58 , said authorities " know what the cause " was : " the water went on board			1
" " why he ( the captain ) went so close is why we are investigating , " @entity62 said			1
@entity71 , who is under arrest , denies the assertion that he had steered the ship too far inland			1
" we were about 300 meters ( 1,000 feet ) from the shore , more or less , " @entity71 said after the accident			0
there was a " lateral rock projection , " he said			0
" even though we were sailing along the coast with the tourist navigation system , i firmly believe that the rocks were not detected , as the ship was not heading forward but sideways , as if underwater there was this rock projection , " he said			1
but @entity62 insists " every danger in this area is on the nautical chart			0
this is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing			0
... all the dangers are known			0
" @entity71 is facing charges of manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship , while passengers were still on board , according to @entity40 's @entity102 news agency			1
but , according to @entity102 , @entity71 says he and his crew were " the last to abandon ship			2
" @entity22 is owned by @entity104			1
carnival issued a statement saturday saying it was " deeply saddened " by the " terrible tragedy			0
" " we are working to fully understand the cause of what occurred , " the statement said			0
carnival officials did not immediately return a call sunday from @entity113 requesting further comment regarding the wreck or the safety of its other cruise lines , such as @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			1
local authorities and residents told @entity113 they believe that after sustaining damage from what it struck , the ship sailed at least half a mile north , and the captain turned it around toward land , where it toppled			1
experts on cruise - ship safety say there is no way to know immediately what went wrong			1
" human error or navigational error is a real possibility , " said @entity135 , a cruise industry consultant and former navigating officer			1
" those are the two most likely causes " in general , he said , noting that a combination of the two could be to blame			2
but there are examples of cruise ships hitting uncharted rocks , he said			1
@entity148 , professor of naval architecture at the @entity149 , told @entity113 that @entity150 , where the @entity57 wreck took place , " is probably pretty well - charted			0
the @entity153 has been traveled for some thousand years			0
" " looking at the pictures of the damage , it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute , and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss.			2
. but just like when you 're driving an rv or something , when you swing the nose to the right , the tail swings little to the left			0
if you look at the photos of the ship , you can see that the rock embedded in the side of the ship 's left port side ... as if exactly that happened			2
she swung her tail over and kissed that rock			0
" cruise ships that travel on international voyages , include the @entity57 , are subject to the regulations of the @entity179 , a @entity180 agency			2
" passenger ships in operation today are subject to a vast array of regulations and standards covering every aspect of ship construction and operation , " the @entity179 website says			2
" a number of incidents over the years have led to improvements in safety requirements , " the site adds			2
@entity22 , in its statement sunday , said it " complies very strictly with all safety regulations and our personnel are committed , first and foremost , to guest safety and security			1
. " all crew members are trained in basic safety and emergency management , and their skills are tested periodically by @entity58 authorities , the statement said			1
survivors of the wreck , however , described crew members who appeared overwhelmed			0
" there was n't anybody to help you , " said passenger @entity211			0
" i mean , the passengers were loading the lifeboats by themselves			0
" the industry association representing cruise lines emphasized sunday that disasters are rare			1
" any given day in excess of 300,000 people are on board our ships , being safely carried to various locations throughout the world , " said @entity220 , executive vice president of the @entity221			0
in general , if something goes wrong and a ship starts to take on water , " you either take the ship back to a safe port , if it 's possible to do that , " @entity220 said , or " if the ship is in imminent danger there are procedures and protocols for abandoning ship			2
" the captain has to make a series of decisions , @entity220 said			2
he could leave the ship , if he delegates certain responsibilities , but the captain is in charge of the safety of the vessel and remains in charge until everyone on board is safe , @entity220 said			1
as for a mayday signal , @entity220 said the captain is required to report to authorities any " marine casualty , " a term that includes damage to the ship that can compromise its safety and ability to safely return to port			1
the captain " is a professional			2
he must at that point weigh the risks of taking one course of action vs. another , " @entity220 said			0
taking place 100 years after the @entity269 , this disaster is " remarkably similar , " @entity148 said			0
" @entity270 similarly grazed an object on her side			0
in her case , it was an iceberg , and in her case as the water came in , she tore multiple compartments open			0
. " the result of that accident in the engineering side was that we rewrote the ways that we design ships , and those bulkheads that separate the compartments run all the way up to the main deck of the ship			2
so , you ca n't get that cascading effect			0
and we design ships to withstand a certain number of those compartments being breached simultaneously			0
" @entity220 agreed that the damage to the @entity57 " appears similar to the damage of the @entity270			0
" but " this was a grounding , not an iceberg , " and " in a well - traveled area close to shore -- not in the middle of the ocean			0
" it 's too soon to know whether any new regulations are needed to avoid a disaster like this , said @entity220			0
but , he said , " if corrected measures are necessary , i can assure you that we , alongside the @entity40 authorities , will be suggesting those changes be made			1

@entity22 says preliminary indications suggest possible " significant human error "
the @entity40 @entity58 says the ship was too far inland
the captain says *undetected* rocks are to blame
the cruise industry association *highlights* an overall strong safety record
