-- @entity2 's re-emergence into global motorsport has gathered pace after @entity5 confirmed it will return to elite motorbike racing in 2015			1
@entity5 withdrew from @entity7 at the end of the 2011 season , blaming the global recession for its decision to leave the sport , but has had a rethink to partly help develop its range of bikes			1
" @entity5 has organized its test team to undergo more practical running tests at its advanced development stage and will participate in the official joint testing to be held at the @entity22 circuit in @entity23 , " said a @entity5 statement			2
" through continuing running tests at the circuits inside and outside @entity2 for further development and refinement , @entity5 will participate again in @entity7 racing from 2015			1
" @entity5 will feed back advanced technology to be derived through @entity7 racing activity to develop further attractive production models			0
" @entity2 's @entity32 and current @entity34 rider @entity33 were in the saddle as @entity5 made its return to the track during monday 's official test event at the @entity22			1
" i am satisfied because the first test at @entity45 was quite good and now we are at a @entity48 track , with most of the other riders and running in the same conditions , " @entity40 's @entity39 told the sport 's official website after monday 's first run			2
" i think we did a great job because i 'm only seven tenths slower than the best lap time today and after only 50 or 60 laps ; all of the other riders have already been here for three days			0
i am satisfied , but think we could be even faster if we had one more day			0
" anyway , it 's a good start because we now go to @entity58 for a two - day test , so i really hope to do the same job and have the same feeling with the bike			0
" @entity5 's return follows @entity65 's decision to make its @entity67 comeback by agreeing to supply engines to the @entity70 team from 2015 onwards			1
@entity5 boasts a two - wheel racing heritage which dates back to the 1970s , with @entity73 's @entity72 winning the 500c world championship in 1976			0
five further championships followed , with the last being won by @entity77 @entity76 in 2000 .			0
