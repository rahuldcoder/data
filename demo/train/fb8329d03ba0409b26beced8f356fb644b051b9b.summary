@entity0 , @entity1 -- three stats tell part of the story			2
the @entity6 -- one of the wealthiest nations on @entity9 -- has the second highest rate of childhood poverty in the rich world , according to @entity13			1
( only @entity15 fares worse			0
) about one in five @entity6 kids is poor , according to @entity18 data			1
( for a family of four , the poverty level is an income of no more than $ 23,834 )			2
and , as of 2011 , 3.55 million live on less than $ 2 a day , according to a paper from researchers at the @entity24 and @entity25			0
i 'm on the road this month , however , to try to understand the human cost of child poverty in the @entity6			1
i 'll be meeting with families who are struggling to make ends meet ; talking to kids about what it 's like to be poor in a rich country ; and looking at the long - term consequences of allowing so many of our children to grow up amid financial turmoil			2
you can follow the trip on my @entity42 and @entity43			1
importantly , i 'll also be searching for solutions			0
to that end , my first stop is @entity1 , where i landed this morning			0
( it 's 8:22 a.m. as i type this on a bus to @entity0 , the capital , and the sun is nowhere to be seen , thanks to the extreme northern latitude			0
) it 's famous for its unpronounceable volcanoes and @entity57 , but @entity1 also has one of the lowest child poverty rates in the world			1
i 'm here to learn about several pioneering programs that aim to help poor kids -- and see what ideas @entity6 could steal			1
i 'll also make a trip to @entity66 's @entity65 , home to @entity67 and @entity42 -- and also to striking rates of child poverty			1
one in three kids in the valley is at risk for hunger , according to @entity74 , spokeswoman for the @entity75 in @entity65			0
@entity77 - high rents -- more than $ 2,100 per month on average for a one - bedroom apartment -- make homelessness and food shortages shockingly common there , i 'm told			2
some 200 people are reported to live in an encampment for homeless people in @entity86 that everyone calls " @entity88			0
" apparently , poverty is everywhere in @entity6			1
and in some places it 's particularly extreme			0
in @entity96 , for example , another of my planned stops , the rate nears 60 %			2
child advocates and academics say we 've chosen to keep our poverty rate this high in the @entity6 by rejecting policies that would help our kids and families succeed			1
" there are a lot of things we can do for children that we 're not doing " in the @entity6 , said @entity104 , an associate professor of economics at @entity106			1
" we could dramatically reduce child poverty if we chose to , " @entity112 , a professor of applied psychology at @entity113 , who has studies solutions to child poverty , told me			1
i 'm inclined to believe them			0
i ca n't think child poverty -- with its nasty outcomes , like prison time , low educational achievement and poor health -- is inevitable			1
but i 'll be testing that hypothesis this month			0
i 'd invite you to follow that journey on social media , and if you do , please , please ask questions and challenge my assumptions			2
you can help guide my reporting -- and the outcome of this project			0
@entity2 readers , after all , voted for me to report on child poverty as part of my @entity135 project			1
this is the last of five issues you selected			0
thanks in advance for your contributions			0
i 'll report back soon .			0
