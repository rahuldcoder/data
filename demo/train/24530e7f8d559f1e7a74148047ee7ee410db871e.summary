-- i grew up a poor kid in @entity3			1
government cheese sandwiches , occasional nights without electricity , long - distance telephone calls reserved for emergencies only			2
yet despite our struggles , my family never lost hope that life would get better for us			0
we never lost faith in the @entity16 dream			0
and as trivial as it may seem , a lot of that had to do with @entity19			1
now before you dismiss the notion that a chain restaurant could somehow be a beacon of light , you have to understand that in my neighborhood , if your family went to @entity19 for dinner , that meant you were really doing something			1
it meant you got dressed up in your church clothes			0
it meant you would be using a salad fork and maybe even ordering the fancy dish you saw on tv			0
it meant twice , sometimes three times a year , a poor family like mine could order a steak in a middle - class restaurant and pretend we were rich			1
this is why when word recently came out that the chain was in financial trouble , i -- and many people who grew up poor like me -- paused			1
" our industry is in a period of significant change , with relatively low levels of consumer demand in each of the past several years for restaurants generally , and for casual dining in particular , " said @entity46 , the ceo of @entity47 , the parent company of @entity19 , @entity48 and @entity49 , among others			1
according to @entity58 , @entity47 reported a 37.6 % drop in earnings per share in the first quarter of the current fiscal year compared with a year before			2
@entity19 was the biggest culprit			1
the magazine reports that the restaurant 's revenue dropped 4.9 % during the second quarter			0
@entity47 this month announced plans to separate @entity19 's 705 locations from the rest of its portfolio with the possibility that it could be sold off			1
as i 've gotten older and a bit more affluent , perhaps even snobbier , i recognize that with the exception of those delicious cheddar biscuits , most of @entity19 's dishes pretty much taste the same			1
but statistics suggest that we have n't been going to restaurants like @entity19 the way we used to , and it 's not because our collective palate has changed			1
it 's because we ca n't afford to eat out anymore			1
in the four years since the economy began to rebound , the median annual household income fell by 4.4 %			0
but for black households like the one i grew up in , income fell by nearly 11 % , more than twice the rate of @entity93 homes and three times that of whites			2
@entity19 remains a favorite spot for black families to dine after church			1
i imagine it 's harder to do with over a 10th of the family 's income gone			0
but it 's a mistake to blame the erosion of buying power and the decline of middle - class touchstones like @entity19 or @entity108 on just the @entity109			1
the truth is , the working class has been getting pinched for decades			1
from november 2012 to november 2013 , weekly earnings rose 1.1 % while the consumer price index increased 1.2 % , according to the @entity114			0
that small uptick may not seem like much until you factor in three years ago , wages increased 1.8 % , and the @entity118 was up 3.5 %			2
and that may not seem like much until you realize that almost every year since 1983 , a series of small ticks like those two examples has been widening the gap between between what we earn and what we can buy			2
for a family of four in 1983 it was $ 10,178			0
adjusted for inflation , that should be $ 23,817.03 today			0
however , the actual 2013 poverty threshold is $ 23,492 , a difference of $ 325.03			0
when you 're living check to check , that 's a lot of money			0
when you 're living check to check with smaller checks to work with , luxuries quickly fall by the wayside			0
luxuries like going out to eat , which has slowed considerably since 2010			2
@entity19 is not the only restaurant seeing more empty seats than in years past			1
it 's just the one that happens to have an interesting tie to the poor folks i knew			0
the poor folks i know			0
as the nation talks about income inequality and the prospects of raising the minimum wage , it 's interesting to note that the true buying power of minimum wage peaked in 1968			0
that also happens to be the same year @entity19 was founded			1
i 'm no economist , but i doubt that the struggles of the working class and the struggles of a restaurant that depends on the working class for business are just a coincidence			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

@entity168 grew up poor , and a real treat once or twice a year was to go to @entity19
the chain is in financial trouble , which @entity174 says is tied to fewer people going out to eat
@entity174 : wages are down , and middle - class or working - class families are n't going out for dinner
@entity174 says @entity108 and other stores that cater to middle class are in trouble , too
