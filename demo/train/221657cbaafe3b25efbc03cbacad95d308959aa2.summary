-- the tragic death of @entity3 driver @entity2 after a horror race crash in the @entity5 should lead to changes in the @entity8 division , according to @entity10 legend @entity9			1
two - time indy 500 winner @entity2 lost his life on sunday after a multi-car collision on the 11th lap of the @entity16 's final race at the @entity17			1
@entity9 , who won @entity18 at the 1966 @entity19 before becoming a three - time @entity10 champion , told @entity0 that such a tragedy will prompt the sport to re-evaluate the current safety measures			1
" unfortunately , when accidents occur , it 's then that the more creative minds get moving on changing things , " said the 72 - year - old , who successfully campaigned for better safety precautions during his career			1
" some of them may be simple to change , some of them may be more complicated , but surely change occurs			0
@entity2 's death a watershed moment for @entity8 ? " a lot of people will be thinking , ' what are we going to have to do to avoid the @entity2 accident ? ' " is the track big enough to accommodate 34 racing cars ? is the track too fast to have 34 racing cars within a mile - and - a - half racing circuit ? will that change ? " @entity9 also questioned the wisdom of mixing drivers with varying levels of @entity8 experience in such a high - speed environment			1
" will the caliber of driver be high enough to be able to control those cars at those kinds of speeds ? in yesterday 's race there were a good many drivers in there who were not regulars and were not fulltime @entity8 drivers			1
i think that 's a consideration that has to be looked at			0
" motorsport reacts to @entity2 tragedy during @entity9 's eight years in f1 racing for the @entity68 and @entity69 teams from 1965 - 73 , the @entity65 witnessed 11 driver deaths			1
but the elite motorsport 's last casualty was in 1994 when the legendary @entity74 @entity73 crashed at the @entity75 , while @entity8 has seen four deaths in the last 15 years			0
" in the period that i was racing , there was a two out of three chance you were going to die if you lived for five years , and only one out of three you were going to live			0
in those days , motor racing truly was dangerous , " @entity9 said			2
" in these last years it 's been incredibly safe by comparison ... but that does n't mean to say it 's safe when you 're traveling at speeds of more than 200 miles per hour			0
" @entity9 said governing bodies can not do enough to protect racers			2
" if you 're in motorsport , whether you 're an administrator , a track owner , a governing body , a racing driver or a team owner , you 've got to be thinking about safety			2
there are always improvements able to be made , " he said			0
" modern technology , modern materials , it is available			0
it 's just a question of being able to think out of the box and have preventative medicine rather than just corrective medicine			0
