-- @entity2 's parliament on saturday began debating proposed amendments to the country 's constitution despite calls from the @entity7 not to proceed with any planned action			1
according to @entity2 's official news agency , @entity10 , the parliament agreed in principle to continue discussing the proposed constitutional amendments and then referred the matter to a special committee			2
the proposed amendments have caused much controversy since they were first proposed by @entity2 's ruling party , the @entity16 ( @entity16 )			0
the measures would increase parliamentary seats for women , reduce presidential terms in office and cancel presidential term limits , which are currently set at two consecutive terms			1
the @entity7 is concerned about continued instability in the country and wants opposition parties to be on board with the changes so that they will not boycott april 's parliamentary elections			1
a separatist movement in the country 's south and a delicate cease - fire in the north are still of concern to @entity7 president @entity37 's administration			1
after saturday 's parliamentary procedure , @entity2 's ruling party criticized the @entity7 call for a delay on the vote , calling it interference in internal affairs and its sovereignty , @entity10 reported , attributing it to an unnamed source in the @entity16			1
the ruling party has been in a dialogue with various political forces , the source told @entity10			0
@entity54 members protested outside the parliament saturday while discussions were ongoing			0
local journalists present in parliament saturday told @entity0 that 160 members of parliament agreed to form the subcommittee that will finalize the details of the proposed amendments within 60 days			0
many members of the opposition say they feel that long - promised reforms have not been delivered and that not enough time remains for appropriate action to be taken that would guarantee a fair poll			1
many in @entity2 worry the amendments will decrease the likelihood for reform even more and could allow @entity74 to appoint himself president for life			1
the @entity7 on friday urgently called on @entity2 " to delay parliamentary action " and asked all parties involved to return to the negotiating table			1
" the @entity7 has seen reports regarding the apparent decision by @entity2 's ruling @entity85 to vote on a package of constitutional reforms at a parliamentary session on saturday , january 1 , " acting @entity81 spokesman @entity80 said in a statement			1
" previously , we consistently welcomed and supported the commitments of both the government and the opposition to address issues related to constitutional reforms and other election reforms through the @entity96			2
we continue to believe that the interests of the @entity2 people will be best served through that process of negotiations			0
" @entity2 's president , @entity74 , has been in office for 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006			2
according to @entity103 , spokesman for the @entity2 embassy in @entity105 , @entity74 started a dialogue on the proposed amendments two years ago , but " coalition building efforts faced continuous hurdles and obstacles because of divisions amongst the opposition bloc			0
but there is still a window of opportunity to reach a reconciliation			0
" @entity103 said @entity2 's ruling party has made major concessions to the opposition			2
" the president 's call for the formation of a coalition government that will grant the opposition broader political representation before and after the upcoming parliamentary elections was flat out rejected , " he said			1
while @entity74 has formed a panel in recent days to engage in dialogue with the opposition , the political discord has only increased			0
according to the @entity129 , as of last wednesday , the opposition had boycotted parliamentary sittings for a fifth consecutive day			2
the parliamentary rift is causing concern among @entity2 's allies , who feel additional political tension could further destabilize the country			2
according to @entity80 's statement , the @entity7 welcomes " reports that president @entity74 has decided to appoint a new team from the ruling party to re-engage with the opposition in a new effort to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion			1
for that reason , we urgently call on all parties to delay parliamentary action and to return to the negotiating table to reach an agreement that will be welcomed by the @entity2 people as well as @entity2 's friends			1
" @entity2 has been locked in a struggle with @entity153 , or @entity153 , the @entity2 - based offshoot of the @entity153 terror network			0
it grabbed the attention of the @entity157 with the attempted bombing of a @entity162 trans - @entity160 flight as it landed in @entity163 , @entity164 , on christmas day in 2009			0
the anti-terror campaign has also come under increased international scrutiny since authorities in late october uncovered a cargo plane bomb plot targeting @entity157 interests			0
@entity153 claimed responsibility for the scheme , which involved shipping explosives disguised as printer toner cartridges on @entity7 - bound cargo planes .			0
