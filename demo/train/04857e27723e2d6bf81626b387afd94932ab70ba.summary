sen. @entity0 marked the 50th anniversary of the @entity2 at a ceremony this week honoring the late @entity4 , a renowned ophthalmologist and civil rights leader			1
it was part of his aggressive outreach to african - americans and other nontraditional @entity10 voters as he works to expand the @entity10 and as he crisscrosses the country laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign			1
it 's a community in which he has some fences to mend			0
while campaigning for the @entity17 four years ago , @entity0 sparked a firestorm for questioning parts of the historic law , especially its underpinnings that place restrictions on private property			2
the law gave the federal government too much power in telling business owners what they could and could not do , he argued			0
while he expressed strong abhorrence for racism , he said it was the job of communities , not the government , to fix discrimination in private places by boycotting such businesses			0
his argument lined up ideologically with his libertarian , limited - government leanings , but @entity39 have used his comments to try to define him as a civil rights opponent			0
@entity0 is now considered a likely presidential contender			2
and as the most active @entity10 leader in the effort to recruit african - americans to the @entity10 , his comments from four years ago have become a thorn in his side			1
political strategists say the senator has gotten better at framing his arguments in a less divisive manner			0
but in order to lay to rest controversy over his 2010 remarks , he needs to keep doing what he 's doing : try to convince african - americans and @entity59 voters that he 's an advocate for many of their views , and push his fellow @entity10 to join him in the effort			1
" if we 're going to be the white party , we 're going to be the losing party , " @entity0 said tuesday at the @entity64 while he was in town for the event honoring @entity4			2
@entity0 's questions about the law in april 2010 , @entity0 was asked by the @entity71 about his thoughts on the @entity2			1
he hailed the law for striving to end discrimination in the public domain , but he did n't fully approve of the government 's role in the process			0
" i think it 's a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant â € ” but , at the same time , i do believe in private ownership , " he said			0
he added that he agrees any publicly - funded entities should not be allowed to discriminate , but the law should n't necessarily apply to private businesses			0
" and that 's most of what i think the @entity2 was about in my mind			1
" so how would he resolve the problem ? consistent with his small - government philosophy , he said it should be up to the people to self - correct the issue			0
" in a free society , we will tolerate boorish people who have abhorrent behavior			0
but if we 're civilized people , we publicly criticize that and do n't belong to those groups , or do n't associate with those people , " he added			0
his comments were similar to the views of his father , former rep. @entity105 , who famously protested a 2004 vote in the @entity107 commemorating the 40th anniversary of the @entity2			1
the then - congressman said the law did not improve race relations , and it diminished individual liberty			0
defending his father , @entity0 said the problem with the law was the unintended consequences it had on property rights			2
" it 's not all about race relations			0
it is about controlling property , ultimately , " he said on @entity120 in january 2012			0
but @entity122 , a history professor at @entity123 , said the discussion around property rights was only a portion of the debate about the @entity2 at the time of passage			2
" saying the @entity2 was about property rights is sort of akin to those who say the @entity132 was about states ' rights , " he said			2
" the main objection , especially among the most rabid opponents , was to racial integration , assimilation , and race mixing			0
" ' concerned about the ramifications ' @entity0 also argued that the law set a dangerous precedent that 's paved a way for other restrictions on businesses , such as calorie - count regulations and smoking bans			1
while visiting @entity147 , a historically black college in @entity148 , @entity0 was questioned last year about his views on the law			2
he forcefully said he 's never come " out in opposition to the @entity2 or ever introduced anything to alter the @entity2			1
" rather , he 's been " concerned about the ramifications of certain parts of it beyond race , as they are now being applied to smoking , menus , listing calories and things on menus , and guns			0
" but historians say there 's no direct connection between the 1964 law and the federal regulations he mentioned			0
" i see absolutely nothing in the @entity2 as opposed to any other law which would lead to smoking bans , " said @entity169 , a professor and former dean of the @entity171 at the @entity172			2
a more likely connection , @entity169 added , would be linking smoking bans and menu restrictions to health laws mandating child vaccinations			0
there is one title ( out of 11 ) in the law that addresses private businesses			0
it states that certain entities are exempt from the law , such as small bed - and - breakfast type facilities , known colloquially as " mrs. @entity190 's @entity189 , " in which there are five or fewer bedrooms and where the owner is a full - time resident			0
in a may 2010 interview with @entity196 's @entity195 , @entity0 famously suggested that if he were around in 1964 , he " would have tried to modify that " section of the law and " there would have been some discussion " on property rights			1
the @entity202 in 2013 ran a fact - check of @entity0 's comments about the @entity2 over the years and gave him three out of four @entity205 for what they described as " rewriting history			1
" " it would be better to own up to his mistake â € ” if he now thinks it was one â € ” rather than sugarcoat it , " the article stated			0
an uphill battle perhaps more than any other @entity10 politician , @entity0 has been actively trying to expand the @entity10 by making it more attractive to african - americans			1
he started his outreach following the 2012 presidential election , when @entity10 @entity220 garnered only 6 % of that vote			1
@entity0 has made multiple trips to historically black colleges and urban centers , preaching a pro-school choice position and holding meetings with students and school leaders			1
last month he helped open a @entity230 @entity10 office in a predominantly @entity232 area in @entity233			1
in late july , he 'll address the @entity234 in @entity235			0
and in @entity236 , he 's working to restore voting rights for people convicted of nonviolent felonies , many of whom are minority voters , and he 's pushed his idea of " economic freedom zones " that would focus on improving struggling communities in urban areas			2
" i think you 'll find nobody in @entity236 doing more for minority rights than me , right now			0
@entity10 or @entity251 , " @entity0 told reporters tuesday in @entity250			1
@entity0 's policy messages will resonate with " the @entity232 of 2014 , " said @entity253 , an @entity232 businessman who 's traveled with the senator to urban areas and historically black schools -- though he stressed historical issues were still important to the black community			1
@entity253 said @entity0 's actions will ultimately speak louder than any comments he made in the past			1
" that 's what 's transcending a statement here , or a statement there , " he argued , predicting @entity0 will win people over in the long run			1
" i think you 'll see a lot of @entity39			0
" but @entity0 still faces an uphill battle in courting those voters			1
while he 's reaching out to african - americans on issues they care about , his political associations and ideology may be an obstacle for some			0
" the libertarian perspective has never been terribly strong in the @entity232 - @entity232 community precisely because it is tied to a private property argument that bears a very insidious connection to slavery and racial discrimination , " said @entity169 , the professor of public affairs , though he said he takes @entity105 at his word that the senator detests racism			2
" very few civil rights advocates have been libertarians , " @entity169 added , however			0
learning a valuable lesson as @entity0 works to appeal to african - americans on the policy front , he 'll need to continue sharpening his message skills			1
" he learned a very , very valuable lesson : if it 's too complicated to explain your position , you 're probably in trouble , " said @entity10 strategist @entity299			1
he 's tried to clean up and clarify his comments about the @entity2 , and in may 2012 , he told @entity120 's @entity306 that he would have voted for the bill in 1964 if he had the chance			1
he " would have been there marching with @entity310 " during the civil rights movement , he said			0
in a statement this week on the anniversary , @entity0 said the law " changed the future of our nation by enforcing the belief that all men and women are created equal			2
" when running for the @entity17 in 2010 , @entity0 was considered a newcomer to politics			1
he had campaigned for his father 's presidential bids and had been involved in political activism , but @entity0 's @entity17 run was his first big campaign of his own			2
strategists say his comments about the @entity2 were a rookie mistake ; @entity0 , who had been a practicing ophthalmologist for 17 years , was n't quite ready for the sound - bite friendly media			1
if @entity0 runs for president , @entity39 are almost certain to make sure his comments about the @entity2 overshadow any other efforts he 's made to appeal to @entity232			1
on tuesday for example , the @entity333 quickly pounced on the statement @entity0 released on the anniversary			2
in an email blast , the @entity333 reminded people of his @entity71 interview			0
@entity0 is " now trying to have it both ways , " the email stated			2
" no rhetoric can erase the number of instances where @entity0 has turned his back on the @entity2 that 's created a more fair and just @entity348 , " it continued			1
the response offered a glimpse at how @entity39 plan to target the likely presidential candidate			0
from a strategy standpoint , @entity299 said @entity0 has " gotten a lot better " at talking to the media and it 's " wise " for him to be active in appealing to the @entity232 - @entity232 community , not only for his own political future , but for the @entity10 as a whole			1
" his job between now and then is to continue what he 's doing with minority outreach and try to bury this every way possible , " he said .			2

@entity0 got in some *hot* water over his 2010 comments about the @entity2
*democrats* will likely make the controversy a line of attack if he runs for president
the @entity230 @entity10 is now trying to appeal to @entity232 voters
*experts* say he 's made strides with his outreach efforts , but needs to keep it up
