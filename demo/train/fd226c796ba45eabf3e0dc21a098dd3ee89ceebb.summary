@entity0 , @entity1 -- did @entity5 's @entity4 subsidiary pay bribes , in 2005 and earlier , to the @entity4 officials who grant permits for stores like @entity5 ? and did @entity5 cover up these actions for several years , after an internal investigation discovered the bribes , before finally reporting the internal investigation to the @entity14 and the @entity15 last december ? the answer , according to recent news accounts , is yes			1
this could mean that @entity5 violated the @entity19 , adopted in 1977 , which forbids @entity21 companies from paying bribes to foreign officials			1
if @entity5 violated the law , @entity21 officials should prosecute			1
no one should be above the law , whether the law is sensible or not			2
yet the public and policymakers should also consider whether the @entity19 is good policy			0
and despite good intentions -- particularly , the goal of reducing corruption -- it is not			0
the act is difficult to enforce on a consistent basis , since companies that wish to pay bribes can circumvent the law in numerous ways , mainly with minimal risk of exposure			1
so , most violations go undetected			0
the act therefore hurts companies that break the law clumsily and get caught , thereby creating a competitive advantage for companies that break the law cleverly and get away with it			1
the most likely outcome is therefore that the @entity19 has minimal impact on bribes but enriches the least honest companies			2
and if the act deters bribes by @entity21 companies operating abroad , that is even worse			1
the reason is that the threat of prosecution under the act discourages @entity21 companies from doing business abroad in the first place			1
this holds especially with respect to poor countries where corruption -- pay to play -- is endemic			0
thus foreign investment , along with the higher wages and increased competition this investment promotes , is less likely to occur in these countries , condemning their citizens to ongoing poverty			0
the act is also harmful , especially when it reduces bribes , because much bribery is an attempt to get around laws that make little sense in the first place			2
such laws include barriers to entry , union protections that make firing or plant closures all but impossible , and excessive environmental , health and safety regulation			0
these policies have good intentions , but they are frequently so onerous that their main effect is to discourage economic growth , which is critical for alleviating poverty			0
these policies are a key cause of corruption ; it is impossible to do business in some countries without paying bribes that limit the impact of costly regulations			0
the @entity5 example is a perfect illustration of this dynamic			1
@entity4 has a messy permitting process for allowing companies like @entity5 to open new stores			1
this permitting barrier is bad for @entity4 because it reduces the number of new @entity5 or slows their opening			2
@entity4 therefore pay higher prices for the wide array of inexpensive goods sold by @entity5			2
if these negatives were not enough , the act harms @entity21 companies relative to those from other countries that do not face something like the @entity19			1
other countries have adopted similar laws in recent years , but enforcement is often weak			0
corruption is a huge problem in many countries , especially the developing world			0
much of the corruption , however , arises from excessive government that hurts economic productivity and creates the incentive to pay bribes			0
the best solution is to scale back these aspects of government			0
since that is not always possible , however , it is better to allow companies from the @entity21 and other rich countries to pay the bribes that diminish the negative impact of excessive government			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			2

@entity145 : @entity5 is facing *allegations* it covered up a bribery *scandal*
he says the company should be prosecuted if it violated the law
@entity145 says the law forbidding bribery overseas is a *mistake* , penalizes @entity21 companies
he says law discourages @entity21 companies from doing business in the poorest *nations*
