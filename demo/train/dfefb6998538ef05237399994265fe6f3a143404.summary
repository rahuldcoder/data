-- emblazoned on a long , tall , concrete barrier in the midst of a rocky @entity4 landscape is this spray - painted message : " @entity6 on the wall			1
when will this senseless object fall ? " messages of peace , marriage proposals and jokes are among the most popular graffiti requests			1
it 's one of more than 900 graffiti messages that have been spray - painted by @entity16 on the controversial wall that separates @entity18 and the @entity19			1
the painters take orders through a web site that lets customers get a message on the wall			1
for the equivalent of $ 40 , a @entity16 will spray paint the message and send three digital photos of it			2
anything goes -- marriage proposals , jokes , notes to friends -- as long as it is n't extremist , hate - filled , or pornographic , said @entity38 , one of the founders of the site			1
" trying to imagine a clear view between @entity43 and @entity18 , " one message reads			2
" if all humans are equal , why do they have to live separated ? " says another			0
and another simply shouts : " get along with each other ! " " this is an alternative way to send your message to whoever you 're sending it to , " @entity38 told @entity0 from @entity47			0
" it is there physically and it will stay there until someone sprays over it or someone decides to demolish that wall ... hopefully it wo n't stay forever , because hopefully this wall will be removed sometime soon			0
" the @entity18 government began building the barrier in 2002 , about two years after renewed violence erupted in @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity65			1
in some areas , it takes the form of a tall concrete wall ; in others , it is more of a fence			2
@entity18 says the barrier has been successful in preventing terrorist attacks by @entity16			1
but @entity16 say it amounts to an illegal land grab of @entity16 territory because it does not match the line of @entity18 's border with the @entity19 before the @entity79			1
the barrier cuts so far into @entity19 territory at some points that the @entity19 settlement of @entity83 and five @entity16 villages are actually now on the @entity18 side of the wall			1
palestinians in those villages contend they are cut off from both @entity18 and the @entity19 because they are not allowed to travel into @entity18 and they must pass through military checkpoints to reach other @entity19 villages			1
the @entity92 web site says other families cut off by the barrier are deprived of their livelihoods			1
the site describes how the wall separated a family from the hotel they owned and kept farmers away from their 500 olive trees			0
@entity18 's supreme court has twice ruled that the government must reroute sections of the barrier to avoid infringing on the lives of thousands of @entity16			1
@entity38 represents a @entity16 non-profit group , the @entity107 , that works on the social and political issues facing young people in the @entity19			1
about two - thirds of the money raised through the site goes to the group , which uses it to pay for projects like building a playground , buying bicycles , or establishing laundry facilities for university students in @entity121 , near @entity47			2
the group says it only works with organizations that are legal in the @entity16 territories and allowed to operate by the @entity18 government			1
the rest of the money goes to the group 's partners in the @entity129 , who maintain the web site , accept payments , and manage the paperwork			1
first conceived at a @entity129 - @entity16 workshop in @entity47 two years ago , the site has gone on to attract customers from around the world			1
there have been 910 orders so far , said @entity140 , a @entity129 screenwriter who volunteers his time maintaining the site in the @entity129			2
spray - painting on the wall is a peaceful way for @entity16 to protest the barrier , @entity38 said			1
" you 're not only defying the existence of the wall , but you 're also showing the international community our refusal , first of all , to such a structure , " he said			0
" also , it 's an attempt to humanize the @entity16 society in the eyes of the world , showing that the @entity16 are not just militants who are violently resisting occupation			2
" there are other benefits to the project , too , @entity38 said			0
the rest of the world can get a glimpse , however small , into the @entity16 ' lives behind the wall -- and the @entity16 get a sense that they 're not forgotten , @entity38 said			2
" there 's no big concept , " @entity140 told @entity0			0
" the wall wo n't fall because texts are on it , but the people behind the wall , they will have a face			0
it 's also about beauty and poetry			0
" poetry is indeed on the wall , as are emotional pleas to take the wall down			0
marriage proposals are a frequent order , @entity38 said , but so are jokes and funny messages			1
" we had a series of obviously @entity191 ( people ) making silly jokes about each other , because the names were just being repeated and repeated , " he said			0
" we also got a message supposedly from a dog , asking the neighbor 's dog to come out and play in the sun. " the diversity of the messages is something @entity38 says he finds incredible			0
" we 've covered most of the aspects of human life , " he said			0
@entity205 , a @entity129 theater director , used the site to propose to his girlfriend			0
his plan was to feature a picture of the spray - painted proposal on a @entity129 news broadcast about the wall and make sure his girlfriend , a journalist , was watching -- but the picture never aired			2
" then i thought , well , i have this photo of a @entity16 boy who 's writing my proposal on the wall , " @entity205 wrote to @entity0			2
" i 've got a notebook ( computer )			0
i could save the photo ( onto ) my desktop and show it to my girlfriend , just that plain and simple			0
and when she saw this , she said ' yes ' and cried , " he said			0
@entity205 said he heard about the site through @entity140 , a friend , and liked the idea right away			0
" i thought it was a brilliant idea to have something beautiful written on an ugly wall , " he told @entity0			0
the @entity231 is also planning to spray - paint an entire letter written by @entity234 human rights activist @entity233 next month			2
it 's looking for customers to sponsor a portion of the letter in exchange for having their name signed onto the end			0
in the letter , @entity233 compares the situation in the @entity16 territories to @entity234 under apartheid , the web site says .			1
