the exact cause of the flash that caused hundreds of people to call the media , local authorities and the @entity23 was still unknown monday afternoon			0
but eyewitness accounts of the color , shape and timing of the light and sound had officials at the @entity12 confident of the phenomenon 's cause : the re-entry of orbiting space junk from the @entity9 soyuz spacecraft that blasted off last week from @entity36			1
" an object like this will have a pretty spectacular display when it enters the atmosphere , " said @entity12 spokesman @entity37			2

ireport.com : did you see the mysterious flash ? sunday 's mysterious flash and booms also could have been a fireball , a natural phenomenon that occurs when a rock about the size of a suitcase slams into the earth			0
@entity12 officials say that scenario is unlikely in this case , since the space junk was already orbiting in the area			1
@entity37 said the yellow , orange and iridescent green flashes reported by witnesses resemble both fireballs and burning space junk			1
" the visual reports are consistent with either case , " he said			2
" but the fact that a @entity9 rocket booster was passing through that area of the sky at the same time , it 's a pretty strong factor in my opinion to make that the culprit			1
