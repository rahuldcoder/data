@entity0 -- @entity3 leaders reacted angrily thursday to president @entity5 's decision to slap further sanctions on @entity3 banks , energy firms and defense companies over @entity3 's actions in @entity11			1
" sanctions are evil , " said prime minister @entity12 , as he warned that the steps taken by @entity14 and the @entity15 would lead to worsening relations -- and possible @entity3 retaliation			1
@entity3 's @entity19 warned that it would not " tolerate blackmail " and reserved the right to take countermeasures , according to the state - run @entity23 news agency			1
deputy prime minister @entity26 was similarly defiant , tweeting : " the sanctions imposed by @entity14 on @entity3 defense sector majors are unlawful and demonstrate that the @entity29 is engaged in unfair competition on the arms market			1
" anyway , the @entity29 can not put a lid on the ongoing re-arming of the @entity3 armed forces or shatter the export potential of our defense sector			0
" as deadly violence continues to roil eastern @entity11 , @entity15 leaders also said they intended to increase sanctions , signaling growing @entity42 concern about @entity3 's continued support for the separatists battling the @entity11 military			1
@entity11 jet ' shot down ' tensions between @entity11 and its larger neighbor showed no sign of easing thursday , as @entity11 officials reportedly accused a @entity3 fighter of shooting down a @entity11 jet the previous evening while it was flying in @entity11 airspace			1
" a military plane of the @entity59 launched a missile strike against an su - 25 aircraft of the @entity62 , which performed tasks on @entity11 territory , " @entity11 's @entity55 spokesman @entity54 was quoted as saying by the official @entity57 news agency			2
" our plane was shot down , " he said , adding that the pilot ejected and was picked up safely by @entity11 forces			2
in response to the expanded sanctions , @entity11 prime minister @entity69 in @entity70 had tough words for @entity3			1
" it is time to pay for violating the international law , military aggression , constant supply of weapons from @entity3 to the territory of @entity11 , financing militants who kill civilians and try to destroy @entity11 , " he said			1
" @entity3 will pay for the war it started against @entity11			1
" the @entity83 said wednesday that @entity3 now had 12,000 troops on the border with @entity11 , as well as some heavy weapons			1
the troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year			0
@entity11 's government has accused @entity3 of allowing weapons and military equipment , including tanks , to cross the border illegally into the hands of @entity97 separatists			1
@entity42 officials have leveled the same charges at @entity0 and urged it to act to ease the situation or face economic consequences and increased diplomatic isolation			0
@entity12 : we 'll take measures in response however , @entity0 insists that the @entity42 's sanctions will only worsen the situation			2
" they never bring success to those who implement them , " @entity12 said of sanctions , as he addressed the government in remarks broadcast on @entity3 24			1
" so - called sectoral sanctions implemented by the @entity29 unfortunately will lead to a growth of anti-american and @entity120 mood in @entity3			2
we will come back to the 1980s			0
if that 's our partner 's goal , then they achieved it			0
" @entity12 said @entity3 would have to look at its financing for defense and security measures in light of the pressure being put on it			2
" if our partners carry on sanctions , we 'll take measures against foreign companies and people in response , " he warned			0
" these sanctions wo n't help @entity11			1
" his words echoed a warning by @entity3 president @entity139 on wednesday that the sanctions are already harming ties between his nation and the @entity29			2
" they generally have a boomerang effect and , without a doubt , in this case , are driving the @entity3 - @entity29 relations into a stalemate and seriously damaging them , " he said , according to a @entity144 transcript of his remarks to reporters on a visit to @entity148			0
" i am certain that this is harmful to the @entity156 and @entity29 people 's long - term strategic national interests			0
" he accused the @entity29 of pushing @entity11 authorities toward a continued conflict , whereas @entity3 wants to see an immediate end to hostilities and a negotiated solution involving all sides , he said			2
financing squeeze , assets freeze announcing the sanctions wednesday at the @entity168 , @entity5 said , " we have to see concrete actions , and not just words that @entity3 in fact is committed to trying to end this conflict along the @entity3 - @entity11 border			1
" with the new sanctions , " what we are expecting is that the @entity3 leadership will see once again that its actions in @entity11 have consequences , including a weakening economy and increasing diplomatic isolation , " he said			1
the expanded @entity29 measures target two @entity3 banks -- @entity184 and @entity185 -- and two energy companies -- @entity187 and @entity188			0
they will not be able to get new medium - and long - term financing in the @entity29 , senior administration officials told reporters in a conference call			0
in addition , the new sanctions freeze any @entity29 assets and prohibit @entity29 business contacts for eight @entity3 arms companies that make weapons , including small arms , mortars and surface - to - air missiles			2
one of the eight is the @entity203 , maker of the @entity205 assault rifle and other arms			0
also on the list : four @entity3 government officials , including the minister of @entity211 affairs ; the self - styled @entity212 and @entity213 leading the separatist campaign in eastern @entity11 ; and @entity215 , the self - declared " prime minister " of the @entity216			1
targeting the separatist groups that simulate government structures prevents them from seeking financing , the senior administration officials noted			0
a statement published on the @entity15 website wednesday said the @entity223 would decide by the end of july on which entities and individuals to target with expanded sanctions over their actions in @entity11			0
the council also asked the @entity230 to reassess @entity15 - @entity3 cooperation programs , with a view to deciding , on a case - by - case basis , on suspending their implementation			0
" the @entity223 urges the @entity3 to actively use its influence over the illegally armed groups and to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border , in order to achieve a rapid deescalation , " the statement said			0
earlier this year , the @entity29 and @entity244 imposed a range of sanctions in response to @entity3 's annexation of @entity211 this spring and massing of troops along @entity11 's eastern border			1
the earlier sanctions included asset freezes and travel bans			0
