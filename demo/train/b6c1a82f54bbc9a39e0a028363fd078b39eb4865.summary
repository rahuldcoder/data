' the brink of civil war ' @entity1 is on " the brink of civil war , " col. @entity49 , a prominent commander from @entity35 , said in a televised statement , which he said was from the command of the self - declared @entity53			1

a country awash in weapons and frustrations @entity1 's revolution left the country awash in weapons in the hands of various militias divided along regional , tribal and political lines that have competing agendas and affiliations			2
many of the militias fought the @entity9 regime in 2011 and have refused to disarm and disband			0
thousands more @entity1 have taken up arms since @entity9 fell			2
the government 's attempts to build state security forces have failed so far , and those in authority have relied on militias for protection			2
