two other volunteer firefighters were wounded in the attack in the @entity10 - area town of @entity11			1
a police officer from the nearby town of @entity14 suffered minor shrapnel wounds when his vehicle was hit by gunfire			2
investigators believe the suspect , @entity19 , 62 , set the original fire , then likely set himself up on a berm with a clear view of the scene and started shooting			1
" it appears that it was a trap , " webster police chief @entity24 said			1
" there was a car and a house that were involved in flames , probably set by mr. @entity19 , who laid in wait in armament and then shot the first responders			1
" authorities do not know how @entity19 -- who was found dead of a self - inflicted gunshot wound hours after the four firefighters were shot -- obtained the weapon or weapons he used or why he opened fire , @entity24 told reporters			1
as a convicted felon , @entity19 was not allowed to legally possess weapons , but he had " several different types of weapons " monday , the police chief said			1
@entity19 was convicted in 1981 of first - degree manslaughter in the death of his grandmother and had been released on supervised parole , @entity24 said			1
@entity50 man who shot dead 2 firefighters killed grandmother in 1980 he is believed to have lived in the home where the original fire erupted with his sister , who has not yet been accounted for , @entity24 said			1

in chilling audio heard over the scanner , a @entity60 firefighter reported " multiple firemen shot " -- including himself , with wounds to his lower back and lower leg -- and " shots still being fired			1
" " i 'm pretty sure that we have two @entity70 " -- the term for dead on arrival -- " on the street , " the wounded firefighter said			1
" ... they 're down and not good			0
" for several hours after that monday , the threat of gunfire stopped firefighters from battling the blaze and forced police @entity80 teams to evacuate 33 people in the neighborhood of small , waterfront homes			1
eventually , seven houses were " totally destroyed " by the fire			1
although the fires were under control as of 2:30 p.m. et , by then authorities still had n't been able to get in any of the homes			0
@entity24 said it 's possible more victims could be inside			0
" i 'm hoping that everyone was able to escape from the inferno , " he said			2
" those houses were close together			2
" with ' raging inferno ' and gunfire , scene described as ' chaos ' firefighters first arrived at the @entity11 fire before 6 a.m. , said @entity102 , the town 's fire marshal			1
by then , @entity19 had set up himself somewhere above the scene in a " natural hollow , a position of cover to actually be a sniper , " @entity24 explained			1
the calls from firefighter came in soon after , reporting that four of them had been shot			2
police officers rushed to the scene , and one of the first ones there exchanged fire , " in all likelihood , ( saving ) many lives , " according to the police chief			2
" when we get there , we have people down , we have raging fires , and we have gunshots going off , " @entity24 said			0
" authorities worked quickly to set up a perimeter , trying to contain the situation and the shooter			2
neighborhood residents were first told to " shelter in place " because the gunman was at large , but some left their homes because of the fire			2
several people could be seen running			0
police tracked some of them down , found they were neighbors seeking safety and escorted them out			1
eventually , residents were whisked from the area in armored personnel carriers			0
all the while , there was " this raging inferno , with black smoke everywhere , " @entity24 said			2
no more gunfire was exchanged after that initial burst , though police did see a man they believed to be @entity19 moving at times			1
the police chief said he did n't know if the police officer hit @entity19 early on , but he said the medical examiner indicated that @entity19 died after shooting himself in the head			1
two firefighters also died at the scene			2
one of them , lt. @entity162 , was a veteran of the @entity60 and a police lieutenant			2
he 'd been named @entity165 just two weeks ago , and not long before that , he had volunteered to go to @entity167 to help those suffering after @entity168 , according to lt. gov. @entity169			2
the other slain firefighter was @entity171 , who was also a 911 dispatcher			2
he 'd been with the @entity60 for just more than a year , fire department spokesman @entity172 said			0
one firefighter escaped from the scene in his own vehicle about an hour after he was shot and was taken to a hospital by an ambulance from another location , @entity102 said			0
another wounded firefighter was conscious and speaking when he was removed from the scene , he said			1
the wounded firefighters were in intensive care monday at @entity184 in @entity10 , @entity6 , officials said			1
the other person wounded was a @entity14 , @entity6 , police officer who was on his way to work when his car was fired upon			1
he suffered shrapnel wounds that @entity24 described as minor			0
" we work with these people everyday ; they 're like our brothers , " said @entity24 of the slain firefighters , as he fought back tears			0
" new shooting spurs more talk on gun control authorities have not said what weapons were found with @entity19 , though @entity24 said " probably at least a rifle was used " to shoot the first responders			1
" i know that many people are going to be asking , ' were they assault rifles ? ' i do n't know that			0
i ca n't answer that at this time , " he told reporters			0
the shooting occurred amid a renewed gun control debate after the december 14 elementary school massacre in @entity210 , @entity211 , that killed 26 people , most of them children			0
the gunman in that case , @entity215 , also killed his mother and himself			1
the head of a lobbying group that represents first responders said the monday shooting was " senseless and cruel			0
" " the firefighters who responded today were performing a selfless , meaningful service to their community , unaware that a cold - hearted maniac was planning to ambush them and take their lives , " said @entity223 , general president of the @entity225 - based @entity224			1
" coming on the heels of the horrific tragedy in @entity210 , @entity211 , and on christmas eve , this shooting is even harder to comprehend			0
" @entity6 gov. @entity234 described the @entity11 shooting as " horrific			0
" and the state 's attorney general called it a " senseless tragedy " president @entity239 has set a january deadline for " concrete proposals " to deal with gun violence in the wake of the @entity210 school shooting			0
sen. @entity245 , @entity246 , has said she will introduce legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , while @entity250 ceo @entity249 has said his group will fight any new gun restrictions , saying most gun laws now on the books are rarely enforced			0
@entity24 , the @entity11 police chief , said it was important -- in the wake of the shooting in his town and others -- to " get a handle on gun control			0
" he also said more needs to be done to make sure that dangerous people are n't in society , where they can kill			0
" for the last 20 years we have been turning people loose and deinstitutionalizing people , and i think we 've swung too far , " he said			0
" i think there are still people that need to be in institutions that are a danger to themselves or others			0
and this is a classic example			0
" are you there ? share your stories , pictures and videos , but stay safe .			0
