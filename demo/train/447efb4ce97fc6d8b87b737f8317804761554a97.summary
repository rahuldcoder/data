-- anytime @entity1 , @entity3 and @entity4 hold hands and jump for joy , it 's worth pondering how to turn their joy into tears			1
they 're jubilant -- just ecstatic -- about @entity14 's @entity13 victory			1
on the eve of the @entity13 primary , @entity1 opined in a @entity0 column addressed to @entity19 leaders , " let me break it to you gently -- you 've got a first - class disaster on your hands			1
" not to be outdone , @entity24 blustered in the @entity25 , " above it all we can hear the weeping , the wailing , the gnashing of teeth of the @entity19 establishment as @entity33 's victory sends them into full - blown panic			1
" you know what ? if @entity14 becomes the @entity19 nominee , they might be right			1
but they also might be wrong			0
i get a kick out of @entity43 thinking they know how handicap a @entity19 race			2
if @entity43 were good at thinking like @entity19 , they would see the light and stop being @entity43			2
but instead , @entity43 are so bent on seeing republicans as a bunch of angry , right wing , intolerant , unreliable extremists that they have a track record of missing the mood of the country , especially the sentiment of people who do n't wake up to the @entity59			0
here 's what @entity61 chair rep. @entity60 , @entity62 , said just three months before the november 2010 elections : " really it 's hard to know where the @entity19 ends and the tea party begins			2
... so it has really caused , i think , a pretty difficult problem for them going into the november elections because they have candidates ... on the extreme right - wing fringe who want to end @entity75 as we know it , yank the rug -- the safety net out from under our senior citizens			0
i mean , @entity81 really are going to have a very clear choice set up in november between moderate @entity43 who are centrists , where the country is , and @entity19 who are really off on the right - wing fringe			0
" three months later , the tea party led republicans to their biggest mid-term election victory in 72 years , winning a remarkable 63 seats in the @entity90 , along with six in the @entity91			0
and do n't forget in 1980 , @entity43 were cheering for @entity92 to win the @entity19 presidential nomination , thinking he was too conservative and too much of a cowboy to appeal to mainstream voters			1
of course , @entity92 went on to a 44 - state , 10 - point thumping of incumbent @entity98			0
leading @entity43 , and the most of the media , similarly dismissed the @entity100 and the possibility that voters could elect the first @entity19 @entity90 in 40 years when that took place in 1994 , led by their favorite right wing , unsteady extremist , @entity14			1
given president @entity107 's significant problem winning the support of working class , blue collar @entity81 , i would n't be so jubilant if i were on the other side			1
not only is @entity81 being led by a president who thinks blue collar @entity81 cling to their religion and guns , or that the @entity116 police were " stupid " when they did their job , but the economy is bad , unemployment is high and the debt is out of sight			0
this president , who was elected essentially having the experience of a state senator , is in over his head and is vulnerable to defeat both substantively and personally			0
as anyone who knows @entity14 knows , he indeed could blow himself up and the dancing democrats may have reason for joy			2
but i would n't be too quick to discount @entity14 's ability to strike a chord with working class , upset with @entity132 , ready - for - change voters who will overlook @entity14 's personal problems because they 're drawn to his blunt , direct , tough talk			1
i also would n't so easily discount the possibility that the @entity139 sentiment and the desire for deep and meaningful change in @entity132 might propel @entity14 to a position none of us , myself included , could have imagined two days ago			0
follow @entity144 on @entity145 join the conversation on @entity147 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

democrat @entity1 said @entity19 have a disaster on their hands
@entity150 says @entity1 misses the appeal of @entity14 to working class
he says the former *speaker* can tap into *widespread* *dissatisfaction* with @entity107
@entity150 : @entity33 could blow up his chances , but it 's possible he could win
