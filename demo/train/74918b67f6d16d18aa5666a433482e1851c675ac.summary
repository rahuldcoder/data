@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 presidential candidates faced off twice in 11 hours on saturday and sunday in debates ahead of tuesday 's @entity1 primary			2
while both debates were staged in the @entity1 , it was clear that the rivals intended for their messages to go beyond @entity1			0
here are five things we learned from the weekend			2
@entity14 's debating skills on display neither debate did much to change the state of play in @entity1			1
front - runner @entity14 's rivals went after him in both debates			1
even when other candidates slighted @entity14 -- @entity22 referred to an " insider from @entity24 , " and @entity25 went after @entity14 's private - sector record by repeatedly citing an article by @entity28 -- the jabs were either veiled or dispassionate			1
and using the @entity28 to back up an argument probably wo n't excite the conservative base			0
@entity14 's opponents did step up their attacks between saturday and sunday , but then they seemed to back off			1
@entity2 opinion contributor @entity34 , an award - winning college debating coach , speculated that @entity14 's rivals dropped the direct attacks because they were " worried about overcorrecting , appearing rude , and alienating voters ( @entity25 came close when he told @entity14 to ' drop the pious baloney ' ) -- or in the heat of the moment , they forgot their coaching once the second debate was under way			1
" @entity34 concluded that between @entity14 's polished debating skills and sometimes poor debating by his rivals , he has only solidified his position			1
looking ahead to the general election ? over the past few years , the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights movement has made strides , and many question whether someone who is not a supporter of the movement could win a general election in 2012			0
such rights played a role in both debates			2
@entity66 , who has run on a predominantly social values platform , offered perhaps his strongest statement of homosexual support to date , saying he would not repudiate a son who told him he was gay			2
he was careful , however , not to say that he would fight for gay individuals , instead saying he would be an advocate for " every person in @entity73 " and would make sure people are treated with " respect and dignity			0
" on the same topic , @entity14 said he has hired gay staffers in the past and would never discriminate against gays or attempt to take away their rights			1
are these two men looking ahead to a general election , where strong social conservative values may not play as well ? social issues played a big role in @entity87 and will do so again in @entity88			1
@entity66 's answer may have been a good middle - of - the - road response and a reminder of a phrase often used by @entity94 conservatives : love the sinner , hate the sin			0
that may be a message to which conservative voters in @entity88 can relate			1
message received ? @entity73 have made clear their disdain for @entity102 , partisan politics and theatrics bringing government to a standstill			0
both @entity25 and @entity14 touted their records of working with @entity108 to hammer out legislative deals			1
@entity25 , who is best known for battling president @entity110 in the 1990s , highlighted that he struck deals with the @entity108 president even though he wanted to make him " a one - term president			1
" and @entity14 noted that when he was running @entity115 , the state legislature was 85 % @entity108 but that he found " common ground , " adding that he 's proved he can " work with @entity4 and @entity108 who are willing to work together			1
" @entity66 touted his ability to gain support among voters of both parties in his former @entity123 district , and @entity124 said that serving one 's country should always trump party loyalty			0
but before candidates can work on uniting the party , they will have to triumph over their rivals as the bruising @entity4 primary plays out this winter			0
@entity124 's last stand ? since former @entity137 gov. @entity124 is placing all his chips on a strong finish in @entity1 's tuesday primary , the debates were his last , best chance to make his case			0
saturday 's lukewarm performance was followed by a stronger delivery on sunday morning			0
after coming under attack saturday night by @entity14 for his service as @entity73 ambassador to @entity148 during the first two years of president @entity150 's term , @entity124 strongly defended his time in @entity152 on sunday			1
but he also highlighted his fiscal plans as in tune with conservative @entity4 principles			0
and in a state where independent voters hold sway , @entity124 made his pitch , saying , " the @entity73 people are tired of the partisan division			0
and i say , we 've had enough , and we have to change our direction in terms of coming together as @entity73 first and foremost and finding solutions to our problems			0
" @entity168 punches hard -- in person the candidates have let super political action committees that support them do their dirty work on the campaign trail , spending millions on attack ads. but @entity168 was one of the few candidates to repeat to his rivals ' faces the same harsh criticism he 's unleashed in ads or on the campaign trail			1
@entity168 stood firm in calling @entity66 " corrupt " and @entity25 a " chicken hawk " for not having served in the military			1
" would you use that phrase ( chicken hawk ) again ? " moderator @entity184 asked @entity168 on saturday			2
" yeah , " @entity168 responded			2
" i think people who do n't serve when they could and they get three or four or even five deferments are n't -- they have no right to send our kids off to war			0
" i 'm trying to stop the wars , " he said			0
" but at least , you know , i went when they called me up			0
" @entity25 responded with anger			2
" dr. @entity168 has a long history of saying things that are inaccurate and false , " he said , denying that he had asked for a deferment and pointing out that his father had served overseas			2
" i think i have a pretty good idea of what it 's like as a family to worry about your father getting killed , and i personally resent the kinds of comments and aspersions ( @entity168 ) routinely makes without accurate information and then just slurs people			1
" @entity2 's @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0
