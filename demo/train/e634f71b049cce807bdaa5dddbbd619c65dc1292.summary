-- editor 's note : this story may contain spoilers @entity6 studios confirmed friday that it will not cancel any screenings of " @entity8 , " squashing any rumors that it might dial back the release following the mass shooting at an @entity13 , @entity14 , theater			1
the shooting rampage that left at least 12 movie patrons dead and dozens more injured reignited the gun debate in the @entity19 -- a debate that actually figures into the movie itself			1
the film kicks off in a violence - free gotham			2
but soon the bad guys emerge and so , too , does a retired @entity26 , to deal with them			0
shooting casts pall over ' @entity8 ' blockbuster weekend in one scene the hero ( once again played by @entity30 ) jumps into a fight already in progress between @entity34 ( @entity35 ) and about half a dozen villains			1
when the two masked characters seize the upper hand , @entity34 grabs a gun to finish the job			2
but @entity26 stops her , telling her he does n't use guns			0
she grudgingly concedes and the two make their escape			0
the good guys win this battle without killing anyone and without the use of guns			0
but this singular anti-gun moment is soon turned on its head			0
theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media about an hour and countless acts of violence later , @entity26 is about to be killed by the film 's antagonist , @entity54			1
during what is arguably the film 's most pivotal scene , @entity34 repays @entity26 's earlier life - saving favor			1
however , she does it her way , by blasting @entity54 away , killing him with a piece of artillery attached to the " @entity64 " -- the film 's motorcycle - like vehicle			1
then @entity34 , in a made - for - the - big - screen moment , reminds @entity26 that she does n't agree with that whole " no guns " thing			0
the cinematographic message is clear : small battles are one thing , but to win the war , the use of guns is not only acceptable , it 's probably required			2
theater offers ' perfect killing ' zone as the film continues to play on 4,400 screens around the country , audiences may be struck by the mixed message in " @entity8			1
" @entity26 neutralizes his opponents with fisticuffs and other means , but he never applies deadly force			0
and his plea against using guns may ring hollow when , presumably for the sake of entertainment , filmmakers pack the movie with plenty of violence from guns , bombs and other heavy weaponry			0
in light of the shooting , how do you feel about gun control and public safety ? let us know on @entity107 .			2
