-- it looks like a regular bike light , but one day a @entity3 could save your life			1
invented by a @entity7 design student , @entity3 is a detachable lamp that projects a laser image five meters in front of your bicycle to let motorists , bus drivers and pedestrians know you are coming			1
@entity3 's inventor , @entity16 , a physics student turned product designer , came up with the idea while she was studying at @entity20 university			2
" while studying i knew the problem that i wanted to tackle very clearly : sideswiping or blind spot incidents where vehicles turn across a cyclist 's path			0
" incidences of cycling fatalities remain a problem in most major capitals around the world			0
as more and more commuters travel to work on two wheels rather than four , a myriad of new safety equipment , infrastructure and road rules are being introduced to keep cyclists out of harm 's way			1
in many cities in the @entity41 and beyond , cycling is on the rise			0
according to statistics published by @entity45 , cycling has grown exponentially in most major @entity41 cities since 2006			0
in @entity49 cycling has more than doubled in the last decade and in many cities in the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , cycling now accounts for more than 20 % of urban trips			0
in spite of a gradual decline , urban cycling also remains hugely popular across @entity58			0
@entity16 says that her primary motivation for inventing the @entity3 was to improve cyclist safety : " last year over 3,000 people were killed or seriously injured on @entity7 's roads alone			1
we have over half a million people cycle in @entity49 every day and the fatality statistics are really terrifying			0
over a hundred people were killed last year			1
the fact that i really wanted to focus on was the 79 % of cyclists hit were travelling straight ahead and a vehicle turned into them so that was the one cyclist that i really focused on in designing @entity3 , " @entity16 says			1
blaze is a front - mounted light powered by bright leds that also projects a green laser image of a bicycle onto the road to let motorists know a cyclist is coming			1
the aim is to help prevent vehicles from turning across a cyclist 's path of cyclists by increasing their ' footprint ' on the road			1
it is one of a new crop of tech products aimed at improving cyclist safety			0
the annual @entity93 conference , which opens next week , will showcase a large number of new products including a device that emits high frequency audio signals to keep pursuing dogs at bay			0
also being launched soon is a set of ' smart handle bars ' fitted with led lights that adjust to your environment and speed			0
they will also track your bike via @entity110 if it is stolen			2
@entity111 have a glow - in - the - dark bike frame to light up your entire bicycle at night			1
dr @entity115 , a senior lecturer in @entity117 at the @entity118 , says that increasing visibility could be critical to keeping cyclists safe : " @entity16 's invention could be a major aid to detecting cyclists			1
it gives the driver advance warning of a cyclist 's approach ... it has the potential to make a significant difference to cyclists ' safety on the roads			2
" read more : 12 amazing designs from the past 100 years @entity135 , editor of @entity136 agrees that products that aim to increase cyclist visibility could be useful in preventing accidents : " anything that increases conspicuity has got to be a good thing , although in the @entity7 cyclists and motorcyclists have a saying about those motorists who knock into us			1
we call such collisions : @entity149 -- ' sorry mate i did n't see you			0
' " many cyclists believe that rather than developing new technology , safe cycling requires changes in the attitudes and behaviors of road users			2
@entity160 , president of the @entity161 says : " clearly , better bike infrastructure encourages more riders , makes things safer for both cyclists and motorists , and encourages better behavior by riders -- all of which are good things			1
" but perhaps more fundamental than any road design or technological fix attached to cars or bikes is an improvement in operator behavior ! getting drivers to pay attention and be a little more patient ( with everybody , not just cyclists ) would make the world of difference out there			2
distracted , drunk , drugged , drowsy and just plain poor driving is a real scourge -- especially if you are on foot or on a bike			2
