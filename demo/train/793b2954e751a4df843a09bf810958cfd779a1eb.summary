-- nearly four months after a @entity1 veered out of control and slammed into spectators at the @entity4 , @entity5 , air races -- killing 11 people , injuring scores of others and jeopardizing the future of the event -- race organizers wednesday said the show will go on			1
the head of the @entity15 said the association will seek permits for the full schedule of races to take place september 12 - 16 and is confident that it will get them			1
if not , he said , organizers will stage a one - time - only memorial event to commemorate those killed and injured last year , and will bring an end to the 49 - year - old tradition			2
" many of the victims , their families , air race teams and fans have told us they 're coming to @entity4 this september no matter what , " said @entity27 , president and ceo of the @entity15 , at a @entity4 press conference			2
" and we feel it 's our obligation to give them something , no matter what			0
" @entity27 said the association is doing everything possible to assure that all features of the races will continue , including the unlimited class race , which featuring planes flying at low altitudes in excess of 500 mph			0
it was unclear how close spectators would be allowed and whether that would include areas in which they were killed or hurt in the september crash			1
the event relies on the races to attract its 200,000 fans , who contribute an estimated $ 85 million to the local economy , @entity27 said , and it would not be economically viable as a more traditional air show			2
in an apparent effort to win government support for the races , the association created a " blue ribbon review panel " that included two well - known former government officials , former @entity65 chairman @entity64 and former @entity67 official @entity66			1
the panel will review changes that can be made to ensure the races ' safety , @entity27 said			2
the september 15 , 2011 , crash came when noted pilot @entity73 's @entity1 flew off course , pitching upward briefly before flying into a spectator area			1
leeward and 10 spectators died , and about 60 people were injured			1
the @entity65 is investigating the cause of the crash and is examining video that shows a piece of trim tab , an aerodynamic surface on the tail of the plane , separating from the plane at the time the pilot lost control			1
the crash also has prompted the @entity65 to hold a one - day hearing on air show safety			1
that hearing will be held tuesday in @entity92			0
@entity27 said the race sponsors , vendors and pilots he has met have " universally " expressed support for continuing the races , and that fan support has been " overwhelming			0
" fewer then 20 % of the fans asked for refunds from the races canceled after last year 's crash , he said			1
@entity27 said the association needs permits or waivers from the @entity67 , the local airport authority and the city of @entity4			0
he expressed optimism that all three entities would permit the races , but said his biggest concern is any unknown obstacle that could interfere with race plans			0
the crash is expected to bring a flurry of lawsuits			0
in a lawsuit filed by the family of deceased spectator @entity120 of @entity121 , @entity122 , lawyers argued the crash was not a " freak accident , " but was " the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk - taking pilot and crew , coupled with an insatiable drive for profit " by race organizers			0
the @entity67 said it has revised its air race policy to require all air racing organizations to go through a standardized accreditation process to ensure all air race organizations are subjected to the same review and authorization standards			0
the @entity67 said it has invited the @entity15 to contact it when it is ready to begin the accreditation process			0
once the @entity67 receives that notification , the @entity67 will select a team that will conduct a top - to - bottom review of the organization 's operations , the agency said			0
in the 49 years of racing at @entity4 , 19 pilots have died in crashes			2
last year 's crash is believed to be the first to kill spectators .			1
