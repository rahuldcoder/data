-- " @entity1 : @entity4 " is , in a way , a tough game to figure out			1
on one hand , the " @entity1 " franchise has provided many hours of enjoyment for fans for 25 years , while chronicling the adventures of everyone 's favorite green - hat - wearing elf , link			1
on the other hand , i was looking for something that was going to advance the franchise in new directions and possibly break some new ground			1
" @entity4 " is full of what we 've come to know and love about @entity13			1
maze - like terrain , challenging dungeons , familiar weapons and , of course , the quest to find @entity1			1
there is little here that we have n't seen before			2
@entity33 , @entity13 's trusted horse , has been replaced by a giant bird that carries him to distant locations			2
unfortunately , there is n't much challenging or exciting about riding around on a flying bird after you 've done it once or twice			2
( but , since @entity13 is based this time out on a city floating in the sky , trying to ride a horse around could have gotten messy very quickly , i suppose			2
) i was also confused about where this game falls in the " @entity1 " timeline			1
link appears to be slightly older , but he does n't have any of his traditional garb or weapons			1
he is a recruit in the knights ' program and , in fact , has to earn his familiar hat and clothing			2
contrast that with previous games where @entity13 looks like a kid			0
unfortunately , @entity13 also seems to be missing his personality			0
he is , as always , silent , but really shows no reaction to anything that happens around him			0
in an early segment , @entity13 is getting bullied but shows no outward emotions			0
it is @entity1 who arrives to chastise the bullies and defend him			1
@entity71 has said " @entity4 " lays the foundation for the events in " @entity1 : @entity76 , " but it does n't feel like a precursor at all			1
the gameplay is slow , with plenty of moments of inaction			0
its pace is almost leisurely as @entity13 goes from one mission or dungeon to the next			0
there 's no sense of urgency , but that does allow players to fully explore without feeling as if they 're missing something			2
environments are vibrant , with collectibles and creatures lurking around every corner			0
there is a maze - like quality when you 're trying to reach some areas -- with only one path in and one path out			0
usually , some puzzle needs to be solved to open the pathway and allow link to continue			2
instead of @entity113 ( " hey , listen ! " ) , a mystical creature named @entity107 acts as sort of an artificial - intelligence program , helping out whenever something new comes up or if a player gets stuck deciding what to do next			0
@entity107 lives in the handle of @entity13 's sword and comes out when summoned			2
she can also evaluate your gameplay and scan the surrounding area for any dangers or monsters			0
combat is decidedly different , since the game requires you to use @entity71 's @entity124			1
defeating monsters , or solving some puzzles , requires precise motions to get past obstacles or slice open new pathways			0
this was a welcome change from straight button - pushing and injected a new level of challenge into combat			0
the nunchucks attached to the @entity137 act as your shield during combat and also help with special moves such as rolling or shield - bashing your enemies			0
the two controllers together work very well and made the combat enjoyable without making it tiring			0
in the end , " @entity1 : @entity4 " is an underwhelming game that mostly sticks to the successful path that @entity13 has been on for the past 25 years			1
this is one series that can keep fans happy with its familiar concepts and characters			0
but the new game 's minor tweaks do n't inject new energy into the franchise			1
i wonder where @entity71 can take " @entity1 " next without considering some radical changes			1
" @entity1 : @entity4 " is available now in @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			1
it is a @entity124 exclusive title and is rated @entity164 + for everyone 10 years old and older due to animated blood , comic mischief and fantasy violence			1
this review was done with a review copy of the game .			0

" *legend* of zelda : @entity4 " does n't offer much that 's new
link the elf seems *emotionless* and the story 's timeline is *unclear*
@entity124 controls offer some fun new challenges
" @entity1 " has provided 25 years of joy , but the franchise needs some changes
