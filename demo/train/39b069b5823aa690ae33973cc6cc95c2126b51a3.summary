after some of the world 's biggest corporations such as @entity3 and @entity4 have come under pressure over aggressive tax avoidance strategies , now its @entity8 's turn to defend its lucrative financial arrangements with 2014 @entity10 hosts @entity11			1
the relationship of football 's world governing body with @entity11 is under scrutiny following the protests that have gripped the country as the @entity20 country stages june 's @entity21 -- a test run for the main event next year			1
initially disgruntlement of the protesters centered on a 20 centavos ( 10 cents ) rise in bus and train fares			0
but a violent response from the police , prompted @entity11 of all ages took to the streets			2
suddenly the issue was about corruption , poor public services , increasing inflation , lack of security and whether the money being spent on the @entity10 might be better invested elsewhere			2
with a subtext of the rich lining their pockets , while the poor pay more to use crumbling public services , the @entity11 government was left scrambling to deal with what some have dubbed the " @entity45			2
" @entity8 president @entity46 , for one , was askance at the protests			2
" i can understand that people are not happy , but they should not use football to make their demands heard , " @entity46 told @entity11 's @entity48			1
tax exemptions while @entity8 argues that @entity11 , as well as @entity53 and @entity54 in 2018 and 2022 , will gain benefits from infrastructure development and tourism as well as the kudos of staging a global sporting event , the @entity10 is key for the world governing body -- the event is its major source of revenue			1
" the exact number i do not know but around $ 4 billion , " said @entity8 secretary general @entity65 earlier in june , referring to what the @entity66 will generate financially for the @entity69 - based organization			1
however , that is a conservative estimate with consultants suggesting the amount could reach $ 5 billion			0
" of course it 's not all profit , it is commercial revenue related to the cycle of not just the @entity10 , but the cycle between the @entity80 and 2014 , " added @entity65			0
three years ago the @entity10 in @entity81 raised $ 3.6 billion , incurring expenditures of $ 1.298 billion			0
for its latest results , @entity8 reported a profit of $ 89 million for 2012 , with reserves of $ 1.378 billion			2
the organization had a revenue of $ 1.166 billion last year and spending of $ 1.077 billion			0
as a not - for - profit association in @entity69 law , @entity8 pays no tax on commercial income from the @entity10			1
but some critics question whether the relationship between @entity8 and its @entity10 hosts is mutually beneficial , notably with regard to the lucrative tax exemptions @entity10 organizers are prepared to offer for the right to stage the biggest single - event sporting competition in the world			1
according to @entity11 's @entity102 the tax exemptions will cost $ 248.7 million , though other reports estimate the figure could be as twice as high for the period between 2011 and 2015			1
the @entity106 will receive similar exemptions when the @entity20 country hosts the @entity109 in 2016			2
proponents argue hosting the @entity10 brings billions more dollars into the @entity11 economy , but $ 250 million buys a lot of bus tickets			0
@entity11 in " @entity8 's hands " ex-brazilian star @entity115 -- now a @entity11 politician -- is one that argues that the money spent on building stadiums would be better spent on constructing houses and schools			1
" @entity8 will make a profit of four billion reais ( $ 1.8 billion ) which should provide one billion ( $ 450 million ) in tax , but they will not pay anything , " @entity115 said in a video posted on the websites of several @entity11 newspapers			1
" they come , set up the circus , they do n't spend anything and they take everything with them			0
" the real president of our country is @entity8 , " added @entity115			1
" @entity8 comes to our country and sets up a state within a state			1
" another critic -- academic and journalist @entity141 , who lives in @entity142 -- believes that @entity8 's much vaunted " @entity144 " slogan should not just apply to on - field behavior			0
" @entity8 should be obliged to follow the pre-existing tax laws in the host countries that apply to international sports non-governmental organizations and their corporate partners , " said @entity141			1
" we saw a response in the lead up to @entity152 that the @entity153 were revolted that the @entity106 's partners were not going to pay taxes			0
" a boycott ensued and the companies agreed to pay taxes on their @entity109 related profits			0
" there are , of course , always government subsidies to attract businesses , but legislative elements like the @entity164 of the @entity10 in @entity11 go far beyond this and effectively redirect public money into @entity69 bank accounts			1
" that analysis drew a swift response from football 's world governing body			0
" @entity8 obtains none of its revenue from public funds of the host country , " a @entity8 spokesman told @entity172			1
" the host country provide the general infrastructure for the event , which remains as a legacy in the country such as transportation , it , upgrades on airports			0
" therefore , it is not true that money is generated in the host country for @entity8 and that it will go then to accounts in @entity69			1
" but the exemptions @entity8 insist upon , has surprised one leading @entity193 taxation expert , professor of @entity194 , who is based in @entity195			1
in bidding for the 2018 @entity10 , @entity53 was up against three other bidders -- @entity197 , @entity199 - @entity198 and @entity201 - @entity200			0
" in that bid book model of the @entity8 as commercial organization , it claimed a privilege of 100 % tax freedom ( no corporate tax , no income tax , no vat , no excise duties , no local tax , not any other taxes ) , irrespective of regular national tax law , @entity193 tax law and international tax law , " said @entity202 after examining the @entity199 part of the bid			1
" i was ( and still am ) not aware of any other international commercial sport event being subsidized through full tax exemption at the cost of ( other ) taxpayers , and did not see any justification for such unequal treatment of @entity8			2
" economic benefits @entity8 insisted that tax exemptions needed to be viewed in relation to the overall economic benefits that next year 's @entity10 potentially might bring @entity11			1
the world governing body quoted a study by @entity232 that estimated that the event would inject r $ 112.8 billion ( $ 50 billion ) into the @entity11 economy by 2014 , with r $ 28 billion ( 12.4 billion ) spent on infrastructure , generating r $ 63.5 billion ( $ 28 billion ) in income for the population			2
" it is important to note that tax exemptions are only related to certain areas of the organization , in particular for temporary use of goods and services during the event , " @entity8 told @entity172			1
" examples include it equipment for broadcasters as well as other material mainly broadcasters and participating teams bring with them , the cars used for the official transport , uniforms for volunteers			0
" amongst others the prize money of the @entity10 is taxable in @entity11			2
" " overall , according to the @entity232 study it is estimated that the host country will obtain an additional tax revenue of r $ 18.1 billion ( $ 8 billion )			0
" it should be noted that @entity8 also bears the costs related to hosting and staging of the @entity10 , including and not limited to the costs of the @entity264			0
this means over $ 1.3 billion in costs for @entity8			0
" cynicism however , in much the same way that the @entity270 economies attempted to bring coherence to the issue of closing global tax loopholes earlier this month , professor @entity267 called on governments and sporting organizations to adopt a more systematic approach to tax			0
" one of the problems in @entity11 , @entity153 and , indeed , in many countries across the world is that there is no coherent strategy or policy in place regarding taxation and sport , " said @entity267			0
" for example , players in this year 's @entity290 final at @entity291 were given exemption from paying tax on revenues earned from the game			0
" whereas in 2015 , players in the rugby union @entity10 final will not be given the same exemption			0
such a lack of strategy , clarity , consistency and openness creates a climate in which confusion , contradiction and cynicism begin to develop			0
" given the scale of the protests in @entity11 , does the @entity20 country want to renegotiate the tax exemptions ? " holding a @entity10 involves agreements that are signed between the organization and the host country in order to receive the event. , " said the @entity11 @entity312			1
" the @entity10 has always been seen by @entity11 as a major opportunity to spur investments in infrastructure and services and to modernize football management in @entity11			2

questions raised over what @entity11 really gets out of @entity66
should money be spent on football stadiums or health and *education* ?
@entity8 receives tax exemptions from @entity11
@entity115 says : " @entity8 comes to our country and sets up a state within a state "
