@entity0 -- harrowing new details have emerged from the last moments of @entity4 which crashed into the @entity5 in june 2009 , killing all 228 passengers and crew			2
new extracts from the cockpit voice recorder reveal that three seconds before impact , one of the crew exclaimed : " damn it , we 're going to crash , this ca n't be true ! " data from the flight recorders that were recovered after nearly two years on the sea bed previously revealed clues about why the plane crashed on its way to @entity21 from @entity22			1
@entity21 's @entity23 , the @entity23 , has said the crisis began after problems arose with the @entity27 's devices that measure its speed , and disconnection of the autopilot			1
it also said the recorders revealed that the pilots failed to discuss repeated stall warnings			0
but in a new book called " @entity40 " ( pilot error ) by aeronautics expert @entity36 , fresh material from the last two minutes of the flight as captured by the cockpit voice recorder reveals the panic - stricken conversations of the confused pilots			1
the plane plunged 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds but the recording -- as reported in the book -- illustrates that the crew did n't understand why the plane was not responding			1
in one extract , a co-pilot says : " climb , climb , climb			0
" but his colleague answers : " but i 've been pulling back on the stick for a while now			0
" in a computer - generated voice , the plane 's warning system keeps repeating the word " stall ! " the captain warns : " watch out , you are pulling up			0
" a co-pilot replies : " am i pulling up ? " the @entity23 has strongly condemned the disclosure of the transcript , which it says is a violation of @entity63 regulations and shows a lack of respect for the late crew members			1
" any attempt at interpretation at this stage is partial and , as a result , can only fan the flames of the controversies of the last few months , which is harmful to all concerned , " it said in a statement			0
@entity75 has also reacted to what it calls " sensationalized and unverifiable information , " which it says " impairs the memory of the crew and passengers who lost their lives			1
" @entity1 's aviation correspondent @entity83 says the material gives a " dramatic insight into what was happening " but adds that it does n't add anything new to the ongoing investigation			0
he also says the inquiry poses questions about how difficult modern airliners are to fly in extreme situations			0
the @entity75 statement says further work is necessary on what it calls the " delicate issue of human - machine interface			2
" the @entity23 has already issued 10 new safety recommendations , including ensuring extra training for pilots on manual handling of a high - altitude stall , and says new safety recommendations will be issued in the final report on the accident , due to be published in june next year .			2

the data comes from flight recorders that lay on the sea bed for nearly two years
the book " @entity40 " ( pilot error ) details the last two minutes of flight
the @entity23 and @entity75 have both condemned publication of the transcript
they say it shows a lack of respect for the *victims*
