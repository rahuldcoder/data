@entity0 -- a massive offshore wind farm planned for @entity3 that has generated fierce political and legal controversy has cleared all federal and state regulatory hurdles			1
the @entity7 said wednesday the @entity8 , the first of its kind in the @entity11 , would not interfere with air traffic navigation and could proceed with certain conditions			1
previous agency approvals were challenged in court , including a ruling last year that forced the latest @entity7 safety evaluation			1
a leading opposition group said another legal challenge was possible			2
the @entity21 administration first approved the power generating project , which has now been on the books for more than a decade , in april 2010 despite opposition from residents			1
opponents over the years have included the late sen. @entity27 , a @entity28 of @entity29 whose family compound is in @entity31			0
125 years of wind power critics claim the wind farm with its 130 turbines would threaten wildlife and aesthetics of @entity38			1
some local residents also fear it will drive down property values			2
the administration has pushed a " green energy " agenda nationally as a way to create jobs and lessen @entity11 dependence on oil imports			0
that effort , however , has been sharply criticized by congressional republicans who have said certain high - profile projects are politically driven			0
they also have skewered certain @entity54 programs that extended millions in taxpayer loans and other aid to alternative energy companies or projects that faltered or did not meet expectations			0
the @entity61 - led @entity60 is investigating the political assertions around @entity8 as part of a broader review of " green energy " projects supported by the administration			2
the panel 's chairman , @entity70 's @entity68 , wrote president @entity21 last week saying that @entity72 interest in the @entity29 project is " well known " and that the @entity7 had been under political pressure to approve it			1
candidates spar over energy future a group opposing the project , the @entity79 , also said in a statement to @entity1 that the @entity7 disregarded safety and asserted the decision was politically driven			1
however , the @entity7 said that it restudied the issue and approval was based solely on safety considerations			1
a key condition imposed by regulators will require @entity8 developers to put lights on each of the 440 - foot turbines and use specific paint colors to increase visibility for pilots			0
@entity8 is being built by private developer @entity95 , a @entity29 - based energy company			0
developers estimate the project will create 600 to 1,000 jobs during construction and 150 full time jobs once complete			0
" this @entity7 approval allows @entity8 to move forward and jump - start the new @entity11 industry in offshore wind power that will help light up the @entity106 , " @entity8 spokesman @entity101 told @entity1			2
the @entity79 said it would continue to fight @entity8			0
" no pilot or passenger should allow this politically driven decision to stand			0
this decision can once again be appealed , " the @entity79 said			0
if financing can be finalized and @entity8 is eventually built , the @entity112 's lease will allow it to operate for 25 years , which is the average lifespan of a wind farm .			1
