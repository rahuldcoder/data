-- this has been the first rock & roll decade without revolution , or true revolutionaries , to call its own			1
the @entity5 witnessed nothing less than the birth of the music			1
the @entity9 were rocked by @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , psychedelia and @entity14			2
the @entity15 gave rise to @entity17 , @entity18 , heavy metal , punk and @entity21			1
in comparison , the @entity22 have been the decade of , among other things , synth pop , @entity27 , the compact disc , @entity30 reunion tours , the @entity31 and a lot more heavy metal			1
but if the past ten years have n't exactly been the stuff of revolution , they have been a critical time of re-assessment and reconstruction			2
musicians and audiences alike have struggled to come to terms with rock 's parameters and possibilities , its emotional resonance and often dormant social consciousness			2
@entity0 's @entity48 the following survey of the 100 best albums of the @entity22 , as selected by the editors of @entity0 , shows that the music and the values it stands for have been richer for the struggle			1
punks got older and more articulate in their frustration and rage , while many veteran artists responded to that movement 's challenge with their most vital work in years			2
and rap transformed the face -- and voice -- of popular music			1
the first 10 entries here span the @entity70 's polyglot punk , @entity72 's crossover funkadelica , afro - bop from @entity74 and @entity75 and hymns of innocence and experience by @entity79 and @entity80			2
further down the list , old - timers like @entity14 , the @entity82 and @entity83 hit new highs ; @entity86 and @entity87 kicked out some serious streetwise jams ; @entity90 and @entity89 established new hard - rock beachheads ; and @entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity94 offered definitive statements of postpunk angst			2
the embarrassment of riches on this list is all the more remarkable , since arthritic radio programming , corporate sponsorship and outbursts of racism and sexism in rap and metal have complicated rock 's present and raised fears for its future			2
best - of lists such as this one are by nature subjective			2
but rock in the @entity22 was like that -- lively , varied , contentious and , to some degree , inconclusive			0
looking at the best rock has had to offer in the @entity22 , it 's clear that there 's plenty of life left in the old beast yet			0
the next revolution may be just around the corner			0

@entity70 , " @entity127 " this album could not have come at a more perfect time or from a more appropriate band than the @entity70			0
released stateside in january 1980 , with the decade but a pup and the new year in gear , " @entity127 " was an emergency broadcast from rock 's @entity135 , serving notice that @entity138 was nigh , western society was rotten at the core , and rock & roll needed a good boot in the rear			1
@entity72 , " @entity144 " released in tandem with the film of the same name , " @entity144 " was more than simply a soundtrack , and it stands as @entity72 's most cohesive and accessible album			0
" he envisioned the film as he made the album , " says @entity151 , vice-president of @entity152 , @entity72 's label			0
" he had a vision in his mind of the film a year before he got in front of the cameras , and he wrote the music to that vision			1
@entity79 , " the @entity164 " " the @entity164 " is the rather esoterically titled album he 's referring to -- a title that even the typically solemn @entity168 could joke about			0
500 @entity169 : ' @entity127 ' by the @entity70 4			0
@entity74 , " @entity170 " " @entity170 " may have been a commercial disappointment , but musically , the band 's 1980 album -- which combines funk , disco and @entity177 rhythms -- was years ahead of its time			0
" it got great critical acclaim , and we felt that it kind of took popular music to the next phase , " says @entity179 , " which is what we always wanted to do			1
@entity75 , " @entity188 " the journey to " @entity188 " began with an unlabeled cassette tape that guitarist @entity191 gave to @entity75 , who listened to it incessantly , without knowing what it was , throughout the summer of 1984			0
@entity18 , " born in the @entity195 " " born in the @entity195 " -- the album , the song and the sixteen - month tour -- turned out to be the breakthrough that @entity18 fans had been expecting for a decade			1
the influential @entity202 musician became the world 's biggest rock star -- and a bona fide @entity195 icon , to boot			1
@entity27 , " @entity206 " " @entity206 , " reportedly recorded for $ 750,000 , has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide -- and it still sells			1
it earned @entity27 over 150 gold and platinum awards worldwide and a record seven @entity212			1
@entity214 , " @entity213 " the members of @entity214 incorporated elements of folk and country music into pop that was , by turns , bright and murky			1
theirs was a quasi-traditional yet boundary - breaking sound that served as a blueprint for alternative bands throughout @entity195 for the rest of the decade			1
@entity228 and @entity229 , " @entity227 " " even in the best days of our marriage , @entity228 and i did n't communicate with each other fabulously well , " says @entity229			0
" i think that the reason the music was good was that we tended to save it for work			1
" perhaps that explains why " @entity227 " is both the best and last album @entity228 and @entity229 made together			0
@entity80 , " @entity80 " @entity80 was discovered in 1987 by fellow @entity241 student @entity240			0

he went to see @entity80 perform at a coffeehouse called @entity252			0
" @entity80 walked onstage , and it was like an epiphany , " he says			0
