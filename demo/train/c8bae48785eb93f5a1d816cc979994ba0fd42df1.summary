editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior political analyst for @entity3 , appearing regularly on @entity3 's " @entity4 , " " @entity5 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7 , " as well as special event coverage			1
@entity2 says independent voters generally like @entity11 's approach to the job of president			1
@entity14 ( @entity3 ) -- the giveaway was when they started calling him " @entity18			0
" it was jarring , at first , to hear many in this group of 12 independent voters refer to their new president by his first name			1
but the more they talked , the more it made sense			0
after all , they are seeing a lot of him			0
and they like it -- or at least they like him			0
" there 's a sense of intimacy , or relationship , that was there , " says @entity36 pollster @entity35 , who conducted the focus group in @entity38 , @entity39 , on wednesday night			2
" [ it shows ] how unbelievably powerful his personal presence is			0
... do n't get fooled by numbers alone			2
" so while the president 's poll numbers start to dip , these dozen independents -- including four @entity50 supporters and a lone @entity52 voter -- are giving the president some leeway			1
they feel like they know him , and that he 's " honest , ' as one put it			1
and while they say the country is " broke , " " worried " and " confused , they 're not blaming @entity18			0
if anything , they seem invested in his success			0
way back in the campaign , a central question was whether voters could get comfortable with @entity11 ; now they consider him a regular guy			1
" it 's like if you call your boss by his first name , you identify with him , " explains @entity72 , a 27 - year - old teacher who supported @entity11			1
" he 's more upfront , does a lot of speeches , verbalizes more than we 've ever been used to , " adds @entity77 , a 54 - year - old dental hygienist who voted for @entity11			1
" i like it , he 's showing himself			2
" it 's the upside of a @entity84 communications strategy that has the president out there all the time -- @entity11 as the @entity88 of his own administration			1
while the inside - the - beltway chatter has been that the ubiquitous @entity11 ought to become a little more scarce ( or voters will stop listening ) , these voters are clearly listening			1
" he was able to speak about health care in a way that people can understand , " says @entity93 , 60 , an @entity11 supporter			1
" it 's the first time i 've ever seen a politician able to do that			2
" but there 's a downside to this all - @entity11 - all - the - time tack			1
these voters , at least , worry that @entity11 is trying to do too much , too soon			1
the succession of daily appearances on an assortment of issues -- particularly health care -- has made them anxious			2
" he 's on a mission , " says @entity72			2
" when he gets an idea in his head , he 's going to get it done			2
" @entity115 , a @entity50 voter , agrees			0
" he is determined [ but ] he 's trying to have his hands in everything too much			2
" while change was the buzzword of the campaign , these voters say they did n't expect it -- nor do they want it -- at mach speed			1
in fact , it worries them			0
" why ca n't they take six months to look at these things ? " asks @entity127 , 44 - year - old @entity50 voter			2
pollster @entity35 says there 's a message for the @entity84 here : " i do n't think the president has any idea how people feel about the speed			1
this is like trying to shove a meal down in a minute			0
" there 's also a sense among these voters that @entity11 , as @entity77 put it , " is putting his hands where he does n't belong			1
" case in point : the @entity150 imbroglio			0
" he never really apologized , " says @entity127			0
" but he admitted he stepped into it			0
" he got credit for backtracking with these voters , but they clearly felt he got ahead of himself in the first place			1
while the president gets credit from these voters for listening and talking to @entity162 , they 're unclear about what he really wants			1
he 's the ultimate salesman they like to watch ; they 're just not sure about what , in the end , he 's endorsing			0
" he likes to get everybody else 's opinion , " says @entity93			0
" at the end of the day , he 's got to make the decision			0
" so what 's his spine made of ? right now , they 're not so sure			0
their answers ranged from steel to sand			0
and , along with the rest of us , they 're watching health care , waiting to see him start to draw some lines in the sand			0
