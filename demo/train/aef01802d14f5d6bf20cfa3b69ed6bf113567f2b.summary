even on @entity3 , @entity5 's app that lets users shoot and share six - second videos , the @entity2 is never gon na give you up			1
a @entity10 teen - ager hacked @entity3 on monday , flouting the app 's strict time limit and uploading all 3 minutes , 33 seconds of " @entity13 , " the ' 80s pop hit turned bait - and - switch internet meme			1
" i think i broke @entity3 , " 16 - year - old @entity16 tweeted monday night			1
in his @entity5 bio , @entity16 lists himself as a web developer			1
based on his ability to share the joys of @entity22 with @entity3 's 13 million users , it 's an apt description			1
@entity3 became available for @entity26 's @entity25 operating system on monday			1
@entity16 , who had experience developing for @entity25 , translated the app 's code into a readable format , then tinkered with parts of the program that lets users upload posts			2
in an interview with tech - news site @entity35 , @entity16 declined to say exactly how he bypassed the 6 - second video limit and said he never meant for his prank to go public			1
" honestly , it was just for my friends and the people who follow me on @entity5 and @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity16 said he was quickly messaged by a @entity5 engineer who asked him to take the video down			2
he did , but by then its viral run had begun			0
" sorry , @entity5 / @entity3 engineers , " he wrote			1
" i tried to keep it quiet , but the internet never forgets			0
" @entity5 did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story			0
@entity16 has said he 'll write more about what he did once the exploit is patched			0
he apologized on the site several times to " the engineers whose day i ruined with my stupid messing around			0
" but it sounds like he was being harder on himself than anyone else			0
" @entity3 , you 're a bunch of bullies , " one reader posted on a @entity62 article			2
" your coding was weak and got exploited -- and you are n't thanking this kid for discovering that for you ? ? kid , do n't apologize			0
they should be paying you			0
" what do i think ? " she wrote			0
" i think @entity3 should hire him			0
" @entity1 started in 2007 as an in - joke on the anything - goes pages of 4chan and became an internet phenomenon			1
usually , a user will post a provocative looking link ( web lore says the first was supposedly a preview of the much - anticipated " @entity86 " video game ) that instead -- surprise ! -- takes web surfers to @entity90 's blue - eyed soul hit			2
it has since reached unprecedented heights for web memes			0
@entity90 's video has received 64 million views on his official channel and another 68 million on a version titled " rickroll 'd " that was uploaded in 2007			2
it was briefly the destination of every single @entity102 video during a 2008 april fool 's joke by @entity26 and became an april 1 gag once again thanks to a bipartisan 2011 effort in the @entity107 legislature .			2

16 - year - old developer " @entity1 " @entity5 's @entity3 app
@entity112 posted three - and - a - half - minute video to site that allows only 6 - second clips
he removed the video at @entity5 's *request* , but the @entity2 already took notice
rickrolling is a bait - and - switch joke *spawned* in 2007 on 4chan
