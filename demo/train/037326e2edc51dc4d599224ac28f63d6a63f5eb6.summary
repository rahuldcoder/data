-- " beyond the hedonism of tasting these wines -- and the hedonism of tasting these wines is going to be off the charts -- i think there will be two very important ideas that come out of this , " says wine educator and " @entity13 " author @entity7 as we share a bottle of @entity10 2012 @entity11 over lunch			1
" to see if the vintners themselves believe there is some reason that these wines scored as highly as they did ; and to see if the people enrolled in the event think there is a ribbon going through the wine			1
" is there a commonality that causes a wine to be considered great ? " @entity7 is one of the top wine authorities in the @entity31 -- " @entity13 " has sold 700,000 copies since 2000 -- and we 're two of a privileged few taking part in a 1,000 - point wine tasting event , featuring 10 @entity11 wines that each received a perfect 100 - point score from @entity38 of " the wine advocate			1
" " since @entity38 began , there have been 369 wines in the world that have been given a perfect 100 score			1
" something like 130 of these are in the @entity31 of that 130 , 119 are in @entity46 and of the 119 , 68 are from the @entity11 , " says @entity7			1
located 60 miles northeast of @entity47 , @entity11 is around 30 miles long and ranges from one to five miles wide -- about one - eighth the size of @entity49			1
despite a 6.1 - magnitude earthquake on august 24 that resulted in damage ranging from a few broken glasses to structural damage to some buildings and equipment , 2014 is already looking to be another excellent and abundant vintage			1
september is the most exciting time to visit			0
fruity pickings as wineries gear up for harvest , pickers move through sun - drenched vineyards , hand - dropping fruit to improve the quality of the final crop ; equipment , already cleaned and prepared , stands idle at winery buildings , ready to process the fruit			1
the @entity72 -- organized by the nonprofit , 500 - member @entity70 association from september 7 - 10 -- is arguably the most sensational event taking place this harvest season			1
the experience includes tastings at some of the valley 's most scenic and most celebrated wineries ; home visits with prolific personalities ; wine blending workshops ; farm - to - table dining ; and , the climax , the first public 1,000 - point tasting ever to be held anywhere , as far as @entity7 or @entity89 are aware			1
the vintages selected represent a cross-section of appellations			0
they were chosen exclusively from the 2000s ; vintners rather than winemakers will attend the tasting , ensuring discussion is philosophical rather than chemical			0
the story of each wine -- and the magic of the experience -- are central to the experience			1
when i eat with celebrated vintner @entity106 at @entity108 's @entity107 in the foodie mecca of upscale @entity110 , he has a treat to share -- a bottle of the @entity113 , a limited edition @entity114 auction label , which he cradles in the crook of one elbow			0
" we work with a number of different vineyards around the valley , as well as own our own , so when it comes to premiere we take grapes from three different vineyards , " says @entity119			0
" we call it the @entity128			0
we do not make this wine normally			2
" @entity131 , lot 15 , the label is also hand - initialed by winemaker @entity132			2
" only 240 bottles were made , " he adds , pouring the ruby red liquid into my glass			0
during a pit stop at my lodging for the next three nights -- the stunning , vintner - owned , forest - cocooned @entity142 property in @entity143 -- i have time to appreciate the events of the day and the beauty of my surroundings			1
from lush lowland orchards to lofty terraces overlooking lush green alleys , @entity11 is filled with pretty views			1
real farmland when i join vintner @entity153 at his terra - cotta - colored home within @entity157 's vineyards , he offers me a cup of tea and explains why the aesthetics of the region -- accentuated by @entity11 's organic development and agricultural land trust -- are special			1
" there is real farming here , it 's not @entity166 -- it 's real , " he says			0
" @entity169 started developing , the people starting coming , then @entity11 started something that in the world now is pretty prevalent -- opening the cellars to tourists			1
" @entity174 and @entity175 ... a couple of them started it , and then everybody did it			0
" we embark on an @entity182 tour of the vineyards that produce @entity157 's single blend , crafted to be the perfect expression of the terroir			2
" @entity11 is unique in the world and in @entity31 , particularly			1
the hills , the climate -- we have a great climate , by the way -- and the beauty of the place			0
" located on @entity195 , @entity194 is another vineyard where spectacular views and a feeling of being connected to the landscape are integral to the experience			0
marketing manager @entity194 greets me at the foyer to its cavernous wooden winery pyramid			0
" artist @entity206 crafted a cardboard pyramid in the @entity208 and then engineers figured out how to build it , " she explains , before leading me to a vintage @entity205 truck			0
she revs the engine and we start climbing through the original 1967 terraces to the meadow , a springy carpet of lush grass shaded by breeze - stirred towering trees above vines that sweep down the slope to the lake at the bottom of the valley			2
this will be the setting for a private @entity72 harvest party on the final night of the event			0
" i could go into family - owned , solar - powered , certified organic , but i really want people to feel this place and to come away and realize that they 've been somewhere really special , both because of the stewardship and because of the magic of the property itself , " says @entity194			2
vine tastings looking over the vines , especially in the slight lull before harvest , it 's easy to forget that this is a working farm designed to ensure the grapes have everything they need to produce world - class wines			1
@entity244 ceo @entity243 and vineyard manager @entity245 show me what happens out among the @entity249 vines on a day - to - day basis			2
as early morning sun turns the vines on the slopes to gold , we stop at cabernet sauvignon vines			0
@entity245 hands me a booklet based on @entity259 's study of ampelography so that i can compare a leaf to the blown - up illustration on the page			2
" she says it looks like a monkey face or mask -- see its hole - punched appearance ? " she says , before greeting a team precision - grafting rootstock and bud to produce new sauvignon blanc vines come spring			2
we try the grapes from one vine , then one adjacent , tasting the difference in sweetness in vines before squeezing a berry onto a refractometer for a more precise measurement of the sugars			0
then we cruise up a grassy ridge to where guest experience manager @entity284 -- former wine director at @entity286 - starred @entity285 -- has already laid a table with sky blue linen , five wines and bite - size pairings overlooking the mirror - like lake			1
there was just one more aspect of winemaking to experience -- the blending			0
at @entity305 , after a discussion of the philosophy behind the winemaking process , @entity297 , @entity299 president and winemaker , and owner @entity301 , pose a challenge -- to blend my own version of the @entity301 cabernet from the barrel provided			0
i follow the team into a futuristic - looking barrel room where a red neon art installation reflects off hand - etched trapezoid @entity314 barrels and along the cool corridors to the tasting room			2
" @entity319 will award a prize to the winning blend , " says manager @entity318			0
game on ! @entity72 ; only 24 spots available ; $ 6,000 per person or $ 10,000 per couple ( double occupancy ) ; september 7 - 10 , 2014 @entity326 is a freelance travel journalist based in the @entity31 , the @entity328 and @entity329			1
she was given a preview of this year 's @entity72 .			0
