-- the federal government has instructed @entity4 to scale back its use of oil dispersants in the @entity7 , @entity2 administrator @entity1 said monday			1
@entity8 said she believes @entity4 's total use of dispersants can be reduced by as much as 80 percent			1
while the dispersants are successfully breaking up much of the oil being spilled into the @entity7 , she said , " we are making environmental tradeoffs " and are " deeply concerned " about potential side effects			1
@entity8 and @entity15 rear adm. @entity14 , the federal on - scene coordinator for the oil spill response effort , told reporters that subsea use of dispersants at the source of the leak will continue			1
but the federal government strongly prefers to eliminate oil on the surface through a combination of burning and mechanical skimming , they said			2
the " use of dispersant in the subsea means that you do n't need to spray as much ( on the surface ) , " @entity8 later explained			0
" the idea from the very beginning was that if you could use it in the subsea ... you would n't need to spray as much on top			0
" @entity8 's announcement came less than a week after @entity2 ordered @entity4 to find another chemical dispersant to use on the oil spill after concerns arose about the long - term effects of the substance now being used			1
federal officials have been seeking an alternative to the hundreds of thousands of gallons of @entity46 that have been sprayed on the oil slick since april			0
the product has been rated less effective and more toxic than many others on the list of 18 @entity2 - approved dispersants , according to testimony at a congressional hearing wednesday			1
@entity46 includes petroleum distillates , propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonic salt , and prolonged contact with it can cause eye or skin irritation , according to the manufacturer 's material data safety sheet			0
the document warns that " repeated or prolonged exposure may irritate the respiratory tract			0
" " i was n't satisfied with the answer that we got " from @entity4 regarding possible alternatives , @entity8 said			1
while the data compiled so far does " not show a problem with toxicity " as a result of the use of @entity46 , it " seems to me that a month into this and with no end in sight ... we need to ask ourselves whether there 's a better product out there			0
and @entity4 seemed to spend a lot of time saying why everything else did n't work			2
" the @entity2 is in the process of setting up a series of toxicity tests , @entity8 said , " to look at what 's going on out there now and to look at whether there 's a better choice			2
" asked earlier about the company 's continued use of an oil dispersant in the face of an @entity2 request that it use a less toxic alternative , @entity4 official @entity90 said , " everything that we do with dispersants is with the explicit approval of the @entity2			1
" on monday , coast guard commandant adm. @entity101 -- the @entity103 administration 's point man for the spill -- warned reporters at the @entity106 that the " decision to use dispersants does n't do away with the problem			2
" it simply means " we are willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather than on land			0
it is a trade - off of where the impact of the oil is going to be made			0
