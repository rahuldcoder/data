the debate about inequality just keeps heating up			1
at the end of the year , president @entity3 called it " the defining challenge of our time			1
" @entity10 mayor @entity9 just promised a war for equality			0
democrats across the country are thrilled at the prospect of raising the minimum wage			0
the 50th anniversary of president @entity20 's @entity19 speech seems to have riled everybody up			0
and on tuesday , @entity13 won a small potential victory on behalf of the jobless , squeaking past a procedural hurdle so the @entity25 can proceed with debate on a bill that would extend emergency unemployment benefits for three months			2
but behind the headlines , the story is more complex			2
for one thing , we need to be clear what kind of inequality we care about			2
do we want to close the gap between low and high earners , in which case a higher minimum wage would help ? or is it between the employed and unemployed , where a higher minimum wage is irrelevant or possibly slight harmful -- but where unemployment benefits help a lot ? or is the income inequality we are worried about the one between the poor and the middle class , or the one between the affluent and the really , really affluent -- that is , the top 1 % most important of all , we need to be clearer about whether we are seeking greater equality of outcomes , or greater equality of opportunity			1
@entity3 reminded us that @entity53 has long stood as a nation that promotes equality of rights and opportunities , rather than outcomes			1
there are big gaps in the @entity53 between rich and poor , mostly because the state is a much less enthusiastic redistributor of income than in other nations			1
inequality is a political choice , rather than an economic fact			2
taking money from the successful to help the struggling is close to an un-american idea			0
but as @entity3 noted , @entity53 tolerance of inequality has historically rested upon an assumption of shared opportunity			1
the trouble is , @entity53 is now not very equal in terms of opportunity , either			1
scholars are wrestling with the question of how income inequality and intergenerational mobility are related to each other			1
intuitively , it seems harder to climb a ladder when the rungs are farther apart			0
so inequality may cause immobility , in a relationship popularized by the economist @entity89 as a " @entity90			2
" but it is not a straightforward relationship			0
for one thing , there are some nations with similar rates of inequality to the @entity53 , but much higher rates of mobility , such as @entity100 and @entity101			1
meanwhile , in other nations with low rates of social mobility , such as @entity106 , greater government redistribution softens the blow			1
the children of the poor may end up poor , but their poverty is less biting than in the @entity53			1
and of course there are some countries that are both equal and enjoy mobility , such as those in @entity116			1
inequality and immobility are a toxic combination regardless			2
an unequal , immobile society will mutate into a stratified one with sharply separated classes , generation after generation			0
in his speech , @entity3 stirred low mobility , low wages and high inequality together into a political goulash of " an economy that works for all @entity53			1
" that 's fine for political positioning			0
but when it comes to policy , choices have to be made			0
a higher minimum wage will raise incomes among low - income workers but will do little to reduce inequality , since the poorest do n't work -- and the incomes of the top 1 % , where the real inequality action is , will be unaffected			0
if the goal is to address income inequality seriously , the solution is to tax the richest more and put that revenue into tax credits and welfare benefits			0
doing so will even out incomes but will likely do little to alter the distribution of opportunities			0
if we want to tackle intergenerational mobility , that money would be far better spent on parenting programs , pre-k schemes , higher salaries to lure talented teachers to tough schools , greater subsidies for smart , poor children going to college and tighter regulation of internships			2
none of which will influence short - run income inequality one jot			0
@entity3 's rhetoric leaned more toward boosting social mobility			1
but his policy prescriptions tilted more toward addressing inequality and wage levels			0
which does he really want ? he might of course say both			0
but it 's not realistic to imagine we can become @entity177			0
the real choice is to try and recover the notion of an open society in the @entity181 , currently flourishing in @entity100 , or accept the slow ossification of the class divide and do a better job of compensating the poor for their increasingly inherited poverty			0
if we give up on the hope of improving social mobility , the moral claims of @entity189 - style egalitarianism will become harder to resist			1
a large gap between rich and poor is one thing when there 's plenty of movement between the two , but quite another when affluence and poverty are inherited			1
there is a moral justification for a society with high inequality offset by high mobility , grounded in liberal ideas of freedom and fairness			2
and there is a moral justification for a society with low mobility , softened by low inequality , based on left - of - center egalitarian ideals			2
but there is no moral justification for a society with a large gap between rich and poor , and little movement between the two			1
that 's the toxic combination we 're suffering from right now .			0

@entity223 : inequality debate masks complex issue of inequality *vs.* social mobility
@entity3 says @entity53 tolerated inequality as long as there was equal opportunity
but @entity223 says fixing social mobility involves different strategy than fixing inequality
@entity223 : gap between rich and poor and little movement between the two is toxic
