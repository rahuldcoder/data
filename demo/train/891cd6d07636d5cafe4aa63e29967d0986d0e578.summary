-- the title question posed by the fumbled romantic comedy " @entity3 " is open to more readings than writer - director @entity5 probably had in mind			1
the simplest interpretation is , how do you know when you 're really in love ? that 's the dilemma faced by @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , a 31 - year - old professional athlete at the end of her softball career , who bounces between two men			1
should this compact , upbeat go - getter give her heart to @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , a rich and famous major league baseball player whose vanity is offset by his sunny guilelessness and who offers great sex and good times ? or is she better off with @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , a sweet but anxious businessguy who , as the naïve target of a federal investigation into business shenanigans , is watching his life fall apart ? consider the character types , consider the familiar personas of the actors who play them -- @entity21 the loopy blond operator , @entity28 the cute brunet everyshlub -- and you 've got your answer even before you buy a ticket			1
the deeper meaning of @entity5 's title , meanwhile , is this : how do you know what the right thing to do is , both in the big picture of life and in the moment ? business ethics and family responsibilities challenge @entity27 and his father , @entity53 ( @entity5 regular @entity53 , broadly over-spluttering ) , a hard - charging financial tycoon who also happens to be @entity27 's boss			2
@entity11 needs to devise a new career plan now that her days at bat are over			2
even @entity27 's loyal , very pregnant office assistant ( @entity58 ) wrestles with the ethics of sharing confidential information -- as well as with the terrors of impending single motherhood			0
all this to - ing and fro - ing , this trying and failing on the way to ( excuse the shrink talk ) self - actualization is rich material for an expansive romantic comedy of psychological substance -- the kind , indeed , that @entity5 has made his feature - film specialty , from " @entity71 " and the great " @entity72 to the sour spanglish			2
" but something does n't connect here			0
scenes go flat , punchlines foul out			0
and a sympathetic but frustrated fan of the filmmaker 's stories and characters is entitled to ask , why does n't " @entity3 " know what to do from scene to scene ? the answer , i think , is partly structural and script - driven : the '' funny '' moments are whiffed , the dialogue is '' scene - y , '' and each reaction shot is held a second or ten too long , leaving the actors hanging			1
@entity0 : see all of this week 's reviews but the bigger reason may be because only one character really fascinates @entity5 , and that 's @entity11 the athlete			0
her suitors , in contrast -- especially @entity20 the player , who keeps a closet full of pink loungewear on his shelves for his many visiting ladies -- are more plot - functional than three - dimensional , even when @entity28 gives adorable , well - meaning haplessness his best , @entity108 shot			1
" @entity3 " asks really good questions but does n't so much answer them as toss the ball from player to player until the clock runs out			0
