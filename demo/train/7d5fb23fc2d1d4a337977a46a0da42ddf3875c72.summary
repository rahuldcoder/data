-- her almond - shaped brown eyes shine through her sunken face as a doctor lifts her sweater to reveal a tiny rib cage pushing against her skin			1
little more than a year old , @entity8 wastes away at the @entity9 in the besieged @entity11 suburbs just a few miles from the medical supplies needed to save her			1
slowly , painfully , organs shut down one by one as her muscles atrophy until , barley breathing			1
on january 12 , the toddler 's heart stops			1
the cause of death : hunger			2
starvation is the @entity27 government 's newest and cruelest weapon against opposition neighborhoods leaving infants with swollen heads and distended bodies , their mothers dry of breast milk , and their elders skeletal and dehydrated , according to activists and doctors			1
in one of the earliest cases , 1 - year - old @entity37 arrived at the @entity41 medical center weak and whimpering as doctors struggled to find veins to feed her intravenously			1
" i remember this child very well she was about a year old and she weighed only 4 kilograms , " said dr. @entity44 , who treated @entity45 last november			2
her destitute family fled their village with just the clothes on their back , leaving them with little access to food , @entity44 said			2
" they arrived and put this child between my hands and imagined with a shot or some medicine her strength would come back and the ordeal would be over , " said @entity44 , one of the few pediatricians in the area			2
after just 48 hours , nothing remained of the baby but a skeletal frame with tubes bandaged to a yellowed face frozen in anguish			2
but what appeared at the time a unique horror , now repeats itself over and over in the @entity11 suburbs , doctors and activists told @entity0			1
parents often risk death by sniper fire , simply to forage for nutrition			2
a nurse , who did not wish to be identified for fear of reprisal , in the besieged @entity83 on the outskirts of @entity11 told @entity85 that around four people a day arrive with gunshot wounds from snipers targeting civilians as they pick plants and shrubs from nearby fields			1
established in 1957 , @entity83 , an unofficial refugee camp , has been home for decades to thousands of @entity94 displaced by @entity97 - @entity96 wars			2
at @entity99 of @entity11 , near @entity83 , 43 people have died of starvation , 22 of them children , the youngest just 23 days old , with most of the deaths occurring this past month , a dramatic increase , according to hospital staff			1
" sometimes i get a case due to malnutrition or lack of medicine and , i feel utter desperation because i can not help the child			2
we have reached a state where this is normal -- that every two to three days a child dies			2
it just feels like there is no nutrition			2
what can we do ? " said a doctor at the hospital who did not wish to be identified out of fear of @entity27 forces			1
parents sometimes crumble in the face of despair and very few options			2
" i had a 2 - year - old patient just a few days ago , and she was diagnosed with a life threatening condition and when her father found out he said ' ok			0
i will take her home to die			0
' just like that -- without hesitation			0
he said ' what am i to do ? there is no food and no medicine , ' " the doctor said			0
" the first 1000 days of life , from conception to 2 years are absolutely critical as far as nutrition and the developmental foundations of life are concerned			0
if the child in the womb of a pregnant mother , and the mother is n't getting the food she needs and there is this obstacle in the way of getting access to this kind of vital nutrients they need to grow			0
they are not going to recover			0
that is a real tragedy , " said @entity160 a spokesman for the @entity162			0
in a video widely viewed on @entity166 of a skeletal 10 - year - old named @entity167 in the eastern @entity170 town of @entity171 , a distraught man who @entity0 has confirmed is a relative of the child shouts : " is this acceptable to @entity175 ? look at this child			0
is this acceptable to world ? does the look like a human body ? is this the arm of a child ? he is just 10 years old			0
" @entity182 an activist in @entity171 told @entity0 that residents fear @entity167 and dozens of others may soon die of hunger			0
@entity182 shared with @entity0 the case of 8 - month - old @entity188 from the same town who recently died from lack of infant milk and proper medical care			0
shocking online video of @entity188 's lifeless body bore the hallmarks of starvation such as a swollen abdomen and protruding ribs , doctors said			1
the cause of crisis is clear			0
the once thriving agriculture belt to the east of the capital and the collection of towns and neighborhoods to the south wilted under a government siege blocking food staples from those areas			1
opposition - controlled farmland lies desolate after nearly two years of warfare that has destroyed crops and livestock , leaving little more than stores of grain for thousands trapped behind government tanks			1
many say the blockades are used by the @entity27 government as collective punishment against opposition areas			1
hostilities make it difficult to gain a clear view of the scope and scale of malnutrition in the area , but the @entity162 estimates at least 800,000 civilians remain under siege			0
" this underlines exactly why humanitarian agencies like the @entity162 have been calling for more access			0
to really see with their eyes : what is the scale of the problem ? who is most vulnerable ? what kind of assistance do they need ? and how can we get it in fast ? that is absolutely critical , " @entity160 said			1
@entity85 has been more direct : " the @entity27 government is cruelly punishing civilians living in opposition - held areas			1
starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime			1
the blockades must be lifted immediately and access to humanitarian aid must never be used to score military or political gains , " said @entity258 , @entity85 's @entity259 and @entity261 director			0
@entity27 officials failed to respond to @entity0 requests for comment on this story , but have said in general terms that " foreign - backed terrorists " catapulted the country into a spiral of violence that has triggered @entity27 army efforts to expel opposition fighters from the @entity11 suburbs			1
perhaps most disturbingly , packed aid convoys ready and willing to deliver assistance to those in need are barred from doing so -- mainly by @entity27 government troops			1
" the road to political stability and confidence building in @entity27 starts with an important step : ensuring no one dies because of a lack of food or medicine or from the cold when humanitarian workers are nearby but are not allowed in " said @entity291 , @entity162 's executive director			1
@entity294 peace talks secured an agreement for some aid to enter the @entity83 this week , but several hundred food parcels and limited medical evacuations are simply not enough to stave off malnutrition			0
" to make any progress in addressing these needs , @entity304 's presence and humanitarian assistance work must be permitted to continue and expand over a period of months , not days , " @entity300 , spokesman for the @entity301 said in a statement			0
" if the siege does not end , i expect even i will be dead , " @entity309 said over a crackly @entity311 connection			0
" if the siege is not broken these cases will increase and there will be mass death			0
to be honest this is what i would expect : mass death			0

many are starving in suburbs south of @entity11 , @entity27
infants are particularly vulnerable , doctors say
many say @entity27 government is *purposely* starving opposition areas
