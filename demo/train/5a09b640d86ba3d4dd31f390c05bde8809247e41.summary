-- reading the legal complaint leaves a heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach			2
the claim , filed by attorney @entity7 on behalf of one child , alleges 4 - and 5 - year - olds at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , were performing oral sex on each other at the preschool			1
the suit alleges that in addition to acts performed on the 5 - year - old plaintiff , other students were removing their clothing and engaging in sexual acts on the playground and during nap time			1
such behavior , experts say , would be rooted in normal childhood development ; the children participating in or seeing such sexual acts may not fully understand what is taking place			1
whether such alleged inappropriate acts will have a long - term impact on students depends on how the situation is handled , experts say			1
" young children are not developmentally prepared to engage in sex , " said @entity37 , an expert in youth violence and sexual behavior			1
" their brains are not ready to absorb that kind of information			2
" @entity7 told @entity0 he is representing six children who attended the church 's program and their parents			1
he plans to file five additional lawsuits before the end of february			0
the first , filed tuesday , names the school , several of the @entity53 of @entity11 's leaders , an unnamed " minor perpetrator " and the perpetrator 's parents as defendants			1
the suit said that the @entity61 @entity60 conducted an evaluation of the center in november and found a lack of supervision , which " allowed for inappropriate touching between minor students			0
" in a statement , @entity10 officials said the incident referenced in the lawsuit happened in october and was " addressed and dealt with " at that time			0
the statement notes that the plaintiff was still enrolled in the church 's preschool until last week			1
kids at risk : say something or bite your tongue ? @entity80 , spokesman for the @entity81 , told @entity0 the department met with officials from the church on february 1 concerning " noncompliance " license violations against the school over the past six months			1
the violations discussed included a lack of supervision at the care facility , child - teacher ratios and inappropriate discipline			0
at that meeting , @entity80 said , the department was informed that the school 's director was resigning and the school license would be set to inactive on friday			1
the decision to close the school was made based on the director 's resignation , which was for personal reasons and not related to the incidents , according to the church officials ' statement			1
on wednesday , the @entity81 issued a temporary suspension order to the development center after determining there was an " immediate risk to the children in care			1
" the order prohibits the facility from operating , according to a letter from the department			0
@entity80 said the department will continue to investigate after the school closes			0
questions remain , @entity37 said , about what exactly happened at the school : was this a group of unsupervised children just being curious about their bodies ? were they copying something they had seen on tv or in a magazine at home ? was it the result of sexual abuse -- either by another student or an adult ? @entity137 , an expert in human developmental stages at @entity139 , said sexuality , in a sense , starts younger than you might think			1
between the ages of 2 and 5 , children learn to dress and undress themselves and begin to understand what it means to be a boy versus a girl			1
many toddlers like to run around naked , @entity137 said , and may touch themselves			0
" that is again , very normal			0
... they 're simply doing things that feel good , in the same way they might curl their hair , " she said			0
" they do n't ( know ) social norms			0
they have n't learned what 's polite and impolite until parents teach them			1
" children are excellent imitators , @entity137 said			1
often the actions they 're exhibiting have been copied from somewhere else			0
adults who come across children exploring their bodies in inappropriate ways should step in immediately and stop the behavior , she suggested			1
they should explain that the acts are not acceptable in public areas			0
parents should teach their kids about " private parts " that need to be covered in public , she said , and about personal space			1
the way parents deal with the alleged situation in @entity12 will affect how much of a long - term impact it may have on the children , @entity37 said			1
getting upset or angry may convey to a child that he is in trouble and lead to anxiety surrounding his sexuality down the road			0
instead , asking questions calmly about what happened and why should clear up whether the child has been traumatized by events			0
a professional therapist can help determine the extent of trauma and work with the family to recover , @entity37 said			0
even if the child does n't know sexual activity is wrong , it can still have lingering effects			0
while some exploration is natural , sexual acts such as oral sex may " make them feel odd or funny or sad or angry , " she said			1
" it 's those emotions that have to be cared for			2
" the best way to avoid these kinds of situations is to have ongoing conversations about sexual behaviors with your kids , @entity137 said			2
" it 's important for parents to realize you do n't have ' the talk ' and you 're done			2
" when children are around 2 , parents can discuss body parts and the differences between boys and girls , she said			2
as children grow a bit older , parents can talk about private parts and when it 's ok ( and not ok ) for kids to explore their bodies			1
in later years , kids will ask where babies come from ; you do n't have to talk about birth control and abortion , but you should answer their questions simply and directly , @entity137 said			2
" ( @entity247 ) is very different than drugs and smoking -- you do n't ever want them to do that , " @entity137 said			0
" being a sexual being is who we are			0
" there are warning signs that your child is participating in inappropriate behavior or is being abused , @entity37 said			0
every day , parents should be talking to their children about their day : what happened , who they hung out with , what they did			2
if topics come up the child should have no knowledge about , calmly ask more questions , she suggested			0
other signs include drastic changes in behavior , trouble sleeping , eating changes or anger issues , @entity37 said			0
" we want people to be aware so if they 're in this situation they know what to do , " she said			0
" even if it is something that 's unfortunate that 's happened to your child , there is help out there			2
" @entity0 's @entity282 and @entity283 contributed to this report .			2
