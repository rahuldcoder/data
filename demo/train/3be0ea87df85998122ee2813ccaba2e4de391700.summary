-- all this excitement over recent @entity3 public diplomacy on @entity4 is a bit odd to those of us who have been following that diplomacy strategy for over a decade			2
that @entity9 chose to write an op - ed in the @entity11 this week is not at all shocking			1
it is part of a broader pattern of @entity3 outreach that began in 2001			2
what confuses people about @entity3 public diplomacy is that it often veers from a closed fist approach to an open handshake depending on its narrow objective -- all the while testing @entity24 as it seeks to build its own popularity around the world			1
since the end of the 1990s the @entity3 have been aware that @entity24 and other nations see a weakened former @entity30 empire behaving badly in the world , and they have sought to correct that perception beginning with the hiring of an @entity24 public relations firm back in 2006 , which generated interest at the time			1
for years the @entity3 have worried about how they are portrayed in @entity24 media , about @entity38 's depiction of @entity3 as mobsters and thugs , for example			1
scholars of @entity3 have written often about @entity3 's near - obsession with its place in the world , including a fixation on polls -- like @entity47 's -- about @entity3 's popularity with the outside world			1
over the years , @entity3 officials have looked for opportunities in the media to portray @entity3 as helpful and constructive -- even when it was not			0
they attempted to use @entity3 television , and later the @entity54 , to brandish a better image in the @entity56 -- creating a news agency , @entity57 ( @entity57 ) which operates 80 news bureaus around the world and @entity59 which boasts a following of 630 million people in over 100 countries			0
the @entity3 are also fans of inserting newspaper supplements of @entity59 in @entity24 newspapers just to remind readers of their relevance			1
@entity3 remains relevant but its image in the world has suffered throughout the last decade , for good reason			0
think of some of the recent events : the conflict @entity3 had in 2008 with its southern neighbor , @entity77 , over the disputed territory of @entity79			0
then there was the feud with @entity82 in 2009 which resulted in @entity3 cutting off gas to @entity82			0
there was a series of international corruption scandals around a @entity3 oil firm , @entity87 , including accounting charges involving @entity24 financial firms			1
one can not , of course , forget the @entity93 case which emanated from the arrest , and subsequent death in custody of a @entity3 lawyer who became a whistle - blower about human rights			2
that case led to a feud with the @entity24 , congressional sanctions , and the release of a list in april of @entity3 individuals not allowed into @entity24			1
add to that the @entity3 imprisonment of a feminist punk rock group -- @entity108 -- for daring to protest against the @entity3 government			0
oh , and let 's not forget @entity3 's hosting of @entity113 leaker @entity112			0
@entity3 often finds itself in the odd situation of doing negative things and trying to get positive press			1
it cracks down on dissidents one day but then bids for the @entity119 the next			0
it woos the @entity24 and then bashes it			0
and then its leader writes an op - ed. writing op - eds in @entity24 newspapers is not new for the @entity3			1
a good example comes from three years ago			0
in march 2009 , on the eve of a @entity127 meeting with president @entity128 , @entity3 president @entity124 wrote an op - ed in the @entity130 , telegraphing a new @entity24 - @entity3 relationship based on the concept of mutual interests			1
he cleverly invoked the writing of the @entity136 philosopher , @entity135 , author of " @entity137			0
" in the op - ed the @entity3 president predicted " a great future for our two nations , " adding that " so far , each country has tried to prove the truth of those words to itself and the world by acting on its own			1
i firmly believe that at this turn of history , we should work together			0
" what is worth remembering is that the @entity3 do n't mind twists and " turns of history " -- and they do n't mind a bit of confusion about whether or not they are good guys or bad			1
this op - ed in the @entity11 has generated both outrage and curiosity -- with some predictable criticism by the @entity162 crowd on @entity163 , who believe @entity24 will be duped			1
for @entity24 , there is something emotional about @entity3			2
it inevitably evokes fear and fascination in the @entity24 and the @entity56 perhaps because of its long and complex history , its culture , and memories of @entity173 days when so much time , effort and money was spent defending ourselves against the @entity30			2
@entity3 's latest attempt to win hearts and minds is intriguing and is likely to be effective if the result is some kind of interim deal over chemical weapons			0
a positive step by @entity4 , at the urging of @entity187 , to acknowledge its chemical stockpiles and surrender even a portion of them would be a good development -- and @entity3 will claim credit for saving the day			2
if the diplomacy fails , and the @entity24 decides to strike @entity4 , @entity3 will lay the blame for any damage on @entity24			2
so either way , the gamble makes sense from @entity9 's view			0
as for the @entity24 , we have no choice but to take @entity3 up on the offer to press the @entity4 to relinquish control over the weapons			1
@entity24 like peaceful solutions and we certainly should test the proposition with @entity3			2
but while we are diplomatically dueling with @entity3 , we must remain mindful of their public diplomacy strategies , watch closely as they maneuver and , in the end , do what is in our own national security interest			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			0

@entity213 : @entity9 op - ed not *surprising* : @entity3 has long tried to build its popularity
@entity9 attentive to polls on views of @entity3 , tries to stem *persistent* negative portrayals , she says
she says oddly , @entity3 keeps doing negative things and trying to get positive press
@entity213 : @entity226 has provoked many ; @entity3 does n't mind ; @entity9 *enjoys* *tweaking* @entity24
