-- why is the @entity1 the most famous painting in the world ? her enigmatic smile ? the mystery surrounding her identity ? the fact she was painted by @entity10 pin - up boy @entity9 ? sure , all of these things helped boost the popularity of the 16th century masterpiece			1
but what really catapulted the small , unassuming portrait to international stardom was a daring burglary over 100 years ago			1
when @entity21 handyman @entity20 stole the @entity1 from the @entity22 in 1911 , he never could have guessed her absence would be the very thing that made her the most recognizable painting on the planet			1
suddenly images of the artwork were splashed across international newspapers , as the two - year police hunt hit dead - end after dead - end			1
it was n't until december 1913 -- exactly 100 years ago next month -- that @entity33 was finally caught and the @entity1 recovered , becoming the best known painting in a time before we shared images on tv , internet , and phones			1
today , she is the jewel in the @entity22 's crown , helping attract over 9.7 million visitors to the @entity44 museum last year , and immortalized in everything from @entity47 's pop art to @entity49 's bestselling novel , " the @entity48			1
" but had @entity33 instead slipped another artwork under his cloak that fateful day , it could have been a very different story			2
" if a different one of @entity9 's works had been stolen , then that would have been the most famous work in the world -- not the @entity1 , " said @entity54 , professor of art history and author of " the thefts of the @entity1			1
" " there was nothing that really distinguished it per se , other than it was a very good work by a very famous artist -- that 's until it was stolen , " he added			1
" the theft is what really skyrocketed its appeal and made it a household name			0
" bold burglar so how did @entity33 pull off one of the greatest art heists of all time ? with mind - boggling ease , it seems			0
the handyman had been hired by the @entity22 to make protective glass cases for some its famous works -- including the @entity1			1
after hiding in a closet overnight , he simply removed the painting , hid it under his smock , and was about to waltz out of the building when he discovered the door was locked			0
@entity86 removed the doorknob , but still it would n't open -- until a helpful plumber passing by opened the door with his key			0
it was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the @entity1 was missing , with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned			1
" the @entity22 had over 400 rooms but only 200 guards and even fewer on duty overnight , " said @entity54 , founder of the @entity95 ( @entity95 )			1
" there were basically no alarms in play			0
" " it was under - secure			0
but to be fair , most museums were at that time			0
" front page news the @entity107 press had a field day , seeing it as an opportunity to poke fun at the seemingly inept government which ran the @entity22			1
this was an era where newspapers were really taking off , and pretty soon the theft -- and the image of the @entity1 -- was splashed across the world			1
" 60 detectives seek stolen @entity1 , @entity107 public indignant , " reported the @entity118			2
for the first time there were queues outside the @entity22 , just to see the empty space where the painting had hung			1
" the theft launched it into becoming a household name for people who had never been to @entity129 and had no interest in art , " said @entity54 , adding : " and it 's really just continued from there			2
" over the next two years , the bungling police investigation dragged on , with @entity134 a suspect at one point			0
the force even interviewed @entity20 twice , before concluding he could n't possibly be the man behind the brazen burglary			0
discovery the head of the @entity44 police retired in shame			0
and then two years later , an art dealer in @entity145 received a letter from a man saying he had the @entity1			1
it was signed " @entity9			2
" the man was of course @entity33			0
after setting up a meeting with the dealer and the director of the uffizi gallery in @entity145 , @entity20 turned up with the painting which had spent years hidden in a trunk in his apartment			2
@entity20 , then 32 years old , claimed to have stolen the artwork to return her to her native @entity21			2
he was arrested and eventually sentenced to seven months jail			0
" he seemed to have genuinely been convinced he would be heralded as a national hero and genuinely dismayed to discover he was n't , " said @entity54 , adding : " he was maybe a few pickles short of a sandwich , but not a lunatic			0
" for most of us , the @entity1 will only ever be seen from behind bullet - proof glass , a thumbnail in the distance , smiling her knowing - smile behind jostling tourists with camera phones held aloft			2
but for over two years @entity33 had the famous woman all to himself			2
did he fall in love with her ? " i think so , " said @entity54			0
" there are a number of thieves who have stolen art and have suffered a sort of ' reverse @entity182 ' -- where the hostage - taker falls in love with the hostage			0
" " in this case , the hostage was a work of art. " stove ashes probed for traces of stolen @entity134 , @entity192 , @entity193 works			0
