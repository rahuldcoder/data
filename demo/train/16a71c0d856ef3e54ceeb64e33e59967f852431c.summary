here 's a thought that might make even the most conscientious e-mail user nervous : " when the @entity3 director can not hide his activities online , what hope is there for the rest of us ? " the @entity9 posed this question in a recent blog post			1
the group , of course , was referring to the scandal involving @entity15 , who resigned as head of the spy agency after the @entity18 uncovered e-mails indicating he was having an affair with his biographer , @entity21			1
the story has gotten lots of media attention , in part for its soap - operatic qualities			2
@entity27 discussed , however , at least outside the technology press , is what this e-mail - based investigation says about privacy and surveillance in the digital age			1
here 's a quick look at some of the more surprising issues : e-mail -- even anonymous e-mail -- is not as secure as you think : e-mails do n't just carry a subject line and whatever you type into them			2
these digital missives also tote along with them packets of information called " metadata " or " headers , " which may contain information about where the message was sent from			1
that can help investigators corroborate who sent an e-mail , even if it comes from an anonymous account			2
" in the case of @entity60 that includes the ip address of the connection used to send an email , so investigators do n't need to subpoena a mail provider to trace its origin , " @entity57 writes for the @entity58			2
@entity68 writer @entity67 summarizes the situation this way : " in these days of constant communication by mobile and desktop , it 's almost impossible to leave zero trace of a digital footprint , even if you do send e-mails through an anonymous account			1
" communicating by saving e-mail drafts on a joint account is old hat : some reports indicate @entity15 tried to communicate with his mistress by setting up a joint e-mail account with her and then saving messages in the account 's draft folder			1
so , essentially , they may have been e-mailing each other without actually sending an e-mail			2
that sounds smart , right ? very @entity92			0
) but the technique has become so dated that it 's no longer much of a cover			0
" if we know that kind of subterfuge is being used by terrorists , " writes @entity96 for @entity97 , " then it 's almost axiomatically an inadequate counter-surveillance option			0
" the @entity9 's @entity103 writes that saving e-mails in draft form instead of sending them may , paradoxically , make it easier for investigators to access the messages			1
@entity111 digital privacy law was written before e-mail was popular : here 's a doozy			1
the privacy law that governs digital communications was last updated in 1986 , or , as the @entity9 puts it , when " there was no @entity117 , nobody carried a cell phone , and the only ' social networking ' two - year - old @entity121 ( now the ceo of @entity122 ) was doing was at pre-school or on play dates			1
" the law , called the @entity126 , has some seemingly odd provisions , including one that , according to @entity129 , allows authorities to access e-mail that 's more than 6 months old without a warrant from a judge			1
all that 's needed is a subpoena , which is easier to obtain			0
" it 's not yet clear on precisely what legal authority the @entity18 obtained access to @entity21 's e-mail , " @entity97 says , " but under the relevant federal statute , the @entity126 , the government need do little more than ask			0
" tech companies want to make it harder for law enforcement to read your e-mail : as @entity149 reports for @entity150 , the tech companies that control most of the digital info stored by @entity111 these days actually want that law to change			1
" @entity152 is an active member of the @entity154 , which has been pushing for reform of the @entity126 , " she writes			0
" the group 's members include @entity158 , @entity159 , the @entity9 , @entity122 , @entity152 and @entity160 along with a slew of other big - name tech companies and civil liberties groups			1
" the @entity164 opposes reform on the grounds it would make it more difficult for investigators to obtain e-mail communications			0
still , search engines may pose the biggest privacy threat : it 's worth noting that when you send an e-mail or post something on @entity122 , you usually expect someone else to see it , although maybe not everyone , and probably not the @entity18			1
as @entity179 writes for @entity180 , however , search engines such as @entity152 are the ones that know your " real secrets " since it does n't feel like anyone else would see what you 're searching for			0
but , because of search , @entity152 " knows the things you would n't ask your friends			0
it knows things you ca n't ask your spouse			0
it knows the things you have n't asked your doctor yet			0
it knows things that you ca n't ask anyone else and that might not have been asked at all before @entity152 existed , " he writes			0
" @entity152 's servers are a repository of the developed world 's darkest and most heartbreaking secrets , a vast closet lined with millions of digital skeletons that , should they escape , would spare nobody			1
" the search engine does anonymize data over time			0
" we strike a reasonable balance between the competing pressures we face , such as the privacy of our users , the security of our systems and the need for innovation			2
we believe anonymizing ip addresses after 9 months and cookies in our search engine logs after 18 months strikes the right balance , " @entity152 says on an faq page about privacy			2
so maybe all online communications -- every last @entity227 - connected keystroke -- should be thought of as public , until proven otherwise ? let us know what you think in the ( newly improved ) comments section below .			0

the @entity15 scandal raises *interesting* questions about privacy in the digital era
the @entity111 law governing digital privacy was last updated in 1986
tech companies and the @entity9 want to see protections in the law *tightened*
