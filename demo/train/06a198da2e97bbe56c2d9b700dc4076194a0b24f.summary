-- news that debris was found after an @entity4 flight went missing over the weekend marked the third major incident involving @entity7 airlines this year			1
in march , @entity8 went missing after it mysteriously deviated from its scheduled flight path from @entity10 to @entity11			0
the plane is believed to have been lost over the southern @entity13 near @entity14 , yet no wreckage has been found			0
then , in july , @entity16 was shot down over eastern @entity17 -- possibly by @entity19 separatists , although @entity20 suggested that @entity17 was in some way responsible			0
so , are passengers traveling in @entity7 rattled ? the latest incident has certainly fanned concern that travelers might lose confidence in regional airlines altogether , particularly @entity29 carriers			1
yet although @entity31 was an @entity4 flight , it was operated by @entity4 , which is not a @entity29 airline and is instead majority - owned by @entity35 interests			1
( the @entity4 group has similar minority holdings in subsidiaries in @entity39 , the @entity40 , @entity41 , and , soon , @entity42 , although these subsidiary airlines use the @entity4 brand )			2
yet while travelers will likely be somewhat unsettled by this year 's developments , @entity4 will probably weather this difficult period			1
after all , the group pioneered the low - cost model in @entity7 , and has built a strong reputation for affordable and safe flying			1
until the @entity31 incident , more than 200 million passengers had flown on the @entity4 network , including its long - haul arm @entity55 , with no plane having been lost			1
led by its formidable founder and ceo @entity58 , the airline has built a reputation as the champion of the average passenger in the face of more expensive full - service carriers			2
missing planes and air disasters : how bad was 2014 ? in the process , the airline has won the loyalty and gratitude of millions of working - class asians for whom flying has become an affordable reality			1
it is therefore unlikely that recent unfortunate incidents will be able to change this			0
what about rivals swooping in to pick up the business ? the reality is that there is no @entity84 low - cost competitor with operations on the scale of @entity4 's			1
indeed , because of restrictions in most countries in the region that prohibit foreigners from holding majority stakes in local airlines , @entity4 has had to improvise by establishing minority - owned subsidiaries all over @entity7			1
and , although these are technically separate airlines , their common branding and @entity96 booking platform ensures that there is only one @entity4 in most passengers ' minds			1
that said , the way @entity4 manages the crisis will also be critical in determining its future			2
so far , the consensus seems to be that @entity58 is faring pretty well by being open , forthright and consistent with the families and media			0
however , much will ultimately depend on what actually happened to @entity31			2
if it is determined to have been a weather - related accident , as has been widely suggested , the traveling public is likely to see this as a one - off event that can eventually be overlooked			2
it will only be if the airline itself is found to be somehow at fault -- or perhaps if the cause of the incident remains unexplained -- that there may be some lingering concerns among passengers			0
all this said , air transport is undergoing phenomenal growth in @entity7 , with the region poised to overtake @entity127 as the world 's largest and most dynamic aviation market			0
this suggests that the three , likely unrelated , incidents this year should not warrant sweeping generalizations or suggestions that airlines in the region have somehow become less safe than airlines elsewhere			0
of course , such incidents should still serve to remind airlines and governments everywhere that safety is of paramount importance , and that the explosive growth of air travel must also be accompanied by stringent safety and security standards			0
but for now , passengers in @entity7 are savvy enough to understand the difference between a trend and tragic but isolated accidents .			0
