-- @entity3 migration to the @entity4 may have stalled , as a new study shows , but the political and social debates over immigrants living in the @entity4 are n't going anywhere , experts say			1
the immigration debate is reflected in a number of policies and proposals , most recognizably state immigration laws that are being challenged			0
oral arguments are scheduled at the @entity16 on wednesday as the justices decide whether @entity18 can enforce its controversial immigration law			2
a bill in @entity21 that would require police to check the immigration status of all those arrested died in the @entity25 this month			0
amid the backdrop of contentious debates comes a study this week from the @entity29 , which finds that for the first time in decades , the flow of @entity3 migrants to and from the @entity4 balances out			1
the effect may be even more pronounced			0
according to the report , " the trend lines ... suggest that return flow to @entity3 probably exceeded the inflow from @entity3 during the past year or two			2
" " the largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the @entity4 has come to a standstill , " the report announces			2
the report 's findings were n't a surprise to several @entity3 immigrants in @entity47 , who said they 've seen the political and economic situation shift dramatically in recent years			1
" it is n't like it was before			0
the work is very hard			0
life is very expensive , " said @entity54			0
" it 's not the @entity4 it was 30 years ago			1
" @entity57 said her nieces in @entity3 want to come to the @entity4 , but ca n't			1
" they have n't been able to come because of the situation , because there is not enough work , and more than anything because crossing is quite dangerous , so there are many obstacles , " she said			0
those who study immigration trends and policy agree that the apparent standstill in immigration is significant , but to varying degrees they say it will do little to change attitudes and actions in the @entity4			1
@entity76 , senior demographer at the @entity29 and one of the report 's authors , said that as @entity3 families have fewer children , the number of potential immigrants is shrinking			2
also , the @entity3 economy is improving and providing jobs that before were n't available and provided a push to look for opportunities in the @entity4			1
" it 's likely impossible that we 'll get back to the level of immigration that we saw 10 years ago			1
it 's possible that the flows may pick up , but i do n't think they will get anywhere near where they were in 2000 , " @entity76 said			2
" people have been talking about the return flow for a couple of years , but it just was n't showing up in the data , and now we 're beginning to see it , " he added			0
but the forces that pull immigrants to the @entity4 and push them from @entity3 have not disappeared			1
" it 's a little premature to say that part of history is over , " said @entity106 , president and ceo of @entity108 , a federation of small - business owners in favor of immigration reform			0
there are a number of factors that may have affected the recent trend : better enforcement in the @entity4 , demographic changes in @entity3 and the economic downturn in the @entity4			1
" we have three different reasons , and we do n't know how important each one of these reasons is , " she said			0
as those factors shift -- for example , as the @entity4 economy improves -- the demand for immigrant workers in the @entity4 will rise , she said			1
an improving situation in @entity3 could result in fewer @entity3 migrating to the @entity4 , but people from @entity134 countries could fill that void			1
even if not as large as before , a future demand for immigrants in the @entity4 will mean a continuation of the debates of today			1
the news produced in the @entity29 report may relieve some people 's anxieties , but for many illegal immigration critics , the real problem is n't the immigrants arriving today but the cumulative effects of immigrants who have arrived illegally over the past 30 years , @entity106 said			1
@entity149 , executive director of the @entity150 , said there is no question that immigration from @entity3 has slowed , but it does n't mean nobody is coming			2
" the claim that this is a permanent development is premature , " said @entity149 , whose center favors a restrictive approach to immigration policy			0
" when our economy picks up , what happens then ? " he asked			0
@entity149 said he sees the pause in @entity3 migration as an opportunity to build up enforcement against future illegal immigration			2
" the conclusion i draw from this is that we have breathing space to put enforcement measures in place that we will need when these pressures mount again , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity172 contributed to this report .			0

new : " it 's not the @entity4 it was 30 years ago , " one immigrant says
a new study says *net* flows from @entity3 into the @entity4 have stopped
better conditions in @entity3 mean less desire to *emigrate* to the @entity4
but future demand means the controversial debates will continue
