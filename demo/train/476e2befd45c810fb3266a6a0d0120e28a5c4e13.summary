-- family , food and faith have guided @entity4 to where she is today			1
the 41 - year - old chef has been cooking up a storm with her tv shows and restaurant for over a decade , adding a dash of color and flavor to @entity14 's cultural life			1
a third generation @entity15 who grew up in the suburbs of @entity19 in the 1970s , @entity4 left @entity20 to work for an advertising agency			1
she soon realized , however , that making people feel bad in order to make them buy things they did n't want was n't for her			2
making people happy through good food was much more appealing			2
after leaving the advertising industry she worked part - time for a caterer where she saw a way to combine the love of cooking she inherited from her mother with a growing interest in creating her own business			2
she opened her first restaurant " @entity37 " 10 years ago and it has since become a fixture on the @entity19 restaurant scene			1
" when i opened the goal was very simple			2
i wanted to fill it every night and serve really fantastic , amazing , fresh @entity15 food out of this funny little arty place , " she told @entity0			0
" and i love running a business			0
and i love what it brings out of you			0
you find these hidden strengths you find that you did n't know you had			0
" since then @entity4 has developed a larger profile through her cooking shows and recipe books			1
she also let cameras follow her to southern @entity15 and the village where her great grandfather once lived ; the first time a member of @entity4 's immediate family had been there in 90 years			1
it was a world apart from the suburban @entity14 that @entity4 knew			1
coming from the only @entity15 family in her suburb , @entity4 says she always felt different from other children			1
" i certainly felt different when i 'd go to school and open the lunch box and there i 'd have last night 's rice and soy sauce chicken wings and my friend had the @entity70 sandwiches , " she told @entity0			0
" and that point it was very good to be different because our food was so much more interesting			0
yes , i felt different , yes , my brothers felt different			0
but it really did n't affect us negatively at all			0
" in touch with her roots and a vast extended family ( family reunions number in the hundreds ) @entity4 is also a practicing @entity82 who cooked for the @entity84 when he visited @entity14 in 2009			1
" it was one of the great weeks of my life			0
i still ca n't believe that it actually happened			0
we spent all week with him backstage in @entity19 , " she said			1
" his practice just really encouraged me to keep practicing and doing what we 're doing , and to always try harder and harder in everything we do			2
and to know every single thing that we feel , or think , or do , makes a really big difference			0
