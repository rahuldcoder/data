@entity0 , @entity1 -- when you refuse to acknowledge a group of people in all their nuances and complexities , or depict them as predictable and one - dimensional , or dictate for them a code of acceptable behavior , it is a blatant sign of disrespect			2
it would be offensive for someone to suggest that all @entity15 - @entity14 think a certain way , all @entity16 - @entity14 behave a certain way or all african - americans vote a certain way			1
so it is with 50.5 million @entity14 , who come in every variety imaginable			1
you might know this from what you consume daily in the form of political messaging , media images and advertising campaigns from @entity29			0
what better time to assert the right of @entity14 to be unpredictable and complicated human beings than @entity32 , which gives @entity14 the chance to learn more about , and pay respect to , the nation 's largest minority			1
in 1968 , @entity37 set aside one week each year to honor the contributions and culture of @entity14			1
in 1988 , president @entity40 signed legislation expanding the period to 30 days : september 15 to october 15			0
a generation or two ago , the challenge for @entity14 was simply to get noticed by corporations and political parties			1
ten million votes cast in a presidential election , and roughly $ 1 trillion in buying power , is hard to ignore			0
today , the new challenge is to get those same corporations and political parties to see @entity14 as they really are as opposed to how others want them to be or assume them to be			1
for example , in the past several weeks , i 've been asked often on radio and television interviews to predict where the @entity14 vote will go in the 2012 election			1
my answer : just about everywhere			0
will @entity14 take a chance on the @entity66 presidential nominee -- especially if it is @entity68 gov. @entity67 who has a record of attracting @entity71 support to the point of being attacked by @entity66 rivals who mistakenly cast the immigration debate as " us " vs. " them " and put @entity14 in the " them " camp ? or will they double down by sticking with president @entity79 who , while earning two - thirds of the @entity14 vote in 2008 , also heads an administration that has repeatedly lied to and manipulated @entity14 by promising immigration reform but delivering only record numbers of deportations -- more than 1 million since @entity79 took office ? my answer : yes			1
both those things will happen			0
this is not a monolith			0
the @entity71 population in the @entity91 is made up of conservatives , liberals , middle - of - the - road moderates , republicans , @entity95 , independents and everything in - between			1
it 's true that most @entity14 are registered @entity95 , just like they have been for the past five decades dating back to the " @entity100 " clubs in 1960			1
but it is also true that @entity14 have -- in gubernatorial , congressional and presidential races over the years -- been willing to cross party lines and support moderate @entity66 who eschew anti-hispanic nativism and craft a message that appeals to them			2
you see that sort of thing much more often at the local and state level than you do in the federal arena			0
the list of @entity66 who enjoyed significant @entity14 support in their political careers is long and distinguished			2
it includes @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , former @entity125 mayor @entity124 and two former @entity127 governors -- @entity128 and @entity129			0
of course , among @entity14 , there are differences in geography , economic status and educational attainment that help shape how they see the world and their place in it			2
there are also ancestral differences			0
according to the 2010 census , about two - thirds of those 50.5 million people are @entity143 or @entity144			2
the other third is made up of @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and others			0
sen. @entity154 , a @entity146 - @entity91 and self - described " son of exiles " who is being talked about as possibly landing on the 2012 @entity66 presidential ticket , is the darling of @entity159			2
yet , if @entity154 were on the @entity66 ticket , he is likely to be very unpopular in the @entity161 where many @entity143 - @entity14 resent @entity154 's hard line on illegal immigration			1
it 's easy to talk tough about border security or oppose " amnesty " when you represent a community in which came here on the red carpet of the @entity170 , a relic of the @entity172 that makes it almost impossible to remove @entity146 immigrants once they arrive on these shores			0
but besides those differences , there are also similarities			0
regardless of their backgrounds or biographies or biases , hispanics want what the rest of their countrymen want : the chance to work for a brighter tomorrow , the right blend of rights and responsibilities and the respect that comes from being seen as individuals and not just part of a group			0
and why not ? that 's the @entity91 way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197			2

@entity197 : do **n't** *stereotype* @entity14 americans
he says *thursday* marks beginning of @entity32 month
people ask which candidates are going to get the @entity14 vote ?
@entity197 : @entity91 's 50 million hispanics are **n't** a single bloc
