@entity0 -- president @entity2 spoke separately friday with speaker @entity3 and the top @entity5 @entity4 to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year , after @entity9 disarray in the @entity10 put the negotiations in limbo			1
in a previously unscheduled statement to reporters , @entity2 outlined a possible agreement that he said would include protecting middle - class @entity16 from a tax hike , extending unemployment benefits and setting a framework for future deficit reduction steps			2
he called on @entity22 to pass the agreement after a @entity24 break so he can sign it before the end of the year , when the fiscal cliff arrives in the form of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts			0
" laws can only pass with support from @entity32 and @entity9 , " @entity2 said in urging both sides to compromise			1
the president planned to fly with his family to @entity35 on friday night for the holiday and return to @entity0 after @entity24 , while @entity38 and @entity5 members also headed home with plans to return on december 27 if needed			2
@entity3 's spokesman said the speaker will be " ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of @entity22 " when he returns to @entity0			1
what failure on fiscal deal means for troubled @entity3 while congressional leaders continued to bicker friday over the next step , the president 's phone discussion with @entity3 and a @entity38 meeting with senate majority leader @entity50 signaled an attempt to provide the nation and investors with hope that an agreement can be reached			1
an aide to @entity50 said the short - term proposal to avoid the fiscal cliff should include extending tax cuts for middle - class families and unemployment insurance while delaying the automatic spending cuts set to take effect in the new year			0
@entity2 acknowledged what had become obvious : the broader deficit reduction deal he seeks will likely come in stages , rather than in the so - called grand bargain he and @entity3 have been negotiating			1
the main issue of disagreement continued to be taxes , specifically whether rates should go up on top income brackets for the wealthiest @entity16 as part of an agreement to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt			2
without a deal , the fiscal cliff could trigger a recession , economists warn			0
stocks closed down sharply on friday over the latest impasse in the deficit talks , a sign of investor fears of a slowdown as the nation slowly continued to emerge from recession			0
before leaving town , @entity3 puts fiscal cliff onus on @entity2 earlier friday , @entity50 called for @entity94 to quickly approve a @entity5 plan championed by @entity2 that would extend tax cuts for family income up to $ 250,000 while allowing rates to return to higher levels of the 1990s above that threshold			1
his @entity9 counterpart , sen. @entity101 of @entity102 , responded that the @entity5 should instead take up a @entity38 @entity9 measure extending the tax cuts for everyone as a temporary move before negotiations next year on broader tax reform			1
the @entity9 revulsion over any kind of tax rate increase has stymied deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama , such as @entity114 recently filibustering his own proposal and thursday night 's rebuff by @entity94 of an alternative tax plan pushed by @entity3 , their leader			1
@entity3 said at a news conference friday that his @entity9 colleagues refused to back his plan , which would have extended all tax cuts except for income over $ 1 million , because of fears of being blamed for a tax increase			1
" they were n't taking it out on me , " he said			0
" they were dealing with the perception that somebody might accuse them of raising taxes			0
" the lack of backing by his own caucus was a political blow to @entity3 and raised more questions than answers about what happens next in the tough negotiations with @entity2 on either a broad deficit reduction agreement or a smaller step to avoid the fiscal cliff			1
a breakdown of @entity3 's miscalculation on @entity148 a senior @entity32 @entity5 source said scenarios under consideration by the party include trying to work out short - term or comprehensive agreements now , or going into next year -- and over the fiscal cliff -- without a deal to quickly pass a compromise plan in the new @entity22 that convenes on january 3			1
waiting until next year would make the vote a tax cut from the automatic higher rates that will take effect under the fiscal cliff , instead of the current situation of extending some cuts and having top rates go up , the source noted			0
in addition , @entity32 will have two more seats in the new @entity5 and a stronger @entity38 minority , as well as increased pressure on @entity9 to keep taxes low on middle class @entity16 , according to the source			1
three possible scenarios @entity32 may pursue trying to hammer out a deal now means working with limited time and stronger @entity9 contingents in both chambers , the source said			1
@entity3 made clear friday that the negotiations with @entity2 on a broad deficit reduction agreement hit an impasse this week when both sides offered their " bottom line " positions that included major concessions -- but remained a few hundred billion dollars apart			1
with his alternative plan torpedoed by his own party , @entity3 said it now is time for @entity2 and @entity5 @entity32 to come up with a solution			1
@entity3 also denied a reporter 's suggestion that he is walking away from further talks , but he offered no timetable or mechanism for resuming discussions			2
in the @entity5 , @entity50 said all @entity38 measures on the fiscal cliff so far have failed to meet the minimum demands of @entity2 , such as wealthy @entity16 paying more to prevent an increased burden on middle - class families			2
" i like @entity3 , but gee whiz , this is a pretty big political battering that he has taken , " @entity50 said , calling on the speaker to allow a vote on the @entity5 - passed @entity2 plan			1
democrats will vote for it			0
some republicans will vote for it			0
that is what we are supposed to do			0
" on thursday night , the @entity38 passed a measure that would reduce the impact of the fiscal cliff 's automatic spending cuts on the military			2
however , the chamber then went into recess when it was clear @entity3 lacked the votes for his separate tax plan that maintained cut rates on income up to $ 1 million			2
conservatives opposed to any kind of increase in tax rates refused to sign on , and with @entity32 unified in their opposition , the measure had no chance of passing			2
fallout from fiscal cliff inaction " there was a perception created that that vote last night was going to increase taxes			0
i disagree with that characterization , " @entity3 said friday by way of explanation , adding that " the perception was out there , and a lot of our members did not want to have to deal with it			0
" @entity50 had said the @entity5 would spurn the @entity3 plan if it passed the @entity38 , and @entity2 promised to veto it if it reached his desk			1
according to @entity9 sources , the zero chance for @entity3 's @entity148 to actually become law influenced some wavering @entity38 members to reject it			1
@entity2 campaigned for re-election on extending the tax cuts that date back to his predecessor 's administration on income up to $ 250,000 for families , but returning to higher rates on amounts above that threshold			2
some @entity38 @entity9 have said they would join @entity32 in supporting the president 's proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek			1
the @entity148 was significant because @entity9 leaders previously insisted they would n't raise rates on anyone			0
@entity3 had complained thursday that in making that concession , he expected but never got significant concessions from @entity2			2
he elaborated on the negotiations friday , saying he told @entity2 that his latest proposal made over the weekend was his bottom line			0
@entity3 said @entity2 told him the @entity38 counterproposal monday was the president 's bottom line			1
@entity3 also repeated his complaint that @entity2 and @entity32 were unwilling to address the spending cuts and entitlement reforms that he considers necessary to properly address the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt			1
" what the president has proposed so far simply wo n't do anything to solve our spending problems , " @entity3 said , noting that " because of the political divide in the country , because of the divide here in @entity0 , trying to bridge these differences has been difficult			0
" @entity1 poll : are @entity9 policies too extreme ? in his statement friday , @entity2 said he had compromised at least halfway on major issues , and that both sides have to accept they will not get all they want			2
the possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt			0
now legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction , such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318			0
polling has consistently shown most @entity16 back the president , who insists wealthy @entity16 must pay more , rather than @entity3 and his @entity9 colleagues , who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms			1
a new @entity1 / @entity326 survey released thursday showed that just over half of respondents believe @entity9 should give up more in any solution and consider the party 's policies too extreme			0
opinion : @entity3 leading @entity9 to the apocalypse the two sides seemingly had made progress earlier this week on forging a $ 2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by @entity2 and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by @entity3			1
the president 's latest offer set $ 400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase , up from his original plan of $ 250,000			0
it also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to some entitlement benefits , much to the chagrin of liberals			0
called chained @entity351 , the new formula includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years			0
statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean @entity316 recipients would get $ 6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained @entity351			0
liberal groups sought to mount a pressure campaign against including the chained @entity351 after news emerged this week that @entity2 was willing to include it , calling the plan a betrayal of senior citizens who had contributed throughout their lives for their benefits			0
poll : @entity16 view economy as poor , split on future @entity1 's @entity375 , @entity376 and @entity377 contributed to this report .			0
