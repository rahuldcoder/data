@entity18 's original @entity8 has been operating for over a decade , but its popularity only exploded earlier this year after its " anti-loneliness " concept went viral			1
plush creatures to save its lone customers from the awkward perils of solo dining , a plush @entity8 character is brought over to the table as dining companion			0
" i thought if people can stay and sit with @entity8 characters like @entity53 and @entity54 ( parents in the @entity26 family ) , it 'd be more interesting , " says @entity48 , who came up with the cafe concept			2
but @entity7 's single diners may have to fight for an adorable meal buddy			1
" unlike @entity18 's anti-lonliness cafes , @entity8 characters will be placed at various tables and joining a @entity8 character will be up to luck , " says cafe spokeswoman @entity59			1
@entity59 says the @entity7 location will have three additional characters not featured in the @entity18 outlets : @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2

" i love the venison soup stew , salmon milk soup and @entity37 's temptation ( baked potato with caramelized onion gratin ) , which are traditional @entity10 dishes , " says @entity80			1
" i really want to introduce @entity26 and @entity21 lifestyle to @entity7 people			2
" the cafe also serves @entity21 traditional bread called @entity91 and @entity93 salad with pickled herring , as well as a @entity10 dish of salmon with goat cheese and basil			1
