-- mrs. @entity1 is on the cover of @entity3 this week			1
not to tout her new education initiative or lament the country 's wage gap , but because she 's 50			2
do n't get me wrong			0
i 'm happy that mrs. @entity1 is able to celebrate her special day with loved ones , but articles about women turning the big 5 - 0 often get under my skin			1
and not in a good way			2
people not only asked mrs. @entity1 if she had " peaked at 50 , " but whether she would consider plastic surgery or @entity16			1
the magazine also touched on how the extremely buff mrs. @entity1 would change her exercise routine in light of her advancing age			1
seriously ? i do n't recall anyone asking mr. @entity22 , when he turned 50 , whether he 'd consider " fillers " to plump his thin cheeks or quit playing basketball			1
honestly , i never think about being 50 until i read articles either informing me " i can still be sexy at 50 if i do a little something , something , ... " or " become a proud cougar and date a younger man			2
" in yesterday 's @entity33 , there was an article about the " @entity35 of @entity36			0
" women in their late 40s and 50s are pictured in tiny bikinis and gold bling			1
@entity41 , one of the " @entity35 , " is pictured beside a hunky , younger man			2
the article reads , " the blonde bombshell is remarkably youthful for her 55 years , and that may be well to a little help from the surgeon 's knife			0
" i 'm happy @entity41 is living her life the way she chooses , but i ca n't help but think of that @entity53 's @entity52 character on @entity54 when i look at her			0
remember her ? @entity52 wore tight , high - waisted pants and carried a leopard handbag			0
she took every opportunity to " strut her stuff , " proclaiming , " my name is @entity52			0
i 'm proud to say i 'm 50 years old			2
i 'm one of those gals who likes to tell her real age			0
and i like to kick ! stretch ! and kick ! i 'm 50			0
fifty years old ! " funny , how attractive women spend their 20s trying to be taken seriously , only to wish not to be taken seriously when they hit 50			1
i 'll end my rant by saying happy birthday , mrs. @entity1			1
and thank you for answering people 's @entity16 question like this : " women should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves			1
right now , i do n't imagine that i would go that route , but i 've also learned never to say never			0
" you go , girl			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity79 .			1

@entity1 , turning 50 , was pictured on cover of @entity3
@entity79 : would @entity22 be asked about plastic surgery and exercise routine at 50 ?
she says some women fight to be taken seriously at 20 and not to be at 50
@entity79 : first lady is right that women should have freedom to feel good about themselves
