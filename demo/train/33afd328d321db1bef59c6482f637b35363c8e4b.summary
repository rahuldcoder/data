there are two web clips featuring @entity2 that have been getting a lot of attention			1
clip no. 1 features a host of celebrities and community leaders , including @entity2 , involved with a movement trying to ban the use of the word " bossy " in reference to young girls			1
the reason being that " bossy " is often used in a derogatory way to describe girls who display leadership traits , thus discouraging them from asserting themselves			2
" i 'm not bossy , i 'm the boss , " the superstar says			0
clip no. 2 features @entity2 wearing a bedazzled thong and not much else , as she sings about ejaculate landing on her dress after performing oral sex in the back of a limo			1
" i just want to be the girl you like , " she pleads to her husband , @entity27 , in the " @entity31 " video , the second single from her latest release , " @entity2			1
" the first single , " @entity43 " , included a line from her husband that made light of a domestic violence scene documented in the @entity39 biopic " what 's @entity41 got to do with it			2
" beyonce the artist is above reproach			0
with 17 wins , she has only one less grammy than @entity48			0
she has more than 13 million @entity50 followers despite only tweeting eight times			0
and she famously crashed @entity52 by releasing a full cd without any promotion			0
however , @entity2 the role model is questionable as hell			1
i 'm all for handcuffs , hot wax , stripper poles , whips -- whatever it is two consenting adults want to do in the privacy of their bedroom to keep the relationship fresh			0
but increasingly , @entity2 has chosen not to keep such things private			1
the lyrics to " @entity31 " pale in comparison with some of the more graphic phrases heard on her latest cd , and many parents complained that having her sexually charged performance open this year 's @entity74 was inappropriate given the time of night			2
@entity2 : gender equality is a myth i was not one of those parents , mind you			1
but then again , i have a 17 - year - old son , not an 11 - year - old daughter			0
@entity83 's @entity82 was mocked recently for his pseudointerview with @entity85 , in which instead of talking about @entity85 ' new book on meditation -- which the hip - hop star came on the show to do -- he ranted about " @entity31			2
" " teenage girls look up to @entity2 , particularly girls of color , " @entity82 said			1
" why on @entity95 would this woman do that ? " and by " that , " he means sing about having sex in the back of a limo			1
" i believe an entertainer like @entity2 , and a mogul like you , have an obligation to protect children			2
not put out exploitative garbage that you know harm impressionable children , " he said			0
now as a fan of many genres of music , i know @entity82 could replace @entity2 's name with any number of popular artists and the question would still be applicable			1
for example , country artists sing about getting drunk and having sex in the back of pickups quite often			2
and in 2011 , the @entity121 reported teenage birth rates for 15 - to - 19 - year - olds were highest in states such as @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 , where country music is most popular			1
so @entity82 singling out the music of @entity2 can certainly be seen as either unfair or even a not - so - subtle attack on the @entity132 , given @entity2 's ties to the administration			1
but @entity82 's motives aside , @entity2 does position herself as a role model for young girls			1
like the " @entity141 " video encouraging young girls to be leaders			2
or the " @entity147 " video released in conjunction with @entity145 's anti-obesity campaign directed at kids			2
i doubt the first lady would be happy to see @entity150 or @entity151 dancing to " @entity31 " the way @entity2 does in her music video			1
not because dancing seductively or expressing sexuality through song is inherently wrong			0
but doing so at 15 and 12 -- while singing " i just want to be the girl you like " -- is n't ideal			0
currently , @entity158 is heavily promoting the video , and the song jumped from no. 97 to no. 23 on @entity161 in one week			0
of course the president and first lady are excellent parents who will guide their daughters down the appropriate path			0
unfortunately , too many daughters , too many children have tvs for baby sitters			0
that is n't @entity2 's cross to bear			1
nor is it a cross @entity82 should attempt to leave on her doorstep			0
but it is a cross any artist who brands herself or himself as a role model for young impressionable minds needs to be aware of			0
@entity2 makes grown - folks music , and i love it			1
but if she truly wants to be kid - friendly , she should consider leaving the foreplay in the bedroom because trying to have it both ways makes parenting for some harder than it should be .			0

@entity2 appears in two popular new videos ; one is to encourage girls to be assertive
the other is a *suggestive* music video partly about having sex in the back seat of a limo
@entity201 says @entity2 's music appeals to grown - ups , but is it appropriate for girls ?
he says it would be better if she did n't *mix* *messages* for those who look up to her
