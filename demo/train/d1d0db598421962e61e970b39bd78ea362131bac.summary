-- in homes all across @entity3 , working parents struggle to pay their bills at the end of the month			2
college graduates move back in with their parents because student loan debts are so high			0
@entity10 families juggle two jobs just to afford their rising health care premiums			0
these are the problems @entity3 face every single day , in every state across the country			2
as the heads of the @entity19 communications offices in the @entity20 and the @entity21 , it 's our job to listen to these problems and share @entity19 solutions			1
our party has heard @entity3 ' concerns , and that 's why we 've put forward hundreds of bills to help grow the economy , create jobs , expand opportunity and give @entity3 families hope for tomorrow			1
our conversations with people back home , from the supermarket to the church pews to the doctor 's office , have helped us develop legislative solutions that will make life better for @entity3 in every corner of this country			2
the @entity20 @entity19 majority has passed one jobs bill after another -- bills like the @entity48 , which eliminates costly regulations for small and medium - size businesses , and which passed the @entity20 with the support of 36 @entity52			1
the @entity20 passed the @entity3 's @entity53 , which gives small businesses more certainty by making permanent the maximum expensing allowance at $ 500,000 , and the measure passed with the support of 53 @entity52			1
and @entity20 @entity19 advanced the bipartisan @entity58 , which would help @entity3 's veterans get back to work by excluding them from @entity63 's employer mandate threshold and therefore incentivizing businesses to hire them , and that legislation passed the @entity20 with almost unanimous @entity66 support			1
and those are just the beginning			0
unfortunately , once these bills go to the @entity71 - led @entity21 , their progress comes to an abrupt halt			1
scores of jobs bills and other important legislation are currently gathering dust on senate majority leader @entity78 's desk			2
the same thing has happened to @entity21 republicans			1
@entity21 @entity19 have put forward numerous bills to help create jobs and opportunities and solve the challenges facing working families , but @entity78 has resolutely refused to allow any of them to come to the floor			1
and @entity21 @entity19 have repeatedly been prevented from offering amendments to @entity71 bills , including amendments that would have garnered bipartisan support , like an amendment to repeal @entity63 's burdensome medical device tax			1
while the @entity66 majority in @entity95 refuses to debate the challenges facing the @entity3 people , @entity19 continue to introduce solutions			1
while @entity78 ties up the @entity21 with political gimmicks and boutique bills designed to appeal to @entity52 ' far - left base -- like this month 's effort to erase the free speech clause of the @entity103 with a proposed constitutional amendment on campaign contributions that would have empowered incumbent politicians to suppress the speech of their constituents -- @entity19 move forward pro-jobs , pro-growth legislation that will get @entity3 back to work			1
while @entity52 stand in the way of 21st - century solutions that will move our economy forward , republicans continue to advance them			1
the contrast between the two parties could n't be more clear : @entity19 are working to create jobs for @entity3			2
@entity52 are working to save their own			0
@entity3 families ca n't afford to keep waiting for @entity52 to get their act together			0
unemployment is high , and jobs and opportunities are few and far between			0
@entity63 has driven up health care premiums and significantly reduced health care choices for some @entity3			0
gas prices have risen by 84 % since president @entity128 took office			0
and household income has fallen by about $ 2,600			0
right now , too many @entity3 are struggling to make ends meet , support their families , pay their premiums and get back to work			2
in fact , nearly one in three @entity3 says their financial situation has gotten worse in the past year			0
we want to make it better			2
but as long as @entity78 continues to obstruct meaningful legislation in the @entity21 , they 're not going to get them			2
the @entity3 people should not have to endure another two - year solutions blockade from @entity52			0
the @entity21 needs a new majority with leaders who understand that they were elected to govern and who will work with the @entity20 to actually pass legislation to address @entity3 's challenges and provide the relief hard - working @entity3 families need : more jobs , increased take - home pay and more opportunities for advancement , expanded workplace flexibility , lower energy prices and real health care reform that will lower costs and put patients in charge			1
it 's our hope that when @entity164 reconvenes next year , there will be new leadership in the @entity21			1
we need leaders who will create opportunities , not stand in the way of them			0
we 're ready and waiting to get things done for the @entity3 people			0
we just need willing partners			0
join us on @entity171 / @entity170 .			0

leaders of @entity19 *conferences* make their case for the *midterm* elections
they say a @entity19 - led @entity21 would result in a @entity164 that can solve problems
*authors* : @entity20 has passed bills to improve economy , but they 've been blocked in @entity21
