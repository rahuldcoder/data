-- silhouettes , vintage oil portraits , one - of - a - kind finds , bird imagery , lots and lots of patina -- sounds like a " @entity12 " cover of flea market finds and @entity11 artwork , right ? it absolutely is , said @entity14 , the features director for the magazine -- but it 's also the modern way to decorate for @entity17			1
" that elegant look , with , like , a slightly creepy factor , " she said , is dramatic -- maybe a little more than plastic spiders and faux - cobwebs			1
" the cabinet of curiosities , the ravens , the silhouettes , " she said , " even without @entity17 , i feel like that @entity27 look has become a huge trend in decorating , almost year - round			1
" " you might hang a bunch of these oil portraits on a gallery wall in your home			2
you do n't know who they are , you do n't have any connection with them , but they 're this window to what came before , " she said			0
" and some of those portraits can be downright creepy , too			0
" @entity17 provides adventurous decorators with the perfect opportunity to tinker with trends			1
@entity17 decorations like raven figurines , candelabras , edwardian - portrait zombie holograms or even feathered wreaths are part of the larger movement toward decorative items that feel more genuine , more authentic , more personal , she said			1
" a lot of shops , like @entity58 's and @entity59 , are selling products , especially holiday decor , that hark back to the early 1900s , " @entity14 said			1
" people want to feel connected to the past that way			0
" eschewing creepy green witch hands in candy bowls or gigantic plastic skeletons for something elegant and glitter - free does n't necessarily mean @entity17 decor has lost it 's scream factor , @entity14 said			1
the holiday has simply grown up a bit , and donned a more classic look			2
" @entity17 has always been a huge holiday for us at @entity12 , " she said , " but it seems over the years it 's become more of an adult holiday than it ever has before			1
people are n't just looking for cutesy , cartoon decorations and costumes			2
" so what is hot these days ? skulls of any sort , @entity14 said , birds -- the creepier the better -- bat silhouettes , wreaths and black lace			0
even the humble , snaggle - toothed jack - o ' - lantern is getting a makeover			0
" it 's amazing the things you can do with pumpkins when you think beyond carving , " @entity14 said			0
" in the past couple of years for @entity17 , we 've explored all sorts of different no - carve ideas			1
we 're huge fans of painting pumpkins			0
" " we 've done everything from painting a pumpkin a really beautiful sagey - green fall color and using a stencil to paint your door number on the pumpkin and putting it on your porch , " she said , to decoupaging pumpkins with fall leaves			2
so how can you add your own twist to @entity17 ? here are other lessons from this week 's @entity115 contributors : make it fun for kids and adults " we love @entity17 around our house because , for us , it 's the official kick - off to the holiday season			1
having said that , however , we have four tiny granddaughters , so all of our decorations are little - kid - friendly ! my porch decorations ( as well as the owl party favors ) center around cute @entity17 friends and my favorite fall elements : pumpkins , hay bails and mums ! " -- @entity133 " i balanced the kids ' requests for spooky @entity17 decor with my desire to keep things sophisticated			1
" -- @entity139 " i chose the ( styrofoam ) pumpkins because they last longer			0
with styrofoam pumpkins , you can decorate early and use the decor year after year ... as a mom on a budget , i definitely love that			1
" -- @entity147 tell a spooky story " my favorite piece ( s ) are the skull photos since they are from our vacation			0
my son loved visiting the ossuary on the outside of @entity157 and he is thrilled that they hang in our dining room for @entity17			2
" -- @entity160 " i looked at the vintage typewriter , the table and old door and thought to myself , ' there are many holiday stories that can be told with these three pieces			0
' for @entity17 , why not honor the great writer , @entity167 ? after that i began reading ( " @entity169 " )			2
the object was to place the reader inside the poem ... the raven rapping at the window , the narrator lamenting over his lost love , @entity175 , all while trying to preoccupy himself with a book of forgotten lore			0
