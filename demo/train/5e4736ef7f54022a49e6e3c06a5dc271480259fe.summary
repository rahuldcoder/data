-- if you thought the @entity4 's ruling two years ago remaking the individual mandate into a tax was the end of the legal threat to the @entity7 , think again			1
set aside @entity8 and similar lawsuits ; those are important for religious liberty but do n't threaten @entity7 's existence			2
instead , as we saw tuesday , courts are again considering serious challenges that strike at the core of how @entity7 operates			1
first , in @entity16 v. @entity17 , the @entity18 -- the federal appellate court that oversees executive agencies -- held that the @entity21 broke the law in issuing tax credits for people to buy policies from federal insurance exchanges			1
a couple of hours later , however , in @entity28 v. @entity17 , the @entity27 - based 4th @entity18 ruled in favor of the government 's authority to provide these credits			0
faq : what the @entity7 court decisions mean for you what 's going on here and what 's the big deal about some obscure tax regulations ? as it turns out , these tax credits , better known as subsidies , make @entity7 tick , even more than the individual mandate			1
without them , consumers face the full cost of health care , which is a sticker shock that would further turn the public against the law and finally force the administration to reopen it			1
it 's also these subsidies that trigger taxes on employers and individuals who do n't buy the requisite level of care			0
so what the two courts are debating is whether president @entity63 illegally spent billions of taxpayer dollars and subjected millions of people to illegal taxes			2
watchdog : fake applicants got @entity7 subsidies the problem lies buried deep in the text of the @entity7 , which provides federal subsidies only to taxpayers who enroll in exchanges " established by the state			1
" as judge @entity78 , a moderate @entity79 appointee who was supported by then - sen. @entity63 , wrote for the @entity18 , " the federal government is not a ' state , ' " and therefore " a federal exchange is not an ' exchange established by the state			2
' " that should be the end of the discussion , and it would be in any sane world			0
but the government and its defenders argue , apparently channeling @entity90 's mantra that a word means just what he chooses it to mean , that " established by a state " is synonymous with " established by the federal government			2
" thus , in the @entity28 ruling , judge @entity96 , whom @entity79 appointed in a good - faith gesture after his nomination expired under @entity100 , somehow found the language to be " ambiguous " and deferred to the agency 's reading			0
after all , why would n't @entity104 make subsidies available to all ? such questions of legislative history are irrelevant when the text is clear , but there 's actually a simple answer : the @entity7 's drafters wanted to give states an incentive to set up exchanges			1
that 's not uncommon ; for example , only residents of cooperating states get @entity121 assistance			0
unfortunately for @entity7 's proponents , however , only 14 states and the @entity123 chose to establish their own exchanges			1
if the @entity128 ruling is correct , that means millions of people in 36 states are receiving subsidies for which they are n't eligible			1
study : @entity7 gave 10 million @entity133 health insurance after - the - fact rationalizations notwithstanding , the concession that @entity7 's designers did n't anticipate so many state vetoes does n't retroactively rewrite the plain language of the law			1
the fault lies squarely with those drafters , not the lawyers who point out the @entity21 abuse or the judges who strike it down			0
the government will see rehearing by the entire @entity18 ; having stacked the court after senate majority leader @entity149 eliminated filibusters of judicial nominations , president @entity63 figures he has a good chance to reverse @entity16			0
at the same time , @entity153 , the lawyer for the plaintiffs in both cases , will bypass the similarly unfriendly @entity156 and ask the @entity4 to hear @entity28			0
the high court could decide not to act until the @entity18 rules , presumably eliminating the circuit split and thus the necessity of taking up the issue			0
but two more cases are coming behind these , one brought by @entity165 's attorney general and the other by the state of @entity168			0
waiting another year or two would only increase the economic damage of the @entity21 ' shell game			0
the sooner the administration is forced to fix @entity7 , the better for the country and its battered rule of law .			2

@entity175 : court challenges are striking at the core of how @entity7 operates
@entity175 : who is eligible for subsidies ? without them , consumers face full , high costs
@entity175 : law says those in state exchanges are eligible , not federal exchanges
@entity175 thinks millions of people in 36 states with federal exchanges get subsidies illegally
