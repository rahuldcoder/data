@entity0 -- prime shopping season might be underway this holiday season , but candidate shopping might be a little easier for voters next campaign season			1
@entity6 , 28 , was born and raised in suburban @entity7 , @entity8 , which has a population of about 46,000 people			0
@entity6 is so vested in her town that she decided to run for city council			0
to help her run her campaign , she enlisted family and friends			0
@entity6 did what any serious candidate would do			0
she engaged voters , planned and hosted campaign events and solidified a platform			2
it was a tall order for her and her loyal team of helpers who all simultaneously held down full time jobs			0
but she had checked all the boxes of a traditional campaign			0
she ultimately won , but an aspect of modern campaigning was missing and not within her reach			0
daunting for the political novice and attorney was creating an online presence			1
while the millennial is an avid user of social media and the @entity36 , she had no idea how to build a website , calling it " completely overwhelming			2
" plus , she did n't have the time or campaign cash to maintain it and update it			0
" i tried to set up a website and it 's not something that 's easy to do , " she said , acknowledging that a candidate must have a social presence to engage voters			1
businesses and brands are much more successful when there 's a website			1
it 's no different for political candidates			1
@entity53 perfected it , but many left out while the 2012 presidential race was a $ 1 billion campaign and most @entity60 and @entity61 races are multi-million - dollar episodes featuring an interactive website , it 's not in the cards for most running for some 550,000 state and local elected positions around the country			1
that 's what the founders of @entity70 set out to change , believing that an online presence will level the playing field for candidates , regardless of economic and political background and experience			1
@entity70 is the " social network for politics , " founder @entity77 said during a recent interview			1
he thought of the idea while attending the @entity82 where he worked to find a solution to the abundance of money in politics and a flawed campaign finance system , which is steeped in political agendas with little chance of being reformed anytime soon			2
" the only thing left was the marketplace of voter opinion , " @entity90 said			0
he noted that many candidates still did n't have an online presence in 2012 , four years after @entity53 revolutionized the use of the @entity36 to mobilize supporters			1
@entity90 formed a team with expertise in politics , tech and business , and received investor support to create a facebook - type website for political candidates			1
" for the first time , [ candidates ] can have an @entity53 quality " web presence , " @entity90 , a former @entity111 bond trader and filmmaker , said -- and at no cost			1
' democratizing democracy ' the portal includes every political office -- from school board in @entity118 , @entity119 , to @entity120			2
all candidates have to do is " claim " their profile and then it 's theirs to advertise campaign events , list their platform and raise money			2
it 's how we can " democratize democracy , " @entity131 , the organization 's co-founder and former @entity53 campaign organizer and state director			2
@entity90 said his goal is to " to see that elections are accessible to everyone			0
" he thinks he is doing just that by removing a significant technological and financial barrier			0
even the most obscure candidates representing obscure political parties can have a profile on @entity143			2
" it levels the playing field and encourages qualified individuals to run for office , " she said			0
@entity151 , @entity150 councilman @entity149 said @entity70 enabled him to reach voters he normally would n't be able to , especially on the fundraising front			1
" i would normally target relationships i already had , " @entity149 said of his 2013 re-election campaign			0
he said the public did n't donate to his campaign before he opened his profile , but then said , " i was reaching a wider universe " as voters took advantage of the donation mechanism on his @entity70 profile			1
@entity90 also said he could n't believe that in 2012 candidate information for voters still could n't be found in one place			0
so for the voter , it 's one - stop - shopping .			1

creating an online presence is a daunting task for many local political candidates
@entity70 founders bought the *url* and created a facebook - type website for political candidates
it 's set up to be easy - to - use for candidates and one - stop shopping for voters
