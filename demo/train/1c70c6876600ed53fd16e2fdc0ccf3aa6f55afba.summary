-- software giant @entity1 is offering a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of hackers behind a powerful computer virus that could lead to millions of pcs being hijacked			1
experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm			2
experts have so far been baffled by the true purpose of the @entity16 or @entity16 virus , but have described its spread as one of the most serious infections ever seen			1
the worm exploits a bug in @entity21 to infect mainly corporate networks , then -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it opens a link back to its point of origin , meaning it can receive further orders to wreak havoc			1
@entity1 has issued a patch to fix the bug , however if a single machine is infected in a large network , it will spread unchecked -- often reinfecting machines that have been disinfected			1
the threat from the virus prompted @entity1 in collaboration with other technology industry names to this week announce a $ 250,000 reward for information to track down those behind @entity16			1
" as part of @entity1 's ongoing security efforts , we constantly look for ways to use a diverse set of tools and develop methodologies to protect our customers , " said @entity41 , of @entity1 's @entity42			1
@entity51 , chief research officer at anti-virus firm @entity52 says the true scope of the virus is not known , but in the past 24 hours his company monitored @entity16 signals from two million internet protocol addresses			2
" that 's a lot , " he told @entity0			0
" and one ip address here does not mean one infected computer , it means at least one infected computer			0
" many of those ip addresses are obviously company proxies or firewalls , hiding hundreds of more infections behind it			0
unfortunately this also makes it impossible to estimate the total count of infected systems			0
" so it 's still big			0
" @entity1 has previously paid out similar rewards to informants who helped identify the creator of @entity75 , another notorious worm let loose in 2004			2
the perpetrator was tracked to @entity78 , where he was sentenced a year later .			0
