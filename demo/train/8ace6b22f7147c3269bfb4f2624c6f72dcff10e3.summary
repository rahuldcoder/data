-- did @entity2 rover opportunity order a jelly doughnut ? not quite , but scientists are baffled by a white rock with a dark red low spot in the middle that " just plain appeared at that spot " on the planet where the rover is situated , says @entity11 , lead scientist of the @entity12			1
in recent weeks , @entity13 took photos of the same spot on @entity2 , 12 days apart			1
the rover 's panoramic camera showed only barren bedrock on mission day 3528 ( in @entity2 time ) , but on day 3540 , a photo of the same scene revealed the mysterious , doughnut - shaped rock			1
@entity11 showed photos of this ghostly geological dessert at a recent @entity27 event celebrating 10 years since the @entity12 rovers landed on @entity2			1
spirit 's mission ended in 2010 after losing the use of two wheels , and ceasing to communicate			0
but @entity13 is still chugging along and finding new surprises , such as this rock			2
" one of the things i like to say is that @entity2 keeps throwing new things at us , " @entity11 said at the event , gesturing toward the rock photo and laughing			1
@entity27 : watch the presentation the photos of the outcrop showing the absence , and then presence , of the pastry - sized rock were taken 12 days apart			1
the rover had not driven over that spot , @entity11 said			2
there are two leading theories about where the rock , called " @entity53 , " came from			2
neither of them include the possibility of an intergalactic @entity58			0
the most likely scenario is that @entity13 flicked the rock with one of its wheels			2
" we had driven a meter or two away from here , and somehow maybe one of the wheels , kind of , managed to spit it out of the ground , and have it slide to this position , " @entity11 said			0
alternatively , there could be a smoking hole in the ground nearby and the rock could be a piece of crater ejecta , or piece of matter spewn from the impact of a meteorite			2
@entity11 does n't think this is as likely as the idea that the rover displaced the rock , however			1
opportunity is now studying the mystery rock more extensively , making measurements and taking pictures			1
its instruments have shown scientists that the " jelly " part is " like nothing we 've ever seen before , " @entity11 said			0
it 's very high in sulfur and magnesium , and it has twice as much manganese as has ever been seen in anything on @entity2			1
no one knows what that means			0
" we 're completely confused , we 're having a wonderful time , everyone on the team is arguing and fighting , " @entity11 said			0
spirit landed on january 4 , 2004 , followed by @entity13 on january 25 , 2004			1
their primary missions were designated for a mere 90 days , but both far outlasted that target			2
@entity11 said he used to think that no matter how long the rovers lasted , at some point there would be a point in the mission where the team could say " we 're finished " -- that they had learned everything could about @entity2 with those particular vehicles			1
but the @entity2 is n't like that			1
" there will be something tantalizing , something wonderful just beyond our reach that we did n't quite get to , and that 's the nature of exploration , " he said			0
opportunity has otherwise encountered scientifically important phenomena during its decade of investigation			0
at @entity132 , where it is today , the rover found clay minerals that form in watery conditions , and indicate that water with a neutral ph could have once been there , which would be conducive to microbial life if there had been any			0
@entity140 has also unveiled veins of a mineral that appears to be gypsum , which is deposited by water			0
opportunity is not the only robot roaming @entity2			1
@entity27 's 2 - ton curiosity rover , which landed in 2012 , has an even more powerful suite of scientific instruments			0
because of @entity146 's findings , @entity27 announced for the first time last year that life could have existed on @entity2			2
@entity27 is planning another rover mission in 2020 -- and that future robot could , possibly , collect samples that would later return to @entity155 for further study			0
such sophisticated technologies will help us see what other mysterious " sweets " the planet can deliver			0
