@entity0 -- a clerical misstep ? failure to double - check a routine process ? whatever the cause , the seemingly accidental outing of the @entity7 's top intelligence official in @entity8 could put the life of the spy and any family members in danger			1
it also raised the question of whether the official can continue working in @entity8 after the revelation in a @entity19 media report sent to about 6,000 journalists			1
" i think they are going to have to pull him out , now that he 's been identified publicly , " said @entity1 national security analyst @entity21 , noting the @entity22 would likely attempt to assassinate the official			1
" it will affect his career over the long term , too			0
" @entity29 , who covers national security issues for @entity31 , told @entity1 on tuesday the mistake was " catastrophic " for the official 's career and " potential future as a covert operator , both in @entity8 or anywhere else			1
" the official " was in the middle of a very dangerous mission , which was to govern the transition of @entity7 forces in @entity8 , " @entity29 noted			1
if forced to leave now due to danger over being exposed , the official 's absence could hurt the mission , according to @entity29			1
given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation , @entity1 has not broadcast or published online the name of the official			2
administration officials expressed alarm over the mistake			0
deputy national security adviser @entity54 told @entity1 's @entity55 that steps are being taken			2
" it should n't have happened			0
we 're trying to figure out why it happened			0
in fact , chief of staff @entity60 asked the @entity19 counsel to look into it , to figure out what happened and to make sure it wo n't happen again , " @entity54 said			2
asked whether the official will have to leave @entity8 , @entity54 added , " you 'll understand that i ca n't comment on the details , but you can rest assured that the security of this person is foremost in our minds and will be taken care of			1
" the official 's name was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for president @entity78 during his surprise visit to @entity80 in @entity8 on sunday			1
it 's common for such lists to be given to the media , but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided			0
in this case , the individual 's name was listed next to the title , " chief of station			2
" the common practice is for the print pool reporter -- a journalist representing the wider media contingent who relays information about an event to other reporters -- to copy and paste the list provided by the @entity19 into what is called a media pool report			2
it then gets distributed to a large list of media outlets by the @entity19 , which does not edit the list			2
in this case , the print pool reporter that day -- @entity108 , the @entity19 bureau chief for the @entity109 -- noticed the unusual entry after the @entity19 distributed the list			0
@entity108 checked it out with officials , and the @entity19 later distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief 's name			1
in his account to @entity1 , @entity108 said that when the media pool accompanying @entity78 arrived in @entity8 , he asked @entity19 officials for a list of who would be briefing the president			1
a @entity19 official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists			0
the official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line , " manifest for briefing for pool , " @entity108 told @entity1			0
that e-mail was forwarded to @entity108 , and he proceeded to copy and paste it for the pool report			0
@entity108 then sent it to the @entity19 official , who sent the report to the distribution list that reaches some 6,000 journalists			2
after the initial report was issued , @entity108 noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list			0
he flagged the @entity19 official , who checked with the military and then said : " this is a problem			0
" the @entity19 official asked if @entity108 would write another pool report that would advise journalists to disregard the previous report , which contained the chief of station 's name			1
@entity108 said he was open to the request and sent the @entity19 a new report , but he was unsure if it got distributed			0
according to @entity108 , another pool report from a different reporter that was distributed later included details from @entity78 's speech to the troops , as well as the shorter list of names that excluded the @entity7 official and a note saying , " this is the correct list of participants			1
" rep. @entity167 , @entity169 - @entity168 , called the accidental outing " unpardonable			1
" " this is something that they had a chance to look at and look at again , and they still allowed it to be out , " he told @entity1 's " @entity177 " tuesday night			0
" to me , it 's unforgivable and the message has to be sent that this type of incompetence -- six years into an administration -- is just inexcusable			1
" a station chief heads the @entity7 's office in a foreign country , establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities			1
the identity of station chiefs , like most @entity7 officers , are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly			0
in the most recent case of a spy being outed , the @entity194 administration infamously leaked the name of former @entity7 officer @entity198 to a journalist in 2003			0
@entity198 , who resigned from the @entity7 after the incident , tweeted on monday that the @entity19 's mistake this past weekend was " astonishing			2
" no one was punished for leaking @entity198 's @entity7 role to the media			2
@entity205 , the chief of staff to then - vice president @entity206 , was convicted of perjury , obstruction and lying to the @entity209 about the @entity198 leak			0
president @entity194 later commuted @entity212 's 30 - month prison sentence			0
top @entity214 spy pulled from @entity215 after terror threats @entity1 's @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			1

@entity225 : " to me , it 's unforgivable and the message has to be sent , " rep. @entity167 tells @entity1
@entity7 chief of station in @entity8 accidentally named in @entity19 media report
if forced to leave @entity8 , the official 's absence could hurt the @entity214 mission
analyst : " they are going to have to pull him out "
