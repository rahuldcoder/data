-- the death rate from cancer in the @entity3 has dropped dramatically in the last two decades , according to a new report from the @entity5			1
@entity3 cancer death rates have risen consistently since the 1900s ; they peaked in 1991 at 215.1 deaths per 100,000 in the population			1
the 2009 death rate , which just became available , is 173.1 per 100,000			2
that 's a 20 % decline in cancer death rates from 1991			1
the report also includes grim news			2
the @entity5 estimates 1.6 million @entity3 will be diagnosed with cancer and more than 580,000 will die of cancer in 2013			1
as has been the case for decades , only cardiovascular disease will kill more @entity3			0
the report , released thursday , compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence , mortality and survival			1
it is based on data gathered by the @entity25 , the @entity26 , and the @entity27			0
the decline in deaths from 1991 to 2009 is clear evidence of progress in the fight against cancer			2
it is far more powerful than other statistics such as increasing survival rates or declining incidence rates			1
the 20 % decrease translates into the prevention of 1.18 million cancer deaths			2
in 2009 alone , nearly 153,000 cancer deaths were prevented			0
cancer now no. 1 killer of @entity3 hispanics there were declines in the death rates for a number of major cancers			1
@entity50 , colorectal , breast and prostate cancer make up nearly half of all cancers diagnosed in the @entity3			1
all four had greater than 30 % decreases in mortality rates			1
the single biggest reason for this good news is reduction in smoking rates			1
improvements in early detection and cancer treatment also contributed to the decline			0
analysis of the data tells us that we can do better			0
substantially more lives could be saved if existing methods of cancer prevention and treatment were practiced more widely			0
this is incredibly important as the @entity3 population increases in size and the proportion of older @entity3 grows			0
the leading cause of cancer in the @entity3 is smoking			2
more than one in five @entity3 still smoke			0
in some states , such as @entity81 and @entity82 , nearly 30 % of residents smoke			0
these states have the highest cancer death rates			1
in other states , such as @entity87 and @entity88 , smoking rates are as low as 10 %			2
these states have the lowest cancer death rates			1
the obesity epidemic is also affecting cancer rates in a very negative way			1
indeed , obesity is the second leading cause of cancer			2
more than a dozen cancers -- from breast and prostate cancer to pancreatic and colon cancer -- have been linked to @entity3 's epidemic of high caloric intake and lack of physical activity			1
while 15 % of adults were obese in 1970 , more than 35 % were obese in 2010			0
even more concerning , 4 % of children aged 6 to 11 were obese in 1970 ; 20 % of that group were obese in 2010			0
while overall there is a significant decline in cancer mortality , the obesity epidemic is continuing to push the cancer mortality rate upward			1
a substantial proportion of @entity3 do not receive the high - quality preventive and treatment services that experts agree people should get			0
more than a third of women over 50 are not getting routine breast cancer screening			2
nearly half of @entity3 over 50 are not getting colon cancer screening			0
these are interventions about which there is no controversy			0
value of mass prostate cancer screenings questioned even more unsettling , a substantial number of @entity3 diagnosed with cancer are unable to get adequate treatment			1
if we simply get adequate medical care to those who need it , more lives could be saved			0
more from @entity137 : how doctors do harm			0

@entity5 releases annual report on mortality , survival
death rates declined for lung , colorectal , breast and prostate cancer
smoking and obesity still play a major role in causing cancer , @entity150 says
