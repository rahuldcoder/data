-- it was n't easy but @entity3 fans might not mind			1
@entity3 beat defending champion @entity5 4 - 2 on penalties at @entity7 on saturday to reach the @entity9 final and move a step closer to potentially ending a nine - year trophy drought			1
having given away a penalty early in the second half -- converted by @entity14 -- @entity3 's @entity15 then atoned for his mistake by scoring to send the game to extra time			2
backup @entity3 keeper @entity19 shone in the shootout , saving @entity5 's first two kicks			1
the win must have been a relief for @entity3 manager @entity24 , who is under pressure to deliver silverware after the @entity27 faded badly in the @entity29 title race			1
his contract is due to expire at the end of the campaign			0
for @entity5 , it can now fully concentrate on earning promotion back to the @entity29 , safely in a playoff spot in the second tier			1
@entity24 raised eyebrows when he started 21 - year - old @entity38 up front instead of top scorer @entity39 , even though the @entity40 under - 21 international had n't found the back of the net in nine previous games this season			1
the gamble did n't pay off			0
@entity38 's header in the fifth minute from @entity48 's perfect cross -- @entity48 sparkled in the first half -- was hit straight at @entity50 and the striker 's poor first touch when he was put through allowed the former @entity54 starter to make another save late in the half			0
the game opened up in the second half , with @entity3 doing the early pressing			2
but winger @entity59 , man of the match from last year 's @entity9 final , burst into the box and went down under a challenge from @entity15 to alter the momentum			1
referee @entity65 paused before pointing to the spot and @entity14 held his nerve to beat @entity19 in the 63rd minute , despite having to wait more than three minutes to take the penalty			0
another upset -- @entity5 ousted @entity70 in the quarterfinals -- was on the cards			2
@entity24 responded by taking off @entity74 international @entity73 -- one of @entity3 's liveliest players on the day -- for @entity39 , a decision booed by some @entity3 supporters			2
a botched @entity5 clearance allowed @entity48 to deliver another cross in the 80th minute and fullback @entity81 hit the post			2
@entity3 continued to press and only two minutes later @entity50 saved from @entity84 ' header -- with @entity85 clearing off the line as the ball went towards goal			0
the pressure paid off in the 82nd minute , however , @entity15 heading home @entity48 's cross			0
extra time proved to be less frenetic , although @entity48 's swerving shot struck the woodwork and @entity5 's @entity95 sent his header from a good position in the box wide			0
@entity5 manager @entity99 elected to save @entity14 for later in the penalty shootout and the move backfired			1
@entity19 stopped @entity102 and @entity95 to put @entity5 in an immediate hole and @entity104 officially booked @entity3 's ticket to the final when he beat @entity50			1
@entity3 faces either @entity107 or third - tier @entity108 -- they play sunday -- in next month 's final			2
but it was n't all good news for @entity3 on saturday			0
@entity112 overtook @entity3 for fourth in the @entity29 -- the final @entity115 spot -- after blanking last - place @entity116 1 - 0 for a sixth consecutive victory			1
@entity119 's own goal in the second half handed all three points to the visiting @entity112			0
with none of the title contenders playing until sunday , attention mostly turned to the bottom of the table			0
@entity127 beat @entity128 1 - 0 to move within two points of the road weary @entity128 , who occupy the final safety spot			1
@entity134 boosted its survival hopes by topping struggling @entity136 1 - 0 , @entity133 got a much needed win by surprising @entity138 1 - 0 away and @entity139 lost a fourth straight , 1 - 0 at @entity140			1
for the second time in two weeks at home , @entity141 could only manage a 3 - 3 draw after taking an early 2 - 0 lead , this time against @entity145			0
dropped points for @entity145 , though , dented their @entity115 ambitions			0
league leader @entity148 hosts third - place @entity70 on sunday while second - place @entity151 travels to @entity152 .			0
