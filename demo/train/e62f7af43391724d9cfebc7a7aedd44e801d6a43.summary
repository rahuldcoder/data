-- everybody knows the big - time accounts on @entity3 belong to celebrities -- the @entity5 and @entity6 and @entity7			1
and those are just the singers with more followers than president @entity9			1
but as the newly public social platform rolls out to investors thursday , we 're taking a look at the surprise stars of @entity3 -- the accounts you might not expect to be nestled in the top 200 most followed , alongside the likes of @entity18 and @entity19			1
some come from the ranks of the quasi-famous , those who have parlayed a smaller share of the spotlight into social media stardom through their activity on @entity3			1
others have backgrounds that have put them in the public eye in other ways			0
and some are n't people at all			0
on @entity3 , you can do that			1
maybe you 've never heard of them , or maybe you have			0
but all are examples of the power of @entity3 , when used well , to enhance celebrity and amplify one 's voice			1
here are 10 of @entity3 's most unexpected stars			1
let us know your favorite noncelebrity @entity3 celebrities in the comments			1
( note : the rankings and follower numbers used come from the tool @entity50			0
) one direction ok , this entry kind of goes against the grain of the rest			0
but we could n't figure out how @entity55 should n't be first			0
if you 're not a preteen girl , or a preteen guy who listens to music he does n't like to be around teen girls , you may well not even know that @entity55 exists			0
and the group kind of owns @entity3			1
one direction is a band of young lads from @entity64			0
they 're , by all accounts , dreamy			2
and they have six of the most popular accounts on the site			1
@entity70 @entity69 checks in at no. 22 , with 17.4 million followers -- more , even , than the 16 million following the band 's official account			1
the other four band members rank 29th , 35th , 38th and 53rd , each of them with more than 11 million followers of their own			0
in contrast , the @entity77 have the 969th most popular @entity3 account			1
of course , @entity80 does n't log on to share observations like " a little party never killed nobody , " either			0
facebook we find something amusing about the fact that @entity3 's chief rival , @entity84 , is among the top 50 most popular @entity3 accounts			1
but when you have more than 1.1 billion users , maybe it makes sense that folks want to keep up on their favorite social media site while ... well ... visiting their other favorite social media site			2
@entity84 's nearly 12 million followers put it at no. 44			1
but this interloping is nothing new			0
in the earliest days of @entity101 , @entity84 ceo @entity100 was its most popular member			1
@entity102 you would n't think a revered @entity105 novelist would be satisfied with writing 140 characters at a time			0
but @entity102 , whose 1988 novel , " @entity109 , " has sold more than 30 million copies , is an active user with more than 8.7 million followers ( no. 83 )			0
" @entity3 , i think , is an art , " @entity102 told @entity112 this year			1
" because if you 're connected to people you learn how to ( summarize )			0
@entity118 there 's probably not anyone in the world who would be more humble about having 8 million followers , right ? the exiled @entity124 spiritual leader account is no. 91 on @entity3			1
and whether he personally writes the posts or not , they come off to anyone who has heard him speak as his authentic voice and tone			0
consider this account a nice palate cleanser after reading where @entity131 went shopping last night			2
@entity133 apparently astrology is a big deal in @entity133			2
this account , which awkwardly proclaims itself " the largest astrology in the world , " has 7.2 million followers , good for no. 110 on the @entity3 list			1
as best we can tell , this is a @entity3 feed , written in @entity143 , that 's the basic equivalent of those one - line horoscopes you get in the daily paper			1
( note to fellow @entity148 : apparently , it 's ok if we 're distracted at work today			2
we might have a cold			0
) @entity152 @entity152 is famous			2
but you would n't think he 'd be this famous -- twice as many followers as @entity155			2
the @entity157 actor and writer , whose credits range from " @entity160 : a game of shadows " to cult favorites " @entity164 " and " @entity170 , " is a perfect fit for the site -- its 140 characters just enough to share his dry wit			0
or pictures of malformed @entity172			0
either way , he 's got 6.3 million followers , landing at no. 131			2
queen @entity176 " a mum and a wife with a really cool day job			2
" well , yes , if being the queen of @entity181 is a really cool day job			2
it 's not every day you find royalty on networking sites			2
but she 's answered questions from followers online and told interviewers that sites such as @entity3 can be used to achieve real social change			1
with nearly 3 million followers ( no. 456 ) , it seems to be working			0
@entity195 how does a @entity197 mom end up with 2.7 million @entity3 followers , making her account the site 's 554th most popular ? well , naming your son @entity200 helps			1
in addition to helping promote her famous son , @entity195 talks about her projects , including an autobiography , and offers encouragement to teen mothers such as herself ( she was 17 when @entity200 was born )			2
@entity208 what 's a guy got to do to crack the top 600 around here ? @entity208 was one of @entity3 's founders and has racked up 2.4 million followers			1
that only makes him no. 643 on his own site			0
( we 'd hate to think how @entity217 and @entity218 feel			0
they 've got even fewer followers			0
) the @entity221 who says good always triumphs over evil ? we scoured @entity3 for @entity224 , and the boy wizard is nowhere to be found			1
( no , the official movie account does n't count			2
) meanwhile , @entity221 is doing just fine for himself , thank you , with more than 2.2 million followers ( no. 725 )			1
this is a parody account , so there are no official ties with creator @entity232 , the books or the movies			0
but we 're ok with that			0
it lets him be even meaner .			0

the *majority* of the most - followed @entity3 accounts are singers and other celebrities
but less - famous users have *amassed* big followings as well
rival @entity84 has @entity3 's 44th most popular account
horoscopes , a queen and @entity221 also have huge followings
