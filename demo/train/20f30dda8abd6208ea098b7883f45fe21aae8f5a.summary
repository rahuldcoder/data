-- while studiously avoiding the word " torture , " cia director @entity1 told reporters on thursday that the aggressive interrogation program yielded information that helped the agency find @entity8			1
he also called the @entity10 's damning report on @entity12 abuses " flawed " by partisanship , as well as " exaggerations and misrepresentations			1
" @entity1 's comments are certain to pour oil on the already raging debate over what constitutes torture , how effective it is and who authorized what in the chaotic days and months after the 9/11 attacks			1
they also put the @entity26 administration squarely in the crossfire between @entity28 defending the committee 's handiwork and @entity31 and former @entity12 chiefs trashing it			1
the culmination of a six - year investigation , the committee @entity28 ' report was intended to provide a moment of moral reckoning for @entity38			2
instead , it has underscored @entity41 's inability to rise above partisan truths and forge a common view on how to defend the country from terrorist attacks			1
as an exercise in political accountability , a comprehensive report on the @entity12 's detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects after 9/11 is overdue			1
in its otherwise commendable zeal to avert further terrorist attacks , the agency sometimes overstepped the bounds of decency			0
" @entity63 " is how @entity1 described the behavior of what he insisted was a handful of rogue @entity12 officials who acted without authorization , and understanding how that happened is necessary to prevent it from happening again			1
yet rather than move us toward consensus on that point , the report has revealed a shockingly deep partisan divide over the morality and efficacy of torture			1
this largely reflects the @entity31 's unwillingness to confront @entity38 's faults and misdeeds			2
" i think we were fundamentally justified and i would do it again in a minute , " declared former vice president @entity77 , who continues to insist that the @entity12 did not engage in torture			1
but @entity28 , who wrote the study , also bear some responsibility for polarizing the debate			2
it is , literally , a partisan report -- none of the committee @entity31 endorsed it , and instead produced a point - by - point rebuttal			1
what 's more , the majority report 's relentlessly adversarial tone hardly seems calculated to produce the catharsis its authors say the country needs			1
still , the committee gets the biggest thing right			0
based on a huge review of 6 million @entity12 documents , it concludes the agency tortured 39 suspects at " black " sites around the world			1
the squalid details of the violence inflicted on captives ca n't be hidden behind bureaucratic euphemisms like " enhanced interrogation techniques			0
" this was torture , plain and simple			0
it violated @entity38 's professed commitment to individual dignity			0
and , by handing our enemies a propaganda windfall , it damaged our national security			0
in today 's press conference , @entity1 also clung to the fictitious distinction between " enhanced interrogation techniques , " which he said were authorized by the @entity122 administration , and torture , which was not			1
although president @entity26 prohibited the use of torture in a 2009 executive order ( as did president @entity122 in an executive order he issued in 2007 ) , sen. @entity124 , @entity125 , chairwoman of the @entity10 committee , wants @entity130 to pass fresh legislation to outlaw torture			0
she 's right , even if there 's zero chance of that happening			0
the @entity38 , after all , is still in the midst of a long , murky war with @entity138 terrorism , with no end in sight			0
the people and agencies we 've charged to wage that war deserve what they did n't get at the outset : clear legal and moral guidance to keep their conduct aligned with @entity38 's values			0
the report begins by stating categorically that torture does n't work			1
but while some intelligence experts echo this conclusion -- as does sen. @entity162 , @entity163 , whose views on the matter command respect -- many top @entity12 officials insist brutal methods did yield vital intelligence that led to the capture of major terrorist leaders and foiled several pending attacks			1
i have no way of telling who is right			0
certainly , it 's convenient to believe that torture never produces valuable information ; if true it 's purely a matter of sadism and there 's no earthly reason to condone it			2
but absolutist claims on either side strike me as implausible , and the committee might have been better off conceding that torture may have yielded important tidbits , but that they were n't worth the moral cost of betraying our own ideals and giving our enemies the idea that it 's alright to torture captured @entity38 , because we do it , too			2
the committee also did itself no favors by declining to interview former @entity12 leaders , whom @entity1 said could have provided important context that memos and papers lack			1
this puzzling omission has made it easier for @entity31 to dismiss the committee 's work as a partisan vendetta against the agency , rather than a dispassionate effort to set the historical record straight			2
that said , the report builds a persuasive case that the @entity12 routinely exaggerated the value of whatever it gleaned from physically , mentally and emotionally abusing captives			1
indeed , the most troubling thing about the study is its portrait of the @entity12 as a rogue agency running amok			2
the agency , after all , is an arm of the @entity38 government and is answerable to @entity130 and the @entity212			0
as @entity1 noted , its detention and interrogation program operated under guidance for the @entity216			2
yet the report alleges the @entity12 systematically lied to all its political overseers to shield its interrogation program from scrutiny and keep it going			1
according to the report , the agency did n't even brief the @entity122 administration on the program until 2006 ( by which time the program was winding down )			0
false , says former cia director @entity226 , who took over the @entity12 in 2006			1
president @entity122 " approved the waterboarding of @entity228 [ in 2002 ]			0
it 's in his book ! " @entity226 told reporter @entity232			0
@entity228 was the first suspect subjected to torture			0
ultimately , scapegoating the @entity12 is a little too convenient			2
it lets the @entity122 administration , which ordered an unprepared @entity12 to set up the program , off the hook			2
and in belaboring the alleged mendacity of the @entity12 , the report obscures the larger truth about the whole shameful episode : after the shock of 9/11 , the @entity12 did exactly what most @entity38 and political leaders wanted and expected it to do -- go after our enemies tong and hammer to prevent further attacks			1
they ( and we ) wanted results , and were n't too particular about how the clandestine service got them			0
in the heat of battle , the agency went too far			0
but the @entity12 is not the @entity253			2
if it erred , our political leaders ( including the intelligence committees ) erred , too , in not monitoring closely the methods it employed to keep us safe			0
now , looking back on that intense period of anger , fear and retaliatory fervor , we feel badly about what was done in our name			0
that 's the right reaction , as long we acknowledge our collective culpability , instead of pinning all the blame on the patriotic men and women we hire to do our dirty work .			0
