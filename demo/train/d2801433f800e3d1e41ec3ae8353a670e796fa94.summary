@entity0 -- @entity2 , the cantankerous political journalist whose brand of shoe - leather reporting made him a legend of the form , died on wednesday			1
@entity2 died " peacefully and quickly , " having just completed a novel , his wife , @entity7 , wrote in a note to friends			1
" he lived a marvelous , full and well loved life , " she wrote , adding : " to his many friends , he appreciated the great company , story , scoop , competition and laughter			0
he fit his life and times so very well			0
i love him and it 's been great			2
" @entity2 was a fixture on the national political scene in print and broadcast , including for @entity1 , as a political analyst beginning in the 1990s			1
a longtime newspaperman , the @entity28 native began covering national politics with the 1960 presidential election that saw @entity32 enter the @entity33			2
he spent 20 years with @entity34 , the final four as @entity0 bureau chief			2
he came to embody the persona of a grizzled , ink - stained campaign reporter , and was one of the " @entity39 " featured in @entity41 's 1973 book detailing life on the presidential campaign trail			1
in interviews , @entity2 fondly recalled covering politicians and candidates from the ground - including getting to know the subjects he was following over dinner and drinks			1
" in the old days , journalists got to know politicians better than they do now , " he told @entity51 in 2001 , describing a bygone era of occasionally meeting candidates over steak dinners , vodka martinis and late night poker games			0
" @entity2 's appetite was legendary -- for news , for stories , for food , and for washing it down , " @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity62 remembered on wednesday			1
@entity2 came to embrace the hard - charging reputation , as well as the girth that lifestyle produced , in memoirs with the titles " @entity69 in a @entity70 : forty years of @entity71 " and " fat man @entity72 : how @entity75 politics went bad			1
" " i think he was a great reporter			2
i know he was a hearty eater , and the good conversation as important as the food , " his wife wrote in her note			2
" and yes , he enjoyed extending an evening			0
he had a bold journalistic ethic , and that matters			0
" he worked for eight years with the @entity85 and , after the @entity85 folded in 1981 , moved on to the @entity0 bureau of the @entity87 with @entity88 , he wrote the syndicated " @entity90 " column for more than two decades , and he was a regular on the political panel tv show " @entity93 " in the 1980s and 1990s			2
" for @entity2 , covering politics was a calling , a passion , a profession and a full - time pastime , " said @entity94 , a former national political correspondent for @entity95 and a former senior correspondent at @entity1			1
" on the road , he was the best company -- a couple of pops , a steak and an evening of swapping stories			0
@entity2 had an extra political gene that enabled him to recognize the rogues of the political world , but he had just as much fun covering the rascals as he did the serious people , " he said			1
but as technology assumed a larger role for journalists - and campaigns began to restrict access to candidates - @entity121 grew less and less enthusiastic about the national political scene			0
" @entity125 was a great way to make a living , " he told people			0
nowadays , reporters drink white wine and eat salads			0
they go to their rooms , transcribe their notes and go to the gym			0
" @entity62 recalled that @entity2 had a " visceral disdain for cell phones and @entity139 and reporters who spent more time with their ' toys ' than wandering the back rooms of events talking and listening			1
" yet @entity2 was also known for encouraging new journalists as they joined the pack of political reporters following candidates			1
he gave @entity1 chief political analyst @entity150 her first job in journalism at the @entity85 , where he was managing editor			0
" on the campaign trail , he always took newbie reporters under his wing , and traveling with him on campaigns was a joyous way to learn @entity75 politics , " @entity150 said			2
" he loved his job and elections and reporting , and it showed in every column he wrote and every tv appearance he made			0
" @entity62 also described a man willing to encourage a new generation of campaign reporters , describing an evening at the bar of the @entity169 in @entity170 while covering the state 's first - in - the - nation presidential primary			1
" i was 24 , my first presidential campaign , and had spent the night in awe listening to @entity2 and ( fellow reporter ) @entity176 tell old stories of @entity32 and @entity178 and @entity179 , " @entity62 said			1
" ' you 're going to do ok kid , ' he said as he shuffled off to his room -- the inference being if you can close the bar with that crew you had made the right career choice			0
" @entity187 , now @entity1 's chief political correspondent , said she first saw @entity2 " in a temporary @entity33 press room in a hotel somewhere			1
" " i called a friend and said , ' i ca n't believe it			0
i 'm in the same room as @entity2 , ' " @entity187 said			1
" he was already a legend			0
i was new to everything and it seemed to me that @entity2 knew everything			1
" " i saw him many times after that in press rooms or in @entity203 or @entity170 , " she continued			0
" so many people describe him as a curmudgeon , a tough journalist with no patience for bs , particularly from politicians			0
he was all that , but the @entity2 i knew had a twinkle in his eye and was consistently sweet and kind to me			2
" people we 've lost in 2013 @entity1 's @entity217 contributed to this report .			2
