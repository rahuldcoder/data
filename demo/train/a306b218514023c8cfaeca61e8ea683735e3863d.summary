@entity0 -- a @entity3 judge revoked probation for @entity5 on wednesday after reprimanding the actress and her attorney in court for @entity5 's failure to comply with her community service			1
@entity5 was removed from the courtroom in handcuffs			1
she later posted a $ 100,000 bail and was freed early wednesday afternoon within two hours of her arrest , a @entity14 's spokeswoman said			2
under judge @entity20 's ruling , once @entity5 made bail , the actress must perform 16 hours of community service a week -- over a minimum of two days a week -- at the @entity3 morgue before her probation violation hearing november 2			1
the judge expressed anger at @entity5 's repeated probation violations the past several months			1
@entity5 was supposed to be performing community service at a downtown @entity0 women 's center , but the judge said @entity5 posted nine excused absences at the center since her last court hearing on july 21 -- and performed , at most , only two hours of service			1
@entity5 's attempt to perform community service at a nearby @entity38 facility was voided wednesday because the judge said she did n't authorize that change			1
" i am revoking her probation , " the judge said			2
@entity20 said " ms. @entity5 's decision made it deliberately impossible to perform " her community service			1
after the hearing , @entity5 publicist @entity46 released a statement : " @entity5 is hoping this matter will be resolved on november 2 and the court will reinstate probation and allow her to continue fulfilling her community service			1
" @entity5 's estranged father , @entity53 , told @entity59 's " issues with @entity60 " that his daughter needs " a very , very intensive " program of rehabilitation for substance abuse			1
" what the judge did , she had to do , " @entity53 said			2
but he said jail time would not be the proper remedy			0
" she 's not going to be working the morgue			0
she 's going to wind up in a morgue if someone does n't do something to get her help , " he said			0
@entity5 was in court wednesday so the judge could determine whether she made progress on the requirements of her probation from a shoplifting conviction earlier this year			1
in back - and - forth arguments with defense attorney @entity78 before making the ruling , the judge read aloud in court a statement that @entity5 had made regarding her unsuccessful community service at a downtown @entity0 women 's center : " she said she was n't interacting with anyone , so it was n't fulfilling			1
" the judge harshly reprimanded @entity5			1
" is that what it 's supposed to be about -- fulfilling ? or is it supposed to be punitive ? " the judge told @entity5 's attorney , who was standing beside the actress seated at the defense table			1
" her probation would have been done last year if she had done what she was supposed to do , " the judge said			2
" there has been violation after violation			0
you have been doing this a long time			0
i have been doing this a long time			0
... probation is a gift			0
it 's not a right			0
" " we all ca n't be fulfilled by what we do , " the judge added			0
her attorney responded : " she understands that			0
" " there is this rallying cry for more punishment and more jail , " her attorney said			0
the judge said , " i do n't care about rallying cries			0
" " you have n't shown me between july 21 ... and september 9 , how many hours she has done at the downtown women 's center			0
i 'm thinking maybe two -- with nine absences , " the judge said			0
" it says she blew them off and left after an hour or an hour and half			0
" at one point during the hearing , @entity0 city attorneys @entity133 and @entity135 asked the court to revoke @entity5 's probation and impose jail time because of @entity5 's failure to do the community service			1
one of the city attorneys charged in court that @entity5 " is in violation for getting herself kicked out of the women 's center , which she was ordered to do			2
" but @entity5 's attorney told the court that @entity5 received " a glowing " probation report , which said that " ms. @entity5 has reached a turning point " in her behavior and maturity			1
the judge raised several questions about the reliability of that report , however			0
@entity20 remarked how the probation report showed @entity5 had excused absences from community service between september 9 and october 5 so that @entity5 could travel to @entity160 , @entity161 , and @entity162 for work			1
but @entity5 's psychologist 's report stated that @entity5 had perfect attendance every week , the judge observed			1
" the psychologist said she appeared in person for her counseling every tuesday , " the judge said			0
" i do n't know how she did that			0
" " did she go to @entity161 for five days and come back in time or go to @entity162 for five days and come back in time ? " the judge asked the defense attorney			2
" if she was gone from september 9 to october 5 , did she get beamed across the pond ? i do n't know how that happened , " the judge said			0
@entity179 told the judge that she did n't know the specifics of @entity5 's psychological appointments , but the attorney said the arrangement did call for telephonic conferences			1
@entity179 added that @entity5 's work in @entity187 was done to support her and her family -- and impacted her ability to carry out the community service			1
" because the work is out of the county , it did cause a disruption to her schedule " to do community service , @entity179 said			1
@entity5 's community service at the county morgue wo n't be easy , as participants work eight - hour shifts at a time , the judge noted			1
" they do n't mess around and you show up and do what they tell you to do , " @entity20 said			0
in july , a court hearing revealed @entity5 was in compliance with her community service , fines and shoplifting counseling requirements , but she had not signed up for the court - ordered psychological counseling			1
her lawyer argued at the time that a lapse in @entity5 's health insurance -- because she 's not been working in the past year -- had prevented her from paying for the psychological counseling			2
@entity20 warned @entity5 that she could face jail time if she did not sign up for the counseling in three weeks			2
group counseling , which probationers attend , is often free or low - cost , but the judge agreed with her lawyer that her celebrity status made that unworkable			2
@entity5 , 25 , pleaded guilty in may to stealing a necklace from a @entity226 , @entity227 , jewelry store			2
her legal woes , which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests , have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes , and alcohol and drug test failures			0
her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless @entity5 breaks any laws before then			2
it has been extended several times because of probation violations , including the failed alcohol and drug tests			0
in june , @entity5 failed an alcohol test administered by a probation officer and was ordered to go before the judge for a probation violation hearing			1
but her attorney convinced the judge the testing requirement had lapsed in february			0
earlier this year , the judge ruled that she is now allowed to drink alcohol and is no longer required to take random drug tests .			0

@entity5 must now do community service in @entity3 morgue two days a week
@entity5 is free on bail and hopes to have her probation reinstated , her publicist says
her father says she needs " very , very intensive " rehabilitation
a judge *rovokes* the actress ' probation , and she is led away in handcuffs
