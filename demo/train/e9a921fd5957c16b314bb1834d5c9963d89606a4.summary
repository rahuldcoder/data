@entity0 has long fought a losing battle against commuters who stubbornly ride on train roofs to beat the rush hour			1
but railway officials say they have found the perfect deterrent , concrete balls , suspended on chains from a steel frame , just 25 cm or 10 inches , above any passing train			1
dubbed " @entity11 " , they are about 10 cm or 4 inches in diameter and are painted silver			0
twenty four , a dozen on each side , are suspended from a frame that looks like a soccer goal			1
the first one was installed early this week , a few hundred yards from a train station , just outside @entity21			1
anyone riding on the roof will find it hard to dodge the balls			1
@entity26 , a spokesman for the state - owned railway company @entity27 , told @entity28 no one has dared an attempt it			2
" from our field reports so far , there have been no roof riders on that line since we installed them , " @entity26 said			2
over the years , officials have tried and failed to stop commuters from climbing atop carriages			2
" policing passengers has been going on in various ways for so long			0
starting with oil on the roof , using barbed wire , spraying dyed water , dogs , advice from religious leaders			0
none of these were effective , " explained @entity26			0
some critics say this latest tactic seemed too extreme			0
" it 's not that we do not have humanity , but from the time someone gets up on the top of the train , they just do not value their life anymore , " @entity26 added			0
almost half a million commuters depend on the railway system to travel within the greater @entity21 area			1
trains are packed , especially during the rush hours			2
many passengers choose to climb to the top of overcrowded carriages			0
there are some -- train surfers -- who get on for a free ride or just for the thrill of it			0
officials say these thrill rides cause one or two deaths per month			0
they hope the new measure will prevent any more fatal accidents			0
if the concrete balls prove to be effective , more will be installed in other areas of the capital , officials said			1
the government predicts that by 2018 , the number of train passengers in @entity21 will increase to over a million			1
everyone here agrees that what this growing metropolis needs is an improved and expanded railway system that gives passengers no excuse to get on train rooftops .			1
