-- on the eve of his second inaugural , president @entity1 appears smarter , tougher and bolder than ever before			1
but whether he is also wiser remains a key question for his new term			2
it is clear that he is consciously changing his leadership style heading into the next four years			0
weeks before the november elections , his top advisers were signaling that he intended to be a different kind of president in his second term			0
" just watch , " they said to me , in effect , " he will win re-election decisively and then he will throw down the gauntlet to the @entity16 , insisting they raise taxes on the wealthy			1
right on the edge of the fiscal cliff , he thinks @entity16 will cave			1
" what 's your @entity22 , i asked			0
" we do n't need a @entity22 , " they answered			0
" after the president hangs tough -- no more mr. @entity27 -- the other side will buckle			0
" sure enough , @entity16 caved on taxes			1
encouraged , @entity1 has since made clear he wo n't compromise with @entity16 on the debt ceiling , either			1
foreman : my last letter to the president @entity1 2.0 stepped up this past week on yet another issue : gun control			1
no president in two decades has been as forceful or sweeping in challenging the nation 's gun culture			0
once again , he portrayed the right as the enemy of progress and showed no interest in negotiating a package up front			0
in his coming @entity44 address , and perhaps in his inaugural , the president will begin a hard push for a comprehensive reform of our tattered immigration system			0
leading @entity16 leaders on the issue -- sen. @entity53 , @entity54 , for example -- would prefer a piecemeal approach that is bipartisan			1
@entity1 wants to go for broke in a single package , and on a central issue -- providing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented residents -- he is uncompromising			1
after losing out on getting @entity61 as his next secretary of state , @entity1 has also shown a tougher side on personnel appointments			1
@entity65 went down after @entity66 as well as @entity16 senators indicated a preference for sen. @entity69			1
but when @entity16 also tried to kill the nomination of @entity74 for secretary of defense , @entity1 was unyielding -- an " in - your - face appointment , " sen. @entity70 , @entity72 - @entity71 , called it , echoing sentiments held by some of his colleagues			1
will @entity1 's second inauguration let @entity82 turn the page ? republicans would have preferred someone other than @entity86 at @entity87 , but @entity1 brushed them off			1
@entity88 and @entity86 -- both substantial men -- will be confirmed , absent an unexpected bombshell , and @entity1 will rack up two more victories over @entity16			1
strikingly , @entity1 has also been deft in the ways he has drawn upon vice president @entity93			1
during much of the campaign , @entity93 appeared to be kept under wraps			0
but in the transition , he has been invaluable to @entity1 in negotiating a deal with @entity99 minority leader @entity98 on the fiscal cliff and in pulling together the gun package			1
@entity93 was also at his most eloquent at the ceremony announcing the gun measures			0
all of this has added up for @entity1 to one of the most effective transitions in modern times			1
and it is paying rich dividends : a @entity0 poll this past week pegged his approval rating at 55 % , far above the doldrums he was in for much of the past two years			0
many of his long - time supporters are rallying behind him			0
as the first @entity119 since @entity116 to score back - to - back election victories with more than 50 % of the vote , @entity1 is in the strongest position since early in his first year			2
smarter , tougher , bolder -- his new style is paying off politically			1
but in the long run , will it also pay off in better governance ? perhaps -- and for the country 's sake , let 's hope so			0
yet , there are ample reasons to wonder , and worry			0
@entity130 : @entity16 's surprising edge on diversity ultimately , to resolve major issues like deficits , immigration , guns and energy , the president and @entity139 need to find ways to work together much better than they did in the first term			1
over the past two years , @entity16 were clearly more recalcitrant than @entity66 , practically declaring war on @entity1 , and the @entity144 has been right to adopt a tougher approach after the elections			1
but a growing number of @entity16 concluded after they had their heads handed to them in november that they had to move away from extremism toward a more center - right position , more open to working out compromises with @entity1			1
it 's not that they suddenly wanted @entity1 to succeed ; they did n't want their party to fail			2
house speaker @entity154 led the way , offering the day after the election to raise taxes on the wealthy and giving up two decades of @entity16 orthodoxy			1
in a similar spirit , @entity53 has been developing a mainstream plan on immigration , moving away from a ruinous @entity16 stance			2
one senses that the hope , small as it was , to take a brief timeout on hyperpartisanship in order to tackle the big issues is now slipping away			0
@entity169 : second - term @entity1 will play defense while a majority of @entity82 now approve of @entity1 's job performance , conservatives increasingly believe that in his new toughness , he is going overboard , trying to run over them			1
they do n't see a president who wants to roll up his sleeves and negotiate ; they see a president who wants to barnstorm the country to beat them up			0
news that @entity1 is converting his campaign apparatus into a nonprofit to support his second term will only deepen that sense			2
and it frustrates them that he is winning : at their retreat , @entity144 @entity16 learned that their disapproval has risen to 64 %			2
conceivably , @entity1 's tactics could pressure republicans into capitulation on several fronts			2
more likely , they will be spoiling for more fights			0
chances for a " grand bargain " appear to be hanging by a thread			0
two suspicions are starting to float among those with distaste for the president			0
the first is that he is n't really all that committed to bringing deficits under control			0
if he were , he would be pushing a master plan by now			0
instead , it is argued , he will tinker with the deficits but cares much more about leaving a progressive legacy -- health care reform , a stronger safety net , green energy , and the like			0
politics : second inaugural address puts @entity1 in select company second , the suspicion is taking hold that he is approaching the second term with a clear eye on elections ahead			2
what if he can drive @entity16 out of control of the @entity144 in 2014 ? then he could get his real agenda done			2
what if he could set the stage for another @entity119 to win the presidency in 2016 ? then he could leave behind a majority coalition that could run the country for years , just as @entity116 did			0
democrats , of course , think the real point is that @entity1 is finally showing the toughness that is needed			2
we are surely seeing a new @entity1 emerge on the eve of his second term			2
where he will now lead the country is the central question that his inaugural address and the weeks ahead will begin to answer			0
will you be attending president @entity1 's inauguration weekend ? be a part of @entity239 and @entity241 's special inauguration project ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			1

@entity244 : since re-election , @entity1 seems smarter , tougher , bolder
he says president *outmanuevered* *opponents* on taxes , key appointments
did @entity1 miss an opportunity to work *cooperatively* with @entity16 , @entity244 asks
@entity244 : conservatives fear @entity1 is trying to run over them
