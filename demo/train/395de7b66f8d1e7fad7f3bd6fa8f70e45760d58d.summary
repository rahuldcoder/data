-- a @entity3 @entity2 bomber , likely the last of its kind , has been raised from the bottom of the @entity7 and will be restored for display in a @entity10 museum			1
" it has been lifted and is now safely on the barge and in one piece , " @entity11 , a spokesman for @entity12 , told the @entity13			0
the @entity16 shot down the @entity18 twin - engine medium bomber of the @entity2 @entity19 on august 26 , 1940 , during the @entity20			1
it was one of 1,500 built by @entity2 and the last known to be in existence , according to the @entity12			1
@entity2 employed more than 400 dornier 17s during the @entity20 , and 200 of those were lost			1
most wrecks were melted down and recycled into making planes and armaments for @entity10 , according to the museum			0
the plane raised monday was damaged in a battle with @entity33 fighters as it tried to attack airfields in @entity36 , the museum said			2
its pilot made a belly landing on @entity39 in the channel off @entity41 , and the plane sank upside down in about 50 feet of water			1
the pilot and another crew member who survived the crash were taken prisoner and sent to prisoner - of - war camps in @entity49 , the museum said			2
two other crew members died			0
the plane remained undisturbed on the floor of the @entity7 until divers spotted it in 2008			1
" the aircraft is in remarkable condition -- considering the events surrounding its loss plus the effects of spending so many years under water , " the museum 's website says			0
" other than marine concretion it is largely intact , the main undercarriage tires remain inflated and the propellers clearly show the damage inflicted during their final landing			2
" the museum then stepped in with a nearly million - dollar effort ( about 600,000 pounds ) to raise the craft and launch a restoration project			0
" the discovery of the @entity74 is of national and international importance			0
the aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the @entity20			2
it is particularly significant because , as a bomber , it formed the heart of the @entity19 assault and the subsequent blitz , " @entity78 , director general of the @entity12 , says on the museum 's website			0
" the @entity74 will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the @entity20 and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces and from many nations , " @entity78 says on the website			1
once the plane is ashore , it will be soaked in a citric acid solution to stop corrosion , the first step in a restoration process expected to take two years			0
the plane then will go on display at the @entity12 in north @entity101			0
