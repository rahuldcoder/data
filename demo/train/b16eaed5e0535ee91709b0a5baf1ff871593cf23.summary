-- leaping from rooftops and doing backflips off walls is when prince @entity4 feels the most free			1
the 25 - year - old from @entity6 is one of the city 's small band of freerunners , who take every opportunity to practice parkour in a city striving for normality and currently facing a resurgence of deadly violence			1
" when i do parkour , i get rid of all the scattered thoughts in my head and empty all the anger from inside me , " said @entity4			1
from the streets of @entity23 in the 1990s , where parkour was first popularized , to @entity26 park in @entity28 's capital , freerunning has become a global phenomenon			1
the sport evolved from @entity32 military training and involves running through urban environments using only the body to overcome obstacles and objects			0
in @entity6 , the challenges are even greater than in other cities			2
@entity4 says his fellow freerunners have to contend with a public unsure of what to make of a group running and leaping through the city 's largest public park			1
there is also the threat of bomb attacks and indiscriminate violence in the city			0
" it is dangerous and it is difficult to practice parkour anywhere , " he says			2
" sometimes we are exposed to arrested or misunderstanding from some people and there is the deteriorating security situation			0
" but despite these challenges , @entity4 is committed to improving in his sport , and teaching its benefits to others			2
he was first turned on to freerunning in 2007 when he watched the film " @entity64 " that featured parkour in many of its stunt sequences			2
inspired , he sought out internet clips of the sport in order to learn parkour techniques			1
" we are a small group of young people and there are no parkour classes , " he says , noting that the group -- aged between 18 and 25 -- support and teach each other , going as far as pooling their money to rent a gym			0
" it 's small and does not meet the purpose , " he says			0
" it 's very far from our homes , but despite of all these difficult circumstances we go			0
" " i love parkour because this sport is the art of movement and freedom and this art has made me know true freedom in this difficult life			0
