he would often be seen driving down the road with a wild animal			0
" my cats are happier than most people , " @entity1 once told the @entity43			1
" i feed them every day , and they have a great place to live			0
how many people can say they have all they can eat and do n't have to worry about a place to live ? " in a 2008 video in @entity52 , @entity1 is seen smiling , holding a cub and handing it over to model @entity7			2
" we heard about @entity1 from all of his work in movies and commercials and felt he had a great track record			2
the day of our shoot , he was very kind , loving and protective towards his animals , " said @entity59 , the head of the @entity61 tv - station @entity60 in charge of the shoot			0

sheriff @entity103 defended his officers , saying they had no choice but to kill the roaming animals			0
" i had deputies that had to shoot animals with sidearms at close range			0
that 's how volatile this situation was			0
" @entity1 was known as a flamboyant , volatile man			2
the sheriff 's department had been to the property on dozens of occasions over the last decade to check into reports of animal cruelty or animals on the loose			1
@entity1 would stare down those who entered his property with his steely blue eyes			1
he 'd cuss and scream			2
" i 'll be damned , " @entity1 would shout , according to county humane officer @entity124			2
" i 'll let them animals go ! " " he was definitely a different breed , " said @entity124 , who investigates every case of animal cruelty in the county			1
" we were just afraid that this was going to happen			0
it was n't a matter of if it was going to happen , it was a matter of when			0
" @entity124 said @entity1 would often buy his exotic animals from people in other states and offer to host them on his property for vacation			1
" they 'd visit and see the situation and they 'd freak out and they 'd call me , " he said			0
" they 'd say , ' i was horrified			0
' " in the last year , even while @entity1 was imprisoned on the weapons charges , @entity124 said he got at least one call a month about animals roaming loose			1
every time he visited @entity1 's farm , @entity124 was escorted by at least three sheriff 's deputies because he feared for his safety			1
he said local authorities had alerted the @entity154 @entity153 , state representatives and other power players about their fears concerning @entity1 and his wild animals			1
" and now we 're dealing with this			0
" @entity8 with the @entity9 said @entity1 was an animal collector who had a horrible reputation for the treatment of his animals			1
opinion : wild animals should be left in the wild " it 's been a nightmare out there for a decade , " @entity8 said			0

but i knew eventually something bad would happen out there			0
" @entity8 said @entity1 would bring his wild animals to the shelter 's annual pet fair , where people bring their dogs and cats			1
@entity1 showed up once with bear cubs , once with tiger cubs and another time with a baby ape			2
children would rush toward the exotic animals			2
" the animals were growling and snarling back at the children , " @entity8 said			2
every year , officials would ask @entity1 to leave the fair			1
he 'd argue it was his right to bring his animals			2
it got so testy that officials eventually changed the rules just to keep @entity1 and his animals away			1
now , only domestic house pets are welcome			0
@entity124 and @entity8 said officials had tried to get state and federal authorities to take control of the animals while @entity1 was imprisoned in the last year			1
" we were trying and trying to get help , " @entity124 said			0
" hopefully a tragedy like this will get the ball rolling with the state of @entity2 and the ownership of exotic animals			0
" the laws are so weak in @entity2 , it 's ridiculous			0
you can have one permit and pretty much have all the exotic animals you want			0
" added @entity8 : " for me the sad part of this is that the court system could 've removed those animals , and it 's really sad it reached this point			0
" the @entity216 urged @entity2 officials wednesday to issue an emergency rule to crack down on exotic animal ownership			0
a previous emergency order issued by then - gov. @entity221 that prohibited people convicted of animal cruelty from owning exotic animals expired in april			1
the @entity225 said @entity1 " would almost certainly have had his animals removed by may 1 , 2011 , if the emergency order had not expired			1
" when he was first sentenced to animal cruelty charges in 2005 , @entity1 told the judge : " i 've learned a lot from this case , and i do love my animals			1
