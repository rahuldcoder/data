@entity0 -- @entity2 faces a test of unity over the coming months as regional elections in @entity6 and @entity7 threaten to destabilize the debt - ridden nation			1
with unemployment at a record 25 % , borrowing costs spiraling and debt repayments looming , @entity2 is emerging as the possible next candidate to tap its eurozone peers for financial help			2
but @entity2 stands apart from other nations forced to seek aid			2
as the eurozone 's fourth largest economy -- making up around 11 % of the currency bloc 's gross domestic product -- its financial problems are now being exacerbated by defiance from some of its 17 disparate regions			0
@entity6 , a semi-autonomous region in the @entity26 , represents one fifth of @entity2 's economy and the protestors are now actively calling for a split from central government			1
such agitations -- coming as they are in the midst of the country 's debt crisis -- threaten to undermine @entity37 's attempts to pull @entity2 from its financial mire			2
@entity39 , managing director of @entity40 told @entity1 that the sub sovereign debt problems are a " hot button issue			0
" for @entity37 , the push back " accentuates [ the problems ] , making it more likely @entity2 will be forced to call on the @entity44 [ @entity46 's permanent bailout fund ] , " @entity39 said			1
but @entity48 , a @entity46 analyst at @entity49 , told @entity1 that despite the protests the likelihood of a @entity6 separation is " extremely low			1
" according to @entity48 , the ruling political party in @entity6 , @entity54 ( @entity54 ) led by @entity6 president @entity55 , has used the eurozone debt crisis and regional elections set for november 25 to openly call for sovereignty			1
@entity48 said : " it is true that public support for independence has been on the rise			0
but the @entity6 government is implementing very tough financial adjustments and therefore the [ @entity6 ] president , @entity55 , is capitalizing on nationalist sentiments to shift the burden of responsibility onto the central government			1
" last week @entity55 met with the @entity37 in @entity69 to try and negotiate a new fiscal arrangement , whereby @entity6 would manage its own taxes and transfer less money to other regions in @entity2			1
even as @entity6 -- with its own language and culture -- strives for autonomy , in august , the @entity54 requested a 5 billion euro ( $ 6.3 billion ) bailout from the @entity2 government			1
the request came after @entity37 announced plans for a credit line to be extended to @entity2 's 17 regions			0
but , according to @entity48 , @entity6 is not @entity37 's main concern			0
instead @entity2 's leader is focusing on regional elections in @entity7 in october -- a region in @entity88 - western @entity2 -- where his party is likely to win and where the policies could create a model for the rest of @entity2			1
@entity48 said : " the key area for @entity37 is @entity7 because his party has an absolute majority			0
he wants to use @entity7 as an example of how his policies are working because it is one of the healthiest region in fiscal terms			0
" @entity2 has already requested up to a 100 billion euro ( $ 128 billion ) aid package for its ailing banks , which are still struggling to grapple with the property collapse in 2008			1
pressure from @entity46 partners and investor fear over further credit downgrades for @entity2 could undo the calming effect of @entity110 president @entity109 's announcement on september 6			2
@entity109 said the bank would be willing to purchase sovereign bonds of fiscally - frail countries such as @entity2 and @entity114 , if these indebted nations request a bailout			2
but @entity48 noted it was difficult to place a time frame on @entity2 seeking any external aid			0
he added : " for @entity37 , he has said ' only if market pressure increases ' and you see how yields are going up again			0
i think market pressure is the ultimate factor that would cause @entity37 to apply			0

@entity6 has requested a 5 billion euro ( $ 6.3 billion ) bailout from the @entity2 government
@entity7 and @entity6 will hold regional elections in october and november respectively
investors are wary that @entity2 could soon need financial support from @entity46 bailout funds
