-- picture this scene : an @entity2 resting on a table with the familiar @entity5 image from a video call on the screen			2
the flat display shows your caller 's upper body , talking away			2
but below this their hands and arms reach up out of the tabletop into the physical world , gently lifting a small red ball off the table and passing it from one digitally - recreated hand to the other			1
it 's the work of the @entity23 : a tabletop covered in miniature white squares that rise up like towers , to turn digital content into physical objects			1
used in conjunction with a 3d sensor , like @entity33 's @entity32 , it can capture a person 's physical appearance and reproduce it in tiny skyscraper - like " pixel " blocks -- on - the - fly , anywhere in the world			1
" essentially it 's very similar to those kind of pin toys that you might know from museum novelty stores , " explains @entity42 's @entity41 , part of the @entity44 behind the @entity23			1
similar -- yes -- just a lot more impressive			0
to add color to the block shapes , a projector on the ceiling beams down light , turning the towers psychedelic hues as @entity41 demonstrates the table 's capabilities			2
it also has a deeper purpose -- communicating an extra layer of information from the sender to the receiver on the other end : " when you move your hands , not only do you have the shape of the hands , but you also see the color , the texture of the hands , " says @entity41			2
@entity41 shows off a couple of the table 's party tricks : sculpting a model car from the blocks , coloring it in , and video - chatting about it with a colleague -- allowing them both to get hands - on with the model , regardless of physical distance			1
the display doubles as an active controller , allowing a user to interact with @entity88 menus constructed by the table by moving the little red ball			1
" it 's not real 3d because we can only push up and down each one of these pins , " says @entity41			0
" we ca n't push them sideways or have any other control over them at the moment -- we usually call this affect ' 2.5d ' " even so , the @entity23 's remarkable capabilities seem to given some users big ideas			1
" a lot of comments we get are like -- ' oh , it 's like a super power ' , " he laughs			0
they say it feels like being @entity111 nemesis @entity110 , he explains -- suddenly having the power to manipulate the world at a distance , just with a wave of your hand			0
for @entity41 , his ambitions are a little more down to earth			0
" in the future , where we hope to get is something like , say , a phone that you could have in your pocket , and as you interact with things on the phone you can actually touch them			0
" it remains to be seen whether or not users will be excited about a smartphone that can poke them back			0
@entity41 , for one , has a good feeling about it .			0

the @entity23 is a table that can render 3d content physically
using a @entity32 sensor , users can create a 3d likeness of their hands
the display can also be used as a controller
