-- @entity3 has more uranium enrichment facilities than it has admitted to previously , a @entity2 scientist charged thursday			2
prof. @entity5 of @entity6 told @entity0 his conclusion is based on his study of recent satellite images and other research , and what he saw when he was invited by @entity3 to visit its @entity13 nuclear power plant in 2010 to see its secret uranium enrichment program			1
" when i saw the sophistication and scale of that uranium enrichment facility at @entity13 in a building that i had been in before that housed something totally different , it was clear that they started the program long before the time that they had said , which was april 2009			2
so my conclusion was , they had to have another site someplace else , " said @entity5			0
the @entity6 scientist visited @entity13 in november , 2010 , and reported that he saw a facility that housed 2,000 centrifuges and was producing low - enriched uranium			1
it could , however , he wrote then , " be readily converted to produce highly - enriched uranium ( @entity36 ) bomb fuel			0
" @entity5 , an emeritus director of @entity37 , also estimated that @entity3 has between four and eight plutonium bombs , each of which could do damage similiar to that of the atomic bomb dropped on @entity44 in @entity45 at the end of @entity47 he is in @entity48 attending international nuclear conferences ahead of the @entity50 next week			1
@entity3 , although not officially on the agenda , will be discussed in bilateral meetings at the summit , which will be attended by more than 50 heads of state , including @entity2 president @entity55			0
@entity5 's assessment comes just weeks after the @entity2 agreed to a deal with @entity3 in which @entity58 would allow @entity60 weapons inspectors back into the country in exchange for food aid			1
@entity3 ejected inspectors from the @entity60 's @entity65 from its @entity13 nuclear complex in april 2009 , about a month before it conducted its second nuclear weapons test			1
however , per the new agreement , the inspectors will only have access to the sites to which @entity3 has admitted having , not the ones @entity5 suspects are still undisclosed			1
as part of the deal , @entity58 also agreed to refrain from nuclear tests and long - range missile tests , but just last week announced it would launch a rocket with a satellite attached in mid-april			2
" i was n't so surprised that they would do a space launch , " said @entity5 , who is also the co-director of the @entity79			0
" what i was surprised at is , first of all they even agreed to a missile moratorium but then immediately turned around to say , ' we 're doing this space launch ' and quite frankly , that makes a mockery of the agreement			0
" @entity3 says it has a right to a peaceful space program and invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch , the state - run @entity90 said last week			0
the satellite would be sent into orbit in mid-april to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity100 , @entity3 's founder and current leader @entity102 's grandfather .			0

@entity5 visited the @entity13 nuclear plant in 2010
the scientists estimates @entity3 has as many as 8 plutonium bombs
@entity58 recently agreed to allow inspectors back in in exchange for food aid
it also agreed to halt nuclear and missile testing
