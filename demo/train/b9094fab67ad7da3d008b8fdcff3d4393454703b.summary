@entity0 -- president @entity2 sought to link the past and future on monday in his second inaugural address , tying the nation 's founding principles to the challenges confronting his second term in a call for @entity11 to fulfill the responsibility of citizenship			1
eschewing poetic language for rhetorical power , @entity2 cited the accomplishments of the past four years while laying out a progressive agenda for the next four that would tackle thorny issues like gun control , climate change and immigration reform			1
" we have always understood that when times change , so must we ; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges ; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action , " he said			0
" my fellow @entity11 , we are made for this moment and we will seize it so long as we seize it together , " he added later			0
analysts called the speech politically astute and an important expression of new forcefulness by the president as he enters his second term following re-election last november			1
" it 's a real declaration of conscience , about principles , about what he believes in , " said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity40			1
" he basically said , ' when i came in the first term , we had all these emergencies , we had these wars			0
we 've now started to clear the decks			0
let 's talk about what 's essential			1
' " @entity2 speech addresses social justice movements the foundation of the address , and @entity2 's vision for the future , were the tenets he quoted from the @entity59 -- " that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness			1
" " today , we continue a never - ending journey , to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time , " @entity2 said to gathered dignitaries and flag - waving throngs on the @entity69			2
" for history tells us that while these truths may be self - evident , they have never been self - executing ; that while freedom is a gift from @entity80 , it must be secured by his people here on @entity83			0
" in particularly pointed references , the president made a forceful call for gay rights that equated the issue with the struggle for women 's rights in the 19th century and civil rights in the 1960s			1
" we , the people , declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still ; just as it guided our forebears through @entity102 , and @entity103 , and @entity104 , " @entity2 said , mentioning landmarks of the women 's , black and gay rights movements			1
" it is now our generation 's task to carry on what those pioneers began , " he continued , prompting the loudest applause and cheers of his address when he said " our journey is not complete until our wives , our mothers , and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts			2
" opinion : 11 views on @entity2 's speech more cheers came when @entity2 called for " our gay brothers and sisters " to be treated " like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well			1
" according to observers , it was the first time a president championed gay marriage in an inaugural address			1
with further mention of topical issues such as immigration reform and gun control , @entity2 came to his key point -- that adhering to @entity11 's bedrock principles requires taking action on today 's challenges			1
" being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life ; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way , or follow the same precise path to happiness , " he said			0
" progress does not compel us to settle centuries - long debates about the role of government for all time -- but it does require us to act in our time			0
" a deep partisan divide in @entity0 and the country characterized @entity2 's first term , with @entity158 seemingly paralyzed at times and repeated episodes of brinksmanship over debt and spending issues bringing the first - ever downgrade of the @entity11 credit rating			1
acknowledging the political rift , @entity2 called for leaders and citizens to work for the greater good of the country			2
" we can not mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat name - calling as reasoned debate , " he said			0
" we must act , knowing that our work will be imperfect			0
" at the same time , he made clear he would fight for the central themes of his election campaign			2
" for we , the people , understand that our country can not succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it , " he said			0
while " we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit , " he said , " we reject the belief that @entity11 must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future			0
" text of speech in particular , he defended the need for popular entitlement programs that provide government benefits to senior citizens , the poor and the disabled , saying they were part of the @entity11 fabric			0
" the commitments we make to each other -- through @entity205 , and @entity206 , and @entity207 -- these things do not sap our initiative ; they strengthen us , " @entity2 said			2
" they do not make us a nation of takers ; they free us to take the risks that make this country great			0
" on monday , @entity217 @entity216 leader @entity215 , one of @entity2 's harshest critics , called the president 's second term " a fresh start when it comes to dealing with the great challenges of our day ; particularly , the transcendent challenge of unsustainable federal spending and debt			1
" other issues also appear difficult , if not intractable			0
@entity2 made a reference to gun control , saying that the nation needed to ensure that " all our children , from the streets of @entity233 to the hills of @entity235 to the quiet lanes of @entity237 , know that they are cared for , and cherished , and always safe from harm			2
" however , congressional @entity216 and some @entity239 , as well as the powerful gun lobby , have rejected proposals @entity2 recently announced in response to the @entity244 school shootings that killed 20 @entity237 first - graders last month			2
in citing climate change as a priority , @entity2 raised the profile of the issue on the national agenda after a presidential campaign in which it was almost never mentioned			1
" we will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations , " he said , warning of a " long and sometimes difficult " path to sustainable energy sources in a nation dominated by its fossil fuel industries such as oil and coal			1
" @entity11 can not resist this transition ; we must lead it , " @entity2 said			2
" we can not cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries -- we must claim its promise			0
" @entity2 infused his speech with references to two assassinated @entity11 icons -- president @entity275 and civil rights leader @entity274 in one passage , @entity2 cited " blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword " in mentioning the @entity281 and slavery			1
it mimicked @entity275 's second inaugural address in 1865 , when he spoke of the possibility that " every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn the sword			1
" of @entity274 , @entity2 referred to those who came to @entity0 almost 50 years ago " to hear a preacher say that we can not walk alone ; to hear a @entity274 proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on @entity83			2
" the inauguration coincided with the national holiday honoring @entity274			0
the president concluded by urging @entity11 to fulfill their responsibility as citizens by meeting " the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast , but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals			0
" at a little more than 2,100 words , @entity2 's speech was about 300 shorter than his first inaugural address four years earlier			1
in 2009 , he was fresh off his historic election as the nation 's first @entity312 - @entity11 president , facing an economic recession , wars in @entity316 and @entity317 and the ongoing terrorist threat			2
@entity319 , author of the book " @entity2 : @entity324 , " said the difference from four years ago was palpable , adding : " i could feel his heart beating this time			0
" @entity325 : top 5 inaugural addresses @entity1 's @entity327 and @entity328 contributed to this report .			0
