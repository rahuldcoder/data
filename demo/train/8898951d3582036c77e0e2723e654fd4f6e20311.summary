@entity0 , @entity1 -- facebook updates and @entity7 videos are becoming more important to global affairs than governments , @entity4 's president said this week			1
" this so - called social media has transformed our democratic institutions in such a way that what takes place in the more traditional institutions of power -- congress , ministries , even the @entity21 or the presidency and the cabinet in my country -- has become almost a sideshow , " @entity10 , @entity4 's president , said in an interview with @entity2 on thursday at the @entity13 conference here in coastal @entity1			1
" i know it 's a strong statement , especially coming from someone who spent most of his life within those institutions			2
but the power of the social media is , in my opinion , transforming the political process in such a way that i ca n't see any chance for the traditional , formal institutions of our democratic systems to keep up			1
" the statement comes after years of hardship for @entity4 , which suffered the collapse of its financial system in 2008 and a massive 2010 volcano eruption that shut down international travel in the region			2
the country saw widespread political protests during this period , leading @entity10 to say @entity4 was the example that @entity53 and now the global @entity55 movements followed			1
@entity10 , an even - spoken figure with @entity58 hair and a charming @entity60 accent , said protests organized by social media and technological developments are healthy for society , whether or not that offers him much in the way of job security			1
he sees technological development as a way to move @entity4 forward after tragedy			2
" @entity70 was always important to people in @entity4 and a literary creativity , " he said			2
" somehow , with the digital revolution , this interest was transported over to computers , websites , mobile phones and so on			0
so @entity4 now ranks among the top countries in all of these areas , and it has brought forward a new generation of people who are creating companies in these fields			2
" the country has rebounded significantly since the 2008 meltdown , he said , and that 's because @entity4 bucked the advice of the international community and decided not to bail out the banks and financial institutions that helped create the foreclosure crisis			1
" we are coming out of this crisis earlier and more effectively than i think anyone , including ourselves , could have expected			0
@entity4 is now serving as an interesting example of how you can get out of a very deep financial and economic crisis			2
" @entity4 's unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 % in the third financial quarter of this year , down from 8.5 % earlier this year			1
the @entity102 ' unemployment rate is higher , at 9.1 % , but @entity4 's unemployment rate is still up compared to pre-crisis levels , which hovered around 2 % to 4 % in 2006 and 2007			1
a creative spirit helped the country recover , as former bankers found new jobs in other industries that are , on the whole , more helpful for the country , he said			0
" one of the lessons is that if you want to grow your economy towards the creative direction of the 21st century , a big banking sector , even if it is successful , is in fact bad news , " he said			0
@entity4 is also trying to develop itself as a hub for @entity122 traffic			1
@entity10 says new data centers -- the computer warehouses that essentially house the @entity122 -- are coming to @entity4 because they can be powered by clean energy , and because the country is a smart linking point between @entity128 and @entity129			1
underwater broadband cables connect the island nation to both of those continents			0
" the climate in @entity4 is such that if you want to cool the storage center , to put it simply , you open a window , " he said , " whereas 40 % of the data center 's running costs in other locations is spent on air conditioning			1
so the operation is much cheaper in @entity4			0
" he 's also using the @entity122 to promote tourism in his country			0
a video posted on the site @entity147 shows the president sitting behind a wooden desk and inviting anyone who will listen to come to his house for " delicious pancakes			0
" " it 's a great idea because it also displays that the essence of @entity4 society is openness and friendliness , " he said			1
" it 's one of those countries that 's still assuming that anyone who come comes as a friend until proven otherwise , whereas most of the world is moving in a different direction -- assuming everyone is a threat , until proven otherwise			0
" the offer for presidential pancakes , by the way , is still on the table for those who act fast ; and he 'll serve them just the way his grandmother did , " with cream and jam			0
" " i 'm not going to open a pancake restaurant , " he said , laughing			0
" i 'm just going to do it on a smaller scale			0

@entity4 's president : social media is more powerful than government
president : " i ca n't see any chance for traditional *...* institutions to keep up "
@entity10 also hopes to develop @entity4 as an internet hub
the country is courting data centers , which house the internet
