what sparked the frenzy this time ? a list of five cool destinations for airplane geeks and roto heads -- um , i mean aviation enthusiasts			1

everyone has their own list , as shown by @entity0 commenters who wrote questions like , " what about @entity23 ? " " do n't forget @entity21			1
" " hey , check out what they have at @entity27 's @entity26			1
" their energy and excitement punched through the page , proof of the passion that powers aviation fans , including the closet geeks who fly under the radar			2
related story : these people really love to fly @entity40 some of the comments yielded the unexpected			1
about three hours southeast of @entity43 , there 's a big surprise in the tiny town of @entity46 , @entity40 -- population 11,417			1
@entity0 commenter lastdomino pointed out @entity49 as an " off - the beaten path gem			1
" indeed you are correct , lastdomino ! this gem has three aircraft crown jewels : -- an f - 102 variant trainer jet called the @entity55 that was flown by a young @entity56 by the name of @entity58 , according to museum officials			1
-- a sharp @entity61 fighter plane that the museum says was formerly piloted by some guy named @entity64			1
later , he went on to be the first man to walk on the moon			0
-- a @entity70 - era @entity69 bomber named @entity71 , which you may have already seen -- if you 've ever watched the classic 1970 film " @entity75			0
" " if you 're ever close ... definitely worth the trip , " lastdomino wrote			0
the place where dead airplanes come back to life @entity82 to the east of @entity40 near @entity84 , @entity82 , lies the aviation museum that rivals the @entity86 , and which some say surpasses it			1
an avalanche of @entity0 comments raved about the @entity90 , which is sometimes mistakenly referred to as @entity91 air force museum because of its location at @entity91			1
not to oversell it , but this place bills itself as " the world 's largest and oldest military aviation museum			2
" @entity0 commenter @entity97 showed his enthusiasm when he wrote : " you need to get to the presidential exhibit hangar at the @entity90 in @entity84 to see the cool stuff			2
we 've been everywhere else , like @entity103 [ @entity104 ] and @entity105 , [ aka @entity106 ] , but this hangar is mecca for all true believers in the @entity110			0
" the star of the exhibit @entity97 is referring to is a @entity113 called @entity114 ( @entity115 ) 26000			0
it 's safe to say this is one of the most historic aircraft in the world			2
it 's the jet that served as @entity121 for president @entity123 's 1963 trip to @entity124 , where he made his famous " @entity126 " speech			2
it 's the aircraft where @entity127 took the presidential oath of office after @entity123 was assassinated in @entity130			2
it 's the plane that ferried president @entity131 to @entity132 in 1972 to open @entity135 - @entity134 relations , triggering events that still affect us			0
not enough @entity138 for ya ? this place also houses planes that flew @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
other aircraft include the downright weird @entity146 , a stubby little so - called " parasite fighter " developed to protect bombers after @entity70 @entity149 commenter @entity150 clearly loves the famous airshow in @entity23 , @entity149			1
as a teen , @entity150 watched aviation hall of famer @entity154 perform " the most incredible display of piloting skill and energy management that i have ever seen and probably will never see again			0
" officially , it 's called 2012 @entity23			1
it started as a gathering of 150 people and a handful of airplanes in 1953 and has blown up as one of sport aviation 's top - drawer events , attracting more than a half - million visitors each year , according to its website			2
this year the airshow is set for july 23 - 29 , and as usual , more than 10,000 spectacular aircraft from around the globe are expected to fly in for the @entity149 's world - famous aerial celebration			1
" i personally met [ " miracle on the @entity178 " pilot ] capt. @entity179 [ @entity180 ] , [ legendary test pilot ] @entity179 , and [ @entity182 commander ] @entity183 at @entity184 , " posted commenter @entity185			0
