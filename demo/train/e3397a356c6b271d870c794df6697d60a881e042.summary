@entity0 -- holding a black noose over her head , @entity0 forensics expert @entity2 explained wednesday to a packed courtroom how re-enactments showed that @entity9 engineer @entity8 would have been able to hang himself from a similar black strap attached to his bathroom door			1
" one final push and he lands , " she said , describing how a chair could be shoved away by the feet so a body would drop			0
this was the third day of the inquiry into the death of @entity8 , who was found hanging in his @entity0 apartment on june 24			1
@entity0 's medical examiner concluded that @entity8 committed suicide , but @entity8 's parents disagreed and hired a pathologist in the @entity9 who -- based on @entity0 's autopsy report and photographs of the body -- suggested there was evidence that his death was a homicide			1
@entity0 lawyers hired by the @entity8 family have suggested @entity0 's police work was sloppy and that an assumption of suicide led police to neglect other evidence			1
in court , the @entity41 ' lawyers asserted a possible crime scene was altered : @entity8 's hanging body was cut down and laid on the floor and a nearby chair moved before a forensics team and photographer arrived			2
police maintain this follows standard procedure			0
@entity9 senators seek to stop funding @entity0 firm after @entity9 's death on tuesday a senior police inspector told the court it was n't necessary to take fingerprint or dna swabs at the scene because there were no " tampering marks " on @entity8 's apartment door , and no " signs of ransack " in his apartment			1
the 31 - year - old @entity8 had been working for a year and a half at the @entity0 government 's @entity67 ( @entity69 ) when he decided to quit his job and return home to the @entity9			1
he was part of a team researching uses of @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , a semiconductor that can operate at extremely high temperatures			0

such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses			0
@entity8 's parents believe their son may have been murdered over his knowledge of such a sensitive project			1
they say their son had warned them his life was in danger			0
both @entity69 and @entity82 deny that any joint @entity75 project ever went forward			0
the lawyers for @entity0 's attorney general say they plan to show evidence that @entity8 had little experience in @entity75 work and " found it difficult to cope			1
" the state also says @entity8 's laptop shows he accessed suicide - related web pages in the months before his death , with a search in march on how to tie a hangman 's noose			1
@entity2 , who heads @entity0 's main @entity108 , walked through a detailed presentation of simulations intended to recreate the evidence found in @entity8 's apartment -- the compression marks on the doorframe caused by a hanging weight , and floor scratches that matched the movement of a chair which @entity8 could have pushed away with his feet as he hanged himself			1

but after @entity2 finished , @entity8 's mother appeared unable to continue , and requested the family 's lawyers call for an end to the day 's proceedings			2
outside court , @entity138 and @entity139 expressed disgust with the inquiry			0
" what we 've been discovering is that the evidence that 's been presented , we ca n't rely on			2
it 's been moved , it has n't been preserved and we are trying to get to the bottom of it , if we ever will be able get to the bottom of it , " said @entity146			0
@entity8 's mother , @entity153 , wept as she told reporters the police and @entity0 's investigators had ignored evidence			1
" we have given them evidence from the minute we heard that our son was hung , that he could have been murdered			2
we 've given them computer forensic evidence , we 've given them physical evidence ... why are they not looking into all of those things that add up to murder , not suicide ? " she asked " i am very , very disappointed in this process and i want the truth to be known in @entity0			2
" wednesday 's inquiry also focused on @entity8 's phone and laptop			2
@entity175 , a lawyer for the @entity8 family , had raised the question of whether @entity8 's laptop could have been hacked or remotely accessed to upload information or insert a suicide note			1
@entity0 's technology crime forensics expert @entity181 testified that she had conducted several tests for viruses and that she had found no evidence of remote access or any trace of malicious software			2
" there was only one user by the name of @entity8 to this account , " @entity181 added			2
@entity175 also asked why there was activity on @entity8 's phone after his death , when the phone was in police custody			1
he introduced phone records he said showed activity over a span of five days after @entity8 's death			1
@entity181 told the court it was up to the police to see if there had been any misuse of the phone , to which the @entity8 's lawyer @entity175 replied , " apparently there may be			1
" the inquiry began on monday with the testimony of @entity8 's friends in @entity0			1
@entity8 's girlfriend @entity213 , a nurse in @entity0 , was the first witness to be called			1
she had gone to his apartment on the night of june 24 , concerned when he did n't answer calls or texts , and discovered his hanging body			0
@entity213 testified she did n't know the details of his work but said @entity8 told her " how much he hated " it			2
on one occasion he told her he was " working on something that could get him into trouble with the @entity9 government " and that " heavy hands " were coming after him , though he did n't elaborate			0
but @entity8 had also confided in his girlfriend that he had been depressed since october 2011			0
but she said he " did not display any suicidal tendencies			0
" @entity230 lived across the hall from @entity8			0

@entity230 testified that he and @entity146 talked over beers a month before he died and that he seemed very stressed			0
" he told me he wanted a fresh start			0
he told me he hated his job , " @entity230 said			0
asked by one of the @entity8 's lawyers if he believed @entity8 had taken his life , @entity230 said @entity8 was always " upbeat " and showed " no evidence at all that he would ever take his own life			1
" asked if he was surprised to hear @entity8 had been taking medication for depression , @entity230 said , " it would n't surprise me			0
" looking out at the courtroom he said , " twenty people in this room " could be suffering from depression and no one would know			0
witness testimony will continue until the end of the month			0
the judge in the inquiry - termed the coroner in @entity0 - will issue a final report declaring whether @entity8 committed suicide or whether the facts point to " misadventure			2
