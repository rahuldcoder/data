-- @entity2 @entity1 is the co-author of @entity3 , an annual report examining all aspects of @entity7 's finances with detailed data on teams , drivers , sponsors and races			1
here , he answers key questions about @entity7 's financial model			1
who owns @entity7 ? @entity2 @entity16 : the actual @entity17 -- the companies that own the commercial rights to @entity7 -- is made up of multiple companies			1
we are talking about 30 - 40			2
they invest in multiple jurisdictions -- the @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , all over the place -- but the parent company of the group is called @entity17 and they are based in @entity24			1
so , the owners of that you could say are the ultimate owners			2
it is 35.5 % owned by a private equity firm called @entity35			2
the second biggest shareholder is an @entity38 company called @entity39 -- they have got in the region of 20 %			2
the third biggest shareholder is the estate of @entity43 -- they have somewhere in the region of 12 %			0
@entity46 's family trust has circa 10 % and @entity46 himself has around 5 %			0
it 's a complicated structure			0
how well is @entity7 doing financially ? @entity49 : @entity7 is incredible really			0
i 've never seen a company like @entity7 in terms of revenue generating potential			0
over the past five years we 've had one / two recessions and its revenues and profits have gone up			1
the revenues last year were $ 1.6 billion , 2011 was definitely $ 1.5 billion			1
going back to 2007/08 it was in the region of $ 1.2 billion			1
it 's gone up significantly			0
how is that money generated ? @entity49 : generally speaking , $ 500 million comes from the fees that promoters pay to host races and then another $ 500 million comes from the fees that broadcasters pay to screen the sport			1
then you have circa $ 250 million coming from sponsorship -- trackside advertisers and series sponsors			1
the remaining $ 250 million is coming from things like corporate hospitality			1
what 's the secret of its economic success ? @entity49 : the key driver of the growth is the fees that come from the circuits ( $ 500 million )			1
most of these contracts include clauses that increase the rate by up to 10 % annually			0
it 's a clever strategy because if you look at the secrets to @entity7 's success you can identify several key points			1
the move to @entity94 is one			1
it was n't done out of desire , it was much more out of necessity , although i 'm sure @entity46 would say he wanted to go to these countries			0
the @entity7 calendar is restricted to 20 races a year -- teams refuse to agree to more races -- which makes it difficult to exponentially increase revenues			1
so what @entity46 did was take races to emerging markets			1
it became apparent to countries such as @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 that hosting a @entity7 race is a good way to put their country on the global sporting map			2
@entity7 is the most watched sport in the world -- 500 million viewers a year -- so this is a good way to get your country seen on tv , drive tourism and make yourself look credible alongside other sporting nations			1
do different races pay different fees ? @entity49 : @entity131			1
for example , @entity133 ( @entity134 @entity7 ) you are talking single digits whereas @entity112 you are talking in the region of $ 60 million			2
@entity113 pays $ 66.9 million a year			2
the average fee for hosting is now $ 27 million and that 's driven by these new @entity94 races			1
the bottom line with many of the @entity94 races is that the government will cover the fee because it 's promoting the country whereas in @entity147 , @entity148 ( for example ) does n't need a @entity7 race to promote itself			1
how much of @entity7 profits go to the teams ? @entity49 : essentially , 47.5 % of the profits are split between all of the teams			2
that is what is known as the prize fund			0
in 2011 , profits came to $ 1.1 , 1.2 billion so 47.5 % of that amounts to around $ 400 - 500 million and that is shared between the top ten			1
it 's not shared evenly , it 's based on performance			0
in addition to that certain teams get additional money , with @entity166 being the key beneficiary with , as far as i know , 5 % of profits all to itself			1
then there are two or three funds which are split between the best performing teams -- which generally tend to be @entity166 , @entity171 and @entity172			1
the top teams are given that bonus because they have the heritage and the prestige			1
it 's actually an incredibly clever strategy because the reality of the matter is that the majority of the other @entity7 teams have changed names at least once in the past five years			1
@entity184 was @entity185 , @entity183 was @entity186 , @entity183 was @entity187			0
nobody stopped watching @entity7 because ( of these name changes ) , but if you get rid of @entity166 , @entity171 or possibly now @entity172 that could cause trouble with the viewers			1
why do @entity166 get special treatment ? @entity49 : @entity166 is @entity7 's longest standing team			1
as far as i know it 's the only team that has competed in every year of @entity7 championship			0
but critically @entity166 is the only manufacturer - owned team that directly signs contracts with @entity7 giving the owners more security			1
how are teams further down the grid faring ? @entity49 : there is a real risk of teams leaving @entity7 at the minute because they can not sustain the competition in terms of funding their outfits			2
there are question marks over , basically , all the teams bar @entity166 , @entity171 and @entity172			1
how severe those question marks are is a moot point			0
@entity214 put in its accounts that it was speaking to new investors in 2011 and when the accounts were filed in october 2012 they had n't found any new investors			2
with @entity184 the question mark is nothing more than the fact that they have not scored a point			0
their owners have invested more money than any team in the history of any team in @entity7 to score no points			2
there were rumors this year that @entity183 was looking to sell up before the recent @entity234 investment			0
@entity172 's junior team @entity235 was put on the market ( in 2008 ) and taken off the market because there were no bidders			1
how long is @entity172 going to continue funding that team when it is nowhere near as successful as the other ? how is sponsorship evolving ? @entity49 : what 's increasingly happening is that sponsorship deals are being done with @entity7 owners			1
you have @entity248 and @entity249 in the last three / four months alone doing gigantic deals to sponsor @entity7			0
what you get as a @entity7 sponsor is numerous things			0
you get packages of trackside advertising around the circuit			0
those are probably some of the best value sponsorships in the whole of sport			0
what sponsoring @entity7 offers over sponsoring a team is guaranteed exposure			0
if you 're a team , you could crash out , do badly			0
take a look at @entity171 which is doing far worse this year than it did last			1
it 's harder to build a case to invest in a team than it is to invest in @entity7			0
the fact is that @entity7 can grow , but it 's very difficult for a team to expand			0
the bulk of a team 's revenue comes from sponsorship			0
teams exist to try and win races			1
@entity7 objective is to make profits			0
there is big difference between them			0
where can we expect to see @entity7 races in the future ? @entity49 : @entity284 is on the cards			2
@entity234 is a fact -- they are going ( to @entity288 ) in 2014			0
beyond that , there are so many countries knocking on the door			0
@entity293 , @entity294 , more races in @entity296 -- @entity297 is a strong possibility			2
remarkably , @entity299 wants to host a race , but i do n't think that will ever happen			0
what 's your overall assessment of @entity7 's finances ? @entity49 : the @entity307 is in better health than it ever has been			2
the ( share ) float ( on the @entity112 stock exchange ) is pending			0
@entity35 ( @entity35 ) are saying over the next 12 months pending clarity of @entity46 's situation in @entity148 ( the @entity7 boss was recently indicted by a @entity148 judge investigating allegations of bribery in the wake of the conviction of banker @entity319 )			0
beyond that , it 's a matter of timing			0
there are question marks over the majority of the teams but provided they stay afloat it does n't really matter what guise they race under			2
could another team drop ? yes			0
@entity46 has said himself that 10 teams would be ok .			2

@entity17 has more than *doubled* revenues over past decade
over $ 1.5 billion was generated in 2011 with revenues expected to rise further
fees charged to promoters of @entity94 races and tv rights money has been key to rapid growth
top teams ( @entity166 , @entity171 and @entity172 ) in good financial health but *smaller* teams *struggling*
