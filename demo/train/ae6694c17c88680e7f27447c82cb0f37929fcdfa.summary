-- just a week ago @entity1 was little known aside from the most ardent golf fan , but then came victory in the @entity4 , beating @entity5 and a clutch of big names and now the 23 - year - old @entity8 is firmly in the hunt for an even bigger prize			1
saturday saw @entity1 move to within one shot of leader @entity13 at the @entity14 in @entity15 with a stunning eight - under 64 , including 11 birdies , one short of the @entity18 record			1
@entity1 has carded 52 birdies in his last seven rounds of competitive golf and aims to carry on that form into the final day on the @entity23 at @entity24			2
" i am very confident about tomorrow			0
i will try to do my best			0
and you know , sometimes it goes your way , sometimes not , but i will do the same as today and the first two rounds , " he told gathered reporters			0
" i 'm very happy to play with @entity13 tomorrow ... he 's a great guy and he 's the best player of the year , so i 'm very excited			0
" @entity32 , who can become the first man to win the @entity34 to @entity15 and the @entity35 on the @entity36 in the same season , knows he is in for a fight on the final day			1
" @entity1 is playing incredible golf at the moment			0
i kept hearing that i was the hottest player in the world , but i think he 's just jumped up and grabbed that title the last two weeks , winning last week and then shooting the score that he did today			0
" @entity13 is also being chased for overall honors by @entity47 's @entity46 , who carded a 66 , but is four behind in third place			1
he drew level with his @entity52 neighbor on the back nine of the third round , but @entity13 finished with four birdies in the last five holes to open up a significant advantage as he closed with a 67 for 17 - under overall			2
" i caught him today and i 'll catch him tomorrow , it 's whether or not i can keep hold of him , " @entity46 told the official @entity18 website			0
a win for @entity46 would mean @entity13 would have to finish second to claim the @entity62 trophy , but the 37 - year - old is not thinking that way			1
" i am trying to avoid all that , " he said			0
" i know i can win @entity66 to @entity15 even if i do n't win here , but why not try my hardest to win this tournament ? if i do i know that both trophies are coming home with me , " he added			2
@entity74 champions present and past , @entity71 and @entity72 , can also still deny @entity13 the title with victory in @entity15 , but at 11 under and eight under after both shot rounds of 68 , it is an unlikely permutation			1
so can the man of the moment @entity1 , but he would have to lift the trophy and see @entity32 crumble to finish outside the top 30			1
but he has moved into the top 50 in the world and made a strong start to claim a place in the @entity88 @entity87 team next year at @entity89 .			2

@entity13 *remains* in lead in @entity14 in @entity15
on course to become first man to win race to @entity15 and @entity35 in same season
