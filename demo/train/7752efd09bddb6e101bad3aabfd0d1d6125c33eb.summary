-- every morning @entity1 wakes up unsure whether she will be able to feed her children			0
in her cupboard , nothing but tins of meat and beans			0
she questions whether her sons , who sleep on mattresses on the floor , will get the right nutrition			0

" she is one of more than a hundred thousand @entity19 fighting for food on a daily basis ; using food banks and other charities to ward off hunger and homelessness in the @entity19 -- @entity27 's third - largest economy -- as austerity bites			1
yet from her kitchen window in east @entity30 she can see the big names of a multi-billion dollar financial powerhouse ; @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35			0

" if only i could have their lives for just one day , " she tells @entity0 " and not have to worry about where dinner will come from			0

@entity1 says while she would like to work full time , she has three children to look after so depends on the state subsidies to supplement her low - paying , part - time job in the borough 's school kitchens			2
but as in many @entity27 countries , austerity is top of the agenda for the @entity19 government			1

@entity109 , a spokesman for the @entity110 told @entity0 the government already provides " safety net " essentials like food and housing through the benefits system			2

@entity166 , executive chairman of the @entity49 , told @entity0 that the government 's austerity measures meant people using food banks -- which are intended for emergency support -- needed help more often , placing strain on resources			1
stagnating economic growth and a sovereign debt of 68 % of the @entity19 economic output at the end of 2012 is fuelling the government 's austerity drive			1
