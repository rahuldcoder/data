-- on wednesday , @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 arrives in my former homeland of @entity5			1
this is the first visit by any @entity2 secretary of state since 1955 and a trip i did n't think would happen in my lifetime			2
after all , the @entity2 - backed war in @entity5 left the @entity2 and the new government of @entity5 in tense relations for decades			1
beyond the diplomatic significance of this trip , the visit can help to heal the wounds of war , bringing hope for many @entity2 of @entity5 descent , like myself , that we no longer have to choose between our former and new homelands			1
the visit offers an opportunity to help advance a complex relationship and address one of the remaining war legacies			0
between 1964 and 1973 , during the @entity26 , the @entity2 dropped the equivalent of one planeload of bombs every eight minutes , 24 hours a day , on a country the size of @entity32			2
one ton of bombs was dropped for every person in @entity5 at the time , making the nation the most heavily bombed per capita in history			2
the " @entity41 , " not formally authorized by @entity42 and in violation of international accords , sought to halt communist ground incursions from @entity38 and to cut off activities along the @entity40 in @entity5			1
i grew up not knowing much about this history -- it was n't taught in school -- and what little i knew , i pieced together from my parents , who avoided extensive conversations about the past			0
the bombing ended in 1973 , the same year i was born in the capital city of @entity54			0
the new government came into power shortly after , and by the time i was 6 , my family left @entity5 due to the country 's growing instability			2
the decision to leave their homeland was difficult for my parents , but it was guided by the promise that their young children would one day live the @entity2 dream of bountiful opportunities and lasting freedom			2
our harrowing journey began with the separation of our family members and a secretive swim by my father across the @entity76 to a refugee camp in @entity78 , and eventually led us to northern @entity79 , where i started my new life			0
over the next 20 years , i set about becoming @entity2 , all the while mourning for a homeland i feared i would never see again			0
@entity5 clamped down its borders after 1975 , and relations between the @entity2 and @entity5 , while not severed , were tense			1
when they eventually thawed , i took the opportunity to travel			0
in 2004 , i made my first trip back to @entity5 , and felt a deep affection for the people , culture and land that i barely remembered from my childhood			0
reconnecting with my @entity5 heritage included discovering the dark history and lingering effects of that @entity41 -- of which i and the majority of @entity2 knew little			1
i discovered that the past is still very present			0
in the 40 years since the bombing ceased , 20,000 people have been killed or maimed by unexploded ordnance , with an estimated one - third of @entity5 land still littered with it			1
in subsequent trips , i witnessed the devastating effects of these leftover bombs on the local population : they hinder economic growth and force thousands of people to go about their daily lives in fear of deadly explosions			0
i met children in the countryside , many of whom were just 6 or 7 years old -- the same age i was when my family left the for the @entity2 -- who were maimed by playing or tampering with the small , toylike cluster bombs			1
these children are innocent victims of a war we had thought was long over			0
the @entity2 began funding the cleanup of these bombs in 1997 , and until recently , contributed an average of $ 2.6 million per year to this effort			1
this year , @entity42 directed that this contribution be increased to $ 9 million , a hopeful sign that the @entity2 sees clearance of these bombs as a priority			0
but funding still pales in comparison to the enormity of the problem : only about 1 % of these bombs have been cleared			0
we have a long way to go , but this is a problem that can be solved -- as long as the @entity2 , in cooperation with @entity5 and other international donors , makes a long - term , sustained funding commitment			1
as an @entity2 of @entity5 descent , i am heartened by @entity1 's visit to @entity5			1
the reconciliation process is well under way , and despite the complex history between my two homelands , the @entity2 and @entity5 governments can be on the right side of history and clear @entity5 of these deadly bombs once and for all			1
that way , the dreams that my parents had for me when i resettled in the @entity2 -- to live freely and with bountiful opportunities -- may also be realized for the children in @entity5 for generations to come			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160			0
