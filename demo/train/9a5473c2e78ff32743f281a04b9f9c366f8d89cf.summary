-- it was n't until december 6 that @entity2 could access @entity3 -- the extremely delayed and poorly translated @entity5 version of @entity6			1
the thrown - together @entity5 website has been a thorn in the president 's side with the @entity12 community			1
it 's no surprise that support for @entity15 has waned among @entity2			1
a @entity17 poll found that last year disapproval of @entity15 among @entity12 increased 11 points from september 2013 to december 2013			2
not enough @entity21 are signing up for @entity23 ' misguided health care law			1
and that means more problems -- most notably higher costs -- could be on the horizon			0
so the administration is scrambling in the final three weeks of the enrollment period to sign up enough people to make the health care law work			1
yet the @entity20 is ignoring an inconvenient truth : @entity15 is hurting far too many of our friends and neighbors in the @entity12 community			2
the problems go far beyond the demeaning and sloppy cuidadodesalud.gov			2
one of the biggest fears the @entity20 has is the low enrollment of millennials			0
sixty - five percent of @entity2 in this country are 22 to 35 years old , they are key to the success of @entity15			1
if enough of them do n't sign up for insurance plans , individuals may expect to face higher average costs			0
but millennials say they are n't signing up because coverage is unaffordable -- or does n't make sense for them			0
fusion , a new english - language @entity51 , illustrated the trouble with the health care law when they interviewed a 28 - year - old @entity56 supporter who says he wo n't sign up for coverage because " he 'd rather spend the money on his business , rather than spend it on insurance he says wo n't even help him that much			1
" besides the affordability and enrollment problems for young people , our abuelos -- grandparents -- will be hurt by the new health care law as well			1
due to @entity70 reductions under @entity15 , @entity70 is being cut			2
the @entity72 has called the payment cuts " disturbing " -- and rightfully so			0
thirty - eight percent of @entity2 with incomes of $ 20,000 or less enrolled in @entity70 may face higher fees and fewer benefits			2
but the pain for our community does n't end there			0
across the country , @entity15 is bound to take a toll on some of the 2.3 million @entity12 - owned businesses and 1.9 million workers they help employ			2
the law has made it harder for businesses to hire more workers , and full - time workers have seen their hours reduced to part - time			0
@entity91 , owner of a small business called @entity93 , told @entity94 , " there is no way we can pay or provide employees their health insurance , because there is no margin			0
if i do that , i have to close the doors -- then no one is going to work			0
unfortunately , we are trying to convert our employees from eight hours to 5.5 hours ( daily ) as stated in the new law			0
" hispanics came to this country in search of the promise of individual freedom and opportunity , but @entity15 is undermining that promise			1
we do not need special sign - up programs or false assurances			0
we need real health care reform that actually expands access and lowers costs -- not " reform " that makes life more expensive			1
join us on @entity122 / @entity121			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity125 .			1

dr. @entity125 says @entity56 's @entity5 - language health care site has been sloppy and often down .
she argues the @entity15 will hurt , rather than help , many @entity2
@entity125 : hispanics came to @entity21 for promise of opportunity , but @entity15 is hurting that
