-- @entity1 on saturday slammed the @entity3 's stinging condemnation of its security crackdown , calling the resolution " unjust and blatantly politicized			1
" " it has become clear to the people of @entity1 and the countries that realize the reality of the conspiracy against it that the interest of the @entity1 people is the last thing on the mind of the countries sponsoring such sessions and their impotent resolutions , and that their true goal is inciting the continuation of terrorism against citizens , " according to an official source quoted by the government - run @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
the council , in a 37 - 4 vote , passed a resolution friday that " strongly condemns the continued widespread , systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the @entity1 authorities , such as arbitrary executions , excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters , human rights defenders and journalists , arbitrary detention , enforced disappearances , torture and ill - treatment , including against children			1
" there were six abstentions at the meeting in @entity48 , @entity49			0
the group convened to consider action against @entity1 after a report issued monday by the @entity53 , a body appointed by the council			1
that report concluded security and military forces " committed crimes against humanity " on civilians			2
the resolution recommends that @entity3 bodies " urgently consider " the commission report and " take appropriate action			1
" @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 were among the nations who voted in favor of the resolution			2
those countries are members of the @entity78 , one of the international entities initiating sanctions against the @entity83 regime for its nearly nine - month long bloody push against peaceful protesters			0
the @entity86 , the @entity87 and @entity88 also have imposed sanctions			0
the violence appeared to continue saturday , with the activist group @entity90 reporting 22 dead across the country			1
the highest number of deaths , 10 , occurred in the restive region of @entity96 city and province , in the west			1
at least six were also killed in @entity99 , two each in @entity100 and suburbs of @entity102 , and one apiece in @entity103 and @entity102			0
intense shooting was reported in several locales , including the @entity102 suburb of @entity107 where army forces had allegedly surrounded the @entity109			2
a video statement posted saturday on @entity111 , purportedly from the @entity112 , a military force of defectors , claimed that government snipers fired at protesters in @entity99			2
in response , the group said its members stopped them by destroying two @entity1 armored vehicles and killing " several " security forces			1
@entity24 , meanwhile , reported that 13 " army and security forces martyrs on saturday were escorted from @entity125 to their finale resting place			1
" the deaths were blamed on " armed terrorist groups " -- a term the government commonly uses to describe the opposition , and rationalize its response -- in the " @entity102 countryside			0
" @entity0 is unable to independently confirm events occurring inside @entity1 because the government does not allow journalists free access to the country			2
overall , the @entity138 said this week that more than 4,000 people have died since mid-march and the death toll continues to rise			0
that prompted the the report from the world body 's human rights council , which @entity24 said made judgments " based on information promoted by some groups outside @entity1 and known biased mass media sources			1
" the source cited by @entity24 contended that " several countries at the @entity3 said that the report and the resolution do n't meet the minimum standards of objectivity and professionalism and overstep the jurisdiction of the @entity3 , in addition to ignoring the issue of weapon smuggling and the funding and training of terrorists in special camps outside @entity1			1
" @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 voted against the resolution			0
@entity164 's permanent council representative said the resolution " is designed to further exacerbate the conflict and not to peacefully settle it			0
the resolution is biased , in reflecting the current situation placing full and total blame on the @entity1 government and ignoring those serious crimes by anti-government forces			2
we believe that there is no basis for calling @entity102 's activities crimes against humanity - in any event this goes beyond the mandate of the council			0
" @entity164 has been calling for the violence to stop , no matter where it stems from			0
but it is concerned that several provisions in the resolution could be construed " as an open appeal to interfere in @entity1 's internal affairs , allowing for military actions , including military intervention			1
" the @entity1 source was quoted by @entity24 as saying the council " deliberately ignored documents and information " from @entity1 and failed to mention the government 's reforms			2
even though it was denied access into @entity1 , the @entity53 interviewed " 223 victims and witnesses , including military and security forces who had defected and testified to the role of @entity1 forces in the use of lethal violence against peaceful protests			1
" the @entity86 , @entity209 , and @entity210 , an advocacy group , hailed the council 's move			0
" the time has come for the @entity214 to follow the lead of the @entity78 and @entity88 and impose sanctions			0
it should put in place an arms embargo as well as an asset freeze and travel ban on @entity1 officials responsible for the abuses , and refer the case to the @entity224 , " @entity210 said			0
@entity0 's @entity225 contributed to this report			0
