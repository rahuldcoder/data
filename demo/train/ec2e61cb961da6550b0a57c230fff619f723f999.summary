-- according to @entity3 's watchdog agency , there is a new threat facing the nation 's armed forces , and the @entity7 is not doing enough about it			1
the threat ? global climate change			1
in a recent report , the @entity10 described what that threat looks like today at @entity15 military bases : @entity16 runways at remote radar sites being eaten away by encroaching tides			1
@entity20 training ranges that are flooded , burned by wildfires or bogged down by melting permafrost			1
submarines in dry dock , threatened by coastal flooding that might permanently damage the multibillion - dollar machines			2
investigators heard from military officials that the heavy rain , storm surges , warm temperatures and droughts that caused these conditions are on the rise			0
there is just one problem with the @entity10 's findings : @entity3 , apparently , is not listening			1
the @entity38 just passed an amendment seeking to bar ( @entity40 ) the @entity7 from dealing with global climate change			1
it will be a shame if that language becomes law , because the @entity10 has it right : climate change is a threat to the nation 's security and prosperity			1
on the other hand , that does not mean the @entity52 should muster a @entity53 to go fight the weather			0
to paraphrase the commander in chief , just because the military is a really good hammer does not mean climate change is a nail			1
this is not a threat in the traditional sense of the word , nor is there a military solution			0
climate change is fundamentally an economic challenge for civil society and civilian institutions			1
there is , however , an important defense role in dealing with this challenge			0
military leaders deserve the plaudits they 've received for taking action on climate change			1
the @entity7 's most important contribution lies not in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , however , but in making sure @entity15 armed forces are ready for the consequences of global climate change for defense infrastructure and military missions			1
and in these areas , the @entity7 has a long way to go			2
defense infrastructure is a vast network of land and facilities spread across 27 million acres in every state and around the world			0
that includes training ranges that are crucial for future military readiness , radar sites that monitor threats to the homeland and bases that support ongoing combat operations			1
as the @entity10 report noted , some of these installations are already experiencing climate change effects -- facts on the ground the investigators saw for themselves			1
the consequences could include higher maintenance costs , fewer training days or even a compromised early warning system for attacks on the @entity15			2
the department has started to take practical steps to protect this critical $ 850 billion investment by assessing risks and vulnerabilities in some locations			0
better information will help the military adapt to changing conditions , such as by helping officials prioritize maintenance dollars or revise building codes			0
this does not necessarily mean more spending at the @entity7 , just smarter spending			2
as for military missions , there are a range of effects to consider			0
a recent report by a group of retired high - ranking military officers called climate change a " threat multiplier , " meaning that although climate change itself may not directly harm @entity15 national security , it can worsen or ignite other threats			1
volatile weather patterns may mean less access to food , clean water or shelter , for example , which in turn can undermine weak governments , bring simmering popular resentments to a boil or empower terrorists and extremist groups			0
although it is difficult to say whether such destabilization will result in new @entity15 combat missions , it is important to consider that possibility and more broadly how these dynamics will affect @entity15 interests			2
@entity15 forces will also have to adjust to changes in the physical environment , most obviously the opening of new navigable waterways in the @entity162			0
indeed , the @entity7 released a new strategy for the @entity162 just last year			0
the most direct consequence for @entity15 armed forces will be more military relief missions , such as @entity167 , last year 's aid to an important @entity15 ally , the @entity170			2
humanitarian and disaster relief missions will not be limited to overseas locations , either			0
fourteen thousand defense personnel responded to @entity175 , and last year alone , hundreds of @entity177 members supported civilian authorities in dealing with everything from floods in @entity181 to fires in @entity183 to tornadoes in @entity185			0
the @entity7 deserves credit for the steps it has taken , such as including climate change in its signature strategy , the @entity190			1
but the department also needs to do more to incorporate climate change in how it prepares for the future			1
to be sure , there are many uncertainties involved , but the @entity7 is used to matching billions of dollars against uncertainties , risks and long timelines , using analytical tools such as scenarios , war gaming and mathematical modeling			0
indeed , there may even be new opportunities , such as positive engagement with key partners and allies that need to develop better means for response and resilience to natural disasters			0
unfortunately , many military men and women are reluctant to jump into what appears to be a widening partisan gap on this issue			0
but just as defense professionals would not let differences of political opinion on @entity221 or the rebalance to the @entity223 stop them from taking prudent steps to plan for the defense implications of both , they should not shy away from climate change			2
secretary of defense @entity229 said last year that " the effects of climate change ... are far - reaching and unpredictable , demanding our attention and strategic thinking			2
" as the @entity7 acts on @entity238 's words , it will be a matter of pragmatism , not politics			0
hopefully , members of @entity3 will follow the recommendations of their own watchdog and stop trying to stand in the way of the progress the @entity7 needs to make			1
join us on @entity248 / @entity247 .			0

@entity250 : @entity3 ' watchdog finds climate change threatens @entity15 military bases
she says @entity7 is smart to address the issue to *prevent* further damage
@entity38 passed *legislation* that would *obstruct* effort to fight climate change
@entity16 runways , @entity20 training ranges , submarines are all threatened , @entity10 found
