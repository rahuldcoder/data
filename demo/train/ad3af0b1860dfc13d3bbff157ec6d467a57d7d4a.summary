@entity0 -- president @entity2 broke his silence on the @entity5 movie massacre wednesday night and spoke out on the issue of gun control			1
" i believe the majority of gun owners would agree ... that we should check someone 's criminal record before they can check out a gun seller ; that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily , " said the president			2
" these steps should n't be controversial			1
they should be common sense , " he added			0
should n't be controversial ? common sense ? the president knows full well that @entity25 strategists -- including those who run his re-election effort -- see gun control as political dynamite			1
they have since @entity32 lost the presidency by failing to win conservative states , an outcome many democrats blame in part on @entity32 's push for gun control			1
for @entity30 , gun politics are bad politics still , @entity2 is the party 's leader			2
so we wanted to know whether his @entity25 colleagues in @entity43 agree			0
" i do n't know how anyone could disagree with what the president said yesterday , " said senate majority leader @entity44			2
@entity44 agrees and he controls the @entity49 agenda			2
so he can do something about it			0
@entity1 's @entity52 asked the next logical question			0
will @entity30 act ? " with the schedule we have , we 're not going to get into the debate on gun control , " @entity44 responded			1
" but i 'm very happy , i 'm glad the president made the statement because it 's something that needs to be done			0
but we 're not going to address gun control			1
so action wo n't happen this year			2
what about next year ? @entity52 followed up : " if you hold onto the majority next year , would @entity30 commit to making it part of your agenda ? " he asked			0
@entity44 smirked in a way that made clear he could see the political minefield ahead , and he was n't going anywhere near it			2
@entity76 sends @entity30 a message over ag contempt vote " @entity79 try			0
@entity79 try , ok ? " he glared			0
in the @entity82 , minority leader @entity81 was prepped and ready for questions about the president 's comments on gun control , telling reporters she viewed his remarks " a number of times			1
" " i thought his comments were very thoughtful -- provided leadership when he said we need to build a national consensus to reduce violence in our country , " she said			0
unlike @entity44 , @entity81 does not control the @entity82 agenda , but she 's never shy about using her microphone to make clear what @entity30 want			1
she 's also a seasoned politician who wants the @entity82 majority and her speaker 's gavel back			0
that means retaking conservative districts where guns are popular			0
" there are important voices on all sides of this issue			1
we really need , we all recognize the importance of the @entity115 and the need to , and also the need to reduce violence in our communities , " @entity81 said			1
we then took the president 's remarks to the halls of @entity43 and asked rank and file @entity30 what they thought			0
hill democrats look to ' silent majority ' on gun control @entity25 rep. @entity129 is from @entity130 , where being anti-gun is n't very dangerous politically			1
" it 's harder to get cold medicine in @entity5 or anywhere else than it is to get 6,000 bullets apparently over the @entity136 and i think that 's , you know , a common sense conversation that needs to take place , " @entity129 said			0
but @entity142 's @entity141 is a @entity143 from the kind of pro-gun congressional district his party is panicked about losing by pushing too hard on gun control			1
still , he said he thought the presidents remarks were an " an important ice - breaker			0
" " it 's been a muted conversation for too long			0
you know , not just the tragedy that happened in @entity5			0
it 's a continuing cycle , and we do n't talk about it , and i think there is rational discussion that needs to occur , " @entity141 said			2
being from an @entity142 border district full of voters who cherish their gun rights , @entity141 said he was sure he would be hearing about these remarks from some upset folks back home			1
" i think it 's a tough thing , because the ( @entity76 ) carries with it a threat , a threat that if you speak against any point of gun control , you automatically face a political threat , " @entity141 said			1
he is well - versed on the history of his party 's retreat from the politics of gun control			1
" since 1994 , after the @entity176 , that we lost the @entity82 in those years because of that , and there 's been a reluctance to address it , and like i said , the perceived threat of the @entity76 , " @entity141 said			2
" i think the majority of the @entity184 people want us to have a rational discussion that protects their fundamental rights and the @entity115 , but also protects the public safety			1
i do n't that 's a contradiction , " he said			2
@entity1 's @entity52 and @entity190 contributed to this report			0

gun control steps should n't be controversial , @entity2 says
@entity44 : " with the schedule we have , we 're not going to get into the debate on gun control . "
@entity81 : " there are important voices on all sides of this issue "
rep. @entity141 : protecting @entity115 rights and public safety not a contradiction
