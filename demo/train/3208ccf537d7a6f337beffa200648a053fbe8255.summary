-- it 's not a phrase that usually gets said out loud , but you have to feel sorry for @entity4			1
the @entity6 player has just finished the season of his life , winning @entity10 's @entity9 while vanquishing the club 's hated @entity12 foes @entity14			1
he scored more goals than he ever has before too , 46 in the league to be precise , and 60 overall			1
yet even though @entity6 finished nine points clear of second place , it is @entity14 's @entity20 that still gets all the attention			1
" some people say i 'm better , other people say it 's him , but at the end of the day , they 're going to decide who is the best player , " @entity4 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview before this weekend 's @entity24 final between @entity25 and @entity26 at @entity28 's @entity27			1
" at the moment ... i think it is me , " he laughs			0
" sometimes ( the comparisons with @entity20 ) makes me tired ... for him too because they compare us together all the time			1
@entity20 breaks @entity14 's all - time scoring record " you can not compare a @entity41 with a @entity42 because it 's a different engine			1
you can not compare them			0
he does the best things for @entity14 , i do the best things for @entity6			1
" i think we push each other sometimes in the competition , this is why the competition is so high			0
this is why @entity6 and @entity14 are the best teams in the world because everyone pushes each other , not just me and @entity20 but other players			1
" good cop / bad cop perhaps @entity4 is right			1
the world needs the " good cop / bad cop " routine of @entity20 and @entity4 to bring the best out of both them			1
it might be the reason why neither has set the world alight on the international stage			2
but while @entity20 is hailed as a secular saint , @entity4 is derided for his self - confidence , some would say over-confidence			1
how does he cope with the vitriol he provokes in opposition fans ? " sometimes , you have to put on a mask			0
you can not smile every time for all the people			0
it 's impossible , i can not do that , " he says			2
" this is not my type of personality			0
and people really do n't know me			0
and i do it for that because i do n't want every person to know me , just close friends ... you know , my friends , teammates			0
these people know me very well			0
other people , to be honest , i really do n't care about that			0
" still , such has been @entity6 's dominance in the league that @entity4 is entitled to feel , if not exactly sycophantic praise , then at least recognition of his and his team 's achievements			1
" my high point ( in my career ) is to win the title here in @entity6 , @entity9 , " he explains			1
@entity107 win gives @entity6 the edge over rivals " ( it ) was my first time , so i was so happy because it 's my best moment here in @entity6 , the most important trophy			1
in terms of individual , it was great for me , the goals that i scored , to break my own record ... to do 100 points in the @entity10 league which is a record too			1
" for me this is the most difficult league in the world			2
to compete with @entity14 , as everyone knows is very complicated and we beat them			0
nine points ahead ... so it was an amazing year			0
" in @entity14 's shadow ? @entity14			2
it is the shadow that follows not just @entity4 , but also @entity6 coach @entity132 , who has also had a remarkable season in @entity10			1
you could argue it is a shadow that follows the city of @entity6 around too			1
" the points speak for themselves , " @entity4 replies when asked about the rivalry			1
" nine points separated @entity6 and @entity14 ; it 's a lot here in @entity10			1
we played better than them this year , i 'm sure about that			0
i remember we went there one month ago and we won 2 - 1 ... nobody can do that , it 's very difficult so we deserve to win the league			1
we are better than them at the moment , but we have to respect them because they are a great team too			0
" now there has never been a better time for @entity6 to break the spell of @entity14			1
with coach @entity157 gone and questions being raised about the age of the @entity14 squad , @entity4 believes that @entity6 could go on to do something special , with the " @entity162 " at the helm			1
drained @entity157 quits @entity14 " as a person ( @entity132 's ) a humble guy ... he 's very simple			1
we joke all the time , with funny stories all the time			0
in terms of coaching , he 's completely different			2
he 's so serious , so professional			2
" for @entity4 , @entity132 has proven himself to be the best coach in the world			1
" this is why he wins the titles that he won			2
because for me , not just because i work with him , but he 's the best because of what he does : the tactics , everything around the players , the motivation ... and you know , the titles speak for themselves			2
he won in every country that he 's passed , so i think that 's great			2
i think nobody ... two or three coaches do that in their lives , so we have to appreciate that			0
" the worst day yet the season has not been without its disappointments			0
it may well have delivered the greatest single triumph in @entity4 's career so far , but it also delivered its nadir -- losing to @entity25 on penalties in the @entity24 semifinals			1
@entity4 missed a spot - kick during the shootout as @entity6 's wait for a record - extending 10th @entity204 title spilled into its second decade			1
" to be honest , it was one of the worst days in my career so far , " he admits			0
@entity4 , @entity6 suffer heartache " it 's always tough when you lose something , when you lose on penalties			1
but i 'm not really worried about that because if i did n't score the two goals most of the players are n't going to shoot the penalties , so i have to appreciate what i did in the @entity24 , what i did for the club			2
" the dream @entity6 - @entity14 final did n't happen			2
instead we have a final that no one could predict			0
on the one hand a @entity25 side that unexpectedly fought back to knock out @entity6			2
on the other hand a @entity26 side that shocked @entity14 , the world , and one suspects , even themselves			0
who does @entity4 think will win ? " most people think that @entity25 is going to win easily			2
i do n't think so , " he says , perhaps remembering the battles he had with @entity26 while playing for @entity235 in the @entity236			0
" do n't forget that @entity26 beat @entity14 , which is very , very tough			0
it will be an interesting game			0
i do n't know which team is going to win			0
i 'm not going to bet on anything because @entity26 is very strong			0
they defend well , they have a good counterattack			0
@entity25 is a fantastic team too , so it will be a good game			0
" in 12 months ' time he will hope to realign the order of things and play in the 2013 @entity24 final			0
for now he 'll have to make do with being the best player in the best league with the best manager in the world			0
should you feel sorry for @entity4 ? so far everything seems to be going just fine			2
