-- on thursday night , i returned to @entity2 , @entity3 , to participate in the funeral and mourning of @entity6 , president of @entity3 from 1999 until his passing this week			1
@entity6 's death has captured the world 's attention front and center with renewed vigor and interest			1
he first burst onto the world scene with his presidential victory in 1999			0
since then , through his fourth re-election in january -- and while he was in @entity16 fighting the cancer that would take his life -- his focus was on forging a new socialist @entity3			2
this won many friends and advocates at home and abroad , especially among @entity3 's and the hemisphere 's poorest populations			2
other world powers demonized @entity6 and sought to ostracize him , a la @entity16 's @entity27 , on a global scale			1
but i believe peaceful , constructive negotiation should carry the day over isolation and demonization			0
that 's why i visited @entity3 in 2005 , just after the rev. @entity34 called for the assassination of @entity6			1
he inflamed a chorus of extremist voices in seeking a way to " deal with @entity6			2
" that type of hot rhetoric serves no productive purpose			1
i went to talk with @entity6 ; i talked with @entity43 religious leaders in @entity3			1
i learned about the transition taking place from the old banana republic regimes to the new leaders , with new ideas , such as @entity6 in @entity3 , @entity50 in @entity51 and @entity52 in @entity53			1
i looked not to exploit differences and fuel division , but for common ground			0
that 's why i went to @entity58 to talk with @entity59 in 1990 as he invaded @entity60 and convinced him there was no value in holding hundreds of people from the @entity65 and other countries as " human shields			1
that 's why i went to what remained of @entity72 amid the flames of war in 1999 , to talk with @entity75 to persuade him to release the three @entity65 soldiers being held hostage			2
and that 's why i went to @entity16 in 1984 -- long under a senseless @entity65 blockade -- to talk with @entity27 and persuade him to release dozens of political prisoners			1
in each instance , the @entity65 had a no - talk policy with these leaders and nations			1
it 's been my experience that talking , keeping lines of communication open to friend and foe alike , can reap dividends			2
@entity92 can not always agree , but we can always talk			0
that does not require a sacrifice of principles or signal weakness			0
i believe in the @entity99 principles , favoring peaceful negotiation over military confrontation			0
he called the doctrine " satyagraha " -- and explained the " pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one 's opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and compassion			0
" for what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other			0
and patience means self - suffering			0
so the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth , not by infliction of suffering on the opponent , but on oneself			0
in my view , it 's always more productive and mutually beneficial to talk things out and not fight things out			0
as the world mourns the death of @entity6 , it 's time to go beyond divisive rhetoric and historical fears that leave all of us in the dark			1
where is our common ground ? we are neighbors ; we live in the same hemisphere			0
there are 200,000 @entity3 living in the @entity65 -- including nearly 70 @entity141 baseball players in 2012 , among them @entity143 winner @entity142			2
@entity3 surpassed @entity145 as the nation with the largest oil reserves in the world , and the @entity65 is the largest importer of @entity3 oil			1
that oil is four days away , compared with four weeks away in the @entity151			0
there is a huge potential to expand our market and @entity3 's			2
and with stronger economic ties comes political stabilization			0
it 's time to turn crisis into opportunity , to fulfill the unfinished business of realizing to the fullest potential the relationship between the @entity65 and @entity3			1
seize this moment to heal the wound and bind the ties			0
it wo n't be easy , but nothing is			0
and nothing will be accomplished with a no - talk policy			0
no doubt , @entity3 's relations with the @entity65 have been strained -- diplomatic relations were severed for a time in 2008 when @entity3 accused the @entity65 of plotting the overthrow of @entity6			1
just last week , days before @entity6 died , vice president @entity173 expelled two @entity65 military officials , accusing the @entity65 of trying to destabilize the government			2
the good news is that president @entity177 has sought to restore relations , saying in a statement that the @entity65 " reaffirms its support for the @entity3 people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with @entity3 's government			1
... as @entity3 begins a new chapter in its history , the @entity65 remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles , the rule of law and respect for human rights			2
" the @entity65 is sending an official delegation to @entity6 's funeral			1
and @entity177 and secretary of state @entity194 have expressed their desire to forge a more positive and productive relationship with @entity3			0
as i meet with political , religious and community leaders in @entity3 , this is the message i bring			1
let 's put an end to hot rhetoric , demonization and policies of isolation			0
it 's time to forge a practical , productive relationship that will lead to normalization of diplomatic relations between the @entity65 and @entity3 .			1

@entity213 : @entity6 's death an opportunity for @entity65 and @entity3 to heal relations
he says we have demonized @entity6 , but this rhetoric serves no good purpose
@entity213 : @entity65 - @entity3 bond will be beneficial to both countries , in trade and oil
@entity213 will be talking with religious , political leaders to *rebuild* diplomatic ties
