-- online video has gotten a bum rap			1
@entity3 is often thought of as a home for juvenile idiocy , mindless narcissism and not much more			1
the collective 80 million hours we spend watching it every day seems to some like a terrible waste of human attention			0
but if you dig under the surface , you can discover something much more hopeful			0
hidden among all the cute kittens and pirated tv shows , online video is driving astonishing innovation in thousands of different fields ranging from the ultra-niche to the sharing of truly world - changing ideas			1
in my @entity25 talk , just posted , i point to numerous examples of this innovation , such as the dance revolution exemplified by a dance troupe called the @entity30 who played the @entity32 this year			1
and i coin a term for it : crowd - accelerated innovation			1
the term is new , but the process is old			0
actually , this is pretty much the only type of innovation there has ever been			1
contrary to the romantic myth , innovation does n't suddenly emerge from lone geniuses and their eureka moments			1
it emerges when groups of people spark off each other			0
in history , progress took off when people came together in cities , and the scientific revolution took off when people around the world could read about each others ' discoveries in print			0
we 're a social species			0
we spark off each other			0
one of the most significant aspects of the @entity64 is that it has connected vastly larger groups than ever before in history , and thereby sparked massive new types of innovation			1
for example , the open - source movement that created @entity71 and scores of other incredible pieces of software would not have been possible before the @entity64 brought programmers together			1
similar explosions in innovation have happened in music , photography and animation , to name just three areas			2
but what these fields have in common is that people 's work output could be easily shared digitally -- via still photographs , mp3 files , and software programs , for example			1
the reason online video is so significant is that it is now allowing the rest of the world 's talents to be shared digitally			1
it 's not just @entity3 , of course , it 's all over the @entity64			1
here are some examples : unicycling makeup artistry @entity102 dance skateboarding sports training science the world of ideas in my talk , i explain that you need just three things in place for crowd - accelerated innovation to take off : a " crowd , " " @entity117 " and " @entity118			1
" crowd : it can be any group , small or large , of people who share a common interest			2
the bigger the group , the better the chance that it contains real innovators			0
but successful crowds also depend on lots of other roles like trend - spotters , cheerleaders , commenters , and even skeptics			2
light : you need to be able to see what the very best people in the crowd are capable of			2
and the amazing thing about the @entity64 is that even when the crowd is in the millions , the best contributors can readily bubble up to the surface -- for example , by winning the most views or highest ratings on a website			1
desire : on the @entity64 , this is provided through social recognition			0
if you can do something innovative and special , you get thousands of people viewing your work and talking about you			0
and it 's driving hundreds and hundreds of hours of effort from potential innovators across the globe			2
the rise of online video has vastly expanded the @entity116 , shone a brighter light on the best talent , and dialed up the @entity118 by offering participants a form of global fame			1
someone sees a video with 50,000 views and thinks , " that 's awesome , i 'll copy it and take it to the next level			1
" they emulate , then they innovate , and the bar gets raised again and again			0
we 've noticed it on our website http://www.ted.com /			0
ever since we started posting @entity25 talks online , speakers have started raising their game			2
they could see what great @entity25 talks looked like			0
and they had a greater motivation to shine			0
so the amount of preparation going into each talk rose dramatically			0
but the phenomenon is everywhere , and it has the potential to transform any organization and give an amazing platform to any individual			0
i 'm convinced that the latest iteration of crowd - accelerated innovation , fueled by web video , is about to ignite the biggest learning cycle in human history			1
there are huge implications for the future of global education			2
tomorrow 's best teachers will be global stars reaching literally millions of kids			1
and talented students around the world will no longer have their potential destroyed by lousy teachers			2
they can learn directly from the world 's finest			2
my talk ends with an incredible video shot in @entity214 's biggest slum , which turns out to be teeming with innovation , innovation that in past years would have simply remained invisible to the rest of the world			1
if we 're in an age where the @entity25 audience can learn from residents of a slum and vice versa , there 's reason to be hopeful for our future			2
reaction to the talk has been intense			0
it 's sparked dozens of comments and loads of new ideas			0
but what do you think ? have you had an instance where web video has taught you something important or provoked you to action ? have you made videos yourself , and has the process of making them motivated you to innovate ? if so , i 'd love to hear from you			0
i will be reading every comment submitted below			0
