-- for a country of just 2.1 million people in an area more than twice the size of @entity3 , @entity1 has seen more than its share of conflict over the past 120 years			1
dragged into the 20th century as a @entity3 imperial protectorate , @entity10 , as it was known then , was the scene of violent insurrections by indigenous people and brutal crackdowns by colonial administrators			1
in 2004 , @entity3 offered its first formal apology for the massacre of an estimated 65,000 members of the @entity20 tribe who sustained a rebellion between 1904 and 1907 before they were forced into the desert where many perished			1
descendants of the few survivors are still seeking $ 4 billion compensation from the @entity3 government for what they claim was an orchestrated campaign of extermination that pre-figured @entity3 's genocidal policies of the @entity34			2
@entity1 's troubled history continued deep into the 20th century : in 1920 the @entity36 mandated the country to @entity38 , which imposed its apartheid laws on the region after 1948			1
in 1966 , the @entity42 @entity41 ( @entity41 ) launched a war of independence for the area that became @entity1			1
the simmering guerilla campaign continued for 22 years , when @entity38 agreed to end administration of the region under a @entity49 peace plan			1
@entity41 has governed since @entity1 won independence in 1990 in a functioning democracy that saw @entity52 take his second five - year term as president following elections in 2009			1
test your knowledge of @entity1 even with independence , @entity1 's problems continued			2
in the 1990s , a secessionist movement in the @entity61 , in eastern @entity1 , caused thousands to flee to @entity62			2
the government has since calmed the restive region , declaring it safe for tourism			0
today @entity1 struggles with huge unemployment ( around 50 % of the population , according to the @entity69 )			2
@entity70 affects 15 % of the population , according to data compiled by the @entity72 and more than half the population lives below the international poverty line of $ 1.25 a day , according to data from the @entity49			0
with one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world , the result , in large part , of a rural , cashless subsistence economy , land reform is one of @entity1 's most hotly contested issues			1
there are believed to be 4,000 commercial farms - mostly white - owned - that occupy up to half of @entity1 's arable land			1
the government 's aim is to resettle landless @entity1 on this land on a " willing buyer , willing seller " arrangement			2
however , expropriations have taken place because too few farmers have been willing to sell			0
in a bid to speed up the land reform process , the government has moved to loosen up restrictive terms that heavily favored the government in negotiations with farmers over land sales			0
just 1,000 of these commercial farms have been purchased by the government as part of its land reform program , and white farmers must offer the government first refusal on any sale of land			0
continuing wrangling has acted as a serious disincentive to further investment in the country 's valuable arable land			0
currently , mining -- particularly diamonds , copper , gold , zinc , lead , uranium -- constitutes more than 12 % of @entity1 's gdp , according to government figures			2
its other largest sectors are tourism , agriculture at more than 9 % and manufacturing at more than 15 %			0
the latter , however , struggles as it competes with a highly subsidized manufacturing sector in neighboring @entity38			0
ultimately , however , @entity1 's most precious resource is likely to be water			0
sandwiched between two of the world 's most famous deserts - the @entity139 and the @entity140 - @entity1 is the driest country in @entity142 , with less than 370mm of rainfall on average each year			1
send in your photos of @entity1 however , this year the @entity1 department of water affairs announced the discovery of a significant body of underground water - an aquifer dubbed @entity154 - that scientists say could supply the north of the country with enough water for centuries			1
situated on the border with @entity163 , @entity1 's side of the 10,000 - year - old aquifer covers an area about 70km by 40km ( 43 miles by 25 miles )			1
project manager @entity167 , from the @entity165 ( @entity166 ) , told the @entity168 that it was a substantial body of water and could supply 40 % of the nation 's population for as long as 400 years			0
" old water can be , unlike old beer , very fresh and clean , as it was infiltrated before environmental pollution was an issue , " @entity167 told the newspaper			0
@entity0 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity1 is over twice the size of @entity3 and the driest country in @entity142
colonized by @entity3 and later ruled by apartheid - era @entity38
@entity193 came in 1990 after 22 years of war
@entity197 *beauty* of *landscape* and deserts matched by *challenges* to *improve* economy and lives of @entity1
