@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was n't until @entity4 broke his glasses in taekwondo practice that he realized just how much he relied on them			1
his prescription was so high that he had to wait a week to get a new pair			2
for @entity4 , then a high school freshman , those seven days were a blur			1
" i just could n't see anything , " said @entity4 , now 17			1
" i could n't see in the classroom ; i would get easily distracted			2
... just basic stuff i used to do every day , i could n't do			2
" @entity4 's eyes were also opened to a much larger problem			1
he saw on the internet that more than 12 million children worldwide do n't have the corrective eyewear they need ( @entity20 )			1
" it 's just a total disadvantage for them , because ( if ) you ca n't see anything ... you definitely ca n't make the most of the education you 're being given , " he said			2
" it would be impossible for them to fully achieve their potential			0
" i had this problem for one week , but these kids have these problems for their whole lives			0
" so at just 14 , @entity4 started @entity35 , an organization that collects used eyeglasses from optometrists and donates them to organizations that can deliver them to children in need			1
since 2011 , @entity4 has donated 9,500 pairs of glasses , worth nearly $ 500,000 , to young people in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
for @entity4 , who has worn glasses since he was 5 years old , the idea of repurposing old eyewear made sense			1
most of his family members wear glasses , and just searching his own home yielded instant results			2
" i found 10 to 15 pairs just lying around the house in random drawers , " @entity4 said			1
he realized those glasses alone could help 10 or 15 children			1
so , with help from his father , @entity4 set up his organization and approached local optometrists , who agreed to put out drop boxes where patients could donate their used eyeglasses after getting a new pair			1
" that first interaction was really promising for me , " he said			0
" some of ( the optometrists ) already had pairs of glasses that they had just accumulated over the years that they did n't know what to do with			1
" in the past three years , @entity4 has gone on numerous trips to @entity47 and @entity48 , where he not only provides glasses but also assists the doctors and volunteers at eye clinics			1
those who work with him see his age as an asset			0
" he works hard and has great initiative , but more importantly , he brings such great energy -- and that sets the tone for everyone , " said dr. @entity81 , president of the @entity1 chapter of @entity83			0
@entity4 says that being in the field is the best part of his work			1
" that dazed look the first time ( children ) get glasses , and just seeing that turn into joy and happiness ... it 's just really inspiring , " he said			2
@entity4 knows that the glasses he 's providing can make a big impact			1
" a lot of times , these families are in poverty , " he said			0
" with a good education , you know , they can get a good job and get a good career			0
" helping others motivates @entity4 , whose family immigrated to the @entity110 from @entity47 when he was just 1 year old			2
" we had a really tough time adapting , " @entity4 recalled			2
" i ( am ) sympathetic to people who ( are ) struggling			0
" @entity4 , a senior in high school , helps fund his work by tutoring younger students after school , and he spends about 20 hours a week collecting and shipping the glasses			1
he plans to continue when he gets to college , and he has his eye on expanding into new territory			0
" right now , we 're partnered with organizations that do international work			0
but in the future , i 'd like to bring this service to inner cities in the @entity110 , " he said			0
@entity4 has gotten a lot of attention for his work , including being honored at a @entity132 event in july			2
but he says other people his age are also finding ways to give back			0
" i think there 's a misconception with our generation , " he said			0
" many of my friends are doing things to improve their communities			0
" kids are passionate and can make a difference			0
it 's just a matter of finding out what you care about and focusing on that			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity35 website to see how to help .			0
