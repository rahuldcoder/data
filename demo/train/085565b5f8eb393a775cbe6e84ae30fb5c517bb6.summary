@entity0 , @entity1 -- a trip to the grocery store used to send @entity5 into a panic			2
when the @entity8 veteran heard a child crying , he remembered kids screaming in @entity11			2
coins jingling in the register reminded him of ammunition carried around a soldier 's neck			2
he would be in a store aisle , but not remember how he got there			2
the movements and sounds put his mind back in @entity22 , back in a war zone			1
calling it " a mesh of realities " @entity5 said " it 's enough to make your mind fracture			2
" @entity5 , 27 , has post-traumatic stress disorder , a severe anxiety disorder commonly characterized by flashbacks , nightmares and a heightened state of alertness			1
of the more than 2 million @entity38 troops deployed to @entity22 and @entity39 since october 2001 , it 's estimated that one in five is likely to be afflicted by ptsd or major depression , according to the @entity43 these are often referred to as invisible wounds , and for veterans like @entity5 , the suffering runs deep			1
by the time he returned home from his second combat tour six years ago , @entity5 was having nightmares every day			2
he had a hard time communicating with his wife			2
paranoid of everything , he isolated himself			2
" i 'd stay in my house all the time , " said @entity5 , who was in the @entity53 from 2003 - 2007			2
" @entity55 were blacked out			2
i had cameras on the outside so i could monitor the surrounding area			2
... the outside scared the hell out of me			2
" fortunately , things started to change for the better about a year ago when he was matched with his service dog , @entity64 , through @entity65			1
the nonprofit , started by @entity67 , helps veterans train their own service dogs in northern @entity1			1
" it 's hard enough to come out of the service and get back into civilian life , " said @entity67 , who served in the @entity70 from 1975 - 1984			1
" but now they have an injury that people do n't understand			0
they have to find a way to balance what they 're feeling , what they 've experienced , with everyday life			0
" " service dogs are but one tool , but they 're a very important tool , in the healing process for our veterans			1
" dogs can be trained to assist veterans in a variety of ways			1
for example , @entity64 wakes @entity5 from nightmares , turns off lights and helps create space between @entity5 and others in public places			0
the dog also helps @entity5 keep his anxiety level down in stressful situations			1
the veterans " are taught to focus on the dog , read the dog 's body language , not to worry about the environment , " said @entity67 , 55			1
" if they start to have a panic attack because they 're getting overwhelmed or the anxiety is so strong , they 'll actually stop and kneel down and hug the dog			1
" through her program , @entity67 can match veterans with dogs from shelters or rescue groups			1
then she helps them train the dog			0
" when a veteran trains their own service dog , there are immediate benefits right off the bat , " she said			1
" they have a mission and a purpose again			0
it gives them something to focus on and to complete			0
it gives them a sense of security and safety			0
... they know they 're not alone			0
they 've always got their buddy at the end of the leash			0
" there are many groups across the country that provide veterans with service dogs , but the methods in which they work vary			1
typically , organizations breed , raise and train dogs before pairing them with veterans , a process that can take months or years			1
some , like @entity67 's group , use a train - the - trainer approach			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity159 @entity67 started training dogs more than 30 years ago while she was in the @entity70 , and she translated that to civilian life , where she runs a canine obedience school			1
it was only recently that she started focusing on war veterans			1
in 2009 , she received a call from a @entity53 who had been waiting more than a year for a service dog			1
he was looking for a trainer who would help him train his @entity169 puppy instead			0
@entity67 did extensive research about ptsd and service dogs , and in january 2010 she started working with the young veteran to train the dog for his individual needs			1
within a month , two other veterans contacted @entity67 , and she matched them with dogs from shelters			1
" the more veterans that started asking for help , the more i realized this is what i was supposed to do , " she said			1
since then , @entity67 and her group have worked with more than 70 veterans from all over the @entity38			1
" i connect with these veterans because i am a veteran , " she said			1
" i understand the military culture			0
i understand , to a certain extent , what they 've gone through even though i have n't walked in their shoes			0
" @entity67 has personally worked with every veteran and dog that has gone through her training program , which lasts at least eight months and can take as long as a year			1
" the dog is with them 24 hours a day , seven days a week			0
it 's a constant , " she said			0
" every day , everything is a training opportunity			1
they get to work and move forward			0
so as they progress , they see the success			0
" for @entity5 , training @entity64 has given him the opportunity to build a strong bond			1
" just like your combat buddies watch your back , this dog has got to have that same kind of trust , " he said			0
" and that trust is n't something that 's built up in a short amount of time			0
" to participate in @entity222 's program , veterans must be under some form of professional treatment for their disabilities and they must provide a prescription or doctor 's letter stating they 'll benefit from a service dog			1
before they start training , @entity67 spends several hours getting to know the veteran , which helps her find them the right dog with the right temperament			1
" i try to get a sense of ... who they are , what they 're struggling with ... what they liked to do before they got injured , " she said			0
@entity65 , which runs on donations and community support , provides veterans with vests , leashes , collars , bowls , food and initial medical care and vaccines for the dog			1
the training is also free			1
after a veteran has completed the program , @entity67 follows up with them weekly for the first 90 days , and then at least once a month for a year			0
but she said a lot of the veterans stay in touch even after that			2
" you start to see them getting their confidence back , communicate differently , " she said			0
and they 're beginning to participate in life again			0
in some cases , they 're actually able to go back to work			0
they 're able to communicate with their families ... have a conversation with a stranger			0
" @entity5 said that because of @entity64 , his nightmares have decreased and he 's able to take his family out to restaurants and movies			0
" without @entity64 , i would still be in my house ... probably divorced from my wife and very estranged from my son , " @entity5 said			0
" and everything would continue to just fall on me until eventually i either decided it was time to end it and die , or just give up			0
" recently , @entity67 started a mentoring program to teach some of the veterans how to train new participants			2
ultimately , she hopes to employ these veterans in several new locations throughout the country			2
" my life is blessed every day that i get to spend time with these amazing men and women who 've served our country , " she said			0
" being able to help them find that joy back in their life ... it 's priceless			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity305 website at @entity306 and see how to help .			0
