@entity0 , @entity1 -- more than 270,000 gamers from throughout @entity4 and beyond have converged in the beautiful city of @entity0 for the annual @entity8 video game festival			1
the show , which is more than twice as large as @entity10 , offers attendees the first hands - on opportunities with some of the biggest games coming this fall and later			1
@entity15 is using one of the 10 massive halls at the @entity18 to allow gamers to play through four multiplayer maps from @entity22 's " @entity21 : @entity24 " fans wait in line for hours for the chance to experience the games they likely already ordered for this @entity28			1
@entity8 is growing at a rapid pace			1
more than 600 exhibitors from 40 countries are displaying their games -- 20 % more exhibitors than two years ago and 40 % more countries connecting with the @entity4 gaming audience			1
while there are literally hundreds of games playable at the festival , the following five games made their world premieres this week and are worth checking out when they hit a console near you over the coming year			1
army of two : @entity45 ( @entity47 / @entity46 , @entity48 , @entity49 , march 2013 ) @entity47 knows that two shooters are better than one			0
" army of two : @entity45 " is the third game in the bestselling franchise that sends a pair of heavily armed private military operators south of the border on a deadly mission			0
with plenty of drug cartel henchmen to go around , this co-op game has been designed from the ground up for two players to collaborate as they navigate a serpentine plot of danger and corruption			0
this game introduces plenty of weapons to equip and extensive customization options for soldiers @entity73 and @entity75 , putting a personal stamp on the action			0
@entity46 promises the experience will put players in the middle of a blockbuster @entity82 movie experience			0
and given the nontraditional @entity86 setting , this game should serve as a nice diversion from the crowded shooter genre			0
@entity90 ( @entity15 / @entity89 , @entity48 and @entity49 , 2013 ) although he 's appeared in video games like " @entity93 " and " @entity94 " before , the comic book antihero @entity90 has never stood on his own			1
for those not familiar with the wise - cracking " @entity90 , " @entity90 is about to leave a very lasting impression			1
@entity89 , which has done a great job with the original @entity100 games , is delivering a mature - rated adventure that features the brilliant voice acting of @entity103			2
the game allows players to slice and dice through enemies or go in guns blazing ( with some very big guns )			0
all the while , @entity90 is in on the fact that he 's starring in a game -- even breaking the fourth wall regularly			1
the game also highlights the character 's insanity by allowing players to hear the multiple voices in his head			2
which one you follow is completely up to you , but expect a funny , gory ride that 's nothing like other comic book games			1
@entity126 ( @entity127 / @entity128 , @entity49 , 2013 ) " @entity126 " looks unlike any other game you 've seen			0
this original action game takes place within a magical puppet theater			2
rather than sending the hero , who in this case is a boy named @entity138 who 's been transformed into a puppet , all of the action takes place on the same stage			1
in other words , the game world revolves around the character			2
this makes for a very unique world			2
also adding to the gameplay is an assortment of special heads that @entity138 , who 's headless , can pick up and use , along with his weapon , a magical pair of scissors			1
although this looks like a kids ' game , it 's actually very challenging			2
this boy - turned - puppet could be the next @entity159			2
@entity160 ( @entity162 / @entity161 , pc , @entity48 , @entity49 , 2013 ) @entity162 has been at the forefront of introducing gamers to strong female protagonists , which is one reason the " @entity169 " franchise has succeeded both in game and movie form			1
the @entity173 game publisher has debuted a brand new heroine , @entity174 , the star of the new science - fiction action game " @entity160 " from @entity178 development studio @entity176			1
@entity174 is not your typical action hero			0
sure , she 's well - trained in the martial arts , and looks good in heels			0
but she can also hack into people 's minds and steal or alter their memories			1
the game opens with @entity174 's own memory erased , setting her off on a quest to reclaim her identity that will ultimately change the world			2
and you can expect plenty of futuristic fighting action along the way			0
@entity196 ( @entity195 , @entity197 ) media molecule , the developer behind @entity127 's cross-platform franchise " @entity201 , " is at it again with this interactive world made completely of paper			1
" @entity196 " is a new adventure game that was designed to allow players to become part of the universe			0
using the @entity197 's rear touch pad , players can see their hand enter the game world			2
or they can shake the device and see the world crumble , or even turn upside down			0
players take control of @entity217 , a messenger from a paper dimension whose envelope head contains an urgent message that he must deliver to you			0
each message inside the envelope is different , providing a unique experience for the gamer , who becomes part of the experience			0
as the godlike player , it 's up to you to help @entity217 get that message to you			0
the struggling @entity197 needs more killer apps like this , which could lure more gamers to this portable player .			0

more than 270,000 people are attending @entity8 in @entity0 , @entity1
exhibitors from 40 countries are displaying games *due* out in coming *months*
@entity245 's " @entity90 " and a new @entity162 heroine in " @entity160 " stand out
quirky : you *'re* a headless puppet in " puppeteer " and in paper world in " *tearaway* "
