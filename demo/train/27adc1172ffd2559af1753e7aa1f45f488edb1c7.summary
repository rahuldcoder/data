@entity0 -- @entity3 's highest court has ruled that a lesbian couple married out of state can legally file for divorce , even though @entity3 's own same - sex marriage law does not take effect until next year			1
the issue is whether states without legalized same - sex marriage can recognize gay or lesbian weddings outside their borders			0
the appeal involved a @entity16 couple , @entity15 and @entity18 @entity17			1
" @entity3 courts will withhold recognition of a valid foreign marriage only if that marriage is ' repugnant ' to state public policy			1
this threshold , a high bar , has not been met yet , " the seven state court of appeals justices said in their 21 - page opinion			0
" the present case will be treated no differently			0
" the couple were married in a 2008 civil ceremony in @entity31 , during a short window when @entity33 recognized same - sex marriage			1
a voter referendum in @entity33 later outlawed same - sex marriage , but a federal appeals court recently ruled against that ban			1
it said such a ban was unconstitutional and singled out gays and lesbians for discrimination			0
the case appears to be headed to the @entity46 @entity45			0
the couple , who did not have children , settled in suburban @entity0			2
they eventually separated and filed for divorce in @entity3 when their relationship went sour , their attorneys have said			1
but a @entity3 judge denied the couple 's filing , ruling in 2010 that the divorce could not be recognized under the current state constitution			1
the " same sex marriage in which parties hereto participated is not valid pursuant to @entity3 law , " the judge said			1
" to recognize the alleged marriage would be contrary to public policy of @entity3			2
" @entity63 and @entity17 appealed , and the justices unanimously ordered the county court to grant the divorce , saying that " a valid out - of - state same - sex marriage should be treated by @entity3 courts as worthy of divorce			1
" gay rights group praised the ruling			0
" there are many same - sex spouses who married elsewhere who now live in @entity3 , " said @entity74 director @entity73			1
" this ruling ensures that they have all the same rights as any other married couple in @entity3			1
this is a powerful decision that will provide enormous security and protection to thousands of families			0
" @entity85 , director of constitutional litigation at @entity87 , said , " the high court of @entity3 confirmed today in this divorce case that out - of - state marriages of same - sex couples are entitled to legal recognition under longstanding principles of comity , allowing this couple the same access to a divorce as other married couples whose relationships have ended			1
" while the case highlights state differences in the recognition of same - sex marriages , analysts have said it will probably have little influence outside @entity3 because federal law allows states to ignore how other states define marriage			1
" this is simply going to be a case about the @entity3 state constitution , " said @entity110 , a law professor at the @entity111			1
gay rights activists say the matter often leaves same - sex couples in legal limbo when moving between states , claiming that @entity3 state courts have also inconsistently ruled on issues relating to same - sex marriages			2
" divorce is never easy , but when a couple has made the decision to end their marriage , there is no reason why the state should prevent them from ending their legal relationship and moving on with their lives , " said @entity122 , a spokesman for the @entity74			2
@entity3 gov. @entity136 signed into law a bill that allowed same - sex couples to wed. the law , however , is n't scheduled to take effect until january 1			1
the measure 's opponents have pledged to challenge it by holding a referendum during november 's election			0
the @entity148 group says it 's gathered thousands of signatures and is approaching the threshold required to put the issue on the ballot , adding further uncertainty to the @entity63 and @entity17 case			0
" if anything , it shows the nuttiness of the interim period , " @entity110 said of the unclear nature of @entity3 state law in apparent transition			1
a recent public opinion poll conducted by @entity164 - based firm @entity163 found that a slight majority of residents would vote for repealing the new law			2
of those responding , 43 % " would vote to make same - sex marriage illegal in @entity3 , while 40 % would vote to make it legal , " the poll said			2
the poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 4 %			0
" although this result is within the poll 's margin of error , it is the intensity of feeling among same - sex marriage opponents that causes the overall result to lean slightly towards repeal , " said @entity175 , @entity163 president			0
currently , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and the @entity0 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples			0
in february , @entity0 gov. @entity194 signed a bill into law that legalizes same - sex marriage , but it does not take effect until june			2
opponents there have pledged to block the bill , also calling for a referendum			0
five states -- @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 -- allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage			0
@entity212 residents voted this month to outlaw same - sex marriage , which was already prohibited in the state			0
a 1996 federal law known as the @entity216 would not force states to recognize same - sex marriages allowed in other states			0
that law -- now being challenged in federal court -- was not the case in the current dispute , the @entity3 high court said			1
" some states have elected not to recognize valid foreign same - sex marriages for purposes of domestic divorce proceedings , " the court said			0
" those states , unlike @entity3 , expressed clear public policies			2
