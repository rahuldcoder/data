he has seemingly succeeded everywhere he 's landed , but now , with the @entity4 crisis on his hands , @entity2 director @entity1 is being questioned at every turn			1
despite his assurances , how did @entity4 spread from one patient to another inside the @entity10 ? are hospitals truly equipped to handle @entity4 cases ? have the proper guidelines for treating patients been established ? @entity15 , who has been the director of the @entity2 since 2009 , attended top schools , fought infectious diseases and earned admirers along his rise			1
but faced with his biggest challenge -- the current @entity4 outbreak -- some are questioning if his experience and leadership style are enough to stop the virus from spreading in the @entity10			1
his public statements are increasingly being second - guessed , not just by the usual pundits , but by health care workers			2
if anything , @entity1 has been consistent since the epidemic broke out in @entity31 , and then eventually spread to the @entity10			1
it 's a deadly disease			0
but we know how to stop it , " he said last week			0
@entity1 has repeated this line many times : " we know how to stop @entity4			1
" but then a @entity38 national in @entity39 was diagnosed with the virus			0
and last week , a nurse who cared for that man was confirmed to have @entity4			1
in his role , @entity1 has to thread the needle : acknowledge fear , while appealing for calm			1
@entity1 , described by friends as shy and hardworking , has had success virtually everywhere he 's been			1
his track record reflects well on him , though he has faced criticism from conservative voices who viewed his efforts to ban smoking and trans fat from restaurants in @entity58 as the creation of a " nanny state			2
" the general distrust of government that the political right holds has been on display as the @entity4 fight is on			1
" difficult taking anything ( the @entity2 and ) @entity1 say seriously , " conservative radio host @entity66 said on @entity67 , citing low confidence in what she sees as lies or guessing on the issue			1
after the news that a @entity39 nurse had become the first person to contract @entity4 inside the @entity10 , the @entity2 director almost immediately said that a breach of protocol had occurred			1
the insinuation that maybe the nurse did something wrong brought new criticism against @entity1 , this time without a political agenda			1
the group @entity84 spoke to reporters after @entity1 's remarks , some holding up signs that said , " stop blaming nurses			1
" @entity90 , a nurse and vice president of the group , told @entity93 's @entity92 that in cases such as this , the nurses always get blamed unfairly			0
" and in this particular case , they said it was a breach of protocol			0
but what was the protocol ? " she said			0
" was it enough that the nurse and the patient is protected ? " " it 's not enough that they put out guidelines			0
it has to be fully enforced , " she added			0
@entity1 on monday said state and federal health officials are re-examining the protocols , including the removal of protective gear after contact with an @entity4 patient and if it might be helpful to spray virus - killing solution on workers as they leave an isolation unit			1
ebola : five ways the @entity2 got it wrong focus on data in @entity1 's view , data is king			1
" the real challenge is -- first and foremost -- basing decision - making on data , " @entity1 said			1
" you know it sounds wonky and uninteresting , but when it comes down to it , that 's what we want to do			0
" @entity141 on data can ensure that plans work out as they were designed to , he said			0
@entity58 health commissioner dr. @entity144 , who worked with @entity1 when he held that role , said she witnessed @entity1 's faith in the numbers			1
@entity1 began his career at the @entity2 by working on controlling tuberculosis , and then spent years stamping out the disease in @entity151 , as a @entity2 assignee to the @entity153			1
when @entity1 arrived in @entity58 as health commissioner , there were about a thousand cases of @entity156 in the city , @entity144 recalled			2
it was @entity1 's specialty , but he went in a different direction with his resources			2
" he did n't say , ' i 'm going to halve the cases of @entity156 , ' " @entity144 said			0
" he said , ' i 'm going to drive down tobacco use			0
' " that was a decision based on data , she said			0
" @entity167 was and continues to be a leading preventable cause of death in @entity58 and the country			0
" ask @entity1 what he considers the high point of his career , and he will refer to the time he spent in @entity151 , said dr. @entity174 , an epidemiologist and historian who has followed @entity1 's work			1
the impact of @entity1 's work in @entity151 helped about half a million people , so " that 's not a strange answer from him because he 's very interested in numbers			2
and he 's going for the largest numbers for the larger impact			0
" what data has resulted in @entity1 's confidence in the ability to stop @entity4 ? will the recent cases change his calculus ? a listener @entity1 has a blog on the @entity2 website , which mostly consists of news articles and thoughts from the director			1
the blog is hardly remarkable , but because it allows comments , it is ostensibly one way for the public to put their opinions in front of him			0
many of the comments come from people who identify themselves as health care workers , and are not always kind			0
" as a registered nurse , i 'm here to tell you that i am losing confidence in your ' expertise ' ! " one commenter wrote			0
another person wrote , " for a guy who is so sure about ' stopping @entity4 in its tracks , ' i see the disease spreading			2
" it 's unlikely that the @entity2 director will see these comments , but what if he did ? could these voices of concern influence him ? one thing that @entity144 recalled about working with @entity1 in @entity58 is that he " soaks up information from anybody			2
" " so , it would n't matter to him how many letters you had behind your name ( from ) all of your degrees , " @entity144 said			0
" if you had information that he felt was interesting , if you were driving a bus , sitting at a desk , entering data on a computer -- he wanted to talk to you and find out how that person might perceive things , what their advice might be			0
" if the director is interested in hearing suggestions , they are piling up from other health care professionals and members of the public interested enough about the @entity4 outbreak to post a message on his blog			2
in his career , @entity1 , a graduate of @entity251 and @entity252 , has undoubtedly over-achieved and saved thousands of lives			2
his is a background that inspires confidence , and he has shown that in his messages on @entity4			2
but there is one caveat about being overly confident			0

dr. @entity1 has found success nearly everywhere
now some are questioning his leadership on the @entity4 crisis
those who know him say he is confident and data - driven
will the rising tide of criticism shift his views ?
