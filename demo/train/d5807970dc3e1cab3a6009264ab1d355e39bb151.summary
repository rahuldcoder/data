-- she 's won a new trial			2
and now , @entity3 may learn wednesday whether she can get out of prison while she waits for that trial			0
in a @entity8 , @entity9 , court , a judge is expected to decide if @entity10 will be released on bond in a case that has drawn national attention			1
in september an appellate court ordered a new trial for @entity10 , who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband			1
the case will be retried because the jury had incorrect directions , the court ruled			0
@entity10 's case gained the attention of civil rights leaders , who say nobody was hurt and the sentence for the mother of three was too harsh			2
the case shined the spotlight on @entity9 's @entity31 after she unsuccessfully argued before her 2012 trial that she was immune to prosecution because of the law			0
but now , @entity10 says she 's just hoping she can see her children as she waits for her complicated case to be resolved			1
@entity10 " has not had regular access to her 3 - and - a - half year old daughter " since she was 6 months old , her lawyer said in court documents urging a judge for a pre-trial release			1
but a lawyer for @entity10 's estranged husband , @entity46 , says he has concerns			1
" she had bond once on this case and she went over to my client 's house and she gave him a black eye , and got arrested , though she was told to stay away from my client , so i do n't think he necessarily wants her to have a bond again , " said @entity48 , @entity46 's attorney			0

state attorney @entity83 had said the case deserved to be prosecuted because @entity10 fired in the direction of a room where children were standing			1
@entity88 had said she offered @entity10 a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three - year prison sentence , but @entity10 chose to take the case to a jury trial , where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a @entity9 law known as " 10 - 20 - life			2
" the law mandates increased penalties for some felonies , including aggravated assault , in which a gun is carried or used			0
