-- she was named @entity2 , after the daughter of the man who found her , and she got to go home wednesday			1
for her , home is the waters of the @entity8 , a place no one expected she 'd ever return to			0
@entity2 is a 115 - pound federally protected loggerhead sea turtle who , if not for sheer luck , would be dead today			1
in early august , a father and son fishing in the @entity8 spotted @entity2 floating with a 4 - foot spear sticking out of her head			1
the loggerhead was taken to the @entity18			2
" this has to be one of the luckiest turtles in history , " said veterinarian @entity19			1
the odds of saving @entity2 were not good			1
the spear had gone in just behind her ear and lodged against the jawbone on the other side			2
" quarter of an inch in either direction , " said @entity19 , " and the animal would be dead			0
" the shooting of the turtle had to be deliberate , said @entity35 , who runs the @entity18 in @entity36			2
from the angle of entry it appeared to the medical team that @entity2 had been shot from above , probably from a boat			1
" everyone in the @entity8 was absolutely offended that someone would come down and do that to one of our turtles , " @entity35 said			2
he said he does not believe whoever shot the turtle was from the @entity8			2
the spear was much bigger than what locals would normally use , he noted			2
the day after the turtle was rescued , @entity35 took a picture of the spear to every dive shop in the area			1
he hoped the person who shot the turtle would come looking for a replacement and someone in that shop could make an identification			0
doctors who first looked at the injured turtle said that with each breath she took , they could hear a fluttering sound			0
after stabilizing @entity2 and giving her antibiotics , @entity19 was able to remove the spear from her head and the flutter ended			1
@entity2 is a young turtle , about 12 years old			1
it was only a week ago she started eating on her own , gobbling up some squid			0
once that happened , @entity35 said , " we knew it was time for her to go back home			0
" a $ 16,000 reward is offered for tips that lead to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the injury			0
much of the money came from local commercial fishermen and boat captains			0
the @entity91 's @entity90 is investigating			0
the staff at the @entity18 sees many accidental injuries , " animals tied up in fishing line or hit by a boat , " @entity35 said			0
" when we see something like this , intentional , it 's rare			0
" it 's even rarer for a turtle to survive and recover so quickly from the kind of damage @entity2 suffered			1
under a beautiful blue september morning sky , @entity2 was released near the @entity106 in @entity36			1
for the volunteers , the doctors , and @entity35 , this was the kind of day that makes them smile .			0
