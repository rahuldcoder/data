@entity0 -- @entity3 's prime minister , @entity2 , was re-elected chairman of his @entity4 , or @entity4 , at a boisterous party rally sunday attended by throngs of supporters as well as foreign leaders			1
at the @entity4 party congress , @entity2 once again sought to cement the role of the @entity4 not only as a party that has reshaped @entity3 politics but also as a role model for regional democratic @entity16 movements in the wake of the @entity18			1
in a two - and - a - half - hour speech , delivered in front of an adoring crowd of party delegates , @entity2 detailed his party 's achievements after nearly a decade in power , while also laying out a road map for what his role could be in the future			1
" we have shown , both at home and abroad , that a country with a @entity34 population can have a thriving and advanced democracy , " said @entity2 , who called the @entity4 a " conservative democratic party			1
" " this understating that we have put forth has gone beyond our borders and has practically become an example to all @entity34 countries , " he announced to an audience that included @entity40 president @entity39 as well as @entity41 , head of the @entity43 regional government in @entity44			1
few answers in @entity49 @entity2 , who won his party 's chairmanship for the third time on sunday with 1,421 votes , has reached the @entity4 's term limit			1
what his role will be after that has been the source of much debate in @entity3			0
@entity2 told delegates that he will continue to serve and that , " this is not a goodbye but a pause in the notes of a song			2
" " one of the most important aspects of the convention was the message that the prime minister is not going anywhere , " @entity65 , a former @entity4 parliamentarian and director of the @entity67 based in @entity68 , wrote in an e-mail to @entity1			2
" instead he will try to become a president who can maintain his party affiliation , or will try to change the system into a presidential or semi-presidential system , " he wrote			0
@entity82 conflict escalating , report says @entity3 critics regularly accuse @entity2 of authoritarian tendencies , citing the arrests of scores of journalists and hundreds of political rivals in recent years			1
some commentators have warned that a presidential system could weaken democracy in @entity3			0
" this was mainly about consolidating his own power and thickening the cement on which his party stands on , " @entity92 , a columnist for the newspaper @entity93 , said in an interview with @entity1			0
" he does not take for granted that he needs a broader base to become a fully empowered president			0
either he will seek a more reformist base or he will go more conservative , omitting ' democrat ' from ' conservative democrat , ' " said @entity92			0
refugees languish in squalor at @entity3 border the @entity4 's internal constitution was amended during the party congress to allow parliamentarians who have already served three terms -- such as @entity2 -- to be re-elected after sitting out an election cycle			1
the party congress also led to the appointment of a slew of new names to the central coordination committee of the @entity4			1
some political analysts said the choice of appointees signaled @entity2 appeared to be making overtures to the conservative side of the political spectrum , ahead of municipal elections next october			2
however , one notable change included the removal of @entity2 's interior minister from one of the @entity4 's top leadership councils			1
interior minister @entity130 's hawkish stance towards @entity3 's long - simmering @entity82 conflict has sparked controversy both within the @entity4 and throughout @entity3			2
" as of today , we want to turn to a blank page and write in it with our @entity82 brothers			0
we want to protect that page from terror and make it a new page of peace and brotherhood , " said @entity2			2
his remarks echoed themes of previous speeches , when @entity2 's government launched a series of reforms aimed at relaxing cultural restrictions on @entity82 in @entity3			2
as part of what was described as the " democratic opening , " the @entity3 state established a @entity82 - language tv channel for the first time and eased bans on @entity82 language education in schools			0
but the peace overtures have failed to bring an end to an insurgency that has claimed the lives of more than 30,000 people over the last three decades			0
over the last year , violence has spiked in predominantly @entity82 southeastern @entity3 to deadly levels unseen in more than a decade			0
after winning numerous elections since his party first swept to power in 2002 , @entity2 appears to have a popular mandate under @entity3 's constitution , which was written by a military junta in the 1980s			1
a new constitution could conceivably expand rights for @entity3 's restive @entity82 minority			0
but that process has stalled amid disagreements with opposition political parties , who accuse the @entity4 of trying to rewrite the constitution unilaterally			1
