-- @entity1 may have her critics , but @entity4 's talkative virtual assistant is definitely useful for some functions , like checking the weather and texting			1
@entity7 , which works with @entity4 on voice control , now plans to take @entity1 - like abilities to more apps			1
the product is called @entity12 , and it 'll let businesses build voice capabilities right into their apps -- @entity16 or @entity17 -- via a software development kit ( @entity19 )			1
@entity7 says it 's the first voice assistant with an @entity19 ( @entity1 still does n't have one ) , and @entity12 obviously has access to all of @entity7 's data on the industries that use its tech : banks , airlines , hotels , retailers and more			1
@entity12 is aimed at the enterprise , essentially taking the automated call center functions you might encounter when calling an 800 number , and putting it into an app. @entity0 : here 's the most stunning photo of @entity36 the world has ever seen " @entity12 takes natural - language understanding , and it provides a way for a developer to add that into an app , " says @entity38 , executive vice president of @entity7 's enterprise division			1
in a demo at @entity0 's offices , @entity7 reps showed us a mock banking app equipped with @entity12			2
responding to commands like " pay my bill , " or even " pay the full balance on my @entity54 bill on august first , " @entity12 performed tasks that would probably take complex navigation in one step			0
@entity0 : what does @entity1 know about the @entity59 ? @entity12 is dependent on @entity7 's @entity60 , so she wo n't work without a network connection			1
and as we discovered in the demo , her speed and ability to parse longer phrases depend on the quality of that connection			0
using a @entity70 modem , @entity12 had trouble figuring out the longer bill - paying command above , but on @entity74 she executed it almost instantly			0
@entity12 also happens to sound almost exactly like @entity1 , though @entity7 says businesses will be able to choose from 40 different voices , and even be able to customize it with their own voice " persona , " if they have one			2
one of the major differences between @entity12 and @entity1 is voice biometrics , which means @entity12 can actually tell that it 's you talking , and not someone who just picked up your phone			2
this can act as both a security and convenience feature -- after all , passwords become redundant if the app can tell it 's the right person speaking just by voice			0
@entity0 : @entity94 ditches apps for @entity96 and 3 other products " for the first time on a mobile device , our virtual assistant does n't just understand what you said and what you want , we can actually understand who said it , " says @entity38			0
@entity7 is releasing the @entity19 for @entity12 today , and the company says the first crop of apps incorporating the service should arrive in the fall			0
what apps would you like to see @entity12 built into ? share your ideas in the comments			0

@entity12 , a voice - control product like @entity4 's @entity1 , will be equipped for @entity16 and @entity17 apps
unlike @entity1 , @entity12 will allow other companies to use voice - control capabilities
@entity12 is aimed at app developers , service industries
@entity12 needs a strong network connection to work correctly
