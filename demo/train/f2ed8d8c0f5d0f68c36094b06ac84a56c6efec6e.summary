-- the sun had not risen yet on that february day in 1986 when @entity7 's eight - vehicle motorcade of luxury cars and jeeps arrived at the @entity3 airport , then named for his father			1
surrounded by soldiers and about 100 journalists who came to witness the end of an era in @entity15 , the dictator boarded a @entity17 c - 141 jet along with his glamorous wife , @entity19 , their two children and 20 friends and servants			0
also on the plane that day were trunks of designer clothes , gold , jewels and priceless art. what could not be seen was the hundreds of millions of dollars @entity15 officials accused the @entity7 clan of stealing from state coffers			1
the pillaging of @entity15 's national treasury now lies at the heart of legal action against @entity7 , who stunned the world by returning to @entity15 this week from some 25 years of quiet exile in @entity39			1
some lawyers who have been following the @entity7 money trail for years were flabbergasted that such a man was able to enter @entity15 legally , that he was not arrested right away			1
" i do n't know how a criminal like him goes free , " said @entity43 , a @entity44 - based lawyer who has been representing the @entity15 government in a long and drawn out legal battle over @entity7 's cash			1
@entity7 reportedly lost a chunk of his wealth when he and @entity52 divorced , but the family still has $ 5.7 million in assets in a frozen bank account in @entity44 that belongs to a family foundation			2
now , a @entity44 law enacted specifically to help repatriate stolen funds from failing states may help return the @entity7 money to @entity15 , said @entity61 , executive director of the @entity62 in @entity44			1
" i am optimistic there will be a decision by the end of the year , " he said			0
the law , which goes into effect february 1 , was enacted to help @entity44 overcome existing hurdles with states that have no mutual legal assistance partnership with @entity44 or with troubled nations that are incapable of dealing with such issues , according to the @entity44 @entity72			0
for a judge order restitution , a government must prove a discrepancy between the wealth of a " politically exposed person " and his or her earnings , along with high levels of corruption in that country			0
" they managed to draft this law very quickly , " @entity43 said , adding that legal proceedings in @entity15 would not affect efforts at restitution			0
he said $ 5.7 million is not a large amount compared to what @entity7 allegedly stole , but morally , repatriation of the money would be a huge victory			2
but not a complete one until @entity7 is made to stand trial for his alleged crimes , said human rights lawyer @entity97 , who has worked in @entity15 on building the legal case against @entity7			1
@entity97 said no one in @entity15 ever imagined that @entity7 would return to face charges			2
his presence in the country has enabled the court to reopen a 2008 case against the strongman , he said			0
but @entity7 's lawyer , @entity106 , expressed confidence wednesday that @entity15 authorities have little evidence to press charges			1
@entity7 , said @entity106 , would not only remain a free man but he could decide to return to politics			0
@entity106 later told @entity0 that @entity7 had given " all that money " to charity for @entity15 relief after the earthquake			1
" i do n't know if the @entity44 bank transferred that money already , so i do n't have any details on that , " @entity106 said , " but i guarantee you that that has been done			0
" dismayed by the thought of the return of a brutal dictator , @entity43 pressed upon @entity15 's justice system to prevail , and for the courts not to forget what @entity7 pledged in the aftermath of @entity15 's devastating 2010 earthquake			2
he expressed " complete solidarity " with those who were suffering in " these hours of great national distress " and called on @entity44 authorities to transfer all of the money from his foundation to the @entity133 for the relief effort			2
@entity43 doubted @entity7 's sincerity but not the new @entity44 law			1
" this money will go back to @entity15 for sure , " he said			0
" it will never go back to @entity7			0

new : @entity7 's lawyer says " all that money " has been given for @entity15 relief
a new @entity44 law will ease repatriation of funds
a government lawyer in @entity15 says the money will never go back to @entity7
@entity7 may be charged in @entity15 for pillaging state coffers
