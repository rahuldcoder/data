-- although it did n't set a franchise record , " @entity3 : breaking @entity4 -- @entity9 1 " had one of the best openings in box - office history by debuting to $ 139.5 million , according to studio estimates			1
that 's the fifth - best opening weekend ever , behind " @entity11 and the @entity12 -- part 2 , " " @entity13 , " " @entity15 3 , " and " @entity3 : @entity16 , " which held on to the franchise record			1
" @entity16 " debuted to a slightly better $ 142.8 million on the same november weekend two years ago			2
what 's interesting is how closely " @entity20 " followed " @entity16 's " trajectory			2
" @entity16 " grossed $ 72.7 million its first day , and then dropped 42 percent on saturday and 34 percent on sunday			1
by comparison , " @entity20 " earned $ 72 million on friday ( the third - best opening day ever ) , and then fell 44 percent on saturday and a projected 34 percent today			1
" @entity16 " ultimately finished its domestic run with $ 296.6 million , and it 's too early to tell whether " @entity20 " will wind up a bit short of that final figure			1
even if it does , @entity28 wo n't be complaining about grossing nearly $ 300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise			2
and , of course , the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here			0
" @entity20 " took in $ 144 million from 54 foreign territories this week , pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $ 283.5 million			1
@entity28 reports that " @entity20 " attracted a crowd that was , unsurprisingly , 80 percent female			1
what is surprising is that the @entity44 movie 's audience was n't as young as you 'd think , with 60 percent over the age of 21			0
according to @entity49 , 30 percent of the film 's audience was under 18 , but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34			0
the popular conception is that the " @entity54 " is merely a teenage phenomenon , but these figures seem to prove otherwise			0
the $ 110 million movie received a good - but - not - great b + rating from @entity49 graders			1
in second place was @entity60 animated sequel " @entity59 , " which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $ 22 million			1
the 2006 original , an @entity64 winner for best animated feature , opened to $ 41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of @entity60 surcharges			2
" @entity59 " was saddled with mediocre reviews , which might have discouraged some parents			2
furthermore , five years could have been too long of a wait , especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor			0
the original " @entity59 " was released a year after @entity74 , when the @entity76 birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist			0
that moment has clearly passed			0
the $ 135 million sequel earned a b + rating from @entity49 moviegoers , and @entity60 theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally			1
the rest of the top five consisted of holdovers			0
the @entity60 action flick " immortals " dropped a harsh 62 percent for $ 12.3 million -- a second - weekend decline that was larger than both " 300 " ( 54 percent ) and " @entity90 " ( 57 percent )			1
" @entity93 " witnessed a typical @entity92 fall of 52 percent for $ 12 million			2
and even though " @entity59 " underperformed , " @entity96 " lost much of its family audience			0
the animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $ 10.7 million in its fourth weekend			1
in limited release , @entity98 's " @entity99 , " starring @entity100 , debuted to $ 1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth - place finish			2
the @entity64 hopeful raked in an impressive $ 42,150 per location			0
only " midnight in @entity109 , " " @entity110 , " and " @entity111 " opened to stronger per - theater averages this year , and those movies started out on far fewer screens than " @entity99			0
the @entity54 : breaking @entity4 -- part 1 -- $ 139.5 mil 2			0
@entity59 -- $ 22.0 mil 3			1
immortals -- $ 12.3 mil 4			1
@entity93 -- $ 12.0 mil 5			0
