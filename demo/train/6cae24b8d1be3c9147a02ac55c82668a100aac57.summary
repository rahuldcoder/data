-- the @entity3 - @entity2 painter @entity1 once told me that painting expresses the thoughts we struggle to put into words			1
faced with this challenge , " it 's easier to learn @entity10 ! " he joked , his wit shining through , even though alzheimer 's disease had already begun its slow , relentless onslaught on his mind			0
@entity1 , widely regarded as one of the foremost @entity3 contemporary painters of the 20th century , passed away at his home in @entity19 on tuesday at the age of 93			1
born in @entity21 in 1920 , he formed part of the second generation of @entity3 artists to turn westward in their search for inspiration			2
encouraged by the @entity2 - educated @entity3 artist @entity27 , his teacher at the prestigious @entity28 ( today the @entity28 ) , he relocated to @entity29 in 1948			1
although he did not know it at the time , the move would be permanent , due in part to the rapidly changing political situation in @entity34			2
apart from brief trips abroad , @entity1 would remain in @entity2 until the year before his death , one of the few @entity3 artists from his generation to emigrate to @entity39			1
embraced by @entity2 , he was elected to the prestigious @entity41 society in 2002 and received the legion of honor in 2006 from then - president @entity43			1
for @entity1 and his contemporaries , @entity29 represented the source of modern art. living there meant direct access to the paintings that he had until then only encountered as black - and - white reproductions in art magazines			1
an oil painter by vocation , he immersed himself in the riches that surrounded him -- heading directly to the @entity56 on the very day he arrived in the city			0
meanwhile , with the assistance of his friend and mentor , noted poet and painter @entity61 , and blessed with the warm charm and wit that would impress me decades later , @entity1 cultivated an extensive circle of fellow artists and cultural figures			1
in just a few years , he established himself as an integral member of the postwar @entity2 art world			2
@entity1 worked hard to find his artistic voice			2
at first he made a determined effort to distance himself from ink painting -- the medium most closely associated with the @entity3 painting tradition -- and subject matter that might be construed as overtly @entity3			2
he wished to be appreciated on his own merits and not to fall victim to stereotype			0
his breakthrough , however , came with his 1954 masterpiece " @entity90 , " a painting that was both his first purely abstract work and a return to his origins : the inky black forms rising in two wavering columns are abstractions of oracle bone characters -- the most ancient of @entity3 scripts			2
in the decades that followed , @entity1 committed himself fully to abstract painting , rarely using even figurative titles after 1959			0
instead , he titled his works with their date of completion , marking their entry into the world			0
the lyrical qualities that defined him as an artist appeared early on , first in his oil paintings and later in his ink paintings , after his reengagement with the medium in the early 1970s : oscillating planes of color , light , and shade met , collided , and diverged , skidding across the surface of his works			0
the apparent disorder of his paintings concealed an underlying structure , sometimes described as @entity113 in nature , which bore striking parallels to a similar balance between order and chaos found in @entity3 traditional painting			0
in @entity1 's case , this phenomenon is perhaps best understood as a self - statement : the artist 's insistence on his personal and aesthetic identity in the face of the vagaries of borders and time			1
@entity1 's given name , " @entity130 - ki " ( or " @entity131 " in the standard @entity132 used in @entity34 ) , means " no boundaries			1
" no single phrase better encapsulates the union in his person and art of the two often disparate cultures and aesthetic visions of @entity2 and @entity34			1
" @entity2 thought and @entity3 thought are not the same , " he told me			1
" it 's hard to translate between them			0
sometimes you must wear yourself out trying to understand			0
painting must express these feelings			0
" an artist friend once asked about my research			0
hearing that i studied @entity1 , he grew suddenly pensive			0
" @entity1 , " he mused , " his work is n't representative of either @entity3 or @entity2 art. " " yes , " i answered			1
" he represents himself , and that is enough			0

@entity3 - @entity2 painter @entity1 died tuesday at age 93
@entity1 was regarded as one of foremost @entity3 contemporary painters of the 20th century
@entity1 was uniquely able to *combine* cultures , aesthetic visions of @entity2 and @entity34 in his work
