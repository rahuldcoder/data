-- people up and down the @entity2 could feel the effects from this week 's epic flooding long after the water recedes			1
farmers may face a major disruption to their livelihood in places where the @entity10 opens spillways to drain water from the swollen river onto adjacent land			2
" if you have a pasture where you grow soybeans and it gets flooded by 25 feet of floodwaters and you end up with 3 feet of oozing mud on top of your pasture , it 's going to be a long time before you can plow -- certainly one year , " said @entity15 , a professor of sedimentary geology at @entity17 in @entity18			1
" it might be arable next year , but it would probably be quite difficult to work			0
" there 's also a chance that floodwaters could spill into wetlands and damage oyster beds near where the @entity2 meets the @entity33			1
" they do n't like to be buried in mud , " said @entity34 of the oysters			0
@entity38 is former deputy director of the @entity39 and now a private consultant			0
how bad will it be in @entity42 , where the swollen @entity2 is headed ? experts held out hope that the floodwaters forecast for much of the @entity46 will exact a minimum toll in lives lost			1
yet they appeared resigned to the likelihood of steep property losses			0
if a system of levees holds , then floodwater will be discharged only where the @entity10 plans to discharge water , @entity15 said			1
" there will be property lost , hopefully no lives , but according to a plan executed by the @entity10 as opposed to a rapidly unfolding catastrophe , " he said			0
a failure in the system of levees would change the landscape considerably , he said , though he does not expect that			1
" i would n't say that this is going to be a disaster , but the modern @entity2 levee system has never been tested under flood conditions like this , " he said			1
" it 's probably going to exceed water levels not seen since the @entity71 of 1927 -- historically the largest ever measured			2
" that flood led @entity73 in 1928 to authorize the @entity10 to build the system of levees and other controls now under stress			1
farmers in parts of @entity42 could face a long recovery , particularly if authorities open the @entity81 near @entity82 to lower water levels on the @entity2			1
@entity84 , a professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the @entity87 at @entity17 , predicted it will take weeks to months for the farmland to dry			1
" any existing crops are going to be toast , " he said , citing the fields of corn , sugar cane and soybeans that will be covered with sediment			0
" plus , @entity96 knows what 's in the water and what gets deposited			2
" if the floodwaters remain on the ground for 30 days or so , " then we probably would not be able to get a crop in this year , " said @entity103 , president of @entity104 , an agricultural consultant firm in @entity105 , @entity42			0
" most of our crops are already planted in the floodplains			0
" he said he was comfortable that the levee would hold , but added that , if it breaks , " that would be a catastrophe ... it could be years before we could replace that infrastructure			1
" any farmers who wind up losing a year 's worth of crops will likely be forced out of the business , since insurance would not cover their losses adequately , he said			2
in all , @entity15 predicted , the floods will affect three major areas in the @entity124 , which begins around @entity18 and ends in the @entity33			1
some 80 miles north of @entity18 , the @entity125 diverges from the @entity2 and flows down to the @entity33			1
the entire @entity126 will get from 5 feet to 25 feet of water going down the @entity125 , whose surroundings are less populated than the area around the @entity2			1
" it 's a safer place to discharge water in terms of the human cost , " he said			2
" at the same time , there are tens of thousands of people who live there			0
" the second area of significance is @entity141 , a major estuary north of @entity143 that will receive floodwater from the @entity145			0
@entity15 predicted that the fertilizer and waste deposited in @entity141 will result in " extensive " blooms of algae by midsummer			1
" this is essentially a large , unplanned sediment transport experiment , " he said , adding that he plans to study how effectively coastal bays , lakes and estuaries trap sediment to build new land			0
the ratio of how much is deposited versus how much is washed out by tides determines how fast land can be built , " which is what we need to do in order to rebuild the @entity162 , " he said			0
the third area is the @entity2 below @entity143 , which is protected by " very low and relatively weak levees , " @entity15 said			1
though the area is largely unpopulated , it is a major navigational channel			0
were any place in the @entity2 system to experience a breach in a levee , that could lead to a change in the river channel , he said			1
he pointed to areas near the town of @entity175 as particularly vulnerable			0
" those are areas where the levees get low and weak			2
" under the best - case scenario , the @entity10 will prove able to manage the water flow and flooding will be minor			0
but there is little doubt that property will be lost and the economy will take a hit , @entity84 said			1
" on the other hand , the worst - case scenario is that the water rises , we 're not able to manage it , it finds the weak areas , exploits those vulnerabilities , perhaps even segments of the river levee get taken out by erosion or collapse due to failure of saturated levees or other things could happen -- ships get loose in the river , barges of chemicals run into the side of the levee			1
" if levees break , weeks could pass before engineers could reseal them , he said			2
but @entity84 said his worst - case scenario might not tell the whole story			2
" there are unintended consequences that are going to happen that we ca n't possibly even fathom right now , " he said			0
" we just have to be ready for it , and get people out of the way			0
" if wide - scale flooding occurs , the resulting economic damage will be felt for years , he predicted			0
" any city that ever floods never really returns economically to where it once was because people do n't have confidence , people do n't want to put businesses there			0
@entity143 is the big example			0
" already , even before the slow - motion disaster has unfolded , policymakers should have learned some lessons , he said			0
one of them is that flood plains should not have been developed			2
" nature wins in the end , " he said , " and i just hope that we 've done enough planning that we can basically at least hold it back this one more time			2
" " we should really be thinking about whether we want to continue to live in really stupid places , because nature is going to exploit our stupidity , " @entity84 said .			1

@entity244 prevails that the levee system for the @entity2 will hold
" landscape changes considerably " if levees fail , expert @entity15 says
the levee system " never been tested under flood conditions like this "
" nature is going to exploit our stupidity , " says @entity17 's @entity84
