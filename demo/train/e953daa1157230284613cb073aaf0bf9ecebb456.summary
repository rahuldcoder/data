since 2009 the @entity0 has mandated that @entity1 and other emergency contraceptives be available without a prescription to women age 17 and up			1
in reality , a new study suggests , a 17 - year - old 's access to these drugs can be uncertain			2
in the study , two female research assistants at @entity10 called every commercial pharmacy in five major cities and asked whether emergency contraception was available to them that day			1
if the answer was yes , they followed up with the question " if i 'm 17 , is that okay ? " at that point , 19 % of the pharmacy workers told the young women that contraception would not be available to them			2
when researchers posing as doctors called the same pharmacies on behalf of a ( fictional ) 17 - year - old patient , however , just 3 % of pharmacies said the drugs were n't available			2
pharmacies , moreover , incorrectly reported the age guidelines for over-the - counter access to 43 % of the " girls " and 39 % of the " doctors , " according to the study , which appears in the april issue of the journal @entity36			1
@entity37 : 12 types of birth control : what are the options ? misinformation of this sort could lead to unintended pregnancies , the researchers say			0
" it 's important that adolescents get the correct information the first time , " says @entity46 , @entity47 , the lead author of the study and a professor of pediatrics at @entity10			0
" this highlights some of the barriers that adolescents face when accessing emergency contraception			1
" two emergency contraceptives , both of which contain the hormone levonorgestrel , are approved for over-the - counter use and are stocked behind pharmacy counters : @entity1 ( including the single - pill version known as @entity66 ) , and a so - called branded generic known as @entity67			0
timely access to these drugs is important , @entity70 and her colleagues say , since they 're most effective in the 24 hours following unprotected sex or a contraception failure			1
the odds of getting pregnant rise by about 50 % every 12 hours after the event , according to the study			1
@entity37 : what to do if the condom breaks the study included every pharmacy -- nearly 950 in all -- in @entity83 , @entity84 ; @entity85 ; @entity86 , @entity87 ; @entity88 ; and @entity89 , @entity90			0
researchers contacted each pharmacy twice , once in the role of the teenager and once in the role of the doctor			0
to better disguise their identity , they spaced the calls at least two weeks apart and used cell phones programmed with each city 's area code			0
in roughly 20 % of the phone calls , pharmacy workers reported that emergency contraception was not available for any caller or patient , regardless of age			1
some of those pharmacies -- about one - third -- suggested another nearby pharmacy or offered to order the pills , but the average wait time was 45 hours			0
the faulty information about age recorded in some of the other calls might be due to a combination of " confusion , misinformation , and maybe personal beliefs , " @entity70 says , although she and her colleagues stress that the study is silent on this matter			2
a pharmacy 's location and whether or not it was part of a chain did not appear to play a role			0
as for the differences in the responses given to doctors versus teenagers , @entity70 says it could be that physicians are more likely to be transferred to higher - ranking pharmacy employees -- pharmacists rather than pharmacy technicians , say			2
similarly , the study notes that teenagers were twice as likely as doctors to be put on hold			1
@entity37 : what your teenager needs to know about sex experts not involved in the study say that several factors -- unintentional or otherwise -- could be responsible for the misinformation			2
" there were probably some people who had some personal objections about [ emergency contraception ] and did n't want to deal with it , and some were not educated about the laws and facts , " says @entity150 , @entity47 , an assistant professor of ob - gyn at the @entity152			1
@entity160 , @entity47 , an associate professor of ob - gyn at the @entity162 , in @entity163 , has studied access to emergency contraception in @entity167 pharmacies and says barriers to access are often logistical			1
rural pharmacies , for instance , may not stock the pill simply because too few people ask for it			0
@entity160 has encountered ideological objections as well , however			0
although @entity1 and @entity67 are believed to work by preventing ovulation , like daily birth control pills , and " will not interrupt an established pregnancy , " @entity160 says , some people view taking the drugs as tantamount to abortion			0
the " misunderstanding among the public , pharmacists , and doctors about this being an abortion pill " is an " ongoing dilemma , " @entity160 says			0
@entity37 : common birth control side effects the @entity0 lowered the age threshold for over-the - counter access to emergency contraception from 18 to 17 in 2009 , following a federal court order			1
girls age 16 and under still require a prescription from a doctor			0
in 2011 , the @entity0 recommended the removal of all age restrictions on @entity1 one - step , but in a controversial move , the @entity198 @entity197 , @entity199 , overruled the agency			2
@entity202 , @entity47 , senior director of medical services at @entity204 , which provides reproductive health services -- including emergency contraception -- at more than 800 health centers around the country , says easing restrictions on emergency contraception may help address the uneven access seen in @entity70 's study			1
" it 's unclear if the pharmacy workers who provided incorrect information to the study callers were simply unfamiliar with the law , but one of the unfortunate results of the age restriction is that it requires drugstores to keep emergency contraception behind pharmacy counters , " @entity202 said in a prepared statement			1
" as the research shows , that restriction creates access barriers for women of all ages and these barriers can in turn result in preventable unintended pregnancies			0
