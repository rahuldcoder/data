-- it was a beautiful -- no , a perfect -- day			2
until a kindly but clueless grandma asked the question that must never be posed to any woman , ever			1
in the spirit of forgiveness , this columnist resolves to breathe in and let go ... but not before recalling a landfill of grudges , slights , insults , and snarky remarks			1
about three weeks after my daughter , @entity16 , was born , i was standing in line at @entity18 , a lovely little shoebox of a shop that 's been serving the most exquisite @entity22 delicacies ever since mr. @entity23 loaded up his pushcart and headed for the @entity25 of @entity26 in 1908			1
i was ordering smoked butterfish and nova , sliced thinner than angel wings , as the guys behind the counter plied me with samples of apricot strudel and raspberry rugelach			2
it was spring , my baby was healthy , @entity18 had just put out their marble nut halvah , and all was right with the world			2
i was experiencing what the late , great @entity38 used to call " a perfect moment			2
" please note , mr. @entity38 did n't talk about perfect days , he did n't even refer to a perfect half - hour stretch			2
nope , he only suggested that there are moments when life is inexorably sweet , but those moments are few and far between -- and generally over before you can capture them on the teeny camera in your ridiculously tricked - out cell phone			2
the adorable grandma to my left decided to strike up a conversation : " so , how long have you been coming here , dear ? " she smelled like @entity54 and cinnamon , and i liked her immediately			2
" well , ma'am , my aunt @entity57 first brought me here when i was just a kid , " i answered between bites			2
she smiled warmly and told me she grew up right around the corner , on @entity59 , and had shopped here since the 1920s			2
" i raised five children on this food , " she said , pointing to the baked blueberry farmer 's cheese			1
we were soulmates in sable , partners in pickled herring ; we spoke the language of lox			2
and that 's when it happened			1
my new buddy suddenly reached out her bony little liver - spotted hand , patted my baby - free middle , and asked the one question nobody should ever ask : " when are you due ? " i toyed with the possibility that she had some sort of death wish			2
perhaps the question was actually a thinly veiled plea			0
i mean , is n't it plausible that what she was really saying was " i want to go out on a high note , so i 'll just have a taste of chopped liver , and then do something so heinous that it drives this perfectly reasonable woman to club me to death with a side of salmon " ? @entity0 : how to survive a verbal ambush questions never to ask you see , there are certain questions that must never be asked : 1			1
has your surprise party happened yet ? 2			0
how did you first learn that your husband is cheating ? and , above all : 3			1
when are you due ? i do n't care if the woman you 're asking is wearing a t - shirt with a giant rhinestone - encrusted arrow that points to her belly and reads @entity112			1
i do n't care if she 's writhing on a gurney in the birthing room of @entity118 , screaming for an epidural as an obstetrician announces , " one more push and the baby will be out ! " you never , let me repeat , never , ever , under any circumstances , ask a woman when she 's due			1
" june , " i replied			0
some people collect coins , some prowl the internet for vintage guitars ; i know a woman with a closet full of antique kewpie - doll heads			1
i 'm not totally clear what turned her against everything from the neck down -- she may have been frightened by a @entity136 breast as a child			0
but i 'm nobody to judge , because i , too , am a collector			0
what i collect are slights , digs , withering remarks , and the occasional mean - girl glare			1
i examine a good when - are - you - due story from every angle , i trade them with friends , i commit them to memory , i savor them for eternity			0
insults that live forever here are a few of my favorite insults : my old friend @entity155 remembers the first time she had her @entity159 husband 's family over			1
she cooked for three straight days			0
the woman goulashed and paprikashed and put her tomato sauce through a food mill , for @entity164 's sake			1
at the end of the meal , her new mother - in - law took @entity169 's hands in hers , looked her straight in the eye , and said : " i 'm so glad you feel you can practice on us			1
my former roommate @entity174 came home with an @entity176 on her test and proudly handed the paper to her father			0
" interesting , " he said			0
" i always thought you had to be really smart to get this kind of grade			0
my pal @entity185 tells the story of spending an entire evening with a guy she met when they both reached for the same stuffed zucchini blossom at a fancy fundraiser			0
he suggested they get together the very next day for a picnic in @entity195 , and she was delighted to take charge of the fried chicken and potato salad			0
the next day she waited and waited			0
two hours , one drumstick , half a pound of red bliss potatoes , and five weeks of dieting down the drain later , @entity185 picked up the phone : " what happened ? " his reply : " well , i honked ... but you did n't come out			0
i bring @entity209 to the pediatrician for her annual checkup			0
" would you say she 's unusually tall ? " i ask , hoping that she 'll someday be able to reach all the stuff her 5 ' 2 " mother can not			1
" no , she 's average , " he replies , quick and to the point			1
" are you sure ? " i persist			0
" my friends all tell me that she 's really quite tall			1
" the good doctor peers down his bifocals			0
" maybe your friends do n't want to tell you that she 's really quite average			1
forget about kids ; grown - ups say the darnedest things			0
sometimes they mean well , sometimes they mean to lacerate , sometimes they 're just clueless			0
the challenge ( at least for me ) is not to take any of it personally ... even when it 's meant personally			1
sticks and stones may break my bones , but words will never hurt me , unless of course i decide to let them			0
but it 's a brand new year , and i 've resolved to make a few changes			1
i do n't want to lock and load when a nasty comment comes my way , but i also refuse to duck and cover			0
instead , i am going to answer clumsiness with equanimity , bitchiness with compassion , and verbal violence with disengagement			0
i think it 's a damn good plan -- wise , tolerant , even kind of @entity256			1
if i play my cards right , i could be crowned miss @entity258 2009 ! there 's just one teeny , tiny problem : i honestly believe @entity263 's next - door neighbor stands a better chance of getting a good night 's sleep without ear plugs and an @entity267 than i stand of actually getting this plan to work			1
but that certainly does n't mean it 's not worth a try			1
so i will seek , to paraphrase @entity272 , not to be understood but to understand			0
i will send my collection of slights to @entity275 's and have them auction it off to the highest bidder , one dig at a time , and if none of my attempts at happiness and harmony pays off , well then , i 'm heading for halvah at @entity18			1
