@entity0 , @entity1 -- the framed photos that adorn @entity5 's expansive office are a who 's who of @entity1 's leadership			1
in one president @entity8 is shaking her hand , while premier @entity10 smiles next to her in another			1
but she looked most relaxed and radiant in a photo taken with vice president @entity12 , seen in @entity1 as @entity8 's heir apparent and currently visiting @entity14			1
" i feel very comfortable talking to him , " said the president of the @entity16 , a high - tech firm based in the southeastern city of @entity0			2
" he 's very kind			0
" it was @entity12 's help some 20 years ago that first turned @entity23 's vision into reality			1
in 1993 , when @entity23 and her partners were struggling with red tape to set up a software startup , she went to see @entity12 , then the city 's @entity30 chief			2
" he was far - sighted and realized that @entity1 's economic development would have no solid foundation without its own enterprises or innovation , " @entity23 recalled			1
" he gave us his full backing			0
" firm tone , diplomacy in @entity41 - @entity12 meeting when @entity12 later became the governor of @entity43 -- @entity0 is the provincial capital -- @entity23 said he continued to support @entity44 , visiting the company numerous times , as it grew from a one - desk operation to a mini-empire that employs hundreds of engineers and scientists across the country			1
in a shiny showroom , @entity23 proudly pointed to examples of the latest technology developed by @entity44 , whose portfolio now covers software design , digital television and green technology -- all areas championed by @entity12 " i 'm a businesswoman and he 's a high - ranking official			2
i should 've felt the status gap between us but i never did , " she said			0
" he was such a good listener , paying attention to our ideas and nurturing young entrepreneurs like us			0
" @entity23 's ascent coincided that of @entity12 , who rose through the ranks during his 17 years in @entity43			1
as a politician @entity12 spent more time in this coastal province than any other places -- and analysts say his policy focus and governing style here may offer some clues to deciphering a largely enigmatic figure			2
son of a @entity80 - era revolutionary hero and a pro-economic reform statesman , @entity12 is one of the so - called " princelings " -- children of top communist leaders			2
the 58 - year - old vice president has kept his head down and worked the system , spending most of his post-university years in the provinces before returning to @entity89 in 2007			2
for a long time , the best - known aspect of @entity12 's life was his wife , a famous folk singer who used to perform before millions on state television			1
" we do n't know much about him			0
we do n't know what he really thinks , " said @entity96 , former chief executive of @entity97 in @entity1 and a long - time observer of @entity1 politics			1
" but one thing you 'll see is he 's going to be tough -- i think he 's going to be tough with a smile on his face			0
" such an assessment echoes that of senior @entity111 officials who , after meetings between vice president @entity108 and @entity12 in @entity1 last summer , described the leader - in - waiting as " tough			1
" but they appreciated @entity12 's emphasis on @entity1 - @entity111 relations as a policy priority and viewed him as someone @entity111 could do business with			1
that @entity12 supported entrepreneurs like @entity23 -- first in @entity43 and later in neighboring @entity120 , the province that boasts @entity1 's most vibrant private sector -- may also be an encouraging sign for those who feel increasingly left behind by @entity1 's economic growth model that seems to favor state - owned conglomerates			1
a welder 's wish two hours ' drive from @entity23 's sprawling corporate campus , economic models and foreign policy seem far removed from the minds of residents in @entity134 , a seaside town where rows of fishing boats in fading paint are moored by the shore and rusty machinery sits idle in shipyards nearby			0
local media has reported that , under @entity12 's leadership in the late 1990s , officials moved more than 16,000 poor fishermen and their families who had lived on boats into government subsidized housing , and found land - based jobs for many of them			1
more than a decade later , however , poverty remains visible throughout @entity134			0
some fishing families still sleep on their boats , while others cram into ramshackle slums on the coast			0
even the lucky ones who live in houses have to brave bitter cold winds blown in through cracks in the brick walls			0
an old woman weaving fishing nets by her doorway said she has never heard of @entity166 neighbor agreed -- the last leader both appeared aware of was former president @entity168 , @entity8 's predecessor who retired a decade ago			1
interrupting the women , a young man nearby indicated he certainly knows who @entity12 is			2
@entity172 does n't remember much about @entity12 's time in @entity43 , but the 32 - year - old unemployed welder has a clear message for the future leader			1
" i want a job , " he said			0
" nobody wants to hire people like me -- high school dropouts in our 30s -- here or in big cities			0
" when the shipbuilding industry was booming , @entity172 said he earned as much as 200 yuan ( us $ 30 ) a day			0
now he can barely afford to buy a bowl of noodles , which costs 3 yuan ( 50 @entity111 cents ) at local restaurants			0
" when the shipbuilders went out of business , we lost our livelihood , " he said			0
the bleak scene in @entity134 -- and many other towns like it -- may not fit nicely into the image depicted by @entity111 politicians of a rising superpower that increasingly poses economic and military threat to the @entity111			0
but analysts say it is part of a @entity1 that @entity12 is going to inherit -- and he and his comrades will have to tackle the myriad of problems , especially the widening income gap in a slowing economy , before mass discontent brewing beneath the surface explodes			2
aware of a poorer and angrier segment of population back home , @entity12 may be ready to talk tough during his meetings with @entity111 officials this week , particularly on the economic and trade front			1
" he 's still talking to an audience in @entity1 , " said @entity96 , the @entity1 observer			2
" that 's the constituency that matters to him , especially in a transition time			0
" back in @entity134 , a small crowd gathered in a barbershop had nothing but praise for their former governor , complete with tales of his visit to a flooded village nearby			0
a poster depicting @entity1 's current top @entity30 leadership -- nine men who effectively rule the country -- was pinned on the wall , with the sixth - ranked @entity12 almost in the middle			1
" he 's going to be the big boss , " one man offered in a hushed voice , pointing to @entity12 from @entity43 to @entity14 , almost everyone seems to know that much -- but the rest remains anyone 's guess .			1

@entity12 , seen in @entity1 president @entity8 's heir apparent , is currently visiting the @entity111
one entrepreneur remembers his support for private enterprise as governor of @entity43
for a long time , the best - known aspect of @entity12 's life was his wife , a famous folk singer
after meetings last year , @entity111 officials viewed him as someone @entity111 can do business with
