role of @entity2 , the precocious boy in a dirty white wolf suit who sails to an island full of fearsome horned monsters and becomes their even more fearsome king , he arrived with one advantage -- and it was n't his first name			0
@entity2 plays @entity2 in the film adaptation of the children 's book " @entity9			1
" " i had memorized all the lines , " the now - 12 - year - old acting novice from @entity17 , @entity18 , told @entity0 earlier this year			1
" i was totally obsessed with the book , like from the age of half a year old to , like , 4			0
so i was really familiar with it			0
" ( ah , the perspective of youth			0
) of course , @entity26 's 1963 kid - lit masterpiece is a picture book containing just 10 sentences			1
but @entity29 clearly has a deep feel for the material			0
" it 's not moralistic or patronizing			1
it 's not ' @entity34 did something bad and had to apologize			1
' it 's about being a kid			1
" @entity39 , the auteur behind " @entity40 " and " being @entity41 , " told @entity0 he initially balked when offered the project more than a decade ago -- by no less than @entity26 himself			1
" i felt it was just so perfect in the form in which it already existed , " said @entity39			0
" i did n't know what more you 'd add to flesh it into a movie , or even why you would want to add to it			0
" he 's reluctant to share too many details , but says his live - action adaptation elaborates on the world of the wild things as well as @entity2 's relationship with his mom ( @entity58 ) and her boyfriend ( @entity59 )			1
@entity39 began shooting in 2006 , but by 2008 the movie was not yet finished and there were reports that @entity63 wanted the whole thing reshot			0
not true , says @entity39 and producer @entity65 , though both admit the production was a long , challenging process -- from finding a naturalistic way to depict the fantasy world ( " i wanted everything to feel like it had really happened , not fabricated with @entity73 , " says @entity39 ) to filming in the remote wilderness of @entity75 to getting emotionally resonant performances from records , the puppet monsters , and the voice cast ( including @entity80 and @entity81 )			0
@entity82 , " we made it really , really hard on ourselves			0
" here are more @entity85 for the week of october 11 : movies " @entity87 " ( out friday )			1
the original 1987 " @entity91 " -- about a seemingly kind man who marries a vulnerable widow and then reveals himself to be a murderous psychopath -- spawned two sequels , launched the career of future " lost " star @entity90 , and then pretty much disappeared			0
now , like a horror - movie baddie you were sure was dead , " @entity87 " is back for more			1
this remake stars " @entity103 's " @entity98 as a teen who returns from military school to find that a suspicious new guy ( @entity101 ) has moved in with his divorced mom ( @entity102 )			1
" @entity101 looks so accessible and sincere and warm , " says @entity104			1
" i guess @entity105 did too			0
" okay , now we 're creeped out			0
" @entity107 " ( out friday )			0
@entity108 goes from family man to the meanest vigilante since @entity111 matching with @entity112 in this action - thriller from director f. @entity114 ( " @entity115 " )			2
tv " @entity119 " season finale ( 8 p.m. , tuesday , @entity118 )			0
what " @entity119 " lacks in substance , it makes up for in style , and its slickly edited season finale is a sizzling nail - biter			2
kitchen newbies will have no trouble following along as the three remaining chefs -- egotistical @entity129 , coolheaded @entity130 , and " one - armed bandit " @entity132 -- battle for @entity135 's foulmouthed approval			1
" @entity136 " ( 6 p.m. , tuesday , @entity137 )			0
@entity138 and @entity139 compete tonight , marking the first time a gay couple has ever been on the game show			0
" @entity143 " ( 9:30 p.m. , thursday , @entity144 )			1
" @entity143 " is back ? we want to go to there			1
@entity144 execs and @entity148 , however , might not be so eager to visit , as @entity149 kicks off season 4 with a barbed broadside against network programmers : when @entity155 ( @entity156 ) forces @entity157 ( @entity149 ) to add a mainstream - friendly cast member to broaden her show 's audience , @entity154 's @entity153 sweats his appeal to the common man , while @entity163 ( @entity164 ) gives herself a heartland - pandering country makeover			1
the satire on play - it - safe execs is wickedly droll			1
also make sure to stay till the end to see @entity149 and @entity156 give a bitchy , meta " welcome " to their lead - out , @entity148 , whom @entity149 already jabbed at the @entity172 by thanking @entity144 for keeping " @entity143 " on even though it 's " more expensive than a talk show			1
" music " @entity176 , " @entity101 ( out tuesday )			1
what 's that blowin ' in the winter wind ? sounds like holiday cheer			2
profits go to the hunger - relief charity @entity182			2
" @entity183 , " @entity184 ( out tuesday )			0
@entity187 , no doubt , to the success of his adult - contemporary smash " home , " the @entity186 crooner makes a few too many soft - rock concessions on his new studio disc			2
covering the @entity194 , as @entity184 does with a hokey version of " @entity196 , " seems way beneath a singer with his level of style			0
still , there 's no denying the sexy - jerk swagger @entity184 brings to " @entity203 , " which here sounds like a @entity207 - movie theme , or to " @entity208 ) , " a funky duet with @entity211 soul sister @entity210			1
" @entity212 : the music of @entity214 , " @entity214 box set ( out tuesday )			2
collecting the best of the blue - eyed soul smoothies , and making fans ' dreams come true			2
@entity0 recently asked @entity214 to fill us in on his personal favorites ; for the record : " she 's gone , " " @entity224 , " " @entity225 , " " @entity226 , " and " @entity227			1
" dvd " @entity229 " ( out tuesday )			0
yes , it 's a rip - off of 1990 's " @entity231			1
" and sure , you can see every plot twist driving down @entity234			0
so the fact that " the proposal " winds up as breezy and entertaining as it does qualifies as some sort of @entity240 miracle			0
@entity243 plays an icy book editor about to get deported back to @entity245 unless she can find an @entity247 husband , stat. @entity241 is her long - suffering assistant , who conveniently happens to be single			2
as the groom 's dirty - bird grandma , @entity249 is a hoot -- and frankly , the ho - hum extras ( director 's commentary , lame outtakes ) could 've used more of her			1
" @entity256 " ( out tuesday )			0
welcome back , @entity257 ! the @entity258 director returns to his delirious " @entity260 " roots for " @entity256 , " a kick - ass ghost story about a bank officer ( @entity262 ) who denies a loan to the wrong gypsy woman			1
there are curses , maggots and -- thanks to this unrated version -- lots more gore and goo			0
extras include a fantastic production diary			0
books " @entity276 , " @entity275 ( out tuesday )			0
@entity275 writes fast - paced best - sellers that critics praise for their sharp characterizations and fluid storytelling			2
the appearance of a third @entity283 title in a year would be excellent news if " @entity276 , " his latest offering , did n't read like it had been scribbled during a red - eye from @entity286 to @entity287 , the two cities where the slapdash action unfolds			2
" @entity291 , " @entity292 ( out tuesday )			0
@entity292 's latest novel follows the blank , descriptively named former teen actor @entity294 as he floats , increasingly disoriented and adrift , between two @entity296 worlds : one glamorous and social , the other bohemian and intellectual			2
thick with paranoia , pot smoke and pop culture references ( both real and made - up ) , " @entity291 " is a feverish portrait of the anxiety and isolation of modern @entity303 , full of dark humor and dazzling writing			2
the book 's zonked philosophizing about the nature of reality wears a little thin , but @entity292 's claustrophobic vision of a world where everything is connected and nothing is as it seems proves both funny and frightening			2
