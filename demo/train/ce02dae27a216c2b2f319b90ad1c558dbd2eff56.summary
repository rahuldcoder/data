@entity0 , @entity1 -- in many ways , it seems like time has given @entity0 a wide berth			1
the @entity8 island , perched placidly off @entity1 's coast , is home to one of the oldest continuously inhabited @entity13 towns -- an ethnic group in @entity8 who have lived here for more than 700 years			1
there are no cars on the island -- the streets are too narrow and winding			1
instead , locals rely on donkeys for transport on the land , and dhows to travel throughout the archipelago			1
now a @entity26 , @entity0 was once the most important international trade center in @entity8 -- as is evidenced by the @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity32 influences in the local architecture			1
the most @entity13 feature , however , is the use of coral stone , which reigns supreme throughout the island			1
not only is coral stone strong , it 's a few degrees cooler than cement , making it an ideal building resource in a region known for its sweltering heat			2
in fact , coral stone has a long history in the construction of @entity0 , as is evidenced by the @entity46 ruins -- the remains of what was once a thriving trading town			1
in the 16th and 17th centuries , @entity46 attracted merchants from across the globe			0
" the @entity28 were here , the @entity29 were here , the @entity55 , " says local historian @entity53			0
" the @entity13 people used to trade with a lot of foreign people			2
" much like @entity0 's more modern buildings , the relics of this ancient commercial hub are mainly made from coral stone and lime -- though foreign influences abound			2
" the @entity29 introduced arches and balconies , " notes @entity53			0
foreigners -- lured by the charming architecture and relaxed way of life -- continue to flock to @entity0 , with many buying and renovating the old @entity13 mansions , or simply building new ones			1
as a result , locals often find themselves outbid when buying property			2
local artisan @entity78 , for instance , recalls the difficulty he had in procuring his dream house			0
" i was so in love with this house			0
i put in an offer and people from @entity32 put their offer			0
i put in another offer , they put in another offer , and somehow i got it			0
it was very expensive for me , " he says			0
he hopes to preserve the past with the building , especially as he sees more foreigners investing in @entity0 's future , a new twist on its historic role as a hub for international trade			2
