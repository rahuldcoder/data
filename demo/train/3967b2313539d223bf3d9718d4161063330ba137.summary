-- february 9 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : how can you trust what you read online ? we 've got some of your answers coming up in this wednesday edition of @entity0			2
bringing you today 's headlines , i 'm @entity24			1
first up : @entity25 @entity26 @entity27 : our first stop today : the @entity4 , for talks between the @entity30			1
representatives from the two countries are back at it today after a full day of talks yesterday			1
this is the first time in eight months that @entity36 have had direct contact with each other			2
the silence started after the @entity40 blamed the @entity30 for two military attacks last year			2
these talks are happening at a truce village			1
the representatives did n't come to any conclusions yesterday , but they said there were n't any political arguments from either side			2
the goal of these meetings is to set up another round of talks between officials who are higher up in their countries ' governments			1
@entity25 says it 'll only agree to those if @entity57 promises not to provoke the @entity40 any more			2
@entity58 @entity27 : next up , @entity5 , where officials are promising one million dollars to a fund for wildfire victims			2
we 've talked recently about floods and a cyclone in eastern @entity5			2
these fires were in western @entity5 , on the other side of the country			2
the flames burned more than a thousand acres of land and damaged or destroyed more than 60 buildings			2
anyone who lost their home will immediately get $ 3,000 from the government			2
@entity75 of @entity5 's @entity76 was on hand as residents returned home to see the damage			1
she checks in now with some of the victims ' reactions and an explanation of how these fires started			2
@entity75 ? ( begin video ) @entity86 , @entity76 reporter : it 's absolutely heartbreaking to see what people are going through here			1
there 's just so many stories , and each one of them really touches your heart			1
a short time ago , a man returned to the home here behind me where he saw what was left of his house for the first time			2
it was obviously incredibly emotional			2
but what really struck me was as he was leaving , he walked away and shrugged his shoulders and said , " oh well , you know , i 'll just rebuild			2
" i think that really shows the real @entity5 spirit there			2
another example : i spoke to a couple earlier today that had tears pouring down their faces as they spoke about what they lost			1
but all they wanted to do was to thank the firefighters for their efforts for putting their lives on the line as they tried to save their home			2
so , i think that 's just amazing			1
what 's actually believed to have happened is it was sparked by a power tool			1
on sunday , conditions here were just hot and windy			0
and as a result , we had what 's called a total fire ban , which means people are n't allowed to use power tools			1
what 's actually believed to have happened is a resident was using a power tool			1
he 's actually a police officer			1
and that is what started the fire			0
as a result , he now faces possible criminal charges over this			0
it 's a very serious matter , and the arson squad is now investigating			1
( @entity147 ) what 's the @entity149 ? @entity150 , @entity15 : what 's the @entity149 ? it 's the name for the process by which a bank takes back a home because the owner ca n't make payments @entity158 that 's the word ! @entity160 @entity27 : so in a foreclosure , the homeowner loses the house			1
and when you get a lot of foreclosures in one area , it can bring down the value of all the houses nearby			0
the mayor of @entity6 has an idea to fill up some of the foreclosed homes in his city : sell them to police officers and firefighters ! the mayor 's proposal is to offer police and firefighters the chance to buy foreclosed homes for as little as $ 1,000 dollars			1
plus , they could get money to do some renovations			0
this would be paid for by private investors and with government money that 's supposed to help redevelop the city			1
the mayor says the idea could help more than just the housing market			0
@entity194 @entity193 , @entity6 , @entity7 : police officers living in their neighborhoods have the potential to deter crime , increase public safety , and improve relations between the community and our sworn officers			1
testing toyotas @entity27 : the @entity206 @entity205 has spent 10 months investigating why some @entity208 vehicles sped up for no apparent reason			0
in 2008 and 2009 , we reported on when the car company recalled millions of cars because of this problem			0
some critics thought it might have been caused by the vehicles ' electronic throttle systems			0
but according to the testing , that 's not the case			1
the government says , so far , the only known causes of the problem are sticky pedals and floor mats that got in the way of the pedals			0
officials say it 's also possible that drivers may have gotten confused and pushed the gas instead of the brake			1
@entity208 is facing hundreds of lawsuits related to this issue			0
@entity235 @entity236 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity239 's world geography class at @entity240 in @entity241 , @entity242 ! the words algebra , hazard and mummy all come from what language ? you know what to do here ! is it : a ) @entity251 , @entity250 or @entity252 ) @entity253 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! all of these words can be traced back to the arabic language			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity260 ? @entity27 : at my high school , we could choose to take @entity264 , @entity265 or @entity266			1
we had to take a language , but we got to pick which one			0
at some schools in @entity271 , a plan was being considered to require students to take @entity273			1
the school district got a grant from the @entity206 @entity276 that would make @entity273 classes mandatory at some schools			1
the plan is now being reconsidered , but as @entity281 of affiliate @entity283 reports , the original idea still angered some parents			1
( begin video ) @entity286 , reporter , @entity283 : all over the room , there were questions			0
@entity291 , parent : why are we just now finding out about it ? @entity295 : dozens of concerned parents showed up at @entity298 to speak with @entity300 superintendent dr. @entity299			0
the district was awarded a federal grant last summer to teach the arabic language			1
@entity304 , parent : the school does not teach @entity307 , so i do n't want them teaching the @entity309			1
@entity295 : the district stressed the curriculum would not be about religion , but about the language and culture , similar to the @entity265 curriculum already in place			1
but upset parents say they should have been informed months ago about the grant			0
@entity291 : it 's them applying for the grant and getting it approved , and now saying they 're going to be able to go back and change it , only after they were caught trying to implement this plan without any of the parents knowing about it			1
@entity295 : the grant , known as the @entity330 , has identified @entity273 as a language of the future			1
some parents say teaching it in the @entity300 is a good idea			0
@entity336 , parent : i think it 's a great opportunity			1
i think it , you know , not only opens doors and we ... i think globally , act locally			0
@entity295 : @entity343 was born in @entity344 but raised in the @entity206 she says the option to learn @entity273 will give her son a chance to know more about his culture and hopefully broaden the minds of not only students , but also parents			1
@entity352 , parent : it was surprising , but i think it 's ok			1
and i think it would be fine , because that way you 'll cut down on the stereotype			0
( @entity147 ) blog report @entity27 : take your opinion on this to the web			0
our blog is at @entity367			0
our @entity369 site is @entity369 / @entity370			0
here we go now with your responses to the " tree octopus " experiment : how do you know that what you see online is the truth ? @entity377 suggests " you should check and see who the author or publisher of the article is			0
you should also check other web sites to see if they have similar results			0
" @entity385 agrees " you definitely have to check your sources , " something we hear in journalism an awful lot			0
" if you get the wrong info , you can be in trouble			0
validate your source ; you 'll be happy that you did			0
" and the first thing @entity395 's teacher says to do is to check at least five web sites to see if the info is used more than once			1
if so , it 's more than 80 percent true			1
" i think it is in teachers ' best interest that they work on finding reliable sources for the students			1
not to do the work for them , but to make sure they know how to find a source			0
@entity413 at @entity369 / @entity370 says to check the publisher or to ask the teacher if the web site has accurate info			0
" if you write a paper for a class , you would n't want inaccurate information			0
" and @entity422 says simply : " people need to stop believing everything they read on the internet			0
" before we go @entity27 : well , before we go , coaches usually give their time to players			0
but this one gave a lot more than that			0
coach @entity433 gave @entity434 a kidney ! he recruited @entity434 to play on the @entity437 baseball team			0
when @entity434 got sick and needed a kidney transplant , turned out his coach was a match ! the transplant surgery was done earlier this week , and doctors say @entity434 could be back on the field by the 2012 season			0
goodbye @entity27 : an awesome story and our best wishes to @entity434 and his coach			0
since we 're not making any puns today , we 'll leave you with this thought from @entity452 on our @entity369 page			2
" if you 're writing with a broken pencil , it 's pointless			2
" send us your sign - off lines at @entity369 / @entity370			0
they do n't need to be puns ! we 'd be happy to read them on the air			0
have a great day , everyone .			0
