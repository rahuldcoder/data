@entity0 , @entity1 -- last weekend 's 143 million - pound beef recall -- the largest in @entity5 history -- was initiated not simply because cattle that could n't walk made it into the @entity5 food supply , but because they were n't reinspected after becoming immobile			1
since 2004 , the @entity5 @entity10 has required that cattle be able to walk to slaughter after an inspection by a @entity10 veterinarian -- largely as a precaution against bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or mad cow disease			1
if the animal goes down after a veterinarian 's pre-death inspection , which consists of observing the animals " at rest and in motion , " veterinarians must reinspect the animal before it can enter the food supply , according to a @entity10 spokesman			1
this rule was put in place when the first cow with mad cow disease was found in @entity31 at the end of 2003			1
the symptoms of mad cow disease are n't always the obvious stumbling or odd posture seen in video of mad cows from @entity39 over a decade ago			1
the @entity10 says they also include changes in temperament , like nervousness or aggression , and decreased milk production			2
cattle that ca n't walk to slaughter on their own are deemed " downer cows " because they may be sick			1
@entity5 agriculture secretary @entity49 said sunday in a statement that the recall was prompted " because the cattle did not receive complete and proper inspection " and were determined to be " unfit for human food			2
" only rarely does a cow pass pre-slaughter inspection , somehow become unable to walk , and then get re-examined by a veterinarian and pass for slaughter , according to dr. @entity59 of the @entity10			1
he says a likely explanation for such situations is an animal falling and injuring itself to the point where it ca n't walk			0
the animal could break a leg because " it stepped onto a broken concrete floor or runs into a fence post , " he suggested			0
that " would n't be an illness , " added @entity68 , the @entity10 's executive associate for regulatory operations , office of field operations for the @entity71			2
last year , the @entity10 decided to make permanent an exception to the " no downer cattle should enter the food - supply rule " by allowing a downed cow to go to slaughter if it had already passed pre-slaughter inspection and then passed another inspection after it lost its ability to walk			1
" we proposed this to the public , got the comments , and this led to the final decision that the animals be evaluated on a case - by - case basis and could pass for slaughter , " @entity59 tells @entity2			0
however , some strongly disagree with this decision , including dr. @entity93 , a former @entity10 veterinarian who trained other veterinarians to detect mad cow disease			1
she says the @entity10 should not make any exceptions to the downer cow rule			1
in making her case , she submitted several public comments that said that in the two cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy reported by the @entity10 , neither was set aside as a @entity103 suspect			2
" the @entity31 case [ in 2003 ] was passed for human consumption because she was determined to have a calving injury , " @entity93 said			0
a @entity108 cow , also in 2003 , was condemned because it had pneumonia			0
@entity103 was discovered in the cow only after it was rendered and its meat and bone meal distributed			0
@entity93 expressed concern about the @entity10 's chances of finding the disease before slaughter			1
based on a @entity119 risk assessment , agency inspectors expect to catch 95 percent of @entity103 cases in cattle that can walk , and 85 percent in cattle that ca n't			2
but in the @entity124 , where the overwhelming number of @entity103 cases have been seen , veterinarians say they 've been able to detect only half of @entity103 cases in pre-slaughter inspections			0
@entity59 insists that few animals go down after pre-slaughter examination			0
he says , " my veterinarian makes that determination " if a downer animal can go on to slaughter -- " they are under no pressure " to let the animals pass inspection because " the vets are n't interested in the plant 's disposition			0
" but @entity93 says it 's not possible to see the underlying neurological illnesses that could lead cattle to stumble , fall and break a leg			0
" if i know the animal 's history , then i can probably tell you what it went down with , " she says			0
" but if i see it for the first time , [ as the @entity10 inspectors probably would ] , when it 's down ... you do n't know the underlying cause			0
" so far , 200 people worldwide have become infected with mad cow disease from eating beef from an infected cow			1
it can take many years for symptoms to appear			0
in the @entity5 , the first of three documented cases of variant @entity166 , the human form of mad cow disease , was a young woman named @entity168			1
she got sick 13 years after living in @entity39 , where she probably consumed tainted beef at the height of the mad cow scare			1
the @entity176 plant at the center of the current controversy , @entity174 / @entity173 , is now shut down , and the @entity180 district attorney has filed charges against two employees			0
@entity183 , @entity184 , was taken into custody and has posted bail			0
the other , @entity187 , remains at large			0
the plant can no longer operate because the @entity10 withdrew its inspectors after the @entity190 provided video of animal abuse at the plant and the @entity10 learned that some animals , so - called " downer cows , " were slaughtered without reinspection			2
without @entity10 inspectors on site , the plant is not allowed to operate			2
the @entity10 says that the food supply is safe and that only two cows in the @entity5 have been found to have @entity103			1
officials credit the low number to @entity71 regulations prohibiting downer cattle from entering the food supply			1
of the 143 million pounds of recalled beef produced by the @entity206 , 37 million pounds were provided to the federal food and nutrition programs			0
consumers wondering whether they consumed some of the meat probably do n't know because the @entity10 does n't release the names of retailers who sold recalled meat , something the nonprofit @entity215 has been pushing for since the first mad cow scare in 2003			1
the @entity10 tells @entity2 that changing this rule is a priority for dr. @entity219 , undersecretary for food safety , and " we expect that the rule will be published and implemented this year			2
" e-mail to a friend @entity224 is a managing editor of @entity225 .			0

@entity10 : cattle must be able to walk to slaughter ; reinspection required for " downers "
rule was instituted to *protect* food supply from threat of mad cow disease
*critics* say no downer cattle should be allowed into food supply
