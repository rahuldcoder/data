@entity0 -- @entity2 announced tuesday the new retirement homes for the four remaining space shuttles -- three historic orbiters and the program 's test vehicle			1
the space shuttle @entity8 will be displayed at the @entity9 in @entity10 ; the @entity11 , at the @entity12 in @entity0 ; the @entity13 , at the @entity14 's @entity16 @entity15 in @entity17 ; and the test shuttle , @entity20 , at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity2 administrator @entity18 said during a ceremony at the @entity24			1
the announcement was made on the 30th anniversary of the space shuttle program 's first flight , made by the subsequently ill - fated @entity30 orbiter , and the 50th anniversary of @entity33 cosmonaut @entity32 becoming the first human in space			1
more than 20 locations around the country sought one of the orbiters because of the potential tourist draw			1
the drama mirrored the bidding to host an @entity43			2
supporters of sites that were rejected expressed disappointment			2
@entity49 sen. @entity48 , @entity50 , said the @entity51 in @entity52 should have been one of the retirement homes for an orbiter , " but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet , " he said in a statement			0
he noted that @entity52 " played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle			1
" " like many @entity67 , i am disappointed with @entity2 's decision to slight the @entity51 as a permanent home for one of the space shuttle orbiters , " @entity48 said			1
" there is no question @entity52 should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters -- even administrator @entity77 stated as much			0
today 's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at @entity51 , the greater @entity52 community and the state of @entity83 , and i 'm deeply disappointed with the administration 's misguided decision , " @entity48 said			0
in @entity0 , shortly after @entity2 's announcement , @entity12 president @entity86 told reporters that the @entity11 would boost the center 's annual 1.4 million visitors to about 2 million people a year			1
the center plans to use the orbiter as the centerpiece to a new air and space gallery , which would cost $ 200 million and is part of the center 's 25 - year master plan , @entity86 said			1
that price tag includes the $ 28.8 million that the center must pay @entity2 to prepare and relocate the orbiter to @entity0 , he said			0
the center has n't hired an architect yet to design the new facility and is now planning a fundraiser , he said			0
" obviously , we were thrilled			0
we got the word this morning , shortly before the announcement , " @entity86 said of his reaction to winning one of the shuttles			1
" the fact that the shuttle was created here in @entity115 had a lot to do with giving us a leg up " over the competition , @entity86 said			1
" it 's a fitting place for this national treasure			0
" the center , which also features a @entity0 charter school , is the most attended museum in southern @entity115 and one of the most attended in the country , @entity86 said			0
the @entity0 center 's existing air and space gallery is now home to the @entity132 capsule that carried @entity133 , a chimpanzee , on a suborbital flight , and the @entity137 capsule flown by astronauts @entity138 and @entity140 on an orbital flight			1
@entity49 sen. @entity142 said she and sen. @entity143 -- both @entity115 @entity144 -- wrote to @entity2 's @entity77 last year asking that @entity115 become home to one of the shuttles because the state has a long history with the shuttle program			1
beginning in 1972 , all five space shuttle orbiters were fabricated in @entity152 , @entity115 , and assembled in @entity153 , @entity115 , @entity142 said in a statement			1
all of the space shuttles were tested at @entity156 just outside of @entity153 , where 53 of @entity2 's 133 shuttle missions landed , she said			1
the @entity11 will take its final flight on april 29 , and prior to this launch , it will have been used on 24 missions , orbited the earth 4,429 times and traveled 103,149,636 miles , @entity142 said			1
" @entity115 has a long history of supporting the shuttle program and we are proud to welcome this inspiring symbol of @entity49 scientific achievement and ingenuity to the @entity171 , " @entity142 said in a statement			1
audience members at the @entity9 cheered when @entity77 announced the @entity8 would be assigned to that launch facility			1
many people in the gallery were center workers , some of whom are likely to lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends			1
because the announcement was being made at @entity182 , expectations were high that the visitor center would be awarded one of the shuttles			2
the @entity186 in @entity187 also wanted one			0
in fact , one wall of a new space gallery where a shuttle would be housed was already erected in anticipation			1
prior to tuesday 's announcement , the museum 's president , @entity194 , said museum officials did n't have any inside information			0
" i think that confident may be too strong a word			0
i think that hopeful is probably a better one , " he said			0
but on tuesday , @entity203 gov. @entity202 also said he was disappointed that the @entity2 did n't select the @entity187 museum for one of the retired shuttles			2
" @entity186 put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the @entity210			2
as the home of modern day air travel and the 747 , which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years , @entity187 would have been a perfect fit , " @entity202 said in a statement			2
" however , the full fuselage trainer , that every astronaut including @entity218 has been trained on , will soon call the @entity186 home , " the governor said			0
" the largest of the trainers , this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands - on training that astronauts get			0
visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum			2
" @entity235 in @entity236 , @entity22 , @entity237 , @entity238 , and @entity239 , @entity240 , also put in requests for an orbiter , with hopes that such a historic artifact would inspire countless children in those areas to explore careers in science and engineering			2
becoming home to an orbiter promises to be a boon for a community			0
the @entity9 estimates a shuttle will bring in 200,000 more guests every year			2
the economic impact to the area is estimated at about $ 15 million			2
at @entity22 's @entity21 , executive director @entity258 told @entity1 , " figure over 300,000 people additional ( due ) to the @entity21 , to @entity22			0
couple that with $ 106 million in economic benefit			2
we think that 's a pretty good deal			0
" each winning location has to fork over $ 28.8 million to @entity2 for delivery of the vehicles			0
they also must guarantee a climate - controlled building will be constructed to house their shuttle			2
that 's still a bargain , officials at the bidding locations said , because of the return on investment they expect			0
one of the orbiters -- @entity13 , the oldest -- was largely regarded as being @entity14 - bound			1
that was confirmed by tuesday 's announcement			0
the @entity20 , a test shuttle that never flew in space , is there now			1
it was be reassigned , at a discounted price , to one of the locations that did n't get either @entity11 or @entity8			1
that location turned out to be the @entity21 in @entity22			0
only two more shuttle flights are scheduled : @entity11 on april 29 and @entity8 on june 28 , wrapping up a program in which the vehicles launched satellites , built a space station , and launched and repaired an orbiting telescope			1
after that , they become museum pieces			0
two other shuttles were destroyed in flight accidents			1
the @entity299 exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on january 28 , 1986 , and the @entity30 disintegrated during re-entry on february 1 , 2003			0
@entity1 's @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity304 contributed to this report .			0

the shuttles @entity13 , @entity11 and @entity8 carry historic and economic value
the fourth , the @entity20 , was a test shuttle that never flew into space
communities housing the shuttles are expected to enjoy a tourist boom
april 12 is the 50th anniversary of the first human space flight and 30th of the first shuttle flight
