trust us , we 're from @entity1			0
@entity4 's largest @entity3 companies are tripping over themselves to bolster their public image following blockbuster disclosures about their role in the @entity4 government 's controversial data - gathering program			1
ever since news reports suggested that major tech firms — including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 — provide the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) with unfettered or " direct " access to their servers , the companies have been waging an aggressive campaign to demonstrate that they 're not government stooges			1
now , several of the top @entity1 firms are engaged in a game of one - upmanship to show that they are the most transparent internet company on the block			0
the initial reports about " direct access , " as part of a classified @entity4 intelligence system called @entity32 , have turned out to be wrong			2
but the @entity32 reports have highlighted long - standing privacy fears about how the largest @entity4 tech companies handle their vast troves of user data			1
the internet giants have come under scrutiny following reports that the @entity17 uses @entity32 to examine data — including e-mails , videos and online chats — that it collects via requests made under the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , one of the controversial laws at the heart of the current @entity17 - snooping furor			1
following the @entity32 leak , which was supplied to the @entity53 and the @entity54 by whistle - blower @entity55 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 all issued statements — in strikingly similar legal language — denying that they give the @entity17 " direct " or unfettered access to their computer servers			1
but the companies apparently felt the need to go further than those denials , and in recent days have engaged in a competition to demonstrate their commitment to transparency			0
although @entity1 has roots in the @entity4 military — the @entity67 was central to the development of the @entity3 — today 's big tech companies are keen to demonstrate their independence from the government and often display a libertarian streak			1
many engineers in @entity1 are sympathetic to " hacker " culture			0
above all , @entity1 tech titans are wary of losing the trust of consumers , which could endanger their businesses			0
these companies are no doubt well aware of the numerous more secure alternatives to their services , some of which enable users to roam the internet anonymously			0
@entity14 kicked off the transparency battle last week when it asked @entity4 attorney general @entity90 and fbi director @entity91 for permission to publish " aggregate numbers of national - security requests , including @entity46 disclosures — in terms of both the number we receive and their scope			1
" that request was noteworthy because it was the first time @entity14 had even acknowledged that it receives national - security @entity46 requests			1
@entity15 and @entity103 quickly followed suit with similar requests			2
a @entity107 spokesperson told @entity108 that the agency is in the process of reviewing the request			0
then , over the weekend , @entity15 , which unlike @entity14 has never published a transparency report , reached an agreement with the government allowing it to disclose data on @entity4 information requests			1
@entity15 said that for the six months ending dec. 31 , 2012 , it received between 9,000 and 10,000 data requests , including criminal and national - security - related requests , covering between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts			1
" we 're pleased that as a result of our discussions , we can now include in a transparency report all @entity4 national - security - related requests ( including @entity46 as well as @entity128 ) — which until now no company has been permitted to do , " @entity15 general counsel @entity123 said in a not - so - subtle dig at the company 's rivals			1
shortly thereafter , @entity103 released similar data , indicating that the company received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national - security requests affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 consumer accounts			1
" this only impacts a tiny fraction of @entity103 's global customer base , " @entity135 , @entity103 's deputy general counsel , said in a blog post			0
" transparency alone may not be enough to restore public confidence , but it 's a great place to start			0
" on monday , @entity13 joined the party and announced that from dec. 1 , 2012 , to may 31 , 2013 , it received between 4,000 and 5,000 requests from @entity4 law enforcement for customer data related to between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices , including both criminal investigations and national - security " matters			1
" @entity13 said it was releasing the data " in the interest of transparency			2
" @entity16 followed late monday , saying it received " between 12,000 and 13,000 requests , inclusive of criminal , @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , and other requests			0
" here 's the problem			0
according to the agreement @entity15 , @entity103 , @entity13 and @entity16 reached with the government , the companies were only permitted to release aggregate numbers of total @entity4 data requests			1
crucially , they were not permitted to separately break out the number of @entity46 requests			0
for this reason , we do n't know if they received 50 @entity46 requests , 500 or 5,000			0
as a result , the disclosures , while laudable , skirt around the central issue of the @entity17 - snooping controversy , which is the nature and extent of the companies ' participation in secret @entity4 national - security investigations			1
" we believe the companies should be allowed to break out specific numbers for @entity46 requests , " said @entity181 , director of the @entity182 at the @entity183 , a @entity184 - based public - interest organization			1
" these numbers would provide nationwide transparency			0
we also believe that individual users targeted under @entity46 should receive notice that they were subject to surveillance , even after the fact , so they have the chance to contest the surveillance in court			0
" for @entity14 , which earlier this year was the first internet company to disclose requests made for @entity128 ( @entity198 ) — a separate type of query than @entity46 requests — the arrangement struck by @entity15 , @entity103 , @entity13 and @entity16 was not satisfactory			1
" we have always believed that it 's important to differentiate between different types of government requests , " @entity14 said in a statement			2
" we already publish criminal requests separately from @entity128			0
lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users			0
our request to the government is clear : to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national - security requests , including @entity46 disclosures , separately			1
" @entity215 , which was not named in the @entity17 leak as a participant in the @entity32 , quickly threw its support behind @entity14			1
" we agree with @entity14 , " @entity219 , @entity215 's legal director , said in a @entity215 message			2
" it 's important to be able to publish numbers of national - security requests — including @entity46 disclosures — separately			2
" thus , the contours of the transparency battle were drawn			0
on one side : @entity15 , @entity103 and @entity13			2
on the other , @entity14 and @entity215			0
for their part , @entity15 , @entity103 and @entity16 said they would continue to urge the government to allow them to be more specific about national - security requests , including @entity46 requests			2
@entity15 said it would continue " to push for even more transparency , so that our users around the world can understand how infrequently we are asked to provide user data on national - security grounds			2
" @entity103 said : " what we are permitted to publish continues to fall short of what is needed to help the community understand and debate these issues			0
" but only @entity14 has thus far resisted striking a deal with the government on the disclosure of data requests			1
on monday , a @entity14 spokesperson told @entity108 that the company had no update on its negotiations with the government concerning breaking out @entity46 requests .			2

big @entity3 companies are tripping over themselves to bolster their public image
@entity13 , @entity15 , @entity14 and others deny giving the @entity17 access to their servers
the tech companies have released aggregate numbers of total @entity4 data requests
but the disclosures skirt around the central issue of the @entity17 - snooping controversy
