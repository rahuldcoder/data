one can climb aboard a @entity13 jet in @entity14 and make it to @entity16 , @entity17 , in a bit less than 15 hours for an impromptu business meeting			2
but when it comes to luxury train travel , finding the fastest route between two points is not the goal			1
it is more about settling back in one 's seat and savoring the experience , one station at a time			1
the train trips on this list are diverse , encompassing varied cultures within epic journeys , like a four - week excursion through @entity36 with stops at the pyramids and @entity39 , or a two - week @entity41 sojourn through @entity42 that crosses eight time zones and travels a quarter of the way around the world			1
departures : riding the @entity48 train not all cover thousands of miles			1
micro journeys -- such as a day trip through the thick , green vegetation of @entity53 to climb the steps of @entity55 -- can be just as eye - opening			2
and some trips are about a sense of place , offering a comfortable feeling that you may slip into when , say , sipping whisky aboard a train rolling through the @entity63			1

all aboard : railroad adventures for every budget @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 this 800 - mile trip aboard the @entity72 , through the homeland of @entity76 and @entity77 , is nothing short of romantic			1
the train winds its way through some of southern @entity74 's most iconic medieval cities — @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			1
they are areas where hard - fought religious battles resulted in today 's cultural kaleidoscope , a tightly woven fabric touched by @entity93 and @entity95 influence			1
best of all , traveling from the glittering @entity97 palace in @entity86 to the palm - lined squares and wide streets of @entity100 in an original 1929 @entity102 carriage lends a sense of old - world glamour and history			0

the seven - day , six - night fables of the @entity124 journey zips through the mist - covered @entity125 and past @entity126 , home to one of @entity129 's largest freshwater lakes , with an opportunity to disembark and taste the teas and strawberries grown in the hills			1

departures : @entity109 's most bikeable wine regions @entity173 , @entity174 to @entity55 , @entity53 this is one of the shortest trips on our list — just three and a half hours each way — but it packs a punch			1
those who board the @entity173 receive a warm towel and are asked to sign a leather - bound guest book			0
after brunch , spectacular sights ( like the snowcapped @entity186 ) begin to unfold outside the windows as the train zigzags along switchbacks through the agricultural terraces of the @entity193 city of @entity194			1
then it is on to the cloud - laden @entity196 , thick with green vegetation , before finally arriving at @entity198 , just a bit more than a mile from the famous lost city of @entity55 , with its more than 3,000 steps looming in the distance			0

guests will take in a broad swath of @entity36 , from a visit with chimpanzees in @entity215 to a tour of the pyramids and the @entity231 in @entity216 to the rushing waters of @entity39 in @entity213 — a sight so powerful , explorer @entity234 said the falls must have been " gazed upon by angels in their flight			0

the six - day , five - night excursion , which begins and ends in @entity270 , scales the @entity271 of @entity272 , during which the royal @entity260 climbs 1,070 feet in 10 miles of track along a narrow mountain pass			2
