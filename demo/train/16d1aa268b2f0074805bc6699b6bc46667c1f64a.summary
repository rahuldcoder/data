in the thick of @entity1 's concrete jungle , surrounded by dense residential spaces and a web of roaring highways lies the @entity6 at the @entity7			1
the building , which opened just over a year ago , is the new home for the university 's design students			1
although it is affiliated with the @entity13 , it has nothing to do with horse racing and everything to do with design			0
stretching 15 stories skywards and with interior space measuring up to 15,000 square - meters , the $ 81 million tower consists of labs , workshop spaces , classrooms and exhibition areas that are open to the public			1
it 's a stark contrast to the rest of the old - fashioned red - brick campus			2
displaying fluid corridors , curvaceous walls , and a radical structure , the @entity29 is also the first building from renowned @entity36 - born @entity35 architect @entity34 to be built in @entity1			1
" the school has a long history but it used to be blended into the campus , it was quite sort of hidden , " said @entity37 , an architect at @entity38			2
" now with a new home it brings it all out into one hub			0
" it 's hoped the futuristic design will inspire the next generation of ambitious artists , architects and designers currently studying on the 50 - year - old campus			1
the design " tries to do all that by exposing as much sort of visually as possible , not just the work from the students but of course the building , " @entity37 added			2
for the students , the building is a fresh source of stimulation			0
second year design student , @entity63 , describes the importance of studying and being located in a building that emphasizes all sorts of creative possibilities			0
" when i stepped in this building ... it 's kind of a sense of identity and i feel like i 'm a design student , " she said			0
" the thing you see like the walls and the lights and the shapes of the building actually affects your thinking of design			0
" but beyond an environment that inspires innovation , the school also has diverse global ambitions			0
it has already drawn up to 150,000 visitors since it opened last year			0
it 's not only ( for ) our students and our teachers in the building , " said professor @entity87 , president , @entity7 " constantly we have folks from the business sector , we have folks from the industries , coming here to interact with our students and professors ... our students in fact get exposed to a much wider field of design			1
" bold , ambitious and slanting to the future , this school hopes to shake up @entity1 's design industry and influence the shape of the city in the future as well .			1
