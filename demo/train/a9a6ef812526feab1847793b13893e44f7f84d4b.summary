-- she could be the greatest tweeter in the world ... if only @entity3 would verify her			1
@entity5 -- the " @entity11 " alum , current " @entity7 " star , and laugh - til - you - cry visionary behind @entity10 -- is in the throes of a one - woman campaign ( or , as she likes to call , it " my own l'il @entity15 " ) to get her @entity3 account verified			1
@entity5 joined the service august 10			1
that means she 's been part of the @entity20 during an @entity22 meltdown , a @entity24 scandal , @entity26 's shameless self - promotion , and @entity27 boring the stuffing out of everyone because she 's too busy gallivanting through @entity30 with @entity31			2
even a fake profile for @entity34 's wife @entity33 was verified			2
and yet ! still no verification for @entity5			1
a prolific tweeter , @entity5 has racked up 618 bad boys in the last 175 days and amassed 17,035 followers			1
she counts @entity3 luminaries including @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 as her friends and yet still no verification			1
knowing that @entity3 heavily favors accounts with an associated website , corporate affiliation , or advertising bent ( she has none of these ) , @entity5 finagled an e-mail address for someone at @entity3 and dashed off this missive ( per @entity54 ) : " hello , @entity5 here			1
people to whom i am not related know me as an actress and comedian , as well as one of the parties responsible for bringing @entity10 and others into the lexicon			2
occasionally , my followers inquire / question my legitimacy			2
how would i go about confirming my identity in order to get verified ? i do n't have a website as i 'm not a company in the traditional sense			0
hoping you 'll have some handy help -- thanks ana " cue the radio silence			0
( the company also has not responded to @entity0 's request for comment			0
) though she 's been waging this " personal quest for validation " for weeks now , she has upped her game in the last five hours , posting shots of herself with " @entity7 " co-stars @entity81 , @entity82 , and fellow " snl " vet @entity83 to bolster her cause			0
will her identity be affirmed ? that remains to be seen			0
update : success ! @entity5 's @entity3 account has been verified , witnessed by this tweet : " to all who fought tirelessly for my verification , thank you			1
@entity94 was a long road & in many ways i 'm still needy			0
