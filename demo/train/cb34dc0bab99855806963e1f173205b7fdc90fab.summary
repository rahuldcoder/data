-- the evidence , and the claims : the knife @entity4 says : a knife found in co-defendant @entity7 's house has the dna of @entity9 on the handle and of victim @entity11 on the blade , suggesting it 's the murder weapon			1
defense says : the knife does n't match the shape and size of wounds on @entity19 's body or an outline of the knife left on her bed			1
the defense also presented experts who said dna on the blade was too small to be definitive			0
dna on @entity19 's bra clasp @entity4 says : a bra clasp that was ripped from @entity19 's bra and found on the floor of her room has @entity8 of @entity7 on it , proving he was in the room when she was killed			1
defense says : the bra clasp is contaminated and essentially tainted evidence because it was moved around the crime scene and left there for more than six weeks before it was picked up as evidence			0
@entity40 's confession @entity4 says : during her interrogation , @entity40 said she could hear @entity19 screaming			1
she also pointed the finger early on at @entity11 , who was eventually released			2
the prosecution said @entity40 's false statement proves she is lying and was at the home when @entity19 was killed			1
defense says : @entity40 's statements were made when she was asked to imagine what would have happened that night in her apartment			1
the defense maintains @entity40 pointed the finger at @entity55 because she was confused and pressured			2
eventually the confession was thrown out because @entity40 was not questioned with a lawyer present			2
bloody footprint on bathroom rug @entity4 says : the prosecution attributed a bloody footprint on a rug in the bathroom to @entity7 , which they say proves he was there at the time of the murder			1
defense says : @entity7 's lawyers presented forensic experts who said the print is in no way a match to @entity7 , but instead a match to @entity11 , who was convicted separately in the case			1
the defense focused on @entity7 's hammer toe , which they say would n't leave an imprint like the print found on the mat. the window @entity4 says : a broken window in the home @entity40 shared with @entity19 was an attempt by the @entity88 to stage a break - in as a cover for the murder			1
the prosecution maintains it would be impossible for someone to break the window and climb through the window as proposed by the defense			0
defense says : the window was broken by @entity98 , a known drifter who had broken into homes before			0
defense expert @entity100 simulated how glass would break if a rock were thrown from the outside			0
his testimony included that he believes a burglar could have thrown a rock that way , not from the inside ( to stage a robbery ) as the prosecution maintains			0
allegations of crime scene contamination defense says : the defense has argued that several pieces of key dna were contaminated at the scene			0
crime scene video shows investigators sometimes not wearing gloves or hair coverings , prodding their fingers in @entity19 's wounds , leaving key pieces of evidence at the scene for weeks and moving them around , and at one point breaking a window for no reason			2
@entity4 says : the prosecution has argued that all the evidence was indeed properly handled and that it is n't their job to prove the crime scene work was good enough			0
instead , they say , that 's the job of the defense			0
bloody shoe print in @entity19 's room @entity4 says : the bloody shoe print found next to @entity19 's body belonged to @entity7 and placed him in @entity19 's room when she was murdered			1
defense says : after @entity98 , a man from the @entity143 who was convicted in a separate trial for murdering @entity19 , was found to have a shoe box for shoes matching the print , they argued for a re-examination of the print			2
@entity150 , a coroner and forensic specialist for @entity7 , testified he believes it was wrongly attributed to @entity7 and belongs to @entity98 .			0
