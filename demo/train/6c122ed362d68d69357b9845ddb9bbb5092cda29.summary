-- q : the @entity2 is releasing new guidelines on cervical cancer screenings			2
what 's changed ? a : in the 1930s , cervical cancer was the deadliest women 's cancer in @entity10			1
at that time , it killed more women each year than breast or lung cancer			2
but over the past 80 years , there has been a tremendous decline in the death rate from cervical cancer because of improvements in treatment and screening			2
today , death from cervical cancer is relatively rare in the @entity10 in 2009 , about 4,000 @entity10 women died of cancer of the cervix			1
a review of the medical history of these women showed that the overwhelming majority had never had cervical cancer screening , and most who did were screened more than 10 years before diagnosis			2
this week , the @entity2 is announcing new recommendations for pap tests to screen women for cervical cancer			1
the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) and the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) have also teamed up to publish screening recommendations			0
both the task force and the collaborative groups reviewed scientific literature and came to similar conclusions			0
both sets of guidelines were published wednesday			0
the @entity2 guidelines were published in the @entity49			0
the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 guidelines were published jointly in @entity51 : a @entity52 , the @entity53 and the @entity54			0
it is hoped that these guidelines will lead to less confusion for health care providers and the public			0
the new guidelines advise women to reduce the number of tests they receive over their lifetime			0
this will ensure that women receive the benefits of testing while minimizing the risks			2
most surprising of these recommendations is that women under age 21 should not be tested			1
but it makes sense -- many sexually active women under 21 will develop a human papillomavirus infection , or @entity76 , which can lead to pre-cancerous lesions			1
and when doctors see those lesions on a pap test , they want to treat them			1
yet nearly all of those lesions will disappear on their own without residual effects			0
and those that do not are easily treated years later			0
treating them as soon as they 're spotted can lead to cervical incompetence and miscarriage down the road			0
the task force has also recommended that women over 21 undergo a @entity95 test screening every three years , instead of annually			1
this , too , fits with what we know about this disease : @entity76 can take more than a decade to progress to cervical dysplasia or cancer			2
the @entity38 - @entity39 - @entity40 recommendations include these changes from the previous @entity38 guidelines : all women should start screening at age 21			2
no longer is screening recommended three years after starting vaginal intercourse			0
women aged 21 to 29 should get a pap test ( conventional or liquid - based ) every three years			1
the statement specifically recommends against annual @entity95 testing			0
the former guideline called for a conventional @entity95 test every year , or a liquid - based pap test every two years , for this age group			1
for women 30 and over , pap tests should be done every three years			1
the guidelines recommend against annual or more frequent pap testing for this age group			2
the previous guidelines said women 30 and over who have had three normal pap tests in a row may be tested less often -- every two to three years			1
combining the pap test with @entity76 testing every three to five years is the preferred strategy for women aged 30 and older			1
screening is not recommended for women 65 or older who have had three or more normal pap tests in a row and no abnormal pap test results in the past 10 years , or who have had two or more negative hpv tests in the past 10 years			1
additional recommendations are also included in the proposed guidelines : women who have a normal @entity95 result and a positive hpv test result should repeat both tests or receive a gene test called genotyping that determines if they have @entity76 16 and 18			1
these types of @entity147 are known to cause 70 % of cervical cancers			0
there is no immediate need for a colposcopy			0
( hpv 16 and 18 are the most common causes of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer			0
) women with a mildly abnormal @entity157 ( called @entity158 ) and a negative hpv test result should follow up with either hpv testing plus a pap test , or hpv testing alone , at intervals of three years or longer			1
women who have been vaccinated against @entity76 should begin cervical cancer screening at the same age as unvaccinated women , i.e. at age 21			1
the views and opinions expressed in this report are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of @entity0 or the @entity38 .			0

in 2009 , about 4,000 @entity10 women died of cervix cancer
new recommendations : women under 21 should not be tested
combining the pap test and @entity76 testing every 3 to 5 years is preferred for ages 30 and older
