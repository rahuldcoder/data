-- in fall 2012 , @entity1 was in a bad mood			1
the 5 - foot - 6 - inch teacher weighed 235 pounds and suffered back pain almost constantly			1
she was popping 10 to 15 ibuprofen daily , which took a toll on her stomach			1
it did n't help that she was on her feet most of the day and dealing with the stress and exhaustion of being a relatively new teacher			1
her husband never once said anything about her weight , which made her feel worse about not taking care of herself			1
she had quit smoking , but knew she needed to get active because climbing stairs still left her winded			1
" i really married the most sweet , wonderful , compassionate man in the world			1
he never made me feel bad about it , so i think i felt more guilty , " said @entity1 , 29 , a high - school agriculture teacher who lives in the @entity21 , @entity22 , area			1
she remembers thinking , " why are n't you taking the initiative ? this man loves you for who you are			1
" she had never had the body she wanted			2
by that november , she had had enough			2
she was done being just the outgoing , funny girl			1
she was done being heavy			2
" i found myself crying in bed one night over my weight , and my husband told me that he thought i was beautiful , but if i was so unhappy , i should do something about it , " @entity1 wrote on @entity30			1
" this triggered something in me			2
" the very next day , she said , she began monitoring her calories and walking or riding the stationary bicycle six days a week			2
after two months , she was brave enough to step foot inside a gym			2
that was january 3 , 2013			2
soon after , she signed up for her first @entity43 class			2
it was the beginning of her new life			2
@entity1 started sampling every available evening dance class			1
as the daughter of an aerobic dance instructor , the movements came easily			2
by the third week , she wanted to be there all the time , dancing to exhaustion under the club lights in the gym 's group fitness room			2
she supplemented classes with one to two nights working out on the elliptical machine and lifting weights			2
" my instructors were amazing , and made me feel like they loved having me there , " she said			0
" i was having a blast exercising for the first time in my life			0
" one of her instructors , now a close friend , found her on @entity66 and would message her if @entity1 missed a class			1
she also offered to make her cds with music she noticed @entity1 liked in class			1
after 10 months , @entity1 's teacher encouraged her to get certified to teach her own classes			1
@entity1 has been teaching @entity43 and other classes that combine fitness and dance for the past four months , in addition to the classes she takes			1
" you really feel like you 're in a club , dancing with people , but you do n't have a hangover in the morning			0
at the end of it , you feel awesome , you 're exhausted , and you can go back and do it tomorrow if you want			0
it 's good for your soul , if you ask me			0
" @entity1 knew exercise was n't enough to really get healthy			1
she had to change her eating habits , too			0
she did n't follow a particular diet , but stuck to a few principles			0
the first few months , she rarely ate out , if at all , and cut out fast food in favor of salmon or grilled chicken with vegetables			0
at school , she ate a protein shake or bar for breakfast , a banana , apple , pear or some clementines for a snack , more fruit and a low - calorie frozen dinner for lunch			0
she used a calorie counter app on her phone to track her intake , sticking to about 1,500 to 1,700 calories per day based on how fast or slow she was losing weight			1
she also cut out dairy , which was probably the hardest sacrifice			0
" i could drink a whole gallon of whole milk in two days			0
i really , really liked cheese and milk a lot , " she said			0
" it was difficult at first because i was so conditioned to eating cheese , but i felt better			0
" after a couple of months , she allowed herself one cheat meal a week -- two bacon and egg taquitos from her favorite fast food chain every tuesday			0
she still has that ritual , but is a little freer with her diet on the weekends			0
when @entity1 started her weight loss journey in november 2012 , at 235 pounds , she wore size 22 pants and was about 42 % body fat			1
within 14 months , she was down to 135 pounds , a size 6 and 21 % body fat			1
her back pain is almost completely gone , she has her dream body and is " the happiest i have ever been			0
" " i ca n't believe how easy it was -- how fast the weight came off when i was doing the right thing , " she said			0
" i 'm thrilled out of my mind with my body			0
" her husband , @entity145 , says @entity1 has always been beautiful , but it 's clear to him how much better she feels			1
" i 'm very proud of her , and i would choose the way she feels now over however she looks , " he said			0
" she 's happier , and she is just a fun person to be around			0
it 's the kind of person you want to be married to			0
" @entity1 fluctuates between 130 and 135 pounds and considers herself to be in maintenance mode ; she carries around some extra skin from the weight loss , but will happily accept the extra skin over the extra weight			1
" if i could give one piece of advice to anyone struggling with their weight , it would be to find something active that you love doing , and do n't give up , " @entity1 said			1
" consistency is key to making any lifestyle changes			0
find a support system and tell people what you are trying to do for yourself			0
when you say it out loud , you become accountable			0

@entity1 had never been a skinny girl
in 2012 , she weighed 235 pounds
losing 100 pounds was " way easier than i ever thought , " @entity1 said
