-- the @entity2 , the @entity3 and @entity4 are filing a challenge with the @entity6 against @entity8 's export restrictions on minerals that are crucial for the production of many high - tech devices , president @entity1 announced tuesday			1
in a statement to reporters at the @entity14 , @entity1 said the case seeks to force @entity8 to lift export limits on certain minerals known as rare earths			1
@entity8 produces 97 % of all rare earths , according to the @entity3			1
the materials are used in products such as flat - screen televisions , smart phones , hybrid car batteries , wind turbines , energy - efficient lighting , electronics , cars and petroleum			0
" we want our companies building those products right here in @entity2 , " @entity1 said			1
" but to do that , @entity2 manufacturers need to have access to rare earth materials which @entity8 supplies			1
now , if @entity8 would simply let the market work on its own , we 'd have no objections			0
" instead , @entity8 policies " currently are preventing that from happening and they go against the very rules that @entity8 agreed to follow , " @entity1 continued			1
what 's the deal with rare earth minerals ? in an earlier statement , the @entity3 said the challenge mounted with @entity49 and @entity50 " formally requested dispute settlement consultations with @entity8 in the @entity6			1
" however , @entity2 sen. @entity52 , @entity54 - @entity53 , said tougher steps are needed than the dispute resolution requested			0
" there are faster ways to assert leverage on @entity8 than relying on the @entity6 , which could take years to resolve the case , " @entity52 said in a statement that called for @entity2 efforts to block @entity8 - funded mining projects in the @entity2 as well as @entity61 financing for @entity8 mining projects			1
@entity67 defended its approach tuesday			0
" @entity8 has worked out its own policy on managing rare earths , which is in line with @entity6 regulations , " @entity69 , a spokesman for the @entity8 @entity70 , said at a news conference			1
" our policies tackle not only the export of rare earth but also its production and exploration			0
" the @entity2 accuses @entity8 of hoarding the valuable minerals for its own use			2
but @entity8 said its restrictions are motivated by environmental concerns			0
@entity14 press secretary @entity86 told reporters tuesday that the issue is about uniform rules for all , rather than an effort to hurt @entity8			1
" we believe that @entity8 's rise is a good thing for the @entity8 people and for the global community , a good thing for the @entity2 , " @entity86 said			2
" it is also important that , as @entity8 becomes a bigger and bigger economic power , that @entity8 play by the same set of rules that other major economic powers play by			0
" @entity8 will have 10 days to respond to the case and must hold talks with the other parties within two months			0
the @entity3 statement said the challenge to the @entity6 targets raw materials including 17 rare earths such as cerium , neodymium and dysprosium , as well as tungsten and molybdenum			1
the elements and substances are used in high - tech and " green " businesses , as well as in cars , machinery manufacturing , chemicals and steel			1
@entity122 is used in lighting technology , in electronics and in automotive , aerospace and medical technologies , the @entity3 statement said			0
@entity8 produces 91 % of the world 's tungsten			1
molybdenum is a metallic element used for filaments in light bulbs			0
@entity8 produces 36 % of the world 's molybdenum , according to the @entity3 statement			1
most of the time , rare earths can not be substituted for without resulting in a redesigned and more costly product , the @entity3 statement said , adding : " their non-availability can lead to the disruption of whole value chains			1
" @entity8 has gradually tightened export restrictions on the materials through raising export taxes and " drastically reducing the export quota , " according to the @entity3			2
in 2010 , @entity8 reduced the quota by 32 % for domestic companies and 54 % for foreign - invested companies			2
" because @entity8 is a top global producer for these key inputs , its harmful policies artificially increase prices for the inputs outside of @entity8 while lowering prices in @entity8 , " said a tuesday statement from the @entity2 trade representative			2
" this price dynamic creates significant advantages for @entity8 's producers when competing against @entity2 producers -- both in @entity8 's market and in other markets around the world , " said the @entity2 statement			2
" the improper export restraints also contribute to creating substantial pressure on @entity2 and other @entity167 downstream producers to move their operations , jobs and technologies to @entity8			2
" the @entity6 , the body tasked with monitoring trade between nations , will be asked to be a facilitator in talks with @entity8 , an @entity1 administration official said monday			1
" @entity8 's restrictions on rare earths and other products violate international trade rules and must be removed , " @entity177 , @entity3 trade commissioner , said in a statement			1
" these measures hurt our producers and consumers in the @entity3 and across the world , including manufacturers			0
" despite a recent ruling in a separate dispute over different raw materials , " @entity8 has made no attempt to remove the other export restrictions , " he said			0
" this leaves us no choice but to challenge @entity8 's export regime again to ensure fair access for our businesses to these materials			0
" @entity201 , the @entity2 trade representative , said , " @entity2 's workers and manufacturers are being hurt in both established and budding industrial sectors by these policies			0
@entity8 continues to make its export restraints more restrictive , resulting in massive distortions and harmful disruptions in supply chains for these materials throughout the global marketplace			0
" concern in the @entity2 over the supply of rare earths resulted in a september hearing on the matter by the @entity217 on @entity218 and the @entity219			1
of particular concern was how vital the minerals are for top - of - the - line weapons , including missile guidance systems , drones and the new @entity225			0
@entity2 companies are trying to answer the demand			0
@entity228 , one of the few producers of rare earth minerals outside @entity8 , has urged @entity231 to do more to confront the problem and encourage research and development			0
@entity228 has mines in @entity236 and @entity237			0
in 2010 , @entity8 temporarily halted shipments of rare earths to @entity4 , prompting a sharp spike in prices of the minerals			1
the @entity3 said it has raised the issue repeatedly with @entity8 over the past few years without success			2
if no solution can be found through the consultation process , the dispute can be transmitted to a @entity6 panel for a ruling , the @entity3 said			2
@entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity8 growth is good , but @entity67 must follow the rules , the @entity14 says
president @entity1 says the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 take action
@entity8 says its policy on rare earths is in line with @entity6 regulations
@entity8 produces 97 % of all rare earths , which are used to make high - tech products
