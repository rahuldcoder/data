-- @entity1 was hanging lights on her house in @entity4 , @entity5 , the week before @entity6 in 1998			1
reaching to put up a giant yellow star on the end of the eave , @entity1 felt the ladder she was on start to wobble			2
glancing down , she saw her 3 - year - old daughter playing below			1
" i just panicked , " she says			2
worried the ladder would fall on the toddler , @entity1 jumped off , landing unnaturally on the front part of her left foot			2
the foot was swollen for days , and @entity1 remembers hobbling around through the holidays , certain she had a hairline fracture			1
@entity1 's story is n't unusual			2
in november and december 2010 ( the latest data available ) , more than 13,000 people were treated in hospital emergency rooms due to injuries related to holiday decorating , according to the @entity26			1
dr. @entity27 , an emergency medicine physician at @entity28 in @entity29 , says falls are " hands down the most common reason why we 'll see folks this time of year			1
" usually these injuries fall into one of three categories , @entity27 says : older men or women who are putting up lights outside and hurt their head or neck ; middle - aged men who 've had a couple of drinks while decorating and injure their shoulders or wrists ; and kids who are trying to assist and end up with head lacerations or concussions			1
@entity27 remembers one horrifying incident from years ago : a man who was hanging decorations on his house eve slipped and managed to get his neck tangled in a string of lights			2
" his feet were on the ladder			2
the ladder could have slipped ; he could have hung himself , " he says			2
fortunately the man was rescued by a neighbor , but the accident left a ligature mark across his throat			2
it 's not always decorations that pose a danger during the holidays			1
each year , fires kill approximately 400 @entity71 and cause more than $ 990 million in damage , according to the @entity73			1
christmas trees are often the first item ignited , the @entity74 says			0
if you 're buying a live tree this year , make sure to check it for freshness by looking at the color ( it should be green , not brown ) and needles ( they should n't break when bent or fall off branches easily ) , according to the @entity26			1
and always place a tree away from heat sources like an air vent or fireplace			0
if you choose an artificial tree , look for a " fire resistant " label , the @entity26 says			0
candles are another fire hazard			0
the @entity26 recommends using flameless candles if you have young children or pets , and placing real candles away from materials that will catch on fire easily			0
make sure to extinguish all candles before going to bed at night			0
@entity27 says the second most common injuries his staff sees during the holiday season are caused by " alcohol - and ... " accidents : alcohol and a motor vehicle ; alcohol and an altercation ; alcohol and cooking knives			1
" there 's ample time for people to get out and party , and make less - than - fortunate decisions , " @entity27 says			1
inappropriate presents -- or those that are n't well - thought out -- can also put people at risk			1
some of the most hazardous gifts have wheels , @entity27 says			0
from kids who ca n't wait to test out their new bikes to adults who ca n't wait to test out their new motorcycles , head and spinal injuries are often seen in the er around the holidays			1
" the message for folks is that if it rolls or requires a helmet , make sure you gift the helmet , " @entity27 says			0
" do n't rely on the person ... to buy their helmet later on			0
they will get hurt on christmas day			0
" doctors also see gun and knife - related injuries post-christmas			1
recipients eager to show off their new gifts are often reckless with the safety of themselves and those around them , @entity27 says			0
you would think such tales might make @entity126 staff question the intelligence of the human race			0
" you know what it really does ? it gives you a great appreciation for the humility of human circumstances , " @entity27 says			0
" if you really approach it honestly , you and i would do the same thing			0
" like when you forget to turn off the outside @entity164 lights and sneak outside in your bare feet -- only to end up slipping on a patch of ice			0
or thinking you 're more than old enough to roller - blade without a helmet , until your head hits the pavement			1
" everybody 's ( injury ) story began with something really plausible , " @entity27 warns			0
