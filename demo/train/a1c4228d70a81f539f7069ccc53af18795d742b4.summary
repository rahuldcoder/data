-- " @entity4 " is n't the kind that @entity2 , @entity3 , wants around			1
the horror movie tries to say that documented disappearances of @entity2 residents are the result of alien abductions and that 's just @entity11 hooey , said mayor @entity12			1
" people need to realize that this is a science fiction thriller , " @entity12 said			1
she said town residents have been getting a lot of phone calls lately , and frankly , they 're a bit tired of talking about it			0
" some of the calls i 'm just ignoring , " @entity12 said , " because the issue we had to deal with in real life was very sensitive			2
the movie is portraying something like the ' @entity26 , ' and we 're just hoping the message gets out that this is supposed to be for entertainment			2
" in real life , there was a string of disappearances in the small town on the west coast of @entity3 , not far from the @entity34			1
in 2005 , the @entity35 was brought in to investigate			0
the victims were largely native men traveling to the town from smaller villages , according to the @entity39			0
the @entity35 looked into about 20 cases , finding alcohol and frigid temperatures to be causes			0
nine bodies were never found			2
" @entity4 , " which comes out friday , uses the disappearances as a jumping - off point for an alien abduction yarn , using " archived footage " to create an atmosphere of documentary realism			1
it 's not a new idea ; " the @entity26 " pulled off the concept effectively , and the recent " @entity56 " uses handheld cameras for a cinema verite look			0
but unlike " @entity57 , " " @entity4 " literally announces its validity , taking @entity2 's documented unexplained disappearances and making the case for alien abductions			1
the film does rely very heavily on the tagline " what do you believe ? " letting viewers decide for themselves what 's real and what 's @entity11 , but it also conflates the two for its convenience			1
for example , the title itself is derived from a " scale of measurement " that was " developed in 1972 " to categorize alien encounters , best known through its use in @entity80 's " @entity79			0
" ( on the scale , the first kind of encounter is defined as a @entity85 sighting ; the second , collected evidence of extraterrestrials ; and the third kind is contact			0
) however , @entity91 , a physics professor at the @entity92 , @entity93 , who has studied the possibility of extraterrestrial life , doubts its validity			0
" honestly , i 've only ever heard of it through fiction , " he said , " not as an actual scientific scale of measurement			2
" the " fourth kind " is alien abduction , the hardest encounter to prove until now , said @entity106 , parent company of distributor @entity107 , in a press release			0
first time writer / director @entity109 was unavailable for comment , but according to a fact sheet handed out at screenings , he discovered the disappearances that plagued @entity2 in 2004 when a friend told him of a dr. @entity115			1
during sleep studies " in fall 2000 , the therapist 's patients , under hypnosis , exhibited behaviors that suggested encounters with nonhumans , " the statement read			0
according to the press material , @entity124 recorded footage depicting disturbing scenes , which director @entity109 uses alongside re-enactments starring @entity129 and @entity130 in a split screen			1
to further push the reality bit , @entity129 informs the audience right up front that she " plays the role of dr. @entity115 , " and that the images they are about to see are very disturbing			1
" i think that it 's fun to have fictional movies about the possibility of extraterrestrial life , but it 's important for the public to understand the difference between science and science fiction , " @entity91 said			1
" almost all scientists i know believe that there 's no evidence of encounters between humans and alien life forms			0
right now , astronomers are [ still ] trying to find evidence of very simple life forms in space			0
" film reviewer @entity157 said he tried to watch the movie with an open mind			1
" i was receptive to the possibility that it could be real , [ and ] i think that it was convincing enough to make it kind of scary - fun , " the @entity161 reviewer said			2
" within five minutes of walking out of the movie and talking with my girlfriend and somebody else , the whole movie sort of logically falls apart in terms of authenticity , " he said			1
but , @entity157 added , " it 's not deceptive ; it 's what their marketing campaign is			0
" but why market fiction as truth in the first place ? found footage and documentary-esque filmmaking changes the atmosphere of a film , @entity157 said			1
instead of walking into a trap a la " @entity184 , " viewers get a " really creepy atmosphere even when nothing is going on			2
" recently , the latter has been more successful than the former , with " @entity56 " topping the latest " @entity184 " at the box office			0
" people want to see themselves as specifically connected or reflected in entertainment , " he said			0
" something like ' @entity56 ' or ' @entity4 ' sort of accesses that desire to be recognized or famous			2
" for example , by casting @entity129 the movie deliberately pretties up @entity124 , which makes the found footage seem all the more true , @entity157 said			1
" the most authentic thing in the movie is how the real woman is much less attractive than @entity129 , which automatically gives that woman 's case some authenticity , " @entity157 said			1
" she 's accessible in a normal , human way			0
" but whether it 's real or not , is it scary ? it all depends on what you believe , said film reviewer @entity210			2
" the audience has to ask themselves , ' am i going to believe everything is real because @entity129 told me it is ? ' your answer to that question decides how effective the rest of the film is going to be , " he said			1
" i was skeptical from the start but [ also ] questioning , which is one of the reasons i got a few chills			0
" in @entity2 , however , @entity223 wishes people would get a better grip on the difference between fiction and reality , not to mention geography			1
" we watched the trailer on the @entity233 , and the first scenes are these majestic mountains with these trees , which is totally not @entity2 , " she said , laughing			2
" we 're pretty flat , right by the ocean			0
" according to @entity238 , " @entity4 " was filmed in @entity239			2
" what they should 've done , " @entity12 said , still laughing , " is premiered here at the local theater			0

" @entity4 " is another horror film relying on the " found footage " **technique**
it uses a split screen of " real footage " and re-enactments starring @entity129
officials in @entity2 , @entity3 , where the movie is based , deny those claims , call it science fiction
viewers think the use of this **technique** makes for a good scare , but not authenticity
