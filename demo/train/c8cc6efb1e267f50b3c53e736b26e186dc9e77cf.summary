@entity1 's government has begun unveiling drafts of proposed laws that critics say are motivated by religious hatred , and could take discrimination against the country 's marginalized @entity8 minority to new heights			1
the four bills are based on a petition presented by a group of nationalist @entity15 monks to president @entity16 in july last year , calling for curbs on interfaith marriage and religious conversions , among other measures			1
according to the monks , it 's a matter of protecting race and religion and encouraging peace			1
tensions between the @entity15 majority and @entity8 minority in @entity1 , also known as @entity1 , have been high since deadly violence erupted between the groups in 2012 , as the country emerged from decades of authoritarian military rule			1
a faction of @entity15 nationalists has been criticized , accused of drumming up hostility			2
the first draft bill -- stemming from a request from a coalition of monks known as the @entity40 , and @entity41 -- was published in state media tuesday , with a call for public comment by june 20			2
the proposed law would require anyone seeking to change their religion to obtain permission from a number of different local authorities			2
targeting @entity8 ? while the bill applied to all religions , human rights and civil society groups believe it is driven out of a concern to prevent the spread of @entity58 in the predominantly @entity15 country			1
" the objective is against @entity8 people , " said @entity60 , a member of @entity61 , which belongs to a coalition of women 's groups that has campaigned against a proposed bill on interfaith marriage			1
" almost all parts of these bills are aimed to target @entity8 -- it 's based on hatred against this minority religion			1
" the draft of the accompanying interfaith marriage law is yet to be released			1
but @entity76 and other rights groups , who say they have seen the draft proposal , maintain it calls for @entity15 women to be permitted to marry only @entity15 men , requiring anyone seeking to marry a @entity15 to convert to the religion			1
the suitor would also be required to obtain the written consent of the woman 's parents			0
the proposal also puts forward a 10 - year prison sentence for any non-buddhist who marries a @entity15 in violation of the law , according to @entity76			2
@entity95 , executive director of rights group @entity96 , said that any such law would " give legislative voice to @entity15 fears of a @entity8 takeover			1
it 's patently discriminatory , " he said			0
" the fact that lawmakers in @entity1 are considering a law like this now should serve as a wake - up call to the international community			2
anti-muslim discrimination is reaching unprecedented heights			0
" but @entity1 's presidential spokesman @entity109 said that until the draft bill was released , any comment on its content was " just speculation			1
" " the bill committee is considering all the public advice and opinion on their work , " he said			0
" they have to consider articles in the constitution which grant freedom of religion in our country , and consider other international human rights conventions			2
" limits on family size the other related " race and religion protection " draft bills scheduled to be released soon included ones proposing a ban on polygamy and limits on family size -- also aimed at curbing @entity8 population growth , according to rights groups			1
muslims are estimated to account for about 5 % of @entity1 's nearly 60 million people			1
@entity139 said she feared that the bills , if passed , would lead to further division and violence in the country			0
" our @entity1 society is already ethnically and religiously divided , " she said			2
" we 're in a very early democratic transition period			0
it will lead to more prejudice and discrimination			0
" @entity150 , director of @entity150 , agreed , saying the laws , if passed , would " significantly undermine prospects for peace			0
" " ethnic and religious minorities in @entity1 are already suspicious that the @entity15 dominated central government wants to either assimilate or suppress them , " he said			1
" the interfaith marriage laws play into the greatest fears of ethnic and religious minorities that the government sees the country as a @entity164 @entity15 country where ethnic and religious minorities are not considered equal			1
" @entity139 said her coalition also opposed the interfaith marriage law on the grounds that it impinged on the freedom of women to choose who they married , a retrograde step in a country moving towards democracy , and where there were no existing restrictions on a woman 's right to wed. the bill was also unnecessary , she said , in that marriages of @entity15 women and @entity8 men did not appear to be commonplace			1
" i do n't see an alarming number of @entity15 women marrying @entity8 , " she said adding that marriages between @entity186 and @entity187 were more common , and generally viewed as unproblematic			1
crimes against humanity ? @entity192 @entity8 in parts of the western state of @entity195 are already subject to a controversial " two - child policy " that has been criticized by respected @entity1 politician and human rights icon @entity199			1
rakhine state has been the site of communal violence between @entity192 and the region 's ethnic @entity203 majority , which has displaced tens of thousands of @entity8 , forcing them into camps where they are completely reliant on humanitarian aid supplies			2
in march , @entity208 -- the largest ngo healthcare provider in @entity195 -- was banned from operating in the state , where it had worked for nearly 20 years , because officials accused it of providing preferential treatment to @entity192			0
the developments have triggered a humanitarian crisis , with the @entity216 's @entity215 on @entity1 , @entity217 , declaring last month that persecution of the group " could amount to crimes against humanity , " and @entity76 labeling it " ethnic cleansing			2
" @entity1 authorities have rejected the allegations			0
" in @entity195 , there 's an argument to be made that the government is failing to uphold its obligation to prevent genocide , " said @entity95			0
" passing a discriminatory law like this would n't help the situation there			0
" will the bills pass ? all four draft " race and religion " bills are expected to be completed this month and released to the public for feedback , before they are finalized and submitted to @entity16 for approval by june 30 , according to state media			0
with the @entity244 claiming more than one million signatures in support of the bills , and few willing to speak out against them , opponents fear the measures have a strong chance of passing			0
" such is the @entity253 fervour gripping @entity1 at the moment that even many [ domestic ] human rights activists have been silent on this issue , with women 's groups the only vocal opponents , " said @entity251			2
@entity139 said the moral authority of the monks made it difficult to oppose the legislation			0
members of the women 's coalition that had campaigned against the bill had subsequently been threatened by unknown unidentified extremists			0
" what the monks say , many people do , " she said			0
" our group has been called traitors			0
it 's very difficult for ordinary people to speak out			0

@entity1 's government is considering a law banning interfaith marriage
it is in *response* to a call from extremist @entity15 monks to " protect race and religion "
@entity1 has been *plagued* by violence between @entity186 and @entity8 in recent years
rights organizations fear such laws will create further divisions and prejudice
