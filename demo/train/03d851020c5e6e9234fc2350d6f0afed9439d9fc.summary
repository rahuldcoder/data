the whisky glows like a candle in the bottom of the glass			1
its aroma is rich , deep , musky , inviting			0
but dare i take a sip ? this is the new @entity10 50 - year - old , which carries a price tag of £ 25,000 ( $ 40,800 ) a bottle			1
which means that the single dram i am holding is worth about £ 830 ( $ 1,350 )			1
slowly , i raise it to my lips			0
i am standing in the whisky room at the luxurious @entity19 hotel in @entity20 , @entity21 -- which incidentally is owned by local boy tennis star @entity22 -- along with a select group of journalists			1
we have been invited to the exclusive launch of the new 50 - year - old , which is only the fourth time the distillery has released a whisky of this age			1
" a 50 - year - old @entity33 featured in ( the film ) @entity35 , but whiskies of this age are extremely unusual , " says @entity31 , global brand ambassador for @entity10 , who is introducing us to the latest release			1
" nobody 50 years ago knew that people would care about @entity40 the way they do in 2014			1
nobody planned to leave this whisky for so long			1
its existence is a bit of a miracle			0
" we tilt our glasses			0
the butter - colored liquid is rich with notes of cloves , summer flowers , dried fruits and marzipan , underpinned by the woody polish of an old gymnasium			1
" it tastes like soap , " somebody says			0
" you 've eaten soap ? " @entity31 replies			0
" it reminds me of the inside of a grand piano , " ventures someone else			0
" whisky of this age has a natural alcohol level of below 50 % , " @entity31 explains			1
" that 's when very unpredictable chemical reactions happen between the spirit and the wood			0
that 's the magic time			0
it creates whisky that is unique , quirky and unpredictable			1
" whisky collectors are making big money as extraordinary as this whisky is -- it is exceptionally long , with flavor lingering for several minutes after each sip -- one question is in the back of everyone 's mind			1
who would pay £ 25,000 for a bottle of whisky ? the answer is people like @entity93 , a whisky collector and building tycoon from @entity95 , @entity96 , who once bought a @entity97 64 - year - old for £ 100,000 ( $ 166,000 )			1
" i have about 5,000 bottles , including a lot of old , one - off , high - end whiskies , " he says			1
" over the years , i 've spent about $ 2 million on it			1
the collection is worth about $ 6 million now			1
i keep it at different locations all over the world , for security reasons			0
" @entity93 is one of a breed of whisky collectors that have found that their passion for the drink has led to great financial gains			1
distilleries first hit on the idea of limited editions and special releases in the early nineties , such as the famous @entity120 that came in a wooden presentation case			0
collectors like @entity93 bought the bottles largely for the love of them			1
but over the decades , their value started to appreciate to the extent that unusual bottles started to be seen as cash cows			0
fast - forward to 2014 , and the market is booming			2
according to the @entity132 index that is compiled by @entity134 - based @entity133 , the top 100 whiskies appreciated by an average of 440 % in the last six years			1
last month , a 50 - year - old bottle of @entity140 @entity139 single malt sold for £ 20,000 ( $ 33,000 )			1
in january , @entity141 's sold a six - liter decanter of @entity143 for £ 387,000 ( $ 631,000 )			1
these transactions are becoming relatively frequent , if not commonplace			0
indeed , @entity133 expect 30,000 bottles to be sold at auction this year , a 50 % increase on the 20,211 that were sold in 2013			1
by contrast , the @entity149 stock index increased by 31 % in the same period , and the live - ex @entity151 dropped by 2 %			1
if you 're a drinks investor with money to spend , it is something of a no - brainer			2
is whisky for collecting or drinking ? but most people in the whisky world see collecting purely for the sake of investment as something of a taboo			1
" you have to start by drinking the product and enjoying the product , " says @entity93			0
" buy two bottles , one to drink and one to collect			0
otherwise you 're going against the spirit of the industry			0
" @entity169 , the founding director of @entity133 , agrees -- but only to a point			0
" there are three types of buyers : drinkers , collectors and investors , " he says			2
" i know one person , who shall remain nameless , who is teetotal , and buys whisky only to invest			2
" some people think that this is a crime and whisky should be set free			1
but from my perspective , people can choose how to spend their money			0
it 's supporting the industry and that 's a good thing			0
" @entity188 , a former corporate banker , is launching a new business called @entity190 101 , which he describes as " consultants , brokers and valuers "			0
" @entity190 has always been collectable , but there were no market figures before @entity133 came along five years ago , " he says			2
" there were no indices , charts , graphs , nothing			0
rare @entity203 will have the world 's largest online database of whisky auction sales , so investors can accurately follow the market			1
" this is the latest contribution to the digital revolution that has transformed the secondary whisky market			2
physical auction houses like @entity213 and @entity214 's have traditionally tended to charge 25 % commission , and hold auctions just a few times a year			1
by contrast , sites like @entity40 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 run online auctions regularly , and charge a commission of just 10 %			2
" those sites have added liquidity into a traditionally illiquid market , " says @entity188			0
" they are part of the reason why whisky is booming , and the growing value of whisky is starting to usurp the experience of opening and drinking it			2
" @entity190 investment funds : too good to be true ? the market is gradually showing signs of maturity			1
in june , the world 's first whisky investment fund was set up by @entity241 , the ceo of @entity242 in @entity243 ; another has been established in @entity245			1
but many seasoned collectors -- who themselves have made millions through buying and selling whisky -- are skeptical about whisky funds , and suggest that potential investors tread carefully			1
" they worry me because genuine whisky experts are few and far between , and there is nobody credible behind these funds , " says @entity250 , founder of the @entity251 , who boasts a " handsome " private collection of 6,000 bottles that he keeps in his boardroom			1
" they are run by people from the wine industry , but you need a lot of knowledge specifically about whisky to make good investments			2
it 's not about just buying old whisky			2
i 've been collecting for 30 years and i know everyone who is good			2
how many whiskies have these guys tried ? fifty ? a hundred ? that 's not enough			2
" there are lots of hidden pitfalls , he says			0
for example , if you invest in a whisky that is not " amazing to drink " , demand may remain low even if it is a limited edition			2
and while some bottles go up , it is common for others to lose value			0
for example , the @entity288 limited edition @entity33 whisky , which marked the marriage between the @entity290 and @entity291 in 2011 , rose from £ 150 to £ 1,650 by 2013			1
these days , however , after the distillery lost many fans by removing age statements from its bottles , it has depreciated to about £ 900			2
by contrast , however , the iconic @entity299 whisky , which was released in 1996 to mark the 35th anniversary of the @entity134 satirical magazine , has appreciated from £ 35 to about £ 1,500 , and shows no sign of falling from grace			1
telling the difference between these two whiskies requires significant expertise			2
the importance of loving your whisky according to @entity250 , when it comes to whisky collecting , there is no substitute for genuine passion			2
he still vividly remembers the first bottle in his collection			0
" i visited a man in @entity21 , and noticed a special bottle on his mantelpiece , with a beautiful , intensely colorful label , " he says			1
" it was an original bottling from a distillery called @entity324 , which had closed in the early 1900s			0
" i knew i had to have it			0
it took me half an hour to persuade him to sell it to me , for £ 700 , which was a lot of money at the time			2
it 's worth about £ 20,000 now , but i 'll never sell it			0
" what advice would he offer an aspiring collector or investor ? " the whisky market is on fire at the moment , it really is , " he says			0
" but you ca n't become an expert overnight			0
" as a rule of thumb , buy limited edition bottles from iconic distilleries			0
but most importantly , learn about whisky , meet the experts and talk to them , and drink as much as you can			0
" back in the honeyed presence of the @entity10 50 - year - old , @entity31 is inclined to agree			1
" ultimately , whisky is about loving the mystery of the drink , conversation and friendship , " he says			0
" @entity190 is to be drunk and enjoyed			0
however high the stakes get , you can never lose sight of that			0
" @entity360 : the life , death and rebirth of a @entity365 icon biodesign : why the future of our cities is soft and hairy flying monkeys and winged goats : photos that make you question reality			0
