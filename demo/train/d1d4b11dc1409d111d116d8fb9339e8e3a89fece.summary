-- @entity1 , love and like			2
a healthful , happy love relationship serves up three out of three			2
a healthful , happy love relationship is a passionate best friendship			2
modern women could learn a few things about love and seduction from @entity11			1
many women think men only care about the lust angle -- finding a hot bod for hot sex			1
unfortunately , there are many men who do only care about this			2
in my book " @entity22 , " i explain how relationships that are too focused on sex wind up being what my favorite philosopher buddy @entity25 called a relationship of pleasure -- where you find a sex - mate or a relationship of utility -- where you find an ego - mate or wallet - mate			0
however , a healthful , happy love relationship is what @entity25 calls a relationship of shared virtue -- when you find a soul mate			1
where you each get one another at your core , inspire and support each other to grow into your best possible selves			0
a relationship of shared virtue is where you feel the whole triumvirate : lust , love and like			0
meaning ? if you want to fully seduce a man , then you 've got to know how to grab a man by more than his you - know - what			0
you must truly turn on a man 's soul ! @entity0 : 5 things that make you sexy if you sleep with a man before you feel safe knowing you connect on a soul - to - soul level , the relationship might start off hot -- but like steam into air , it will rise quickly then -- pfffft -- vanish into vapor			1
or worse , you 'll wind up getting burnt			0
this is so important to prioritize , that i 'm repeating this reminder in bold italic letters : if you ca n't stimulate a man in more areas than from the waist down , you will only be attracting a relationship of pleasure or a relationship of utility			1
and this man will not remain your man for long			0
one of my favorite quotes about love comes from the book " @entity82 " : " it 's only with the heart that one can see rightly ; what 's most important is invisible to the eye			0
" i love that the @entity82 recognized that the heart ( another metaphysical word for soul ) is the best lens for love -- making this @entity82 a major @entity92			1
seduction tip 1 ( in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember ) : if you want to be a man 's @entity95 , you must do more than work on tightening your buns or boosting up your boobs ! you must tap into what i call " the @entity102			1
" @entity0 : what to do before you can find love remember the tale of @entity11 and her 1,001 nights ? @entity11 was absolutely a @entity108 who knew how to grab and stimulate her king 's soul			1
voilà ! the @entity111 on @entity11 : there once was a king who got very bored with the women in his life very quickly			1
he would marry a new virgin , " shtup " her , then send her pretty self away pretty much immediately ... to be beheaded			0
talk about a bad breakup , huh ? and talk about a @entity120 , huh ? anyway , this king killed thousands of women by the time he finally met the enchantingly different @entity11			1
what made @entity11 enchantingly different ? @entity11 loved to read books and had lots of fascinating ideas and interests to share			1
wisely educated in morality and kindness , she had a passion for poetry , philosophy , sciences and arts			0
she kept the king on the edge of his bed -- not with mere alluring sexual positions -- but with alluring stories to be told , each more exciting than the next			1
and so the king kept @entity11 alive -- eagerly anticipating each new tale -- until , lo and behold , 1,001 adventurous nights passed -- along with three sons -- and the king not only learned to love @entity11 , but he made her his queen			1
talk about living happily ever after , huh ? the lesson learned ? it 's very seductive to a man when you , as a full - bodied and full souled woman , have passions in your life you can share to keep him inspired , titillated , growing and thriving			0
seduction tip 2 ( again in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember ) : the more passions you have in your life , the more passion your man will have for you ! @entity0 : 4 steps to finding your passion my friend @entity161 told me he fell in love with his wonderful wife of 13 years because he adored her " world lens " -- all the interesting perspectives she shared about life , all her passionate insights and enthusiastic talents			1
@entity161 's idea of love is being turned on by how his paramour looked at the world , instead of simply focusing on how she looked to the world			0
which is why @entity161 is a @entity176 @entity92 who 's found his @entity11			1
unfortunately , i believe too many women feel that the best way to catch a guy is with the bait of their ( to word it politely ) " vajayjay			1
" but if that is the main lure for love , then why are n't little " vajayjay icons " found on @entity188 cards ? i 'm kidding -- but i am serious ! if you sleep with a man too soon , you risk being dizzied by an " oxytocin high , " and you will not know until you 're already emotionally entrenched if the two of you have a true soul - nurturing connection			1
plus , even in this modern world , you also risk the man respecting you less if you give sex away too quickly			0
the harder you are to win , the bigger your estimated prize value			0
many men do not want to belong to a club that has touched their members too quickly			0
it 's the ol ' dr. ejaculate / mr. @entity205			0
as soon as the man comes , he 'll want to go			0
seduction tip 3 ( back to bold italics one last time for good measure ) : if you ever wan na hear " i do , " you have to start off saying a lot of sexual " i don'ts			1
" for this reason , i recommend to the women i coach that they do not drink alcohol on dates			2
staying alcohol - free will help ensure you clearly " hear " who a guy is , not simply " see " who he is			2
you do n't want to be hypnotized by superficial qualities , like his looks and wealth			2
plus , being alcohol - free will help make sure you do n't move too swiftly forward physically ( a.k.a. it will ensure you keep your vajayjay in your skirt ! )			2
meaning ? my overall big seduction tip for luring in healthful , happy relationship is to stop trying to be seductive ! if you focus too much on seducing a man with your body and beauty , you will only be luring in a man with your body and beauty			2
if you want to wisely be in a lust , love and like relationship of shared virtue , it 's far more important that you excite a man 's soul			2

@entity11 kept her head on her *shoulders* by keeping her king interested
her 1001 stories seduced his mind and soul
*relying* on physical seduction often leads to *heartbreak* than *happiness*
expert : if women want to hear " i do " they need to say " i do n't " many times
