-- @entity2 's character and history are closely linked to its waterside location , so it makes sense to start your sightseeing at the @entity8			2
experience the @entity10 / @entity10			1
pioneers first settled in @entity12 in the 1850s and these days the @entity8 area is buzzing with restaurants , bars and tourists			0
kids will love the @entity19 ( @entity20 59 , 1483 @entity21 ) , while adults will want to head straight to @entity23 ( @entity24 )			1
more than just an outstanding farmers market , @entity23 is in many ways the beating heart of @entity2			1
browse the farm - fresh produce and traditional crafts , and banter with the infamous salmon - tossing fishmongers , whose tourist - pleasing antics mix market trading with street theatre			2
after stocking up on snacks and souvenirs , venture further into the historic @entity40 neighborhood and check out the totem poles in @entity42			0
there 's another totem pole in @entity45 , carved by the @entity47 natives in 1938 , as well as a bust of @entity49 of the @entity51 tribe , after whom @entity2 is named			0
nearby , the @entity53 ( 1000 @entity54 ) is an astonishing glass and steel construction by @entity57			0
only slightly less imposing is the pink granite structure that is @entity59 ( 1300 @entity60 ) and the 48 - foot " @entity61 " that guards its entrance			2
the museum is known for its collections of @entity66 and @entity67 art , while @entity69 art is showcased at the @entity70 ( 1400 @entity71 , @entity72 ) in @entity73			0

to get there , take the monorail , another @entity83 remnant , from the @entity87 ( @entity88 at @entity89 )			2
ride a glass elevator to the 160 - meter - high observation deck for an incredible view of the city and its surroundings			1
while you 're at the @entity82 , take a look at the @entity10 / @entity10			1
the colorfully bizarre building by @entity98 looks like a three - dimensional cubist collage of smashed electric guitars , and is @entity103 co-founder @entity102 's eccentric gift to the city			2
originally a museum dedicated to @entity2 native @entity105 , the @entity10 now has all kinds of rock memorabilia and loads of interactive exhibitions			1
tickets include admission to the @entity112 , which has enough sci - fi movie props to satisfy the most obsessive trekkie			0
finally , make time to stroll around the @entity73 and @entity117 neighborhoods for a taste of the non-conformist " alternative @entity2 " that brought the world @entity119 and made plaid shirts fashionable			0
where to stay what to see where to be seen where to eat where to shop ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
