-- @entity1 said he was " pleased " with his switch to a new racket as he began his 2014 @entity3 campaign with a straight sets victory over fellow 32 - year - old @entity5 in @entity6 wednesday			1
@entity1 used the larger - headed racket in a doubles match the night before , but this was his first significant test with the new equipment			1
@entity14 was admittedly ideal opposition , he had lost 13 previous encounters with the @entity18 star , and slipped to a 6 - 4 6 - 2 defeat in 69 minutes in the second round match			1
@entity1 is playing in @entity21 in the opening week of the season for the first time since 2000 and is proving a big draw in @entity25			1
he slipped to @entity26 in the rankings in 2013 and has hired @entity28 to his coaching team to help restore his fortunes			0
there has also been the introduction of a 98 - inch racket head , an experiment he briefly tried after going out early at @entity36 last summer			2
@entity1 is satisfied with the results and lost only five service points in the second set against @entity5			2
" i had a much longer time to get ready for this swing than i had last time around , after @entity36 , before the @entity45 summer , " he told the @entity3 official website			0
" so i 'm not thinking about it when i 'm going out there , which is a great thing			0
i 'm hitting the ball really well , so i 'm very pleased with the racquet			0
" he is competing in the doubles with @entity52 to ramp up his preparation for the opening grand slam in a fortnight			0
" now i have doubles tomorrow and the singles the next day , so it 's really good for rhythm and good for your game			0
" i expect myself to play a bit better in the next match , even though today was already very good for a first match in so many weeks , to be honest , and against @entity5 who can play very good tennis			0
" in the women 's singles in @entity6 , second seed @entity68 scored an impressive second round success over @entity21 's @entity72			1
the reigning @entity74 champion served notice she will battle to keep that title with a 6 - 3 6 - 1 win over the local hope to reach the quarterfinals where she will play unseeded @entity18 @entity81			1
a title match - up is looming against top seed @entity83 , who is also into the last eight after beating @entity85 on @entity86			0
@entity83 's elder sister @entity87 has reached the same stage of the @entity90 event in @entity91 , @entity92			0
the 33 - year - old @entity83 trailed by a set and looked set for an upset defeat to @entity95 before a typical rally			0
she won 10 out of 13 games to clinch a 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 victory			1
later wednesday , there was a shock defeat for @entity36 champion @entity101 at the @entity102 to @entity104 @entity103			2
@entity101 is playing his first competitive matches since back surgery last autumn , but looked well in control when he led by a set and 3 - 0			2
@entity103 , ranked 40th in the world , refused to give up and proceeded to win 11 of the last 14 games for a 3 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 2 victory			1
top seed @entity112 survived a scare against another @entity104 , @entity115 , dropping the second set in @entity117 before prevailing 6 - 3 6 - 7 6 - 3 .			1

@entity1 kick starts 2014 campaign with straight sets win
@entity123 @entity124 6 - 4 6 - 2 in 69 minutes in @entity6
