-- evidence is mounting that it is possible to control the virus that causes @entity4 with early treatment , so further therapy is not immediately needed			1
a recent study in the journal @entity9 reports that 14 patients with @entity11 , who received antiretroviral treatment within 10 weeks of infection , had their viral loads decreased so much that scientists say they are " functionally cured			1
" " the amazing thing is that it seems that by early treatment , we can induce this type of control of infection in 10 - 15 % of individuals , " says lead study author @entity16 of the @entity17 in @entity18			1
the usual definition of a " cure " is that someone who was once infected has no virus left in his or her body			0
but in situations like this one , it can be said that there is " sustained remission that does n't require therapy , " says dr. @entity37 , director of the @entity39 's @entity38			1
that 's what scientists call a " functional cure			0
" " you have n't eradicated the virus , but interestingly , when you stop therapy , even though the virus is still there and you can measure it , it does n't come back with a vengeance and cause disease in the person , " he says			2
these 14 were identified out of 70 people with @entity11 whose treatment had been interrupted			1
the virus in these patients is not completely eradicated , even though they have been off therapy for up to about 10 years			2
there is still a possibility that disease will return in these patients , but the chances are low , @entity37 says , and being able to live many years without therapy is " a pretty good bonus " of early treatment			1
normally , after a person gets infected with @entity11 and years pass , the virus establishes a reservoir in the long - lived t - cells called lymphocytes , @entity37 explains			2
" those latent cells are kind of like embers of a fire , and when we take our treatment away , those latent embers reignite the infection and a fire breaks out , " says dr. @entity71 , professor at the @entity72 at @entity73 , who was not involved in the study			2
but when a person with @entity11 receives aggressive treatment soon after infection , according to the hypothesis put forth by the study , the virus forms a reservoir in the shorter - lived lymphocytes			1
when therapy was stopped , according to this theory , the viral reservoir was extremely low			0
cases of @entity11 are most often not treated immediately after infection , @entity37 says			2
people commonly find out they have @entity11 because they feel poorly or happen to take an hiv test ; in these situations , the infection may have been in the body for several years already			0
where everyone wants to work with @entity11 the new study 's conclusion " is even greater fortification for the concept of really seeking out people and identify ( ing ) them very very soon after they get infected , and treating them aggressively , " @entity37 says			1
that means screening people in high - risk communities			0
it 's important to understand the distinction between controlling the virus in the new study and so - called " elite controllers , " people who , because of their genetic makeup , are able to control @entity11 naturally			1
fewer than 1 % of people with @entity11 have this immune response			0
@entity16 's study demonstrates a significantly greater probability of control when therapy is administered early			1
@entity16 and colleagues are following up in a clinical trial that looks at 90 @entity11 patients who were treated early			1
the study also gives extra hope that a vaccine could work , @entity71 said , as it suggests that priming the immune system can induce a response that controls the virus			2
" if it can be induced in a large number of people , then i would guess that that immune response could well be protective against an infectious challenge , " @entity71 said			0
this new study adds to another development in the hiv research arena			0
earlier this month , a baby in @entity143 who was born with @entity11 was also shown to be " functionally cured			0
" she received high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of her birth			0
there is no evidence , two years later , that @entity11 is present in her blood			0
this probably does represent a " cure , " more so than in the 14 patients in @entity153 study , but the treatment was delivered much faster than it would be in adults , @entity71 says			1
the baby 's case could change the practice for how high - risk babies are treated , says @entity37			0
usually , babies born to mothers with uncontrolled infections , or whose @entity11 is diagnosed close to delivery time , receive antiviral drugs at preventative doses for six weeks , and then @entity11 therapy if the virus is detected			1
@entity169 can mean no babies with @entity11 in the case of this baby , a more aggressive treatment showcases a potential for a cure with antiretroviral therapy given early , researchers say			1
but the news about the baby is n't a total game - changer for the developed world			0
usually , mothers with @entity11 get treatment so that the infection is not transmitted to their baby in the first place ; for the @entity188 , the situation is a " fluke , " @entity37 said			2
but untreated mothers give birth all the time in @entity192 , for example , making the baby 's case more relevant to the developing world			0
@entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this report .			0

14 patients treated early do n't need @entity11 therapy *anymore*
it 's possible the disease will return , but chances are low
the study shows the importance of early screening and treatment
the results give researchers more hope that a vaccine is possible
