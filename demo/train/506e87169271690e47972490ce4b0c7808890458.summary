it 's been called a " cure for rejection - letter fatigue			2
" @entity3 on thursday released new details about the success of its program for authors who want to self - publish on its kindle e-reader devices			1
the company , which unveiled a suite of new e-readers and tablets at a press conference in @entity16 on thursday , says 27 of the top 100 kindle books were created using a system called @entity19			1
that system allows authors to bypass traditional publishers and instead deal directly with @entity3 , which claims to be able to publish their books digitally " in hours			1
" the authors receive 70 % of the royalties from the sale of these books			1
and some of them are doing quite well			0
" most of my months are six - figure months , " said @entity28 , a 37 - year - old @entity29 author whose " wool " series of digital books was highlighted by @entity3			1
" it 's more than i ever hoped to make in a year			0
" the company says some authors , including @entity37 , who appeared in a promotional video during the @entity3 event , have sold hundreds of thousands of books			1
during the event @entity3 ceo @entity41 displayed a quote from @entity43 , author of best - selling novel " the help , " in which she lamented being rejected dozens of times before a publisher accepted her			1
" what if i had given up at 15 ? or 40 ? or even 60 ? " she was quoted as saying			0
" the thing that occurs to me , " @entity55 said , according to a live blog , " is how many authors did stop after 40 rejections ? how many great manuscripts are sitting in a drawer somewhere ? " the fact that so many self - published books have been successful in @entity3 's ecosystem highlights what other writers say is a trend toward success in digital self - publishing , which is offered also by companies like @entity68 and @entity69 , in addition to @entity3			1
this comes despite evidence that many self - published e-book authors make very little money			1
a 1,007 - person survey earlier this year found " diy authors " make $ 10,000 a year on average , and half of them make less than $ 500 a year , according to a report in @entity79			2
still , the system does work for some			2
" fact is that authors no longer need a publisher , " @entity82 wrote at @entity83			0
" and more and more writers are awakening to the realization that if you are not a high - profile author who can command large sales , a traditional publisher will do little for you beyond editing and printing your book			2
" for @entity28 , author of the " wool " series , the direct - publishing platform has opened up a life he never imagined was possible -- one where he is paid to write full - time			2
without the @entity3 platform , the books might not have been published at all			1
@entity28 never promoted the first edition of " wool , " a dystopian series about a group of underground people who get all of their information about the outside world through a single , digital screen			0
he did n't think it would sell			0
then in october 2011 , he said , his sales jumped from from dozens to thousands			0
" i was taking screenshots and posting them on @entity118 , " he said of the moment when the books started appearing on @entity3 's top - 100 lists			1
( the compilation " @entity120 " is currently ranked no. 193 in the @entity122 store , although it was listed in @entity3 's press conference as being in the top 100 , where it has appeared before )			1
" i was kind of bewildered by the whole thing			0
" @entity28 used to work as a bookseller and yacht captain			0
now his story has been optioned by the director @entity130 , according to news reports			0
@entity133 publishers have approached him about book deals , he said , but he wants to continue to self - publish so he maintains rights to his work			0
" the stigma is gone , " he said of self - publishing in digital formats			0
" publishers will pick up a self - published work if it does well			2
readers are really just interested in good stories			0

@entity3 : 27 of 100 top @entity122 books are self - published
one such author says he makes six figures per month
the @entity19 system gives authors 70 % royalties
@entity3 on thursday released new line of e-readers and tablets
