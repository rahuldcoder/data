-- @entity1 was far from just a fashion designer			1
the man who died monday at the age of 82 was as much an icon as some of the celebrities he dressed over the years			2
from haute couture to causal wear , his name became synonymous with glamour and style			1
after he spent decades making the beautiful all the more so , he became a part of the zeitgeist			2
the following are five examples of the designer 's influence on pop culture			1
on the small screen fans of " @entity20 " often tuned in as much for the style lessons as for the spicy plotlines			2
@entity24 's @entity23 helped put @entity26 shoes on the map and had viewers trying to emulate some of her looks			2
devotees can quote from season six when @entity32 's artist boyfriend , @entity31 ( @entity33 ) , casually mentions his friendship with @entity1			1
" @entity35 ? you ... you call him @entity35 ? " @entity23 asks @entity31 , stunned			0
he later gifts her with an @entity1 dress , scoring points with us all			1
@entity42 wore one of the designer 's gowns at this year 's @entity46			2
it was literally a signature piece , as she had @entity1 's @entity49 etched on the back			1
" i said to mr. @entity1 , please let me use scarlet embroidery thread and splash your name across the back , " the actress told @entity52			1
" it was my idea			0
he would never in a million years have done it ; he 's far too modest			0
in the music industry hip - hop often finds rappers waxing about luxury			0
so it 's no surprise that more than a few incorporated the designer into their lyrics			2
whether it 's @entity70 musing about being " front row at @entity1 " or @entity77 's clever word play -- " especially if she ca n't get that dress from @entity1 they would n't rent her " -- many artists used his name to express the good life			1
@entity82 family remembers @entity1 3			1
with the movers and shakers his fashions were a favorite of this country 's first ladies from @entity90 to @entity91 , and he continued to draw the rich and powerful even in his later years			0
celebs like @entity94 and @entity95 were often spotted at his shows , and some , like @entity97 , clamored to be photographed with the man who dressed them so elegantly			0
" so sad for the loss of this legend			0
@entity1 thank for all the beauty and inspiration you shared with us , " " @entity103 " judge @entity102 tweeted			1
at the movies who can forget the scene in " @entity111 " in which @entity112 as fashion editor @entity113 explains to her assistant @entity114 ( played by @entity115 ) how high fashion filters down to the masses -- including the blue sweater she is wearing			0
" you 're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002 , @entity1 did a collection of cerulean gowns , " the tough - as - nails @entity113 says			1
" and then i think it was @entity125 , was n't it , who showed cerulean military jackets ? and then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers			0
then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic @entity132 where you , no doubt , fished it out of some clearance bin			0
among the people his jeans were hot in the 1980s , and his brand encompasses everything from fragrance to sleepwear			0
though his name often showed up in the media for designing @entity147 's wedding gown or dressing stars on the red carpet , @entity1 's style was also available to the much less famous			1
for that , we 'll all remember him .			0
