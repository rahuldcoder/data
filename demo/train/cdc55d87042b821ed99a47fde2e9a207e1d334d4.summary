@entity0 -- despite sweeping reform of food safety laws intended to make what we eat less dangerous , the number of @entity3 falling ill or dying from contaminated food has increased 44 % since last year , according to a report released wednesday			1
tainted cantaloupe , unsafe mangoes , meat and the recent peanut butter recall -- which so far has infected 25 people , mostly children , in 19 states -- has left consumers struggling to keep up with the dizzying list of ever - changing toxic edibles			1
approximately 48 million people get sick from eating tainted food each year , the report 's authors , the @entity3 @entity19 said , arguing more must be done to protect @entity3 from unsafe food			1
the report says there were 718 illnesses directly linked to food recalls in 2011			1
there were 1,035 illnesses from january to september 2012 -- an increase of 44 %			1
multistate beef recall tied to potential e. coli contamination two years ago , president @entity34 signed into law the @entity36 , a vast piece of legislation giving the @entity39 , among other things , more power to be proactive holding food suppliers responsible for foodborne illness outbreaks			1
but while some parts of the law have been enacted , the vast majority of the law 's regulatory framework remains in limbo , sitting in the @entity50 , with no clear timetable for implementation			2
when asked about the delays , @entity50 spokeswoman @entity53 told @entity1 , " we have taken key steps , including putting out a food safety rule cracking down on salmonella in eggs and expanding e. coli testing for beef			2
we are working as expeditiously as possible to implement the food safety legislation we fought so hard for			2
when it comes to rules with this degree of importance and complexity , it is critical that we get it right			0
" the report also takes issue with the delayed response and plans in @entity73 to cut @entity39 funding			2
" in february , the president 's budget requested $ 4.5 billion for the @entity39			0
but budget proposals in both the @entity78 and the @entity80 fall below this target , coming in $ 600 ( million ) to $ 700 million below full funding , which the @entity50 has called ' harmful ' to food safety regulations , " the @entity19 says			1
@entity84 's recalls mini-wheats the group 's report also says the @entity39 has n't been able to keep up with increased demands for inspection of imported foods			2
nearly 15 % of food consumed in the @entity3 is imported , and the @entity39 's own data indicates two - thirds of the fruits and vegetables on @entity3 's dinner plates are from foreign food suppliers			1
yet in 2008 the @entity39 inspected only 153 of roughly 189,000 registered foreign food facilities			0
@entity100 , nut butter recall expanded instead of improving , the problem of foodborne outbreaks is getting worse , the report says			1
" when comparing 2010 infection incidences with national health objective targets ... the only incidence rate that meets the target goal was the incidence of infection with @entity111 , " the report says			0
" the incidence of salmonella was three times the 2010 national health objective target , which is especially alarming , as salmonella causes the majority of hospitalizations and deaths from foodborne disease			0
" the report argues the @entity39 needs to be provided with funding , develop concrete and specific standards for inspection at all facilities , perform more unannounced inspections , coordinate with other agencies such as the @entity128 , and put more resources toward monitoring the causes of foodborne illness			0
popcorn recalled due to possible @entity134 contamination for its part , the @entity39 told @entity1 , " the rule - making process can take time , and we are working diligently to get this right			0
we are confident the end result will be a solid framework to strengthen and modernize our nation 's food safety system			0
" the @entity19 's report joins a growing chorus of food safety advocates demanding increased scrutiny of the @entity3 food supply and those calling for complete implementation of the @entity36			1
the group helped design the framework for the @entity153 , the federal agency created to regulate the banking industry 's consumer marketing tactics			0
whether wednesday 's scathing report will lead to similar results remains to be seen			0
recall round - up : moonpies , cookies and imported cheese			0
