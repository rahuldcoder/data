-- fifteen - year - old @entity1 got drunk at a party and passed out			0
what happened next , according to her family , was that she was sexually assaulted by multiple young men , who took photos and circulated them in their high school of more than 1,000 students			1
not long afterward , @entity1 , devastated and hopeless , committed suicide			0
in @entity11 , @entity12 , then 15 , was sexually assaulted by multiple perpetrators , according to her family , and photographs were also posted online for the world to see			2
she was tormented and bullied for more than a year with no legal action taken by the authorities , who stated there was " insufficient evidence " to file charges			0
why did these tragedies happen ? the rate of sexual assaults is alarmingly high among adolescents			1
research from the @entity29 and the @entity30 finds that 30 % to 35 % of female sexual assault survivors were first raped between the ages of 11 to 17			1
many of these assaults occur when victims are under the influence of alcohol , and a surprising number of adolescent rapes involve multiple perpetrators			1
a recent study found that 12.4 % of sexual assaults committed against 13 - to 17 - year - old teens were gang rapes			1
when evidence goes viral rape is a crime of power and dominance , and social media provide new ways of asserting that power to hurt victims over and over again			1
gang rape takes on a whole new meaning when images and slurs are posted and forwarded and spread endlessly			2
adolescent sexual assaults are particularly likely to go viral ( more so than instances of adult rape ) because of the " everyone knows everything about everyone " culture of middle and high school			1
the ubiquity of cell phones with cameras and the power of the @entity70 make for faster , farther - reaching gossip , name - calling , character assassination and ultimately despair for the victim			1
what was once a horrible incident that the victim remembers and suffers in private agony has now become an all - you - can - watch public humiliation event			0
there 's ample evidence that bullying has grown widespread , but the crime of rape has always been around			2
we live in a culture in which victims are blamed for the assault and made to feel like they are the ones who are criminal and dirty and shameful			1
many rape victims are afraid to report the assault to police because they believe the criminal system will not help them			1
a recent @entity30 study found that among adolescent sexual assault victims who did the brave the system -- they filed a police report , they met with investigators , they endured a medical forensic exam and rape kit -- 60 % of these cases were not prosecuted by the criminal justice system			1
these rates are even worse for adult victims : on average , 86 % of sexual assaults that are reported to the police are never passed along to prosecutors even to be considered for prosecution			1
that 's 86 % that go nowhere			0
the cases were n't forwarded to prosecutors because police said there was " insufficient evidence , " or because they thought the victim was " making a false report , " or because the victim " was n't credible " -- despite the fact that all of these victims had a sexual assault medical forensic exam and forensic evidence collection kit ( " rape kit " )			1
these cases were closed with either no investigation at all , or minimal investigational effort			0
a recent report from @entity134 suggests this is an alarmingly common practice			2
when the criminal justice system does n't listen , does n't investigate , does n't seem to care , it sends the message to rapists : you will not be held accountable for your crimes			1
perhaps it is not surprising that several studies have found most rapists are serial rapists			0
to victims , this inaction sends the message : your suffering is not our concern			2
@entity12 's case went nowhere			0
only now , after her death , will it be reopened			0
how can this be changed ? one , reform the criminal justice system			1
train legal personnel on best practices for the investigation and prosecution of these crimes			0
challenge law enforcement agencies to start by believing and to investigate , not shelve , these crimes			0
demand that police see these images on social media for what they are : not pornographic exploits but evidence of a crime			1
two , we must get survivors to the services that can help them			0
the despair that victims experience can all too quickly consume them and destroy their lives			2
the federal @entity174 and the @entity175 provide funding to all states and territories for rape crisis hotlines , crisis counseling and victim advocacy programs			2
these services are provided free of charge			0
friends , family , teachers , everyone can help let survivors know that help is available			0
and finally , we have to do more to prevent cyberbullying			1
the important truth not to lose sight of is that most teens do not commit sexual assaults and most do not bully			1
we need to support and empower these youth to speak out and intervene with their peers			0
the @entity29 has resources for schools and communities to develop " bystander prevention programs , " which teach effective strategies youth can use to prevent violence among their peers			2
widespread adoption of these programs is critical			0
for girls such as @entity212 , @entity12 and many untold others , their agony had become too much , and the only solution they saw was suicide			0
we will never again hear their words , their stories , their voices			0
but our voices can still be heard , and we must demand solutions to this seemingly intractable problem			0
we owe all victims justice and compassion			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2
