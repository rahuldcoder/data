@entity1 , @entity0 -- it started with verbal abuse , and then -- perhaps inevitably -- it got physically , terrifyingly violent			1
supporters of @entity0 's president @entity6 flooded into @entity1 's @entity7 wednesday after the president 's opponents dominated the scene for more than a week			1
separated at first by barriers , the rival demonstrators exchanged insults , then began throwing anything they could find at each other , including shoes , rocks and sticks			1
suddenly the barriers came down			1
people surged toward each other in a chaotic scene that conjured images of a revolution			1
others stumbled through the crowd			1
blood streamed down the faces of the wounded			1
a few women away from the front line gave the injured water and swabbed at their wounds			1
many of the injuries were serious , even though demonstrators wrapped sweatshirts and other clothes around their heads to protect themselves from flying stones			1
dozens of wounded were carried away , bleeding from gashes			2
it was impossible to tell from visits to a makeshift clinic which side was faring worse , @entity2 's @entity43 said			1
he said simply : " they are all @entity0			2
" a mosque served as a makeshift field hospital , staffed by volunteer doctors , he said			1
the day was spotted with scenes of brutality			2
at one point , bloodied men from the pro-regime side were dragged toward the center of @entity7 by anti-government demonstrators who beat and kicked them along the way			1
one man ripped out the hair of one of the captives			2
police were nowhere to be seen			2
@entity66 tanks surrounded the square , but the military proved unable or unwilling to separate the two sides			2
the hatches on their tanks and armored personnel carriers remained closed			2
some brave @entity0 tried to stop the violence , putting their bodies between the sides			2
briefly they seemed to succeed			2
there was a lull in the violence			2
some protesters from the rival camps embraced			0
all at once , about 50 or 60 people carrying clubs and riding horses and camels charged into the square , beating some protesters			1
at least one man was pulled off his horse and beaten			0
people tore paving stones out of the streets with crowbars and their bare hands , filling bags with rocks to use as an arsenal in the street battle			1
some ripped street signs out of the ground , using the metal as makeshift shields			1
@entity2 's @entity103 was threatened by a @entity105 supporter who told her to get out of the area			0
" i was a little bit fearful , " she said			0
another protester stepped in and protected her , telling the first not to touch her because " she is with me			0
" she said she ran as fast as she could back to her colleagues			0
" i 'm fine , but i 've got to say , this is a situation that can turn on a dime			0
there is a lot of anger coming from those protesters			0
" they are attacking journalists , she said , and will threaten anyone who looks @entity121			0
it was unclear whether there was shooting on the square			0
@entity2 's @entity125 and @entity126 said they heard shots being fired , although @entity126 suggested it may have been troops on the sidelines shooting into the air to try to restore order			0
the interior ministry denied there was shooting			0
@entity2 's @entity137 , overlooking the square from a hotel , did not hear any gunfire , he said , calling that " a blessing			0
" and somehow , amid the clashes , pockets of peace remained -- including around small groups who , amid the violence , dropped to their knees and faced @entity147			0
the time had come for daily prayers			0
but the battle continued for hours , with regime supporters blocking exits from the square as soldiers largely remained on the sidelines			0
a group of women sat weeping , terrified by the violence they had seen			0
as night fell , @entity105 forces began throwing @entity163 cocktails , and with the sun going down , flames rose from the square			1
the army deployed hoses from the sidelines of the square , spraying water over the heads of the demonstrators onto the fires			1
the troops may be able to extinguish the physical fires			1
whether they will be able to put out the metaphorical ones sweeping the city -- if they even want to -- remains to be seen			0
@entity2 's @entity179 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
