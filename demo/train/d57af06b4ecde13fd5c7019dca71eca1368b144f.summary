-- the man leading the hunt for @entity3 says the search is the most difficult in human history , but modern technology greatly increases the chances of finding the missing plane			1
the four underwater signals that search teams detected are still " the most promising lead " investigators have in the search for the @entity15 , @entity9 told @entity0 's @entity16 on monday			1
but are they all pings from the plane 's data recorders ? a @entity22 report monday said authorities increasingly believe only the first two signals detected are relevant to the search			1
and a @entity27 source told @entity0 that @entity27 officials assisting in the search are sharing the signal data with @entity32 agencies and consultants for " re-analysis , " adding that searchers have more confidence in the first two pings detected			0
@entity9 told @entity0 it 's still too soon to rule out any of the signals			1
" analysis on all four detections is continuing , " he said			2
" at this point in time , it is too early to discount any of the acoustic detections			0
" the pings have played a key role in shaping the search for the plane , which went missing march 8 during a flight from @entity49 to @entity50 with 239 people onboard			2
@entity9 told @entity0 the hunt for the plane is even more difficult than that for @entity55 , which disappeared in the @entity56 in 2009			1
" the big difference between @entity55 and @entity3 is that the last known position , in terms of @entity3 , is at the top of the @entity61 , and then the aircraft continued to fly for an extended period after that , " @entity9 told @entity0 's @entity16 on monday			1
" whereas @entity66 , they had a very good last known position , which then turned out to be very close to where the aircraft was eventually found			0
" but he said searchers are performing " groundbreaking work " with satellite analysis , which has helped isolate the search area in the @entity74			1
" without that , we would be essentially searching the whole of the @entity74 , and i think the chances of finding the aircraft in those circumstances would have been slim , " @entity9 said			2
" i think by having this defined search area ... i think eventually we will find the aircraft			0
" @entity9 is the chief search coordinator for the @entity84 , based in @entity85			2
he said his greatest concern throughout the two - month search has been the families of those on board			0
" to have a set of circumstances where you do n't know what 's happened to your loved ones in circumstances such as this , it 's just a terrible , terrible emotional trauma of all of those involved , " he said			0
" and beyond that , the wider public has a great interest in what happened here because we all fly in airplanes , and we all fly long distances over water , and a lot of people want to know what happened and why it happened			0
" @entity116 for @entity3 gets deeper , broader , pricier about criticism of @entity118 since the plane disappeared on march 8 with 239 people on board , the @entity118 government has been criticized for its response and accusations that it has not been transparent			1
@entity9 said he believes @entity118 has been forthcoming			1
" i think some of the commentary about what the @entity118 have done , i do n't think is as fair and objective as it might have been , " @entity9 said			1
" people are looking for answers , and there are no answers at the moment			0
" ' it just disappeared ' @entity9 said he understands why many families are frustrated by the lack of information			2
" initially , the aircraft -- well , simply put , it just disappeared			0
and i guess in this day and age , that surprised a lot of people , " he said			0
but such a disappearance is quite possible if the transponder or anything on the aircraft that transmits signals is turned off			0
" i think that 's something that we , as a world community , have to correct as soon as possible , " @entity9 said			2
" we need to have jetliners that are equipped with some sort of tracking device that ca n't be turned off , that can be tracked all of the time			0
and with satellite technology available , i think that can be done in the near future			0
" on the same day that @entity9 spoke , a satellite communications company said it would begin providing a free global airline tracking service			1
@entity163 , the company whose satellite had the last known contact with flight 370 , said it proposed the service to the @entity169 ahead of the @entity169 's conference on aircraft tracking this week			1
" this service is being offered to all 11,000 commercial passenger aircraft , which are already equipped with an @entity163 satellite connection , " the company said in a statement			1
it said the tracking would cover " virtually 100 % of the world 's long haul commercial fleet			2
" @entity0 's @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity9 says underwater signals remain " the most promising lead "
" groundbreaking work " with satellite analysis will help find the plane , he says
@entity9 *defends* @entity118 's response to the missing plane
@entity163 offers free global airline tracking to all 11,000 commercial passenger planes
