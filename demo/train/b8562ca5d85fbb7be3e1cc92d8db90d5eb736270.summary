@entity0 -- the @entity2 passed a bill tuesday that would extend funding for the federal government by another two weeks -- through march 18 -- while cutting $ 4 billion from current spending levels			1
the measure was approved in a 335 - 91 vote , with republicans overwhelmingly backing it while @entity11 were sharply divided			0
the @entity12 plans to vote on the measure on wednesday			1
senators and aides from both parties said they expected it to pass and proceed to president @entity18 for his signature to prevent a government shutdown after friday , when the current spending resolution expires at midnight			1
also tuesday , the @entity12 approved a measure that would halt paychecks for the president and @entity25 in the event of a government shutdown			1
it was unclear when the @entity2 would take up the measure			2
while the bill extending government funding for two weeks was expected to clear the @entity32 - controlled @entity2 , some @entity11 have indicated a preference for a month - long extension while legislators negotiate a more comprehensive spending plan for the rest of the fiscal year , which ends on september 30			1
the @entity39 has voiced concern that the passage of a series of short - term funding bills could create a climate of uncertainty and hamper prospects for a stronger economic recovery			0
president @entity18 called house speaker @entity48 before tuesday 's vote to discuss the measure , according to @entity39 press secretary @entity51			1
@entity51 indicated the administration would be willing to back a package cutting up to $ 8 billion from current spending levels over a period lasting up to five weeks			1
the cuts , he told reporters , would be credited toward further decreases in a future comprehensive spending plan covering the remainder of the fiscal year			2
@entity48 , an @entity61 @entity32 , brushed aside questions about a longer extension , telling reporters that @entity11 should have approached him earlier about that possibility			2
" i think we 're taking the responsible path forward , " @entity48 said			2
" the @entity69 people want us to get our fiscal house in order , and this is a step in the right direction			0
" the last @entity74 @entity25 went on a " spending spree , " declared @entity77 representative @entity76 , the @entity32 chairman of the @entity78			1
now " we 're trying to slow down and stop " it			0
@entity11 have repeatedly argued @entity32 are exacerbating the budget crunch by refusing to allow an expiration of the @entity83 - era tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity69			0
@entity25 should use the two weeks provided by the bill for a " reality check , " said @entity2 minority leader @entity86 , @entity87			1
" i just want to know where everyone was when the deficit grew in the eight years of the @entity83 administration			0
" even if the two - week funding measure passes @entity25 and is signed into law , the @entity39 and congressional @entity32 will remain in a bitter standoff over how best to fund the government for the rest of the current fiscal year			1
the @entity2 recently passed a measure that would cut $ 61 billion in funding for the rest of the year , largely by imposing cuts in domestic discretionary spending that @entity11 insist are too severe , and @entity18 has threatened to veto it			1
at the same time , some conservative republicans have pushed for a larger package of cuts totalling $ 100 billion from current spending levels			1
@entity11 have highlighted a report from @entity109 's chief economist @entity108 , which concludes that the proposed @entity32 cuts would result in the loss of 700,000 jobs by the end of next year			0
republicans , in turn , are trumpeting a new @entity117 report showing that billions of additional dollars could be saved by eliminating needless program duplication and overlap			0
@entity18 told a group of governors at the @entity39 on monday that he is " committed to funding only those things that work			2
" but the domestic discretionary spending being targeted by the @entity32 , he noted , accounts for only 12 % of the entire budget			0
new spending is required on priorities such as infrastructure modernization , he said			0
the country " ca n't afford to kick the can down the road any longer " on festering fiscal problems relating to entitlement programs such as @entity134 and @entity135 , the president warned			0
neither party has put forward a detailed proposal dealing with exploding entitlement costs			0
@entity140 , vice president for policy and a co-founder of @entity143 , a centrist @entity74 think tank , told @entity1 he expects " there will be a greater level of cooperation than expected and a major deficit reduction plan involving entitlement spending sometime this year			2
" by contrast , longtime political observer @entity149 thinks there could be one or two short shutdowns this year			0
" you get two weeks by going for $ 4 billion in ( easy ) cuts			1
what do you go for now ? " said @entity149			0
@entity149 , a resident scholar at the conservative @entity156 , predicted it would be hard for @entity11 and @entity2 @entity32 to agree on specific cuts anywhere near the magnitude of what the @entity32 wants			1
any compromise , he noted , will be a hard sell for the 87 freshman conservatives in the @entity2 who would see a deal as a far cry from what they believe they were elected to do last november			2
@entity1 's @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report			0
