but the thoughts of the drivers were with @entity22 , a reserve driver for @entity23 until a horror crash in testing a year ago curtailed her @entity26 ambitions			1
@entity12 struggled to 10th best after a spin in his @entity29 , but then paid tribute to his fellow @entity31 @entity22			1
" i still ca n't believe it and need a while to stop and think about it , " he told the official @entity26 website			2
" of course , it 's very sad news for the world of motorsport as @entity8 was loved by everyone			0
now , all we can do is pray for her and for her family			0
" @entity43 , ninth best for @entity44 spoke for many : " today 's news about @entity8 is horrendous and tragic			0
" this is a real shock to the whole @entity26 ' family ' and the world of motorsport			2
my thoughts are with her family at this time			0
" @entity1 , who has won the last four @entity3 races to open up 77 point lead over @entity12 , cautioned against placing too much emphasis on friday practice			1
" it 's good to see we are up there today , but it 's not always so important , " the @entity56 said			0
" we need to step up our game for tomorrow , as @entity61 will be strong in qualifying			0
" @entity63 in a @entity61 was the closest challenger to the @entity64 with the third fastest time with teammate @entity65 back in sixth			2
@entity65 had been quickest in morning practice ahead of @entity63			0
separating them in the afternoon were the @entity69 duo of @entity70 and @entity71 , with the former also ending in the gravel after a spin on @entity75 of a testing circuit			0
saturday will see the third practice session ahead of final qualifying			2
