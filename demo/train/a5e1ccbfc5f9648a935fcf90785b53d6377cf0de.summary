@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 prosecutor @entity4 wants the @entity1 track star sent for independent psychiatric evaluation , he said monday , in a move that could delay the athlete 's murder trial for a month or more			1
a psychiatrist testified monday that @entity5 has an anxiety disorder stemming from his double amputation as an infant and his unstable parents			1
he 's depressed now and feeling guilt from having killed his girlfriend , @entity18 , defense witness dr. @entity16 said on the stand			1
@entity4 responded by comparing the athlete 's mental state to post-traumatic stress disorder and saying the law required psychiatric observation			1
the prosecutor 's extremely unusual move is essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or " capacity " defense even though the athlete 's legal team is not mounting one , @entity2 legal analyst @entity25 said			2
@entity25 , a criminologist and law lecturer at the @entity37 , said she had never seen this done before			0
@entity5 ' lead defense lawyer , @entity39 , is fighting back , saying @entity4 is oversimplifying the law			1
the question was left unresolved when court adjourned for the day			0
@entity4 is due to submit his application on tuesday after both sides have finished questioning @entity16			1
the psychiatrist took the stand monday morning for the defense , going all the way back to when the disabled sprinter was 11 months old			0
@entity5 would have experienced the amputation of both of his legs below the knee at that time as a " traumatic assault " because he was too young to speak or understand what was happening to him , she said in court			1
his parents then put pressure on him to appear normal , and his mother abused alcohol at times after she and @entity5 ' father divorced , she said			1
she raised him and his siblings " to see their external environment as threatening " and " added to the anxiety , " @entity16 said			0
@entity5 earlier testified that " everything i learnt in life , i learned from her			1
" reasonable ? the defense is trying to show that @entity5 made a genuine and reasonable mistake and responded reasonably on the night he killed @entity18 , 29 , a model and law school graduate			1
@entity5 , 27 , admits that he fired four bullets through a closed door in his house , killing @entity18 , but says he thought he was protecting himself from a burglar			2
whether the judge believes he acted reasonably could mean the difference between a verdict of culpable homicide , a lesser charge than murder , and an acquittal , according to @entity25			0
if @entity5 is convicted of murder , he faces at least 15 years in prison , and possibly life			2
@entity1 does not have the death penalty			0
a verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at the discretion of judge @entity91			0
@entity16 said the athlete 's general anxiety disorder meant he felt that his safety was threatened even when objectively it was not , she said			1
and she said he was " devastated that he killed his girlfriend			0
" @entity18 's mother , who has been in court for most of the trial , was not there monday to hear the evaluation			0
fight or flight @entity16 also addressed the question of why @entity5 took his gun and went toward the sound of what the thought was danger rather than trying to get away			2
because of his disability , she said , when he faces a fight - or - flight situation , he can not flee , so his instinct is to fight			0
@entity4 then pressed the psychiatrist on whether @entity5 was mentally ill and whether he could distinguish right from wrong			1
many people have general anxiety disorder , and it does not imply that one has lost touch with reality , she said			1
the psychiatrist took the stand on day 30 of a high - profile trial that has gripped @entity1 and much of the world			0
she could be the last witness			0
@entity39 said last week that he expected to wrap up his case tuesday			0
new psychiatric evaluation could push the end of the trial a month or more away			0
when the defense is done presenting its evidence , both sides will make closing arguments , and then @entity91 will retire to consider her verdict			0
@entity1 does not have jury trials , but she is being assisted by two experts called assessors			0
@entity4 has fought aggressively to show that @entity5 argued with @entity18 before killing her			1
the trial has seen @entity5 break down repeatedly , crying , wailing and sometimes throwing up as the court sees and hears evidence about @entity18 's death			2
@entity140 said the athlete 's physical distress was real			0
he listened with his head lowered as the psychiatrist testified monday			1
earlier evidence has included graphic photos of the wounds ; testimony from neighbors , friends , police and pathologists ; and the actual door through which @entity5 fired four hollow - tipped bullets on the fateful night			1
argument or error ? there is no dispute that @entity5 shot and killed @entity18 in his home early on the morning of @entity160 2013			2
@entity4 tore into @entity5 over five days in court in april , saying the @entity163 medalist had argued with @entity18 and killed her on purpose			1
he tried to force @entity165 to look at a picture of @entity18 's head after the shooting , accused @entity165 of being selfish and possessive , and said he refused to take responsibility for his actions			0
the defense team is seeking to cast doubt on the state 's case and needs only to show there is a reasonable doubt that @entity5 meant to kill @entity18			2
@entity91 must decide whether @entity5 genuinely made a terrible mistake or whether he murdered @entity18 intentionally			2
live blog : @entity5 on trial @entity5 is arguably the world 's most famous disabled athlete , known as the " @entity5 " for the carbon - fiber blades he runs on			2
he fought for -- and won -- the right to compete against able - bodied runners at the @entity184 after his @entity163 success			0
