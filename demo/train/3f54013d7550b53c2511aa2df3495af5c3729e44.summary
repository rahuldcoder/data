@entity0 , @entity1 -- forces loyal to @entity4 have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western @entity1 , one of the @entity1 leader 's former generals said friday			1
the attack began at dawn thursday , the former commander said			1
he now commands rebels in @entity0 , using the name @entity16			1
the attack began thursday when about 150 of @entity4 's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near @entity0 , he said			1
they were supported by about 40 vehicles , including long - range " grad " rocket launchers and 14.5 mm heavy machine guns with a range of 6 kilometers			2
@entity0 lies about 90 miles southwest of the capital , @entity27			1
@entity0 , population 40,000 , is at the eastern tip of a 170 - mile ribbon of rebel - held mountains that stretch westward from the @entity33 border			1
after decades in the @entity1 army , including a tour of duty in neighboring @entity36 , hajj @entity16 said he now despises his former commander in chief , whom he called a terrorist			1
" he 's never used infantry like this , " said the trim , gray - bearded rebel commander			2
in previous battles , hajj @entity16 said , @entity4 's artillery forces had taken over nearby civilian housing in @entity46 and shelled from a distance			0
@entity4 's forces simultaneously attacked thursday on three fronts , hajj @entity16 said -- to the north of @entity0 , firing @entity51 into the eastern part of the nearby town of @entity54 , and attacking to the southeast and to the east of @entity0			1
in response , he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off @entity4 's advance , hajj @entity16 said			0
as of friday night , one rebel was dead and three were wounded , one of them critically , he said			2
fresh trenches cut deep in the stark , red sand here underscore the rebels ' readiness to continue defending the town			0
the absence of @entity4 's forces has buoyed the confidence of the rebel fighters			0
some of the fighters who returned late friday from the front lines -- crammed into the backs of pickup trucks -- appeared to be school - age			1
they carried only a handful of weapons , a few hunting rifles and old , bolt - action shotguns			2
nevertheless , hajj @entity82 said , " they are keen and determined to fight for their freedom			0
" the attack that began thursday , he speculated , was intended to regain control of @entity54 , population 12,000			1
residents east of the town had " declared their support for the rebels a month ago , " he said , while the rest of the town remains loyal to @entity4 and his former head of internal security , @entity98			0
hajj @entity16 said @entity99 lives there			0
since the raids began , hajj @entity16 said , he has lost contact with rebels in @entity54 with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to @entity0 after his house was destroyed in the shelling			1
as dusk fell friday the shelling visible earlier from the roofs of @entity0 abated			1
but shortly before 10 p.m. , the attack resumed with sporadic barrages of gunfire			2
the rebels said the night shelling may have been intended to terrorize @entity0 's residents so they would flee			1
some have , but most were staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over , hajj @entity16 said			0
early friday , @entity120 jets pounded @entity1 ports , destroying eight of @entity4 's warships , an alliance spokesman said			1
@entity120 targeted the ships in @entity27 , @entity125 and @entity126 after it was apparent that @entity4 's forces were increasingly using naval vessels to launch attacks on civilians , said @entity131 , @entity120 's military spokesman			2
@entity4 was indiscriminately mining waters in @entity133 and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , @entity131 said			0
" he was using maritime forces to lay mines			0
these were legal targets , " @entity131 said at a briefing in @entity139 , @entity140			0
he did not say whether crew members were aboard when the ships were hit			0
the @entity120 campaign is progressing and @entity4 's combat power had been severely curtailed , @entity131 said			0
but the @entity1 leader 's forces continued their heavy shelling of @entity149 , on the @entity33 border , where thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks			1
the border crossing , through which humanitarian aid is often trucked in , was closed friday			0
along the southern borders , rebels had gained control of border crossings between @entity1 and @entity158 and @entity1 and @entity36 and had regained control of @entity160 in the southeast , according to a report by the @entity163 , which has teams in @entity1 and @entity33			1
the global medical organization said rebel control along the @entity36 border was significant because supplies flow through there to @entity4 's forces			0
" while control of the entire border will be difficult , the rebels are reported to have a large force in the region , " it said			0
" the @entity178 and @entity179 border crossings remain under @entity4 control			0
" meanwhile , the @entity181 announced it will hold a two - day meeting of heads of state in the @entity185 capital of @entity186 next week to address the conflict in @entity1 , as well as other security issues in @entity189			1
in another development , the family of @entity192 freelance photojournalist @entity191 , who has been missing in @entity1 since april , said late thursday they believe he was killed by @entity1 government forces			1
the statement was posted on the " free photographer @entity191 " @entity198 page and followed interviews given in the @entity200 , @entity201 and the @entity202 by two journalists who said they were with him when he was shot			0
" on 5 april 2011 , @entity191 was shot by @entity4 's forces in an extremely remote location in the @entity1 desert			2
according to eyewitnesses , his injuries were such that he could not have survived without medical attention , " according to the @entity198 statement			0
@entity191 was last reportedly seen in a remote region of the @entity1 desert			2
he was reportedly captured by @entity4 's forces near the town of @entity215 , a key oil town in eastern @entity1 , that has been the site of intense fighting .			2
