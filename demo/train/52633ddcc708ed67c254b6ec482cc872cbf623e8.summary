@entity0 has spoken to @entity1 previously about the rise of @entity3 , and the challenges facing the @entity6 's new oil minister , @entity7			1
now , @entity9 airstrikes have hit locations in eastern @entity11 where @entity3 has been using mobile refineries to produce oil			1
@entity1 has revisited the conversation to find out the likely impact of the strikes			0
this is @entity18 's analysis of the situation			2
what impact will the @entity9 strikes on oil refineries have on @entity3 ? the impact of these strikes on @entity3 oil refineries are going to be immense and grave			2
if they are hitting the facilities and the oil convoys on the smuggling roads they will significantly disrupt supply and regular production			0
if the bombardments continue it will impact the energy supply and deny @entity3 much - needed fuel for their mobility and the servicing of the communities under their rule -- now around 8 million people between @entity6 and @entity11			1
it makes sense to target the refineries rather than the oil fields , as the crude ca n't be used to drive the tankers			0
the crude can be sold but the refined oil is much more valuable			2
the @entity9 and its allies now need to clamp down on the borders to break the smuggling routes , particularly into @entity52			2
if the @entity3 refineries are completely hit , the group will need to rely on oil being refined in @entity52 via the black market			1
these roads now need to be closely monitored , there needs to be sharing of information and the cross-border networks need to be targeted			0
how much oil does @entity3 control ? @entity3 , in control of a large swathe of eastern @entity11 , is now handling 60 % of the country 's oil assets and producing 50,000 barrels a day			1
this is not full capacity -- pre-conflict , the assets would have produced around 220,000 barrels a day out of the country 's 385,000 , according to @entity73 figures			2
however , isis do control key oil fields including @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
@entity3 also handle at least 25,000 barrels of oil a day in north and mid-west @entity6 , but that is only a small slice of the country 's total production			1
this oil has found its way to the global economy through @entity52 's southern corridor			1
this black - economy zone is known for its oil trades , smuggling antiquities from @entity6 and @entity11 's ancient sites , and funneling thousands of jihadists to both countries			1
many observers see @entity52 turning a blind eye on a zone that is actively contributing to the instability of the @entity100			0
@entity52 has become @entity3 ' safe haven for treating wounded fighters , a gateway for foreign jihadists , and a financial hub that brings @entity3 over $ 3 million a day in oil money			1
what should be done to tackle the black market in oil ? now that @entity3 are involved in trucking oil out of @entity6 , @entity6 @entity110 must better comply with the federal regulations and stop any trucking of oil for export not accounted for by the federal authority			1
there is a risk the oil would be mixed with other smuggled quantities by @entity3 to @entity122 black markets			1
moreover , the @entity9 and the @entity123 must enforce harsh measures on countries not doing enough to close down black markets contributing to transnational terrorism			0
@entity6 has a new oil minister -- how will he help ? this month , @entity7 was appointed as oil minister			1
on his first day , he visited the besieged refinery of @entity132 , which will help build respect for him in the industry			0
the facility has been under siege since @entity3 occupied the city of @entity139 two months ago			0
@entity7 is a senior politician with a background in economics , and his appointment is welcome news to international companies			0
however , as a non-oil veteran his leadership skills have yet to be tested			0
he faces numerous challenges including resolving issues with the @entity149 , restoring the damaged petroleum industry and ramping up production to meet @entity6 's planned target of nine million barrels per day by 2020 , key objectives the government hopes to achieve within the next four years			1
if he succeeds , his name will be immortalized in history as the savior of a united @entity6			0
will he be able to influence the fight against @entity3 ? although the ministry of oil has a few thousand affiliated security forces , their job is not counter-terrorism -- they are not trained to handle such missions			2
this task will be for the @entity6 special forces , intelligence services and the army			0
however , he can help			0
the people of the @entity174 - dominated provinces are hijacked by three issues			0
they are : @entity3 , a lack of reconciliation and an uncertain economic future			0
@entity7 could do more to push @entity3 out of current sunni - controlled provinces by promoting oil projects that offer local jobs and investment opportunities			1
he could strike a deal with local tribes and businessmen to develop plans for the rehabilitation of their provinces , something that would need to be done as part of a wider reconciliation agenda			0
after all , the rise of @entity3 could have been avoided had there been real political conciliation and economic plans in place to resolve the country 's challenges			2
@entity7 can take some comfort from the fact around 90 % of @entity6 's oil production is in the south , and 10 % is in @entity149 - controlled area , so the bulk of @entity6 's super giant production centers are safe			1
but without having the security situation resolved in @entity6 's @entity3 - controlled regions , it will be impossible to resume operations , let alone consider development of the oil and gas upstream sector in conflict zones			1
what 's the backdrop to @entity7 's appointment ? when @entity3 invaded the @entity174 - dominated part of @entity6 , sympathetic @entity174 insurgencies helped them expand into large areas of land , including seven oil fields with a total capacity of 80,000 barrels per day in @entity223 , @entity139 and territories bordering @entity225			1
by the end of june , 20,000 barrels had been reported as smuggled from the field of @entity229 , traded at $ 25 to $ 60 per barrel			0
later on , @entity3 drew on oil in the fields of @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 , pushing @entity3 - controlled oil production to nearly 40,000 barrels per day			2
with the help of local middlemen -- who control the supply chain by extracting oil , trucking it across territory trucking tankers , paying off border checkpoints and handling sales -- the northern part of the @entity249 has become a black - market zone funding transnational terrorism , led by @entity3 and other @entity252 splinter groups			1
oil revenues have contributed to expanding @entity3 recruitment , with the group 's numbers now estimated to be in excess of 30,000 .			2

@entity0 says @entity3 now controls 60 % of @entity11 's oil assets and a slice of @entity6 's
the oil is sold through black market routes , particularly into @entity52
@entity6 appointed a new oil minister this month , who could help crack down on @entity3
@entity18 says the minister can assist by backing big oil projects that create jobs
