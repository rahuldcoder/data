-- technology is not like wine			0
electronics almost never gain value after they 've been sitting around for a while , but some stand the test of time better than others			0
as @entity13 is reportedly readying a third - generation ipad to be unveiled in the next month or so , owners of previous versions of the tablet may be contemplating a way to unload them for cash			1
fortunate for them , the @entity14 can be resold for about half its original price a year or more after it hit the market , according to data from two popular online researchers that was compiled for @entity0			1
on the other hand , @entity25 's @entity24 devices , which analysts say pose the greatest threat to @entity13 's dominance in tablets , have not been as sought after in the secondary market			1
the various @entity24 e-readers generally are worth between 25 % and 33 % of their original price a year after their releases , according to data from electronics @entity38			1
after a year , the @entity24 's value can sink even faster			1
the @entity24 3 , a 2Â½ - year - old product still being sold by @entity25 for $ 139 under the name @entity42 , can be worth far less			1
on the secondary market , the @entity42 is worth about $ 16 , according to data from @entity45 , a firm that researches electronics commerce			2
@entity25 did n't respond to a request for comment on these statistics			0
likewise , an @entity13 spokeswoman declined to comment			2
one might assume that because the @entity14 is more expensive than even the top - of - the - line @entity24 ( $ 499 to the @entity54 's $ 199 ) that @entity13 's tablet is likely to depreciate more quickly			1
but @entity56 , on average , depreciate 22 % faster than @entity14 , @entity38 executive @entity55 wrote in an e-mail			2
how the @entity54 , @entity25 's first touch - screen tablet computer , will fare in the resale market is unclear			0
it is only 4 months old			0
but @entity25 is expected to continue with its strategy of regularly releasing improved models at drastically reduced prices			0
@entity13 typically releases improved models at the same price as their predecessors for phones , tablets , computers and @entity68 , which can help previous versions retain more of their value over time			1
" @entity24 's frequent price drops combined with multiple models now available heavily contribute to its reduced @entity38 value , " @entity55 wrote			1
" similar to what you see in @entity77 phones ( lots of model updates and frequent price drop ) compared to @entity81 ( few models , stable pricing ) , the @entity81 holds about 60 % of its value one year after launch while even the best @entity86 only hold about 40 %			2
" indeed , another firm called @entity88 reported similar resale - value discrepancies for the @entity81 and ones that use the rival @entity92 software from @entity94			0
however , some types of @entity13 gadgets are less wise investments for gear heads who like to resell their wares in exchange for newer models			0
paying an extra $ 100 or $ 200 for double or triple the storage space will never result in a decent payoff later , a decide spokesman said in a statement			0
of course , pouring your money into gadgets may not be exactly the best financial strategy anyway .			0

one year later , an @entity14 is typically worth about half its original retail price , stats say
but the @entity24 is worth one - *quarter* to one - third of its original price , according to data
with @entity13 products , *upgrading* memory does n't retain much value
