-- " @entity1 did worse			0
" " @entity3 's toast			1
" those are the two main things media commentators , from the right and the left , said about @entity7 gov. @entity3 this week			1
together , they expose the carelessness of the way we talk and think about the people who aspire to the presidency			0
start from this point : many on @entity3 's staff are implicated in an abuse of power that inflicted harm upon tens of thousands of people			1
perhaps the governor did n't know that his staffers had gleefully ordered a traffic disruption on the @entity23 last year			2
there is no evidence that he did know			0
on the other hand , these were the people the governor had chosen			2
this was the culture of the office he led			0
opinion : a @entity3 prosecution would be political dynamite the phrase " the buck stops here " -- used by the governor at his news conference last week -- does n't just mean the boss makes the final decision			1
it means the boss accepts blame for things that go wrong , just as he gains credit from things that go right			0
it means that " i did n't know " is not an acceptable excuse			0
but now proceed to this point : almost everybody who seeks the presidency has demons to slay on his or her way to the office			0
the long road to the highest office in the land is a contest not only against political rivals but against the flaws of a candidate 's own character and temperament			1
we all have such flaws			0
in would - be presidents , they tend to be outsized and to carry outsized importance			0
what we are looking for in a president is not a person without such flaws but a person who has struggled with them and overcome them			1
when a politician gets into trouble , as @entity3 has done , pundits suddenly decide that it 's their job to mimic crisis managers			1
they offer advice on what the politician should say , what gestures he should offer , so as to escape blame and deflect criticism			0
opinion : @entity3 's bogus ' stages of grief ' but what matters after an episode like the bridge story is not the show of contrition but the real lessons learned			1
trouble now can even be a politician 's friend , if it jolts him off a path leading to worse trouble later			0
what @entity3 faces in the bridge uproar is not a communications challenge but a personal growth challenge			2
can this combative politician recruit and run a team that understands better what is acceptable in political combat -- and what is not ? at his news conference after the damning bridge e-mails came to light , @entity3 repeatedly denounced the abuse of conduct as contrary to his personal standards			1
can he enforce higher standards in the future ? @entity3 has a style and sensibility that has brought him far as a politician			2
he 's just received a sharp warning that this style and sensibility will take him no further			0
conflict is intrinsic to politics -- but conflict governed by rules , written and unwritten			0
opinion : @entity3 's choice -- be seen as a crook or schnook ? @entity3 's team broke the rules to score revenge against a political opponent			1
would a @entity3 @entity140 govern the country in the same score - settling way ? even people inclined to support @entity3 are now wondering			2
his future will depend on convincing people that he 's learned his lesson and changed his ways , and the best way to convince people that you have learned a lesson is actually to learn that lesson and actually to change your ways			2
at the end of his own career , @entity157 delivered an eloquent self - assessment of his own failure as president : " @entity163 remember others may hate you , but those who hate you do n't win unless you hate them , and then you destroy yourself			1
" unlike @entity157 , @entity3 can benefit from that wisdom at the beginning of a presidential career rather than at its tragic end			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity172 : @entity3 's team broke rules to gain revenge against opponent
he says question for governor is whether he can learn from this episode
running for president is a test of character , @entity172 says ; can @entity3 overcome his flaws ?
@entity189 : *ex-president* @entity157 realized too late that hating his opponents was his *undoing*
