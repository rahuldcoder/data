-- democrats hoping the capture of @entity3 will bring some kind of closure to the @entity7 issue are sorely mistaken			1
in fact , in terms of policy , events surrounding his arrest only highlight the awful legacy of the @entity16 venture -- when @entity17 assisted the rebels and helped remove the dictator from power in 2011			2
@entity21 did not spring up after strongman @entity22 was deposed , captured and killed in 2011 , but instead a tyranny was replaced with an anarchy			1
there were an estimated 1,700 armed groups left fighting for control of the country and it became , in the words of some security analysts , " an arms bazaar			0
" moreover , the attacks upon the @entity34 mission in @entity7 in 2012 , which led to the deaths of four @entity34 citizens , raised questions about the @entity40 administration 's competence and challenged the idea that the war on terror had brought greater security to the @entity34			1
it is doubtful that seizing @entity46 , accused of masterminding the attack , will allay fears			0
the @entity16 government , such as it is , denies that it gave permission to seize @entity46 and is apparently angry that it happened -- as well it might be			0
the incident suggests that a ) the @entity34 retains some form of military presence in @entity16 and b ) it is quite happy to carry out extraordinary rendition with a minimum of good diplomatic manners			2
@entity46 was reportedly carried away to face justice in a naval ship			0
why ? perhaps partly because it 's difficult to find any countries left in the region who might be willing to help with a transfer by air			2
while @entity40 flexes @entity34 's muscles in @entity16 , the @entity34 ' regional sway is in sharp decline from the heady days of his " @entity73 " tour in 2009			1
the @entity75 world is in crisis : @entity80 fights on in @entity81 , @entity78 's path to democracy is proving long and tricky , @entity82 is descending into sectarian conflict			0
and the past few days have witnessed the near farcical prospect of the @entity34 and @entity85 being allied in @entity82			2
it should be noted that the @entity85 turnaround has caused some republicans to make some extraordinary shifts in their own position			0
last year , @entity92 hawk sen. @entity91 of @entity93 wanted to grant the authority to declare war on @entity96			0
now he 's talking solemnly of the need to ally with the @entity85 as the @entity98 once did with @entity99			0
opinion : why @entity34 raid in @entity16 is a sign of hope as for @entity105 , this will be no quick fix for her problems either			1
criticisms of her role in @entity7 while she was secretary of state range from charges that her department engaged in a cover - up to the rather more vague " lack of leadership ; " there is also the cruel insinuation that she just does n't care , based upon a misinterpretation of her question " what difference at this point does it make ? " regarding the killers ' motives			1
@entity123 might have hoped that capturing @entity46 would prove that justice can still be done when it comes to @entity7 , but it 's difficult to see how it would address the essential question of the adequacy of the administration 's response			1
the reason @entity7 is controversial has less to do with how difficult it has been to catch the perpetrators than with lingering suspicions that the administration did not act quickly enough and tried to deflect criticism by blaming the whole thing on a badly made , @entity140 video			2
@entity7 is raw with emotion , as was obvious when @entity142 , the mother of one of the victims , demanded answers through @entity123 via @entity0			0
of course , @entity7 is a deeply personal and specific issue for @entity142			1
but for many @entity34 , particularly those on the right , it goes to the heart of an alleged carelessness in @entity40 's foreign policy			1
he could just as easily be criticized for the thousands of drone attacks he has ordered or the invisible red lines that he drew in @entity81 and then forgot about			0
but those decisions largely affected foreign citizens , whereas @entity7 is a tale of @entity161 heroes being let down by the incompetence of their own side			1
to conservatives , it 's nothing less than a case of martyrdom			0
it could be @entity40 and @entity123 's @entity85 / @entity168 : the scandal that comes to define everything morally murky or simply inept about their time in office .			2

@entity174 : capture of terror suspect does n't blunt @entity7 issue for @entity40
he says it highlights the anarchy left behind after @entity34 helped *unseat* strongman @entity22
he says for many @entity7 is *emblem* of @entity40 's careless foreign policy
@entity174 : if @entity105 thinks @entity7 issue behind her , she does n't get its *political* *saliency*
