-- amid the continuing bloodshed and turmoil in @entity4 , one thing is becoming clear : the @entity7 regime 's propaganda campaign against the opposition is resonating with some countries in the @entity10 and elsewhere			1
the regime has consistently characterized its opponents as " terrorists			0
" and while the once peaceful @entity17 - inspired demonstrations have long morphed into an armed insurrection that includes a wide array of @entity21 groups of varying militancy , some in the international community are allowing their all - consuming fear of " terrorism " prevent them from recognizing an equally dangerous ideology that not long ago engulfed the entire " world " in a war that cost millions of people their lives , and which was responsible for unimaginable atrocities , the full scope of which is still being ascertained today			2
those who have adopted the view that the @entity7 regime 's continuation in power is a " lesser of two evils " should be under no illusions as to what their preferred option is : fascism			1
if history is any indication , once a fascist " mindset " has been inculcated into the support base of a regime , peace seldom follows			1
the quest for vanquishing enemies -- both internal and external -- never ceases			0
the international community 's reluctance to punish @entity4 @entity7 over his obliteration of all norms governing civil wars , should make it consider the strong possibility that it will be compelled to confront him at some point in the near future , when he defies the rules of international relations by launching an unprovoked military attack against a nation on which he blames all @entity4 's troubles			1
the most likely candidate is @entity67			0
while this scenario seems remote for a number of reasons -- logistics and the tattered state of the @entity4 economy and military being the three most obvious -- one should remember that past fascist regimes ' ill - fated military adventures also took others by surprise , as they seemed to defy conventional wisdom on several fronts			1
much like the ideologies that justify terrorism , fascism operates within unique moral parameters and therefore its calculus will always confound those who do not adhere to it			2
a scholar on terrorism recently put it best when he wrote that " sacred values " produce " devoted actors ( as opposed to rational actors ) , who are willing to resort to extreme violence with little regard to risks and rewards or costs and consequences			0
" the same is true of the most militant variants of fascism			0
people who dismiss such a scenario should listen carefully to @entity7 's recent verbal assault against what he calls " wahhabism " and how it should be " eradicated from the root			1
" those who doubt that such an attack is within the realm of possibilities should remember another @entity111 regime that based its legitimacy on military prowess and delusions of grandeur and that went from one devastating war to another ; former @entity119 president @entity118 's			2
at the time of his war with @entity123 , many considered him " the lesser of two evils			0
" in a fascist state , preserving the nation 's security , stability and unity against the machinations of internal and external enemies is dogma ; it is the founding myth of the @entity4 regime			1
the fact that @entity7 's forces have killed tens of thousands of @entity4 and thousands more are unaccounted for , turned millions of others into refugees , leveled entire cities to the ground , reduced the size of the @entity4 economy to a fraction of what it was before the civil war and turned @entity4 into the favorite destination of @entity21 militants worldwide in the process , should give those who are ready to turn a new page with him pause			1
writing in 1944 , the @entity153 novelist @entity152 justifiably advised against " degrade [ ing ] it to the level of a swearword " by labeling anything with which we strongly disagree as " fascism			0
" however , given its reprehensible brutality , insidious internal politics , and incendiary rhetoric over the past three years , one would be hard pressed to describe the @entity4 regime as anything other than that			1
while scholars have long struggled with succinctly defining fascism and its wide variants , a cursory look at the modus operandi of the @entity7 regime suggests that it embodies the most salient characteristics of the most militant type of fascism			1
a hallmark of fascism is the reverence for the " leader " who becomes the personification of the nation ; an attack on him becomes an attack on the entire nation			0
it is he who sets the vision for the people and there is little room for individual autonomy			0
@entity193 has left no doubt that he would rather destroy @entity4 than step down			2
fear , uncertainty , distrust like @entity118 , @entity7 's pervasive internal security apparatus has adversely affected the political culture of millions of his countrymen , allowing fear , uncertainly and distrust to dominate people 's psyches			1
and while @entity118 's torture chambers were revealed after the regime was toppled in 2003 , @entity7 's security forces ' atrocities are being documented on a daily basis , often by the perpetrators themselves			1
the recent disclosure by three war crimes prosecutors of gut - wrenching photographs showing the emaciated corpses of thousands of detainees who died in @entity7 's jails was more evidence suggesting that his atrocities are coming perilously close to those committed by the most infamous fascist regime in history : @entity225			1
( @entity0 can not independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs , documents and testimony referenced in the report , and is relying on the conclusions of the team behind it , which includes international criminal prosecutors , a forensic pathologist , an anthropologist and an expert in digital imaging			0
the @entity4 regime denies torturing detainees			2
the @entity4 @entity241 dismissed the report , telling @entity243 it was politicized and lacking of objectivity and professionalism			2
like other fascists before him , @entity7 has instilled an insidious ideology in his followers by controlling the media , and using the education system to inculcate a mind - set that glorifies war , militarism and witch - hunts			2
his regime has also become masterful at using short slogans intended to rouse his supporters ' nationalism and emotions , while simultaneously dehumanizing all of @entity4 's " enemies			1
" it is this indoctrination that enables @entity7 's henchmen to kidnap thousands of children out of their homes and torture them to death			1
it is also this pathological outlook that justifies @entity7 's alleged use of chemical weapons against civilian centers on more than one occasion			1
( @entity193 denies that his troops had anything to do with the attacks			0
) fascist regimes also have a history of using religion and ethnicity to widen cleavages in society to ensure that different groups do not conspire against them			0
despite all their talk about secularism , both @entity118 and @entity7 used religion to sow division , distrust and even fear among the various religious and ethnic groups			2
both brutally oppressed the religious majority and preyed on the fears of religious and ethnic minorities			0
potential attacks ? @entity118 surprised many when he attacked @entity123 and shocked the world when he invaded @entity295			0
and while @entity7 's reign thus far has not included such reckless military adventures , the past three years have unmasked the true fascist character of his regime			1
should he regain full control over @entity4 , @entity7 might feel emboldened and attack his main adversaries			1
if @entity4 becomes a full - fledged failed state , he may feel more compelled to deflect from his domestic weakness by undertaking a " heroic " show of strength to raise the morale of his supporters and to bring back to the fold some of his opponents under the banner of nationalism			0
as an added bonus , such an attack would also test the resolve of the @entity315 and its military footprint in the @entity317			0
the world has repeatedly underestimated the fascist mind - set			0
but just as it is standing united against terrorism , the international community should not forget the devastation that fascism unleashed on the world and realize that its specter is currently hovering over the @entity325			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity328 .			0

a fear of " terrorism " is *obscuring* the threat of fascism in @entity4 , writes @entity328
once a fascist mindset has been instilled into a support base , peace seldom follows , he says
if @entity7 's regime were to regain control of @entity4 , it might turn on other nations , he says
the world should remember the devastation wrought by fascist powers in the past , @entity328 says
