@entity0 , @entity1 -- the image of an aide to @entity1 's prime minister kicking a man protesting the mine disaster that has claimed nearly 300 lives has prompted outrage -- and has become a symbol of the anger felt against the government			1
the incident occurred as prime minister @entity14 visited the western city of @entity0 a day after the devastating mine fire			1
the man , detained by special forces , can be seen lying on the ground as the suited adviser to @entity14 , identified as @entity21 by @entity1 media and @entity23 , aims a kick at him			1
the shocking image outraged many in @entity1 , prompting an outpouring of anger on social media , and is seen as symbolizing the increasingly polarizing impact of @entity14 's authority on the country			1
it 's been nearly a year since anti-government protests first roiled @entity35 , prompting a response from authorities that was widely criticized as heavy - handed			2
@entity21 was quoted by @entity1 's semi-official @entity39 news agency as saying that he had been deeply saddened by wednesday 's events			1
" i am sad that i could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation , insults , and attacks that i was subjected to that day , " he reportedly said			2
besides the anger prompted by the photo , @entity14 's speech wednesday to relatives of dead and injured miners was seen as insensitive and drew scathing criticism			1
as public anger mounted through the evening , hundreds took to the streets in anti-government protests in @entity35 and @entity56 , with police answering , in some cases , with water cannons and tear gas			0
in @entity56 , the nation 's capital , some left black coffins in front of the @entity65 and the @entity67 and @entity68 ministry buildings			1
meanwhile , unions called for strikes across the country on thursday			0
at the mine , where what has become more of a recovery effort than a rescue continued , the mood was sullen , but there was little sign of the burning anger seen elsewhere over the accident			2
energy minister @entity81 said the number of coal miners confirmed dead had risen by one to 283 , as of thursday evening			1
three injured miners remain in the hospital , he said			0
the recovery operation is expected to continue overnight and into friday			0
a ' sorrow for the whole @entity1 nation ' president @entity90 offered words of comfort as he visited the western city , a day after his premier attracted public ire			1
the mine fire is a " sorrow for the whole @entity1 nation , " @entity90 told reporters , and he offered his condolences to the victims ' families			1
onlookers listened silently until a man interrupted @entity90 with shouts : " please , president ! help us , please ! " an investigation into the disaster has begun , @entity90 said , adding that he was sure this would " shed light " on what regulations are needed			0
" whatever is necessary will be done , " he said			0
he commended mining as a precious profession			0
" there 's no doubt that mining and working ... to earn your bread underground perhaps is the most sacred " of undertakings , he told reporters			2
@entity90 had entered the mine site with an entourage of many dozens of people -- mostly men in dark suits -- walking through a crowd of rescue workers who were standing behind loosely assembled police barricades			1
rescue and recovery workers retrieved more bodies thursday from the still smoldering coal mine			2
@entity133 marked the workers ' faces after they had stood and sat outside the mine for hours , idle and waiting			2
some of them passed the time talking on cell phones , others smoking or taking off their hard hats and burying their faces in their hands			0
with hope of finding survivors nearly gone , it appeared there was little they could do			0
funerals amid grief smoke and fumes are hindering efforts to reach more of those still missing below the surface and lessen the chances that any more will be found alive , even in special " safe " chambers equipped with oxygen and other supplies			0
fourteen bodies were found in one such chamber			0
more than a day has passed since anyone was pulled out alive			0
rescuers saved at least 88 miners in the frantic moments after a power transformer blew up tuesday during a shift change at the mine , sparking a choking fire deep inside			1
since then , the bodies of nearly 200 miners who were trapped in the burning shaft nearly a mile underground have been returned to their families			0
" enough , for the life for me ! " yelled one woman -- her arms flailing , tears running down her cheeks			0
" let this mine take my life , too ! " funerals took place thursday in a community stricken with grief			2
autopsies on dozens of bodies revealed the miners died of carbon monoxide poisoning			0
@entity14 said wednesday that as many as 120 more were trapped inside the mine , though that was before rescue crews grimly hurried a series of stretchers -- at least some clearly carrying corpses -- past the waiting crowd			1
in his much - criticized speech to the relatives of the dead and injured , the prime minister glossed over the issue of mine safety , describing the carnage they had suffered as par for the course in their dangerous business			1
apparently on the defensive , he rattled off a string of horrible past accidents , even going back to an example from 19th - century @entity209			0
as he took a stroll through the city , onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of " resign , prime minister ! " @entity1 foreign minister @entity216 defended the government 's response and @entity14 during an interview with @entity2 's @entity220 on thursday			1
" all the efforts will be done to check what was wrong , if there was anything wrong during this disaster or before , " he said , stressing the country 's standards are " quite high			2
" about @entity14 , @entity216 said : " he was feeling all these pains in his heart			1
everybody knows that our prime minister is always with the people , and always feels the pain of the people			1
otherwise , he would n't get such a high support in eight elections in ( the ) last 10 years			0
" scathing engineers ' accusations a group of engineers investigating the cause of the inferno made a scandalous accusation			0
" what happened in @entity0 is not fate , it is murder , " a local branch of the @entity248 wrote in all capital letters at the top of its official statement wednesday			0
although the group is not known for any party affiliation and comprises serious experts , such barbs have become common in a country riven with political division , where street protests and water cannons have become a familiar sight			0
the statement also reflects the anguish that has shaken @entity1 after what looks to be the deadliest mine disaster in its history			1
the latest death toll already tops a mining accident in the 1990s that took 260 lives			0
the chamber of electricians also contradicted the official version of how the fire started , saying : " the fire was not caused by an electrical situation as presented to the public in the first statements			2
" the assessment from inspectors from the chamber 's local branch in @entity282 on what happened suggests negligence may have played a part			2
" the inspection revealed that the systems to sense poisonous and explosive gases in the mine and the systems to manage the air systems were insufficient and old , " they said			2
the blaze started as a " coal fire " at 700 meters deep , and then air fans pushed the flames and smoke farther through the mine , the chamber concluded			1
the ventilation was not corrected until " much later			0
" the miners were trapped and inundated with smoke and fire			2
@entity0 's public prosecutor 's office has started an investigation of its own into the fire , @entity1 's semiofficial @entity39 news agency reported			1
political bonfire the chamber 's accusations land on top of those already heaped on @entity14 's government by his political opponents			1
opposition politician @entity315 from the @entity317 region , which includes @entity0 , filed a proposal in late april to investigate @entity1 mines after repeated deadly accidents			1
he has said that he is sick of going to funerals for miners in his district			0
several dozen members of opposition parties signed on to his proposal , but @entity14 's conservative government overturned it			1
some of its members publicly lampooned it , an opposition spokesman said			0
the mine , owned by @entity336 , underwent regular inspections in the past three years , two of them this march , @entity1 's government said			1
inspectors reported no violation of health and safety laws			0
waiting on dead friends for @entity344 , a miner waiting by the mine 's entrance for more of his friends to emerge , the mourning may go on much longer than the three days of official grieving ordered by @entity14			1
after what 's happened , he said , he 'll never work in a mine again			2
rescuers have n't given up hope that some miners reached emergency chambers stocked with gas masks and air and could still be alive			0
but @entity81 , the energy minister , said " hopes are diminishing " of rescuing anyone yet inside the mine			1
@entity344 has already given up			0
the miner knows that at least four of his friends are dead			2
despair , anger , dwindling hope after @entity1 coal mine fire @entity368 , @entity369 and @entity370 reported from western @entity1 ; @entity371 reported and wrote from @entity372 and @entity373 from @entity374			1
@entity2 's @entity375 , @entity376 and @entity377 contributed to this report .			0
