-- the crisis over the @entity3 constitution triggered by president @entity5 's adoption of sweeping powers is just the latest chapter in a long - standing ideological struggle in the @entity9			0
@entity5 , the @entity10 candidate who came to power after the 2011 @entity13 revolution that deposed long - time @entity3 president @entity14 , says he needs the new powers " to speed reform			1
" his rivals say it is all motivated by the @entity10 's @entity19 agenda for controlling the country			1
@entity5 is not the first -- and given the upheavals of the @entity22 , is unlikely to be the last -- @entity10 leader to seek a constitutional way to create functioning state institutions in a region where the collapse of the @entity28 led more often to tyranny or puppet regimes than strong democratic states			1
the drive to institutionalize the states of the @entity10 world was the primary objective for most political parties in the region in the early 20th century			1
@entity10 intellectuals , shocked by the tyranny and the deterioration of their nations - especially when compared to the rapid advance of the @entity42 both politically and militarily - tried to reverse the course by political means			1
however , they soon found out that confronting the old establishment would require more radical approaches			0
in 1907 , a constitutional revolution was declared in @entity48 , and a year later @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 marched in @entity52 -- triggering in 1908 what was called " the second constitutional era			2
" the events that followed eventually led to the dissolution of the @entity57			0
a decade later , the @entity28 found itself in an unprecedented situation , defeated and occupied by the @entity60 allies of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
the young @entity66 leader , @entity65 , led a national movement , fought the allies and the sultan , then pushed for constitutional changes by which the last @entity28 sultan , @entity72 , would be a spiritual leader , or " khalifa " , without any governing or symbolic authority			2
for the first time in the history of the @entity10 world , representatives of the people controlled the state			1
@entity72 was later expelled from @entity66 , and by 1924 the @entity85 system was abolished			0
this groundbreaking event left the @entity10 world in both religious and political chaos			1
at the time when the @entity89 were establishing new states for old peoples in the region , scholars and clerics from @entity95 to @entity96 went into extensive discussions about the vague future of the @entity10 " nation			1
" their task was not easy - even @entity65 had his own fatwa , or religious edict , to legitimize his deeds , issued by " pro-modernization " clerics			0
divided about the ways to adapt to change , the most prominent @entity10 clerics in 1926 decided to accept an invitation from @entity110 of @entity3 to submit a plan for the future			1
the king thought that the conclusion of the conference would see him anointed as the new " khalifa " of all @entity49 , but his dream vanished			0
many @entity3 clerics refused the idea of having a khalifa in a country under @entity61 occupation , and the liberal parties were keen to remind @entity110 about the 1923 constitution which he had issued himself in the wake of the huge changes , hundreds of miles away , in @entity66			2
the conference in @entity128 may not have been fruitful but it was decisive in reshaping the ideological map in the region			0
on one hand there was @entity134 , an influential cleric from what is now known as @entity136 , who led the call to re-establish the @entity85 system			0
on the other side stood the clerics of north @entity141 , spearheaded by @entity142 from @entity143 and @entity144 from @entity95 , who both praised @entity65 for his strong leadership , which they believed would benefit the @entity10 nation			1
amid confusion across the @entity149 world over about the proper source of power , the legitimate ruler and the true nature of constitutions , @entity155 -- one of @entity134 's most loyal followers - in 1928 formed the first version of what would later be known as the @entity10 movement			1
in one of his letters , @entity161 stated he was moving in the direction of establishing the movement in response to what he called the fall of the @entity85 system			0
he later came up with one of his movement 's most famous slogans : the " @entity172 is our constitution "			0
much has changed in the region during the last nine decades , but not the enigmatic nature of constitutionalism in this part of the world			2
numerous coups , wars and crises strangled or mutated any attempt to modernize the local states -- and old " dictators " , whether they were army generals or liberals or leftists , continued to manipulate the laws			2
constitutions were not social contracts , but rather a code of conduct imposed on the people			1
" subjects " were never transformed into " citizens " , and basic rights were " boons " granted by the rulers and could be easily revoked			0
constitutions had become just another tool in the hands of dictators			2
during that time , most @entity149 mainstream movements , including the @entity10 , acknowledged the need for having fundamental principles to run the political process - an easily drawn conclusion , given the decades of oppression to which the movements were subjected			1
but the movement could n't overcome the critical duality of " @entity172 is @entity212			0
" how could a divine script be protected by manmade principles and yet overpower them at the same time ? it is not a coincidence that constitutional reforms were considered a priority in all the @entity13 countries -- and that popular @entity149 movements in countries such as @entity223 and @entity3 have the upper hand in redrawing laws			1
@entity10 branches in @entity141 , especially @entity223 , were able to make use of the heritage of sheikhs @entity230 and @entity231 , and quickly abandoned the call for a @entity234 - based constitution			1
for them , the @entity66 model led by @entity236 to deal with constitutional problems is a better option			2
the task does n't look as easy for @entity5 and the @entity10 in @entity3			1
he is surrounded by @entity242 hardliners who are trying to outflank him on the far right as the country 's " true representatives " of @entity149 ; and on the other side is a coalition of liberal and national movements , including members of @entity14 's old party , who are " united in opposition to the vague ' @entity251 , ' " according to opposition coordinator @entity252			0
one can argue that @entity5 's constitutional decree unleashed a crisis , and that the draft is far from being perfect , especially for women and minorities			2
it might be a mistake , but it is a political one made by the first freely - elected @entity3 president			0
the most important thing to observe in this " spring " is that those who were labelled as " radicals " for decades are moving towards finding a constitutional frame for the internal political struggle			0
but those who are watching the scene from the @entity42 should keep in mind that the constitutional evolution in @entity271 was a slower and equally messy process .			0

drive to institutionalize states of @entity10 world was priority for most parties in early 1900s
for years constitutions were not social contracts , but a code imposed on people
constitutional reforms were considered a priority in all the @entity13 countries
