-- with frizzy hair still standing to attention , @entity2 's @entity1 drops dead , narrowly missing the nuke button as he slumps face - down onto his desk			2
welcome to the world of @entity9 -- a cartoonist whose knack for summing up major global events in a few simple brush strokes this week saw him become the first ever @entity14 to win the @entity16 's international cartoonist award			1
@entity9 will be familiar to regular readers of the @entity18 , the global version of the @entity20 , which prints his works of satire , slapstick and political comment on a daily basis			1
but while his day job is producing illustrations to match the headlines , @entity9 is one of a new breed of cartoonists who do their own reporting ; taking their sketchbooks and pens on to the front line of news gathering			1
such " graphic journalism , " says @entity9 , is often the most effective way of telling a story in a digital age where people are bombarded with information from all directions			1
" cartoons in their simplicity can help tell news stories and i think we will be using them more and more because they have a very special effect on people , " he told @entity0 by phone from @entity45 , shortly before flying to @entity46 to accept his prize			0
see a high - res gallery of @entity9 's prize - winning cartoons " i personally feel the need to report and i feel that cartoons will help us in a world that is overwhelmed with videos and images where we 're dealing with so much information every day			1
" among the dozen or so cartoons for which @entity9 is being honored is " @entity65 , " a striking example of graphic journalism for which he traveled to @entity69 to record the story of @entity71 , the man whose suicide sparked the @entity74 uprisings			1
@entity9 also recently completed " @entity80 " a powerful animated film , produced with the @entity76 , that documents victims of cluster bombs in southern @entity79			1
it is a project he hopes will lead to other similar work			0
" people react very strongly in an emotional way in that kind of storytelling , so i see a lot of hope for that genre in the future , " he said			0
born in @entity91 to a @entity93 father and @entity79 mother , @entity9 says he became an international cartoonist because he was an avid reader of newspapers in the numerous countries he grew up in			1
after placing his first cartoon ( about a man who broke out of jail for the seventh time ) in a local @entity93 newspaper at the age of 20 , he worked his way to @entity105 , where he was employed first by the @entity20 as an illustrator , then by @entity107 , which hired him to write a comic strip			1
@entity9 then landed the @entity18 job in @entity45 just a few days before the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , an event which tested his ability to " convey the feeling of @entity105 and the sense of the moment			2
" he must have done something right because , as he points out with typical deadpan humor : " they kept me			0
" @entity9 puts his own success down to the ability to " translate into a simple idea and a few brush strokes the gravity or the reality of things ... to show things as they are			2
" when you look at it and say , that 's exactly it ! that 's the best compliment people can give me			0
" this is no easy task , particularly when the internet exposes cartoons to global scrutiny , as was the case in 2005 when the @entity139 newspaper @entity138 sparked controversy and demonstrations throughout in the @entity143 world by printing a cartoon of the prophet @entity145			0
" that was the 9/11 of editorial cartooning , " says @entity9			2
he says he is wary about causing outrage with his own work			0
" we do n't all agree where the line is or where the balance is , " he adds			0
" i have a simple rule for myself			0
when i do a cartoon that can be seen as shocking for people , i want to be able to defend that cartoon eye - to - eye with the person that feels offended			2
" while he describes the @entity166 - @entity165 episode as a " controversy of the internet age , " @entity9 -- who has just returned from a graphic reporting assignment on urban violence in @entity163 -- remains enthusiastic about the potential of cyberspace			1
" the internet is full of possibilities in the language of cartoonists			0
you can do animated stuff and you can do multimedia stuff -- a whole new range of creativity			0
