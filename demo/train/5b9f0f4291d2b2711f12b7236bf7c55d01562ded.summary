@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 will wake up in @entity0 , @entity1 , on friday amid a five - state , four - day tour aimed at propping up embattled key @entity7 incumbents			1
@entity3 will fly to @entity8 , @entity1 , to attend a fundraiser luncheon at the @entity10 for sen. @entity11 and former gov. @entity12 , before delivering remarks at a @entity15 rally at @entity10 's @entity16			1
@entity11 has opened a slight lead against @entity19 @entity18 , as has @entity12 in his effort to win his old job back in a nasty battle with @entity19 @entity23			0
national democrats are still watching these races closely to ensure they do n't slip out of their hands			0
by friday evening , the president will be in @entity28 , @entity29 , to attend a @entity15 rally at a middle school before heading to a private residence for a fundraising event for sen. @entity34 and the @entity35			1
@entity34 is stuck in the mid- 40s in most polls , despite months painting his @entity19 opponent , @entity38 - friendly @entity37 , as an extremist			0
on saturday , @entity3 heads to @entity40 for a rally to support former sen. @entity42 , who is running for governor			2
the president also will headline a fundraiser for the @entity47 before heading back to the @entity48 on saturday evening			0
in addition , the president will attend another congressional campaign panel fundraiser monday in @entity52 before taking four days off from campaigning to tend to other business at the @entity48			2
as the president stumps across the @entity56 for several @entity7 incumbents , @entity15 officials revealed thursday he will shift his attention to the @entity59 and @entity60 in the final weekend before the midterm election			1
@entity3 will headline four major rallies for the @entity15 in the final stretch , starting saturday , october 30 , in @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66 , @entity67			2
both states have @entity7 battles that are simply too close to call , as well as competitive gubernatorial battles			0
also on that saturday , @entity3 will return home to @entity72 , where there is a tight gubernatorial fight and @entity76 @entity75 is locked in a bitter battle with @entity19 @entity78 for @entity3 's old @entity7 seat			0
the state is also home to a close re-election battle for @entity15 gov. @entity83			0
advisers to the president have privately said he 's particularly concerned about the symbolism on election night if his party ca n't even hold his former @entity7 seat , which is why first lady @entity3 and the president each campaigned in @entity91 earlier this month			1
on sunday , october 31 , the president will return again to @entity93 in his 12th visit as president -- just days after he and the first lady headlined their first joint rally there , drawing 35,000 people to the campus of @entity99			0
@entity48 aides have said they expect the president to be in @entity102 on @entity103 , though that could always change if @entity15 officials calculate that a last - minute visit will have an impact in another key race			1
vice president @entity108 will join @entity3 at the @entity110 , @entity93 , rally , according to @entity15 officials , as the @entity48 continues to very aggressively coordinate the travel of the president , vice president , and first lady for maximum benefit			2
@entity108 led campaign events earlier this week in @entity102 , @entity1 , and @entity29 -- three states the president is also hitting on his current five - state swing -- because of the urgency of saving incumbent sens. @entity121 , @entity11 , and @entity34			1
@entity3 will also be visiting @entity102 and @entity1 next week , and then will be in @entity28 for @entity34 on monday , november 1 , the day before @entity103			1
that same day she will also headline an event in @entity64 , a sure sign that the @entity48 believes that @entity125 , the @entity15 candidate for @entity7 that many pundits had written off , has a legitimate shot of knocking off @entity19 @entity128 .			0
