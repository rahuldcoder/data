@entity0 -- @entity2 crosses erected along @entity4 public roads to honor fallen state highway troopers have been found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court			1
a three - judge panel of the 10th @entity8 ruled wednesday that the 14 large crosses would be viewed by most passing motorists as " government 's endorsement of @entity13			1
" " we hold that these memorials have the impermissible effect of conveying to the reasonable observer the message that the state prefers or otherwise endorses a certain religion , " concluded the @entity15 , @entity16 - based court			2
the state of @entity4 and a private trooper association have the option of appealing to the @entity27 @entity26			1
a @entity29 - based group , @entity28 , successfully sued five years ago to have the nonprofit memorial project scrapped , and the crosses removed from public property			1
at issue was whether the crosses violated the @entity35 of the @entity36 , by having the government endorsing the @entity13 symbols , even if indirectly			1
although the suit went against the memorial project , the crosses were allowed to remain pending appeals in the case			2
they are still in place			0
the @entity46 in 1998 began erecting the monuments , which contain the fallen trooper 's name , rank , and badge number			2
a picture of the officer and some biographical information is included on a separate plaque placed where the two bars of the cross meet			0
the state insignia is also included , which the judges in particular raised with constitutional concerns			0
the service group said their main message was not religious in nature , but among other things , to serve as " a lasting reminder to @entity46 members and @entity4 highway patrol troopers that a fellow trooper gave his life in service to this state " and to " encourage safe conduct on the highways			1
" while placed on public land and with the state 's permission , the crosses themselves are privately owned and maintained			1
the state expressly noted it " neither approves or disapproves of the memorial marker			0
" in rejecting the crosses , the appeals court made several arguments , such as the large size and location of the crosses -- on busy public highways where motorists can not help but notice			1
other similar memorial crosses have been erected on public land such as @entity91 to honor fallen war dead			1
but the judges noted those markers are generally accessible or visible only to those who expressly choose to visit them , unlike roads where citizens can not help but see them			0
the @entity26 has in recent years taken a case - by - case approach to @entity35 cases			0
the justices in 1947 said the government needed to be " neutral " but " not an adversary " toward religion			0
the court has upheld legislative chaplaincies , tax exemptions for churches , and the mention of " @entity110 " on @entity27 currency and in oaths of office			0
at the same time , government - sponsored school prayer is banned , and limits imposed on aid to parochial schools			0
the court 's record on religious displays on public land is more mixed , with " context " a key criteria			1
the justices last year decided on free - speech grounds a small religious group could not erect a granite monument in a @entity4 park next to an existing @entity130 display , which for the time being was allowed to stay			1
and this past june , the conservative majority of the court concluded a cross designed as war memorial in lonely stretch of national parkland in the @entity139 desert did not violate the constitutional separation of church and state			2
in 2005 , a @entity130 monument on the @entity29 statehouse grounds was allowed to stand , since it was surrounded by historical markers			0
but the same day @entity147 parchments in two @entity149 county courthouses were ruled unconstitutional , with the high court majority calling them " a governmental effort substantially to promote religion , not simply an effort primarily to reflect , historically , the secular impact of a religiously inspired document			0
" and some nativity scenes and menorahs placed in public parks during december have been allowed to stand , while some were ordered removed			2
the @entity159 rejected arguments from the @entity46 that many roads contain crosses or other religious symbols placed by private individuals honoring a dead relative killed in car accidents			2
" the mere fact that the cross is a common symbol used in roadside memorials does not mean it is a secular symbol , " said the panel			0
" the massive size of the crosses displayed on @entity4 's rights - of - way and public property unmistakably conveys a message of endorsement , proselytization , and aggrandizement of religion that is far different from the more humble spirit of small roadside crosses			1
" the judges also disregarded suggestions that since most of the deceased troopers were @entity187 , where the @entity4 - based @entity188 does not uses the cross as a religious symbol , the highway memorials were merely symbols of death and did not promote a a particular faith			1
there was no immediate reaction to the opinion from @entity28 or the @entity46			0
the case is @entity28 v. @entity197 ( 08 - 4061 ) .			0

in @entity4 , 14 large crosses on public roads honor fallen state troopers
an atheists ' group successfully sued to have the crosses removed from public land
a federal appeals court panel agreed in a ruling on wednesday
the panel said the crosses could be seen as " government endorsement of @entity13 "
