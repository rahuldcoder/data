-- the pilot killed in the @entity5 's @entity4 disaster moved an unlocking device earlier than he should have , investigators said			1
but that alone might not have caused the spaceship to disintegrate 45,000 feet in the air , killing co-pilot @entity10 and injuring co-pilot @entity11 , who managed to parachute to the ground			2
while the the @entity14 said it is " months and months away " from determining the cause , it outlined two problems involving the spacecraft 's " feathering " -- a process used to slow the spacecraft down toward @entity20			1
in order for feathering to start , two things have to happen : someone has to unlock the feathering system , and someone has to activate the system with a different handle			1
the @entity14 has said the unlocking device was moved too early			1
on monday night , the agency said @entity10 was the one who unlocked the feathering system			1
" ... the copilot , who was in right seat , moved the lock / unlock handle into unlock position ; he did not survive accident , " the @entity14 tweeted			1
... the copilot , who was in right seat , moved the lock / unlock handle into unlock position ; he did not survive accident			0
# @entity4 but that mishap alone does n't explain why the feathering started , since no one moved the feathering handle			1
during feathering , two pieces on the back of the vehicle -- the " feathers " -- lift up perpendicular to the spaceship , making the vehicle look like it 's arching its back as it descends			1
@entity52 mourns pilot , says space travel worth its risks plastic fuel a team of 13 to 15 investigators from the @entity14 will be in the @entity59 for about a week			1
but analyzing the data from the test aircraft will take much longer , and the investigation may take up to a year			0
opinion : the truth about launching spaceships friday 's flight was the first to use a new plastic - based fuel , something that @entity0 aviation analyst @entity70 has said could have affected the plane 's stability , despite the fuel tanks being found intact			2
@entity70 said that @entity5 had " consistently underestimated the risk involved			0
" but @entity5 founder @entity52 denied this , saying that 400 " of the best engineers in the world " were working on the project and that the risks were similar to those taken by people flying across the @entity81 in the 1920s and ' 30s			0
@entity86 may take up to a year veteran pilot killed a memorial fund has been set up for @entity10 's family			2
he worked at @entity90 , the company that partnered with @entity5 on the test flight program , and logged more than 1,600 hours as a test pilot and test engineer in @entity90 aircraft			0
analysis : will space accidents deter pioneer tourists ? @entity90 said sunday that co-pilot @entity11 -- the company 's director of flight operations -- was alert and speaking with family and doctors			1
@entity4 helmed by experienced pilots when flight failed future of the program for years , @entity5 had planned to sell trips in which @entity4 would transport passengers about 62 miles above @entity20 -- the beginning of outer space -- and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to the ground			0
@entity5 planned to send paying customers on @entity4 as early as next year and has sold more than 700 tickets , each costing more than $ 250,000 , for future flights			2
deadly day for space tourism -- but future ' rests ' on such days , official says several celebrities have already signed up , including @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
friday 's tragedy was not the first fatal accident to hit the @entity5 space program			2
in 2007 , three employees of @entity90 were killed during testing in the @entity59			0
sources told @entity0 that they had been testing components of a new rocket motor for @entity4			0
@entity0 's @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0

@entity14 : the co-pilot who died unlocked the spacecraft 's feathering device early
but that still does n't explain why the " feathering " system was activated
the @entity14 says it could take months and months to determine the cause of the disaster
