-- the driver of a train that jumped the tracks last month at @entity5 's @entity4 -- after having reportedly " dozed off " -- has been fired , a transit authority spokeswoman said friday			1
the early morning incident at one of the nation 's busiest airports was the operator 's second serious safety violation , according to @entity14 spokeswoman @entity13			1
that said , @entity16 said the woman was primarily terminated because of the severity of that crash , which injured 32 people			1
the development came the same day the transit authority announced several policy changes aimed at enhancing safety			2
they include requirements that train operators not be working at least one day in a seven - day period and must have at least 10 hours off between shifts ( up from the previous 8 - hour mandate )			0
train operators also ca n't work more than 12 hours ( including layover times and non-driving duties ) in a 14 - hour period			0
fresh restrictions were also placed on those in their first year of operating trains : they ca n't do so more than 32 hours a week , though these employees can " work other rail - related duties besides operating trains in their other work hours , " the transit authority said in its statement friday			2
these revised guidelines are " nearly identical " to those used by other transit agencies , according to @entity16			0
she said " nothing about the operator 's work schedule suggests that fatigue should have played a factor in her performance			1
" the driver had a day off four days before the incident , had n't worked for 18 hours before coming to work that day and worked 55.7 hours in the seven previous days ( less than 44 of those as a rail operator ) , according to the transit authority spokeswoman			1
that said , @entity16 acknowledged , " the @entity4 incident prompted us to take a closer look at our scheduling			2
" the wreck occurred at 2:52 a.m. on march 24 , when an eight - car train failed to stop at the end of the @entity70 when it arrived at the airport station , a @entity66 official said			1
the lead car appeared to have climbed an escalator adjacent to the passenger platform			0
" i 've investigated many accidents and trains do different things , " @entity76 investigator @entity75 said of the train climbing the escalator			0
" it 's all about kinetic force			0
i have not seen an accident like this , personally			0
" a union official told reporters last month that the train 's driver may have fallen asleep , @entity0 affiliate @entity85 reported			1
" there are indications that she dozed off , yes , " @entity91 local 308 president @entity90 said , according to @entity85			2
@entity0 's @entity95 and @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
