-- @entity1 lives for sailing			1
he grew up near the sea , and he wants to retire on the ocean wave			2
but before then , the most successful yachtsman in @entity7 history is taking on one of the biggest challenges his sport has to offer -- the @entity11			1
from dominating the world of dinghy racing as a fiercely competitive individual -- who once famously warned his rivals , " you do n't want to make me angry " -- the 36 - year - old is now learning to helm towering 72 - foot multihull catamarans			1
the masts are 130 - foot high -- more than 20 times the average height of the 11 crew			2
" i really love these boats because they are very physical , they 're very dynamic , they 're fast , exciting and the racing is very close , and i think it 's great to watch on tv now , " the @entity24 told @entity0 's human to @entity26			1
" the top speed of these boats is around about 30 knots , or 35 miles an hour , which is pretty quick when you 're that close to the water			2
" while @entity36 has a strong naval history and has had a lot of sailing success in the @entity7 -- @entity40 won four golds and a silver medal -- it has never won the @entity11 , the elite competition in yachting that is funded by billionaires and traditionally dominated by the @entity47 since it started in 1851			1
" all my career the @entity11 has been a goal , i 've always wanted to be with a winning team -- preferably a winning @entity36 team -- and i really felt that i 'd done all i could at the @entity7 level , " he said			1
" we 've never won it so i think there 's something there in our maritime history ... we really need to put that record straight			1
" @entity40 has set up his own team with a view to taking part in a future @entity11 , but for now he has taken on a role as helmsman for the second boat run by defending champion @entity67 ahead of the 34th edition of the race in @entity70 in september , making him effectively a reserve to its no. 1 @entity72 of @entity74			1
his @entity77 - sponsored @entity76 team -- which is supported by @entity67 -- finished third in the final event of the @entity79 in @entity80 this month , competing in smaller 45 - foot catamarans			1
" it will take time			2
we 're building the team up through this series , " he said			2
" that 's great for us to get out there racing against these other teams and learn how to get the most speed out of these multihulls			0
" from there on it 's going to be important to really start building the commercial relationships so we have the funding in place for 2014 onwards so we can really start building up the team			0
" from being his own boss in the dinghy classes , @entity40 is now learning to enjoy being part of a collective effort			0
" that element of team work is something that 's really critical , " he said			0
" it 's also a lot of fun sailing with other guys rather than just on your own all the time			0
" the @entity11 is big business			1
@entity67 owner @entity114 -- last year named the third - richest man in the @entity47 -- spent a reported $ 300 million before winning the coveted title in 2010			1
that victory came after a series of lawsuits against the defending team @entity120 which delayed the historic competition and raised big doubts about its future			0
it will be hosted by an @entity47 syndicate , the @entity125 , for the first time since 1995 and @entity67 -- as it has the right as defender -- has revamped the rules to bring the racing closer to shore and more accessible to spectators			0
but while the sport has an elitist image , @entity40 says that anyone can enjoy sailing			0
" people think it 's either a very expensive sport or it 's just far too complicated -- and really it 's neither , " said the @entity136 , whose family moved to @entity138 on the south - west coast of the @entity36 when he was young			1
" at the grassroots level you can go down to a sailing club and you can just get into a dinghy and borrow a boat or start sailing and crewing for someone else and get into it for very little money			0
" @entity40 's @entity7 days came to a glorious golden end at @entity153 , as he overcame what he thought were dubious race tactics to beat his rivals and claim the @entity159 title in the final race			1
he accused @entity161 and @entity163 @entity162 of teaming up on him , forcing him to do a penalty turn in race two , which left him trailing			0
@entity40 went public with his displeasure			0
" they 've made a big mistake , " he told reporters , and promptly fought back to match the record for successive sailing golds held by the legendary @entity170			2
" it was the highlight of my career and so special being in front of a home crowd and being my fourth gold medal , " he said			1
it capped a @entity180 career which began as a teenager in @entity182 in 1996 where his " disappointment " at having to settle for a silver medal in the @entity189 gave an early glimpse of his burning desire for victory			1
the 19 - year - old @entity40 was edged out of the top spot on the podium by the hugely experienced @entity193 @entity192 , but he was never beaten again in @entity7 competition			1
" it was a great achievement for my age but in a way something inside of me still wanted more and i guess that what 's drove me on , " @entity40 admitted			0
by the time the @entity180 came along four years later @entity40 was ready to take his revenge on @entity192 , relegating him to the silver medal position after a bitter and often controversial personal battle			1
" i had an immense rivalry with @entity192 and i just managed to come out on top of that , and from then on really that gave me the confidence to come back each time and take the gold , and fortunately i was able to do that , " he said			2
after the @entity213 he stepped up to the more demanding @entity159 , meaning he had to add nearly 20 kilograms of extra body weight to be competitive in his new discipline in a bigger boat			1
" that was a big switch physically , i had to try and do most of that in muscle so i got into a lot of weight training and fitness training , " he said			0
" i guess it put quite a lot of load on the body as well and hence the back injuries which i started picking up later on in my career			0
" those injury niggles were the result of hours of training in the gym and on the water , pushing himself to the limit in search of that fourth gold -- in front of fanatical home support at the southern coastal resort of @entity242 , where the sailing events for @entity153 were held			1
" the pressure for @entity245 was like nothing else i 've ever experienced , " @entity40 said			0
a hint of the almost crushing weight of expectation came as he competed for a sixth world championship title in the @entity159 in @entity252 in late 2011 , one of his last major competitions before @entity245			2
after finishing second in race nine of the event , @entity40 made the headlines for the wrong reasons after swimming over to a media boat and angrily remonstrating with the crew			0
he felt they had impeded his progress during a downwind leg and his frustration boiled over			0
@entity40 's subsequent disqualification was a bitter pill , but he later apologized for " overreacting			0
" although injuries have taken their toll on @entity40 -- whose success at @entity153 earned him a knighthood from @entity273 -- he says that he has never lost his love for being on the water			2
" if i get a holiday or some down time i love still sailing , but not racing -- just going out on maybe a beautiful classic yacht , relaxing with friends and being on the water , " he said			0
" my idea of retirement would be having a nice boat , sailing around the world and exploring and being able to relax and enjoy being on the water -- to just enjoy life without running around quite so hectically ! "			0
