-- the name he chose for the next installment in his " @entity6 " video game series makes @entity7 seem prescient			1
as the famed shepherd of the spy franchise he created 25 years ago , @entity7 remains deeply involved in the game development process			1
yet , @entity7 had n't foreseen that his project would undergo a death and rebirth , like the phoenix bird from @entity16 mythology			1
as it turns out , the irony of the name " @entity19 " is unintentional			0
" i canceled it , " @entity7 said of the game , in a recent phone interview with @entity0			1
" i made the decision			0
i just thought that nothing good would come out of this			0
" instead , " rising " is back on track			1
the new chapter is meant to be a sort of departure for the series , emphasizing action and swordplay over the stealth movements that " @entity6 " games are renowned for			2
in june , a fresh take on the game that was once killed will be ready for gamers to play for the first time at the @entity41 industry trade show , reports @entity43 's @entity42			2
developers at @entity45 and @entity46 had initially spearheaded the project , then called " metal gear solid : rising , " as they 've done for most games in the franchise			1
a version for @entity52 was announced in the summer of 2009			0
@entity7 had placed " rising " in the hands of some young developers within his company , but they did n't have the expertise to deliver the action game he wanted , he said			1
" it was almost lost when they were making it , " @entity7 said			0
" it 's not that we do not have any good game designers in our development team			2
however , the concept for ' rising ' was completely new			2
" with " rising " shelved , @entity7 and his teams continued to work on their various other " @entity6 " projects , including a high - definition remaster of older games that hit stores in november and a mysterious open - ended game that @entity7 is reluctant to talk much about			1
rumors had begun to surface that the game would not get made , and that piqued the interest of a little - known @entity78 , @entity43 , developer named @entity80			1
when @entity7 spoke with executives there about reviving the project , they were enthusiastic , he said			2
@entity80 delivered a thorough proposal , which won @entity7 over , he said			0
the game and its story have changed considerably from the original concept , said @entity7 , who is an executive producer on the project			1
even the name is different			0
it will be called " @entity19 : revengeance " when it debuts this year			0
" if this game becomes hugely successful and popular , then we might make it into a franchise , " @entity7 said			2
in a game about sword fighting , support for the latest motion - control gaming systems -- @entity101 's @entity100 and @entity103 's @entity102 -- would seem to be a natural fit , but @entity45 has not described how it will be controlled			1
in a previous interview , @entity45 president @entity105 declined to comment on the game 's control scheme			0
after " rising , " @entity7 expects more " @entity110 " games to be made , but he has n't decided whether he will design them , he said			1
gamers recognize @entity7 's meticulousness , which is why he has such a dedicated following			0
( he has about 136,000 people following his @entity43 @entity117 account , and another 89,000 following an official english - translation page			0
) evidence of his perfectionism can be found in the development of " @entity110 : @entity122 , " a remake of an 8 - year - old game to be released on @entity127 's @entity126 - held system			1
the @entity126 has two screens , one of which can display games in three dimensions without requiring the player to wear special glasses			0
" we are trying to make it as easy to use as possible , " @entity7 said			0
" we 're taking a lot of care in the very small details , like when you lay down , using the screen below to change your weapons			0

the " @entity110 : rising " game was initially canceled
the project was revived with the help of a third - party developer
" rising " involves action and sword fighting instead of the usual *sneaking* around
