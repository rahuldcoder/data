@entity0 and @entity1 resumed campaigning monday , with both men focusing on the economy as key to their chances of winning the votes of @entity8 in november			1
@entity0 told supporters in @entity10 that he entered office four years ago seeking to restore " the basic bargain that made @entity8 the greatest nation on @entity14			1
" he cited the idea that " if you work hard , then you can get ahead ; if you 're responsible , then you can live out your dreams			0
you 're not confined to the circumstances of your birth			0
" @entity1 , meanwhile , said in a tv interview that " in my opinion , the issue people care about is who can get the @entity8 economy going again to help people have a brighter future , with rising wages and more capacity to care for their kids and to know that their kids will get good jobs when they come out of school			1
" that 's what this campaign is about , " the presumptive @entity39 nominee said on " @entity40			0
" @entity0 said he entered office at a time that the @entity43 " was slipping away from too many people " and that " incomes and wages were flat - lining while the cost of everything -- from college to health care to groceries to gas -- were all going up			1
" he said his goal has been to reclaim that dream , but that he recognized when he became president that " it might take more than one term , maybe more than one president " to do so			0
speaking from @entity57 , @entity1 focused on @entity0 's performance in office and found it wanting : " there are 23 million people that are out of work and ( who have ) stopped looking for work , " he said			1
" median income has dropped 10 % over the last four years			0
the @entity8 people know whether things are better now than they were four years ago ... he ( @entity0 ) just has n't been able to do the job he told us he was going to try to do			1
" but @entity0 sought to deflect the blame and appealed to his audience for support			1
" the problem is that we 've got a stalemate right now in @entity78 , " he said			0
" this election is about more than just two candidates or political parties			0
it 's about two different visions about how do we build a strong economy			0
the good news is you 're the tie - breaker			0
the choice is up to you			0
" @entity0 also cited a new report that estimates that @entity1 's support for eliminating @entity8 taxes on @entity8 companies ' foreign incomes would create an incentive for @entity8 companies to move more of their jobs overseas			1
@entity97 : facts do n't support @entity0 's claims " we have not found any serious economic study that says governor @entity1 's economic plan would actually create jobs until today , " @entity0 said			1
" i 've got to be honest , today we found out there 's a new study out by nonpartisan economists that says governor @entity1 's economic plan would , in fact , create 800,000 jobs			1
there 's only one problem			0
the jobs would n't be in @entity8			1
" the @entity1 campaign quickly fired back			2
" president @entity0 is at it again today with another dishonest attack meant to distract from his own record of failure , " @entity1 campaign spokeswoman @entity113 told @entity114			1
" after spending three years pushing policies that drive jobs overseas and sending taxpayer money to foreign - owned companies , it 's clear president @entity0 does n't have a clue when it comes to job creation in @entity8			1
" the @entity8 corporate tax rate is the highest in the industrial world , which hurts the ability of @entity8 businesses to compete globally and to create jobs in the @entity8 , she said			1
" @entity1 has a comprehensive plan to reform the corporate tax code that will lower rates , get rid of incentives for firms to create jobs in other countries , and encourage the kind of economic growth president @entity0 has been unable to deliver , " she added			1
the new back - and - forth came as both campaigns have repeatedly accused the opposing candidate of outsourcing @entity8 jobs overseas			1
on another topic , @entity1 defended his release of his 2010 tax return and the promised release of his 2011 return as sufficient , despite calls from critics that he make public earlier returns			2
" @entity156 ran for president and released two years of tax returns , " the former ceo of @entity154 said of the 2008 @entity39 candidate			0
" the @entity0 people keep on wanting more and more and more , more things to pick through , more things for their opposition research to try to make a mountain out of and to distort and to be dishonest about			2
" @entity164 : @entity1 's painfully bad week that stance is largely consistent with @entity1 's position during his 2002 campaign for @entity169 governor			1
@entity1 's @entity171 rival that year , @entity170 , released her tax information and called on @entity1 to do the same			1
" people who run for public office are exposed to extraordinary scrutiny , and that 's as it should be , but there are some things that are not required for release , that are private , and i think my own income taxes , and my net worth and so forth are things i 'd like to keep between myself and my family , " @entity1 said in may 2002 , according to the @entity173			1
his longtime strategist @entity186 cited the family 's " privacy " and noted that state law did not require candidates to provide anything more than a financial disclosure form filed with the state @entity191			0
on sunday , @entity0 's senior campaign adviser @entity195 told @entity114 's " @entity196 " such limited disclosure only raised more questions about @entity1 's finances			1
" i can only conclude , with all these @entity39 asking him to release these returns , that whatever is in those returns would be more damaging to his campaign than simply not releasing them , " @entity195 said			0
some @entity39 began pushing @entity1 to release tax information over the weekend , saying it would be politically savvy to release the information to avoid a drawn - out fight with @entity171			2
" he should release the tax returns tomorrow			0
it 's crazy , " conservative columnist @entity210 said on " @entity212			0
" " you got ta release six , eight , 10 years of back tax returns			0
take the hit for a day or two			0
" all of this , @entity1 said monday , was a distraction from the real issues of the campaign			2
he said his own campaign was happy to compare itself with @entity0 's administration on transparency , citing the president 's use of executive privilege to withhold documents related to the botched " @entity229 " program			1
" the administration has shown a serious departure from the transparency from which they suggested we had , " @entity1 said			2
" and the @entity8 people should be calling for that kind transparency			2
" families object to @entity238 's ban on politicians @entity39 sen. @entity240 defended @entity1 against @entity0 's " personal " attacks , saying the @entity242 was focusing on @entity1 because his own record falls short			1
@entity240 , speaking in @entity244 , @entity245 , was holding an event for @entity1 roughly two hours ahead of @entity0 's own campaign speech in nearby @entity10			1
" he 's attacking @entity1 on a personal basis			1
why ? because he does n't want to talk about his record , " the @entity39 from @entity245 said			0
@entity240 is widely speculated to be a potential vice-presidential pick for @entity1			2
last week @entity240 said he met with @entity1 campaign staffers during three meetings while in @entity253 to headline a couple of fund - raisers for the presumptive @entity39 presidential nominee			2
but @entity240 , a former congressman and cabinet member in the @entity259 administration , said the meetings were not at the @entity1 campaign headquarters , and had nothing to do with the vice presidential vetting process			2
on monday , he refused to speculate on the vice presidential selection process , nor would he say whether @entity1 had made up his mind on his running mate			1
@entity240 added , " people vote for the presidential candidate , not the vice president			0
" another potential vice presidential pick said monday he had spoken with the @entity1 aides involved in the search			2
sen. @entity273 of @entity274 told @entity275 that he had traveled to @entity253 to meet with @entity276 , who is leading @entity1 's search for a vice presidential pick , along with other senior advisers at the presumptive @entity39 nominee 's headquarters			1
@entity273 would not say whether he was being formally vetted by @entity1 's team			1
@entity273 would provide geographic balance on a potential @entity39 ticket , though he would not offer a large degree of ideological disparity with the likely @entity39 nominee			0
@entity273 decided against making his own presidential bid in february 2011 , but is considered a @entity39 hero for toppling incumbent @entity290 , then the top @entity242 in the @entity291 , in 2004			0
@entity273 chairs the @entity292 , which controls the party 's message in the @entity291 , and is often mentioned as a presidential contender down the road			0
also monday , @entity297 , the super pac backing @entity1 , announced it had brought in $ 20 million in june			2
that marks a major jump from the prior month , when @entity297 reported bringing in $ 4.6 million			0
the spike was not a surprise , however , since the group received a $ 10 million donation from @entity305 casino mogul @entity304 and his wife , @entity306 , in june			0
also helping the group was the first donation from @entity309 , a millionaire who backed the @entity311 super pac			0
he told @entity114 he gave a six - figure donation to @entity297 last month , though he refused to give the exact amount			0
@entity297 was active during the @entity39 primary , spending $ 38.9 million in the first three months of 2012			0
much of its money went to campaign television commercials in support of @entity1 and critical of his rivals for the @entity39 presidential nomination .			2

@entity0 says he 's seeking to restore " the basic bargain " that made @entity8 great
@entity1 says the president " just has n't been able to do the job "
the campaigns disagree over whether @entity1 plan would send more jobs overseas
