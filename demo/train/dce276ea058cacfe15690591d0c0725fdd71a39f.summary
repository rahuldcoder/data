-- some court - appointed guardians for incapacitated seniors are not screened before they 're appointed , and many are not monitored by the courts after they 've taken over the affairs of their charges , resulting in hundreds of allegations of abuse , a federal probe found			1
an investigation by the @entity12 found allegations of abuse by legal guardians in 45 states and the @entity16 , according to an advance copy of the report obtained by @entity0			1

in some instances , these same guardians abused or physically neglected the people they were supposed to help and protect			2
in six of the 20 cases examined , the courts failed to screen guardians before giving them control over the financial affairs and care of their wards , the federal agency found			1
in one case in @entity41 , a former taxi driver and convicted bank robber was appointed the legal guardian of a wealthy customer who had no family			1
as the elderly man developed alzheimer 's disease , his guardian stole more than $ 640,000 from him , writing checks out of the victim 's estate to pay for exotic dancers and a new hummer , court records show			2
in @entity59 , an 80 - year - old woman 's niece was appointed guardian of her wealth and well - being , despite having declared bankruptcy twice and being arrested numerous times for writing bad checks , according to court documents cited in the @entity12 probe			1

a certified professional guardian failed to visit one of her wards for eight months , according to documents from a case in the state of @entity85			2
the same guardian was then appointed to oversee another elderly person 's estate , despite having $ 87,000 in tax liens filed against her			1
courts failed to oversee the conduct of appointed guardians in 12 of the 20 cases studied in the federal investigation , therefore allowing the abuse and financial exploitation to continue unobserved , sometimes for years , the federal report said			1

the husband became the guardian of a 50 - year - old female patient , allowing the couple to steal $ 250,000 from the woman , court documents show			2

federal investigators also tested guardian certification required in a handful of states			0
to test to see whether this certification process would deter criminal - minded guardians from entering the system , investigators applied for the certification in @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
