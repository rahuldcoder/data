-- @entity1 on thursday set out demanding conditions for any talks with @entity4 and @entity5 , calling for the withdrawal of @entity8 sanctions against it and a permanent end to joint @entity12 - @entity13 military exercises			1
the @entity12 and @entity13 " should immediately stop all their provocative acts against the @entity1 and apologize for all of them , " the @entity1 's @entity14 said in a statement carried by state - run media , using the shortened version of @entity1 's official name , the @entity1			1
the commission listed a number of " practical measures " it said the @entity12 and @entity13 should take if they want to avoid " sledge - hammer retaliatory blows of the army and people " of @entity1 and if " they truly stand for dialogue and negotiations			1
" but the nature of the demands , such as the lifting of the @entity8 sanctions imposed after the @entity1 's latest nuclear test , appeared to offer almost no chance of negotiations between the two sides amid heightened tensions on the @entity42			1
@entity1 : lifting of @entity8 sanctions if a condition for talks with @entity12 " it is hard to understand @entity1 's claims , " @entity46 , a spokesman for the @entity13 foreign ministry , said at a news briefing			1
" a torrent of unnerving threats from @entity54 in recent weeks has strained already fragile relations in the region			0
the @entity1 's rhetoric intensified when the @entity58 voted last month to slap the tougher sanctions on the regime and amid the @entity12 - @entity13 military drills under way in @entity13 at the moment			1
the @entity12 said this month that for it to enter talks , @entity1 would have to show a serious commitment to moving away from its nuclear program , something the regime of @entity70 insists it wo n't do			1
on thursday , the @entity1 suggested that the @entity12 would have to make the first move on the nuclear issue			0
" they should bear in mind that the denuclearization of the @entity42 can begin with the pullout of the nuclear war means introduced by the @entity12 and this may lead to the global denuclearization , " the defense commission said			0
@entity1 has repeatedly described the annual military exercises taking place in @entity13 as threats of nuclear war , singling out aspects of the drills like the practice mission flown by @entity12 stealth bombers as evidence			2
the stealth bombers can carry conventional or nuclear weapons , but they used inert munitions in their training flight			0
@entity1 's missile capabilities the @entity12 says such displays of military strength during the drills were aimed at reassuring it allies in the region , not antagonizing the regime in @entity54			2
president @entity102 warned @entity70 this week that the @entity1 's threats against the @entity12 and @entity13 had only served to isolate the regime further			2
" this is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in and his grandfather before that , " @entity102 said in an interview with @entity105 broadcast tuesday , referring to the two previous @entity1 leaders @entity107 and @entity108			0
" since i came into office , the one thing i was clear about was , we 're not going to reward this kind of provocative behavior			0
you do n't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way , " he said			0
nuclear weapons : who has what ? @entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity5 says the @entity1 's demands are " preposterous "
the @entity135 lists " practical measures " it says the @entity12 and @entity13 should take
it wants @entity8 sanctions to be lifted and no more @entity12 - @entity13 military drills
the @entity12 has said talks can only happen if the @entity135 moves away from its nuclear program
