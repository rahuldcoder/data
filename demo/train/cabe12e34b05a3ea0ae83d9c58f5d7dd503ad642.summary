@entity0 -- media magnate @entity2 traveled to @entity0 friday as he seeks to rein in a crisis over alleged misconduct at the embattled @entity7 newspaper , part of his huge @entity10 empire			1
@entity2 's visit follows the saturday arrests of five @entity7 journalists as part of an inquiry into alleged illegal payments to @entity18 police and officials			1
in what appeared to be a bid to boost morale , @entity2 told staffers at @entity7 -- @entity18 's best selling newspaper -- that the company will launch a sunday edition of the paper			1
staff at the paper have reacted angrily to the arrests and internal investigations of their journalistic practices , which they have likened to a witch - hunt			0
the launch of a @entity7 on sunday newspaper to replace the @entity36 , a sister paper to @entity7 that was shuttered amid a phone - hacking scandal in the summer , had been widely rumored			1
however , this is the first time @entity10 's @entity18 subsidiary , @entity40 , has confirmed the move			2
in an e-mail to staff at @entity7 , @entity2 said the company would " build on @entity7 's proud heritage by launching @entity7 on sunday very soon			1
" he also said he had great respect for the " exceptional journalism " produced by @entity7 , but that it must abide by the law			2
" my continuing respect makes this situation a source of great pain for me , as i know it is for each of you , " he wrote			0
" we will obey the law			0
illegal activities simply can not and will not be tolerated -- at any of our publications			1
" in a sign of support for the arrested journalists , none of whom have been charged , @entity2 said all suspensions had been lifted and that they could return to work			2
@entity10 will cover their legal expenses , he said , adding : " everyone is innocent until proven guilty			2
" but he made clear that the newspaper could not protect anyone who had paid public officials			0
the arrests are part of @entity73 , an investigation running in parallel with a police inquiry into alleged phone hacking by the media , @entity0 's @entity70 said			2
the five journalists , aged 45 to 68 , were arrested at their homes in @entity0 , @entity82 and @entity83 on suspicion of corruption , aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office , and conspiracy in relation to both offenses , police said			2
their arrests followed those of four current and former @entity7 employees two weeks earlier in connection with the same investigation			2
allegations of payoffs to public officials by @entity7 employees threaten to bring the @entity18 crisis across the @entity99 to the @entity100 , where the @entity101 prevents companies from paying bribes overseas			1
" at the moment it appears he is ready to sacrifice the journalists and journalism in @entity0 to do whatever it takes to be seen to be cleaning up his act there so that it will play better in the @entity100 , " @entity104 , a former editor of @entity2 paper , @entity106 , told @entity1 thursday			1
" the consequence of that is quite amazing -- @entity7 , which is the most loyal newspaper @entity2 has ever owned -- now believes it is being hung out to dry and the @entity7 journalists are turning against them			1
" @entity2 's @entity18 interests only represent a $ 1.6 billion slice of his $ 32 billion @entity10 empire , which includes movie studio @entity123 , the @entity124 and @entity125 , as well as @entity127 and @entity128 newswires			1
" this is for @entity2 no longer about journalism			2
this is about defending @entity10 , his @entity100 based parent company , from judicial action and investigation in the @entity100 , " @entity104 said			1
such actions could put broadcast operations , the most profitable part of the @entity10 operations , in jeopardy , said @entity138 of @entity139 in @entity140			0
" if it can be proven that anybody working for @entity10 bribed or gave money to an official of a foreign government -- i.e. the @entity18 -- that 's a clear violation and the @entity147 will start the wheels in motion , and i think that 's what @entity2 has been gearing up for in the past few months , " @entity138 said			1
following the arrests , @entity2 , chairman and ceo of @entity10 , assured an executive he would continue to own and publish @entity7 newspaper , according to an internal staff memo sent by @entity40 chief executive @entity157			1
@entity157 also said he was " very saddened " by the arrests of deputy editor @entity159 , picture editor @entity160 , chief reporter @entity161 , chief foreign correspondent @entity162 and @entity163 , who is a news editor			0
analysis : @entity165 - and journalism - on the line @entity10 said in a statement last saturday that it " remains committed to ensuring that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past will not be repeated			0
" @entity10 's @entity173 , set up in the wake of the scandal that engulfed the @entity36 tabloid , provided the information to police that led to the arrests			2
the move prompted fury among many reporters at the paper			0
@entity184 , associate editor of @entity7 , wrote a column monday in which he said the paper 's journalists were being subjected to a " witch - hunt			1
" " @entity7 is not a ' swamp ' that needs draining			0
nor are those other great @entity40 titles , the @entity106 and the @entity192 , " he wrote			0
" yet in what would at any other time cause uproar in @entity195 and among civil liberty and human rights campaigners , its journalists are being treated like members of an organized crime gang			0
" he said it was right police inquiries are carried out separately from the journalists under investigation			0
but he added : " it is also important our parent company , @entity10 , protects its reputation in the @entity100 and the interests of its shareholders			1
but some of the greatest legends in @entity213 have been held , at least on the basis of evidence so far revealed , for simply doing their jobs as journalists on behalf of the company			0
" @entity2 may be hoping his visit to @entity0 will lessen the anger felt by staff at @entity7 , @entity18 's best - selling newspaper			1
editor @entity223 has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million			0
the arrests of the @entity7 employees comes after @entity2 - owned newspaper @entity36 was alleged to have hacked into private voice mails of a wide range of public officials , celebrities and victims of crime			1
the phone - hacking scandal prompted @entity2 's son , @entity10 executive @entity236 , to shut down @entity36 in july			1
the best - selling @entity18 newspaper was 168 years old			0
so far , @entity10 and its subsidiary companies have paid more than $ 200 million in legal fees and settlement of 59 of 60 lawsuits filed over phone hacking claims			2
@entity236 is facing new e-mail evidence that would have made him aware of widespread phone - hacking at the newspaper			0
the younger @entity2 has appeared twice before @entity18			0
lawmakers and said he had no knowledge of the practice			0
@entity1 's @entity250 and @entity251 contributed to this report .			0

if claims of bribery are proven , @entity2 's @entity10 could run afoul of @entity100 law
@entity2 tells @entity7 staff he is proud of them , but illegal activities " can not be tolerated "
a sunday edition of @entity7 newspaper will launch " very soon , " @entity2 says
@entity2 's visit to @entity7 's @entity0 offices follows the arrest of five journalists
