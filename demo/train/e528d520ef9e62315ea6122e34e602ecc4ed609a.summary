@entity1 @entity0 has sought advice from dozens of people over the past several months in the run up to a likely presidential bid , but one such source stands out from the rest : sen. @entity9			1
@entity13 has reached out to the @entity15 senator " several times " over the past six months , a source with knowledge of @entity13 's plans told @entity2 on tuesday , a sign of how important @entity19 's wing of the @entity21 party is to the foundation of a would - be presidential bid for the former secretary of state			1
the two met privately at the former secretary of state 's @entity1 home in december , according to the source , and have talked on the phone , as well			1
the @entity30 first reported the december meeting on tuesday			1
" secretary @entity13 really values senator @entity19 and has reached out several times over the past six months , " the source added			1
the senator 's office has not responded to questions about the meeting			0
the @entity13 - @entity19 relationship is part of the former first lady 's months - long process of soliciting ideas and seeking advice from leading @entity21 as she prepares for an all - but - certain 2016 run			1
since the 2014 midterms , @entity13 has prepared for 2016 by meeting and talking with top @entity21 about the strategy , tactics and policy that would make a possible @entity13 run in 2016 campaign successful			1
but the meetings and phone calls are also seemingly an attempt by @entity13 to satisfy what has been persistent calls from the left for the 2016 @entity21 nominee to focus on income inequality , @entity60 reform and raising up the middle class			2
@entity19 , who is seen as the heart and soul of the @entity21 left on those issues , has been the focus of a few draft campaigns since the 2014 midterms			2
left leaning groups like @entity69 and @entity70 , as well as the new @entity19 campaign , have knocked @entity13 's centrism and created sometimes negative headlines for the @entity21 frontrunner			2
although the senator has repeatedly disavowed the efforts and said she will not run for president in 2016 , she will undoubtedly direct some of the presidential conversation from her perch in the @entity81 and if they are not satisfied and courted , her supporters could continue to be an annoyance for @entity13			0
@entity84 , the ready for @entity19 campaign manager , said tuesday that the meeting is another sign @entity13 " is among a growing number of @entity21 leaders who admire " @entity19 's liberal positions			1
" this is why we 're calling on @entity19 to run for president in 2016 -- so that we have a real @entity21 primary debate about the issues that matter , and so voters can get behind a fearless champion for working families , " @entity92 added			2
the @entity101 meetings and calls also show growth in a relationship that looked awkward in 2014			0
while campaigning for @entity15 ' @entity21 gubernatorial candidate in october , @entity13 was effusive in her praise for @entity19 , labeling her " the passionate champion for working people and middle class families			0
" " i love watching @entity9 , " @entity13 added , touting her ability to " you know , give it those who deserve to get it			0
" @entity19 , however , was n't so effusive and barely mentioned the former secretary of state who was headlining the event			0
" happy to welcome secretary @entity13 back to the commonwealth , " @entity19 said , firing up the crowd			0
" we love it ! " the senators endorsing @entity0			0

@entity0 has reached out to @entity9 " several times " over the past six months , says a source with knowledge
this relationship *included* a december meeting and a phone call between the two @entity21 leaders
