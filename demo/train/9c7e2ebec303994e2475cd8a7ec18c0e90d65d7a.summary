-- he has been ridden by pop star @entity2 , actor @entity1 has performed cabaret on him in a casino and he had his life saved by the last @entity8 prime minister			1
meet @entity8 equine superstar @entity9			1
' @entity10 ' , as he is affectionately known , initially entered the @entity8 psyche when he was first past the post in the @entity13 , the race that stops a nation 21 years ago , his last ever outing			1
as only the fifth grey horse to win one of horse racing 's most prestigious races and the first since @entity22 , he was instantly a hit			1
but his celebrity status has very much come in retirement , much of it down to his myriad of public appearances from tv shows to schools and charity events			2
in all he has raised an estimated $ 10.4 million for charity during the past two decades			1
with the exception of @entity39 , mention some of the most famous @entity8 horses to their countrymen , names such as @entity34 , @entity35 or @entity36 , and non-racegoers will stare at you blankly			1
mention @entity9 , and the recognition is immediate			1
for those 21 years of retirement , he has been owned by @entity13 clerk of the course @entity47 , and once more the prestigious grey will be paraded at @entity49 in front of his adoring public when the 2013 version of the classic race takes place on tuesday			1
" people love him because he 's a grey and that 's obviously a rarity , then there 's the @entity13 win but then there 's the fact he 's such a character , he 's so likeable , " @entity47 told @entity0			1
" basically , he 's everyone 's mate ; he 's the people 's horse			2
he 's an absolute hero in @entity8			1
" that was n't always the case			0
ironically for such a tame beast , he used to be an edgy horse but @entity47 spent a year with him gaining his trust , and making him comfortable with the public			0
that teaching involved ' @entity10 ' being blindfolded and @entity75 , laden with a bucket of carrots , calling for him to come to him			0
that trust was quickly built up and his owner admits he will follow him anywhere , however bizarre			0
and there have been some bizarre locations , from a lift at the prestigious @entity83 to an airplane			0
he is so relaxed around the @entity85 , he even takes part in family meals ... on occasion			0
" he 's got his own three - acre paddock and when we have a barbeque , he comes up , likes to have a chat , nod his head , have some lettuce and carrots , and maybe have a stubbie [ an @entity8 term for a beer ]			1
" he 's a right character			2
you ask him a question and he 'll answer you with a nod of the head			0
if there 's a seat , he 'll even sit down and have a chat with you			2
" part of the family you would imagine that @entity47 would have to have parted with some serious money to take ownership of @entity9 but , in truth , all it cost for him to take him for good was a solitary @entity8 dollar			1
@entity47 had been promised the horse for that cut price amount prior to the @entity13 victory but , following that win , did he ever worry that the deal would n't go ahead ? " i remember when he won thinking ' @entity123 , i 'm not going to get him now ' , " reveals @entity47			1
" but i was told i had a better chance than ever as the handicap would be too much for him			0
i guess i always knew it would be ok as @entity128 [ his trainer ] had made a promise of the price and he 's always true to his word			2
" there are those that have tried to buy him since , notably two @entity137 sheiks , who both made separate offers to purchase @entity9 on the spot while on a trip to the @entity141 to coincide with the @entity143 horse race			1
@entity47 reminisces : " this guy came up to me and said ' right here , right now , i 'll swap him for a brand new @entity145 '			0
i said ' no ' and the guy said ' not a small @entity145 , one of the big ones ' but i explained ' he 's not for sale			2
' " then this other guy tried to buy him for $ 100,000			2
i explained i would n't sell him for any money			0
he 's too good a mate , and anyway it 'd be like selling my daughter			2
" @entity47 's daughter , at 19 , is a newer addition to the family than @entity9 , and as a result " he 's very much part of the family "			1
there have been times when there have been fears of losing this revered family member			0
' @entity10 ' has had some occasional bouts of bad health , including a recent one			0
the prospect of the horse 's possible death , forces @entity75 to tears			0
" sorry , i get pretty emotional thinking about that , " he says , his voice cracking			0
" i just hope i go before him			0
" @entity9 's most serious problems came in 2009 when chronic arthritis took hold on his aging bones			1
@entity47 managed to rectify the problem with an @entity182 medication called @entity183 and the introduction of it to @entity9 's diet immediately rectified the problem			1
but a problem occurred when the next batch of medicine was refused entry into @entity8 because of insufficient paperwork			1
@entity47 persevered but failed to get that overturned , his condition deteriorated and there was talk of him being put down			0
it led to such a public outcry and the intervention of then prime minister @entity199			1
" i knew the then attorney general @entity200 and so mentioned it to him , " says @entity47			0
" then the permit i needed appeared suddenly			0
i rang to thank him but he explained the prime minister was the one that kicked up a fuss and got it sorted			1
" it has allowed @entity9 to return to what , seemingly , he loves best -- namely entertaining his adoring fans , of which there is a long and varied list			2
" i had some lads come up to me and ' @entity10 ' the other day , " says @entity47			0
they said they remember him coming to their school when he was kids			0
and then there 's the sick kids in hospital whose faces light up when they see him			0
he 's affected a lot of people 's lives			0
" some of @entity8 's brightest stars have even grown enamored after coming face to face with the equine superstar			1
" i remember doing a charity thing at the casino with @entity1 , " says @entity47 looking back			1
" i remember he said to me ' am i going to be ok on him ? ' i was like ' he 'll be a lot better than those horses you rode in that film @entity8			2
' " @entity1 's a big , big star but even he had to admit that he people were taking more photos of ' @entity10 ' than they were of his cabaret			1
" it was the same with @entity2			2
she was with him at the @entity244 some years back			2
ok , she was n't the global star she is now then but she was still a massive star in @entity8			1
she said ' i 'm not used to being upstaged by a horse			0
' " his brush with celebrity , in fact , has only endured one rare blip , when he ate the $ 600 hat of the socialite @entity254			0
" i 've not had one problem , from having a family of four on his back , to getting on a plane or being patted by kids in a hospital , he 's done it all without a fuss , " adds @entity47			2
his feats have been enough to warrant his own race meeting , held in @entity264 in october , and all manner of adulation , which with his health restored looks likely to continue for many more years .			0
