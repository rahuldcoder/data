-- the @entity1 has secured commitments from some of the nation 's largest companies for a plan to boost hiring of the long - term unemployed			1
" what we have done is to gather together 300 companies , just to start with , including , some of the top 50 companies in the country , companies like @entity14 , and @entity15 , @entity16 and others , to say let 's establish best practices , " president @entity8 told @entity0 chief @entity10 correspondent @entity9 in an exclusive interview			1
" because they 've been unemployed ... so long , folks are looking at that gap in the resume and they 're weeding them out before these folks even get a chance for an interview , " said @entity8			1
as the economy slowly recovers from the recession , the number of workers who have not found a job for at least six months or more has grown			0
" do not screen people out of the hiring process just because they 've been out of work for a long time , " said the president			2
he will make the formal announcement on friday			0
he 's convening ceos and others who have committed to the plan			2
the move is in line with @entity8 's @entity50 push to take executive action on initiatives that he does not need @entity54 to accomplish			1
the president proposed in 2011 that @entity54 prohibit discrimination based on unemployment at companies with more than 15 workers			1
bills were introduced in the @entity61 and @entity1 , but little progress was made			0
" will we be able to have more of an impact if we can get @entity54 , for example , to pass a minimum wage law that applies to everybody , as opposed to me just through executive order making sure that , folks who are contractors to the federal government have to pay a minimum wage ? absolutely , " said @entity8			1
on tuesday , he promised to take action raising the minimum wage for government contract workers to $ 10.10 per hour			0
the nation 's unemployment rate fell to 6.7 % in december , but the drop came mainly from workers leaving the labor force			0
roughly 4 million people are considered long - term unemployed , those out of work for 27 weeks or more			1
efforts backed by @entity8 to extend a federal program providing jobless benefits to that group fell flat this month in @entity54			2
weak job growth @entity8 added that his administration will continue reaching out to the @entity1 and @entity61 on key initiatives			2
" but i 'm not going to wait for them , " the president said			0
critics have said @entity8 's push for executive action illustrates diminished expectations			1
but he stressed key accomplishments achieved through @entity54 during his five years in office , including health care and education			0
" in no way are my expectations diminished , or my ambitions diminished			0
but what is obviously true , is we 've got divided government right now			0
the @entity108 , in particular , have had difficulty rallying around any agenda , much less mine			0
and in that kind of environment , what i do n't want is the @entity116 people to think that the only way for us to make big change is through legislation , " @entity8 said			0
companies to pledge help for long - term jobless in a separate interview , rep. @entity124 , the 2012 @entity125 vice presidential candidate and a potential @entity1 hopeful next time around , told @entity9 that @entity8 appears to be circumventing the @entity127 with an " end run " around @entity54			1
" if there 's something he thinks needs to be changed in law , then he needs to make the case to @entity54 , " @entity124 said , noting that there is an " effective way " to use the bully pulpit " to encourage good things			1
" @entity0 's @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			2
