@entity0 -- federal safety officials want the @entity3 to immediately ground a type of small sports aircraft , saying six of the planes have broken up in flight in the past three years , killing 10 people			1
the @entity10 questions the safety of the @entity12			1
in an urgent letter to the @entity3 , the head of the @entity10 says there is " substantial circumstantial evidence " that aerodynamic " flutter " preceded some , if not all , of the fatal accidents , and that more accidents are likely to occur if action is n't taken			2
flutter is a condition in which airflow around the plane causes unsafe structural vibrations			0
the vibrations can quickly cause the plane to break up if it is not sufficiently dampened , the safety board said			1
the aircraft involved is the @entity12 , a single - engine , two - seater that was designed by @entity30 it is built by various manufacturers and also sold as a kit			1
in making its recommendation , the safety board said it reviewed six fatal accidents , including crashes in @entity37 and the @entity38 , and said flutter is the likely cause of the accidents			1
the board said it also considered other incidents that did not result in deaths			0
the @entity10 said two other countries , the @entity38 and the @entity46 , have grounded the aircraft			0
the @entity3 had no immediate response to the safety board 's recommendation			1
a @entity30 official did not immediately return a reporter 's phone call			2
but the @entity10 letter says @entity30 contends that the flutter problem can be addressed by proper cable tension , and asserted that a november 2005 certification flight test confirmed the plane is protected from flutter			1
but the safety board said the type of testing used may not be adequate to uncover all susceptibility to flutter			2
the @entity10 said the @entity3 certified the @entity12 as a @entity64 in 2005			1
this type of certification does not require that the @entity3 approve the airplane 's design			0
instead , the airplane model is issued an airworthiness certificate if the manufacturer asserts that the plane meets industry - accepted design standards and has passed a series of ground and flight tests			0
the safety board is asking the @entity3 to prohibit further flight of the @entity79 until the board can determine that the airplane is no longer susceptible to aerodynamic flutter			1
" the @entity10 does not often recommend that all airplanes of a particular type be prohibited from further flight , " @entity10 acting chairman @entity83 said in writing comments			0
" in this case , we believe such action will save lives			0
" unless the safety issues with this particular @entity12 model are addressed , we are likely to see more accidents in which pilots and passengers are killed in airplanes that they believed were safe to fly			0
" the safety board also found that the stick - force gradient -- a measure of the force applied to the control stick and the increase in lift that results -- was not uniform throughout the range of motion , particularly at high vertical accelerations or increased gravitational forces			2
the lessening of the gradient at high gravitational force could make the airplane susceptible to being inadvertently over-controlled by the pilot , which could create a condition in which the airplane is stressed beyond its design limits , leading to an in - flight structural failure			0
