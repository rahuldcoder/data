@entity0 -- supporters of the @entity3 hope to revive the law in a new @entity5 after efforts to renew it failed in the last one			1
" it is an early priority for us , " @entity9 minority leader @entity8 , @entity10 , told @entity1 as the 113th @entity5 convened thursday			1
" since it passed the @entity15 last time , with two more democrats in the @entity15 , we hope that it will have an easy path there and a doable path there -- and a successful one in the @entity9			1
" the @entity3 mostly provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims			1
criminal prosecutions of abusers are generally the responsibility of local authorities , but the act stiffened sentences for stalking under federal law			0
supporters credit the 1994 act with sharply reducing the number of lives lost to domestic violence over the past two decades			1
baseball player charged after domestic dispute the @entity15 voted to renew the act for a third time in april , barring agencies that receive funding under the law from discriminating against gays and lesbians , allowing immigrants who face domestic violence to seek legal status and giving tribal authorities new power to prosecute cases on @entity51 reservations			1
the @entity52 - led @entity9 passed its own bill , one that did n't include those provisions and that advocates said rolled back some protections in existing law			1
the @entity9 threatened to veto it , and no resolution was reached before the clock ran out on lawmakers this week			2
the failure to reauthorize the act leaves people such as @entity66 , executive director of the @entity67 , facing the prospect of layoffs at her organization and others that work with spousal abuse victims			0
@entity66 said the act funds the paycheck of one of her group 's nine employees and others in towns around the state			0
" we have no state money that supports domestic violence or sexual violence programs , " @entity66 said			1
the money already in the pipeline is running out , she said -- and without federal support , " we have no services here			0
" @entity88 : stop and think , @entity89 the @entity91 to end sexual and @entity92 says the failure to reauthorize the @entity3 does n't mean the law is dead -- " @entity3 itself is very much alive and will continue in its 2005 version , " it notes			1
but the programs it supports " are certainly threatened because the budget crises at the local , state and national levels are always looming			0
" the standoff over the so - called fiscal cliff put off across - the - board cuts to those programs , according to the task force , a coalition of civil rights groups other advocates			0
but without further action , it says nearly 200,000 people could lose help they now receive			0
opinion : do n't gut the @entity3 @entity116 's @entity115 - based organization supports shelters and programs across @entity119			2
federal money supports legal aid for victims facing custody , housing , employment or immigration problems and training for police , prosecutors and probation officers involved in domestic violence cases , she said			2
other programs under the @entity3 pay for court programs aimed at curbing abuse			2
the existence of federal law " drew incredible attention to the issue " and spurred states to toughen their own laws on spousal abuse and sexual assault , @entity66 said			0
it means protective orders cross state lines -- an important issue in a state where metropolitan areas such as @entity150 and @entity151 straddle the borders			0
@entity66 said changes included in @entity15 bill " bubbled up from the field " based on years of experience by women 's advocates , prosecutors , judges and social workers -- " literally thousands of people providing input into what the major problems were out here in the country			2
" " we 've now had a number of years to look at what the needs are , and the field was telling our federal legislators , ' this is what we need , ' " she said			0
opinion : @entity9 @entity52 failed women on @entity3 the @entity15 bill passed 68 - 31 , with the support of 14 republicans			1
the 222 - 205 vote on the @entity9 bill was more of a party - line affair , with only six @entity183 supporting it and 23 @entity52 voting against it			1
the @entity9 bill failed to extend the power of @entity187 tribes to prosecute offenses committed by non-indians on tribal lands , which the @entity5 said allows abusers to " game the system " and avoid prosecution			1
talks extended into late december , with vice president @entity196 -- the architect of the 1994 law -- and @entity9 majority leader @entity199 , @entity200 , attempting unsuccessfully to reach a deal			2
@entity199 spokeswoman @entity202 told @entity1 the majority leader " has been working with our members , vice president @entity196 and groups who serve those directly affected by these crimes to seek common ground across party lines and put an end to violence against women			0
" she pointed to a letter from the task force praising @entity199 's " good - faith efforts " to find a resolution			0
but the letter also said the task force remains committed to keeping the language involving tribal courts			0
and @entity8 said the @entity9 bill " was really a step backward for women			1
" @entity1 's @entity224 in @entity0 and @entity225 in @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
