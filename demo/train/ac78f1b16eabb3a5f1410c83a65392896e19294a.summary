-- writing this article is tough			2
sunday we all lost a great friend , @entity3 , in what was the most horrendous crash i have ever seen			1
this day was supposed to be a celebration , not a tragedy			1
the event at @entity9 marked the end of our @entity12 season and was to have determined the season champion			2
as a side story , @entity3 was entered in the @entity15 $ 5 million challenge , which -- if he could win the race from starting last -- could have won $ 2.5 million for him and $ 2.5 million for a fan			1
it was a challenge that garnered much media attention , and @entity3 had spent the past month or so heavily promoting the event and describing how excited he was to take part in this challenge			1
@entity9 is a fast racetrack that is high banked , and @entity12 reach speeds of 225 mph			2
danger is part of our sport			0
we all know it is ever present , and we face it every time we step in the race car			0
we push it to the back of our minds because as drivers we have a job to do and you can not let fear get in the way			1
one would be crazy to think nothing could ever go wrong , but we must not allow such thoughts to distract us from the job at hand			0
only a handful of laps into sunday 's 300 - mile race , i was following a couple of car lengths back from @entity3			1
going into turn one , i saw a couple of cars touch wheels up ahead and immediately began attempting to slow the car down from more than 220 mph			0
the racetrack in front of me began to fill with smoke and debris			0
i saw cars fly up into the air and drivers pile up into one another			1
while slowing the car , i got hit from behind and saw fellow driver @entity66 barrel roll over the top of my head and fly about 200 feet through the air , straight into the wall			1
my car came to a rest , and fortunately i jumped out unhurt			0
the scene around me was something out of a war movie			0
debris everywhere , cars burning to the ground and other drivers standing at the side of the racetrack in total shock , like myself , after having jumped out of their cars			1
as we got into the medical car that takes the drivers to the infield care center , we knew @entity3 's crash was the most severe and that it looked like he was injured			1
honestly , death never crossed my mind			0
broken bones and other serious issues , yes			0
@entity94 , no. leaving the medical center , my wife said to me , " it 's really bad , really bad			0
" suddenly the fear of losing @entity3 began to overwhelm me and all the others around me			1
only a short while later , drivers were called to a meeting and told that our greatest fear was a reality			1
@entity3 was a friend to all , a kind , charismatic man who could instantly light up a room with his beaming smile and charm			1
he was a great husband and wonderful father to his two young boys			0
his family meant everything to him			1
the question surrounds us as to why this happened			2
was the racetrack too unsafe ? honestly , i do n't have the answer to those questions			0
is our job worth the risk ? when you think of @entity3 's wife and children left behind , the answer is simple			1
no. but coming into this race you could argue that the risks are so remote that it was worth the risk to do what we love			0
injury is possible , but we just have n't seen a death in the sport for a long time , and huge safety improvements have been made			0
sunday we learned the hard truth : that no matter how much we can improve safety and plan for all eventualities , some things are impossible to prepare for			0
i think over this off - season we will evaluate what went wrong and how we can prevent this from happening again			0
and mark my words , we will learn from this			0
from my point of view as a driver , now is not that time			2
now is the time to remember @entity3 , the great champion he was -- a two - time @entity152 winner , the great husband , father and friend to so many of us			1
we will all miss him			0
no one can be blamed for this accident			2
it is just that , an accident			2
we will learn and improve , but we will not blame			0
this is what we do as drivers			2
@entity3 is a legend of our sport , one of the greats			1
his impact on my career as a fellow @entity171 driver has been profound			2
he touched everyone he met and was truly one of the most special human beings to walk this @entity175			0
now is the time to mourn the loss of @entity3 , the loss of a champion , the loss of a friend			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

driver @entity184 lost friend @entity3 on a day meant for celebration , not tragedy
he says drivers know racing is risky but try not to be distracted by this thought
@entity184 : @entity3 was a family man beloved by all
after mourning , drivers will look at how this accident happened , he says
