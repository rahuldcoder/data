some important lessons and grudge matches of the just - concluded government spending battle , and some faces to watch as we move into 2015 and 2016 -- those topics filled our trip around the " @entity8 " table sunday			2
@entity9 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			2
in losing , did @entity14 lay down an important 2015 marker ? liberals did n't like the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that passed saturday night for a host of reasons , most notably provisions that eased some restrictions on big banks and allowed big political contributors to give even more money			2
so they protested -- loudly -- about the details and the process , including venting anger that president @entity30 was supporting the compromise			2
@entity32 rep. @entity32 at one point said members were being " blackmailed			0
" in the end , liberals lost			0
but @entity37 of the @entity38 reports @entity14 are hoping the president takes notice , and perhaps grows more willing to use his veto pen in battles with the new @entity44 @entity43 in 2015			1
" they were able to keep together enough @entity14 to show that they could sustain a presidential veto , if indeed one is needed , " explained @entity37			0
" that was a big subtext of what they were doing this past week : to show that next year , ' you 're gon na need us , so just remember that as you look at what 's coming down the pipeline from @entity44 , you ca n't take @entity58 @entity14 for granted , ' " continued @entity37 , adding that @entity30 will need the @entity14 to roll back some of the things the @entity44 wants to do to with his agenda			1
sorry senator , no perks for you the @entity62 is a place of time - honored tradition			1
well , it used to be			0
recent days have been full of accounts about how freshman sen. @entity67 of @entity68 surprised his @entity44 leadership with his actions during the spending debate			1
in the old days , senators would at least give their leaders a heads up when they planned to make a point			0
and @entity76 of the @entity77 took us inside another example of the changing times			0
@entity14 sen. @entity81 of @entity82 , by virtue of his tenure , holds the largely ceremonial post of president pro tempore of the @entity62			1
in the old days , when control shifted to the other party , it was usually the case that some of that position 's perks ( like a car and driver ) would be left in place			0
but @entity44 leader @entity97 of @entity98 has some issues with @entity81 , and @entity76 detailed a bit of inside maneuvering to make a point			1
" the reason ? because @entity104 has stood in the way as a member of the @entity107 of allowing even more changes to campaign finance laws that @entity110 wanted to be added to the bill , " said @entity76			1
" so a little bit of petty fighting only over about $ 200,000 at the most , but it did n't happen -- so @entity81 loses all the trappings of the office , " @entity76 added			1
the junior senator from @entity118 is worth watching @entity119 is in the middle of some interesting debates these days , and is someone worth watching as both parties deal with the new dynamics of @entity43 and the run - up to the 2016 presidential campaign			1
@entity119 is the junior senator from @entity118 , a former @entity14 governor and one - time close ally of @entity30			1
but he is at odds with the administration over its approach to @entity132 , and @entity133 of the @entity77 told us that is n't the only big political debate where we should keep an eye on @entity119			0
" it 'll be interesting to see how he elevates his profile and builds his portfolio over these next months			0
he was a ' no ' vote in terms of @entity144 returning to leadership ... and in some ways , he 's with the party on @entity149 , things like that , but he 's also been sort of critical of this move to @entity154 , " explained @entity141 , adding that we should look for @entity119 in 2016			0
" certainly , if @entity155 runs , he might be on that short list for @entity157 as he was for @entity30 in 2008			0
off to @entity161 , for @entity158 and a @entity160 rival looking to make his mark @entity158 of the @entity77 is off to @entity161 in the days ahead , and not for some farm state holiday shopping			0
or not just for that reason , anyway			0
he 's reporting on the latest visit of sen. @entity166 of @entity82 , an @entity167 who caucuses with the @entity14 and is gearing up for the 2016 presidential nominating contest			2
most democrats think @entity155 is the runaway favorite , and many liberals who like @entity166 are openly wishing sen. @entity173 of @entity174 will join the race			2
but @entity158 smartly notes there is good reason to keep an eye on @entity166			0
" i think @entity166 looks at what 's happening in the party with sen. @entity181 , with his own efforts against banks , and he thinks yes , he 's a long - shot contender , but because he 's out there giving speeches , really engaging with a lot of the core @entity14 base voters , it means he thinks he does have a shot , " said @entity158			2
more signs @entity190 is running -- including tensions with @entity192 @entity190 is sending more signs he is likely to run for president , and they are causing a reaction that has many top republicans buzzing			1
the former @entity198 governor plans to release some 250,000 emails from his two terms in office and to write a book describing how the emails detail his political philosophy			0
" he 's doing what no other potential candidate is doing -- being completely transparent and accessible , " a top @entity190 political adviser tells " @entity8			1
" make no mistake , it 's as much a message to @entity211 as it is fellow @entity44 : the @entity212 has been slow to release documents from @entity160 's days as secretary of state , and @entity190 is only too happy to draw a contrast			1
but what has republicans buzzing more than that is the repeated pot shots between @entity220 and @entity192 in the past week or so , in reports about @entity190 's political maneuvering or about his venture capital work			1
the question is whether this is genuine tension between the principals -- both @entity44 establishment favorites -- or whether this is more of a staff feud , as we still see from time to time between the 2008 @entity30 and @entity160 teams			2
" i do n't think both run , and i think @entity234 is the less likely , " says a leading @entity44 activist with ties to both the @entity190 and @entity192 camps			1
" but this back and forth will go on a while			0
" why ? " remember @entity237 and @entity238 do not get along			0
" as in top @entity192 adviser @entity239 and top @entity190 ( and onetime @entity192 ) confidant @entity238 .			1
