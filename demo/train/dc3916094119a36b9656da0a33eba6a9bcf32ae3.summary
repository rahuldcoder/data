@entity2 at least three would - be @entity1 presidential contenders have said that vaccinating children should sometimes be done on a voluntary basis , but their careful comments on the issue underscore how problematic it could be for some of them in a primary fight			0
@entity13 sen. @entity12 joined @entity15 gov. @entity14 on monday morning in asserting that the choice should be left up to the parents			1
and @entity18 highlighted comments made by former @entity21 ceo @entity20 last week defending parents ' rights on the issue			0
the scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that vaccines are needed to protect the public , and the @entity28 has provided assurances that the @entity32 " has the safest , most effective vaccine supply in history			1
" with the outbreak of the measles epidemic in december — after the disease was eradicated from the @entity32 in 2000 -- the scientific community is mobilizing to counter the " anti-vax " movement , which has grown over the past decade			1
related : @entity28 says 102 measles cases in january , most stemming from @entity40 outbreak @entity12 , in comments on conservative talk - radio show host @entity43 's show monday , said he 's " not anti-vaccine at all			1
" " but particularly , most of them ought to be voluntary , " he added			0
@entity12 cited incidents where you have " somebody not wanting to take the smallpox vaccine , and it ruins it for everybody else			1
" " i think there are times in which there can be some rules , but for the most part it ought to be voluntary , " @entity12 went on			0
" while i think it 's a good idea to take the vaccine , i think that 's a personal decision for individuals to take			1
" he also said he was " annoyed " that his kids were supposed to receive the hepatitis b vaccine as newborns , and that he had doctors space out the 10 vaccines they wanted to give his infant children over time			1
and in a later interview with @entity72 , @entity12 suggested he had seen the negative effects of vaccines that those in the anti-vax movement cite in their opposition			1
none , however , are widely supported by the scientific community , and @entity12 's office did not respond to a request for comment for details			1
" i 've heard of many tragic cases of walking , talking , normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines , " @entity12 said			1
" i 'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea			2
i think they 're a good thing			0
but i think the parents should have some input			0
" @entity14 also took a measured approach , saying that while he vaccinates his own children , parents should be able to choose			1
" all i can say is that we vaccinate ours			0
i think it 's much more important as a parent than as a public official , and that 's what we do , " he told reporters during his trip to @entity99 on monday			2
he went on to say that 's " part of making sure we protect their health and public health			2
" " i also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice as well			0
so that 's a balance the government has to decide , " @entity14 added			1
asked whether he was advocating leaving parents the option to not vaccinate their kids , @entity14 said " i did n't say i 'm leaving people the option , " but that " it depends what the vaccine is , what the disease type is and all the rest			1
" " and so we have to have that conversation			0
[ it ] has to move and shift to disease type			0
not every vaccine is created equal			2
not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others , " @entity14 said			1
he went on to say that the debate over whether to vaccinate children should measure " whatever the perceived danger by the vaccine is — and we 've had plenty of that over a period of time — versus what the risk to public health is			2
" shortly after @entity14 's comments were picked up by national media , his spokesman , @entity146 , issued an email clarifying the governor 's position , asserting that states should have jurisdiction over the issue , as they currently do			1
" the governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated			1
at the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination , which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate , " he said			0
@entity14 's careful dance on the issue reflects the potential political trouble brewing over the question of whether parents should vaccinate their children			1
the @entity176 knocked @entity14 for putting on a " tin foil hat " and " bowing to junk science , " warning him to " sit down and shut up , before people actually get hurt " in a release			1
another group of potential 2016ers also weighed in on the need for children to be vaccinated			0
@entity187 ' sen. @entity186 told reporters tuesday that " children of course should be vaccinated " and also jumped to @entity14 's defense , a potential foe for the @entity1 nomination			1
" this issue is largely silliness stirred up by the media , " @entity186 said			0
" nobody reasonably thinks @entity14 is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines			1
" @entity186 added in a statement that vaccines " have tremendous public health benefits			2
" " but on the question of whether kids should be vaccinated , the answer is obvious , and there 's widespread agreement : of course they should			1
we vaccinate both our girls , and encourage all parents to do the same , " @entity186 said			0
sen. @entity214 of @entity215 , who is also weighing a presidential run , was unequivocal : children should " absolutely " be vaccinated and the practice should " absolutely " be mandatory , he said tuesday			0
@entity214 added to the heap of doctors and experts who assert there is no link between vaccinations			0
and unvaccinated people , @entity214 added , put infants at risk			0
" if enough people are not vaccinated you put at risk infants that are three months of age or younger that have not been vaccinated , and you put at risk immune - suppressed children that are not able to get those vaccinations , " @entity214 said			0
" so absolutely , all children in @entity32 [ should be vaccinated ]			1
" gov. @entity237 said in a statement tuesday he has " no reservations " about the benefits of vaccines and urged " all parents to get their kids vaccinated			1
" " there is a lot of fear mongering out there on this			0
i think it is irresponsible for leaders to undermine the public 's confidence in vaccinations that have been tested and proven to protect public health , " @entity237 said			2
" science supports them and they keep our children safe from potentially deadly but preventable diseases			0
personally , i would not send my kids to a school that did not require vaccinations			2
" president @entity262 weighed in on the issue during a sunday interview with @entity265 , urging parents to get their kids vaccinated			2
" i understand that there are families that , in some cases , are concerned about the effect of vaccinations , " he said			0
" the science is , you know , pretty indisputable			0
we 've looked at this again and again			0
there is every reason to get vaccinated , but there are n't reasons to not			0
" but despite @entity262 's insistence that the science supporting the need for vaccines is " indisputable , " the vaccine debate has been problematic for @entity1 in the past			1
former @entity187 gov. @entity287 came under fire in the primaries from opponents during his 2012 run for president for issuing an executive order that mandated all young girls must receive a vaccine that protects against some forms of cervical cancer			1
he eventually flipped on the mandate and supported the @entity187 legislature 's decision to overturn it , saying he made a mistake			2
" if i had it to do over again , i would have done it differently , " he said then			0
indeed , @entity20 , in explaining her position to @entity18 , referenced that vaccine as one worthy of " concern			2
" @entity12 decried it as well			0
she drew a distinction between " a vaccination when a girl is 10 or 11 or 12 for cervical cancer " and one for measles			2
" i certainly can understand a mother 's concerns about vaccinating a 10 - year - old , " she said			2
" i think vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense			2
i do think parents have to make those choices			0
" @entity323 contributed to this report from @entity325 .			1

@entity15 gov. @entity14 was asked about requiring vaccines , while he was visiting @entity325
the scientific community overwhelmingly endorses vaccines and the @entity28 says the @entity32 " has the safest , most effective vaccine supply in history "
@entity14 's spokesman later clarified his comment to say that @entity14 believes there 's " no question " that kids should get the measles vaccine "
