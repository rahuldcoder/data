-- if i had to pick the most important moves of 2014 , i would put @entity5 president @entity4 's flouting of international law and @entity8 security norms near the top			1
his swift annexation of @entity11 -- despite a 1994 treaty signed by @entity5 and @entity14 allies to guarantee @entity16 's territorial integrity -- as well as his military intervention and support for @entity20 separatists in eastern @entity16 have destabilized the continent			1
but @entity4 's moves on the @entity8 chessboard are now checkmating @entity5 , too			2
the year ended with the country in financial chaos , because of @entity14 sanctions over @entity16 , the falling price of oil and @entity30 missteps			1
the slavish @entity33 propaganda and the stifling of an independent press had brought nationalist fervor to fever pitch and put the majority of @entity5 behind him , but when their ruble and their living standards started to collapse by year 's end , the grumbling also started			2
how much political trouble will this spell for @entity4 ? will he double down and seek more diversionary foreign ( mis ) adventures , or will he try to address @entity5 's isolation , abide by the ceasefire he signed recently for eastern @entity16 , start getting sanctions unraveled and his economy back on track ? 2015 is a year to watch for @entity5 's next moves			1
similarly , @entity5 could also change tactics and play a constructive role in the horrendous disaster that is @entity57			1
over nearly four years of war , @entity5 has given @entity59 political cover , while @entity61 has provided most of the @entity57 leader 's military muscle			1
more than 200,000 people have now been killed , while the @entity65 says there are now more than 3.2 million registered refugees			0
and this year , there was the horrible evidence of @entity59 's torture and death squads , as reported on my show			0
after years of the @entity76 and its allies refusing to intervene in @entity57 , the big winner of 2014 in that region has been the brutal @entity78			1
the rise of @entity78 was largely ignored until it swept into @entity80 in @entity81 and started the gruesome public beadings of journalist colleagues in the summer			0
the brutal executions of @entity87 , @entity88 and aid workers @entity84 and @entity85 did serve to increase airstrikes and efforts that have somewhat halted the momentum of @entity78			0
and by the end of 2014 , a new government in @entity81 , trying to be more inclusive , had taken encouraging first steps			0
but the challenge for 2015 remains that few believe @entity78 will be stopped , that @entity81 will be saved , or that the @entity57 war will end until @entity59 leaves power , as president @entity100 demanded back in 2011			2
at the end of yet another year of war there , @entity104 , the @entity65 under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , told me the lack of a political resolution and the continuing carnage is a stain on the international community			2
in his own hemisphere , @entity100 took bold executive action and formally declared @entity116 's isolation of @entity117 to be a bankrupt policy that just has n't worked			0
after a half - century of trying to overthrow the @entity119 with things like the @entity121 , exploding cigars and even an attempt to infiltrate @entity117 's hip - hop scene , @entity100 threw up @entity116 's hands the week before @entity126 and announced the @entity76 would be changing tack			1
it would now engage with @entity117 , like allies in @entity116 , @entity130 and @entity8			0
the president said the two countries would restore diplomatic ties as well as major increases in trade and travel			0
president @entity138 , for his part , thanked @entity139 for his help in pushing the two sides together			0
however , 2015 will likely be marked by a furious backlash inside @entity143 , where @entity145 opponents can be expected to use their new majority to try to block any new @entity76 ambassador to @entity117 , refuse funding and especially refuse to lift the embargo			1
yet the question remains how much a new generation of @entity152 will appreciate this ? after all , demographics have changed , and they are much more eager to engage than their parents , grandparents and the remaining hard - liners in @entity143 .			0

@entity159 picks her big three *global* news stories for 2014
she cites the @entity5 - @entity16 *crisis* , the @entity57 *conflict* , changes in @entity76 - @entity117 relations
@entity159 : 2015 will be partly shaped by *response* to @entity5 , @entity57 , @entity117 stories of this year
