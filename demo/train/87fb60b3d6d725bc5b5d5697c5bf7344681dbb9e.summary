-- i 'm no stranger to the kind of dehumanized violence we saw happen in a @entity6 movie theater earlier this summer			0
as a hostage negotiator , i 've been held hostage myself four times in the line of duty			1
that 's never a comfortable place to be , but i kept in mind that the success rate of hostage negotiators is as high as 95 % and i knew why			1
hostage negotiators are successful because they build trust through dialogue			1
that dialogue changes the mindset of the hostage taker so he will surrender his weapons and hostages , even though he is aware he will probably go to prison			2
in essence , the hostage negotiator becomes a " secure base " to the hostage taker			1
a secure base provides a sense of safety and stretch , just as a parent , grandparent , or caretaker provides their child both protection and encouragement to go out and explore and take risks			1
today , i work mostly with corporate leaders instead of hostage takers			1
in my book " care to dare " i define a secure base as " someone or something that gives protection or sense of protection , inspires or brings forth energy within an individual			1
" with this inspiration and energy , individuals step out of their comfort zones and strive to fulfill their untapped potential			0
i believe this quality is the single most important criterion for delivering sustainable high - performance leadership			2
see also : want be a leader ? act like one many hostage takers have few secure bases in their lives			1
hostage taking is always preceded by a loss or a series of losses			2
the most dangerous hostage taker is the person who has no attachments and refuses to talk			2
however , when a hostage negotiator offers hopes , options , and positive solutions by gaining the trust of the hostage taker , he or she can become a secure base			1
to become a secure base to my hostage takers meant caring about them as people and gaining their trust to explore positive solutions both for them and their hostages			1
once i understood the motivation behind the hostage taking , i could begin the search for options			2
by tactfully leading the way and while acting as a " secure base , " i was able to disarm my four hostage takers without force			1
each time , i survived precisely because i cared for the person who had a weapon trained on me			0
that process involved creating a relationship -- an emotional bond -- with the hostage taker			0
neuroscience explains why this bonding works			0
the human brain has one goal : to survive			0
that 's why humans are always searching for the negative and instinctively act defensively			0
however , when a secure base creates a bond , the resulting sense of protection lets the brain shut down its defensive focus			1
then the brain can look for positives and opportunities			0
@entity120 , the accused shooter in the @entity123 mass murder , is a typical example of a " loner " who has no secure bases or recently lost them : his university position as student , his identity , his apartment , his girlfriend , his father , to name just a few			0
as someone with extensive experience with severely troubled people , i see his lack of secure bases as a key contributing factor to his alleged crimes			0
these days , i am a professor of leadership and organizational behavior , yet i still focus on the most basic human needs that drive behavior			0
if leaders are not secure bases to their employees , employees can not trust them and they will be defensive and even feel like hostages			1
gallup studies show extremely low rates of employee engagement : 7 % in @entity154 , 12 % in @entity155 , 17 % in the @entity156 , and 28 % in the @entity157			0
the major finding was that high engagement was connected to high emotional care from the immediate boss -- a boss who became a secure base			2
when caring was present , the employees would " dare " to take risks and stretch themselves to achieve great things			0
this winning combination of caring and daring not only shuts down defenses , it can also unleash extraordinary potential			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2
