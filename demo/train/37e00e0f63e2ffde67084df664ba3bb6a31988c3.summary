@entity0 -- federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the @entity6 accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored , the @entity3 's inspector general concluded in a report released wednesday			1
in one case , an inspector in the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company , the report states			1
others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil , with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in			1
some in the same office accepted tickets to the 2005 @entity31 , a college football bowl game in @entity34 , @entity35			2
one inspector told an office clerk , " everyone has gotten some sort of gift before at some point " from companies they regulated , according to the report			1
investigators from the inspector general 's office , the @entity3 's independent watchdog agency , took their findings to federal prosecutors in @entity15 , the report states			2
but the @entity54 attorney 's office in @entity14 declined to bring charges , according to the report			2
full coverage of the @entity6 oil spill " through numerous interviews , we found a culture where the acceptance of gifts from oil and gas companies were widespread throughout that office , " the report states			1
however , that culture waned after a supervisor in the agency 's @entity72 , @entity15 , regional office was fired for taking a gift from a regulated company in 2007 , the report found			2
the period covered in the report is well before the april explosion that sank the oil rig @entity81 , resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner @entity84 and federal authorities are trying to cap a month later			1
but @entity87 , the @entity3 's acting inspector general , said she pushed for the report 's early release in the wake of the disaster			2
" of greatest concern to me is the environment in which these inspectors operate -- particularly the ease with which they move between industry and government , " @entity92 wrote in a letter to interior secretary @entity94			1
many of the inspectors joined @entity13 from the industry and had relationships with people in the business that originated " well before they took their jobs with industry or government			1
" sen. @entity109 , @entity110 , said the report showed the agency 's safety enforcement procedures need an extensive overhaul			0
" they 're supposed to be the cops on the beat , and instead they 're out tailgating at sports events with people they 're supposed to be policing , " said @entity109 , who leads a @entity116 subcommittee on public lands			1
" that 's just not acceptable			0
" the @entity14 investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the @entity13			1
a september 2008 inspector general 's report found regulators in the agency 's @entity130 office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them			1
@entity94 , who has ordered a widespread shake - up of the agency since the @entity81 disaster in the @entity6 , called tuesday 's report " yet another reason to clean house			1
" " this deeply disturbing report is further evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of mms and the oil and gas industry , " @entity94 said in a statement on the report			1
he pledged to follow through with the inspector general 's recommendations , " including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination , discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution			0
" while the report predates the @entity81 spill , @entity94 said he has asked @entity92 to investigate whether inspectors failed to enforce standards aboard the rig			1
its sinking left 11 men lost at sea and oil spilling into the @entity6			0
@entity92 is scheduled to appear before the @entity168 on wednesday			0
@entity109 said @entity94 " is heading in the right direction " by reorganizing the agency , but he said @entity13 needs a bigger shakeup			2
" @entity172 has moved , in my view , as it relates to royalty payments and financial irregularities , " he said			0
" now he has got to come down with hobnail boots on some of these ethical violations , and drain the safety swamp			0
" @entity13 collected nearly $ 10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009			2
@entity94 announced last week that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development , enforcement and revenue collection divisions , saying they have conflicting missions			0
the associate director for the agency 's @entity190 is leaving at the end of may , a month earlier than planned , in the wake of the @entity6 spill			0
that official , @entity195 , launched the investigation that resulted in former @entity72 , @entity15 , supervisor @entity198 's firing in 2007			0
@entity198 later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts from an offshore drilling contractor valued at more than $ 6,600 , according to the report			2
@entity202 , executive director of the nonprofit @entity203 , said earlier this month that the agency has been lax about collecting royalties from an industry it sees as " a partner , a client			0
" she pointed out that @entity209 , its previous director , left at the end of the @entity213 administration to become president of the @entity215 , the trade association that represents offshore drillers			0
" that really gives you a picture of the people who have been running the shop here , " @entity217 said			0
@entity1 's @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report			0
