-- a @entity2 man who stumbled across and alerted authorities to a young girl investigators say was kept in a basement , starved and sexually abused , said tuesday she looked much younger than her 15 years -- " like she just came from @entity8			1
" @entity9 of @entity10 was on his way home from buying milk at the store when he saw what looked to be a girl , " 8 or 9 years old , " he said , outside , wearing pajamas but no shoes			1
" i thought that was odd ... so i put the car in reverse and rolled down the window and asked her if she was ok			0
she said no , she needed help , " @entity9 told @entity0 's @entity26			2
he described picking the girl up , putting her in his car , wrapping her feet in a coat and blasting the heat			0
" her eyes were set back like she was very dehydrated			0
you could see the bones in her arm ... the only way i could best describe it is she looked like she just came from @entity8 , " said @entity9			1
@entity8 was a concentration camp in @entity42 operated by the @entity43 during @entity44 they began to talk			2
soon into the conversation , he stepped outside the car , telling the girl he needed to call a friend			0
the girl 's 18 - year - old stepbrother has since been charged with three felony sexual abuse counts			1
her 40 - year - old father and 42 - year - old stepmother have been charged with child abuse and recklessly endangering a child , both felonies , as well as a misdemeanor count of child neglect			1

" mr. @entity9 was in the right place , at the right time , and did the right thing , " said @entity68			0
efforts are under way to establish a fund for the victim , who is being " well cared for , " he added			0

a doctor who examined her described her as a victim of " serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation , " the report states			0
