@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's historic drought has finally delivered its ultimate devastation : hundreds of homes in one community bone dry , devoid of tap water			1
the @entity9 farming community of @entity0 is a place where 400 homes are without running water			2
no way to wash dishes			0
that 's because private wells have run dry			2
turning the spigot is a futile exercise			0
" at first , it was dread that came over us			2
what are we going to do ? " said @entity24 , 62 , a father of five whose home has been without water for weeks			2
" we are a low - income family			0
things are hard enough as it is , trying to get everybody to school and get everybody ready			0
" the worst of the drought is tormenting the @entity37 community 160 miles north of downtown @entity38			2
in @entity0 , drinking water comes from private wells , not public utilities			2
of the community 's 7,300 residents , nearly 1,000 are without running water , county officials said			1
into this void has stepped a 71 - year - old grandmother who saw a need and responded			2
she started by buying bottled water with her own money and delivering it to a list of people -- which just kept getting longer			1
' an angel ' what began as a mission of charity by @entity57 , a retiree , is now a well - publicized relief effort , inspiring businesses and others to donate bottled water			1
" she has a big heart			0
she 's an angel , " resident @entity63 said of @entity57			2
@entity57 regularly visits @entity63 ' door to ensure that she , her 5 - and 10 - year - old girls and husband have enough water for the week , @entity63 said			2
@entity57 does the same for the elderly , the sick and anyone who needs it			0
she interrupted her retirement when she discovered just how many of her neighbors were living without running water			1
" so many people were not informed of what to do in a drought like this			1
i thought there are people who do n't speak @entity81 , people that are elderly , they 're pregnant , have diabetes , that are ill , everyday people			1
it does n't have any prejudice			2
it affects everybody from the low - income to the higher - income person , " @entity57 said			0
state of emergency @entity57 's humanitarian project comes as 100 % of @entity1 faces at least a moderate drought and more than half of the state faces the worst category of dryness , called an exceptional drought , the @entity92 says			1
@entity1 is n't the only state feeling an absence of rain			1
as of late september , 30 % of the @entity103 faced at least a moderate drought , particularly in the @entity106 states neighboring @entity1 and in @entity107 , the @entity92 says			1
but none of those states is facing the extremes of @entity1 , where the drought has been a slowly building natural disaster since 2012			1
in fact , gov. @entity112 this year declared a state emergency , saying his constituents are facing " perhaps the worst drought that @entity1 has ever seen since records ( began ) about 100 years ago			1
" on september 16 , @entity112 signed " historic legislation " that creates " a framework for sustainable , local groundwater management for the first time in @entity1 history , " the governor 's office said			1
before the new legislation , @entity1 was the only @entity127 state that did n't manage its groundwater , officials said			1
in the meantime , dramatic struggles and responses are unfolding in communities like @entity0 , whose new heroine is receiving national attention			0
with one jug of water in each arm , @entity57 moves at a frantic pace through the dust and often 100 - degree heat to deliver drinking water to as many people as possible , as fast as she can			1
she is now assisted by @entity144 , her 19 - year - old neighbor who saw how she helps people suffering from the drought			1
" it 's almost like an illness			2
it kind of spreads and all of a sudden it 's a catastrophe , and it is a disaster , " @entity57 said			2
ahead of officials without @entity57 's effort , officials say they would not have known just how many people were hurting			1
" she really helped raise awareness about how bad it was in this confined area , " @entity37 emergency services manager @entity154 said			0
many residents never thought the drought could so profoundly alter their lives			1
" you never expect it and you never want to live through this			0
it 's really hard , " 17 - year - old @entity163 said as @entity57 delivered water			1
her father , a field hand , came home one day in august and discovered there was no running water for his family of six			2
" you ca n't go to the bathroom , you ca n't take a shower , you ca n't wash dishes			0
you have to conserve every single drop , " @entity174 said			0
officials say they value @entity57 's bringing attention to the disaster because some residents simply do n't know what would happen if they told authorities about their lack of running water			1
community in fear for example , some residents worried the government would red - tag their homes and make them move			0
migrant workers worried their landlords would kick them out if they reported the problem			0
undocumented immigrants panicked about being deported if they had contact with authorities			0
authorities sought to soothe those suspicions and fears			0
" we 're not here to make things worse , " @entity154 said			0
the 400 private wells without water in @entity0 are just a fraction of the 30,000 private wells throughout @entity37 , which also includes portions of the @entity208 and the @entity209 and @entity211 national parks , officials said			0
as distressing as the empty wells are , officials are also concerned it will take a long time to restore all of them , whether empty or low			0
" the issue is we still expect this to get worse , even if we get a substantial rainfall this winter			0
a lot of the areas in the county are going to take a year or two years to recharge their water levels , " @entity154 added			0
there is no quick fix			0
a grandmother weeps homes with private wells are n't hooked up to water mains , and such a connection could take years , officials said			1
the original deal was that residents with private wells would not get a water bill but were responsible for maintaining the wells			1
that became a problem in the drought because many residents ca n't afford the thousands of dollars it takes to drill a deeper well			1
moreover , even if residents have the money , there is up to a two - year backlog to hire a company to do the job , officials said			0
in the meantime , county officials are helping residents secure grants for delivery of commercial bottled water			1
for now , the county is offering a 5,000 - gallon tank of water outside the local fire department			0
residents ca n't use that water to drink or wash dishes because it 's not potable , but they can use it for toilets , baths and laundry			1
residents show up not just with buckets but 55 - gallon drums			0
on a recent afternoon , as he filled up several jugs of water , @entity24 , the father of five whose home has been without water for weeks , called the tank a real help , but he worried about folks who do n't have transportation and are out of water			1
that is where @entity57 comes in			0
at first , she bought the bottled water with her own money and delivered it herself , but now she enjoys donations of bottled water and help from the young neighbor who was inspired by her work			1
she labors voluntarily through the heat three days a week , but the demands of one recent day proved to be overwhelming : @entity57 broke down in tears , feeling the depths of the insidious disaster			0
she finds comfort in her work , though			0
that 's because her private well has run dry , too , and she savors the kindness of donations			1
" without water , you ca n't survive , you ca n't keep your home and you ca n't keep water in it , and my heart goes out to everybody , " she said .			2

@entity1 's historic drought leaves nearly a thousand people without water
residents filled with dread when water *stopped* coming out of their taps
a grandmother ends her retirement to help out neighbors who do n't have water
she buys and delivers bottled water , inspiring donations
