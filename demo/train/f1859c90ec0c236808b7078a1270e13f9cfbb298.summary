-- @entity2 public notary @entity1 do @entity3 set off a firestorm by granting @entity2 's first civil union to a trio , an act so unprecedented that there is n't a word for it in @entity11			1
@entity12 is the label she created			0
" @entity18 union " is her best guess in @entity16			2
the relationship involves three professionals in their 30s -- one man and two women -- who , she says , live together , love one another as equals and are like any other non-married cohabiting couple -- except they are three			1
what @entity3 did was legally register the trio as a " stable union , " a civil union that extends all of the benefits of marriage , though there is debate about what rights the threesome will actually enjoy			1
in short , it recognizes the trio as a family entity for public legal purposes			1
@entity3 has not released the identities of the three			0
but not all are embracing the unique alliance			0
" this union is void of any legality , " said @entity46 , head of the family law committee of a lawyers ' association in @entity50			2
@entity2 law defines marriage as a union between two people , so it is impossible for a civil union of three to be granted the rights of a marriage of two			1
" it goes directly against the constitution , " @entity61 said			2
" @entity64 is defined as relations between two , not three or four or five			0
" the first - of - its - kind civil union has led to an outcry from religious groups , too			1
those who fear the " slipperly slope " feel the ground moving underneath their feet			0
" the institution of family can not be defended with the approval of actions that seek to distort its definition , " the religious , conservative @entity74 said in a statement			2
" the purpose of this ( union ) is not to build families , but to destroy them			2
" the controversial civil union " is proof that there is a plurality of familiar relations , though not all deserve judicial or legal standing , " @entity85 , director of the @entity86 , said in a statement			1
" the action carried out does not provide protections and does not confer rights			0
" in his opinion , the legal action in question does nothing more than reaffirm that the trio in question believes that they are a trio			0
@entity3 , 39 , argues that they deserve some benefits			0
they live together in @entity109 , they share a bank account , and they want protection in case of separation or death , she said			0
@entity2 is known for its progressive social policies and openness , as reflected in the status conferred to the trio , though the country is stereotyped , too			1
while @entity2 appears to be a permissive place , it is also a a country where more than 86 % of the population identifies as catholic or evangelical			2
there was a similar outcry when " stable unions " between same - sex couples were allowed for the first time			0
the country 's supreme court ruled that a gay couple in a civil union had the same rights as a married heterosexual couple , but there is debate about whether such rights can be extended to a trio			1
but to @entity3 , a public notary in the city of @entity144 in @entity50 state , there is nothing preventing nontraditional relationships from being granted " stable union " status			1
the trio considers themselves a family and is entitled to be seen as such in the public record , @entity3 said			1
" by registering them , i only confirmed that they recognize themselves as a family , " she said			0
" i do n't confer rights to them			0
that is up to a judge to decide			0
" the civil union was actually granted three months ago , but news of it only spread this week			1
@entity165 called the civil union " deceitful , " a runaround to grant status to a polygamous relationship			1
such relationships are n't new ; they just have n't been recognized , @entity3 said			0
she says that she simply put her stamp of approval on a relationship that was surfing on a wave of cultural currents , but it was no coincidence that the request landed on her desk			0
the trio from @entity109 , having been rejected by other public notaries , found their way rural @entity50 state and to @entity3 because she is a student of polyfidelitous relationships -- ones involving more than two partners , but where there is fidelity between the members			2
formerly an it manager , @entity3 now is a doctoral student at the @entity189 , studying family law			2
her dissertation , she said , is about " how you can love more than one person at the same time			0
" her research looks at cultures , places , sociology , anthropology , religion and the history of family and intimate relationships in @entity2			1
through mutual friends , the trio found @entity3 and traveled more than 600 miles from @entity109 , into the interior of @entity50 state , to @entity144			0
@entity3 does n't hesitate to call herself married , though she and her husband are bound by a " stable union " and not a civil marriage			2
her husband works with her as a deputy public notary			1
" we have had all the reactions you can imagine , " she said			0
other polyfidelitous groups have reached out to her seeking the same civil union status			1
@entity3 is studying the cases of a quintet ( two men and three women ) and another trio ( one woman and two men ) .			1

in @entity2 , a notary has granted a civil union to unite a man and two women
the public notary who approved the status says they have the right to be a family
others say it is a *violation* of the constitution and destroys families
the notary is now studying unions for another trio and for a quintet
