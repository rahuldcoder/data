@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 rides her motorbike across the city , goes out to dinner with @entity8 friends and has resumed her studies at a local university			1
life has made a 180 - degree turn for this 20 - year - old @entity14 woman			1
in march last year , her life was shattered by an explosion of sectarian violence between @entity18 and @entity14 in her hometown of @entity0 in central @entity1 , which left more than 40 people dead and thousands more homeless			1
@entity3 's family fled for their lives during the first of three days of rioting and spent more than a month in a shelter at a nearby sports stadium			1
violent clashes during the clashes , which reportedly erupted after a dispute between a @entity14 gold shop owner and two @entity8 sellers , rioters set fire to houses , schools , businesses and mosques			1
people were also beaten , doused with gasoline and set on fire			0
@entity0 's muslims were heavily outnumbered and suffered the bulk of the casualties			1
for more than a month , few ( if any ) @entity14 remained in their homes because they were either destroyed or it simply was n't safe for them to stay there			1
@entity3 's family was among the first group of @entity14 to return home after the worst of the violence			1
unlike others , their house was still standing			0
while some @entity14 were returning , interviews with many people across the city made it clear that trust between @entity14 and their @entity8 neighbors was broken			1
police and soldiers were now stationed on streets where @entity14 lived to protect them against further attacks			2
@entity3 's university was shut down			1
she was no longer in contact with her @entity8 friends and her parents would not allow her to go more than a short distance from their home			1
more than a year on , a return trip to the city revealed that although extremist elements remain , relations have warmed between many @entity18 and @entity14 in the community			1
" we 're close again , " @entity3 said about her relationships with @entity8 friends			1
" we spend time after classes and enjoy each other 's company now , whether we talk about movies or eat together			0
" @entity81 heals wounds her mother , @entity83 , agreed distrust has gradually given way to friendship			0
" @entity81 healed many of the wounds , " she said			0
there are no longer police or troops stationed on @entity83 's street , and her family is no longer afraid to go anywhere in the city			2
this change in attitude is not exclusive to one side of the sectarian divide			0
last year , u @entity101 , a 51 - year - old @entity8 man , told me he stopped talking to his @entity14 friends and would not even go to his usual @entity14 butcher because he was afraid his food might be poisoned			1
" now i 'd go to a @entity14 butcher and my relationships with my @entity14 friends are back to normal , " he said			2
@entity111 , a @entity14 and vice president of a local interfaith group called @entity113 , says people have not forgotten what happened but realize that it was n't necessarily their neighbors who were the main culprits behind the riots			2
he blames extremist groups , adding that when angry mobs are divided along sectarian lines , normally peaceful people can get caught up in the rage and emotion			0
he also blames the local police for not stepping in early on -- last year 's violence did n't stop until president @entity127 declared a state of emergency and called in the military after three days of rioting			1
leaders of the interfaith group acknowledge that the attitudes of some people might never change , but they insist they 're in the minority			0
" within six months many people were back to being friends , " said @entity136 , a @entity8			2
@entity136 says he 's optimistic this community can avoid a repeat of last year 's deadly riots			2
" so many of these people have lived side by side for years and have been friends for years , " he said			0
this interfaith group , made up of @entity18 and @entity14 from the community , started in may 2013 and during the course of an eight - month campaign handed out thousands of t - shirts , baseball caps and stickers with words that translate to " no religious violence because of me			1
" long - persecuted @entity155 the rekindling of friendships between @entity18 and @entity14 in @entity0 is quite different from the situation between @entity155 muslims and ethnic @entity160 in @entity1 's western @entity161			1
the @entity155 are a long - persecuted minority in @entity1 who are denied citizenship and usually are not allowed to leave @entity161			2
unlike @entity0 , where @entity18 and @entity14 live side by side , the @entity155 live in separate villages -- more than 140,000 live in camps for the displaced after their homes were destroyed in riots two years ago			1
the communal violence there also resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people			0
many @entity155 have lived in @entity1 for generations and were brought here from @entity176 when @entity1 was a @entity177 colony called @entity1			2
many ethnic @entity1 view the @entity155 as illegal intruders from what 's now @entity180 , and refuse to call them @entity155 , using the term @entity182 instead			1
but in @entity0 , where trust between @entity18 and @entity14 is being rebuilt , sections of the city remain in ruins			1
in the @entity14 majority @entity189 , there are only rocks and dirt where many homes and businesses used to stand			1
a few people , who have the financial means , have started rebuilding			0
rebuilding lives the only section of the city that has a lot of construction underway is @entity202			0
all 760 homes in the neighborhood were lost -- the majority of them belonged to @entity14 families			1
construction has started on about 350 houses			0
" i want to bring back those families who lost their homes to these new homes , " said construction project manager , @entity211 , adding that they 're building homes for @entity14 , @entity18 , @entity214 and @entity215			2
he says the government is covering the costs of building roads , water lines and utility lines , but the money to cover the estimated $ 6 million needed to replace the homes is being raised privately			0
most of the donors are @entity14 living in @entity227 , the country 's biggest city and commercial capital			1
@entity230 , which is connected to a mosque in @entity227 , is handling the fundraising and the rebuilding of @entity202			0
but @entity234 says organizers have only been able to raise half of the money they need so far			0
he says he has no idea when he 'll be able to finish the project			0
returning home @entity242 is one of the @entity202 residents who hope to go back			0
" i 'm always thinking about it , " she said			0
" she 's one of more than 5,000 people still living in shelters and camps for the displaced			0
@entity251 's shelter is for @entity14 and is on the grounds of a local university about 14 miles outside of @entity0			1
she has spent more than a year living inside a 15 by 20 foot room in a bamboo shelter without running water with her husband and two children , aged 12 and 14			0
they have to walk for a few minutes to access the nearest toilet and shower			0
@entity251 cooks the family 's meals over a tiny , charcoal barbecue , one of dozens lined in orderly rows in the camp			2
despite the tight living quarters , @entity268 says she is thankful			0
" i 'm grateful to have a safe place to stay , " she said			0
memories of the riots in @entity0 have n't faded , but many people here are cautiously optimistic about the direction things are heading			2
last year , they talked about distrust and broken bonds			0
now some of those same people discuss rebuilding the city and rekindling friendships between @entity18 and @entity14 , all the while hoping that extremists do n't find a way to divide their community again .			2
