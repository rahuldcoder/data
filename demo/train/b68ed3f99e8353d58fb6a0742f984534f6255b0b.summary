-- in what 's become an annual rite , thousands of diehard fans of @entity3 's iconic smartphone endured long overnight lines outside @entity3 retail stores around the world to be among the first friday to buy the new @entity9			1
@entity10 , 39 , had been in line at @entity12 in @entity13 since 5 p.m. thursday			2
the truck driver from @entity15 , @entity16 , said he 's done so for every iteration of the smartphone that @entity3 ceo @entity19 introduced to the world in 2007			1
" i 've been doing it since @entity22 , " @entity10 said			0
" it 's the experience more than anything			2
it just happens to be the hottest phone on the market			0
" near the front of a line of about 200 people friday morning , @entity10 said he got about an hour 's worth of sleep while meeting new friends from what he called " the @entity9 family			1
" at 8 a.m. local time across the @entity40 , thousands who spent hours waiting in line were greeted with cheers as @entity3 stores and other retailers began selling the new phone			1
more than 800 people were already in line outside the flagship glass - cube @entity47 on @entity49 in @entity50 by the time the store opened friday morning			1
dozens of people there had been in line since monday			2
initial demand for the phone , at least in the @entity40 , appears to be stronger than for previous models			0
one analyst estimated that based on counts at @entity47 in @entity50 , @entity64 and @entity65 , the lines friday were , on average , 83 % longer than those for the @entity62 last october			2
those @entity9 shoppers ( or " fanboys " and " fangirls " as they 're called by less - supportive tech enthusiasts ) in the @entity40 were n't the first , though			1
throngs of shoppers lined up outside @entity3 stores in @entity73 , @entity74 ; @entity75 ; @entity76 ; @entity77 ; and @entity78 , @entity79 , among other cities where the phone went on sale			1
hundreds of cold and tired but excited customers were lined up outside the @entity47 on @entity76 's @entity84 friday morning			1
many had been waiting outside the store all night without food or anything to sit on , but the general consensus seemed to be that the hassle had been worth it			0
" i 've been waiting since midnight , so 12 hours now , " said @entity91 , a 21 - year - old student			0
" i have n't really eaten but it was n't that cold and i 've got some tea now so it 's alright			2
" and why was his 12 - hour wait necessary ? " i 've already got the @entity62 and a @entity95 so it 's like having a collection really , " he added			0
" you just want to keep going along with it			0
" " i 'm actually from @entity101 and just missed my flight home to be here , " said another @entity76 customer , @entity100 , a 19 - year - old student			0
" i 'm not sure how much it 's going to cost me to get a new flight but seeing as the previous @entity9 was so great i definitely think it 's going to be worth it			1
" others were less excited about the overnight wait for the sixth version of @entity3 's iconic smartphone			1
" i 've been here for around 11 hours but the queue kept moving so i could n't go to sleep , " said student @entity112 , 20			0
" i had to take time off work to come here and really wish now that i 'd just ordered it online			0
" despite morning rainfall in @entity75 , hundreds of eager customers lined up outside an @entity47 in the city 's @entity123 shopping district			1
store employees handed out umbrellas to waiting customers , some of whom came sporting face paint to celebrate the occasion			0
" it 's almost like a festival , people just camping in the center of @entity123 , just drinking and playing and talking to each other , " said @entity132 , a 34 - year - old web designer			1
" it 's not really just buying the phone ; it 's just enjoying the party , really			0
" in @entity73 , customers camped out in tents and folding chairs			1
cheers erupted when the store 's doors opened			1
@entity148 told @entity0 affiliate @entity149 that he waited for more than 70 hours to get @entity74 's first @entity9 and review it online			1
announced september 12 , the @entity9 features a bigger screen , lighter and slimmer frame , faster processor and , for the first time , @entity155 wireless connections			2
if a handful of tech writers were unimpressed with the specs , that did n't translate into lack of consumer interest			0
@entity3 took 2 million pre-orders for the phone in the first 24 hours they were available last week , and some analysts said they think it could sell more than 10 million by monday			0
that first - day total was double the number of @entity62 pre-orders the company took last year , and an initial friday shipping date was quickly pushed back			0
people who pre-order the phone now , or did so in the past few days , could be waiting more than three weeks for their phones to ship			0
the phone will roll out to 22 more countries on september 28			0
