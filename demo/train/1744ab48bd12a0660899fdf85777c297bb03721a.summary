@entity0 is described by those who know him as a doctoral student who is clean - cut , quiet and responsible , an image difficult to reconcile with the same man who police allege opened fire in a crowded movie theater			1
days after the 24 - year - old was arrested on suspicion of a mass shooting at the @entity11 multiplex in @entity12 , @entity13 , the portrait of @entity0 that is emerging is as limited as it is confusing			1
pictures obtained of @entity0 show a bright - eyed young man , who is tall with dark hair , which contrasts the description of the man by a law enforcement official who said he dyed his hair red and identified himself as " the @entity22 " to authorities after he was arrested early friday morning for allegedly shooting people during a screening of the new @entity27 movie			1
remembering the victims by all accounts , @entity0 is a bright student			1

@entity30 police have no record of any contact with @entity0 , the university said			1
neither did police at the @entity45 , where @entity0 enrolled in 2011 as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program at the @entity49 in @entity12 , university officials said in a statement released sunday			1
in fact , the sole contact authorities in @entity13 appeared to have had with @entity0 was a speeding summons in 2011 , according to @entity12 police			1
a syllabus that lists @entity0 as a student at the medical school shows that he may have taken a class in which he studied topics as diverse as substance abuse , schizophrenia , depression and other disorders			1
according to the document , he was to have delivered a presentation in may about @entity67 biomarkers			0
though there are indications that something may have been amiss in @entity0 ' life in recent months			1
he withdrew from the program in june 2012 , though " he gave no reason for his withdrawal from the graduate school , " said @entity77 , spokeswoman for the @entity45			0
it is not immediately clear if @entity0 , who also worked in a paid position in the university 's neuroscience research program , was still employed there after withdrawing from the program			1
@entity0 received a large volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses , which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the rampage and the subsequent discovery of his booby - trapped apartment , @entity12 police chief @entity94			1
the police chief has declined to release details about a possible motive or @entity0 ' appearance at the time of his arrest , citing an ongoing investigation			2
but he did say @entity0 purchased four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months			2
police : evidence of ' calculation and deliberation ' in @entity13 theater shooting police allege @entity0 was dressed in black , wearing a ballistic helmet , a tactical ballistic vest , protective leggings , a throat and groin protector and a gas mask during the attack			2
witnesses to the shooting say because the gunman wore a gas mask , they did not see his face			0
unlike most people his age , @entity0 does not appear to have a social media footprint -- no @entity126 , no @entity127 and no @entity129 account , though authorities are investigating whether he posted a profile on sex website @entity132			1
the profile contains a picture of a man with fiery red hair , a law enforcement source said			1
police believe it may be a picture of @entity0 , said the source , who was not authorized to speak to the media			1
the profile said it was created by a 24 - year - old man from @entity12 and has since been taken down			2
theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media it 's a profile that contrasts with news that @entity0 worked as a counselor at a summer camp for needy children in 2008			1
camp @entity152 caters to needy children ages 7 - 14 , and is run by @entity156 @entity155 of @entity157 , which confirmed his employment but would not offer further details or comment			1
the man who grew up in the upscale northwest @entity162 neighborhood of @entity163 was renting an apartment on in @entity12 , according to police and realty records			0
@entity167 , a neighbor of the @entity0 family in @entity162 , described @entity0 as " clean - cut , quiet , responsible			2
" at the time of his arrest , @entity0 was living in a small , three story brick building on @entity173 in @entity12 , in @entity174 , within walking distance to the university			2
" neighbors report he lived alone and he kept to himself , " @entity177 said			0
a neighbor who lives one floor below @entity0 ' third - floor apartment , @entity182 , described the apartments this way : " it 's not like true ghetto			2
it 's not the safest neighborhood , but it 's definitely improving			0
" apparently , @entity0 told police during his arrest he had booby - trapped the third - floor apartment			2
@entity191 , a 20 - year - old grad student and neighbor , said she heard techno music blasting from his apartment around the time of the shooting , and had nearly opened @entity0 ' unlocked apartment door to complain , unaware that the unit was booby trapped with explosives			0
massacre suspect 's neighbor : ' i 'm counting my lucky stars ' a timer had turned the music on so that it would blare in his apartment after he left for the @entity12 multiplex , according to a law enforcement source , who also spoke on condition of anonymity			0
bomb technicians worked saturday to clear " all hazards " from the apartment , and began allowing some evacuated residents to return			0
@entity214 , who lives close to @entity0 , had a beer with him on tuesday			0
