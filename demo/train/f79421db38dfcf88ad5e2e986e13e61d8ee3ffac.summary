-- after a series of high - profile and embarrassing hacks , @entity1 has rolled out a new , two - step login to help users prevent unwanted intrusions			1
the " two - factor " verification system , which will be optional , asks users to register a phone number , e-mail account and six - digit code that would have to be entered , via text message , each time they log in to the site			2
" every day , a growing number of people log in to @entity1 , " @entity18 , of the site 's security team , said in a blog post			1
" usually these login attempts come from the genuine account owners , but we occasionally hear from people whose accounts have been compromised by email phishing schemes or a breach of password data elsewhere on the web			2
" the move comes in the wake of repeated hacks to prominent @entity1 accounts in recent months			1
last month , the @entity36 's @entity1 account was compromised by someone who falsely tweeted that there had been a bombing at the @entity40			1
it was the latest in a laundry list of media organizations hacked in recent months			0
among them : the @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , " @entity50 " and " @entity51			0
" in 2011 , @entity52 saw its @entity1 account compromised and used to send a fake message that president @entity55 had been assassinated			0
in february , @entity56 and @entity57 were similarly hacked			1
and earlier this year , @entity1 itself was hacked			0
user names and e-mail addresses for about 250,000 users were exposed			0
in many cases , account hacking happens when the target has an easy - to - guess password , accesses the account via public @entity67 , or forgets to log out after using an account on a publicly shared computer			0
accounts can obviously also be accessed when a user who has n't logged out loses his or her phone or has it stolen			0
but high - profile victims are often targeted by phishing , where hackers send deceptive e-mails that encourage victims to enter personal information			1
privacy advocates have long called on @entity1 to beef up its security			1
many security experts applauded the move thursday , at least partially			0
" right now @entity1 's @entity88 ( two - factor authentication ) is more likely to be welcomed by individuals who own personal accounts , and small companies with a @entity1 presence , than embraced by the high profile victims attacked by the ( hacker group ) @entity95 in the past , " @entity85 , of @entity86 , wrote on his blog			1
but he said it 's unlikely that many of the media outlets and other high - profile organizations that have been hardest hit will take advantage of the new tools			1
" sadly , i do n't think it 's going to help them at all , " he wrote			0
" media organizations who share breaking news via social media typically have many staff , around the globe , who share the same @entity1 accounts			2
@entity88 is n't going to help these companies , because they ca n't all access the same phone at the same time			0
" for those users , he recommends a system like @entity118 , on which multiple users can access the same account , to varying degrees of authority , with their own unique accounts and passwords			2
@entity1 's @entity18 noted that the security upgrade is n't a cure - all			1
" of course , even with this new security option turned on , it 's still important for you to use a strong password and follow the rest of our advice for keeping your account secure , " he wrote .			2

@entity1 has added a two - step login option to make users ' accounts more secure
the move comes after multiple high - profile hacks
the @entity36 , @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity46 are among recent hacking victims
security pro says many of those targeted wo n't use the new tool
