-- monday 's @entity2 ruling giving certain companies a right to raise religious objections to providing some types of birth control insurance to their employees leaves a number of important questions in its wake			1
and it 's unlikely any will be answered soon following the 5 - 4 decision that sparked enormous reaction and analysis around abortion , @entity17 , and the influence of religion in conducting business in a secular marketplace			1
here are five questions from the decision that was the most closely watched of this term			1
1 ) what does the decision mean for @entity17 ? @entity17 took a hit , but it remains intact			1
unlike the blockbuster decision two years ago when the @entity2 allowed the @entity17 to proceed , this case dealt only with one part of it			1
that is a regulation requiring private , for - profit companies -- often family - owned businesses -- to provide certain types of birth control coverage to their employees without a copay			1
looking ahead , the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law that was approved by @entity43 in 2010 without @entity45 support			1
is it the first chip in a long legal slugfest ? fights over @entity17 will no doubt continue on a range of issues , from other employer mandates to tax breaks for those in the state health benefit exchanges that offer the insurance plans to consumers			1
2 ) what is the impact of the ruling on workers ? the @entity62 says women employed by companies like the two firms at the center of the appeal -- arts - and - crafts retail giant @entity69 and the much smaller @entity70 -- have been hurt			1
and while the legal challenge was narrow , the potential impact is broader			1
the appeal applied to @entity75 contraception , which some have called the " morning after " pill , and intrauterine devices or @entity79 used by an estimated 2 million @entity81 women			0
in dissent , justice @entity82 called the decision " sweeping			2
" @entity85 , law professor at @entity86 , agreed			0
" people should not get lost in the reference to ' closely held corporations			0
' these types of businesses " are huge in this country and most of the businesses people relate with in their daily lives			0
" 3 ) what does it mean politically ? the decision no doubt will energize republicans on the campaign trail ahead of november midterm elections when control of the @entity103 is at stake			1
@entity45 have made @entity17 a giant campaign target , especially with the conservative base and we got a taste of the politics behind it all quickly after the justices weighed in			1
" today 's decision is a victory for religious freedom and another defeat for an administration that has repeatedly crossed constitutional lines in pursuit of " big government , said @entity62 speaker @entity112			2
" the president 's health care law remains an unworkable mess and a drag on our economy			0
" rep. @entity126 of @entity127 , who heads the @entity128 , framed the ruling as a campaign issue for the fall			0
" it is no surprise that @entity45 have sided against women on this issue as they have consistently opposed a woman 's right to make her own health care decisions , " she said , calling the ruling a " dangerous precedent			0
" but some @entity140 say there may be a silver lining : it could motivate younger women and unmarried women to show up at the polls			0
exit polls indicate that unmarried and younger women support @entity140 over @entity45 , but their numbers also traditionally drop from presidential elections to midterm contests			2
4 ) what 's a " religious " company ? liberals and conservatives on the @entity2 agreed on this much : the families that own @entity69 and @entity70 are undoubtedly religious			0
but does that make their companies religious ? that 's where the justices sharply disagreed			0
writing for the majority , @entity161 said the government has little problem acknowledging that non-profits , like churches and charities , can be religious -- and exempting them from the contraception mandate if they have moral objections			0
so why should companies be held to a different standard ? " any suggestion that for - profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law , " @entity161 writes			2
but there are big differences between charities and corporations , @entity82 argued in her dissent			0
religious organizations exist to further the interests of the faithful and usually employ workers or volunteers from their own community of believers			2
companies , on the other hand , exist to make money , @entity82 said , and by law are not allowed to discriminate in hiring based on religion			2
in fact , they often employ people of many faiths			0
so giving corporations religious rights opens a legal " minefield , " she argued			2
for instance , what 's to stop employers from objecting to blood transfusions , as @entity210 do ? or vaccinations , as some christian scientists do ? or benefits for same - sex couples , as many evangelicals and @entity216 do ? 5 ) so what 's next ? the @entity219 administration immediately said it would work with @entity43 to ensure female employees get reproductive health coverage provided in the @entity17			1
but congressional action is n't realistic , considering the sharply partisan politics involved in @entity17 , abortion rights , and interpretations of religious freedom			1
officials also hint that the president may use his executive authority to get around lawmakers in an election year			0
the practical result will likely be an administrative fix by the administration that subsidizes the contraceptives at issue , said @entity0 political analyst @entity237			0
so far , 9 million people have signed up for @entity17 health plans since last october			1
@entity0 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0

the decision leaves a number of questions in its wake
what is the impact on @entity17 , and for future legal challenges ?
what does it mean politically in a midterm year with control of the @entity103 at stake ?
and what now defines religion in business and what does it mean for workers ?
