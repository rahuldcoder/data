-- when life gives you @entity3 , make a " shamecast			1
" @entity5 is what i 'm calling tech journalist @entity9 's ingenious method of publicly shaming @entity3 for the way the cable company treated him on the phone			1
i hope it becomes a national trend			0
on tuesday morning , @entity9 posted an audio clip of his 18 - minute , nightmarish attempt to try to cancel service			2
instead of cooperating with @entity9 's simple request , which @entity3 is legally required to do , the customer service representative badgered him , threw up obstacles and generally exhibited sociopathic behavior			1
after the clip went viral , @entity9 received an official apology from the company , which said , in part : " the way in which our representative communicated with him is unacceptable and not consistent with how we train our customer service representatives			1
" nor is it consistent with the social norms of any society on @entity33			0
yet the clip went viral because of our cathartic solidarity with @entity9			2
we 've all been held hostage by big companies afraid of losing business			1
we 've all been told by anonymous customer service representatives that they " ca n't " help us			1
they " ca n't " discontinue service			2
they " ca n't " give us a confirmation number			0
in short , we 've all felt helpless			2
@entity3 's apology also cited its " embarrassment			1
" if embarrassment is the only language these companies speak , let 's give it to them			1
let 's shamecast companies who refuse to treat customers with respect			1
coincidentally , a few weeks before the @entity3 episode , i started recording my own phone calls with customer service representatives			1
my latest dispute had gone on for months , and i was still receiving bills for work that was never done ( and that had been officially canceled )			0
but things took a swift turn when i notified the representative that i was recording the conversation			2
soon after that call , i was contacted by the same person â € ” this time with an apologetic tone , assuring me the matter was resolved			1
most customer service representatives do not exhibit the sociopathic behavior of the @entity3 employee			1
most customer service reps are nice people who are just trying to do their job			1
furthermore , many of them have to suffer their own abuse from angry callers who feel trapped and mistreated by a company			0
most of the time it 's not the customer service rep 's fault			1
but we 've got to do something about the dysfunctional system of customer service			1
online review sites are helpful , but there 's a big difference between interpretation and reality			1
with a recorded conversation , you 've got proof			0
it 's the difference between " i 'm being mistreated by a company " and " i 'm being mistreated by a company â € ” listen to this audio clip of our interaction			0
" the next time you call a big company and get a difficult customer service representative , protect yourself			1
if you have an @entity112 , you do n't need anything else			0
there are several apps that can record calls for you			0
( for legal reasons , make sure you notify the representative that you 're recording the call			2
) if you do n't have a smartphone , no problem			0
as long as you put your call on speakerphone , there are several ways to record it			2
most laptops have built - in microphones , and you can simply record the conversation using @entity132 or another piece of recording software			0
or you can buy a cheap digital audio recording device that records in several modes , including			0
these files can be easily transferred to your laptop , and then , if necessary , to the @entity139			0
as you record your conversation , stay calm			0
if anybody is going to look like the bad guy , it 's not going to be you			0
hopefully , your call will go well , the company will cooperate with your request , and you can go about your day			0
but if not , you can upload your audio clip to @entity150 , like @entity9 did , and then broadcast it to the world through @entity152 , @entity153 , or your blog			0
imagine the relief you 'll experience the next time you interact with a telephone representative			2
when he or she tells you that your call may be recorded for " quality assurance purposes , " you will be able to respond with : " and just so you know , i 'm recording this call for consumer protection purposes			0
