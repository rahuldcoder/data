-- it was the annual gathering of the geeks in the city that never sleeps			0
after an attendance of 116,000 in 2012 , @entity5 tickets were sold out this year , as crowds lined up to attend panels , meet their favorite sci - fi / fantasy celebrities and comic book creators and show off their latest cosplay ( or costume play ) creations			1
despite a controversy on the first day of the convention on thursday -- in which the @entity5 tweeted on behalf of attendees on their own @entity20 accounts -- it appeared that the enthusiasm of fans did not let up with long lines over the rest of the weekend			1
the convention ceased that particular @entity20 practice on friday			0

" i just got out of a panel for @entity33 and @entity34 , and it was really easy to get into			0
with the others [ conventions ] , you ca n't get into those [ kind of panels ] without waiting for hours and hours			0
