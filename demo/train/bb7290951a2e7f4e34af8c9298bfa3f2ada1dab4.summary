-- it seems today that a new stage of life has opened up			2
sociologists call it " emergent adulthood , " @entity4 termed it " the @entity10 years , " and author @entity8 referred to it as " pre-adulthood			0
" people in this group are over 18 , but as they head toward 30 they still act and think like adolescents			0
they bounce from job to job and relationship to relationship , live with parents at home or in a house with five friends , watch @entity22 and play video games ( the boy - men ) and read " @entity33 " and ponder whether he 's just not into you ( the girl - women ) , while all of them sprinkle " like " and " ' n stuff " and " ya know " in their speech			1
@entity34 used to be a condition you escaped as soon as you could , but these 20 - somethings want to prolong it			1
we need to counteract them , to restore embarrassment to adolescent habits , and books are a key weapon			1
after all , books have the power to fortify attitudes			1
for instance , the " @entity52 " books , a wonderful phenomenon for tweens and early - teens , offered so compelling a world of heroic , beset youth and hostile adults that readers clung to @entity52 well past the proper age			1
in fact , quidditch matches have spread to more than 200 college campuses			0
" @entity33 " has had a similar impact , intensifying the ordinary shenanigans of teenagers to luridly high melodrama			0
why grow up when adolescence contains so much romance and suspense ? clinging to such young adult fantasies , pre-adults think that grownup content is a sensation , like " @entity74 , " a book so poorly written as to be beyond parody			1
only a 14 - year - old sensibility could read this passage when miss @entity79 first encounters @entity80 without laughing at the witlessness of the words			2
i open the door and stumble through , tripping over my own feet and falling headfirst into the office			0
double crap -- me and my two left feet ! i am on my hands and knees in the doorway to mr. @entity91 's office , and gentle hands are around me , helping me to stand			2
i am so embarrassed , damn my clumsiness			0
i have to steel myself to glance up			0
holy cow -- he 's so young			2
now , who trips over her own feet and falls headfirst to the floor ? and the callowness of " double crap " and " holy cow " could n't be more phony			0
young women loved it , though			0
and so did many older women , apparently			0
this is bad for our 20 - year - olds and bad for our culture			1
let us hope , then , that 2013 will unveil a new book about the young , but one that halts the creep of adolescence into adulthood			2
yes , there are several superb recent novels about teens and 20 - somethings by talented writers , like @entity120 ' " @entity119 " and @entity122 's " @entity121			1
" but they have too much sympathy for the emerging adult , too much understanding of young love and companionship , to do the work of correction			0
it will take an altogether different book to explode extended adolescence ; specifically , a frolicking comic novel that submits the interests and longings of pre-adults to whimsy , burlesque and farce			1
not gentle humor , but all - out comedy or satire that casts the whole experience and habitat of pre-adults as both ludicrous and avoidable			1
not trite pratfalls that , supposedly , make the characters lovable inept and self - involved , but outrageous ( and hilarious ) situations such as those in @entity152 ' " @entity151 " and @entity154 's " @entity153			1
" not sensitive and self - aware individuals coping with circumstances that afflict their whole age group , but memorable eccentrics like @entity165 from " @entity165 , " whose disdain for all things contemporary highlights the virtues and vices of modern life			2
this comic novel will amuse and sell well , for the better elements of our culture and our youth have grown impatient with the travails and aggrandizing of @entity173 books , movies , music and tv			1
it will serve a larger purpose , too , the same one that motivated satirists from @entity181 and @entity182 to @entity183 and @entity184 to @entity185 and the creators of " @entity187 " : to curb self - indulgence , deflate pretense , and expel stupidity			0
to take down a popular genre or a representative figure or a trendy pose , one good belly laugh works better than pages of strict criticism			0
@entity197 chided middle - @entity199 backwardness at length , but his best weapon was a one - word comic label : the " booboisie			1
" after @entity207 's nomination to the 2008 @entity209 ticket , intellectuals on the left attacked and on the right fretted , but the surest demolition came at the hands of @entity214 's impersonation			0
when the catastrophe movies of the 1970s became too theatrical and @entity215 , the film " airplane ! " appeared and one could no longer watch the genre with a straight face			0
let 's have a comic novel do the same for emergent adulthood			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

@entity226 : today 's 20 - somethings want to stretch out their adolescence
@entity226 : we need a comic novel that *exposes* the habits of " pre-adults " as ludicrous
he says books have the power to fortify attitudes
@entity226 : only all - out comedy or satire can show that pre-adults ' *behavior* is backward
