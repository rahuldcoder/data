-- great baseball players know every pitch is an opportunity			0
as with fastballs , international crises also present opportunities			0
and the current clash between @entity8 and @entity9 offers several potential game - changers			1
over the course of the past six days , @entity13 gunmen , along with other militant groups , have fired nearly 800 rockets at @entity8 cities and towns			1
the @entity8 air force , in response , has conducted some 1,200 sorties against @entity13 targets and -- despite warning civilians of impending attacks -- inflicted civilian casualties			1
now , the @entity8 army is poised to enter @entity9 and uproot @entity13 by force			1
destruction is expected to be at least as extensive as in the previous rounds of fighting between @entity13 and @entity8			1
thousands are liable to be displaced ; civilian casualties will mount			0
still , with nearly its entire population under rocket fire , @entity8 will have no choice but to invade			2
the obvious solution is a cease - fire similar to ones mediated by @entity38 in 2008 and 2012 and co-sponsored by the @entity39			2
such a cease - fire would end the shooting but would not hold for long			0
an unconditional cease - fire would enable @entity13 to rearm and reignite the conflict at a time of its choosing			0
@entity38 , moreover , is now focused on its domestic challenges and reluctant to become embroiled in regional conflicts			0
and @entity39 foreign policy has been weakened by its failure in the peace process and its resistance to intervening in the @entity54 and @entity55 civil wars			1
what 's the endgame ? worsening matters , the @entity38 government of gen. @entity59 has had a strained relationship with the @entity39 government that frowned on his undemocratic rise to power			2
in baseball terms , the crisis in @entity9 seems to be a fastball too blistering to hit			2
yet , the very threat of full - scale fighting can serve to motivate the combatants to seek a way out			0
promised a new beginning in their relations with @entity73 , the @entity38 can be induced to once again mediate between @entity13 and @entity8			1
and @entity39 can reclaim its traditional leadership			0
a simultaneous cease - fire can be achieved , but that would only be the first in a multistaged diplomatic process			0
the next stage would apply the formula with which the @entity39 and @entity81 successfully removed chemical weapons from @entity54			1
@entity39 inspectors can locate @entity13 ' rocket stockpiles and ship them abroad for destruction			1
at the same time , the people of @entity9 would receive the international aid needed to repair the war damage and energize their economy , which has been failing for years			1
finally , once the rockets are eliminated , @entity8 can ease the maritime blockade of @entity9			1
the @entity92 will be spared further hardship and @entity13 deprived of one of its chief pretexts for attacking @entity8			1
the crisis also presents an opportunity to strengthen @entity92 moderates			2
@entity39 and @entity101 - trained police officers loyal to the @entity102 can be stationed at the border crossings from @entity8 into @entity9			1
similarly , these security personnel can be deployed at the @entity9 border crossings that @entity38 formerly closed but would now reopen			0
opinion : how @entity108 missile defense buys time for @entity8 ideally , the @entity102 would replace @entity13 rule over @entity9			1
it is doubtful whether that goal could be achieved swiftly and without prolonged violence			0
yet a new status quo can be created that is more stable and less prone to breakdown			0
effectively demilitarized , with a stimulated economy and an expanded role for @entity92 committed to the peace process , @entity9 can cease being the cause of repeated conflict			2
the @entity122 administration could point to a significant diplomatic victory , @entity38 could reassert its regional leadership and @entity8 and the @entity102 could create a context for restarting the peace process			0
israelis and @entity92 are indeed confronting a complex and dangerous situation			0
but as every slugger knows , the faster the pitch , the further the ball will fly off the bat			0
for all of the pain and trauma it has caused so far , the crisis in @entity9 offers all the parties a chance to hit deep , perhaps even a diplomatic home run			2
fearing daughter 's border wedding the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			2

@entity144 : @entity147 crisis presents opportunity for creative diplomacy
he says model for a solution should be the removal of chemical weapons from @entity54
@entity144 : @entity39 inspectors could oversee removal of @entity13 rocket stockpiles
he says international aid could repair @entity9 's economy , and @entity8 could ease blockade
