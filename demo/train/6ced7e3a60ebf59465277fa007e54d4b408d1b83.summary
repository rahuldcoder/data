-- it 's a crisp november morning and @entity2 is paddling his way down an idyllic river -- in a floating bed			1
the 63 - year - old @entity6 is n't escaping some sort of natural disaster			1
instead , the white - haired man with bulging red nose and yellow raincoat is doing what clowns do best -- making us laugh			2
" the art of clowning is filled with fantasy and absurdity -- a collision of the incompatible , " he says , speaking from his surreal fairytale home outside of @entity16			1
" it 's a way to create a new world , rather than repeat the existing one			1
for example , rather than making your way out through the door , you would make your way out through the window , as it 's closer to the tram stop			2
" @entity2 is one of the most famous clowns working in the world today , winning an @entity35 for his ethereal @entity36 , and performing in 50 countries across the globe in a remarkable career that began in @entity40 four decades ago			1
fantasy land stepping inside @entity2 's rambling home is like walking into a dream -- staircases melt into the walls , a psychedelic caravan parked out front beckons the visitor inside , and childlike murals swirl on every surface			1
indeed , there 's barely a right angle in sight in the dizzying house of rainbow , folk - inspired knick - knacks			1
windows of every shape and size give a glimpse to the lush gardens outside -- not to mention the emerald river with an iron bed boat moored to its banks			2
it 's a place to feed @entity2 's imagination , which in recent years has helped revolutionize the world of clowning -- transporting it from the big top to the theater stage			1
rather than the buffoonery of the circus , @entity2 's clown is a more thoughtful , poetic character , with a minimalist style			1
" at the beginning of my career , my clowning was filled with movement , like a child , when you are filled with so much energy that you think you could jump to the sky , " he said			2
" today my perception of clowning is that you should be able to move just one centimeter and get a reaction from the audience as if you moved an entire mountain			2
" @entity89 it was watching @entity92 film " @entity93 " on tv as a seven - year - old growing up in @entity40 , that @entity2 first decided to make a career out of clowning			1
" my mom turned the tv off because it was time for me to go to bed , and i cried all night as i wanted to know what would happen next in the movie , " he said			2
" the next day , when i was about to leave for school , i thought : ' i have to wear something similar to @entity92			0
' so i took my father 's boots , hat and a cane and went to school			2
i made my friends laugh for the entire evening			0
" read this : ' @entity110 ' @entity92 demanded 342 takes for one movie scene @entity2 was fascinated by the way movement could convey emotion , and studied dances from across the world -- everything from @entity120 's surreal @entity119 performances , to rock ' n roll , and tango			1
he even analyzed the way @entity125 cartoon characters held certain poses			0
" in order to learn how to move as a clown , i imitate the way kids , insane people , drunkards and animals move , " he said			0
" these movements are not limited by intellect			0
" the perfect example is to see a child playing on a playground , or running around a forest -- this is how humankind used to be originally -- genuine and excited			0
these movements evoke a desire to follow			0
" provocative performer @entity2 performed on state television throughout the 1970s and 1980s , using his wordless routines to mock the authorities without falling foul of draconian censorship			1
" during @entity40 times , when @entity147 was still in power and there was no freedom of speech and expression , i came up with idea of movements without any words to express your personality , " he said			0
" this idea became massively popular , because i was saying important things without actually saying them			0
" @entity2 became one of the country 's best known clowns , later creating the " @entity164 , " an international organization uniting clowns , and the " @entity167 , " a traveling theater that meandered from @entity169 in @entity170 to @entity16 's @entity171			1
universal language of course , not every country has the same sense of humor , and @entity2 must alter his shows depending on where in the world he 's performing			1
@entity179 prefer a faster pace			0
and the @entity185 seem quite happy for him to stand still for 10 seconds or more			0
" i feel very happy when i discover something new on stage , " said @entity2			1
" for example , you perform in @entity191 and realize that everything you have done in @entity193 does not work with a @entity191 audience			0
" so you start searching , improvising and suddenly you hear a laughter			0
you wonder why this laughter happened , so you start to dig into those movements			0
every culture has its own aspects of movement			0
" @entity2 seems determined to explore them all			2
