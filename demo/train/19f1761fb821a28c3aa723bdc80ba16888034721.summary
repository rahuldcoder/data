-- perhaps the greatest enemy of @entity3 's poorly received last album was time			1
released in december 2009 , just six months after the multiplatinum crooner pleaded guilty to assaulting @entity5 , " graffiti " -- frankly , not a bad collection at all -- was widely panned			2
everything from the title of his new disc , " @entity14 " ( an acronym for the off - putting title '' forgiving all @entity17 '' ) , to his recent nude photos and ill - advised tweets suggests that @entity3 has not yet mastered the art of image rehabilitation			1
musically , though , he 's in top form			2
" @entity14 " ( out march 22 ) shines brighter than anything he produced before that now - infamous incident			1
melodic raps on tracks like '' @entity24 '' and '' @entity28 '' lead to intoxicating hooks , as do bedroom knockers '' @entity31 '' and '' no bs , '' which for better ( or worse ) rival the bump - ' n ' - grind heights of ' 90s @entity37 crew @entity35			2
the uncertainty of love is a recurring theme on the album : on the thumping midtempo cut '' @entity43 to you , '' @entity3 and guest @entity46 trade verses assuring their ladies of their dedication			1
the more relevant question is whether @entity3 can count on his old fans to be just as devoted			0
the fact that several singles have already crept into @entity54 's top 20 is a good indication that he 's winning them back			0
" graffiti " clearly came too soon			0
and some still think @entity3 should go -- and stay -- away			0
but on its own merits , " @entity14 " deserves to be heard			1
