@entity0 can not be sure whether chronic traumatic encephalopathy is clawing through his brain tissue right now , but he suspects that it is			0
after all , he fits an emerging portrait of people diagnosed with the disease : a former professional football player who took lots of hits to the head -- a couple knocked him out -- and a life off the field that has begun to unravel			1
" my mood has changed , " said @entity0 , 36 , a soft - spoken former running back who played for several teams , including the @entity15			2
" sometimes i think i 'm going crazy			0
" @entity0 began to suspect @entity17 several years ago when an uncharacteristic dark mood and , occasionally , deep anger began to bubble up at unexpected times			1
" i 'd be talking to a cousin of mine , disagree with him , and i 'd just want to do something to him , " @entity0 said			0
" i do n't know why i had those thoughts , but i wanted to hurt him			0
" jenkins can not shake the feeling that these and other symptoms he has add up to @entity17 , but he will never be sure			1
the only way to diagnose @entity17 is after death -- by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau			1
" the problem is , people are diagnosing @entity17 clinically all over the place , " said @entity36 , professor of neurology and neurosurgery at @entity39			1
" there is no framework to make that diagnosis while someone is alive			0
" @entity36 and his colleagues want to change that			0
he is co-author of a new study that is beginning to describe what the disease looks like during life			1
the study , published wednesday in the journal @entity55 , suggests that when @entity17 symptoms emerge at a young age , players more often exhibit behavioral and mood problems , whereas symptoms that begin later in life tend to show up as memory and thinking problems			1
family members and loved ones of 36 athletes -- 29 football players , three professional hockey players , one professional wrestler and three boxers diagnosed with @entity17 after they died -- were quizzed about , among other things , the nature of the players ' cte symptoms and when they appeared			1
a tale of two former @entity77 players -- and their brains according to those family reports , 11 players in the group first struggled with memory and decision - making , at an average age of 69			1
twenty - two players first exhibited mood and behavior problems like depression and hopelessness or violent , explosive behavior			2
those players tended to be younger when they died , an average age of 51			0
three players did not display any symptoms before being diagnosed with @entity17			1
it is too early in the research to know why some symptoms crop up early and others later -- and why the symptoms seem to diverge , or not show up at all , depending on the player			2
one theory among scientists is that where and how the damage manifests in the brain matters			0
for example , tau , which tends to be peppered in particular areas of the brains of people diagnosed with @entity17 , could damage brain tissue at different stages of the disease , depending on the person			1
" there is no specific order of changes in @entity17 ; it 's on a case - by - case basis , " said @entity36 , who is also the co-founder of the @entity115			2
" it could be that some people have more initial changes to ( brain ) areas that are more responsible for mood and aggression and impulse control			2
" symptoms could also be explained by other changes in the brain , associated with repetitive brain trauma , that have nothing to do with tau or @entity17			1
@entity133 had brain disease that comes from hits to head " this disease remains somewhat mysterious in terms of exactly what its causes are and how it 's expressed , " said dr. @entity137 , co-director of the @entity138 and a @entity17 researcher , who was not involved in the current study			1
but @entity137 says this study , though small and not generalizable for all cases of @entity17 , adds to current knowledge about the disease			1
for example , the data did reveal other interesting patterns , particularly related to genetics			0
the study participants with @entity17 were more likely than people without the disease to express the @entity158 gene , which is associated with slower recovery and worse cognition after traumatic brain injury ; it 's also associated with later development of alzheimer 's disease			1
@entity36 and his colleagues know that their study sample is skewed : people who tend to donate a loved one 's brain to be studied for @entity17 also tend to suspect a problem			1
and there is no formula for how many hits ( or what type of hits ) tip the balance toward symptomatic disease			2
there has also been no examination of what role things like steroids or body weight may play			0
even with those caveats , @entity36 is confident that " eventually , clinicians will have the ability to diagnose the disease during life			2
" in the meantime , former players like @entity0 are left in a fight against time and the progression of whatever brain disease their concussions may have wrought			0
" i 'm paying attention to things more , " he said , " and i 'm more worried about my health			0
" in the meantime , researchers of many disciplines are scrambling to define a disease that 's definition is elusive at best			0
" for perspective , alzheimer 's disease was first described in the first decades of the 1900s , and we still do n't have the ability to diagnose it definitively during life , " @entity36 said			0
" it still ca n't be cured , prevented or even slowed down			0
" both @entity0 and @entity36 hope that for @entity17 , it will not be that long			2
@entity211 , @entity212 planning $ 100 million study			0

@entity17 has been seen in brains of athletes who have taken a lot of hits to the head
@entity17 can be diagnosed only after death , but a new study begins to describe symptoms
athletes with the disease exhibit behavioral and mood problems , as well as memory issues
