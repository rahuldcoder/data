-- @entity2 fashion designers do n't hold a monopoly on haute			0
every april the country 's top pâtissiers and chocolatiers prove they can be just as outlandish as they unveil their annual collection of chocolate easter eggs			1
these edible delights take countless forms			0
master pâtissier @entity12 looked @entity13 when creating " @entity14 , " a sushi plate made entirely of chocolate , chocolate paste , marzipan and nougat			2
chop sticks allow choc - o - holics to dip their sugary maki and sushi in salted butter caramel			0
@entity26 and his army of pastry chefs at @entity25 dreamed up a blue - and - white chocolate egg that resembles traditional @entity31 porcelain			1
at @entity33 , head pastry chef @entity32 has sculpted an open - work chocolate egg that is inspired by the @entity36 jewelry collection			1
children staying at the hotel can participate in the @entity40 's annual @entity39 in its @entity2 garden			1
the child who finds a pink egg will win the sculptured chocolate — and an 18 - carat pink gold @entity36 diamond ring that is hidden inside			2
@entity47 , the head pastry chef at the @entity48 , says that @entity50 's obsession with the high - end egg stems from the country 's history of gastronomy and @entity55			1
apparently a gorgeous egg honors both			0
for his part , @entity47 and his team have crafted 50 limited edition eggs , each of which weighs 450g ( the same as a 12 ounce can of soda ) , and costs 68 € ( $ 95 )			2
inspired by the @entity31 tangram puzzle , the egg has seven removable pieces that together form a shape at the egg 's base			2
" i thought i could work on the idea of a chocolate egg that could be as delicious as it is playful , with an ' @entity73 ' story and origin , " @entity47 says			2
" this was a good way to combine the @entity2 knowledge we use to make chocolate with the @entity73 heritage			1
" but this is no game			0
" the most difficult part of the process is to fix the whole egg with the most accuracy and neatness as possible , " he says			2
" i want the egg to look like a jewel , or a collectible			0
" international appeal @entity2 chefs are bringing their magic to the @entity93 , and helping to elevate @entity39 eggs beyond the cream - filled , grocery store variety			1
at the @entity98 at @entity99 , @entity2 pastry chef @entity97 spent 25 days making 50 @entity39 eggs , which are actually three eggs in one			1
a nine - inch egg , made from the finest @entity103 chocolate , houses a five - inch egg , made with the brand 's @entity102 , which in turn contains a three - inch egg made from @entity109 dark chocolate			1
the $ 125 price tag reflects the labor involved in this most delicate process : @entity97 and his team spent seven hours crafting the first egg			0
they had to watch the temperature throughout			1
to temper the chocolate @entity97 first had heat it to around 50 or 55 degrees @entity120 ( 122 to 131 degrees @entity121 ) , then cool it to around 28 degrees c ( 82 degrees f ) , and then mold and shape it at no more than 32 degrees c ( 90 degrees f )			2
" it 's a long process because you have to temper the chocolate , then mold it , then create the right thickness , " @entity97 says			1
" if it 's too thick guests can not break it			2
if it 's too thin it will be too fragile to travel			2
" four millimeters is a safe thickness			0
@entity97 points out two other perils of his work			0
if water finds its way into the chocolate bowl , the chocolate will never harden and it will be impossible to use during molding			1
the other issue is timing			0
a chef who leaves his chocolate on the stove for 15 minutes is signing his own pink slip			2
" the chocolate dictates your work and when it 's ready , " he says			1
" it 's like cooking a piece of meat for a guest who wants it medium rare			0
if you wait and let the meat rest for too long it will be overcooked			0
it 's the same with chocolate			1
you can not have a second chance			0
" all dressed up for luxury hotels , @entity39 eggs are more than just sweet treats for guests			1
they are also an opportunity to help connect their brand with the joys of @entity39			1
at @entity171 's , @entity98 's iconic @entity173 hotel , limited edition @entity39 eggs have become one of the hotel 's most anticipated traditions			1
pastry chef @entity177 now has the process down pat. " we use two molds which we then assemble to make one hollow egg , " he says			1
" once they are gently warmed , we melt and temper the chocolate by flooding , pouring , lining each egg shell 3 times with thin layers of chocolate			0
these shells are left to crystallize properly in their molds overnight			0
" they then de-mould the eggs , assemble the two halves , fill them with miniature chocolate eggs , and , to avoid a heavy and unsightly seam , use a warm metal tray " to melt the seam edge of the eggs which are then carefully joined together and left to set			1
" but perhaps the most crucial step — and the one responsible for the first impression — is the packaging			0
his team use special black - and - white foil meant to invoke the hotel 's lobby			0
" we hope and hear that people love our @entity209 , " he says			0
" it 's a little bit of magic of @entity171 's that people can take away with them "			0
