-- as our nation salutes the men and women who risked their lives for our country , @entity1 share the innovative ways they made a positive impact on veterans ' lives			1
ireporter @entity12 decided to give back to the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , that he credits with saving his life from post-traumatic stress disorder and diabetes			1
this @entity20 vet got his hands dirty in the grounds surrounding the new @entity24 building , planting $ 500 worth of flowers to bring some color and fragrance to his brothers in arms			0
this small change made a major transformation in not only the austere building , but also stavitz himself			2
" the trip is 90 miles , round trip , but it is worth it for my own therapy , " @entity12 said			1
" it pleased the veterans , it pleased the staff , and veterans would stop to talk to me about what i was doing			2
" those chats about shared experiences became an important part of their healing process			0
@entity12 recently visited his flowers , marveling that they were still alive at this time of year in @entity15			1
" they looked like old friends , " @entity12 said , " the gift that keeps on giving			1
" he admits his gift may be small , but believes it is not insignificant			0
he hopes that people find one thing that makes them smile , like planting flowers does for him , and think about how that small act can help themselves as well as those who have given so much to our country			0
watch @entity12 's beautifying efforts , on @entity63			1
for @entity65 , it all started because of @entity66 , her late husband 's horse			1
" he needed a job ! " laughs @entity65 , who founded the @entity68 in @entity69			1
the program , near the @entity72 , is the @entity74 's first branch of the @entity76 program			2
in this program , healing occurs on horseback			0
the horses ' mission is to help injured soldiers overcome the difficulties of returning home after battle , especially physical and mental disabilities			0
each soldier is paired with a horse and a lead volunteer for an eight - week program , completely free of charge			0
" we teach them to understand how the horse thinks , " @entity65 said , " to use the thinking side of the brain instead of the reactive one			1
and all of a sudden a light bulb goes off , and the soldiers think , ' i can apply this , too			0
' " by developing a close relationship with their horse during their time at @entity103 , soldiers learn to trust again in a way that is difficult for them to do with people			0
" i ca n't say enough good things about the program , " @entity65 said			2
" my heart has always been there , and they have done so much for our country ... this really helps them get back to society			0
" for @entity65 , who has a son in @entity118 and a daughter in the @entity120 , it is a personal joy for her to make this difference			1
see work being done at the @entity68 , on @entity63			0
dentist @entity123 was looking for a way to help his young patients avoid cavities , when he came up with a campaign that would also benefit our soldiers ' sweet tooth			1
after every @entity132 he offers a candy buyback , where candy - sharing children receive a dollar coin for every pound of candy they bring in for overseas troops			2
this november , he has already received about 200 pounds of candy			0
in eight years of @entity123 's candy buyback program , he has collected over 2,000 pounds			1
@entity123 chuckled when considering the children 's surprising generosity			1
" the kids that are quick to give up their candy have the @entity132 bags that have been clearly picked clean of their favorite treats , " @entity123 said			2
he helps those children struggling to give up their @entity132 haul with a certificate of patriotism , a picture , and of course , the dollar coins			0
the soldiers , @entity123 said , give away much of the candy to the children in @entity157 and @entity118 , who have never tasted @entity159 sweets			2
but he has also received letters that the troops devour a lot of it themselves , and want more			0
" over there they really do n't get to celebrate @entity132 or other holidays , " @entity123 said , " so it gives them a little taste of home			2
" see the candy donations pile up , on @entity63			0
