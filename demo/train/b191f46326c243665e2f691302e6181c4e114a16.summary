@entity1 a team of senior - level @entity5 agents with decades of experience in long - term criminal and public corruption cases are handling the federal civil rights investigation into the controversial chokehold death of an unarmed black man by a white police officer , two law enforcement sources said tuesday			1
the @entity1 - based agents have come together in recent weeks following a december grand jury decision to not indict the police officer , the sources told @entity2			2
the goal is a " fresh look " into the july death of @entity22 at the hands of police officer @entity24 , in a case that led to anti-police demonstrations throughout the nation , a senior law enforcement official said			1
the veteran investigators include an agent from the white - collar crime division who specializes in long - term criminal investigations , a supervisor in the public corruption unit and an agent who investigated the infamous 1997 police torture case involving @entity34 immigrant @entity33 , the source said the investigation , which began in earnest after a grand jury declined to indict the officer , will look at everything from the actions of the responding officers and paramedics on the @entity49 street where @entity22 died to the role @entity51 training may have played in the death , according to the source			1
" we want ... to take a fresh look , " the senior official said			0
@entity24 's attorney , @entity59 , said the agents will find " there was no willful conduct with the specific intent to violate a federally protected right			0
" " this was a simple street encounter and race was n't an issue , " he said			0
during @entity22 's fatal police encounter on july 17 , he raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him			1
seconds later , a video shows an officer behind @entity22 grab him in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk , rolling him onto his stomach			1
" i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe ! " @entity22 said repeatedly , his cries muffled into the pavement			2
@entity22 , 43 , was pronounced dead that day			2
police had suspected @entity22 of selling cigarettes illegally			1
@entity22 : the haunting last words of a dying man as part of the federal investigation , @entity5 agents have visited the scene of @entity22 's death			1
they 're also interviewing witnesses as well as reviewing witness testimony , the senior official said			0
the investigation is overseen by the federal prosecutor 's office in @entity95			0
the agents will also look over evidence from the @entity51 's internal affairs investigation and may ask to interview officers and emergency medical technicians who responded , the official said			2
another aspect of the probe will be whether a chokehold was in fact used in restraining @entity22 , the senior official said			1
the cause of @entity22 's death was " compression of neck ( chokehold ) , compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police , " the medical examiner 's office has said			1
the death was ruled a homicide			0
the medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma , obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in @entity22 's death			2
the grand jury was made up of 14 white and nine nonwhite members , according to law enforcement sources			0
a total of 12 jurors who heard all the evidence must be in agreement for a decision			0
videos document @entity22 's last moments the case became emblematic of longstanding tensions between police and minority communities , especially given that the majority of people stopped under the @entity51 's former " stop - and - frisk " police policy were @entity144 or @entity145			2
a federal court ruled that stop - and - frisk was unconstitutional and tantamount to racial profiling			0
@entity22 's death led to demonstrations around the city and came weeks before the racially charged police shooting of unarmed teen @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154			1
separate grand jury decisions declining to prosecute police officers in connection with both deaths sparked national protests that sometimes involved clashes with police			1
after the death , @entity161 was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation , and the @entity51 commissioner ordered an extensive review of training procedures			0
two lawsuits have previously been filed against @entity161			0
the plaintiffs in both suits allege false arrest , unlawful imprisonment , civil rights violations and other charges			1
one suit from 2013 was dismissed in january 2014 , while the second , from february 2014 , remains open .			0
