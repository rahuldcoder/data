-- it did n't seem like @entity2 could get any bigger			1
she 's got massive success in the music industry , millions of devoted fans and a permanent place in pop culture history , the latter thanks to an incident that the world will never , ever allow @entity11 to forget			1
but clearly , that was n't enough for the ( literally ) towering singer			2
in one week , she became the second - biggest selling act of 2014 and the only solo platinum - selling artist of the year -- all with the debut of her new album , " 1989			2
" she pulled her music off @entity21 , the most popular streaming site in the world , and managed to get pulled into a political controversy thanks to a remark during the @entity26 race in @entity27			2

it 's the next step in the evolution of the singer who launched her career in country music at the age of 16			1
now 24 , she has weathered critics who have kept a tally of some of her alleged celebrity sins : her music was n't country enough , her wide - eyed " gosh , i really won " awards acceptance speeches were n't genuine , and her relationships were mostly fodder for publicity and potential song material			2
@entity2 's ' 1989 ' has biggest sales week since 2002 so what does @entity2 do ? she releases her first fully pop album , designates " @entity73 " -- an ode to her haters -- as the first single and declares herself happily single			1

" she was plugged in			0
she was there every day , " he said of his tour mate			0
" she was the captain of the ship			0
" protected by ' @entity109 ' @entity2 gets that if this were high school , she would be the annoying straight - a student who is gorgeous , is friends with the other cool kids ( @entity2 is bffs with the likes of actress @entity115 and singer @entity116 ) , volunteers after school and dates the cutest boys			1
but she 's running for homecoming queen and is courting your vote -- hard			2
not that she does n't already have plenty of admirers			0
her fans , known as " @entity109 , " are equal parts adoring and protective of her			2
come for @entity2 on @entity127 , and you are sure to encounter her army			1
they are paying her back in part for being one of the most accessible music artists in the business			2

before the world ever heard a note from " 1989 , " @entity2 handpicked fans who had really , really wanted to meet her and invited them to her homes around the world for a listening party			1

5 reasons you love @entity2 ... even if you do n't want to @entity2 told @entity161 that not only did they honor her request , but her fans stood guard when the album was leaked online two days before its october 27 release date			1
" anytime they 'd see an illegal post of it , they 'd comment , ' why are you doing this ? why do n't you respect the value of art ? ' " @entity2 said			1
" ' do n't do this			0
we do n't believe in this			0
' and it was wild seeing that happen			0
" she needs that support in face of @entity83 disliking the fact that she 's been named @entity187			2
the choice of the @entity189 , @entity190 , native to represent @entity83 has been less than popular , despite her move to @entity192 and her new single " @entity193			0
" " i 'm incensed ! it 's insulting , " @entity194 frontman and @entity195 , @entity83 , native @entity196 told the @entity197			2

@entity213 , the state 's retiring @entity214 senator , entangled @entity2 in a bit of political negativity when he invoked her name while discussing @entity220 @entity219 , who was vying for his seat			1
" well , i ( got to ) thinking about that			0
i do n't care if she 's as good looking as @entity2 or as nice as mr. @entity224 , but if she votes like @entity225 , she 's wrong for the state of @entity27 , " @entity213 said			1

@entity2 has also ended up as part of the debate about @entity233 music streaming			1
on november 3 , she pulled her catalog from @entity21 , leaving its 40 million users bereft of her five albums			0
@entity21 quickly courted her return with a playlist filled with songs like " @entity2 " by @entity240 and " @entity241 " by @entity242			1
" we hope she 'll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone , " @entity21 said in a statement			2
" we believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want			1
" @entity2 told @entity250 that the decision was her own			1
" i can say is that music is changing so quickly , and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly , that everything new , like @entity21 , all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment , " she said			1
" and i 'm not wiling to contribute my life 's work to an experiment that i do n't feel fairly compensates the writers , producers , artists and creators of this music			1
