-- superman is looking better than ever			2
in august , a pristine copy of @entity4 no. 1 , containing the origin story of the @entity6 , sold for more than $ 3.2 million on @entity7			1
but even if you do n't have that kind of dough , you can see what the historic issue -- rated 9 out of 10 by @entity12 , an independent grading authority -- looks like thanks to a scan the company posted on its website			1
" i think the first impression in my mind is just like it came off the newsstand , " said @entity19 , a 15 - year veteran of @entity12 , who did the final grading of the comic book for the company			2
" it was absolutely fresh and amazing			2
" though @entity4 no. 1 is best known for the @entity29 and @entity30 story that created @entity1 , the issue -- which has been rarely reprinted in full -- has several other tales inside			1
there 's " @entity35 , " foe of crooked cattlemen ; " @entity36 : @entity37 , " " champion of law and order " ; and " @entity41 , five star reporter , " who uncovers corruption with the help of photographer pal @entity46			2
and that 's not all ! according to an ad on the inside front cover , you could win a dollar ( that 's in 1938 bucks , incidentally ) for hand - coloring the title page of " @entity35 " with your very own crayons			0
however , for those of you who actually own a copy of @entity4 no. 1 , this is not encouraged			1
the scan has been available since talk of the auction began in july			0
but even after the actual , physical comic book was purchased by @entity67 / @entity66 on august 24 , it 's stayed up			1
@entity19 says @entity12 has no plans to take it down			0
it 's certainly boosted site traffic : in the three months since the scan was posted , sessions are up more than 50 % from the previous three - month period			0
users are up 166 %			0
the scan has received more than 52,000 page views , @entity12 reports			0
@entity75 , an auctioneer specializing in comics with @entity78 in @entity79 , says that posting a full scan of a classic comic is " unusual , " but he believes it 's beneficial to everybody -- including @entity84 , which owns the rights to @entity1			1
( @entity84 is a unit of @entity87 , as is @entity0			0
) " the scans were done as a historical item , rather than something that would be published , and the book has been reprinted a number of times anyway , " he said			0
" it 's all good publicity			0
" the process of scanning wo n't do any damage to the value of the comic book , he adds			1
a lot of the classic books of the ' 30s and ' 40s that have been reprinted in book editions are scanned from originals themselves			0
also , having online copies available does n't affect their collectability			1
" most collectors today are not like they were in the 1970s and ' 80s , when they were buying comics because they liked to read them , " he said			2
" comics like this are sold as an investment more than anything else			0
the historical value of the book is still intact , and that 's what people are actually buying when they buy a rare comic			0
" the legacy of @entity1 these days , of course , quite a bit is online			1
both @entity127 and @entity84 , the two major superhero purveyors , have parts of their websites devoted to accessing titles online , both free and for a fee			2
a number of sites specialize in posting comics old and new			0
nevertheless , when it comes to historical work , @entity1 -- who will return to the movies next year with @entity84 stablemate @entity140 -- still reigns supreme			1
and though the $ 3.2 million for the @entity142 no. 1 is the most anyone 's paid for a comic book , @entity75 believes there 's a another copy out there somewhere , hidden carefully in somebody 's collection			1
" one of these days it 'll turn up , and it will blow the rest of them out of the water , " he said and then added words that even @entity1 would appreciate : " the sky 's the limit			1

the pristine $ 3.2 million @entity4 issue is available online
the issue featured the @entity1 origin story
online *appearance* wo n't hurt ; collectors keep physical copies safe
