@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few reflections from survivors of the massacre at an @entity0 , @entity1 , theater from @entity2 interviews : ' that 's when i felt a big ole bang in my leg ' @entity12 , 18 , said she is " not a huge @entity14 fan , really , " but decided to go to the movie after she and her friend @entity16 stopped at a hotel in @entity0 en route from @entity19 to their homes in @entity22 , @entity23			1
when the gunfire broke out , @entity12 told @entity2 affiliate @entity25 from her bed in @entity27 , she thought it was special effects in the movie			1
but she soon realized what was going on			2
" that 's when i grabbed @entity16 and we ducked under our seats			2
" crouched behind her seat , she prayed			2
" lord , just protect us , keep us safe , " she recalled thinking			2
" that 's when i felt a big ole bang in my leg			1
" once the shooting stopped , @entity12 tried to run from the theater , but did n't get far			1
" of course , i fell because my knee is all gone , " she said about the bullet wound that shattered her knee			2
" i tried to run and just stumbled and fell			2
" by now , @entity12 and her friend had separated in the panic , and another movie patron risked his life by helping her scramble to the exit , where she and @entity16 reunited , she said			1
" @entity16 laid me on the concrete , " and a police officer and a member of the @entity54 soon approached			2
the officer carried her to a patrol car and the member of the @entity54 wrapped her leg , which had been losing blood quickly			0
despite the chaos , @entity12 said she felt calm			1
" i was overwhelmed with the sense of security and peace -- that it was going to be ok , " she said			1
having already undergone three surgeries on her leg , @entity12 said she expected to be transferred thursday to a hospital closer to her home			1
' a silver lining to a very dark cloud ' @entity69 was born tuesday morning to @entity70 and @entity71			0
they had gone to the movie as a treat before the expected delivery this week of their child			0
the gunfire did not strike @entity70 , but @entity71 was shot in the face			0
he lost his right eye , suffered brain damage and is in critical condition			0
his brother said @entity71 seems to understand what happened , but it was unclear whether he knew he has a baby boy			0
" he 's making small improvements , baby steps every day , " said @entity87 about his eldest brother			0
when the baby was taken into @entity71 's hospital room , " he moved his hand towards the baby , trying to feel his son , trying to touch him			0
" @entity71 's heart rate and blood pressure rose , @entity87 said			0
@entity71 had been doing standup comedy routines in @entity99 and was working full time at @entity100 , but he had no health insurance , his brother said			0
@entity87 said becoming an uncle was bittersweet for him			0
" we were all looking forward to this , " he said			0
" it 's a silver lining to a very dark cloud , but we all know @entity71 , we know he 's a fighter , we know he 's not going to stay out of that child 's life for any length of time if he can avoid it			1
" @entity113 visits victims , families honor lost loved ones ' there were kids , mothers and fathers ' @entity120 survived the bloodbath in @entity0 , and his friends hail him as a hero for shielding them with his body			1
@entity120 was shot in the left calf and right arm in the process			1
" of course i 'm glad it 's over with , and i 'm glad i 'm alive and i get to see my kids , " @entity120 , whose sons are 7 and 9 , said as his voice cracked with emotion			1
" but i also think about , you know , the other people that were n't as lucky as i was			0
there were kids , mothers and fathers that were there , and they 're dead			0
" @entity120 said he wants to go back into the screening room where the killings took place , " look down at that same seat and say ' i beat you			1
you did not take this life			1
' " tales of heroism abound from tragedy ' you do n't want to leave knowing that you said something ' @entity154 says he 's not sure how he survived the killings			2
he and a friend both escaped unhurt , and he said he has " a blank feeling inside " when he looks back at the building			2
remembering the victims but the experience left him sounding somewhat philosophical			0
" certain circumstances can happen at any time , " he said			0
" try to make the most of what you can with your family , your friends , colleagues , people that you probably had bad past relationships with			0
because you do n't want to leave knowing that you said something , or did n't say enough			0
" ' who expects to be shot in a movie theater ? ' @entity175 was also wounded in the early friday massacre			1
her friend and co-worker , @entity179 , was shot in the head , and @entity175 found out saturday morning that he did n't survive			1
" he was the whole reason we all went , " @entity175 said from her hospital bed			1
brain condition may have helped saved shooting victim @entity175 served in the @entity186 until four years ago , and her service included a stint in the @entity190 capital @entity191			1
but at home , in a moviehouse , " nobody was prepared " for the violence that was unleashed , she said			1
" if you 're going over to a war zone , you know there 's the potential that you 're going to be shot at			0
potential that mortars are going to come over the wall			0
potential that somebody is going to throw a grenade at you			0
where if you 're sitting in a movie theater trying to watch a movie with your friends , who expects to be shot in a movie theater ? none of us did			2
