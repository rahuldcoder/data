@entity0 -- as @entity3 leaves the @entity4 for its five - week august recess , freshman rep. @entity2 is headed home a little frustrated			1
" the biggest problem for me is we 're voting on extremes			1
you do n't see compromise bills , " he said thursday evening on the east steps of the @entity4 after a vote			2
" when they 're voting to just repeal the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , i want to mend it , not end it			1
the bills are ' repeal it , ' with no other solution			2
" as if to prove his point , in its last act before the recess , the @entity24 - controlled @entity23 on friday passed a resolution to prevent the @entity30 from implementing @entity17 -- the 40th time it has voted to repeal , dismantle or defund the @entity17			1
with democrats in control of the @entity35 , the measure has no chance of passing there			2
@entity17 battle heads to states @entity2 , who represents @entity41 's 15th district , which encompasses part of @entity43 and is considered one of the country 's wealthiest , defeated fellow @entity46 rep. @entity46 last year			1
the 32 - year - old was n't yet born when @entity46 was first elected to @entity3 in 1973			1
" new energy , new ideas is what [ my campaign ] was about , " he said			0
" using social media to reach different people			0
" but seven months in , he finds the pace a bit sluggish			0
" it 's frustrating , " he said			0
" i was a prosecutor before i came here , so i would get a case , i would review the evidence , put it in front of a jury , get a verdict			0
here @entity62 put a health care bill in the hopper every year for 50 years before we got health care			2
the place just moves slower than i like			0
" " right now we 're throwing one - yard passes and i want to throw a touchdown			1
" how low can @entity3 go ? @entity2 is also frustrated by some of the archaic practices of the institution and thinks it needs " a serious technological upgrade			1
" " it 's an institution that still operates under many 18th century rules , " he said			2
" and i think we can honor the tradition of the institution and still upgrade the institution and use a lot of technologies that private industry uses			1
" @entity2 is a big proponent of social media and is pushing for @entity3 to use it more , but his @entity86 his " no " vote on a @entity23 bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy broke a @entity23 rule on video recording in the chamber			1
leaders issued a statement stressing the rule but @entity2 stood by his @entity95			1
@entity2 has formed a bipartisan group of about 30 @entity23 freshmen called the @entity98 , which held a forum on thursday in which both the liberal @entity100 and the conservative @entity101 participated			1
then his office threw a barbecue on the balcony			0
to try and get @entity3 to get more work done , @entity2 and and @entity106 rep. @entity106 of @entity107 proposed electronic voting from districts on non-substantive bills , " so , when we 're actually here , ( we can ) do real , substantive work rather than these suspension bills where we 're just stating the sense of @entity3 or allowing the @entity116 to use the @entity4 grounds for the @entity118			1
" @entity1 analysis : @entity3 in @entity0 far less than it used to be on the eve of his last day in session until september , @entity2 prepared to explain to his constituents his frustrations over @entity17 , which both sides expect to be a contentious topic in town hall meetings across the country this year			1
" we 've heard from groups on the left and the right , from business and labor about issues on the @entity17 , but that 's not what we 're voting on			1
and so it 's hard to go back home and say , ' all i 've been able to vote on is something that wants to end it , ' " he said			0
you get these false choices , and there 's a lot more in the middle that i think we could work on			0
" immigration activists are n't taking a recess " i do n't think the @entity150 public realizes that			0
they think you vote on all this stuff , every bill introduced you get to vote on			0
but the truth is you 're kind of set up with these false choices and that 's frustrating			2
" but he 's also looking forward to his return and working with his freshmen classmates to find some middle ground			2
" you just keep trying , " he said			0
" it takes a snowball to create an avalanche			0
we came here to be problem - solvers ; we did n't come here to throw bombs and divide us further			1
so we just need to keep trying			0
" " i 'm not naÃ ¯ ve , " he continued			0
" it 's not going to happen overnight , but i do think there is a spirit , especially among many in the freshman class , that we can get rid of these false choices , the extremes , and try and find real compromise			2
" i do n't want to be a jaded sophomore			0
