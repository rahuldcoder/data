@entity0 -- @entity2 -- the unofficial @entity4 holiday long believed to have been imported , with celebratory beer , from @entity6 -- is n't a @entity8 holiday at all but rather an @entity4 one created by @entity10 in the @entity11 during the @entity12 , according to new research by a @entity15 professor			1
conventional thinking has held that the holiday -- now a commercial juggernaut -- may have grown out of the mass migrations from the bloody @entity23 of the 1910s or even during @entity26 activism of the 1960s , @entity16 at @entity0 professor @entity18 - @entity17 said			1
but on the 150th anniversary of the holiday , @entity18 - @entity17 is announcing that he happened upon the true origins of @entity2 -- the 5th of may -- after poring over @entity32 - language newspapers in @entity15 from the mid- 1800s while working on another research project			1
@entity2 must - haves @entity2 does indeed mark a @entity8 military victory over the invading @entity36 army on may 5 , 1862 , but it 's celebrated more in the @entity4 because in 1862 , @entity4 @entity10 of @entity8 heritage parlayed the victory as a rallying cry that the @entity40 could also win the @entity12			1
that 's because the @entity36 sympathized with the @entity42 , and @entity43 sided with the @entity40 in its fight against slavery and elitism , @entity18 - @entity17 said			1
@entity36 sought to impose a monarchy over democratic @entity6 while @entity4 foreign power weakened during the @entity12			1
savor ' the @entity6 i know ' @entity18 - @entity17 , a @entity50 professor of medicine whose family lore holds his great - great grandfather fought in the famous @entity2 battle , has just published a new book on the discovery , " @entity2 : an @entity4 tradition , " which one historian also at @entity50 describes as " of great significance			1
" @entity18 - @entity17 was culling @entity32 - language newspapers in @entity15 and @entity61 for vital statistics from the 1800s when he noticed how the @entity12 and @entity2 battle were intertwined			2
he researches the epidemiology and demography of @entity10 in @entity15 because he 's director of @entity50 's @entity67 and @entity68			1
" i 'm seeing how in the minds of the @entity32 - reading public in @entity15 that they were basically looking at one war with two fronts , one against the @entity42 in the east and the other against the @entity36 in the south , " @entity17 said in an interview with @entity1			2
" in @entity6 today , @entity2 means the @entity8 army defeated the @entity36 army , " he continued			1
" in @entity15 and @entity61 , the news was interpreted as finally that the army of freedom and democracy won a big one against the army of slavery and elitism			0
and the fact that those two armies had to meet in @entity6 was immaterial because they were fighting for the same issues -- defending freedom and democracy			0
latinos were joining the @entity40 , @entity40 cavalry , @entity92			0
" the @entity36 goal was to eliminate democracy , and remember that @entity6 had democracy only for 30 or 40 years at that point , " he added			0
" remember , @entity96 was ruled mostly by monarchs			0
" @entity36 emperor @entity102 " was no friend of the @entity40 and was definitely a friend of the @entity42 and flirted with the @entity42 constantly with the possible recognition of the @entity42 government , " @entity17 said			1
president @entity104 never referred to the @entity42 as a separate government : they were states in rebellion , " the professor said			0
@entity102 's plan was to instill a monarchy over @entity6 and " have that monarch cooperate with the @entity42 , " @entity17 said			0
in early spring 1862 , the @entity40 army was unable to move against the @entity112 , and @entity4 democracy was " apparently not doing too well , " @entity17 said			1
the @entity36 entry into @entity6 troubled @entity43 , @entity18 - @entity17 said			0
" latinos in @entity15 were reading about every single battle of the @entity12 , " he said			0
" they were very well - informed , and they were reading with a three - week delay of similarly detailed reports from @entity6			0
so by early may , the @entity36 were about 60 miles from @entity120 as some @entity10 feared that the @entity12 might be over			1
" but the @entity8 army prevailed , and the @entity32 - language newspapers in @entity15 reported the victory with such headlines as " @entity125 ! ! ! hurrah for independence ! " in his book , @entity18 - @entity17 writes : " in town after town , camp after camp , mine after mine , ranch after ranch , @entity10 eagerly absorbed the news			1
those who could read shared the glorious details with their illiterate fellows , and up and down the state , @entity10 savored the blow - by - blow reporting from the front lines of the conflict that had so riveted their attention			0
" the @entity2 victory was then memorialized through a network of @entity43 groups called " juntas patrioticas mejicanas , " or @entity8 patriotic assemblies , mostly in @entity15 but also in @entity61 , @entity148 and @entity149 , with 14,000 members , @entity18 - @entity17 said			2
the juntas celebrated @entity2 with monthly parades , speeches , dances , banquets and bull fights as a morale builder for @entity158 and @entity8 president @entity159 , who , despite the @entity2 victory , was subsequently engaged in a three - year struggle against foreign occupation until 1867			2
" from 1862 to 1867 , the public memory of @entity2 was forged in the @entity11 , " @entity17 said			1
briefly after the @entity12 , veterans of the @entity40 and @entity8 armies would put on their uniforms and give speeches every @entity2 , he said			1
but by 1890 , the grandchildren of the veterans and juntas had to be taught about @entity2 , @entity18 - @entity17 said			0
the meaning of the holiday changed over time , becoming a @entity18 versus @entity174 tale among @entity8 immigrants in the 1930s and embodying @entity4 - @entity6 unity during @entity178 and @entity26 in the 1960s and 1970s , @entity18 - @entity17 said			2
in his book , he described @entity2 's " undeniable commercialization in the late 20th century , a fake holiday recently invented by beverage companies			2
" in his interview with @entity1 , @entity18 - @entity17 stated : " now it 's become this big commercial holiday and a wonderful opportunity to get services and products in front of the @entity43 market and it even got its own postage in 1996 and in 2005 president @entity192 even had a @entity2 celebration at the @entity194			2
" but if you ask why is anyone celebrating , no one knows			0
and then you get some people who say it should n't be celebrated at all because it 's a foreign holiday -- and yet it 's as @entity4 a holiday as the @entity203 , " he said			1
" no one has seemed to link it to the @entity12 , " he added about what he called groundbreaking research			0
@entity50 history professor @entity208 said @entity18 - @entity17 's finding is significant			2
" for the general public ( and even for many historians ) , the @entity15 origins of the @entity2 holiday come as quite a surprise ( since the holiday is so generally presumed to be a @entity8 holiday that was only recently imported into the @entity4 ) , " @entity208 said in an e-mail to @entity1			1
" that @entity18 - @entity17 's book ties these origins to the @entity12 is also of great significance			2
" rounding out the new research into @entity2 is @entity17 's family legend that recounts how his great - great - grandfather @entity223 was part of local militia supporting the @entity8 army in the @entity227			1
his ancestor , who hailed from the town of @entity230 just below the snow line on the volcano @entity232 , was taken prisoner but was spared execution by a @entity36 army firing squad after it saw he had a birthmark over his heart			0
the mark was in the shape of a hand with all five fingers clearly visible , @entity18 - @entity17 said			0
the @entity36 firing squad had told the prisoners to remove their shirts because the soldiers intended to use the clothing			0
superstitious of the birth mark , the @entity36 let the man go , @entity18 - @entity17 said			0
on saturday , 150 years later , @entity18 - @entity17 is scheduled to participate in a @entity2 celebration at @entity251 , a @entity253 affiliate in downtown @entity0 .			0

a @entity50 professor of medicine happens upon the true origins of @entity2 , he says in a book
it 's an @entity4 holiday -- not a @entity8 one -- with roots in the @entity12
latinos in the @entity11 cheered @entity8 army 's defeat of @entity36 in 1862
the @entity36 sympathized with @entity42 , and @entity4 @entity10 supported the @entity40
