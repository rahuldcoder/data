@entity0 -- after several years of what it calls broken promises , the @entity3 government has singled out @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 for taking insufficient action against human trafficking			1
in its annual @entity14 ( @entity15 ) report , released friday , the @entity13 downgraded the four nations to tier 3 , the lowest possible ranking it gives for a country 's response to fighting modern - day slavery			1
the report says there is evidence of forced labor and sex trafficking in @entity8 and @entity7			1
it highlights @entity8 's problem with migrants from other @entity29 nations who seek work on farms , factories and construction sites only to be trapped and have their passports taken and wages withheld			1
in @entity7 , the report says , tens of thousands of migrants from neighboring countries are being exploited in the commercial sex industry , on fishing boats or as domestic servants			1
and in @entity10 , women and girls are often lured from poor interior regions to tourist centers with the promise of false job offers			1
when they arrive , they are often forced into prostitution			1
the report ranks governments based on their perceived efforts to acknowledge and combat human trafficking , advance reforms and target resources for prevention , protection and prosecution programs			2
it divides nations into three tiers based on their compliance with 11 " minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking			0
" -- tier 1 countries include governments fully compliant with the minimum standards			2
-- tier 2 countries do n't fully comply , but are making significant efforts to do so			2
( a @entity70 includes countries with a high number of victims , or where the numbers are significantly increasing			2
it also includes countries where there 's insufficient evidence of acceptable efforts to improve anti-trafficking programs )			0
-- tier 3 countries do not fully comply with the minimum standards and have not shown the @entity3 they are making significant efforts to do so			0
a tier 3 status can also mean less money as the @entity3 government may use the designation to withhold or withdraw assistance that is unrelated to trade or humanitarian aid			0
those countries could also face @entity3 opposition in obtaining development aid from international financial institutions like the @entity92 or @entity93			0
more than 20 million people worldwide are believed to be ensnared in some form of human trafficking , according to the @entity97			0
@entity98 , ambassador - at - large of the @entity99 , cited @entity7 and @entity8 's repeated noncompliance in meeting minimum anti-trafficking standards			1
" @entity8 continues to have a victim care regime that basically locks up the victims , " @entity102 said			2
" in @entity7 , we have a lot of beginnings that will hopefully come to fruition , but the report does n't look at promises			1
" in @entity10 , women and girls are often lured from poor interior regions to tourist centers with the promise of false job offers			1
when they arrive , they are often forced into prostitution			2
four other countries had faced possible downgrades to @entity121 -- @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and the @entity125			0
@entity102 said each of those demonstrated over the past year that their governments were serious about stopping human trafficking			0
" in @entity122 , for the first time now , we 're seeing 14 traffickers were convicted			0
we 're even seeing the conviction of soldiers , " says @entity102			0
while the @entity3 puts itself in the @entity136 category , the @entity13 acknowledges its own problems fighting trafficking , something that had n't been done in the report until 2010			1
this year 's report highlights several new groups within the @entity3 that may be vulnerable to traffickers , including teens living on @entity146 reservations and members of the @entity149 community			0
other tier 3 countries are @entity151 ; @entity152 ; @entity153 ; @entity154 ; @entity155 ; @entity156 ; @entity157 ; @entity158 ; @entity159 ; @entity160 ; @entity161 ; @entity162 ; @entity163 ; @entity164 ; @entity165 ; @entity166 ; @entity167 ; @entity168 ; and @entity169 .			0
