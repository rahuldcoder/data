more than 50 million people worldwide currently are refugees , asylum seekers or internally displaced within their own countries , the @entity1 refugee agency said friday , in a new report released to mark @entity6			1
that figure is more than the entire population of @entity9 , @entity10 or @entity11 , or more than double the population of @entity13			0
the 51.2 million registered for 2013 is also 6 million more than the 45.2 million reported in 2012 , according to the @entity15 's annual @entity14 -- a big jump in the wrong direction			1
the huge increase was driven mainly by the war in @entity20 , which at the end of last year had created 2.5 million refugees and displaced another 6.5 million people within @entity20 , the report said			1
major internal displacement was also seen last year in @entity10 , in the @entity25 and @entity26 , where conflicts have taken on an increasingly ethnic nature			0
" we are seeing here the immense costs of not ending wars , of failing to resolve or prevent conflict , " said @entity1 high commissioner for refugees @entity29			1
while humanitarian organizations can provide some relief , he said , " political solutions are vitally needed			0
without this , the alarming levels of conflict and the mass suffering that is reflected in these figures will continue			0
" the latest conflict in @entity44 , where @entity46 extremist fighters are advancing southward toward @entity47 , does n't figure in the report since it covers 2013			2
but more than 1 million people have been displaced by fighting in @entity44 so far this year -- half of them in the past couple of weeks			1
that 's about one in 30 people nationwide who have fled their homes			0
the soaring number of refugees means more demand on the world 's wealthier donor countries to provide aid and on those nations on the front lines to shelter and absorb the refugees			0
@entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity44 have all taken in large numbers of refugees from @entity20 since its 3 - year - old civil war began			1
speaking in @entity71 , @entity72 , on friday , @entity29 warned that if the current conflict in @entity44 worsens , prompting citizens to flee the country , the region will come under even greater strain			0
" looking at the region , one asks ourselves , how can refugees from @entity44 be received in the context of all the other situations that exist around @entity44 ? " he said			2
" so , i hope that this outflow will never come because the capacity of the region to deal with it is practically nonexistent			0
" according to the report , the total number of refugees registered with the @entity15 and its sister organization , the @entity86 for @entity87 , in 2013 totaled 16.7 million			1
the largest populations were from @entity93 , @entity20 and @entity94 -- together accounting for more than half of the global refugee total , the @entity15 said			1
by region , @entity98 and the @entity99 had the largest refugee population overall at 3.5 million people , the report said			2
@entity103 had 2.9 million , while the @entity104 and @entity105 had 2.6 million			0
another 1.1 million people submitted applications for asylum last year , according to the report , the majority of them in developed countries , with @entity114 a favorite			1
asylum seekers from @entity20 lodged the most applications , some 64,000 , followed by the @entity117 and @entity118			2
more than 25,000 asylum applications were filed by children who were on their own or separated from their parents , in what the @entity15 said was a record number			2
there were relatively few refugee returns in 2013 , the report said , totaling fewer than 415,000			0
opinion : deterring and denying asylum seekers in @entity13 @entity44 choking roads to @entity130 fear airstrikes , wanton violence			1

@entity1 registered 51.2 million as refugees , asylum seekers or internally displaced last year
@entity93 , @entity20 and @entity94 make up more than half the total 16.7 million refugees
" we are seeing here the immense costs of not ending wars , " says @entity15 chief
more than a million people have been displaced in @entity44 just this year by violence
