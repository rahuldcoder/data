-- @entity1 saw the first public protests this weekend over the government 's decision to allow cultivation of the first genetically modified corn , which environmentalists and others say could ruin the nation 's native crop			1
a @entity12 banner protesting genetically modified corn hangs on a @entity15 monument on sunday			1
about 45 @entity12 activists hung a black banner and protest signs sunday at the @entity19 , a victory column in a busy traffic circle on one of @entity15 's major thoroughfares			2
it is one of @entity15 's most recognized monuments			0
" today , the @entity19 is in mourning to demand that the @entity1 government protect our principal nourishment -- corn , " said @entity27 , a @entity12 leader at the protest			1
the nation 's agriculture and environment departments approved two permits last week from among 35 applications to grow the controversial crop			1
unlike traditional crops , which are modified through selective breeding , genetically modified crops are engineered by having changes introduced into their dna			1
genetic engineering can improve desired traits such as nutritional content or resistance to herbicides , pests and disease			0
the modifications also can increase tolerance for cold and drought			0
other genetically modified crops include soybeans , cotton and papayas			1
critics of the technique say they worry about the effect on consumers , other crops and the environment			0
@entity65 earlier this year banned a genetically modified strain of corn , saying the government wanted to protect the safety of consumers and the environment			1
@entity1 said the genetically modified crops are in an experimental phase and will be planted on plots controlled by the government and isolated from other crops			1
the new crops also will be planted in states that do not grow native corn , which is a major staple of the @entity1 diet			1
@entity78 is grown on about one - third of the country 's cultivated land , mostly in central @entity1			2
but the @entity1 protesters said they fear the genetically modified corn could harm the nation 's 55 varieties of native corn			1
" without corn , there is no country , " some protesters said			0
the slogan rhymes in @entity91 : " @entity92 , no hay pais			0
" two scientific studies have determined that transgenic corn has already contaminated some native @entity1 corn fields			1
in 2001 , a study in the journal @entity99 reported that transgenic dna had been found in traditional corn crops in the state of @entity103			1
earlier this year , research published in the journal @entity105 also found genetically modified corn contamination of native @entity1 corn			1
signs hung on statues at the protest said : " our corn first , traitors " and " transgenic corn : end to independence			1
" @entity12 and other critics say that modified corn would kill off independent growers , because they would have to buy their seed from one of four businesses that own the patents			1
" farmers will be beholden to those companies when their fields are contaminated and no producer will be able to plant his seed , like they do now , because they will have to pay royalties to those corporations to plant again , " protest leader @entity27 said			2
in its february article , @entity105 said that most of the current crop in the nation comes from private supplies of seed			0
" @entity78 is a staple food in @entity1 , with a pivotal place in the country 's past and present economic , cultural and agricultural spheres , " the article says in its introduction			2
" in contrast to the @entity144 and @entity145 , commercial seed sources account for only one - fourth of the maize seed planted in @entity1			2
furthermore , @entity1 maize is mostly grown by smallholder farmers who obtain seed from their own harvest or from other farmers			2
" @entity105 also points out , though , that the " introduction of transgenic maize has resulted in an increase in maize production			0
" and it is that increase in production that lies at the heart of @entity1 's decision to allow the two test permits , analysts say			2
" @entity1 is a net importer of corn from the @entity144 , " said @entity162 , chairman of the @entity163			1
@entity1 grows two types of corn : yellow , which is similar to that grown in the @entity144 , and white , which is native to @entity1			1
the native white corn amounts to roughly 90 percent of the nation 's production			0
yellow corn makes up the remaining 10 percent			0
white corn is used for human consumption while yellow corn is used primarily for animal feed			0
an increase in meat and chicken consumption in @entity1 in the past decade has led to greater demand for yellow corn for animal feed			2
unable to meet this demand , @entity1 has had to import about 89 percent of the corn it needs for feed , says the @entity144 @entity186			2
and 99.8 percent of that corn comes from the @entity144 , the department says			0
" @entity1 wants to produce enough crops so they do n't have to import foods , " said @entity189 , director of the @entity190 at the @entity163			2
" @entity194 yields will lead to not having to import as much food from the @entity144			0
" there are other factors , such as increasingly common food shortages throughout the world that have driven up prices			0
the price of corn , for example , has more than doubled since 2007			0
that prompted about 70,000 people to take to the streets of @entity1 last year to protest the price of tortillas , which jumped through the roof in january 2008			0
" @entity1 is feeling the pangs of food insecurity , " @entity162 said			0
greater corn production and less importation also would ease the nation 's balance of payments			0
@entity162 also sees another reason why @entity1 may have allowed introduction of the genetically modified corn			1
the @entity144 has pressured @entity1 strongly to accept the modified crop , @entity162 said			2
@entity1 has acquiesced due to provisions in the @entity221			0
but if the experimental plots lead to greater contamination of native crops , @entity162 said , @entity1 could have the legal grounds to refuse widespread importation of the new corn			1
@entity12 does n't want to wait that long			0
the global environmental organization asked @entity1 for an immediate moratorium on the use of the transgenic corn			1
there has been no indication they 're likely to get it any time soon .			0

@entity1 last week approved two applications to grow genetically modified corn
@entity12 , other environmentalists say the altered crops could ruin native corn
government says modified crops are an experiment , will be isolated from other fields
studies show transgenic corn has already contaminated some @entity1 corn fields
