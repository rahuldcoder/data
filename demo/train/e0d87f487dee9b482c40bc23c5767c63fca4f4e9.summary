@entity0 -- @entity2 , the last @entity3 leader , called wednesday for new parliamentary elections in @entity5 over concerns about vote fraud			1
" @entity2 is very concerned about how the situation in @entity5 is developing , " spokesman @entity8 told @entity1			1
" people do n't believe that the will of the people is reflected in the results			0
" he confirmed a report by the @entity5 news agency @entity16 , which quoted the former @entity18 general secretary as saying the elections were unfair and new elections were needed			1
demonstrators have been protesting against what they describe as electoral fraud in sunday 's national vote , which kept @entity5 prime minister @entity26 's party in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in @entity31			1
opponents of @entity26 vowed to continue protesting the election results despite the arrests of at least 250 demonstrators tuesday			1
however , a planned opposition rally in @entity0 failed to materialize wednesday , with a heavy security presence in the square where thousands of demonstrators were expected to march , but no visible protesters			1
organizers had expected about 2,000 people for the demonstration , they said earlier wednesday			0
rights group @entity44 said in a statement that @entity5 authorities " must halt police mistreatment of election protesters , journalists and detainees " before further planned rallies			1
nearly 16,000 people have already said on @entity54 they will demonstrate in @entity0 on saturday , which would be one of the largest opposition protests in the @entity5 capital in years			1
@entity44 said more than 1,000 people , including journalists , had reportedly been detained following election protests , of whom possibly more than 100 remain in detention			2
it had received numerous reports of mistreatment of detainees and beatings of peaceful protesters by police , the group said , with some denied medical treatment			1
" the scale of arrests has not been in any way justified , " said @entity71 , @entity44 's deputy director for @entity72 and @entity73			2
" we fear that the @entity5 police are simply quashing opposition protest , no matter how peaceful			1
" some protesters at opposition rallies have been arrested " simply for shouting ' @entity82 ' or ' we need another @entity5 , ' " he said , while pro-government supporters gathered in the same location have been left untouched			1
@entity86 , a former deputy prime minister turned vocal government opponent , told @entity1 he was among those detained at a rally tuesday			0
@entity26 's @entity91 party held a separate demonstration			1
police said there were about 8,000 people there			0
tuesday 's @entity98 protests drew much smaller crowds than a similar rally in @entity0 monday , where thousands of demonstrators turned out for an event state news agency @entity103 described as the largest opposition demonstration in years			1
protesters tuesday were met with a firm response from security forces , who dispersed many and made arrests			0
but some analysts said the presence of protesters was a significant sign that could prove a turning point in @entity5 politics			2
" this is n't a surprise that the party got fewer votes			0
i think the real surprise are the number of people who went out on the street , " said @entity121 , a senior international adviser at the @entity123 firm			0
as simmering anger over allegations of official corruption and economic stagnation appear to be boiling over			0
@entity26 has promised to make changes , including reshuffling his cabinet			0
he said the losses his party suffered in sunday 's elections were inevitable			2
" they are unavoidable for any political power , especially a political power that has held the responsibility for the state of a country for some time , " he said after results were announced			0
one observer said sunday 's election results , which left @entity91 with a slim majority in the 450 - seat house , signal that the leader 's grip on power was weakening			1
" whatever else they reveal , sunday 's results undercut the image , common in the @entity159 , of @entity26 's regime as an effective authoritarian state , " @entity151 , professor of political science at the @entity153 , @entity154 , wrote in a column for @entity1			1
" in fact , it is a regime that can not even steal an election decisively			0
" but @entity165 , deputy director of the @entity5 and @entity166 at the @entity167 , cautioned that this week 's protests were fueled by the frustrations of a " liberal fringe , " not the majority of the population			2
" the bulk of @entity5 ... still have negative memories of the last time a government went down			0
they 're not terribly interested in feeding chaos , " he said			0
" it 's not the @entity180 on the streets of @entity0			2
" a preliminary report from the @entity183 on sunday 's election said some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was " slanted in favor of the ruling party			2
" a draft report by the organization 's election - observer mission details alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes , manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors			0
the group , which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights , cited the lack of an independent body running the election or impartial news media			0
and there was " undue interference of state authorities " in the vote , the 56 - nation organization said in a statement			0
@entity26 's @entity91 party will have 238 seats , down from more than 300 in the outgoing @entity31 , or @entity213 , @entity210 head @entity209 announced , with 99.99 % of ballots counted			1
meanwhile , the @entity18 will have 92 seats , @entity216 will have 64 , and the @entity217 will have 56 , @entity209 said			0
@entity1 's @entity218 contributed to this report from @entity0 ; @entity220 and @entity221 reported from @entity222 ; @entity223 reported from @entity224 .			2
