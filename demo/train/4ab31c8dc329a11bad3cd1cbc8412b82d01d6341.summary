-- " if you build it , they will come			0
" a very overused , but very apt quote for my take on @entity5 following my first visit to the @entity8 host city of next year 's @entity9			1
the @entity5 2014 organizers have taken @entity11 's @entity13 quote literally , except their film has a soundtrack of constant drilling , banging , and the grinding of rocks			1
@entity8 rubble the @entity21 resort seems a million miles from the one i 'd read about			1
more the @entity23 than the @entity8 @entity24			1
i 've never seen so much construction on such a large scale in one place			1
hundreds of workers in orange bibs working in shifts on construction sites 24 hours a day , seven days a week			1
they 're building roads , train lines , hotels , promenades , and harbors in the coastal @entity39 area -- and in the mountain location in @entity41 as well , which is 40 kilometers inland			0
as one local driver put it : " they build and build			0
there is no end to it			0
and then -- where is what they build ? " @entity0 's aiming for @entity53 team spent five days in @entity5 , after which it 's difficult not to have some sympathy with him			1
traffic trouble every journey we took , the road layout changed around the construction			1
a journey from the hotel to @entity5 took 45 minutes one way but took double on the way back after we were caught out by another diversion			1
the disruption to the lives of @entity5 's residents is immense			1
it 's dangerous to walk along many of the ( alleged ) roads , for danger of falling down an uncovered man hole			0
from inside my hotel room you could n't fail to hear the nine nearby cranes going about their business night and day and leaving a thick layer of dust covering everything in sight			0
but this is all a means to an end -- an end which is just five months away			0
it 's the biggest international sporting event to ever come to the region and many of the locals are acutely aware of its significance			0
watching world one lady told us : " it 's a great thing that such a big thing will happen right in our yard			0
all these sportsmen will come -- the whole world will be here -- can you believe it ? " the importance is n't lost on the organizers either			1
if it is the daily 1am progress report with the government is guaranteed to see to that			0
and in their mind there 's no doubt things wo n't be ready			1
the man in charge @entity114 told me that the @entity9 would be " one of the brightest moments in the history of modern @entity8			1
" they 're aiming to shatter stereotypes but says : " we 're not over confident , we 're just delivering what we promised in accordance with our commitment			1
" on track although the @entity5 airport upgrade has been completed we still had to wait over an hour for our bags at the carousel after our flight from @entity131			1
the brand new train line to link the coastal area with the mountains is still under construction -- as are a large number of the roads			1
however the buildings for the two athletes villages are in place			0
the 508 room hotel and @entity142 -- complete with three swimming pools , tennis court & spa , which will house the @entity146 -- is finished			0
twenty thousand new hotel rooms have been guaranteed , but the @entity149 team planning representatives who we bumped into said they 've been told five of the promised hotels will now not materialize			0
the many areas which looked like chaos to my untrained eye have been described by the organizing committee as simply requiring finishing touches			0
ready for action across the building sites , pavements were emerging , walkways were being flattened , trees were being planted			1
perhaps no surprise with 70,000 workers on the job			0
in terms of the sporting venues , there 's no denying it seems they could host the @entity173 tomorrow			1
all 10 of them have been newly built -- and they do n't just look great , they 've all successfully held a number of high profile test events already			2
the pre-games test program has included more than 70 events in all @entity182 and @entity183 sports -- with the press briefing notes proudly declaring their program has been three times bigger than the one in @entity187 four years ago			2
they 're not tinpot events either			2
they have included the speed skating world championships , the @entity194 alpine skiing @entity192 and 12 @entity196 stages			2
from our tour of the venues , it appears that the early preparation seems to have paid off			0
there was a medal podium , flags , a full ice rink and even pot plants inside the @entity208 arena , home to the speed skating events			2
late decision the tall structures and semi-permanent marquees were going up on the concourse of the @entity215			0
the only coastal venue with major construction still ongoing is the stadium for the opening & closing ceremony -- largely as a result of the late decision to build a roof			2
as manager of the @entity224 said : " we can only put our feet up when the @entity173 end and the last athletes leave the village , but we are as ready as we can be			1
" up in the mountains , it 's the same story			0
the @entity232 alpine center , @entity234 sliding center and @entity236 cross country and biathlon center have all held test events of their own with the structures firmly in place			1
however it does n't take a genius to realize there 's one vital ingredient missing from these venues			0
much has been made of the madness of hosting a @entity9 at a seaside resort			0
admittedly it 's only september -- but our cameraman @entity251 had no problems filming at the highest point ( 2,300m ) in just a t - shirt			0
last february did organizers no favors either			1
it was the warmest on record , with some of the alpine test events canceled due to rain			1
@entity263 fears it 's for this reason @entity5 has undertaken the biggest snow storage operation ever			1
they 've got nine epic aluminum covered snow slugs resting on the rocky mountainsides , like something from an alien occupied lunar landscape			2
it 's what 's been stored from last winter -- just in case			0
snow making equipment has also been installed on the mountains			2
the team are resolute that they wo n't need it			0
we met the man in charge who hails from @entity286 -- @entity288 aka mr @entity287 -- halfway up the mountain			0
he certainly does n't look like he 's having sleepless nights over it			0
" i 'm not worried at all , " he said			0
" i 'm very confident			2
we guarantee we will have snow			2
there might be a lack of snow , but there may be too much snow			2
we are prepared for both scenarios			2
" it 's a good bet that the sun is set to shine on @entity5 once again come february			1
but from what we 've seen on our first trip here organizers are doing all they can to make sure this @entity21 resort does the same as it plays host to the @entity307 .			1

the @entity8 city of @entity5 will host the @entity307 in february
hundreds of works still working on construction *ahead* of the @entity173
organizers confident that all work will be ready on time
snow storage operation underway to ensure alpine events will be fully prepared
