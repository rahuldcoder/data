@entity3 , who died on june 25 of what the coroner found to be a deadly combination of drugs , " lost the will to live , i think he was just going through the motions of life toward the end , " @entity11 told @entity28			1

helping children enjoy their childhood is his mission , @entity3 said			1
" i feel that this is something really , really in my heart that i am supposed to do , and i feel so loved by giving my love , and i know that 's what they need , " he said			2

" he 's special , " @entity3 said			1
@entity11 asked @entity3 whether by speaking to people like the boy " part of the pain goes away for them			1
" " absolutely , " @entity3 said			2
" because every time i talk to him he is in better spirits			2
when i spoke to him last night he said , ' i need you			2
when are you coming home ? ' i said , ' i do n't know			0
' he said , ' i need you , @entity3			2
' then he calls me ' @entity98			0
' " @entity3 's taped statements about his father 's treatment of him as a child echoed what he has said previously			1
" he was rough , the way he would beat you , you know , was hard , " @entity3 said			1
" he would make you strip nude first			2
he would oil you down			0
it would be a whole ritual			0
he would oil you down so when the flip of an ironing cord hit you , you know , and , it was just like me dying , and you had whips all over your face , your back , everywhere			0
and i always hear my mother like , ' no , @entity44 , you 're gon na kill him			0
you 're gon na kill him			0
no. ' and i would just give up , like there was nothing i could do			0
and i hated him for it			0

he did suggest he used spankings for disciplining his children			0
another @entity3 quote from the book alleged emotional abuse by @entity44 : " @entity130 bless my father because he did some wonderful things and he was brilliant , he was a genius , but one day he said , ' if you guys ever stop singing i will drop you like a hot potato			1
you would think he would think , ' these kids have a heart and feelings			0
' would n't he think that would hurt us ? if i said something like that to @entity146 and @entity147 , that would hurt			0
you do n't say something like that to children and i never forgot it			0
it affects my relationship with him today			0
" @entity3 told @entity11 he was still " scared of my father to this day			1
" " my father walked in the room -- and @entity130 knows i am telling the truth -- i have fainted in his presence many times			2
i have fainted once to be honest			0
i have thrown up in his presence because when he comes in the room and this aura comes and my stomach starts hurting and i know i am in trouble			0
he is so different now			0
time and age has changed him and he sees his grandchildren and he wants to be a better father			2
it is almost like the ship has sailed its course , and it is so hard for me to accept this other guy that is not the guy i was raised with			0
i just wished he had learned that earlier			0
" in the excerpts provided to @entity2 by the book 's publisher , there were no quotes from @entity3 discussing his drug use , but @entity11 does write about what he saw during the several years he was @entity44 's spiritual adviser , starting in 1999			1
while @entity11 said he never personally saw @entity3 use drugs , he did suspect it			1
" in the time that i knew him , he always seemed intent on me having a positive view of him and nothing untoward was ever done in my presence , " he wrote			0
while their close relationship ended around the time of the molestation charges , @entity11 said @entity3 's parents reached out to him later for help in convincing him to enter drug rehab			1
" perhaps i could inspire @entity3 to make that decision , and his parents thought i could at least help , " @entity11 said			1
" but i knew they were wrong			0
@entity3 had long since ceased taking my counsel			2
he found my advice too demanding			0
i was an irritant and was treated as such			0
" he said he told @entity44 and @entity200 that " it was imperative for them to save their son 's life by becoming available parents in his greatest hour of need			1
" sometimes those closest to @entity3 were not people -- but mannequins , the book said			1
@entity3 said he was so shy at times he surrounded himself with dummies			2
" because i felt i needed people , someone , and i did n't have , " he said			0
" i was too shy to be around real people			0
" @entity11 , in the @entity28 interview friday , said it made his skin crawl to hear that			2
" his celebrity had created a degree of isolation where he could not simply feel comfortable around other people , " @entity11 said			2
" he thought that everybody wanted something from him			0
he felt that he was trapped in this cocoon of fame and that there was some exploitative relationship with virtually everyone that he met			0
" the book does offer insight into @entity3 's dating of celebrity women , including actress @entity18			1
" that was one of the loves of my life , " @entity3 said			1
" i just wished she loved me as much as i loved her , you know			0
" he told @entity11 one problem he had with women was their jealousy of his fame			1
" they admire you and know you 're wonderful and great , but just they 're jealous because they wish they were in your place , with they were in your shoes			0
and 'm ' is one of them -- @entity17			0
hate to say that on tape			0
" @entity2 asked @entity17 's publicist @entity255 for a response : " @entity17 was very fond of @entity3 ( as she clearly expressed in her tribute to him at the @entity258 's ) and i doubt anything in the book will change her mind , " @entity255 said			1
