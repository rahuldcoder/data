-- dazzling beaches , pulsing jungles , rich underwater life and friendly locals greet visitors to the @entity8 ' @entity7 province , made up of about 1,700 islands along the country 's western edge			1
a top destination for nature lovers , @entity12 describes @entity7 as " a magnificent , coral - fringed range of jungle - clad mountainous islands jutting up dramatically from the @entity17			1
" @entity18 , 22 , recently visited friends serving in the @entity20 in @entity7			1
@entity21 , currently living in @entity22 , @entity23 , was struck by the contrast between the area 's poverty and its remarkable natural beauty			2
she answered six questions about her experience on @entity31 : @entity32 not - to - be - missed experience			2
why ? riding the bus from @entity35 up through the heart of the island to @entity38 , at the northern shore ... it 's the ultimate @entity8 experience : crowded into a small dirty bus with open windows and beautiful people of all ages and stories			2
plus you have time to marvel at the rugged beauty , squalor , and everything in between			0
first impression , and did it change ? waiting for a connecting flight from @entity52 to @entity35 , i came face - to - face with this sign on the back of a bathroom stall : " life is a process not a destination , a mystery to be lived , not a problem to be solved			0
" it was the perfect motto to confront after a stressful week at work and mad rush to the airport that morning			0
i walked out of the bathroom and looked out the huge windows of the airport , across the runway to the green hills and palms beyond			0
and i knew that this would be a life - changing adventure			0
my impression did n't change , and i consider my time in @entity7 a very worthwhile education			1
share your trips on @entity31 : just back from lasting memory discovering hidden lagoons , caves , islands , and seeing my first in - the - wild sea turtle while snorkeling off @entity83 and @entity38			2
three adjectives that capture this place engaging , enigmatic , diverse biggest surprise wow , dirt roads and motorcycle taxis in the island 's capital ? this is third world ! but these boys are the most adorable and respectful shuttle drivers i 've ever had ! i did indeed love it , but traveling with @entity97 [ volunteers ] and through the rural @entity8 is hard work ! it 's well worth it , though			1
i did n't want the typical @entity103 beach resort experience , and i surely did n't get it ! most delicious food , drink or place to eat stuffed squid in @entity38 was memorable , mango and avocado shakes were divine , and one of the best cottages and kitchens of all was @entity113 in @entity83			1
overlooking the old fort and the bay , they served us lomi ( noodles ) , adobo , pizza , and @entity122 [ beer ] as the living jungle around us hummed into the wee small hours			0
