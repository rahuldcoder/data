campus politics are n't always a clear winner for @entity2 , as he discovered here this week during an appearance at the @entity4			1
the @entity6 @entity5 and potential 2016 contender opened with a familiar riff about government surveillance that won predictable applause -- especially from the many students who represented @entity12 , the libertarian outfit created from the ashes of his father @entity14 's presidential campaigns			1
then a young woman in the audience asked if @entity14 , who sponsored an anti-abortion bill in 2013 that defines life as beginning at fertilization , is opposed to @entity23 , the emergency contraception commonly known as the morning - after pill			1
a number of social conservatives -- plenty of them in @entity28 -- have condemned the morning - after pill as an on - demand abortion drug , sometimes confusing the contraceptive with @entity32 , which can be used to induce abortion			0
noticeably uncomfortable with the question , @entity14 first gave a terse answer : " i am not opposed to birth control , " he said			1
after a pause , he elaborated			0
" that 's basically what @entity23 is			0
@entity23 is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening , and i am not opposed to that			0
" @entity2 : ' i am not opposed to birth control ' next question			1
the exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus -- a place where @entity14 has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda			1
and it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him : burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he does n't stray so far from the @entity5 line that he wo n't be able to win the party 's presidential nomination			1
another student here pressed him on " the drug war , " asking if @entity14 would support legalizing marijuana , cocaine and heroin			1
he said he was n't supportive of drug use , explaining that pot " is not that great , " but said drug laws should be left up to states			0
@entity75 and @entity76 are experimenting with legalized marijuana , he said , and we should be watching carefully			0
@entity14 has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit			1
his visits to universities from @entity84 to @entity85 have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from @entity5 who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal			1
" @entity2 , @entity5 presidential hopeful , finds support in @entity92 , of all places , " the @entity93 announced after @entity14 visited in that den of @entity96 liberalism in march			1
@entity14 , reared in libertarian politics , found support there because he railed against the @entity102 's invasive surveillance operations , calling them an absurd violation of privacy			1
it 's his go - to topic when he talks to young people			1
last march , at the annual @entity109 , @entity14 blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20 - somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones			1
soon after , he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee			2
@entity14 and his wife , @entity123 , danced and sang along to @entity124 , the 90s - era pop band with an anarchist streak			2
we tagged along to the event at the @entity4 for the latest episode of " @entity129			0
" after the talk , standing in the sun - splashed campus courtyard , i asked @entity14 to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people â€” as well as the thorny topics that @entity14 confronts as he tries to square with small - government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic @entity5			1
on the topic of drugs , i picked up where the student left off , wondering if @entity14 , as president , would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin			2
" my position has not been for legalization , my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this , and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance , " he said			2
then i asked about same - sex marriage , something @entity14 did not touch on in his remarks			2
almost 80 % of people under the age of 30 support same - sex marriage , according to a @entity166 poll earlier this year			2
it 's hard to think of an issue on which @entity5 are more out of step with @entity171 's youth			2
and it 's not just teenaged and 20 - somethings : a clear majority of @entity171 , 55 % , support same - sex marriage			0
@entity14 favors traditional marriage , but has said states should determine their own marriage laws			2
" i do n't want my guns registered in @entity76 or my marriage , " he told me			0
" @entity182 all got married by going down to the local courthouse			0
it is a local issue and always has been			0
" but can @entity5 win a national election if they are n't in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter ? he took a soft tone			2
" @entity191 's changing , " he said			0
" i mean , people change their minds all the time on this issue , and even within the @entity5 , there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they 're like , oh well maybe i want to rethink this issue			1
so it 's been rethought			0
the president 's rethought the issue			0
so i mean , a lot of people have rethought the issue			0
" it sounded , for a moment , as if @entity14 was hinting that he , too , could change his thinking about marriage			2
" the bottom line is , i 'm old fashioned , i 'm a traditionalist , " he said			0
" i believe in old - fashioned traditional marriage			0
but , i do n't really think the government needs to be too involved with this , and i think that the @entity5 can have people on both sides of the issue			1
" " you could rethink it at some point , too ? " i asked him			0
he shrugged , and gave me a half - grimace			0
it was n't a yes or a no , but it revealed @entity14 's complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the @entity5 .			1

@entity2 is visiting many college campuses to advance his libertarian agenda
@entity14 faces a challenge in wooing young people without *alienating* other *republicans*
