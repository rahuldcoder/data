-- in elementary school , i was the only kid in my class whose favorite @entity4 was @entity6			2
later , i was the only one of my girlfriends who chose @entity10 as her favorite @entity11			2
in other words , i have a thing for the runt of the litter			0
and the current runt of the pop culture litter is @entity18 , the one who nobody picks as their favorite " @entity22 " character			1
the @entity0 : the 10 worst tv moms as much as i love to loathe the show , i 've always liked @entity18 's character the best			1
i ca n't relate to rich women who quit their jobs when they get married , underpaid writers who waste all their money on shoes instead of investing in a 401 ( k ) , or chicks who are interested in a new dude every 10 minutes			2
but @entity18 ? she 's a human being who could actually exist in real life , not just on a fancy , fluffy tv show			1
she was often imperfect or badly dressed , and sometimes she said dumb stuff on dates			1
sadly , it 's her humanity that makes her the least appealing to many people			0
if entertainment is aspirational , no woman wants to see a fictionalized version of herself			0
the @entity0 : @entity45 says he " wanted to get caught " mirandas are not as vocal as @entity47 or as bold as @entity48 , but we 're out there			0
as a @entity18 , i tend to date beta males , focus almost to the point of obsession on my career , wear shoes that are more practical than sexy , and proudly call myself a feminist			1
i 'm also fond of dark humor ( how @entity18 managed to stand @entity60 's perpetually sunny demeanor i will never understand )			1
while she often came off as " the angry one , " she was capable of incredible empathy and kindness			0
i challenge anyone to watch the scenes of her caring for @entity68 's elderly mother and not feel the same way			0
[ @entity70 ] in " @entity71 , " she does something she 's needed to do for ages : she quits her corporate law firm gig for a low - key job that will enable her to spend more time with her friends and family			1
in terms of attaining work - life balance , @entity18 does it the best of them all			1
is n't that everyone 's dream ? the @entity0 : stars who are way opposite of the characters they play of all the " girls , " @entity18 is the only one i can see myself hanging out with in real life			1
it would n't be a contest to see who could come up with the craziest outfit or drink the most ridiculous cocktails at an overpriced trendy nightspot			0
we 'd hang out at home , rent movies to snark on , and eat junk food without feeling guilty ( even if it came from out of the trash can )			0
in other words ? i 'm a @entity18 , and i 'm proud of it			2
i may not be the most glamorous girl at the party , but i always have a good time			0
i know which people in my life i can count on , and my feet hurt way less at the end of the night			0
