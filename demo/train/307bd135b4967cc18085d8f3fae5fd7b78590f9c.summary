@entity0 , @entity1 -- it really does n't look like much , this mission control			1
about a dozen tables with monitors , men in the standard issue white lab coats			0
but this is @entity1 's nerve center			1
from here scientists will be able to monitor their rocket when they try to fire a satellite into orbit			1
our government minders have brought us here to the outskirts of the capital @entity0			2
it is all about access , this secretive regime opening its doors to the world 's media -- @entity2 included -- to answer one question : is this a missile or a satellite ? the head of the control center is huddled into a corner of the room , a crush of cameras around him			1
i manage to squeeze through to the front , literally straddling the sitting reporter in front of me			0
rocket fueling under way " after all your denials that this is not a missile test , i ask , why does the @entity45 not believe you ? " my question brings a wry smile to his lips			1
" the @entity45 people are very confused , " he says			2
" the @entity45 says basically you 're lying , why should they trust you " ? i ask			2
" this is why we have invited you here , " he replies before adding that he hopes the media can become supporters of the @entity1 cause			1
independent analysts though are still not totally convinced			0
they point to the technology itself			0
the rocket could easily be used for a missile as well as a satellite			1
" potentially yes , it can carry a warhead , " says @entity67 space policy expert @entity65			0
" the nuclear warhead can be the same size as a suitcase ( so ) it is possible to deliver it , but in this case i believe it is a satellite , "			0
@entity76 is a @entity1 specialist from the @entity77 in the @entity45 , and he 's also been invited as an observer by @entity0			1
he says this is all about trust			0
he trusts them but he does have questions			0
" is it a satellite or a missile ? ultimately it is n't about science , but the motives of @entity1 , " he says			1
there 's a lot riding on this rocket launch			1
it has essentially scuttled a much needed food aid deal with the @entity45 and is raising tensions in an already volatile @entity95			2
but in the last few days it has become clear that this is not just about technology , this is a spiritual quest , this is about honoring the memory of the founding father of the nation , @entity102			0
this week @entity1 mark 100 years since his birth			2
when the rocket reaches for the skies , the people here will praise a man they see as a god .			0
