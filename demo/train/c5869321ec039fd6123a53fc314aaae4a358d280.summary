-- i 'm a big fan of @entity2 's , but if she 's going to be hitting the circuit to raise money for @entity5 , she has to be prepared for heckling			1
especially heckling from gay rights activists like the one who interrupted her speech tuesday night			1
" lesbian looking for federal equality before i die			1
" that 's how @entity12 , the woman identified as the heckler , identified herself			0
apparently the first lady 's husband said something about signing an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity			1
@entity12 had the nerve to ask the president to keep his word			2
and it 's not like signing an order will rock @entity27 's world -- as the @entity28 pointed out , of the " employees of federal contractors that are in the @entity31 , 92 % are already protected by a company - wide sexual orientation nondiscrimination policy , and 58 % are already protected by a gender identity nondiscrimination policy			1
" still president @entity35 made a promise : it 's not unreasonable to expect him to keep it			2
especially when one out of every 16 of his " bundlers " -- those who organize super fund - raisers -- during the 2012 election was openly gay			2
the @entity28 says of his top 2012 bundlers , one in six was gay			2
and that more than 75 % of voters who identified as lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender voted for him			1
and yet the changes @entity2 has wrought since he was first elected often feel as if they 're being handed out like doggie treats , and not championed with the same urgency that @entity5 showed on the campaign trail			1
heckling the first lady was n't fair because she is n't responsible for policy			1
but the incident sent a message to those who are responsible : we are people , not pawns			0
but this is what happens when a bloc of voters -- be it the @entity66 , latinos , women -- surrenders its voting power to a political party as opposed to a principle			2
not all republicans are anti-gay , not all @entity5 are pro , and it 's the rare politician who will do something " bold " that is n't politically expedient			1
in @entity77 , the @entity76 , controlled 71 - 47 by @entity5 , chose not to vote on same - sex marriage legislation , with some members saying they needed to talk it over with their constituents			1
a rationale that does n't hold much water because the @entity84 passed the bill 34 - 21 in february			0
state sen. @entity86 , a @entity87 , voted in support of same - sex marriage after adding a religious liberty amendment to the bill			0
many activists are pointing fingers at the @entity94 for not playing ball			0
this seems ironic , considering the first item under the subject line " what are they fighting for ? " is civil equality			2
state rep. @entity102 , chairman of the @entity94 , did not return my calls			0
but he did tell the @entity105 that it was unfair to pin the bill 's failure on the caucus , adding , " this is not the @entity94 ' burden			2
" because lord knows black folks have nothing to do with gay folks , right @entity116 ? @entity117 , the @entity118 ' national executive director , told me that " if there 's any lesson to learn from this is that @entity5 ca n't pass marriage equality on their own			1
" and the @entity125 community would be wise to remember that			2
the @entity87 may house the most vocal , and sometimes offensive , opponents -- but that does n't mean that all @entity5 are proponents or courageous enough to fight			1
the @entity130 in @entity131 became the first legislative caucus in the country , of either party , to vote unanimously for same - sex marriage			0
the truth is the @entity77 @entity5 promised to bring the bill to a vote and they did n't			1
it 's likely they are stalling to see what the @entity141 @entity140 decides in the two same - sex marriage cases it heard this spring			0
decisions are expected later this month			0
the @entity94 has until august 31 to vote			0
this is a little political cover that may be smart but flies in the face of the party 's national platform : " we oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same - sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples			1
" but @entity5 have trampled on that promise before , and fairly recently			1
in 2009 , sen. @entity162 of @entity163 said he supported marriage for same - sex couples			0
but he recently opposed an amendment to the immigration reform bill that would have included same - sex couples because he thought it would make republicans kill the bill			0
the democrats on the @entity173 did n't even want to vote on it			0
@entity175 wants same - sex couples to get married in his home state -- but if you 're binational , he 'll let the government deport your spouse			0
so the lgbt community gets tossed under the bus -- again -- as if our families are not worth voting for			1
as if we do n't deserve a public record of which @entity186 is for us and which is against us			0
heckling mrs. @entity2 was n't fair to her			0
but taking the lgbt community for granted is n't fair to us either			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

first lady heckled by " lesbian looking for federal equality before i die "
@entity190 : heckling unfair , but president vowed to sign order on federal contractors
he says in @entity77 , on immigration , @entity5 seem to back off from promises to gay community
@entity190 : gays and lesbians first ones to be thrown under a bus for political expediency
