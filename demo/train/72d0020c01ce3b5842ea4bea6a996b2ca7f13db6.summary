@entity0 -- on a warm , late summer evening , @entity2 readies himself atop patchy grass and waits			0
at the sound of his coach 's whistle , the 12 - year - old charges a tee , kicking a football and dirt into the setting sun. despite the less - than - desirable field conditions , @entity2 and his fellow teammates from the @entity16 are fired up			1
they 're excited because the youth football program is getting a much - needed boost from a local hero			1
the @entity16 practice on a field at the center of @entity24 in the heart of @entity0			1
instead of playing on gridiron befitting of national champions , their home field is a dust bowl -- and sometimes a lake , depending on the weather			1
the field is in such poor condition they have n't hosted a home game in 19 years			2
" i feel very upset because we have to go to a high school and we ca n't just play here , " said eighth - grader @entity36 , 13			2
but this week , the @entity16 -- the first inner - city youth football team to win a @entity41 championship -- got word they 're getting a new field , compliments of @entity46 ' quarterback @entity44			1
on tuesday , the newly formed @entity47 announced that its first major gift totaling $ 200,000 goes to the @entity16 for a new field			1
@entity44 , who spent about 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges in 2007 , said the donation is a gift to the @entity54 for embracing him after the @entity46 signed him following his release from prison			2
" it 's important because the kids mean a lot , i think , and the @entity0 community deserves that			2
when i first got here they embraced me and it 's something that i 'll never forget , " @entity44 said			1
the former @entity65 player got his start in football growing up in @entity68			0
although watching the @entity16 play brings back memories for the football giant , @entity44 said he wants them to learn from his mistakes			1
" do everything that you can , you know , to stay on the right path			0
that 's where it all starts			0
other than that , football is obsolete ; it does n't matter , " he said			0
" you are what you eat ... and they have to understand that perception is just as big as reality			0
" the new football field is the capstone project for the $ 4 million revitalization effort led by the @entity90 , a small but mighty nonprofit working to improve the city 's vast park system			1
other sport legends signed on to help the troubled @entity24 , including the @entity96 ' @entity95 and tennis great @entity97			1
since renovations began , the park has seen a new baseball field , tennis courts , playgrounds and a community garden complete with farmer 's market			2
" it has literally been a coalition of champions , an army of champions if you will , who are helping to lift this project up and make it successful , " said @entity107 , executive director of @entity90			0
" this park became a real liability			0
people avoided it at all costs			0
" once part of the estate of @entity123 , who was state founder @entity124 's secretary , the 87 - acre @entity24 went from a destination point in the 1940s and ' 50s to a place riddled with crime and drugs			2
things got so bad one city official was skeptical of a turnaround			0
" my skepticism , not my participation , but my skepticism was blown out of the water early on			0
i think this is one of the most remarkable comebacks in my 30 years of public service that i 've seen anywhere , " said @entity137 , commissioner of @entity138			0
" ( @entity44 's ) attraction to the neighborhood really says a lot about who he is , what he cares about and how he views himself in the world			1
" at @entity24 , the @entity16 use football as a positive outlet for youth hailing from some of the city 's toughest neighborhoods , something head coach @entity155 said he wants to last			1
@entity155 , who played football growing up and even played on the same field in @entity24 , said the @entity16 program went from three teams in 1994 to eight teams today , serving close to 400 young people from ages 5 to 15			1
" i 've seen some good kids come , i have seen some kids that are no longer with us and some kids get caught up in the wrong things , " @entity155 said			0
" the park gets a second chance , the kids get a second chance and @entity44 got a second chance			2
so , it 's meant to be , a match made in heaven			0

@entity44 's nonprofit has donated $ 200,000 to build the team a new field
