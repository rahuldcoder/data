" @entity36 , which is monitoring humanitarian conditions in the area , warned thursday that the fall of @entity11 to the rebels poses " a very real risk of complete collapse of state authority and the humanitarian crisis reaching new depths			1
" it estimates that 120,000 people are in urgent need of help , with many sleeping in the open or in schools and other buildings without humanitarian aid			0
" people are living in chaotic conditions , " said @entity52 , @entity36 's humanitarian coordinator			1
" there are real fears that cholera and other fatal water - borne diseases could spread , as shortages of power and water in @entity11 have left thousands of people with no choice but to get water straight from @entity65			2
" reporter @entity66 , who was in @entity67 , said " the crack of heavy gunfire ripped through the town " in the afternoon , sending thousands of residents fleeing down the road to @entity11			2
" the road east to @entity11 was filled by people carrying bedding , cooking pots and whatever belongings they had to hand , " @entity66 said			2
" one boy walked past with his six goats			0
motorcycles sped past , three people squeezed onto the small seat , and minibuses were bursting with those fleeing renewed violence			0
the sound of mortar rounds exploding mixed with the rumble of thunder , rolling in from the north			0
" these refugees from @entity3 will suffer a difficult night , he said , " forced to sleep amongst the sharp , volcanic rock that defines the landscape on the edge of @entity65			2
seeking refuge in the @entity97 camp , already filled with 50,000 people			0
there is little to eat , and no shelter			0
" the situation of who is fighting and who is in control is unclear , he said			0
sake is strategic because it is a gateway to @entity108 , the capital of @entity109			0
" a motorcycle raced through the crowd saying that @entity10 had retreated from the town and were held up at a small stream crossing just outside of the city , " @entity66 said			1
" as the thousands of fleeing civilians walked east towards a camp for the internally displaced , a truck filled with rebels raced from @entity11 towards @entity3			1
minutes later , they were followed by a column of a dozen rebels , running on foot , their pick - up truck having broken down further up the road			0
@entity126 rattled around their necks as they carried @entity131 machine guns and @entity133 rifles , and some carried rocket - propelled grenades			0
" @entity10 political leader @entity135 was summoned to @entity136 by @entity13 president @entity137 , who is hosting a conference of regional leaders saturday aimed at ending the crisis in the @entity6 , according to an @entity10 source close to @entity135			1
@entity6 president @entity142 and president @entity143 of @entity21 were also in @entity136 for the @entity144 , which is set to start there saturday			1

@entity164 , the country 's capital , lies nearly 1,000 miles west of @entity11 , the capital of @entity171			1
the eastern part of the @entity6 , which includes @entity11 , has been embroiled in violence since 1994 , when @entity175 forces crossed the border from @entity21 fearing reprisals following the genocide in that country			2
the @entity10 group was named for the peace deal of march 23 , 2009 , which they accuse the government of violating			2
the soldiers , mostly @entity185 , became part of the national army through that accord			0
however , they broke away from the @entity6 army in april , complaining they were n't being promoted as promised , and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions			0
tens of thousands of @entity6 , already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region , have fled camps around the edges of @entity11 , according to @entity199 and the medical charity @entity200			2
