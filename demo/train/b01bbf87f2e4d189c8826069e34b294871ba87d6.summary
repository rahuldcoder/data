@entity1 's administration got outside legal help on thursday as a special state legislative committee decided to issue 20 subpoenas to launch its formal investigation of a scandal over alleged political retribution by top aides to the @entity10 governor			1
the subpoenas for 17 individuals and three organizations seek documents for now , said @entity16 assemblyman @entity15 , chairman of the panel			1
he refused to identify any recipients , saying they should learn of their subpoenas through being served instead of the news media			0
but @entity21 has obtained some of the names of those subpoenaed , including top current and former @entity1 administration officials			1
according to a source familiar with the subpoenas , among those served are : @entity29 , @entity1 's chief of staff , @entity30 , a close adviser , @entity32 , former deputy chief of staff , @entity34 , two - time @entity1 campaign manager , @entity36 , @entity1 's chief counsel , @entity38 , incoming chief of staff , @entity40 , @entity1 's chief spokesman , @entity42 , @entity43 , top @entity10 official at @entity46 and @entity1 appointee , @entity47 , @entity46 executive director , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
the committee is also looking at entities that had to do with the governor 's re-election , the source said			0
@entity1 fired @entity32 and asked @entity34 to leave his political operation after last week 's release of explosive e-mails on the scandal			1
one name not on the list so far is @entity1 , as @entity15 said there was " no intention " to subpoena the @entity68 governor at this time because no documents made public so far showed a " direct link " to him			1
@entity1 's office announced earlier his administration retained an outside law firm to help deal with the scandal involving traffic gridlock around the @entity75 in @entity76 last september			1
e-mails made public last week suggested the lane closures that caused four days of jammed roads were orchestrated by top @entity1 aides to punish the @entity16 mayor of @entity76 for not endorsing the governor 's re-election			1
also thursday , the @entity84 announced its own investigation in coordination with @entity15 's panel , widening the political response to the controversial closing of access lanes to the nation 's busiest bridge			1
@entity94 attorney @entity93 is also looking into the bridge matter , bringing the total number of investigations to four , including an internal review by @entity1 's office			1
@entity1 has promised cooperation with " appropriate " investigations of the matter , which could harm the presidential ambitions of the early front - runner for the @entity68 nomination in 2016			2
can @entity1 change the subject ? he appeared to refer to the scandal when he told a thursday morning event involving @entity110 recovery efforts that " no one , i can assure you , ever told me or anyone on my team that it was going to be easy			1
" " whatever test they put in front of me , i will meet those tests , " @entity1 said to applause			2
separately , a source close to @entity1 said the governor believes the investigations into the scandal will be a long process			1
@entity1 does not intend to address the controversy in his inaugural address after he gets sworn in for a second term next week , the source told @entity21 's @entity131 on condition of not being identified			1
documents made public last week suggested that top staffers in @entity1 's administration orchestrated the traffic logjam in @entity76 as payback for the failure of the town 's @entity16 mayor to endorse the governor for re-election			1
those served will have two weeks to supply the requested documents , @entity15 said , adding he expected his committee to meet again in mid-february to consider what it had received and possible next steps			0
ad firm head : we were asked about using @entity1 in @entity152 campaign @entity1 said last week he knew nothing about any decision by aides to close highway lanes as political punishment , but @entity15 and other @entity16 label such a scenario as implausible			2
the traffic gridlock occurred two months before @entity1 was re-elected to a second term			2
in a document made public thursday by @entity16 sen. @entity163 , chairman of the @entity164 , the @entity46 and @entity10 said a traffic study initially cited as the reason for the lane closures was an " aberrational " event conducted outside normal protocol			0
the authority 's response to questions from @entity163 also said @entity1 's top appointee to the @entity46 leadership , @entity173 , ordered the lane closures and suggested that he failed to heed warnings about their impact			1
in addition , @entity173 ordered a @entity46 manager " not to communicate information about the lane reduction " to officials in @entity76 and indicated " he would control the communication about the toll lane closures , " according to the response			0
@entity173 resigned from the @entity46 late last year as the controversy unfolded			0
despite polls showing @entity1 as the early favorite for the @entity68 presidential nomination two years from now , the bridge crisis has grabbed national attention and forced the normally combative governor to adopt a more conciliatory posture			2
" gov. @entity1 made clear last week that he will conduct an internal review to uncover the facts surrounding the lane closures in @entity76 , " his office said thursday			1
" his administration is fully cooperating with the @entity94 attorney inquiry and other appropriate inquiries and requests for information			0
" the @entity1 administration has retained @entity205 as outside counsel in a move the administration hopes " will bring an outside , third party perspective to the situation			2
" opinion : is @entity1 presidential ? @entity214 , a former assistant @entity94 attorney for the @entity215 , will head the legal team			2
@entity214 has experience in organized crime cases and led the federal racketeering lawsuit that forced the @entity220 to hold democratic elections and to undergo court supervision			0
@entity214 also is a former deputy mayor of @entity223			0
on the other side , the @entity16 - led @entity225 panel investigating the scandal will be assisted by attorney @entity228 , a key figure in the federal prosecution of former @entity232 gov. @entity231			0
on tuesday , @entity1 addressed the scandal briefly in his state of the state address , saying " mistakes were clearly made			2
" he also tried to shift the focus to policy initiatives , repeatedly imploring @entity16 to work with him			0
the allegation of political payback first made by @entity16 was subsequently magnified by e-mails that state legislators released last week			0
@entity32 's name appeared in e-mails with @entity173 , including one in which she wrote : " time for some traffic problems in @entity76			0
" other exchanges suggested that @entity34 was aware of the maneuvering that led to traffic gridlock			0
while the e-mails do not link @entity42 , the governor 's spokesman , to the traffic jam scandal or even suggest it , they indicate that he had dinner with @entity173 two days before the transportation official resigned			0
@entity173 thanked @entity42 for his " sound advice , " and the two men later e-mailed back and forth about how to announce his departure from the @entity46			0
federal officials also are looking at @entity10 's use of $ 25 million in @entity110 relief funds for a marketing campaign promoting the @entity265 's recovery that featured @entity1 and his family			2
in a statement monday , @entity1 's office said the " @entity281 " campaign was part of an " action plan " approved by the @entity273 administration and developed with the goal of showing that the @entity275 was open for business several months after the storm that devastated parts of the mid-atlantic in october 2012			1
the campaign took place the same year that @entity1 was running for re-election			0
on tuesday , the federal @entity285 described the investigation as a routine audit " and not an investigation of the procurement process			0
" opinion : sure , @entity1 's team did wrong , but @entity10 dems are just as bad			1
