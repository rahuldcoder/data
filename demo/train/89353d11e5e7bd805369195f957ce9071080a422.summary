-- the results of the midterm election confirm @entity4 ' widespread discontent with @entity6 gridlock on a range of issues			1
in the last few months , millions of people contacted the @entity10 , @entity11 and federal agencies to demand action on one of those issues -- protecting a free and open @entity16			1
their message was overwhelmingly clear : @entity4 do n't want fast and slow lanes online			1
they want the government to preserve the internet as a place where everybody -- startups , small businesses , nonprofits , activists , and independent artists -- has an equal chance of reaching people			0
yet it appears their voices have fallen on deaf ears			0
the @entity35 , tasked with creating new rules to protect the @entity16 , appears to be favoring a proposal that will allow fast lanes after all			1
as the @entity39 reports , the proposal would permit internet service providers ( @entity41 ) like @entity42 and @entity43 to charge internet applications , content or services access fees for faster service , as long as those fees are " just and reasonable			0
" the proposal is bad policy and rests on shaky legal foundations			1
if some companies can pay so that their content loads faster and reaches people easier , then small businesses and startups wo n't have a chance to compete			0
innovation as we know it will suffer			0
in fact , the proposal harms anyone who ca n't pay to be in the fast lane , making it harder for everyday people to create , connect and organize online			1
it 's no wonder that 3.7 million @entity4 , more than 70 members of @entity11 , and president @entity69 have come out against fast lanes			1
so far , the @entity35 is not listening			2
but it 's not too late			0
the @entity35 should take this week 's midterm results as a wake - up call to listen to the public			1
it should ban access fees and stop the creation of fast lanes in a way that will be upheld in court			1
net neutrality explained in order to ban access fees , the @entity35 must reclassify the @entity41 that connect us to the internet as common carriers under @entity84 of the @entity85			2
that 's the only way to ban these fees , and that 's what the agency should do			0
but instead , it seems to be leaning toward a confusing " hybrid " proposal that creates two legal categories for the service offered by @entity41 â € ” a " wholesale " service that allows companies like @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 to reach us , and a " retail " service that connects us to the @entity16			1
the @entity35 wants to classify only the wholesale side under @entity105 under this " hybrid " proposal , the @entity35 would decide case - by - case whether specific access fees are just , reasonable and non-discriminatory			1
this approach provides little certainty to entrepreneurs and investors , creates high regulatory costs , and tilts the playing field against those who do n't have the resources , time and money to engage in long and costly proceedings at the @entity35			2
worst of all , it still allows access fees and fast lanes			1
any access fees , no matter how " reasonable , " will crush innovation in @entity4			2
if @entity42 offered a fast lane to @entity99 , the @entity35 could potentially force it to make a similar offer to @entity128 and @entity129			1
but if a video startup could n't pay the fee , then it would never have the chance to compete in the first place			0
think of what we 'd lose			0
innovators with little or no outside funding have produced some of the most important sites -- such as @entity97 , @entity140 , @entity98 , and @entity141 -- and economic research suggests that such innovators will continue to fuel our nation 's economic growth			0
even companies that remain small create jobs and provide value to customers			0
but there 's more that we 'd lose			0
large corporations that pay to be in the fast lane will have higher costs , so we the customers will be forced to pay higher prices for their products and services			2
small businesses that rely on the @entity16 to reach their customers will be shut out of the market			2
worse , all noncommercial actors will be in the slow lane -- educators , artists , activists , nonprofits , underserved communities , and the list goes on			1
this will harm democratic discourse as we know it			0
as if this was n't bad enough , the @entity35 's proposal is also likely to fail in court			1
the proposal appears to prevent @entity41 from blocking or discriminating against sites , but it relies on a new , untested legal foundation that does not actually allow the @entity35 to adopt such rules			1
and while this legal foundation empowers the agency to police access fees , it does not grant it the authority to ban them			0
so even if the @entity35 wanted to improve its rules and ban access fees , any attempt to do so under its proposed " hybrid " approach would likely be struck down in court			2
from the @entity35 's perspective , the proposal might seem like a compromise			1
it improves the @entity35 's ability to police access fees , but does not actually ban them			2
it involves @entity84 , but does not reclassify @entity41			0
but we are not getting the benefit of the bargain			0
the proposed rules fail to protect the @entity16 , pose high social costs , and will most likely be struck down in court			2
and as @entity41 have made abundantly clear , they oppose " hybrid " proposals just as strongly as reclassification and will fight them tooth and nail			0
fortunately , there is a better " compromise " on the table			0
the @entity35 should reclassify internet service under @entity84 and then lift ( or in legal terms , " forebear from " ) all regulations that are not needed to protect consumers			1
this route would allow the @entity35 to pursue a light regulatory touch that protects @entity41 ' incentives to invest while adopting bright - line rules that ban blocking , discrimination , and access fees			2
the @entity35 is at a fork in the road			0
it could turn its back on sound policy and public opinion and pursue fast lanes , or it could adopt meaningful rules that protect the @entity4 people and will be upheld in court			1
the correct path is clear .			0

@entity236 : @entity4 want a free and open @entity16 , not a fast and slow lane
@entity239 : yet , the @entity35 appears to be favoring a proposal that will allow fast lanes
she says that 's bad policy and rests on shaky legal foundations ; @entity35 must look to better policy
@entity239 : two lanes will hurt innovation , and consumers will have to pay more money
