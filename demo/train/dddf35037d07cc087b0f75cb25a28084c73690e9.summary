-- call it @entity3 's ivory tower			1
the 35 - story white skyscraper stands tall overlooking the mangroves of this oil rich emirate which is the capital of the @entity9			2
it was the venue for what was arguably the most important corporate press conference this year in the @entity9			0
the subject at hand was the construction firm @entity15			1
at the front of the room , board members who represent the " who 's who " of @entity3 trading families : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			2
the major backer of @entity15 is the state run investment group @entity27 , which is one of the many funds controlled by @entity30 , deputy prime minister , the minister of presidential affairs , and the owner of , amongst other trophy assets , @entity34			1
until a month ago , this company was not on anybody 's global radar , even though the @entity39 - based group is well known around these parts			1
it has built the new global landmarks like the @entity43 , the world 's tallest tower , and the world 's most expensive hotel to be constructed , the @entity48			2
it is also busy putting up the @entity50 , part of a $ 25 billion cultural district in the city			0
interest inside and outside the country has been swirling around @entity15 and @entity39 's stock exchange for the past month , especially after the market achieved an upgrade to @entity59 's emerging market index in june			1
but with a global upgrade comes international scrutiny for a company and stock market that many fund managers say are falling short on both transparency and corporate governance			1
the press event was somewhat surreal			0
players representing billions of dollars of investment trying to clear up how a former ceo @entity70 accumulated 28 % of the stock without either the company or the @entity73 raising any red flags			1
an @entity76 reporter i know was told before the press conference that we could all take our tv cameras in , but not have any audio			0
that idea was quickly dropped			0
six board members were present , but @entity15 chairman @entity84 did all the talking during this hour long affair			1
what emerged was a man out to clear the air			0
he said @entity15 has not seen one project cancellation and that @entity15 will in future do what it does best and that is construction -- and not venture into oil and gas as the previous leadership had planned			1
the chairman told me , during a chat we had after the conference , that the former ceo used a handful of company vehicles to become the biggest shareholder to date			1
" this guy decided to gather all the shares , because they are linked to mr. @entity109 , " @entity84 said			0
" this is what i understood			0
but to be frank with you to speak about the details , i do n't know			0
" that is not a big confidence builder for an @entity59 listed company			0
we still do n't know , despite it being probed , where @entity70 got the money to buy so much stock			2
but when i asked @entity84 about whether he has unearthed any impropriety , he told me : " there is nothing			0
we are only putting the system right now , but there is an auditor there , compliance system , everything there , but our job is to improve it			2
" improving transparency to global standards will be a challenge , but @entity138 's order book seems to be healthy according to an analyst report put out today			1
there is a backlog of some $ 16 billion according to @entity142 and the construction group has been anointed by @entity3 to build $ 40 billion of low income housing in @entity145 to support the new government there			2
that as they say is good business by any global standard			0
