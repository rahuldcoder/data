editor 's note : @entity2 , author of " you think that 's bad , " honors the kind of mothers who never , ever hold back , especially when it comes to love , yelling and dandelion sandwiches			1
( @entity11 ) -- my mother was born @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , a town whose name roughly translates as " strangle the rooster , " and if you were to meet my mother , you 'd think : " of course that 's where she 's from			1
" an observer could tell from a low - flying aircraft that my mother comes from what used to be called hearty peasant stock , and when it comes to both the social niceties and interacting with her family , @entity14 has always had the touch of a blacksmith			1
when agitated , she 's something to behold , and she 's almost always agitated			1
she has a voice that could knock squirrels from trees			2
i remember a boy who lived two streets over remarking on the bus to school that he 'd heard me being disciplined the day before			2
she 's half - deaf , or by now more than half - deaf , thanks to a punctured eardrum from childhood , which means that even when she 's trying to be discreet -- say , when sitting in a theater and needing help with a movie 's plot -- those all around her , in a wide , wide circle , have the uncanny impression that @entity14 is talking directly to them			1
a few years ago , at her 80th birthday , i found myself wondering where to begin , when celebrating her			2
there are so many lessons that i realize i 've learned from @entity14 's examples -- positive and negative -- over the years : the importance of calm			1
the advantages of beating your children with a wooden spoon as opposed to a metal one			1
and here 's a good rule of thumb , for those of you who might wonder what it 's like to grow up with a mother who a ) was raised in a particularly poverty - stricken region of @entity16 and b ) lived through the @entity76 : you 're going to learn some lessons about frugality from a woman who eats dandelion sandwiches			1
@entity11 : why every happy person needs a @entity83 mom without @entity14 , i also probably would n't be a writer			1
one characteristic of writers is a playfulness with words -- and boy , is being around @entity14 a crash course in that			1
she has , over the years , told her children to stay away from strange animals in the woods , because those animals could bite you and give you rabbis			2
she 's told us that someone she knew was well - off because he had an ingrown swimming pool			2
she 's told us , when unable to decide about something , that she did n't care ; that as far as she was concerned , it was eight of one or a half dozen of another			2
she 's told us that her brother @entity105 was so generous he 'd give you the skin off his back			2
she told a friend of mine that one of my favorite monster movies when i was a kid was " @entity114 vs. @entity115			2
" and how 's this for an unexpectedly highbrow contribution that my mother made to my life : maybe more than anyone i know , she 's demonstrated just how mysterious a thing identity really is			1
who are we , really ? can we ever really know ? my mother has had a hilariously hard time keeping names and faces straight , even within her own nuclear family			1
over the years , she 's called me @entity105 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and hey you			2
but it was n't that it was she was distracted ; it was that she was so excited about the things that other people take for granted			2
as in : " oh , my @entity137 , @entity105 , come look : a @entity138 ! " @entity11 : @entity140 's rules for life so you can imagine how surprised i was the first time i came home from college and found @entity14 sitting at the kitchen table with an unsettling smile on her face			1
my mother ... silent ? at first , she refused to explain why			1
then she said , " go look at your room			2
i looked at my room			2
the floor was covered with a bright purple wall - to - wall shag rug			2
the walls were a deep lavender			0
the furniture had been stained a dark purple			0
i came back downstairs , and she was still smiling			0
" why is my room all purple ? " i asked			0
" @entity163 , " she answered			0
" why is my room all purple ? " i asked again			0
" you like the @entity165 , " she explained , as though i 'd forgotten			0
" i like to watch them play , " i said			0
" i do n't want to live inside their color			0
" this seems to me a quintessential @entity14 story , full of both over-the - top lunacy and love			1
i always find it moving how tireless she is in all her efforts to please			0
she hunted up , somewhere , a dark - purple stain and lugged all of my furniture downstairs and outside and stained it all and then lugged it all the way back upstairs			0
probably my poor father was recruited , as well			0
it took her hours , if not days , to make my room that ugly			0
@entity11 : 12 things @entity184 wishes she could tell her mom there are advantages , when it comes to engaging the world , to having a mother with the touch of a blacksmith			1
my father , now stricken with short - term memory loss , was considered by most of his friends and family to be one of the more anxious people they ever encountered			0
@entity14 worked relentlessly for decades to build bridges between her erratic kids -- who sometimes did things that seemed to suggest that we had the collective brains of a squirrel -- and her husband , who clearly preferred that we stay packed in cotton in a box until we were 21			1
she worked night and day to carve out a space in which we could go out into the world and screw up			0
and naturally , being who we were , we obliged her			0
there is no one else from whom i could have learned so much about the advantages of being emotionally forthright and about the pleasures of making that emotional forthrightness vivid			1
you always know where @entity14 stands on things , whether it 's the bigheartedness of her family ( a frequent subject that brings her to tears when she considers how little it 's appreciated by the rest of the world ) or the horrors of waste ( that 's a sin , she 'll say if anyone leaves anything that resembles food on their plate			1
when @entity14 cleans a bone , it looks as if army ants have been all over it			1
) once , when i was when i was 14 or so and we were arguing about something , i teased her that she did n't love me , and she started whacking me on the arm and back as hard as she could , one whack for each syllable , while she yelled , " do n't you tell me that i do n't love you ! " she was going to love me no matter what , even if she was going to have to beat me to death to prove it			0
there 's no one who could have better demonstrated the importance of unconditional love			1
@entity11 : motherhood : what endless love feels like @entity14 was my first real supporter , mentor and teacher			1
who would have guessed it ? not me , at least not for the longest time			0
i should have , though			0
what could be more compelling , after all , than a @entity260 ? @entity14 is a continual reminder not to do things halfway , to give oneself over to the world with a passionate intensity			1
i knew they loved each other , but my parents fought so much when i was a kid that when no one was yelling in the house i found myself wondering if someone had died			0
and yet my brother and i have been unbelievably lucky to have been in the track of her storm			0
wherever she 's passed , sure , there are branches down and leaves all over the place , but the clouds look washed and beautiful , and the sky is beginning to clear			0
and the storm itself , we soon realize , has been mesmerizing , has been galvanizing and has been just what was necessary to shake us into feeling what anyone who 's spent any time around @entity14 has always felt : as though they 've really lived through something			1

he credits her with his becoming a writer because she *fostered* his creativity
@entity14 also taught him the advantages of being emotionally forthright
