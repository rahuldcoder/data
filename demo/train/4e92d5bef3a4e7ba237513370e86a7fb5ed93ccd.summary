-- one goal in eight matches for new club @entity3 , and dumped by the @entity5 national team			1
perhaps the man known as " @entity8 " @entity6 is n't feeling quite so super at present			2
offloaded by @entity5 giants @entity10 prior to the start of the season , the 24 - year - old is already onto the fourth high - profile club of his fledgling career			1
and until the striker , painted as a maverick and a trouble maker in the press , proves he can ' " carry " a club , his enormous potential may go unfulfilled , according to @entity10 director @entity21			1
" @entity25 has not made the transition yet from being just a fantastic athlete to a great player , " @entity21 told @entity0 of one of the most talked about players in world football			1
" the expectation was probably bigger ( at @entity10 ) , and i think also his expectations , and he has not reached the status yet where he can carry the club			1
" until he will do that he wo n't be able to fulfill his promises			0
" @entity6 has struggled to adapt to life back in the @entity35 , scoring just one goal in eight matches for @entity3 since his $ 25 million move in august			1
even his new manager @entity39 admitted signing the former @entity40 forward was a " calculated risk " given his checkered past , saying the player himself knows this is probably his last chance			0
not helping him is the shadow of the man he replaced on @entity47 -- @entity48 , now at @entity50 club @entity49			0
the @entity51 achieved cult status at the club , scoring 82 goals in 133 appearances , and 31 times last season as the @entity57 came agonizingly close to a first @entity35 title since 1990			2
and while there are similarities in the way the pair have courted controversy in the past , @entity6 is yet to offered any hint of the potency that punctuated @entity48 's stay at the club			2
he is yet to get off the mark in the @entity35 and whether he will play alongside @entity72 on sunday against @entity73 , the @entity69 striker having returned to fitness , remains to be seen			0
tales of @entity6 's private life dominated his last stint in @entity69 and @entity10 president @entity77 , the former @entity5 prime minister , this week said the striker was signed against his advice , calling him a " bad apple			1
" but that is at odds with @entity21 's assessment -- that @entity6 is far more professional than he is portrayed -- though he does acknowledge the player is energized by conflict			1
" he is much , much better than he is portrayed and his lifestyle was much better than portrayed in @entity69 , " @entity21 added			2
" he is a fantastic kid , he is humble , and recognizes a lot of values that football has given to him , and life in general			0
" i think he loves the fight			0
he loves to fight with something or somebody -- on the pitch , in life			0
he 's always trying to take the stance .			0

@entity10 director @entity21 tells @entity0 the time was right for @entity6 to leave
@entity21 says the controversial striker is not yet at the stage where he can " carry the club "
@entity6 left @entity10 for @entity3 in august but has had a modest start to life at @entity106
the 24 - year - old has just one goals in eight matches and was recently *benched*
