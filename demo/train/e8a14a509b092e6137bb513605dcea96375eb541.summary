last week , a member of @entity2 , senate majority leader @entity0 , actually defended the way that @entity2 does its business			1
give him credit for originality			0
rather than the usual refrain of blasting @entity8 as a dysfunctional and corrupt city , @entity0 disagreed with president @entity10 and said : " i have been a fan of earmarks since i got here the first day			1
i disagree -- underline , underscored , big exclamation mark -- with @entity10			1
" he opposes the ban on earmarks that @entity2 put into place three years ago following the @entity18 victories in the 2010 midterm elections			1
earmarks , historically referred to as a form of " pork - barrel spending " , are measures that @entity25 and @entity26 members add to bills to benefit people in their own districts			1
in response to @entity0 's comments , there was the predictable backlash of criticism			1
sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , warned that " the @entity38 public think it 's a sick way to run a business , to have to bribe somebody to get something done and politicians use it to look good at home			1
" in the @entity46 , @entity35 pushed back against calls to bring back a little pork by writing , " restoring earmarks in today 's @entity2 would be like opening a bar tab for a bunch of recovering alcoholics			1
" but @entity0 has a point , and many @entity18 who spent much of their careers mastering the art of congressional spending agree with him -- even though many are scared to say so in public			1
indeed , even with the recent " ban " , according to the conservative @entity61 , the 2014 budget included almost $ 2.7 billion in spending for projects requested by individual legislators ( much of which went to defense and national security projects )			0
legislators have found new ways ( called lettermarking or phonemarking ) to obtain these kinds of appropriations , though in smaller scale than before			0
congressional earmarks and pork barrel spending have a long history in the @entity38			1
they have served important purposes that are too often overlooked			0
most important , this kind of congressional spending has been vital to successful negotiation on @entity82			0
presidents and party leaders have traditionally depended on their influence to insert measures in congressional spending bills to persuade legislators to join them in voting for key legislation that is important to the national interest			1
often , earmarked spending has been the most important tool in the effort to persuade legislators to vote against their interests or their traditional position			0
during the battle over the @entity98 , president @entity96 needed as many votes as possible to overcome the @entity101 filibuster against the bill in the @entity26			1
one of the ways in which @entity96 won over a key vote , that of @entity106 democrat @entity105 , was to let him know that the administration would throw its support behind a @entity109 that the senator 's constituents desperately wanted			0
in exchange @entity105 , one of the many @entity112 who had traditionally refused to vote to end any filibuster , agreed to vote for cloture if his support was needed in the end			0
without a little pork , @entity96 would have been unable to obtain his support			2
we can even see how earmarked spending has proved effective at the state and local level			2
in @entity124 , the state famously littered university campuses in as many legislative districts as possible so that the state system would have broad and durable support			0
the outcome was ongoing , bipartisan support for investment in higher education that has been vital to the residents of @entity124			0
earmarked spending also fits into our respect for decentralized and localized decision - making			0
when legislators lobby for spending within their district , they are usually responding to the pressures and demands that emanate from the local level			2
to be sure there are many examples of outrageous earmarks that do n't have much justification or value			2
political speeches and newspaper stories are filled with accounts of this kind of useless pork			1
however , for every " bridge to nowhere " there are congressional earmarks that fund university research and public works programs that play a vital role for @entity38			2
@entity160 writes in @entity161 that the @entity163 congressional delegation obtained about $ 2 million in earmarked funding that was used to provide more services for members of the @entity168 who returned from @entity169 and @entity170			2
" earmarks , " she writes , " have funded hundreds of job training programs , paved roads that reduced traffic , supported the police officers protecting our streets , underwritten research on diseases , revitalized blighted neighborhoods , developed technologies to improve national defense , built libraries and schools and given children opportunities to learn			2
" earmarked spending is a good way to build broad and durable party support for important public policies			0
very often , crafting programs that provide pork to legislators has been an effective way to broaden support for a policy			2
during the @entity196 , @entity195 was keen to provide money to the districts of key @entity200 legislators so that they would become politically invested in his public works program			0
that program offered key relief to @entity38 workers during the height of the @entity206			0
the complex patchwork of military defense contracting throughout the @entity209 , often a result of legislative efforts to get money to valuable districts , was essential for @entity18 in building support for a muscular national security policy against the @entity216			0
so earmarks have their function and @entity0 has a point			1
members of both parties understand that this has been key			2
the legislative process is not pretty , but there have been many moments when @entity2 has accomplished big things -- and earmarked spending has been critical to success			1
it might be time to push back a little on our anti-washington sentiment and look more carefully at the value of some of the seemingly uglier sides of our political process			0
indeed , restoring the pork barrel might help move @entity2 beyond its current dysfunctional state			1
earmarks would be the place to start .			0

sen. @entity0 spoke out in favor of earmarks , disagreeing with president @entity10
@entity246 says @entity0 is right ; there are benefits from dispensing political pork
he says presidents can gain leverage with @entity2 if they permit earmarks
@entity246 : earmarks enable members of @entity2 to respond to local needs
