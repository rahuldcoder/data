lax oversight at the @entity1 allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups , resulting in lengthy delays in the processing of their applications for federal tax - exempt status , according to a report by the agency 's inspector general released tuesday			1
the report found that for more than 18 months beginning in early 2010 the @entity1 developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities , which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax - exempt status			1
" the @entity1 used inappropriate criteria that identified for review @entity18 and other organizations applying for tax - exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention , " according to the report			1
president @entity28 called the report findings " intolerable and inexcusable			1
" " the federal government must conduct itself in a way that 's worthy of the public 's trust , and that 's especially true for the @entity1			2
the @entity1 must apply the law in a fair and impartial way , and its employees must act with utmost integrity			1
this report shows that some of its employees failed that test , " the president said in a statement released late tuesday			2
opinion : the real risk of the @entity1 scandal @entity28 said he has directed @entity47 secretary of treasury @entity48 " to hold those responsible for these failures accountable			1
" @entity1 officials , according to the report , did not consult anyone beyond the agency about the development of the additional screening criteria			1
they believed that the criteria they came up with was a screening shortcut meant to help with the influx of applications , the report said			1
the agency 's top watchdog found that the criteria used to flag potential political applications resulted in substantial delays and the request of unnecessary information from the groups			1
among the criteria used by @entity1 officials to flag applications was a " @entity77 " list , or a bolo , which was discontinued in 2012 , according to the report			1
the criteria on the @entity76 included : -- whether " @entity18 , " " @entity80 " or " @entity81 " was referenced in the case file			0
-- whether the issues outlined in the application included government spending , government debt or taxes			0
-- whether there was advocating or lobbying to " make @entity47 a better place to live			0
" -- whether a statement in the case file criticized how the country is being run			0
-- whether it advocated education about the @entity95 and the @entity96			0
the investigation by the @entity98 was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the @entity1 was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications			1
@entity28 struggles with rocky start to second term " whether the inappropriate criterion was shorthand for all potential political cases or not , developing and using criteria that focuses on organization names and policy positions instead of the activities permitted under the treasury regulations does not promote public confidence that tax - exempt laws are being adhered to impartially , " the report said			1
the @entity1 welcomed the @entity117 inspector general 's report , saying that it agreed that aspects of its original approach in handling the influx of tax - exempt applications was inappropriate			1
" the @entity1 is required by law to determine if organizations are engaging in a legally permissible level of political activity			2
centralizing these cases was necessary to achieve consistent treatment , " it said in a statement			0
the developments came hours after @entity47 attorney general @entity130 announced the @entity131 had launched a criminal investigation into whether the @entity1 politically targeted some conservative groups			1
" the @entity135 is coordinating with the @entity131 to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters related to the @entity1 , " @entity130 said at a briefing			2
in a written response included in the report , the @entity1 commissioner of the @entity140 said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents , but rather inefficient management			1
@entity1 in the spotlight : what 's a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) ? " we believe the front - line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political and partisan viewpoint , " the commissioner wrote			1
the report found that all of the applications that were sent to the @entity163 " experienced substantial delays in processing			2
" " although the processing of some applications with potential significant political campaign intervention was started soon after receipt , no work was completed on the majority of these applications for 13 months , " it said			0
the report 's findings indicate that of the 298 cases reviewed by the @entity1 inspector general as potential political cases not eligible for tax exempt status : 72 contained the name " tea party , " 11 contained " 9/12 " and 13 contained the word " patriots , " according to the report			1
there were 202 cases that did not contain any such reference			0
of those applications still open for review , 160 cases were open from 206 days to more than three years -- through two election cycles			0
among the recommendations made by the @entity117 inspector general : the @entity1 better document reasons why applications are chosen for review , develop a process to track requests for assistance , develop and provide training to employees before each election cycle and immediately resolve outstanding cases			1
the report also called on the @entity203 to develop guidelines to explain social welfare activity -- the primary factor in obtaining tax - exempt status			0
" although the @entity1 has taken some action , it will need to do more so that the public has reasonable assurance that applications are processed without unreasonable delay in a fair and impartial manner in the future , " the report said			1
@entity216 , director of tax - exempt organizations for the @entity1 , acknowledged friday that the @entity1 had targeted some groups for further review because they had those words in their names			1
she said the activity took place at the @entity1 office in @entity225 , which handles applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status			2
opinion : @entity1 abuses power in targeting tea party but documents suggest at least three other @entity1 offices did the same			2
letters provided to @entity235 show @entity1 officials in @entity237 and @entity238 contacted conservative groups to demand more information before approving the groups ' requests for tax - exempt status			2
the @entity244 , a legal group representing numerous conservative organizations , provided @entity235 with four such letters : one each from @entity1 offices in @entity237 ; @entity225 ; @entity250 , @entity238 , and @entity251 , @entity238			2
the @entity1 did not respond to @entity235 's request for comment regarding the letters			0
@entity256 spokesman @entity255 told reporters tuesday that he 's " confident " no one at the @entity256 was involved in the practice			0
asked about complaints by some @entity262 lawmakers for the past couple of years that conservative groups were being unfairly targeted , @entity255 said he is " sure some people knew about the stories			0
but we were not aware of any activity or any review by the inspector general			0
" some @entity262 criticized the president for not speaking out on the issue immediately			0
he said he learned about it through news reports friday			0
the @entity262 - led @entity275 , which oversees the @entity1 , announced it will hold a hearing friday			0
slated to testify are @entity277 , the acting @entity1 commissioner ; and the @entity117 inspector general investigating the complaints , @entity281			0
sen. @entity282 , @entity283 , said the @entity284 -- which he chairs -- now needs to expand an investigation already under way			0
that one has focused on the @entity1 's " failure to enforce the law requiring that tax - exempt 501 ( c ) 4s be engaged exclusively in social welfare activities , not partisan politics , " @entity282 said in a statement			0
the @entity1 ' announcement about targeting of some conservative groups raises questions over its impartiality in doing so , he added			2
will scandal impact 2014 elections ?			0
