-- @entity2 captain @entity1 is warning his side against complacency as they go into sunday 's @entity7 final against @entity8 as odds - on favorites to lift the @entity12 trophy			1
while hosts @entity14 have enjoyed a relatively smooth and unbeaten passage to the finale of the global showpiece at @entity18 , @entity8 have been beaten twice and failed to hit their top form			2
but @entity1 , who was left in tears as the @entity2 stumbled to a 20 - 18 quarterfinal defeat to the @entity22 in the 2007 @entity7 , said saturday that negative media coverage had given @entity8 extra motivation to spring another upset			1
" i 've got no doubt the @entity22 are going to play their best game and you blokes have loaded the gun for them , " he told gathered reporters at the official press conference			0
" they 've got players who 've been around for a long time and they understand what it takes to win @entity40 matches			0
" and as to @entity8 's indifferent form , including a 37 - 17 loss to his team and a dismal defeat against @entity45 in the pool stages , @entity1 believes it counts for nothing			1
" in a final it 's not about who ' deserves ' what , " said @entity1			2
" it 's about who goes and plays the best rugby on that stage , in this game , that 's what we 've got to do			0
" the @entity2 , the traditional powerhouses of international rugby , are searching for only a second @entity7 triumph , their only title coming in the inaugural tournament in 1987 when they beat @entity8 in the final in @entity65			1
@entity14 to end 24 years of hurt ? @entity1 's @entity22 counterpart and rival flanker @entity67 said his team were determined to defy the odds after scraping into the final with a 9 - 8 victory over 14 - man @entity71 last weekend			1
" no matter whatever the sport , all kids dream of being world champions			1
it ca n't get better than being the world champions and to achieve those dream , " he said			1
" we showed great strength to get here			0
there 's one match left and we need to prove ourselves			0
" @entity8 's defense coach , @entity84 @entity83 , is confident they can repeat their previous successes against the @entity2 and claims to have found chinks in their armor			1
" we feel there are certain areas of their defense we can exploit , " he told the official @entity7 website			0
" there are things that we found out and we are quite capable of exploiting those weaknesses			0
" but despite @entity12 ' bold talk , it would be almost unthinkable for the @entity2 to fail to deliver with a whole nation holding its collective breath			2
@entity7 is the national sport in @entity14 and after the tragic events of earlier this year when @entity104 was hit by an earthquake and the recent oil spill in the @entity107 , many have looked upon the @entity7 to lift collective spirits			2
@entity14 prime minister @entity110 had no doubt when asked about the result on the eve of the final			2
" i 'm thinking they 're going to beat them and beat them quite comfortably , " he said			0
with elections looming , @entity110 will be hoping his bold prediction holds come sunday night .			0
