-- when others dismissed @entity3 as a falling knife unworthy of investment , @entity1 saw something else			1
@entity1 imagined @entity3 regenerating from within , with damaged civic tissue repairing itself to foster new life and commerce			1
as president of a foundation named for a patriarch who emigrated to @entity13 130 years ago and immediately launched a business , he was in a position to test his idea			1
the secret , @entity1 figured , is harnessing the collective power of what he calls " anchor institutions " : in this case , @entity23 , @entity22 and @entity21			2
through what emerged as the @entity26 , @entity1 's @entity27 , alongside other funders , is finding ways to hitch the fortunes of these institutions to the fortunes of the surrounding neighborhoods			2
@entity35 's research partner , @entity36 from @entity37 , compiled the data that confirmed the hunch : the anchor institutions carry breathtaking heft			2
at a moment when the @entity44 of @entity3 has been declared insolvent and foundations are looking for innovation , the approach carries two critical lessons for community development			1
first , investors must build from assets , not deficits			2
many foundations like to use quality - of - life indicators to guide their philanthropy			2
i have been involved in a number of these efforts over the years , and too often , foundations find it irresistible to direct their charitable giving to whatever problem tops the charts			2
it feels like the right approach ; if dropout rates emerge as the worst problem in a neighborhood , why not tackle it ? problem is , whether the needle moves on this indicator or not , the approach is unlikely to contribute to broader neighborhood transformation			0
@entity35 's method reveals the potential of another kind of analysis , one that is based on the untapped power of existing assets			0
it turns out @entity23 , @entity81 and @entity82 employ about 30,000 people , hire 3,300 associates every year , enroll 32,000 students , control about half of @entity3 's real estate and -- perhaps most important -- spend about $ 1.7 billion every year on goods and services			1
@entity36 found that about 4.5 % of the $ 1.7 million in spending on goods and services was going to @entity3 vendors ; the rest is what @entity36 calls leakage			1
if @entity3 businesses could step up to provide quality goods and services at the right price -- this is a business play , not charity -- then even small upward ticks would represent enormous amounts of investment and , in turn , jobs			1
@entity3 organized vendor fairs to introduce local businesses to the big institutions and made sure local businesses got to see all the requests for proposals coming from the anchors			1
as a result , a local bakery , a local print shop and a local construction firm were among the firms winning $ 20 million in business from the anchor institutions			0
the contracts created jobs for area residents and enabled the small businesses to ratchet up their capacity			1
the successes point to the second critical lesson for foundations : instead of limiting themselves to traditional charitable gifts -- building a playground , offering scholarships to deserving high school students -- the approach strengthens the connections between neighborhood residents and the marketplace			0
by aligning work force training with the needs of the anchors , the @entity26 has placed 50 local residents in entry - level jobs			1
once up to full speed , @entity145 of @entity3 believes , the arrangement can place 200 residents a year into jobs			1
@entity3 is also rebuilding a strong neighborhood residential core			1
incentives to lure renters and buyers have drawn more than 1,000 residents to the neighborhood			0
while the experiments are ongoing , the results are promising			0
@entity158 , cities had to find new approaches to revive neighborhoods			0
it 's not enough to build low - cost housing , says @entity163 , founder of the @entity165 's @entity164 , and there is no massive investment coming from the federal government			2
" the cavalry is not coming , " said @entity163 , who describes local innovations from across the country in a new book , " @entity172 : how cities and @entity174 and @entity176			0
" cities can not wait for old programs to return , @entity163 says			0
they are not coming back			0
instead , cities should build from whatever assets they have at hand and make a new kind of business case for investment , from within and without			0
@entity37 ' @entity36 believes that focusing on anchor institutions forces a discipline that prevents wishful thinking			0
foundations , with their government and private - sector partners , can base expectations on the realities of supply and demand for hiring , business activity and residential growth			0
in the end , anchor institutions may present the best hope for neighborhood transformation simply because of their scale			0
when it comes to sources of employment , investment and connectivity , the scale and power of the @entity3 anchors dwarfs anything a foundation could sustain			1
even better : instead of assuming residents need a handout , the approach gives residents an opening to participate in capitalism			0
