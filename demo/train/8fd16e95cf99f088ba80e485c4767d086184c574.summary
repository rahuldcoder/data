@entity0 , a decorated @entity2 veteran convicted of murdering a 22 - year - old sheriff 's deputy in 1998 , was executed tuesday , said @entity4 , spokeswoman for the @entity6 @entity5			1
earlier in the day , the @entity6 @entity7 joined the state 's parole board in declining to stop the execution			1
the justices denied a stay of execution by a vote of 6 - 1 , with one justice not participating			1
@entity0 was scheduled to die of lethal injection at 7 p.m. et tuesday at the @entity17 in @entity18			1
@entity19 said the court ordered execution was carried out at 8:33 p.m. et. she said a final statement was given , expressing remorse to the family of the slain deputy			2
the state 's high court had also denied @entity0 's request for an appeal on the basis that it is unconstitutional to execute a person with his medical conditions and combat history			1
in denying clemency late monday , the @entity35 said , " in reaching its decision , in addition to hearing testimony during the meeting on monday , the board prior to the meeting had thoroughly reviewed the parole case file on the inmate , which includes the circumstances of the death penalty case , the inmate 's criminal history , and a comprehensive history of the inmate 's life			0
" attorneys for the 66 - year - old @entity0 had hoped his sentence would be found unconstitutional			1
his defense attorneys claim @entity0 , who served in @entity2 in the early 1970s , was suffering from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorder at the time of the shooting and was off his medication			2
in a petition filed monday with @entity62 , @entity0 's attorneys requested his life be spared because " executing @entity65 combat veterans whose service - related mental impairments played a role in subsequent violent conduct violates the @entity70 and @entity71 amendments to the @entity72 and analogous provisions of the @entity74			1
" the document went on to say " death is inappropriate for those with diminished capacities to understand and process information , to communicate , to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience , to engage in logical reasoning , to control impulses and to understand the reactions of others			0
" attorneys @entity87 and @entity88 , who represent @entity0 , say that the death penalty is reserved for the " worst of the worst " offenders who commit murder and that @entity0 does not fit that category			2
they contend his mental problems were directly related to his combat service and defense of the country 's interests and ideals			0
the killing of @entity102 deputy @entity100 was captured on the deputy 's dash camera just outside @entity105 , @entity6			1
versions of the video have been uploaded to @entity108			2
@entity0 is seen in the video confronting @entity110 after being pulled over for driving almost 100 mph in his pickup			2
@entity0 appears to be confrontational from the start , acting irrational as the deputy tells him to keep his hands out of his pocket			1
he then mocks the deputy and at one point seems to dance around yelling , " shoot me , " at @entity110			0
@entity0 then yells that he is a @entity2 veteran			2
he lunges at the deputy before he runs back to his truck , grabs a rifle and begins to shoot			0
the video goes on to show a heated gunbattle as both men hide behind their vehicles for cover			0
bullets appear to pierce the windshield of the deputy 's car			2
@entity0 's car door window shatters above his head			1
in the video , @entity110 and @entity0 are shot and wounded in the battle			0
@entity0 advances on the deputy , and off camera , you hear the deputy scream before @entity0 repeatedly shoots him and then flees the scene			1
@entity110 died , leaving behind a wife and child			0
@entity0 , who had no criminal record before the shooting , was convicted of the murder in 2000			0
during the trial , attorney @entity88 says the defense presented evidence that @entity0 suffered from ptsd but claims that crucial testimony from a @entity151 doctor treating him was never heard			0
his sentence was appealed , and a judge ordered a new sentencing trial , but that was later overturned by the @entity6 @entity7			1
@entity110 's father , @entity110 , posted on his @entity158 page this month that " january 12 , 2015 it will be 17 years since my son @entity160 was murdered in the line of duty and on january 13 , 2015 his killer will finally be held accountable			0
nothing will ever bring my son back , but finally some justice for the one who took him from his children and his family			0
" @entity1 's @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
