-- twenty years ago , when @entity2 turned 50 , he remembers his then - manager pushing the idea of retirement			1
" it 's only right , " he was told			2
" you really do n't want to go beyond 50 , it 's going to get embarrassing			1
" in june , @entity2 will be 70 ( " i 'm never going to believe i 'm 70 , i do n't care what you say , " he says			1
" there 's a little cell in my brain that 's never going to believe that " ) , and he still has no plans to stop touring or recording			1
" you get the argument ' make way for the young kids , ' " he says			0
" and you think , ' f * * * that , let them make way for themselves			0
if they 're better than me , they 'll beat me			0
' @entity27 do n't have a problem , they 're good			2
they 'll do their thing			0
" if you 're enjoying it , why do something else ? and what would you do ? well , a good answer is ' take more holidays , ' which is definitely on the cards , but i do n't seem to do that			1
i love what i do so much that i do n't really want to stop			1
i 'm just kind of casually keeping an eye on how i feel , and onstage , it feels like it 's always felt			1
so for the time being , the band 's hot , i 'm really enjoying myself , still singing like i sang , not experiencing , touch wood , any sort of problems to speak of			1
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it			2
" it does n't hurt that his touring schedule has been reduced to shorter , intense bursts in recent years , largely because of his shared - custody arrangement for his 8 - year - old , @entity51			1
" we do n't do the big sloggo tour , we do n't do the big @entity56 go - out - forever thing , and get a bit fed up with it , " says @entity2 , who 's planning some dates for later this year			1
" what we do now is events and selective dates			0
because of my custody situation , i can only do that			0
at first , we thought , ' oh , @entity64 , is this going to be a problem ? ' and it 's actually turned out to be some kind of a blessing			2
" he can see himself rocking well into his eighties			0
@entity71 pays tribute to ex-wife @entity73 " i can imagine it , " he says			0
" as to whether my imagination will come true , i do n't know			2
the last couple of years , i 've gotten into guitar -- so there 's all sorts of little things that crop up that entice you forward , and you go , ' hmm , i 'd like that			1
' " i broach the idea of actually dying onstage -- would he be into it ? he recoils slightly , then smiles			0
" what kind of question is that ? i must say , that 's not in my imagination			2
rocking on until a grand old age ... the only thing would be when it 's not pleasant anymore , then it would be ' that 's a good time to stop			1
' but it 's way too pleasant at the moment			0
but i know exactly where you 're coming from , though			0
how long can this go on ... ? " to read the rest of this cover story , pick up the march issue of @entity0 february 17			0
