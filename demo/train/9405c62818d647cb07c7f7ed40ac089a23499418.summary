if at first you do n't succeed , discuss			0
a day after @entity4 gov. @entity3 vetoed a " religious freedom " bill that critics say would have allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians , a supporter of the bill said that community appeared to need no special protection , thank you very much			0
" where are the examples of gays being discriminated against ? " @entity17 , president of the @entity18 , asked @entity20 's @entity19 , in an interview on " @entity22 " that became a spirited discussion of marriage			1
" if they 're so discriminated against , how come they make more money than straight people , on average ? " in fact , at least one survey has shown that gays and lesbians tend to earn more , save more , owe less and better prepare for retirement			1
@entity19 reversed the question to ask why people of faith would need special protection			1
he noted that proponents of the law had been unable to cite a single example of a business in @entity4 that was forced to do something that would have violated the religious beliefs of its owner			0
" you did n't need the law , " @entity19 said			1
referring to a court case that required a photo service in @entity51 to document a same - sex wedding ceremony , the anchor asked how the @entity18 photographer could have found that job to be a substantial burden to his faith			1
" i think , if people say , ' listen , i do n't want to sanction polygamy or gay marriage or anything other than traditional marriage , ' i think we need to respect that , " he said			1
" and if you do n't like it , you can shop around			0
it 's not hard for gays to find somebody to take a picture of them			2
" people of faith , he said , feel that their rights " are being whittled away in the name of gay rights			1
" " you need love " @entity17 then moved on from the @entity4 law to take aim at same - sex marriage in general			1
" it basically says that there is no profound difference , socially speaking , between a man and woman -- the only union that can create a family			1
" @entity19 noted that some people marry not to have children but because they seek life - long companionship and commitment			1
" you do n't have to be married to propagate , " he noted			0
" and you do n't have to have kids to be married			0
" why should heterosexual marriage be considered any different than gay marriage , he asked			1
citing his education as a sociologist , @entity17 had a ready answer : because heterosexual marriage is in the best interest of society			1
" kids do best in an intact family , " he said			2
" the evidence is overwhelming : you need a father and a mother			0
" " you need love , " responded @entity19			1
" and you need people to care for you -- gay or straight			1
" that rationale -- that love is all that 's needed as a condition for marriage -- could lead to a brother and sister tying the knot , @entity17 said			1
" that 's where we 're going with this thing -- polygamists , also			2
" @entity17 said gays and lesbians have individual rights , but contended that " the institution of marriage is best set when we have kids raised by a father and a mother			1
" he then went a step further : " maybe @entity132 want to get married			0
what are you going to say about that ? " @entity17 acknowledged that he could offer no evidence that children of gay or lesbian couples have outcomes any different from those of heterosexual parents , but said that was because the research had not been completed			1
" why would we want a social experiment with an institution that has served us well for over 2,000 years ? " he asked			0
" the gold standard is a father and a mother creating a family			2
that 's what was ordained by nature , and nature 's @entity155			2
" not true , said @entity19 , noting that the putative gold standard has been tarnished by a divorce rate of about 50 % , broken homes and latchkey kids			2
and nature ordaining marriage ? most mammals do not couple for life , he noted			2
@entity17 clung to his assertion			2
" have you noticed anatomically there 's a goodness of fit between a man and a woman ? " he asked			1
" nobody 's arguing that this is how you procreate , but marriage is about love and commitment and the right to it is about equality -- and you know that			1
" @entity17 : marriage based on duty and commitment " marriage is about family -- it 's not about love , " @entity17 said			1
" two sisters can love each other			2
" " marriage is not about love ? " an incredulous @entity19 asked			1
" are you married ? " @entity17 , who has been widely reported to be a divorced father of two adult children , did not address that question , but moved on			2
" marriage has always been based , historically , on duty and on commitment , " he said			0
" the duty , the commitment grow out of love , " responded @entity19			1
" if they love each other , that 's great , " said @entity17			1
" it ca n't be the condition -- otherwise , you can sanction all kinds of things			0
" the two men then returned to the topic that started their discussion			0
" in @entity4 , there was no legal force making business owners do business with gay people if they do n't want to , " @entity19 said			1
" so the law , fundamentally , was unnecessary			0
the governor said it ; that 's why she vetoed it			0
the bigger proposition is why do you want to discriminate against gays ? " @entity17 said he did not want to discriminate against gays as individuals , only as part of married couples			2
" but that 's the same thing , " said @entity19			1
" because their right as an individual is to marry			0
you do not own marriage			0
it was not developed by @entity234			0
it is a civil institution , secular			0
if they are equal , they have equal rights			0
" @entity17 ceded no ground , saying he had plenty of allies			2
" i have @entity242 , i have @entity243 , i have the @entity244 , i have @entity245 , i have most of the world who regard this idea as being bizarre that two men should get married			0
" @entity19 then drew a distinction between the @entity4 law and @entity252 , the leader of the @entity253 , who has refused to judge gays			1
" he 's saying forgive and he 's saying include			0
that 's not what that law was about , and that 's not what you 're saying			0
" " i do believe that people ought to love gays as we would straights , " @entity262 said			2
" i 'm all in favor of that , and discrimination against gays is wrong			0
" " i 'm making a distinction between individuals , " @entity262 added			0
" you 're bleeding the individual into the institution			0
i think , sociologically , that 's not correct			0

" have you noticed , anatomically , there 's a goodness of fit between a man and a woman ? " asks @entity17
" you need people to care for you -- gay or straight , " says @entity19
" marriage is about family -- it 's not about love , " says the @entity18 leader
