-- they were outside every polling station i visited in @entity4 : earnest young men bent over laptops on rickety tables , checking names and @entity10 numbers against voting lists , explaining to people where they were supposed to vote , and , in light of @entity16 's wildly complicated electoral system , how to vote			1
scattered around the tables between the laptops were pamphlets and fliers for candidates of the @entity22 , the newly established political wing of the once banned but now free and unfettered @entity24			1
" who does n't want freedom and justice ? " a middle - aged man asked me approvingly as i leafed through a pamphlet over at one of the tables in the working class @entity4 neighbourhood of @entity31			0
the " help " at the polls was just the tip of an organizational iceberg that may well ensure the movement emerges victorious from the first , critical round in @entity16 's first @entity40 parliamentary elections			1
@entity16 awaits election results both the movement 's leaders and rank - and - file are now quietly confident their moment is fast approaching			1
they have , after all , been working -- methodically and patiently -- to achieve it since the movement 's founding in 1928 in the city of @entity52 , on the @entity53			2
they 've come a long way since then -- occasionally operating openly , other times hounded by the police			2
shortly after @entity59 was ousted , the movement was legalized			1
journalists can now jettison the tired old phrase " banned but tolerated			0
" the @entity24 is unbound			1
the movement is well entrenched in mainstream @entity64 politics			1
its leaders do not appear to be wild - eyed fanatics			0
most are highly educated -- doctors , lawyers , engineers , professors , and businessmen -- and come from solidly middle - class backgrounds			0
some western observers see the @entity24 as a sinister , secretive society , feigning moderation and democracy in public while in private embracing an extremist , totalitarian , anti-western agenda			1
the movement 's @entity64 opponents frequently describe the @entity24 as sheep in wolves ' clothing			1
its members endured decades of persecution by the authorities , going back to the days of the monarchy			1
in the 1930s and 1940s the @entity24 were accused of assassinations and bombings - although the @entity24 always publicly rejected violence as a means to political ends			1
the secrecy that alarms some @entity64 may have simply been a necessity to function in an environment where the secret police , the mukhabarat , and their army of informers were watching everyone			1
whatever one thinks of the group , it is skilled at building broad popular support through its extensive network of charities and social services , and stepping forward in emergencies when the state has failed			2
in 1992 when an earthquake in @entity4 left hundreds of the city 's poor homeless , it was the @entity24 who quickly mobilized to provide food , blankets and medical care			1
the government 's reaction was criticized as slow , late , and clumsy			1
in 2006 , when a ferry sank between @entity125 and the @entity127 port of @entity128 carrying more than 1,000 workers from @entity16 , the @entity24 rushed relief supplies , only to have them blocked by the government			1
the first official reaction to the ship 's sinking , as i saw myself , was to send hundreds of riot police to @entity128			2
government relief supplies arrived three days later			2
in a country where the sheer mass of people sometimes overwhelms creaking government services , the @entity24 has won praise for its ability to create order out of chaos			1
" what 's wrong with good organisation ? " said @entity146 , production manager at an industrial printing press in @entity4 and @entity24 member			1
he was keeping an eye on the turnout at the @entity153 in @entity31			0
he smiled confidently as a steady flow of voters -- women to the left , men to the right - walked past him to cast their ballots			0
" when people see that we are well - organised now and were well - organised in the past , they will know we can use that organisation to achieve prosperity in the future , " he said			0
what men like @entity146 call public service , critics shrug off as cynical , opportunistic stunts to win popular support			0
for @entity16 's impoverished millions , however , motives do n't matter			1
they need all the help they can get			0
the @entity24 is often accused of opportunism , but , if that 's the case , it 's chosen its opportunities wisely			1
during this year 's uprising , the @entity24 kept a low profile , letting secular and leftist youth take the lead			1
when it became clear @entity59 's days were numbered , the @entity24 's presence in @entity186 increased steadily			1
the group 's leaders cheered the fall of @entity59 but never took credit for it			1
during the recent protests against the ruling @entity194 , the @entity24 stayed on the sidelines			1
they condemned what they called police brutality , but also rejected calls for them to join the protests			0
they were bitterly criticized by the activists in @entity186 , who warned they would be punished at the ballot box			0
but the people in @entity186 , not for the first time , misread the public mood			0
many @entity64 i spoke with outside the @entity186 said they were tired of demonstrations and clashes , wanted the elections to proceed , and wanted the country to settle down			1
the large turnout for the first two days of voting , and the dwindling numbers in @entity186 , suggest that the @entity24 once more played its cards well			1
call it opportunism , call it clever politics			0
the result is the same			0
i met 29 - year - old @entity220 as she was going up to the stairs of a school to vote in @entity31			0
" i 'm going to vote for the @entity22 ! " she proclaimed loudly			0
an office worker and mother of three , she listed her reasons for voting for the @entity226 : " if the @entity24 run the country , they 'll fix everything - health , housing , jobs , girls who walk around with their hair uncovered , girls who walk around in the wrong clothing			2
@entity236 willing , they 'll fix everything			0
" @entity220 was wearing a headscarf , hijab , not the full face - covering niqab favoured by the ultra-conservatives , so i was a bit taken aback			0
" you mean , " i asked , " the @entity24 will force women to wear the hijab ? " " no , no , " she responded			2
" they 'll just convince them it 's better for them			0
" and that seems to be the attitude of many members and supporters of the @entity24 -- that they 'll bring people over not by compulsion but rather by conviction and example			1
it 's an attitude 27 - year - old interior decorator @entity256 vehemently rejects			0
the @entity24 , said the unveiled @entity256 , " are just liars			2
they do n't do what they say			0
they use religion to convince people to vote for them			0
" obviously they had n't convinced her			0
she was waiting in line to vote " against the @entity24 , " she said			2
the movement 's leaders are well aware that many @entity64 , especially @entity267 , liberals , leftists and others , are wary of their growing power			1
@entity273 leader @entity272 is quick to reassure them they are all partners in a new democratic @entity16			2
" they are our friends , our neighbours , our citizens , they are @entity64 as we [ are ] , and they have the same rights and duties , and nobody can deny that , " he told me on the second day of voting			2
" if they oppose us , they are participating in building this country , and are correcting our mistakes , if we commit a mistake			0
and this is very important for a democratic system			0
" a few years ago i interviewed @entity294 , then the leader , or @entity296 , of the @entity24			2
@entity294 , a doctor , had worked in @entity297 but had also spent many years behind bars under @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity59			2
" a long - term guest of the government , " is how he described it with a chuckle			0
like so many @entity64 he had a sharp sense of humor			2
but the smile evaporated when he told me , " we are a religion , a mission , a programme			0
i do n't care what the government thinks			0
what concerns me is that @entity236 is satisfied			0
" @entity314 , the wizened old leader of the leftist , secular @entity315 shared with me his concerns about the @entity24			2
" so , if you are not with them , the @entity24 , with @entity236 's party , are you with the devil 's party ? " @entity314 spent time in prison with the @entity24 's @entity294 , and knows him well			1
he does n't trust the group			0
" if @entity236 's party reaches power , " he asked me , " who can move them away ? " " @entity236 's party " is closer today to power in @entity16 than it 's ever been .			1

@entity24 members had to endure decades of persecution by @entity64 authorities
it has drawn wide support in @entity16 during times of crisis when the government was seen as slow
it was *widely* involved in the protests that led to the fall of @entity59 's regime
but it remained on sidelines during recent protests against the ruling @entity194
