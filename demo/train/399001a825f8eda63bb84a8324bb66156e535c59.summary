@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 drives around the fairgrounds in his golf cart			1
the producer / director checks every nook and cranny the way a field commander checks his troops			1
@entity3 is the producer and director of the @entity13			1
@entity3 has been doing this 40 years ; he was one of the co-founders of the @entity13			1
if you were there the first year of the festival , count yourself among the elite ; there were just a few hundred people			2
this year , organizers expect 400,000 over the two weekends			2
despite the sour economy , @entity13 remains one of the areas economic mainstays , @entity3 said			1
@entity2 talked with @entity3 about the festival 's early years and its local artists			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity2 : tell me about the whole evolution of this , 40 years now			1
what it started out as , how big it was to the community back then , because now it 's synonymous with @entity0			0
@entity3 : we really set out to be an indigenous self - celebration [ of ] the culture -- like the world 's greatest backyard barbeque ... to celebrate the tradition of @entity0			1
and now , after 40 of these festivals , we really have become one of those traditions			2
we have three generations of festival - goers and now three generations of musicians and cooks whose grandkids are coming out here and playing music			2
@entity2 : in the early years , what was it like ? @entity3 : well , we started the festival in a place called @entity61 , which is very ironically historical because that was the birth of @entity63 music in the @entity65 continent and really the birth of the beat that became everything else we know in @entity65 music			1
it was very small ; it was the same sort of guts and bones			2
we had a @entity74 stage ; we had a little bitty tent with gospel singers in it			0
right on the grass , there was n't even a stage for that one			0
the same concept , marching brass bands , @entity84 , a little culture fest that was stuck onto a concert hall			0
we had @entity87 ; we had @entity88 ; we had big names			0
we were there for two years , and then we moved out here to the fairgrounds			2
@entity2 : and that was a great time in music , 40 years ago			1
@entity3 : an interesting thing about the evolution of this festival , being that it 's 88 percent @entity0 music			1
back in those days , the great musical thing about this festival was discovery			0
you know , you say , " oh , i 'll come down			0
i heard all these great bands			0
i 've never heard of any of them			0
i 'll walk from stage to stage			0
" now 40 years later , @entity0 music is at the forefront			1
our blues musicians , jazz musicians , @entity74 -- even they play at festivals all around the world			0
@entity2 : many artists and fans have described @entity13 as a spiritual experience			2
is that how you view it when organizing every year ? @entity3 : this festival always has been this sort of battery to recharge yourself , your spirit and your heart and soul			1
we saw the spirit that was out here after 9/11 [ and ] @entity132 -- four years ago , our entire city was destroyed by a flood			1
and now more than ever , our festival did what it does , and it showed people the healing power of music			0
and people came here in a way that was some sum that was greater than the parts , because people here really live on what music does to you			0
music is not as much entertainment here as it a medium to make you feel good .			0
