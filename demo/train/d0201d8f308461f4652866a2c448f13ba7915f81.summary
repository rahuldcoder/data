his parents remember @entity2 as such a happy child			1
he was 6 and full of joy , his mother , @entity4 , says			1
she said he was always smiling and described his laugh as infectious			2
when his dad would return to their @entity2 , @entity10 , home each day , @entity7 would run to his father , @entity12 , saying , " @entity13 ! " it 's been exactly a month since @entity7 and his teacher , @entity15 , and 24 other students and adults were killed by a lone gunman at @entity2			1
as would be expected , coping has been hard			2
" it 's a strange moment when you wake up in the morning and for that brief second everything is as it was , " she says			2
" and then you realize that nothing is ever as it was -- and never will be again			2
" on monday , after putting themselves " in a little cocoon , " as she put it , @entity4 decided it was time to tell the world about @entity7			1
" he was autistic , " she says , " but incredibly empathetic			0
" " he just wanted to have fun			0
" most of all , @entity7 loved to bounce on a trampoline in the family 's backyard , remembers his father			1
" i 'd say , ' go out on the trampoline ! ' @entity38 says			0
" and he would always say , ' are you coming , @entity13 ? ' " together , they would vault up on the trampoline and bounce , sometimes joined by @entity7 's brother , @entity41 , who is two years older			1
" if i did n't go , @entity7 would n't go , " @entity38 remembers			1
" he just wanted to have so much fun with me			0

so they are moving elsewhere in the community			0
" you ca n't drive up your driveway every day and see the house of a person who took your son 's life and who brought so much pain to so many people , " @entity4 said			1
" we are leaving that house			0
we will stay in @entity2 , but that 's just one thing too much			1
i ca n't do that every day			0
" and they have trouble answering @entity41 's questions , such as why ? and will this happen again ? @entity4 says these are not things an 8 - year - old should have to worry about			2
but @entity12 says it 's @entity41 's difficult questions that give them the will to get involved -- to try to make something positive come from the tragedy			2
" we 're just focusing on getting up each day , " @entity4 said			0
as she puts it , the family is " trying to find a way to make sense of this by taking some action and getting involved			0
" they 've started a fund in @entity7 's name to raise money to support programs and educational aids for other children with autism and other special needs			1
they have n't learned all the details of the massacre that happened on december 14			2
until now , they have n't felt much like watching tv or interacting with the outside world			0
but one detail has given the @entity111 comfort			0

" he said that @entity15 had been found with her arms wrapped around @entity7 ... that is what we had hoped for -- in a very strange sort of way to hope for something			1
" " she loved him and he loved her and she would 've looked after him no matter what , " she says , fighting back tears			0
" to know that he was with her , and that he was n't alone , that gives you a huge peace of mind ... to know that he was loved even in those last moments			0
" @entity136 says gun lobby stokes fear mother shoots home intruder			0
