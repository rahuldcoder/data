@entity0 -- @entity2 never expected to follow five generations of men into the family business , selling industrial gasses and welding supplies			1
then her father passed away and @entity9 , the youngest of his four children , stepped up			1
she became the first female president of @entity12 in @entity13			1
" i grew up working in the business , all of my siblings did			0
we would file , paint cylinders and work in the store			2
i got involved about 10 years ago working under my father , running operations for five years when he passed away , " recalls @entity9 , who still keeps her father 's office much the way he left it			1
" i 've continued to run it , and it 's done great			1
i 've been slowly purchasing it from my mom bit by bit			0
" but now the family history @entity9 was charged with preserving is at risk of ending			1
@entity12 is in @entity34 , @entity13 , an industrial park along a canal that connects to @entity37			1
when the waters of @entity39 surged , they engulfed 80 % of her inventory in 4 feet of water			1
she is still without any government help			0
finding joy among the wreckage : family photos returned @entity48 " it 's devastating			1
it 's just been a devastating process , " said @entity9 with tears in her eyes			1
" we 're just kind of this lost block at the end of @entity59 in @entity34 ( @entity13 )			0
i know all the businesses and all of the residents have been affected , but it seems like there has to be more help			0
" @entity9 estimates the destruction will put the business $ 700,000 to $ 800,000 in debt			1
she says @entity12 had no debt before the storm			1
" in 26 years , we 'd had not 1 inch of water , " she said			2
" we could n't afford to have more than the tiny bit of flood insurance that we had , and we did n't think we needed it			0
" in the days after @entity39 , @entity9 attended community meetings with other business owners hoping to find some assistance from the government or elsewhere			1
she also collected information from the @entity82 website and elsewhere online to determine what assistance might be available for her company			0
she found government loans with a 6 % interest rate			0
but her bank offered her a $ 1 million line of credit with a 3.2 % interest rate			0
map : see images of destruction , recovery across the @entity95 the @entity82 does not issue loans to businesses impacted by @entity39			1
the agency tells @entity1 it would only give a grant to a small business if it is located within a primary home or resident damaged by @entity39			1
but @entity82 is a federal partner of the @entity104 , which tells @entity1 it has two loan programs for businesses impacted by @entity39			1
the first is a disaster loan of up to $ 2 million for businesses that sustained physical damage			0
the interest rate begins at 4 % ( and goes higher ) for a term of up to 30 years			2
the @entity104 says only businesses with no other means of credit would qualify for the 4 % interest rate			2
the second is an economic injury disaster loan geared toward small businesses to cover operating expenses they would have otherwise been able to cover had the disaster not occurred			0
that loan is also capped at $ 2 million and comes with 4 % and higher interest rates for businesses , and a 3 % interest rate for nonprofits			2
as of friday , 302,412 disaster loan applications have been issued by the @entity104 in @entity0 , @entity127 and @entity128 -- 62,294 of those to businesses			0
if @entity9 ca n't get her business back up and running at full capacity , she fears her competitors will move in			2
she 's already seen her business slip 30 %			2
two days after the storm , when @entity9 first was able to get inside her company , she began to run it off the sidewalk with " business operations " run out of a tiny storage room facing the street			1
her employees use cell phones , generators and work off one computer and one printer perched atop a makeshift counter			1
customers are greeted by a sign that says " @entity12 is open , " but they still peak in through the roll - up garage door and ca n't believe it 's true			1
" sometimes they just roll up their window and yell out to see if we 're really here , " @entity9 said			2
@entity9 has barely been home since she reopened her business ; neither have her employees who have worked around the clock and on weekends			1
@entity12 employee @entity158 watched @entity2 grow up working alongside her father			1
he was hired back in 1995			0
" it 's my life , " he said			0
if it goes under , " i would go under , too , " @entity158 added			0
employees at @entity12 still have a sense of humor , despite all the difficulty			1
gas prices up in @entity39 - stricken areas they 've placed a stuffed lion in front of the darkened warehouse with a sign around its neck that reads : " we are as tough as it gets			2
" but inside , the business is struggling to get off its knees			0
you can tell the condition of the business by the cacophony of overwhelming sounds from all the machinery trying to keep it going in the absence of electrical power			0
outside , the droning noise of a massive generator competes with the roar of power tools being used by workers from @entity193 , as the power company tries to repair the electrical lines			0
you can still see the water line just above the circuit breaker boxes			0
inside , you hear a sizzle as the lights flicker on and off , the hiss of propane tanks powering heaters , the clanging of empty tanks being hauled in and out for refilling since the business lost all three of their trucks and one forklift			0
in another room , workers pound in new drywall and toss soggy merchandise into bags			0
the office phones only work when the generators are running and voicemail is n't functioning			2
when they turn off the generator at night , calls are transferred to cell phones			0
@entity34 was hit so hard by @entity39 that volunteers at the business next door are using blow dryers to dry piles of invoices one by one			1
the job is essential because their server was destroyed in the storm			0
the only thing that 's quiet is the nearby @entity232 , where the water receded			2
the canal was declared a federal superfund site , meaning its waters are considered in need of cleaning up			0
" they keep telling us the toxic stuff stayed at the bottom , but we just do n't know , " said @entity9			2
@entity243 community gives thanks even after @entity39 what 's next after @entity39 ?			1

@entity2 is the fifth generation to run @entity12
@entity39 engulfed 80 % of her inventory in 4 feet of water
it 's been devastating : " it seems like there has to be more help , " @entity9 says
she and her employees *deploy* hard work , generators and humor to keep things going
