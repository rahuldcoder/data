@entity1 editor @entity0 died in october , aged 93			1
he was a giant of journalism , a real lion			1
in fact after @entity8 and @entity9 and @entity10 and the taking down of president @entity12 in the mid- 1970s for corruption and subverting democracy , journalism schools in @entity7 were bursting at the seams with young would - be @entity9 and @entity17			2
@entity0 and his fearless reporters launched a thousand careers -- including mine			1
@entity21 was also a friend			2
i met him after his glory days as executive editor of the @entity25 ; he in his @entity27 years and i , a galavanting foreign correspondent			2
i admired the heck out of him			2
he was mesmerizing in the sheer breadth of his knowledge and his lifetime experience			1
for all his achievements and accomplishments , read my friend @entity35 's definitive obituary in the @entity37			0
@entity21 was also hilarious and courtly , ribald and bawdy , handsome and craggy and full of the best stories ever			0
at dinner , he could conjure up a whole spellbinding era of the history he had lived and covered -- before the main course was served -- and often in @entity44 ! and that was part of his gravitational pull ; @entity21 embodied a different era , when top - flight journalists were the friends and counselors of presidents , as he was to @entity52			0
and when need be , their adversary , as with the mounting @entity8 revelations			0
@entity21 defined the times when a headline , a story , a byline in the @entity60 , could shift history			0
the truth is , his reporters would have followed him through rings of fire			0
i consider myself unbelievably lucky to have worked for two of the great revolutionaries of our business , @entity67 who created @entity2 and changed the world with 24/7 global news , and @entity73 , the legendary tv innovator and creator of 60 minutes			0
i wish i could have worked for @entity21			0
but perhaps i was luckier , certainly i was enormously proud , to call him my friend			0
@entity77 a little earlier this year , renowned conductor @entity77 died , aged 84 , after a long and distinguished career as @entity79			1
while we were n't close friends , i think i can say we bonded through an extraordinary shared experience : the 2008 visit by the @entity84 to @entity85 , @entity86			1
in light of the @entity7 government accusing @entity86 of the massive hack - attack against @entity91 at the end of this year , it is extraordinary to look back and reflect on a different atmosphere that existed between the two countries for a brief moment in time			1
along with a large delegation of international press , i was invited to travel with the @entity84 on a cultural odyssey			0
@entity100 was thrilled ; just as ping pong diplomacy had opened the door to normalizing relations between the @entity7 and communist @entity104 , he told me he hoped musical diplomacy could do the same with one of the last bastions of entrenched communist dictatorship			0
and so one freezing , sunny morning in february , a planeload of enthusiasts all landed in @entity85 in a flourish the likes of which the government and the people had never seen			0
we watched as @entity77 and his musicians prepped and rehearsed , gave masterclasses to some of @entity86 's top musicians , and finally delivered a bravura performance on stage at the city 's main concert hall			1
the audience was treated to @entity129 tunes by @entity130 and the concert ended with one of @entity86 's best - loved folk songs , @entity134			1
@entity86 's invited elite were on their feet with standing ovations			1
and for two countries still officially at war , since the @entity140 ended only with an armistice , just imagine how it felt in that concert hall -- and for @entity86 listening on radio and tv at home -- to hear both countries ' national anthems played in public on stage for the first time			1
remember this was during the @entity153 -- @entity154 had called @entity86 part of the @entity156 , and yet change was in the air			1
away from the concert hall , i was one of a small group of journalists taken to the @entity164 nuclear plant , where then leader @entity165 had started mothballing crucial parts and freezing the weapons program			0
a few months later i went back to witness @entity86 blow up the plant 's iconic cooling tower			2
it seemed @entity77 and the @entity84 were on to something			2
but shortly thereafter @entity165 fell ill and died , his son @entity172 came to power with a ruthless streak , a penchant for testing his nuclear weapons , and apparently capable of massive cyber attacks on @entity7 's top companies			0
@entity77 died without realizing this dream , but i am grateful to have been there for that brief moment in time when he brought hope and the sound of beautiful music to @entity86			1
