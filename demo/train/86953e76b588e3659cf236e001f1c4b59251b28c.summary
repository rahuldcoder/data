-- smart cars are good for the environment , good for parking in cramped cities and good for a driver 's bottom line			1
then again , all that thinking gets turned upside down when the vehicles do			0
that 's what happened to four of these fuel - efficient vehicles in @entity12 , tossed aside like a piece of trash			1
why ? authorities do n't know , leaving @entity17 residents to speculate that anything from pranksters to people upset about hipsters			1
all @entity22 knows is what he saw -- a group of men , in the dark of night , walking up to one @entity27			0
" ( they ) all just huddled around it and then just lifted it up and set it on its hind legs , " @entity22 told @entity0 affiliate @entity28			0
the basically vertical vehicle that @entity22 described -- its front lights pointing toward the heavens -- was n't alone			2
two others in the same 1 - to 2 - square mile area were flipped on their side and one was on its roof , according to @entity12 police spokesman @entity40			1
tossing a smart car is n't necessarily easy , unless you compare to other vehicles			1
unoccupied , a typical one weighs just over 1,800 pounds ; a @entity45 , by contrast , clocks in at about 4,500 pounds			0
authorities have launched a felony vandalism investigation since the first calls came in around 1 a.m. monday , said @entity40			2
the police spokesman said witnesses identified the culprits as six to eight individuals dressed in black			2
if they end up convicted , they could be facing jail time and a felony			0
authorities have n't identified any suspects yet , and the fact the flippings took place in residential areas -- where surveillance video is n't likely -- makes the investigation a challenge			1
@entity69 , a @entity12 resident and smart car driver , speculates people simply acting out are to blame			1
and while she has n't been victimized , @entity69 says she 's not sure what she 'd do if that did happen			0
" i would be out of luck , " she told @entity28			0
" i would be out of a car , because i could n't afford to fix it			0

police got first reports early monday that 4 smart cars had been tossed
it all happened within a residential area of @entity12
authorities do n't have a *motive* , nor has anyone been arrested
