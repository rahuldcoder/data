this is @entity0 ! hello , everyone , and welcome on this friday , may 6th			1
and as we kick off today 's headlines , we 're beginning at @entity26			1
first up : @entity27 @entity28 : that 's the site of the @entity30 in @entity4 , which was targeted in the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
and it 's where president @entity33 was yesterday for a ceremony paying tribute to the victims of that violence			1
the president helped lay a wreath at @entity26			1
vice president @entity41 did the same thing at the @entity43 , which was another target of the 9/11 attacks			1
the president 's visit came days after the death of @entity49 , the man behind the attacks			1
@entity51 talked with two sisters who were in middle school on september 11th , 2001 , and whose father was killed in the attacks			2
@entity55 , father killed on 9/11 : it 's definitely mixed emotions , because you definitely feel relief that somebody that represents injustice and cruelty , that was responsible for the murder of my father , finally , the fact that he 's no longer on this earth brings a justice to the situation			1
but at the same time , it brings up all these emotions from that day when i found out that he died , and just knowing that my dad will never come back			2
and it 's hard to have that hole in your life , and that will never be , i 'll never get full closure on that			1

@entity116 , @entity118 @entity117 : for him to come here and to see faces of the firefighters who were killed on september 11th to and see the shrine that was erected in their honor really meant something to him			2
@entity108 : the president 's visit comes just 24 hours after announcing he would not release the photos of @entity49 after he was killed			1
it 's a decision that some disagree with , saying the photos offer closure and send a message			1
@entity134 , @entity135 host : this is what happens at the end to someone who threatens @entity103 and who kills @entity103			2
@entity108 : as the political discourse continues , so does the progress at @entity26			1
