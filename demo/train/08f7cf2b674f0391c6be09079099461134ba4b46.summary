-- election night could be a long one			2
many of the polls continue to show a tight race with the candidates remaining in a dead heat in the swing states			2
whoever wins the election , it might not be by much			2
close elections have produced challenges for the victor once he starts his term in the @entity15			1
if voters do n't provide a clear mandate , presidents often find that they have added challenges when dealing with @entity20 , as legislators have far less fear about the commander in chief			1
in 1916 , for example , president @entity24 won reelection against former @entity28 @entity27 by 23 electoral votes and 3.1 percent of the popular vote			2
the victory , which depended on @entity24 's assurances to keep the @entity33 out of war , hardened the lines of partisan battle			2
republicans returned to @entity38 angry about how he had used the potential for war against them , even as he ushered the nation into @entity45 soon after the election			0
during the war , and especially during the fight over the peace treaty that followed , @entity24 found little cooperation from republicans who felt confident that they could take him on in the home front			2
opinion : @entity55 's pointless speculation over election outcome when @entity60 sen. @entity59 defeated vice president @entity61 in 1960 by 84 electoral votes and only 0.2 percent of the popular vote , the conservative coalition of @entity58 and @entity50 in @entity20 read the close outcome as evidence that the young senator did not have a popular mandate			1
the fact that @entity58 did n't enjoy any coattails from his victory even made liberals and moderates nervous about going out too far on a limb for the president			0
on domestic policy , @entity59 found most of his legislation stifled in congressional committees through the time of his assassination			1
opinion : both parties have a huge race problem when former @entity86 gov. @entity85 squeaked out victory against president @entity88 in 1976 , the same pattern recurred			1
though @entity85 had excited many @entity58 during the primary by promising voters that they could trust him in the aftermath of @entity92 , he won by only 2.1 percent of the popular vote and 57 electoral votes			1
the nation was " hopeful , sort of , " quipped @entity96			0
during his first two years , @entity85 struggled to win support from his own party on issues like energy conservation , while @entity50 such as @entity101 felt emboldened to take him on over issues such as tax cuts and foreign policy			1
from the moment he entered office , the fragility of his election victory motivated @entity110 and @entity50 opponents , who both played a role in his defeat in 1980			0
@entity114 gov. @entity113 came under fire in 2000 when the @entity28 ordered an end to a recount in @entity118 , resulting in his winning the presidency against vice president @entity120 by five electoral votes			1
@entity113 lost the popular vote to @entity120 by 0.5 percent			1
many @entity58 felt that the election had been stolen from them			0
@entity113 was not deterred and governed as if he had a mandate , pushing through a massive tax cut in 2001			1
his political standing was helped by the fact that the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , created a sense of national emergency and inspired a " rally around the leader " effect			0
but stalemate soon set in , as @entity58 had little appetite to help him			0
opinion : what 's really at stake in election 2012 the 2004 election , which @entity113 won by 35 electoral votes and 2.4 percent of the popular vote , also generated controversy as some @entity58 felt that there had been voter suppression and rigged voting machines in the crucial state of @entity148 by @entity50 - supporting groups			1
republicans claimed there had been voter fraud in other states , like @entity154			0
@entity113 never received the political capital he expected from his reelection victory and saw most of his domestic legislative proposals languish			1
opinion : @entity159 vs. square @entity160 in today 's political era , every president -- even those who enjoy landslide victories -- faces immense challenges working in the current congressional environment			1
partisan polarization , interest - group politics and the 24 - hour media make legislating difficult			0
but narrow elections only make things worse , and this would be the case for either a second term for president @entity175 or a first term for @entity160			2
the situation would be even worse if certain states are contested , as occurred in 2000 , and if the chaos from @entity181 results in logistical problems in parts of the @entity184			0
the winner would walk into a toxic @entity38 environment with the perception that their mandate is thin			0
added to all of this is the fact that the winner of the electoral college vote might not be the winner of the popular vote , as has occurred a handful of other times in @entity33 history			0
of course , the polls could be off and we might be heading to another @entity201 defeats @entity203 moment , such as occurred in 1948 when the president proved the pollsters wrong and enjoyed a comfortable reelection victory			0
but since that 's probably not the case , we 'll be heading toward some rough times on @entity210 in the years ahead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1
