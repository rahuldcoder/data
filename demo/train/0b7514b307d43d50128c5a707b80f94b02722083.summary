-- it 's nearly 200 years old , and people still come back for more			2
ever since june 14 , 1839 , the quaint @entity4 town of @entity5 has been attracting spectators in their droves to its @entity8			1
what started off as a small collection of boat races -- held over just a single afternoon on the @entity12 near @entity13 -- has morphed into a five - day sporting and social extravaganza , where anyone who wants to be seen , attends			1
" @entity18 people like the old charm of it -- its continuity , the idea , the past , comfort in a changing world , " leading social commentator @entity25 told @entity0			2
" all those thing that i call the ' @entity33 ' things , " added @entity26 , referring to the hit television show " @entity33 , " which has won a legion of devoted fans around the globe thanks to its depiction of @entity32			2
like " @entity33 , " @entity37 lures visitors from both at home and abroad , reminding them all of an @entity40 of old -- the maiden regatta occurred two years into @entity44 @entity43 's near 64 - year reign over the country			1
originally offering up just one trophy to rowers -- the @entity48 , still today 's biggest prize -- this month 's 2014 edition boasted 20 different events on its 175th anniversary			2
the sporting aspect of the regatta , however , remains just one side of a rather lopsided coin			1
along with the likes of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , @entity37 has a strict dress code if you want to gain entry			1
lounge suits for the gentlemen and dresses -- " with a hemline below the knee " -- for the ladies is the order of the day			2
should the rowing not suffice , a " @entity77 " and " @entity78 " are some of the other delights on offer to visitors searching for other distractions			0
" the dress code is quirky and a bit quaint , but i think it adds to the atmosphere , and i love the flamboyance of the men 's colorful blazers , " says @entity0 's @entity79 , who attended @entity37 this year			1
" when i first went it was like a window to another culture			0
" it may not be representative of modern @entity94 , but it 's a throwback to a different era and a chance to spend the day in the sun with your friends , " added the @entity89 , who provides an outsider 's view of @entity37			1
" if you find that charming then you probably would go again , " remarks @entity26 of @entity37 's ability to repeatedly draw crowds of thousands year after year			1
@entity37 's ability to retain that charm arguably separates it from @entity94 's illustrious horse racing and tennis showpieces			1
the @entity4 identity that lies at its very core has been kept intact , yet to be eroded away by multimillion sponsorship deals , around - the - clock television coverage and an a-list celebrity guest lists that its bigger , more glamorous rivals wear as a badge of honor			0
" @entity37 is still relatively better preserved than the other events , " @entity26 observes			1
" the moment these things go on to full - on corporate , to full - on new - rich money , then they are spoiled and changed , and can never quite go back to how they were			0
" that @entity37 is set on the river and has n't got a horrible building adds to the charm , " adds @entity26 , who is no fan of the @entity124 -- " ugly and vulgar " -- that was built in 2006			1
@entity37 's picturesque setting on the @entity12 , with an idyllic town as its backdrop , provides the event with its unique feel			1
crowds line sections of the course , which at one mile and 550 yards ( 2,112 meters ) is longer than the standard international distance of 2 km. they often witness two races simultaneously , while up to 90 can take place on certain days			0
to complete the program by a reasonable hour on such occasions , races are started at five - minute intervals , meaning action aplenty for spectators			2
" it 's clearly on the social calendar , but if you 're actively involved in the sport it 's the pinnacle of rowing , and a chance to see a world - class competition , " says @entity145 , a former junior @entity94 rower who has competed at @entity5			1
" it 's something quintessentially @entity18 , and it has the feel of days gone past			0
" but while @entity37 's dream of " @entity40 " is still alive and kicking , @entity26 suggests it 's only a matter of time until the event follows in the footsteps taken by some of its rivals			1
in february , @entity58 signed a five - year sponsorship deal with @entity168 -- a company controlled by the @entity171 royal family -- while the influence of foreign investment on @entity18 sport has been clear for all to see since @entity176 billionaire @entity175 bought @entity177 in 2003			2
" they are being cherry - picked by rich foreigners , " @entity25 says of traditional " @entity179 " events			0
" it is an indication of what we are about			0
as @entity186 said , we are a ' nation of shopkeepers , ' we 'll sell anything to anybody			0
and do n't forget , the @entity191 ( a slang term used to describe @entity94 's aristocracy ) are n't in charge anymore			0
" it 's not new , but it 's the scale of it			0
it 's been happening since the very rich @entity199 came over in the 1890s , but they tried to fit in			0
" these new people , though , are so rich and not bothered about trying to fit in			0
" @entity26 says the authentic " englishness " of such social occasions has " considerably diminished			2
" " the people now look at things and say ' i want that one , ' without thinking why			0
they are going to want it to work their way rather than the other way around			0
