the extremist @entity1 militants sweeping across @entity2 may have a singular goal , but there 's a broad coalition of recruits from outside of the @entity8 willing to help them achieve it			1
the so - called @entity11 in @entity2 and @entity12 , or @entity13 , wants to establish an @entity15 state stretching from northern @entity12 into @entity2			1
and as the brutal terror group racks up victory after victory on the battlefield , more foreign fighters are considering joining their ranks			1
who are they ? three young men we spoke to have traveled to @entity12 to answer the call to jihad			1
they agreed to speak to us from the northwestern city of @entity28 over @entity29 , provided we masked their identities and did n't use their real names			2
@entity32 , as he asked to be called , is 25 years old and from @entity33			1
" i 'm from the south of @entity35			2
i grew up in a middle class family , " he told us			2
" life was easy back home			2
but the thing is : you can not practice @entity15 back home			2
we see all around us evil			2
" see maps : where @entity13 has taken over in @entity2 we spoke with @entity32 and his friends as so many of these young men do : online			1
their posts , many featuring photos of them posing with guns , attempt to make jihad sound cool			1
and this is a big draw to many youngsters who want to be part of this war , but have little or no combat experience			2
@entity13 claims to be fighting for justice , but in reality their campaign is about brutality			1
the group has committed massacres and acts of terror so extreme -- including a recent boast about executing @entity2 soldiers in cold blood -- that even @entity74 has disavowed them			1
i asked @entity32 if his family knows what he 's doing in @entity12			2
" they are not happy with me being here			2
but when i give them @entity82 ( their interpretation of @entity15 ) , they see the reality , they hear the reality from me that they do n't hear from the @entity87 , " he replied , after a pause			0
there are thousands like @entity32 from all across @entity90 in @entity12 and @entity2 , according to some estimates			0
the @entity92 , a security consulting firm , believes there are around 700 from @entity94 , 800 from @entity95 and almost 300 from @entity33			1
but these figures relate to people analysts have been able to track , and the true numbers may be even higher			0
and as @entity13 's onslaught in @entity2 grows , there are fears even more foreigners will be drawn to fight			1
last month , @entity105 officials said @entity106 , a 22 - year - old @entity105 known as @entity107 , drove a truck full of explosives into a @entity12 army position and detonated it , killing himself in the process			1
@entity32 says he was a friend of @entity107 's , and that they " clicked immediately " after they met to discuss their shared ideology			0
" he was the best person i have ever met in my life			0
he had the best character , " @entity32 said			0
" @entity107 believed this would allow him to go in and kill many of the enemy , including himself			0
he wanted this more than a bullet			0
he told me , ' if i go on this martyrdom mission , do n't go back to @entity35			0
ask @entity123 to keep you on this path			0
' " we asked @entity32 what @entity107 told him before he carried out the suicide attack			1
" he told me to just pray that @entity123 accepts me as a martyr , " @entity32 told us			0
" he told me first that he wants this so much and we have many stories of this people who are in these kind of operations , where they 've survived the explosion			0
and on the radio before he detonated the bomb he said , ' i see paradise and i can smell paradise			0
' this was seconds before he blew himself up			0
" @entity32 , inspired by his friend , said he too wants to carry out a suicide attack -- what he calls a martyrdom mission			1
but when asked if he would return to @entity33 to carry out an attack , he said no. " if i come back home , it will be when the black flag of @entity15 is flying over @entity149 , " he said			1
" i know some people have the intention of come back to do attacks			0
but me personally , i only have the intention of coming back as a conqueror			0
" @entity32 said his family is not aware of his plan to carry out a " martyr mission , " but when his time comes to carry out the attack , he said he 'll inform them			1
for now , @entity32 insisted that the immediate goal is to establish a caliphate in @entity12 and @entity2			0
when i asked if he would now take up arms with @entity13 , he said he was considering it			1
for @entity32 and others like him , the call to jihad is seemingly too strong to resist			1
