she said @entity4 christians are suffering as a result of " religious cleansing , " and she has urged more help for minorities who have fled their homes in @entity4			1
the @entity4 government has worked to be inclusive and accepting toward @entity13 , but daily intimidation has cowed the @entity32 community , with crosses removed from churches , priests afraid to wear their clerical garb , the faithful reluctant to attend church , and churches hiring private security guards			1
@entity4 's @entity32 population has fallen from as many as 1.4 million in 2003 to between 500,000 and 700,000 more recently , according to the @entity61			1
a recent commission report outlined chilling abuse that @entity13 suffer in @entity64 - dominated @entity4			1

almost a third are from the @entity91			0
the rest include @entity39 , who are @entity94 ; @entity95 , both @entity89 and @entity94 ; and @entity96 and other @entity97			0
@entity13 and other minorities represented about 3 percent of @entity4 's population before 2003 , but many have fled to @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , and other countries			1
the community includes many who are well - educated , including business people and professionals			0
they live in @entity20 and @entity110 , as well as in the city of @entity112 and the autonomous @entity114 region			0
the @entity32 community is predominant in northern @entity4 's @entity117 province , in the big city of @entity119 and in the nearby @entity120 , where many displaced @entity13 live			1
tensions in @entity117 province heightened a few months ago , after provincial officials blocked the creation of local police forces for the @entity120			0
then hundreds of @entity13 took to the streets in and around @entity119			2
they were protesting the demise of a national measure that would have included minority representation on the country 's provincial councils			0

one proposal calls for amending the constitution to get rid of language that gives @entity64 primacy			0
the constitution guarantees religious freedom and rights to all people , including @entity13 , but states unambiguously that " @entity64 is the official religion of the state and is a foundation source of legislation			0
" @entity4 @entity32 activists , such as @entity184 , project director of the @entity185 in @entity186 , favor the creation of a distinct region in the @entity120 -- where neither @entity189 nor @entity190 predominate			0
