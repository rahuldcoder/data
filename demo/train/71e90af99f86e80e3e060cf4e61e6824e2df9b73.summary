@entity0 -- @entity4 officials ' concerns over food contamination expanded beyond the country 's borders tuesday as tests detected radiation in ocean water offshore			1
plant operator @entity11 said that high levels of radioactive substances were found in seawater near the plant , but said that the results did not represent a threat to human health			1
" there should be no immediate health impact			2
if this situation continues for a long period of time , some impact can occur , " chief cabinet secretary @entity21 told reporters			1
the impact such radiation could have on marine life was unclear			1
@entity4 authorities were scheduled to measure radioactivity in waters around the plant on tuesday and wednesday , the @entity28 said			1
earlier seawater radiation monitoring detected levels of iodine - 131 that were 126.7 times higher than government - set standards , the electric company said on its website			1
its monitors detected cesium - 134 , which has a half - life of about two years , about 24.8 times higher than the government standards			2
@entity43 was found to be 16.5 times higher than the standard			0
the electric company detected these levels in seawater 100 meters ( 328 feet ) south of the nuclear power plant monday afternoon			2
radioactive particles disperse in the ocean , and the farther away from the shore a sample is taken , the less concentrated the contamination should be			0
because of the huge amount of dilution that happens in the ocean , there 's not much chance of deep - water fish being tainted , said @entity60 , a professor at @entity61 who studies soil and water contamination			0
" i think the ocean can handle that a lot better than the physical environment and population centers , " said @entity65 , an international security expert at the @entity66 and a @entity1 consultant			0
" we do n't want any of this to happen , but better it go out to sea than stay in @entity4			2
" winds have largely blown radioactive material emitted by the plant offshore since an earthquake and tsunami crippled cooling systems at the plant march 11			0
but tests have detected contamination of food grown near the plant			0
the @entity4 government has banned the sale of raw milk from @entity91 , where the plant is located , and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring @entity95 after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards , the country 's health ministry reported			1
and officials in @entity91 halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture			0
the government has also banned sales of spinach and milk from parts of @entity109 and @entity110 , according to the prime minister 's office			1
on tuesday @entity21 said contamination had not been detected in other agricultural products			0
" the products which are being grown in these areas are being monitored and the monitoring will continue , " he said			0
he urged consumers to " try not to panic , " noting that the government had stopped shipments of any farm products they believed could be contaminated			2
@entity21 has stressed that officials believe the levels of radiation in food -- while above the legal standards -- do not pose any immediate health risk , saying they were mostly dangerous only if consumed repeatedly over one 's lifetime			1
on monday a spokesman for the @entity131 said short - term exposure to food contaminated by radiation from @entity4 's damaged @entity136 nuclear plant poses no immediate health risk			1
tests have also detected radiation in tap water			2
on monday , authorities in the village of @entity143 urged residents to avoid drinking tap water that tests showed contained more than three times the maximum standard of radioactive iodine			2
water in other jurisdictions showed lesser signs of contamination , although far below levels of concern under @entity4 law , according to the @entity28 website			1
the @entity158 agency said it had received reports from @entity4 's government that six out of 46 samples tested positive for the iodine - 131 radioactive isotope			1
iodine and cesium isotopes are byproducts of nuclear fission in reactors such as the ones damaged in the march 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern @entity171 , @entity4 's main island			1
although iodine - 131 has a radioactive half - life of eight days , cesium - 137 's half - life is about 30 years			1
the decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast @entity4 hit by the earthquake , tsunami and other potential fallout from the @entity91 plant			2
@entity21 has said farmers will be compensated for revenue lost by the restrictions			0
" primarily this is due to the nuclear reactor accident , so we assume ( @entity11 ) will be held responsible for compensation			0
the government might take some supplementary action , " he said			0
@entity91 ranks among @entity4 's top producer of fruits , vegetables and rice			1
@entity95 , south of @entity91 , supplies @entity0 with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is @entity4 's third - largest pork producer			1
for radiation to be an issue for rice , the contamination would have to be more severe and prolonged that what has been seen so far , said @entity204 , the @entity61 professor			0
soil contamination was a huge issue around @entity208 , but the radiation emitted from the @entity136 plant is n't anywhere near that level , he said			0
" we 're not at that stage ; that 's the scenario you have to consider if contamination gets severe enough , " @entity204 said			0
@entity1 's @entity224 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0

high levels of radioactive substances have been found in seawater
the impact on marine life is unclear , and tests are *expected* to continue
tests also reveal radiation in milk and spinach
