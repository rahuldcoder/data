the fate of two @entity2 men whom @entity3 kidnapped and threatened to execute was unknown friday as the 72 - hour deadline that the militant group set apparently came and went			1
on tuesday , @entity3 released a video threatening to kill the two men -- @entity9 and @entity10 -- unless @entity2 paid the group $ 200 million within 72 hours			1
based on the time frame , the @entity2 government estimated that the ultimatum expired at 2:50 p.m. friday , @entity15 time ( 12:50 a.m. et friday ) , and scrambled to secure the men 's release			1
hours before the estimated deadline , an @entity3 spokesman told @entity2 broadcaster @entity20 that the group would release a statement " soon " about the hostages			1
that statement did n't come			1
when asked whether @entity3 has been in negotiations with the @entity2 government , the spokesman told @entity20 he would n't comment			1
@entity3 claims the ransom amount is the same as the financial aid pledged by @entity2 prime minister @entity29 to countries affected by the militant group			1
@entity2 officials have repeatedly stressed that their military , which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self - defense , is n't involved in the international airstrikes against @entity3 positions in @entity38 and @entity39			1
the @entity29 pledge is for humanitarian purposes , like helping refugees , not military purposes , @entity2 says			1
in his communication with @entity20 , the @entity3 spokesman said the group is aware of what @entity2 says -- and then he went on to call the @entity2 infidels for fighting with the group			1
@entity15 faces a dire predicament			1
it says it 's doing its best to communicate with @entity3			1
it wants to secure the hostages ' safe release , but it wo n't yield to threats			2
@entity2 chief cabinet secretary @entity54 said he was aware of reports that @entity3 would soon make a statement			1
" we are receiving many different pieces of information , but as a government , we can not really comment as to whether that information is authentic , " he said			2
caught in the middle are the two men , @entity9 and @entity64			2
as the apparent deadline approached , @entity9 's mother begged for her son 's life			2
" to all members of @entity3 , @entity9 is not the enemy of @entity3			2
please release him , " said the mother , @entity71			2
" there is so little time left before the deadline			1
" " i have been just crying for the last three days , filled with sadness			2
words fail to describe how i feel			2
@entity9 always has been a kind person ever since he was little			2
he was always saying , ' i want to save the lives of children in war zones			2
' " leading @entity2 news organizations have reported , citing unidentified government sources , that @entity9 's wife got an email in december from someone demanding $ 8 million to $ 16 million for her husband 's return			1
the government is trying to confirm if that email came from @entity3 , the reports said			2
if so , it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the $ 200 million it had publicly demanded			1
but the question is what , if anything , @entity2 is willing to give			1
@entity3 has a ruthless track record			0
it has released videos touting the killing of five @entity102 hostages since august			0
@entity29 has called @entity3 ' ultimatum over the two @entity2 men 's lives " unacceptable " and said the international community should n't give in to terrorists			1
but he and other government officials have n't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom			0
should nations just pay @entity3 ransom ? some details have emerged about what spurred the two @entity2 citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody @entity38 conflict			1
while they had different professions , the two men knew and talked to each other , said @entity64 's friend @entity119			0
@entity9 , an experienced freelance journalist , made a video in october near the @entity122 - @entity38 border before he embarked on a perilous journey into @entity3 - controlled territory			0
" it is my responsibility if something happens , " he explained			0
@entity9 , 47 , said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region			0
" @entity38 people suffering three years and a half			0
it 's enough , " he said			0
" so i would like to get the story of what @entity3 wants to do			0
" @entity135 , who had worked with @entity9 in @entity38 previously , says he warned him not to enter the @entity3 stronghold of @entity137			0
" i tell him it 's not safe for you , " @entity135 told @entity4			0
but @entity9 chose to go anyway , saying , " i am not @entity140 , i am not @entity141			0
i can go , " @entity135 recalled			0
the aims and activities in @entity38 of @entity10 , a 42 - year - old unemployed widower , are murkier			0
he originally headed to the war - ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company , said his friend @entity119			0
there , @entity64 met @entity9 , who gave him insights on how to survive there , @entity119 said			0
he also introduced him to rebel fighters , who are distinct from @entity3 even though both are fighting against @entity38 president @entity160 's forces			0
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded			0
that plea spurred @entity64 to start raising money for this cause after returning to @entity2 , according to @entity119			1
" i felt a chill when he said , after returning home , ( that ) he felt in @entity38 he was really living a life , " @entity119 said			0
" he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals			0
" @entity64 went back to @entity38 in july , a trip that @entity119 said he did n't know about at the time			1
@entity119 said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company			0
@entity64 was reportedly captured in august			0
