-- dressed modestly , with a red headscarf loosely draped over her head and shoulders , she steps onto the stage and nervously paces back and forth			2
waiting for the music to begin and break the silence , she almost misses her first note before quietly singing into the microphone			2
her voice chokes when one of four judges turns his chair to face her ; she awkwardly bows her head and smiles			2
but she sings more confidently when the sole female judge turns around a few minutes later			2
the singer is through to the next stage			1
in a country ranked by a @entity22 poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women in 2011 , what @entity18 did was brave			1
@entity18 was the only female contestant to have auditioned for the first series of " @entity27 " last year			2
and the claps and cheers that loudly resounded throughout the studio came from an audience of men			0
@entity33 -- a popular @entity34 singer who was a judge on the show -- said she turned her chair around purely because the contestant was a woman			1
" i had to do it , " she said			0
" she at least had the courage to come along , to step onto the stage			0
" but @entity41 says her own appearance on the show put her life at risk			1
dressed in fashionable , figure - hugging attire , certain religious hard liners were angered by the fact that her wardrobe lacked one item : a headscarf			0
in the view of her critics , women should be covered and compliant			1
as a result , @entity41 says mullahs threatened her with death			1
" they said that whoever kills this singer would go to heaven , " she recalls			2
" it was getting really difficult , i could n't go anywhere			0
i was basically a prisoner in my hotel room , i had bodyguards with me all the time			0
" @entity41 , 28 , was born and raised in @entity68 and left at the age of eight with her parents and five sisters for @entity73 , where she lived for a few years before heading to @entity75			1
she eventually settled in @entity77 in 2000			0
war and violence forced her family to flee @entity81			1
" all i have seen and have grown up with is war , guns and problems , " she says , recalling an incident when a rocket hit a tree in her garden in the early hours of the morning while she and her family were sleeping			0
" we used to hear the gunshots all the time , it had become so normal , " @entity41 says			1
" you heard them while you were just sitting there talking and it did n't even scare you			0
i remember all that when i was a child			0
" at the age of 24 , after convincing her family to allow her to pursue a career as a singer -- a profession which she says is looked down upon for @entity34 women -- @entity41 rose to fame in her homeland and travelled back and forth for television appearances and concerts			1
she released ' lady of the @entity110 , ' her first female - empowerment song , last year			0
it opens with provocative scenes of the violence and oppression experienced by @entity34 women			1
" who says i am a mother to this world ? " @entity41 sings			1
" i am nothing but a burden on the son 's shoulders , i am a slave because i am a wife , i am a headache when i am a sister			2
" the video , shot on the streets of @entity68 , was released during the time when the singer was receiving death threats			1
softly spoken yet self - assured , @entity41 says she is targeted because of her openness about women 's rights and not just because of how she dresses			1
" if i just did my concerts and my music , most of these extremists would not have cared so much as they are caring right now			0
" she also feels her aims are misinterpreted and that women should have the freedom to choose how they dress			2
" when i talk about freedom and women 's rights , it 's not that you have to take your scarves off			1
my mum wears a scarf and i respect that			0
" the gallery at the top of this page shows the contrast between @entity81 , past and present : during the 1950s to 1970s , women could walk the streets in skirts and high heels -- a far cry from the usual burqa - clad images which circulate today			1
" my mum was somebody who had chosen to wear a scarf , whereas my auntie would wear short skirts , " recalls @entity41			1
" they were free to do whatever they wanted ... my aunt is now having to cover up			0
she even has to cover up the new generation , her children , even more than her			0
" @entity41 is reminded of a story another aunt told her , about how she was walking down the street wearing a burqa and white slippers			1
members of the @entity175 , in power from 1994 to 2001 , saw her and beat her -- for wearing the color of their flag on her feet			0
" this was a 60 - year - old woman who had the freedom , when she was young , to go to school , work , have a normal life			0
and now , even though she was wearing a burqa , they picked on her because of her shoes			0
" @entity41 says she regularly receives a barrage of abusive messages on her @entity195 page , criticizing her for dressing liberally			1
but she is driven by those who value her work , especially girls and women who write appreciative letters and embrace her after concerts			2
however , there are some fans she is particularly concerned about : after holding a ladies - only concert a couple of months ago , she received messages pleading for help			2
she says mullahs had seen clips of a group of females attending the show -- and labelled them as whores			0
" they were so scared ; they only came out [ to the concert ] because of me , " @entity41 says			1
despite the singer 's efforts to reply and offer help , she has not heard back from them			1
" it 's something that 's stuck in my mind			2
" she pauses , her voice slightly breaking			0
" i 'm thinking about it all the time			0
" but @entity81 has seen some advances			1
women appearing on tv were forbidden under @entity175 rule : times have changed with shows like " @entity27			2
" women also have a say in the current presidential elections			2
their right to vote was reinstated after @entity235 and allied military toppled the @entity175 in 2001			0
" to other people it 's just an election , but it 's such an emotional time for me , " says @entity41 , " looking at these women voting with ink on their fingers and so much passion and hope			1
they have a choice to choose a leader now , before it was never the case			0
" personal reasons may stop her from participating as a judge on season two of " @entity27 , " set to run soon , she explains			0
but she asserts that the threats have not disheartened her			2
her next single , " champion , " will be released this year and bears another powerful message on women 's rights			1
" champion is about , no matter what you say to me , no matter what you do to me , i 'm not going to give up			0
" fact is , there is n't much that can stop @entity41 from carrying out her advocacy , which she feels is her duty to her fellow @entity34 women			1
" for me , since i 've been travelling to @entity81 , seen the women , heard the stories , seen the country from close , it has affected me so much			1
it has become my number one priority , more than anything else , even my music			0
and i 'm going to carry on doing it			0
