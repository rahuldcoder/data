-- for more than a year i 've tried to get @entity3 chairman @entity2 to make an appearance on my sunday morning news show on @entity6 , the nation 's second - largest black cable network			1
he has also been invited to appear on my daily segment on " the @entity9 , " with 8 million listeners			0
although @entity2 did tell me " yes " a year ago , on the day of the @entity12 primary debate in @entity13 , he has yet to show up and talk @entity12 politics to either of these audiences			1
this is no shock to me , because most white @entity12 i 've invited appear to be deathly afraid to accept invites to appear on both shows			1
in fact , it has been tough even getting a callback or an e-mail from @entity12 staffers			1
since the debut of my show , " @entity27 , " in september 2009 , we have had an open invitation for any member of the @entity30 or @entity31 to appear on the show			0
in four years , only four -- reps			0
@entity34 ( twice ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37 -- have appeared on the show			0
none was called a bigot or a racist			0
none was prevented from talking			0
we had polite , but firm , discourse on multiple issues			0
any of them would tell you i was more than fair , providing them with a forum to discuss their policy differences with president @entity55 and @entity56			0
think about that : even @entity12 backbenchers who rarely get called to appear on a national tv or radio show seem afraid to show up			2
you would think they 'd welcome a chance to share their policies with a constituency that routinely does n't vote for them			2
but @entity12 routinely pass it up , and then wonder why they do n't get the votes of blacks and other minorities			1
what i 'm describing points up a much larger problem with the @entity12 and its inability to speak to issues that all voters care about			1
that 's why i find it interesting that at the @entity12 retreat this past weekend in @entity80 , there was a session entitled , " coalitions - discussion on @entity82			1
" comms stands for " communications			0
" if @entity12 want to understand how to successfully communicate with minorities and women , it sure would help to actually go to the forums where minorities and women read , listen and watch			2
when @entity93 was chairman of the @entity3 , he appeared on my tv show and radio segments on many occasions			0
i could call him on his cell phone or at home and book him on a moment 's notice			0
see , @entity93 understood that if you want to communicate a policy to black people , it helps to talk to them			0
maybe his being black is the reason			0
the mental block that keeps the @entity12 from engaging black folks and others could have something to do with its perception of the issues we care about			1
for instance , a prominent black @entity12 in @entity115 told me about a presentation a few years ago with party elders about how they could attract black voters			1
when it was all done , this @entity12 said , the first comment from the floor was , " we are not going to support welfare			2
" the group of black republicans was puzzled : " we did n't even bring up welfare			2
what are you talking about ? " the @entity12 apparently has the idea that minorities do n't care about education , taxes , entrepreneurship , homeownership , and a litany of other issues			1
when republicans speak to black folks and the main thing they have to say is that the @entity12 is the party of @entity140 and he freed the slaves , then you have a problem			1
yes , @entity12 played a critical role in civil rights legislation during the 1950s and 1960s while @entity56 were obstructionists -- but it 's the @entity12 's concern for blacks and minorities in the last four decades that has been troubling and problematic			1
@entity12 consultants will say that cultivating minority voters is a waste of time			1
that 's a short - term view			0
i would think that allowing the opposition party to get 90 % of a group 's vote without lifting a finger -- because your own ineptitude prevents you from making your case -- means trouble long - term			0
republicans could compete for minority votes if they were actually interested in listening to the concerns of said voters			1
but if they just want to talk to minority voters and not listen , they can not compete			1
i know a bunch of african - americans who do n't self - identify as @entity56			0
they , and i am one of them , have voted for both @entity12 and @entity56			2
the issues that we care about vary			0
it 's not about ideology or party ; it 's about what you can do to be of help to those in need			0
if the @entity12 wants to learn how to communicate with minorities , it must listen to and work with the numerous minority republicans who have been shouting this from the rooftop for years			1
you want to hear evidence from a couple of white guys ? pick up the phone and call former @entity191 sen. @entity190 of @entity192			2
he enjoyed sizable black support because when he was mayor of @entity194 , he did n't avoid minorities and treat them as outcasts			1
he sat down with them , shared their concerns , and worked on public policy -- together			0
when he was governor of @entity203 , he earned a lot of black votes for the same reason as @entity190			1
he has urged the @entity12 to reach out			2
one issue where @entity12 are finding themselves working with black civil rights leaders and pastors is in the area of sentencing reform			1
african - americans see a legal system that has turned into a moneymaking machine for private prisons			0
@entity12 governors see state budgets out of control			2
a major civil rights leader told me he has found more success working with @entity12 governors than @entity224 governors on sentencing reform			1
this is an example of what happens when individuals sit down , talk , share their concerns , and find common ground			2
but as long as the @entity12 is scared to even sit down with black folks and other minorities , it can expect to keep getting dusted at the ballot box			1
and do n't look to blame anyone else but yourselves , when you were given the chance and your own ignorance prevented you from reaching across the divide to talk			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			0

@entity242 : @entity244 's @entity2 *dodges* appearing on @entity242 shows
he says @entity12 leaders in *general* avoid *interacting* with blacks ; they lose black votes this way
he says @entity12 leaders seem to think blacks do n't have same concerns as all @entity191
@entity242 : one area where @entity12 , minority voters might share goals : sentencing reform
