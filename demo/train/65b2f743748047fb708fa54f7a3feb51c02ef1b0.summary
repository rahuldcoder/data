-- for an awards show that 's not the @entity4 , the 2012 @entity1 attracted a good amount of attention			1
about 16.8 million people -- a slight dip from last year 's 17 million viewers -- tuned in to the event that elicited countless trending topics on @entity17 , status updates on @entity11 , inches in newspapers and articles online			1
yes , it 's that time of year again when starlets show off their best assets in designer gowns , tiny statues are handed out and the world gets to critique who worked the red carpet			2
awards season officially kicked off on television last sunday night with the @entity1 and the media was notably underwhelmed by the soiree while viewers seemed split on host @entity32 ' toned - down performance			1
so why not just change the channel ? awards shows are among the few glamorous @entity36 events that are open to the public , said @entity38 , a tv critic at the @entity39			1
but it 's not just about the glitz , the couture and the celebrity			0
" when even reality tv is scripted , there 's something refreshing about seeing something that could be unpredictable , " said @entity44 , the site director of @entity45			0
" you do n't know what ( the winners ) will say when they get up there			0
you might see a truly human moment from people who are usually ... on point			2
" nobody expected lead actress in a drama winner @entity60 to curse upon realizing she left her glasses at her seat at sunday 's @entity1			1
and nobody knew how presenters @entity64 and @entity66 would recover when the teleprompter malfunctioned ( by joking about doing a cold read in front of @entity70			0
) " someone is going to make a mistake , " @entity38 said			0
" somebody 's dress is going to be terrible			0
it 's a wonderful opportunity to vent about @entity36 and celebrity culture while also participating in it			0
" and social media has only amplified our will to participate			1
" people have been having @entity4 parties for years , " @entity44 said			2
" sitting around someone 's living room and making jokes			0
" it 's just that nobody could hear them , he said			0
" without the @entity89 , the @entity1 would n't be fun to watch , " @entity44 said			1
" fans and critics can instantly respond on @entity17 and comment back to these shows			2
in a way , awards shows are more fun now , regardless of the host and nominees			1
technology allows us to respond immediately			0
" the social media aspect also pressures viewers to watch the shows live			1
nobody wants to be the guy tweeting about @entity32 ' monologue halfway through the @entity1 , @entity44 said			2
" for social media , the @entity4 and the @entity1 , certainly , are giant @entity107 , " @entity38 said			1
" we whack away and send mean tweets and are hilariously funny and wicked			0
" @entity110 , founder and ceo of @entity112 , wrote in a column for @entity0 that he actually watched the recent globes live because of social media			1
" i did n't plan to watch the @entity1 , but as @entity17 and @entity11 lit up with buzz , i could n't help but be drawn in , " he wrote			1
even people who approach awards shows with the " i would never watch " attitude are still somehow in the know , @entity38 said			1
maybe they did n't watch it live , or they watched parts on @entity125 after the fact			2
either way , they 're aware of what happened			0
" tv is a true democracy , " she said			0
" if you want ( an awards show ) to go away , do n't watch it			1
if the ratings fall , it wo n't be on tv			0
... nothing is easier to get rid of than a tv show			2
