on the day of the shooting , @entity1 burst into his roommate 's room and demanded a ride to the airport immediately , said the source , who spoke to @entity39 on condition of anonymity			1
" that morning he does n't knock			2
he just opens the door and says , ' i need to leave			2
can you take me now ? ' " the source said			2
the roommate , who investigators believe did n't know about any shooting plot , dropped him off at the airport , a law enforcement official said			1
texts alarmed family meanwhile , his family back in @entity29 had been receiving alarming texts from @entity1 , indicating he was unhappy , according to an intelligence source with knowledge of the investigation			1
it was one of those text messages that made his family think something bad was about to happen			1

the gunman had a note that indicated the suspect made a " conscious decision to kill multiple @entity120 employees , " according to the affidavit			2
the note also apparently referred to the @entity149 and anti-government claims , a federal law enforcement official said			0
it 's not clear what gave rise to the references , and federal investigators have found no links to known groups and nothing in the suspect 's background to explain them			1
@entity161 is generally considered to be a conspiracy theory in which people suspect a group of elites is conspiring to form an authoritarian , one - world government			2

placement of police questioned the shooting has stirred questions about a recent repositioning of airport police officers around @entity3			1
airport police chief @entity250 said in the past year , he decided to move officers from behind a @entity120 security checkpoint to in front of it , where they also took on " greater responsibilities " such as monitoring both the arrival and departure floors of the terminal			1
" the threat ... at the airport does not exist behind security at that podium , the threat exists from the curbline on , " @entity250 said			2
" so ... we have our people stationed throughout the airport			2
" he said the nearest police officer to the site of friday 's initial shooting " was just moved to the front part of the airport			1
" @entity250 acknowledged the trade - off of having the officers roam a larger area rather than sit at a checkpoint			0
" so are they going to be in the exact same ( place ) , exactly where i 'd hoped they would be ? no , " he said			0

@entity120 : number of guns discovered in airports rising congressman speaks out @entity14 said better coordination between @entity120 officers and local law enforcement at the nation 's airports could help improve security at those locations			1
" i talked to the director of @entity120 , @entity281 , yesterday			0
we talked about a review of the policies at airports			0
every airport is a little bit different , but the coordination with the local police is key because remember , @entity120 officers are not armed , " he said			1
" i think it 's important we have the local law enforcement really at different points at the airport to protect not only the perimeter , but also things that could happen through security checkpoint , " he said			1
he also talked about the importance of using special @entity315 teams , short for @entity316			0
the teams are tasked with performing random , unpredictable baggage and security checks at transportation venues			2
@entity14 said @entity321 wants to further the use of such teams at airports " to make sure @entity15 people are safe and the traveling public are safe when they go to our airports			0
i think that better coordination with local law enforcement should help tremendously			0
" however , having said that , it 's very difficult to stop these types of attacks			2
anybody can show up , as we saw in the @entity336 with the shotgun			0
" he was referring to the september attack at the @entity336 in @entity339			0
" it 's almost like an open shopping mall , " he said , " so very difficult to protect			2
