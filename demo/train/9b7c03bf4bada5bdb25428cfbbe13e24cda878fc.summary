@entity0 -- significant progress was reportedly made last weekend in @entity3 toward a landmark nuclear agreement with @entity5			1
and , as talks concluded on november 10 , @entity7 secretary of @entity8 announced that negotiations will start again on november 20			0
despite the concerns of regional @entity7 allies like @entity14 and @entity15 , and also a significant number of legislators in the @entity18 , it is clear that the @entity20 administration is pushing strongly for deal as part of its wider @entity24 strategy			1
indeed , @entity8 has now spent more time negotiating with counterpart @entity5 officials than any other @entity7 high - level engagement for perhaps three decades			1
the seriousness of negotiations was emphasized by the fact that , as well as @entity8 and his @entity5 counterpart @entity31 , foreign ministers from @entity33 , the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , and the @entity38 deputy foreign minister , came together			2
if agreement can be reached , an interim deal ( potentially setting the ground for a later comprehensive agreement ) would reportedly see @entity5 's nuclear capacity capped for six months and opened up to @entity45 inspections			1
in exchange , @entity5 would be given limited , sequenced relief from sanctions			2
remaining disagreements reportedly include the status of the @entity52 heavy - water reactor , and production of highly enriched uranium -- both processes , that can potentially be used to produce nuclear weapons			2
a second problem to resolve is how to handle the existing @entity5 stockpile of uranium that @entity5 enriched to 20 %			2
@entity60 signs cooperation deal with @entity62 progress in nuclear diplomacy with @entity5 , combined with continued uncertainty in @entity66 and @entity67 , has refocused @entity69 's attention towards the @entity24 in a manner unanticipated by @entity20 only a few months ago			1
in addition to @entity66 and @entity67 , the administration has spent significant political capital resuming @entity14 - @entity75 peace talks			2
the urgency of @entity7 focus there reflects growing international conviction that , 20 years after the @entity79 began , the " window of opportunity " for securing a two - state solution may be receding			0
intensified @entity7 focus on the @entity24 has accentuated a shift , common to many recent re-elected presidents , of increased focus on foreign policy in second terms of office			1
in part , this reflects the fact that presidents often see foreign policy as key to the legacy they wish to build			1
for instance , after the 2001 terrorist attacks , @entity95 sought to spread his freedom agenda across the @entity24			0
@entity99 also devoted significant time to trying to secure a comprehensive @entity14 - @entity75 peace deal			0
as important as an @entity5 nuclear agreement might prove to be , the @entity24 is one of only two regions in which @entity20 is looking for legacy			1
since he was elected in 2008 , @entity106 in general , and @entity38 in particular , has assumed greater importance in @entity7 policy			0
to this end , @entity20 is seeking to continue the so - called pivot towards @entity112 through landmark initiatives like the @entity114			1
key threats , however , remain on the horizon to securing this re-orientation			0
these include a dramatic , sustained escalation of tension in the @entity24 ( perhaps in @entity66 or @entity67 ) ; and / or the remaining possibility of further terrorist attacks on the @entity7 homeland			0
as well as legacy - building , the likelihood of @entity20 concentrating more on foreign policy also reflects domestic @entity7 politics			1
particularly the intense polarization and gridlock of @entity69			0
since re-election , @entity20 has achieved little domestic policy success			1
his gun control bill was defeated , immigration reform faces significant opposition in the @entity136 - controlled @entity135 , and the prospect of a long - term federal budgetary " grand bargain " with @entity18 looks unlikely			1
moreover , implementation of his landmark healthcare initiative has been botched			0
many re-elected presidents in the post-war era have , like @entity20 , found it difficult to acquire domestic policy momentum			2
in part , this is because the party of re-elected presidents , as with the @entity150 now , often hold a weaker position in @entity18			0
thus @entity152 in 1956 , @entity153 in 1972 , and @entity99 in 1996 were all re-elected alongside @entity154 where both the @entity135 and @entity155 were controlled by their partisan opponents			0
another factor encouraging foreign policy focus in second terms is the fact that re-elected presidents have often been impacted by domestic scandals in recent decades			1
thus , @entity162 ended the @entity153 administration in 1974 , @entity164 badly damaged the @entity165 , and the @entity167 scandal led to @entity99 being impeached			0
since @entity20 's re-election , a series of problems have hit the administration			1
these include revelations that the @entity174 targeted some conservative groups for special scrutiny ; and the @entity178 's secret subpoenaing of private phone records of several @entity181 reporters and editors in the wake of a terrorist plot leak			0
even if @entity20 escapes further significant problems , he will not be able to avoid the " lame - duck " factor			2
that is , as a president can not seek more than two terms , political focus will refocus elsewhere , particularly after the november 2014 congressional ballots when the 2016 presidential election campaign kicks into gear			0
taken overall , @entity5 diplomatic progress and wider recent events in the @entity24 are therefore likely to accentuate the incentives for @entity20 to place increasing emphasis on foreign policy -- which @entity18 has less latitude over -- in his remaining period of office			1
and , this shift is only likely to be reinforced if , as anticipated , the @entity7 economic recovery continues to build up steam in 2014			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity20 administration seeking @entity5 deal as part of wider @entity24 strategy , says @entity215
deal would reportedly see @entity5 's nuclear capacity capped for six months , opened up to inspection
since re-election , @entity20 has achieved little policy success amid political gridlock - *hammond*
foreign policy allows @entity20 potential for long - term success , he adds
