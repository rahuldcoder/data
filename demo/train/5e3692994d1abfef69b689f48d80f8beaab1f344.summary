@entity0 -- the @entity2 is open to a " more constructive relationship with the @entity5 government " following the death of @entity7 on tuesday and the expulsion of two military attaches			1
however , the action against the @entity2 is " not a sign of strength , " according to a senior @entity12 administration official , describing the move as an internal political ploy to stir nationalistic fervor			1
the official said @entity5 's vice president , @entity19 , " is not charismatic " and is trying to sustain the @entity7 legacy and win an election by advancing " conspiracy theories			1
" @entity7 died of cancer , @entity19 said			1
president @entity12 said in a statement that the @entity2 " reaffirms its support for the @entity5 people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship " with @entity5 's government			1
" as @entity5 begins a new chapter in its history , the @entity2 remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles , the rule of law , and respect for human rights , " the statement said			1
@entity19 assumes the interim presidency and elections will be held in 30 days , @entity5 's foreign minister , @entity38 , said during an interview aired on state - run broadcaster @entity42			2
the @entity12 administration wants the election to be " free and fair and credible , " according to the administration official			1
@entity7 's death draws sympathy , anger @entity19 made no mention of running for election in his public comments on tuesday			0
but he is widely expected to be the @entity53 of @entity5 's candidate and is considered the frontrunner by @entity57 experts			0
the @entity2 will stay out of the election			0
and the administration official said it remains open to restoring diplomatic relations with an ambassador regardless of the winner			0
however , given what occurred on tuesday regarding charges by @entity5 against two @entity2 embassy attaches , the official said " we need to see more than we saw today			2
" the @entity2 were accused of plotting to destabilize the country , which the @entity70 dismissed			0
the administration official believes , however , it is " counterproductive to be at odds " with the @entity5 government			2
another administration official said expulsion of the @entity2 military aides was a sign the @entity5 leadership is feeling " uncertain , unsure and weak , " and that a more constructive relationship with the @entity2 was " really up to the @entity5 if they want that			1
" but senior @entity57 officials do n't expect the relationship to change dramatically in the short term primarily because @entity7 's system still exists			0
opinion : @entity7 used force of personality to win votes , influence leaders the @entity2 , these officials say , will want to see a break with that and movement toward a democratic process			1
the officials believe that @entity7 adherents led by @entity19 will want to maintain the same approach , but could be more pragmatic and less confrontational			0
however , there are strong @entity100 views on @entity101 and it would be difficult to confirm an ambassador			0
that could change if there is cooperation on issues like counter-narcotics or counter-terrorism , the officials said			0
the @entity12 administration is expected to try and get @entity5 to impose sanctions on @entity112 , which the country has repeatedly violated , they added			1
@entity57 experts believe @entity7 's death could change the dynamic in the region , not only between the @entity2 and @entity5 , but also among @entity57 countries			1
@entity119 , chairman of the @entity120 , said that @entity7 ruled " with an iron hand " and his death has left a " political void that we hope will be filled peacefully			0
" " with free and fair elections , @entity5 can begin to restore its once robust democracy and ensure respect for the human , political and civil rights of its people , " the @entity126 @entity125 said			2
@entity134 , chairman of the @entity135 , called @entity7 a " destabilizing force in @entity57 " and an obstacle to progress			0
" i hope his death provides an opportunity for a new chapter in @entity2 - @entity5 relations , " the @entity139 @entity138 said			2
