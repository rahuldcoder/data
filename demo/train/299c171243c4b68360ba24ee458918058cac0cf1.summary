another " tiger " has been caught			0
last week , @entity1 , the mayor of my hometown @entity4 , a major city in eastern @entity6 , was arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes worth about 20 million yuan ( $ 3.3 million ) after taking power in march , president @entity8 launched a high - profile anti-corruption campaign , vowing to catch both tigers and flies -- big and small corrupt officials			1
@entity6 has seen plenty of such campaigns , arising and subsiding like summer storms			1
but this one appears to be the most vigorous since @entity6 opened up ; when corruption became rampant in the new market economy and officials started to trade power for financial gains			1
much as i appreciate our president 's determination , his battle feels like an attempt to " put out a big fire with a glass of water , " given how corruption has reached every corner of our society			2
@entity6 public opinion surveys identify corruption as the most hated social problem , yet everyone is also guilty of it			1
last year , when my father fell seriously ill , we took him to a decent hospital close by but were told the beds were fully occupied			0
as always , we turned to our guanxi -- our network of connections -- for help			1
fortunately , a relative , a not so senior but well - connected official , managed to secure a private room at the hospital , which is reserved for ranking leaders			0
in return , the relative agreed to get the son of the hospital director into the most desirable school in @entity4			0
i became aware the weight of guanxi shortly after i was thrust into adulthood : at 16 i was dragged out of the school to work at a military rocket factory			2
two months later , when @entity60 came , my mother requested that i visit my boss ' home with gifts she had prepared			0
naive and embarrassed , i refused			0
mother angrily predicted : " you 'll never go far in life if you do n't know how to la guanxi ! " the verb la means to pull or to develop			1
sure enough , i never got any promotion during my decade - long stint at the factory even though i acquired a degree in mechanical engineering			0
for any @entity6 businessman , guanxi is essential			1
recently , i met up with a long - lost friend , with whom i marched in the @entity4 streets back in the spring of 1989 and shouted " @entity78 " -- one of the complaints that had sparked the unprecedented @entity81 democratic movement			0
more than 20 years later , this friend spends 90 % of his time running his high - tech company			0
his youthful idealism has gone and his waistline has expanded considerably			0
with a ghost of a smile , he blames it on the excessive dining , drinking and occasional visits to prostitutes that are part of the tiresome game of guanxi			1
" your business ca n't survive a day if you are not corrupt , " he told me			1
he has to smooth every step of his business with gifts or outright bribes : from obtaining the business license , to entertaining potential clients , to receiving 15 % of the tax deduction that a high - tech company is entitled to			0
he estimates that 3 % to 5 % of operating costs goes to guanxi			2
such practices drive entrepreneurs to seek senior officials as their patrons because politicians in @entity6 have the power to approve projects and allocate resources			1
the relationship between the now disgraced politician @entity118 and businessmen @entity120 , the founder of @entity121 , was typical of such patron - client relationships			2
@entity120 , a large man , allegedly fattened his pockets through his guanxi with the @entity125 as he funded the family 's jet - set life style			1
@entity120 was detained shortly after @entity118 's arrest and testified against @entity118 at his trial in august , although @entity120 has not been charged with any wrongdoing			0
local media reports suggest that authorities are investigating similar ties between the newly disgraced @entity4 mayor and @entity135 , the richest businessman in @entity136 , a city near @entity4 , who has also been placed under house arrest			0
and politically , @entity6 produces its top leaders more or less based on patron - client ties rather than meritocracy			1
both president @entity8 and @entity118 are " princelings " -- the children of senior leaders , the most powerful and influential group in @entity6			2
@entity146 , a form of corruption , has feudal roots			2
in fact , i believe the whole corrupt practice of guanxi is rooted in @entity6 's long tradition of renzhi -- rule of men rather than the rule of law			1
president @entity8 has called for a curb on official extravagance : no red carpet treatment , no luxury banquets and no fancy office buildings			0
but these are the symptoms not the root of the problem			0
to stamp out corruption , he will have to not only observe the rule of law but also introduce genuine political reforms that would allow checks and balances , transparency , and independent scrutiny			1
such remedies , although proven elsewhere , may be too strong for him to take			0
i do n't doubt that the authorities will net more tigers			2
but there will be hundreds and thousands more at large and countless flies , thriving in @entity6 's politically and culturally rich breeding ground for corruption .			1

everyone in @entity6 is guilty of corruption , says writer @entity187
use of guanxi or connections part of everyday life
businessmen say they ca n't survive unless they are corrupt
@entity6 needs to focus on rule of law not " rule of men "
