one icy sunday afternoon in january , 17 - year - old @entity1 's father drove her to the local indoor tennis courts in suburban @entity5 to hit a few balls with a high school friend			1
that night , she would be on a train to @entity9 for a photo shoot ; and a week later , on a plane to @entity12 for the haute couture catwalks			2
the unlikely itinerary sums up @entity1 's budding fashion career : a whirlwind trip from the mundane life of an @entity19 teenager to the rarefied heights of international style and back again -- accompanied by no small amount of adolescent bewilderment			1
" i would never think that a girl who spent most of her childhood with a unibrow , glasses and a @entity31 shirt would be in @entity32 , " @entity1 told @entity2 from her parent 's home , where she still resides when she 's not working			1
at 6 feet 1 inch tall , @entity1 is hard to miss with her gangly stature alone			1
add the high cheekbones , intense eyes , symmetrical face and prominent ears , and it 's a design for constant queries about her lineage from passersby			2
" people are always asking me , ' where are you from ? ' and i 'm like , ' @entity19 ... i 'm @entity19 , ' " @entity1 said			1
but she said the features that earned her teasing nicknames like " praying mantis " and " alien " growing up have set her apart with a coveted allure in the fashion industry			2
" i 'm kind of , i guess , embracing that alien , rat , demon , goblin , gremlin sort of vibe and going with it , " she said			2
@entity1 said before she started in fashion , people would often approach her at the mall to ask whether she was a model , but she never gave it serious thought , especially as she struggled with her looks as other girls matured			1
" i still kind of resemble a 13 - year - old boy , " she joked			0
she equated modeling with commercial beauties like @entity70 's @entity69 models with their long locks and tan , svelte forms			0
but on the editorial side of the spectrum , it 's often the quirk that works -- and it has helped her forge an unusual bond with fellow models			2
" i think it 's because we 're kind of a community of people who have always been the strange , tall , skinny people , " @entity1 said			1
" it 's crazy how i 've instantly found so many people who are so similar to me			0
i 've never been able to make friends so quickly			0
" @entity1 was only discovered last july in a @entity9 flea market by an agent from @entity90 , who said they represented top talents like @entity69 angel @entity93 and runway mainstay @entity95			1
" i had no idea who those people were			0
i thought it was a scam , " @entity1 said			1
still , she took the agent 's email address and allowed her to take some quick head shots before laughing it off with friends			0
after realizing that the agency was not only legitimate but one of the top agencies in the country through a quick online search , she and her mother traveled back up to @entity9 a week later -- and " everything started to happen			0
" in less than a year , she 's walked for major - league designers like @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , as well as appeared in @entity32 , @entity117 and a campaign for @entity19 brand coach			0
but there 's still a learning curve , especially for someone who three months ago was filling out college applications and thinking about majoring in computer science or a career in environmental lobbying			0
" i wore heels one time before fashion			0
and it was at my eighth grade graduation , and they were platforms ... and i actually fell down the stairs			0
so i 've always had a kind of very unhealthy relationship with heels , " @entity1 said			1
but beyond the superficial , @entity1 said the career has given her a new look on acceptance , an odd take to hear in an industry that 's often criticized for its unrealistic beauty standards			1
" i think being a model and being in fashion has really opened up my eyes to beauty in general			2
i think that beauty really comes from uniqueness			0

@entity1 is a model to watch during @entity151
she was only discovered in july 2014 , and already has an *impressive* *portfolio*
@entity1 says her look has been called " alien " but it works for her
