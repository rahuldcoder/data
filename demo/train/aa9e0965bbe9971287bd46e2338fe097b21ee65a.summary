@entity0 -- carved out of the wilderness of the @entity3 , @entity0 started as an outpost for frontiersmen trying to strike it rich in the @entity7			1
generations later , industries such as @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 rose up , transforming this frontier town into a cutting edge city and tourist destination			1
but even in the midst of a modern metropolis you do n't have to go far to find incredible natural beauty			0
where can you get the best view of the city ? skip the @entity24 and its $ 18 ticket price and head to the viewpoint at @entity28 , where you can enjoy the city 's spectacular scenery free of charge			1
the park has great views of the needle , the spinning globe on top of the old @entity38 newspaper building and ferries busily bringing people across the water to and from downtown			0
on clear evenings , photographers line up to get a shot of the sun falling on @entity47			0
which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion ? @entity0 has so much delicious food and so many terrific restaurants that there is no excuse for having a bad meal			1
my wife , @entity60 , and i always end up coming back to a tiny place we love called how to @entity63 a @entity64			0
the menu is eclectic with simple but fresh pasta dishes and small seafood plates that are meant to be shared			1
you get the feeling the cooks are serving what they feel like making			0
we keep coming back and are consistently blown away			0
what is your favorite neighborhood ? a popular t - shirt i often see around @entity76 describes the neighborhood as " a sleepy drinking village with a condo problem			1
" while @entity76 may have turned trendy , its blue - collar roots have n't altogether disappeared			1
you can still find salty fishermen occupying well - worn barstools along @entity85			2
at night , many of those same bars are filled with people soaking up the neighborhood 's terrific music scene			2
@entity76 's sunday market is people - watching central as stands are set up to offer freshly caught salmon , pizza from a wood - burning oven on wheels and even advice , from one guy ready to peddle his			1
how do tourists stick out , and what 's the best way to blend in ? according to locals , only tourists use umbrellas			2
during @entity0 's wet and gray winter , it is somewhat surreal to see people out and about jogging and riding their bikes			1
but as new arrivals quickly find out , if you wait for nice weather , you can wait here for a long time			0
what 's the biggest misconception about your city ? @entity0 's bad weather is so notorious people believe it pours here nonstop			1
in reality , @entity0 rain is more of a constant drizzle			1
that combined with the painfully short winter days can sometimes be tough to take			0
i have friends who buy sunlamps and take vitamin d to get through the winters			0
but the winters are soon forgotten when summer rolls around			0
a long summer day in @entity0 with the backdrop of white mountaintops against the deep blue of the @entity134 is one of the most beautiful sights in the world			1
where do you go to relax ? just 15 minutes or so from downtown @entity0 is @entity140 , a 534 - acre protected oasis of natural beauty			1
a well - worn path takes you through fern - covered trees to the water , where you might see bald eagles or even whales			2
that a place so natural and green is able to exist within a city is truly amazing			2
for a weekend trip , there 's no better outing than a visit to the @entity156			2
a short ferry ride will take you over to the peninsula , where snow - capped mountains rise from the @entity161			2
there are still plenty of wild places to explore there , including the @entity166 , where the thick tree cover can fool you into thinking you 've wandered into @entity169			0
one summer , my wife and i camped on the @entity156 's @entity172			2
just as the sun was setting , a fat seal swam out of the ocean right in front of us and looked as if he was about to come over and dry himself off at our camp fire			0
what 's the biggest tourist trap ? is there a tourist trap that 's actually worth seeing ? @entity0 is rightly famous for its @entity186			1
in the summer when the cruise boats to @entity189 are in full swing , it seems like the market is filled to the point of exploding with camera - toting , fanny pack - wearing out - of - towners			2
but the 103 - year - old market survives not just from the tourists but also because legions of @entity0 residents keep coming back for the amazingly fresh seafood and produce			1
my favorite stop is @entity201 , celebrating its 100th year in the market			0
they may not throw your fish when you buy it , but with scallops the size of your fist , whole salmon and giant lobsters for sale , you 'll hardly be complaining			0
where was your most memorable meal ? just a seaplane or ferry ride away from @entity0 are the @entity217 , which the @entity218 and @entity219 almost went to war over 150 years ago			1
the first time i went there , i remember going kayaking and seeing killer whales hunting for salmon just off shore			0
at one point they swam so near to us , we grabbed onto floating kelp beds to keep out of their way			0
that night , still buzzed from the excitement of the seeing these amazing creatures up close , we went to @entity235 in friday harbor			0
the restaurant is tucked back in the woods			0
the food -- much of it picked or caught on the island -- is delicious			0
there were smoked oysters and huge panko - crusted calamari			2
the meal and the entire day were unforgettable			0
are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try ? i tell any one who comes to visit me in @entity0 that the one thing they have to try is the wild salmon that is readily available here			1
friends who say they do n't care for the fishy flavor of salmon do not recognize the taste of the fresh fish you eat in @entity0			1
you can find plenty of salmon on the menu in the city 's fine restaurants , but for me there is no way to better prepare it than on my backyard grill with a little salt and pepper			1
what is a good local souvenir ? in @entity0 , good coffee is abundant			1
you do n't have to go far to get a cup of it either			0
in fact , at the drive - through espresso booths , you do n't even need to get out of your car ! but then there are the specialty coffee places where the staff is into coffee in a way that borders on scary : holding coffee tastings , traveling around the world looking for the next java flavor and roasting their beans in store			2
@entity291 is one of those places working to elevate coffee - making into an art form			0
bring a bag of local coffee back home with you to extend your visit to @entity0 just a little longer .			1

big industries transformed @entity0 into a cutting - edge city and tourist destination
the view from @entity28 is better and *cheaper* than the @entity24
@entity0 's infamous rain is really more of a constant drizzle
@entity186 offers amazingly fresh seafood and produce
