-- @entity1 figures he flies about 100,000 miles a year			0
he knows he 's going to see a healthy share of flight delays regardless of where he goes			2
a new study says delays will continue to frustrate fliers like this man at @entity10 's @entity9			1
but he especially anticipates them at the larger airports , such as @entity14 's @entity13 -- " you ca n't possibly put that many planes there and not have a delay , " he said -- and @entity20 's @entity19			2
so when he has a choice between two connecting cities , he said he 'll generally choose the smaller one			1
delays at the larger airports , he said , are compounded by other hassles such as longer distances between terminals			0
" there 's wear and tear on your travel psyche -- which bus you need , which terminal you should be at , " said @entity1 , a 54 - year - old @entity29 , @entity30 , resident who owns businesses around the globe			1
" by the time you get to your destination , you 're bound to come up frazzled			0
" delays contribute to that frustration , and there may be more of it to go around these days			0
though the percentage of delayed @entity50 flights has dipped recently because fewer planes are flying during the recession , there 's been a 20 - year trend of increasing delays , and the increases should continue once economic growth returns , a study released thursday by the @entity46 said			1
the average length of @entity50 flight delays rose from 40.9 minutes in 1990 to 56.5 minutes in june 2009 , according to the study , " @entity57 : an analysis of @entity62 in the @entity50			2
" it also found that among delayed flights , the share of those that landed at least two hours late more than doubled from 4.3 percent in 1990 to 10.1 percent in may 2009			0
and in a 12 - month period ending in june 2009 , the majority of delays was concentrated in 26 metropolitan areas , or hub cities , the study said			1
of these 26 hub cities , six had worse - than - average , on - time percentages for both arrivals and departures : @entity20 ; @entity14 , @entity76 ; @entity77 , @entity78 ; @entity79 , @entity80 ; @entity81 , @entity82 ; and @entity83 , @entity84			1
the nationwide on - time arrival rate was 78.9 percent , and the departure rate was similar , study co-author @entity85 said			1
@entity20 's on - time arrival rate , 66.3 percent , was worst in the nation , said the study , which analyzed air travel between metro areas rather than airports			1
delays are going to get worse , study co-author @entity94 said			2
" on - time performance has improved recently because the number of people flying is at its lowest point since 9/11 , but as the economy bounces back , air passenger levels will grow , and on - time performance will likely resume its decline			1
" the hub cities that did better than the national average for both arrivals and departures were @entity108 , @entity109 ; @entity110 , @entity111 ; @entity112 , @entity113 ; and @entity10			1
the study said on - time performance generally decreases as air travel increases			1
in 1990 , with more than 400,000 domestic passengers nationwide , the country 's on - time flight percentage was just under 80 percent			1
in 2007 , with nearly 700,000 domestic passengers , the on - time rate was around 74 percent			2
the authors recommend @entity123 and other authorities use the findings to help decide where to invest in high - speed rail projects and other measures to ease airport congestion			1
@entity130 , president of @entity132 aviation consulting firm @entity131 , is critical of the recommendation , saying the country could handle the current flight demand -- and cut delays -- by improving its air traffic control system			1
the old system , he said , is outdated , does n't use all of the sky and directs planes to fly farther and longer than they need to			2
" instead of saying , ' let 's get a system that can handle the traffic , ' @entity46 wants to lessen the demand			1
that 's a caveman mentality , " @entity130 said			2
@entity148 , transportation policy director for the @entity149 , said the study " hit the nail on the head in terms of the opportunity " to promote alternative modes of transportation			0
" the planes waste a lot of fuel idling on the tarmac and during takeoff and landing cycles of flight			0
so the lowest - hanging fruit available for reducing emissions -- beyond changing plane designs and changing the fuel mix in planes -- is to reduce congestion at airports and to go after short haul flights , where a greater percentage of the flight is made up of takeoff and landing cycles , where most of the emissions are , " @entity148 said			2
airplane passengers can take steps to cushion the impact of a delay or lower the chance of getting on a delayed flight , @entity130 said			0
passengers should only choose connection flights that depart at least an hour after their first plane 's scheduled landing , he said			0
also , he said , people who book a flight just a day or two in advance should look at weather forecasts			0
" if there 's bad weather in @entity14 , do n't go through @entity14 " if you do n't have to , @entity130 said			0
@entity194 's recommendation , besides trying to avoid busier airports , is to treat airline workers with respect			0
" the agents have a lot of discretion , and they 're human beings			0
if you treat them like dirt and are screaming [ because of a delay ] , you know what the result is going to be , " he said			0
" if you [ treat them well ] , you 'll probably find they 'll be willing to help you			0
" @entity0 's @entity210 contributed to this report .			0

major hub cities are *bottleneck* for air traffic , @entity46 study says
*frequent* flier advises connecting through smaller cities when possible
aviation *expert* says there 's plenty of room for *streamlining* existing system
@entity227 's authors advocate using high - speed rail to alleviate runway congestion
