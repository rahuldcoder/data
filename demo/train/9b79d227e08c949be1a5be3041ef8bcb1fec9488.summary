-- hours after january 12 's earthquake in @entity2 , drs. @entity3 and @entity4 were treating more than 100 wounded people -- not in a medical facility but outside their own @entity8 home			1
city medical facilities were decimated or overwhelmed , and makeshift triage areas like the one in the @entity12 ' yard tried to keep patients alive long enough to get the next available hospital bed			1
@entity4 called her daughter in @entity16 to assure her the couple was fine and to make a request			1
" she was overwhelmed with patients , " said @entity19 , a 28 - year - old @entity20 staff sergeant studying to be a physician 's assistant			1
" she needed me to come help			2
" @entity4 and eight @entity26 - based relatives and friends -- all of whom were raised in or have relatives in @entity2 -- went to the @entity32 ' @entity2 home to assist the doctors , deliver food and first - aid supplies , and to see how their loved ones fared			1
@entity4 , who was granted time off from the @entity20 , and her cousin @entity38 have been documenting their trip on @entity0 's @entity40			1
they talked to @entity0 by phone on thursday , their seventh day in @entity2 ; the group planned to return to the @entity26 this weekend			1
ireport.com : @entity19 and @entity38 's journey to @entity2 the nine , none of whom had any medical experience except for @entity4 , flew to the @entity49 and traveled by bus to @entity2 's capital on january 15			1
at the @entity57 ' house , one of the few in the neighborhood that did n't collapse , patients were in bad shape			2
" i 've seen crushed bones , fractures , dislocations , a lot of lacerations			2
we 've had kids who lost digits , " @entity19 said			2
" we 've also had people just suffering from just diabetes or high blood pressure , whose medication was stuck in their [ destroyed ] house , so they 're going into diabetic comas			2
" many patients needed surgery , but the one surgeon assisting the couple had no post-school experience			2
the @entity57 ' home , stocked mostly with first aid and suture kits and over-the - counter medications , had " no surgical capabilities outside of sutures , " @entity19 said			1
because surgeries could n't be done immediately and infection was setting in , many patients would need amputation later			2
a few people died before @entity4 's group arrived , and one has died since , after being moved to a hospital , she said			2
@entity40 : list of missing , found are you there ? @entity19 dressed bandages and took vital signs			2
the other eight from the @entity26 made sure patients took medication , sterilized tools and did small dressing changes			1
the crew also tried to find hospitals that could take the critical patients , she said			2
patients rest on mattresses in the yard , covered by tents			0
food , water and medical supplies , though bolstered by trips to the @entity49 and aid brought by others , are constantly low			1
the family eats whatever it serves to the patients -- perhaps rice , beans and tuna -- and sometimes it 's just one meal , @entity4 said			1
" we 're basically out of painkillers			0
we receive a lot of medication for adults , but not for kids , so children are barely getting painkillers at all , " she said			0
@entity4 , who was born in @entity133 but was raised in @entity2 , says her feelings are difficult to put in words			0
" it can be very depressing , " she said in @entity8 , in and around which tens of thousands were killed in the quake			1
" after a while , you 're looking at the things you ca n't do			0
... some people beg for water , and we do n't have water for us to drink			0
" " people look calm and try to go on with life and joke , but then a scared , panicked look comes over their faces when a helicopter flies overhead , because it sounds like an aftershock , " she added			1
full coverage @entity157 updates @entity2 took the wounded to the @entity57 ' house after the quake because they knew they were doctors			1
they also knew that @entity163 , a pediatrician who heads the @entity164 and directs @entity161 's disaster preparedness committee for @entity2 , sometimes sees patients at his home , @entity161 spokeswoman @entity160 said			2
besides tending to patients , the @entity26 nine have connected with relatives to find out who survived			1
not all the news was good			0
@entity172 , 25 , of @entity173 , @entity174 , said her parents ' @entity8 - area house collapsed during the quake , killing her grandfather and a maid			1
also killed was the best friend of @entity184 ' 18 - year - old sister , she said			0
the sister , @entity185 , a @entity26 college student visiting her parents ' home , was trapped for a few hours in the rubble			1
she passed out briefly during the collapse , and she awoke to " everybody screaming , " she said			0
" i heard footsteps overhead			1
people were walking on the bricks , " @entity185 , a student at @entity193 's @entity192 , said by phone from @entity8 on thursday			1
" i was crying and screaming for help			0
" people dug her out after she helped them find her			0
she found a piece of wood , stuck it between bricks and moved it until someone saw it , she said			0
impact your world @entity185 and her cousin were injured but are ok			0
also escaping the collapse were one of her sisters and another friend ; her parents were at work			0
@entity38 - @entity172 arrived in @entity2 in time for her grandfather 's funeral january 15			0
by thursday , many of the @entity12 ' patients had been sent to hospitals			0
only about 20 remained in the yard			0
@entity3 and @entity4 no longer tend to the patients during the day -- @entity3 was just named the country 's coordinator for disaster medical care , and @entity4 , who already worked for @entity2 's government , is helping determine which hospitals are running and where more can be set up , @entity19 said			1
some of the @entity26 nine went to work with @entity163 on thursday , helping to direct hospital workers to medical supplies , @entity38 - @entity172 said			1
though the nine plan to leave @entity2 this weekend , some may return soon			0
@entity185 said it was a relief to see the group			0
" it 's been hard for us here , and it feels good to know people are supporting us , " she said			0
" now our whole family is together			0
... they give us strength every day			0
" @entity0 's @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
