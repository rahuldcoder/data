-- chemical weapons engulf soldiers carrying 60 - pound rucksacks , their mud - filled boots trenching through a river dividing simulated enemy lines			1
troops run in the desert to acclimate to harsh conditions with winter temperatures as low as 8 degrees , summer as high as 120			2
the training becomes increasingly realistic in the weeks before deployment , mirroring the topography they may endure , but not necessarily the human terrain -- the cultures they 'll be dealing with			0
and in a foreign land , something as seemingly innocuous as a thumbs - up sign or shaking a woman 's hand can land a soldier in trouble			1
while physical conditioning and live - fire exercises certainly help prepare troops for deployment , they 're culturally blind if they do n't understand the people among whom they 'll be fighting			1
in the 21st century , when the @entity32 is at war with ideals as much as -- if not more than -- foreign armies , this blind side can be as dangerous as your @entity37 jamming			1
" this makes warfare a lot more complex			0
so we have to be much more expeditionary			0
we have to be more intelligence - minded , more people - minded			2
we have to understand the populations that we 're operating in and among , " said @entity45 , a former @entity46 director who runs the culture - training company , @entity47			2
the past decade has taught the @entity50 many lessons			0
according to gen. @entity51 , @entity50 chief of staff , the biggest takeaway from @entity53 and @entity54 is the importance of " understanding the prevailing culture and values			1
" to address tomorrow 's conflicts , @entity51 revealed an initiative in march 2012 to regionally align brigades with the six unified command zones			0
the plan aims to create brigades better equipped to operate in specific regions by establishing language and cultural proficiency programs in their assigned territory			0
currently , anthropology , language and 10,000 years of heritage are squeezed into troops ' curricula a few weeks before deployment , what @entity45 calls " cultural training on steroids			1
" between pre-deployment paperwork and drills , they are handed a small pamphlet outlining some history and cultural no - nos to avoid			2
former soldier @entity80 recalled there was sparse cultural training before his 2003 deployment to @entity53			1
" they gave us an @entity88 / @entity87 translation book , told us things not to say and do like give the ok sign , which is seen as an obscene gesture , and that was about it , " he said			0
as the @entity50 concludes its mission in @entity54 , top military leaders are not only looking back but also forward to what the 21st century holds as new threats arise			0
the enemy du jour is manifested in ethnicities spanning more than one country , yet adhering to the same ideals , making borders often meaningless			2
take @entity102 in @entity53 and @entity103 in @entity104 : the @entity106 groups may be on different continents , but they subscribe to similar ideals , inciting state - to - state rivalries			1
col. @entity110 said efforts to craft a more culturally savvy @entity50 is an effort to foster more symbiotic relationships across various regions			0
@entity115 is a commander with the @entity117 , @entity118 , aka " @entity120 , " which is the first force to be regionally aligned			2
@entity120 will provide @entity121 with defense guidance and security enhancement beginning march 2013			0
" by increasing their security and capabilities , it will prevent potential future threats to their countries as well as the @entity32 , " he said , adding that such proactive measures could actually make @entity32 deployments unnecessary in the future			1
the @entity136 - aligned armored brigade of 4,000 troops based out of @entity138 , @entity139 , will still maintain core combat skills , such as gunnery , live - fire training and medical training so it can respond to any mission globally , but the brigade will have a more tedious training regimen than the one - size - fits - all approach applied to current general forces			1
@entity136 hosts a multitude of customs			0
more than 2,000 languages ( and by some counts , as many as 3,000 ) are spoken on the continent			2
most @entity136 adhere to some brand of @entity154 or @entity155 , but there are also animist beliefs as well as ethnic and folk mythologies			0
you can also find a smattering of @entity162 and @entity163			0
to " put a sharper point on the pencil , " as @entity115 explains it , experts and advisers will school soldiers in demographics , religious breakdowns , dominant languages , political landscapes and general cultural understanding			1
watch @entity50 chaplain share thoughts on cultural mistakes in @entity54 their training can include lessons as disparate as proper social interactions and the kinds of weapons systems that a country 's basic security force might be equipped with , said lt. col. @entity186 , who helps plan the regionally aligned forces			2
for example , @entity155 in many countries forbids men from touching a woman who is n't a relative , and this includes shaking her hand , a common @entity32 greeting			1
former soldier @entity80 also said showing the soles of your feet is disrespectful in @entity53			1
in @entity201 , the thumbs - up sign is considered offensive			1
the training will be tailored to the needs and requests of nations hosting @entity32 troops , with the aim of " transferring knowledge to our counterparts to bring them to a proficiency level where they can help us in the future , " said col. @entity209 , commander of the @entity210 , which will help train @entity120 to become more culturally adept during its time in @entity136			1
the 162nd currently functions as a combat adviser for foreign security forces , responsible for training all @entity50 personnel deploying for the missions in @entity53 and @entity54			1
already , several @entity136 nations have requested 90 small - scale missions to familiarize their soldiers with weapons and basic rifle marksmanship			2
they 've also requested combined military exercises and that the @entity50 help them enhance live - fire capabilities , medical training and logistics , so @entity120 will focus on those requests , @entity228 said			1
" we also have 27 larger collective exercises which are developed to build the capacity of the regional peacekeeping brigades within @entity136 , " he said			0
but even before deploying , @entity120 is already encountering obstacles			0
with the @entity243 's 2013 fiscal budget slicing 80,000 troops over the next five years , the @entity50 is wrestling with the question : who 's going to pay for this ? " i think in the long term , though , the @entity50 sees this as a more efficient way to train the staff , " @entity45 said			2
@entity51 seems to agree , as he made the regional alignment a top pillar in his @entity50 2020 objectives aimed at making leaders more adaptive and equipment more modern			0
the wars in @entity53 and @entity54 demonstrated how cognizance of cultures , ethnicities and religions was essential to understanding the source of conflict , @entity110 said			1
@entity45 added that the training alone can help a soldier better understand the lay of any land			0
even if troops received cultural training specifically for @entity136 nations , it would be better to use that unit in the @entity273 than troops who were n't culturally aligned at all , he said			0
" anthropologically , socially , economically , they 'll have to reset what the answers are , but the right questions will already be in their mind , " he said .			0

the @entity32 is at war with ideals as much as or more than foreign armies
troops ' curricula to include demographics , religion , languages , political landscapes
thumbs - up in @entity201 , showing soles of feet in @entity53 are examples of offensive gestures
commander : increasing countries ' capabilities could prevent future @entity32 deployments
