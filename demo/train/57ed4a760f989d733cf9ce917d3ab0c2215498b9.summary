-- as fellow @entity2 officials met with allied and @entity5 counterparts in @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 said wednesday that all sides are closer than they 've been in a long time on a nuclear deal			1
but they stressed it has n't been reached yet			0
" it 's important to exhaust the remedies and possibilities of diplomacy , " @entity1 said from @entity11			1
" we have the best chance we 've had in a decade , we believe , to halt progress and roll back @entity5 's program			2
" the prospect of an agreement that could roll back some punitive measures against @entity5 in exchange for measures assuring that the @entity26 country is n't developing a nuclear weapon has met significant resistance			0
some in @entity29 have voiced opposition , saying leaders in @entity32 can not be trusted			0
it 's a sentiment echoed by @entity35 leaders			1
@entity1 insisted the continuing talks represent " the initial stage of determining whether or not there 's a first step that can be taken			1
" whether the ultimate result is @entity5 having access to peaceful nuclear energy is a long ways off ; for now , @entity1 claimed that a prospective deal would n't give that country leeway to move toward developing a nuclear weapon			1
@entity5 nuclear talks : 11 things you need to know " we will not allow this agreement should it be reached -- and i say , should it be reached -- to buy time or to allow for the acceptance of an agreement that does not properly address our core , fundamental concerns , " he said			0
@entity1 spoke as negotiators met in @entity6 , where the major players engaged in three days of intense talks earlier this month			1
those discussions concluded without the agreement some had anticipated , albeit with optimism that it could come soon			0
" i think we are all on the same wavelength , and that 's important , " @entity5 foreign minister @entity66 said then			1
" and that gives us the impetus to go forward			0
" like those discussions , the current talks involve delegations from @entity5 and the five permanent members of the @entity75 -- the @entity2 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 -- plus @entity80 in what is known as the @entity82			2
" the atmosphere is positive , " one senior @entity2 official said , adding that the @entity85 powers expressed condolences for a bombing that happened near the @entity88 in @entity89			0
" we are not in a rush , " the official said			0
" we want to get a good deal , the right deal			2
" @entity35 leader : ' this must be a genuine solution ' one sticking point has been @entity5 's insistence on enriching its own uranium for peaceful purposes			1
the @entity2 official said the issue " can be navigated in an agreement			0
" @entity2 national security adviser @entity102 said the plan would benefit the global community			0
" the international community would have unprecedented access to @entity5 's nuclear facilities and full transparency into what they 're doing , so they would n't have the ability to sneak out or break out , " @entity105 said			2
but @entity35 , the @entity2 ' closest ally in the region , staunchly opposes the tentative plan			1
" it 's a bad deal -- an exceedingly bad deal , " @entity35 prime minister @entity116 told @entity0 this week			1
@entity116 opposes lifting some sanctions now without getting further concessions to ensure @entity5 would be unable to continue with uranium enrichment and other steps			1
" i think you should not only keep up the pressure ; i think you should increase the pressure , because it 's finally working , " @entity116 said , labeling @entity5 's economy as close to paralysis			1
" if you give it up now , when you have that pressure , and @entity5 does n't even take apart , dismantle one centrifuge , what leverage will you have when you 've eased the pressure ? " at the same time , @entity116 repeated his insistence that @entity35 " always reserves the right to defend itself against any threat , " which is diplomat - speak for a military strike on @entity5 's nuclear facilities to stop the development of a weapon			1
@entity116 elaborated wednesday during remarks in @entity142 , where he met with @entity76 president @entity143			1
he characterized @entity5 's development of nuclear weapons " the biggest threat against us and against global security			2
" carrying through on @entity75 resolutions like those " to halt all enrichment , to remove all enriched material ( and ) to dismantle the centrifuges " are central to that goal			0
" i would like remove any doubts : we want a peaceful , diplomatic solution ; everyone prefers this over any other solution , " @entity116 added			1
" but this must be a genuine solution			2
" @entity5 : some @entity35 officials ' are like animals ' the supreme leader of iran , ayatollah @entity164 , did n't mince words when he fired back at @entity35 , his nation 's staunch adversary			1
" @entity35 officials can not be even called humans			2
they are like animals , some of them , " he said wednesday			0
the ayatollah also said @entity5 's " heroic flexibility " is not a violation of @entity5 's values			2
he coined that term a few months ago to explain that @entity5 's leadership can be flexible while remaining " heroic " in the face of western powers it still does n't trust			2
in remarks wednesday , @entity5 president @entity184 said his country is looking for an agreement that will benefit both sides			2
" the @entity191 of @entity5 is looking for stability and tranquility in the entire region , and success in our negotiations with the @entity198 will benefit all the regional countries and the world , " he said , according to the semiofficial @entity190 news agency			0
tuesday 's twin suicide bombing near the @entity88 in @entity203 's capital will not sway the talks , @entity184 said			0
" those who think they can achieve their goals through terror , intimidation and violence have always been in mistake , and they are erring again this time , " he said			0
rifts within the @entity2 some @entity2 lawmakers are n't sold on the new plan			0
on tuesday , a bipartisan group of six senators urged the administration to reject the proposed deal with @entity5 and accept only an agreement that better dismantles @entity5 's ability to develop nuclear weapons			1
" i think all of us are concerned , " said sen. @entity223 , @entity224			0
" we know who we are dealing with , and we 've watched this same type of activity occur in @entity229 , where you began to alleviate sanctions , and i think what the concern is that whatever you do in the interim basis becomes the new norm			0
" but @entity2 president @entity238 said the current sanctions put in place during his administration had forced @entity5 to the negotiating table because of economic contraction and frozen oil revenue			0
he said the proposed deal would " open up the spigot a little bit " on some of the frozen revenue while leaving in place the bulk of the most effective sanctions involving @entity5 oil exports and banking			0
but @entity238 also stressed that all options , including military strikes on @entity5 's nuclear facilities , remained on the table as far as the @entity2 was concerned			0
vice president @entity257 , joined by members of his national security team , explained the administration 's position wednesday to 12 @entity263 senators			1
he laid out potential parameters of a six - month deal such as addressing ' @entity5 's enrichment capabilities , existing stockpiles of uranium , centrifuges and ability to produce plutonium using the @entity273 reactor " and allowing for " intrusive monitoring " by international inspectors			1
" the vice president reiterated that the president has a responsibility to seek a peaceful resolution that prevents @entity5 from obtaining a nuclear weapon before pursuing alternatives , " the @entity276 said in a statement			1
" the current p5 +1 proposal has the potential to do just that			0
" why @entity35 , @entity288 states are wary of @entity5 nuclear talks @entity2 - @entity35 rift over @entity5 nukes now in the open @entity0 's @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			1
