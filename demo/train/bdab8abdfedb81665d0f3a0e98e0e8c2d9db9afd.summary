a new law in @entity1 makes it a sex crime to post sexual pictures or videos to the internet without the consent of the person featured in them			2
we need to follow that example			2
revenge porn can ruin a person 's life			1
a single post can go viral			2
for example , in the @entity15 , " @entity23 " allowed her ex-boyfriend to take her naked photograph because , he assured her , it would be for his eyes only			2
after their breakup , the man betrayed her trust			0
on the revenge porn site @entity29 , he uploaded her naked photo and contact information			1
@entity23 received calls , e-mails , and @entity35 friend requests from hundreds of strangers , many of whom wanted sex			0
after the site refused to take down the post and the anonymous calls and e-mails intensified , she turned to law enforcement			2
according to the officers , nothing could be done because her ex had not engaged in a harassing " course of conduct , " as required by criminal harassment law , and because he had not explicitly solicited others to stalk her			0
criminal law should have a role in deterring and punishing revenge porn			1
it 's not new that certain types of privacy invasions are crimes			0
many states prohibit the nonconsensual taking of sexually explicit images -- the disclosure of someone 's naked images should be criminalized as well			1
only @entity65 and @entity66 have laws against turning people into objects of pornography without their permission -- although a huge loophole in @entity65 allows the posting of " selfie " images and only applies to photos posted by the photographer			1
revenge porn and its ilk raise the risk of offline stalking and physical attack			1
victims do n't feel safe leaving their homes			0
@entity23 , who is a nurse , did not go to work for days			0
as many victims have told me , they struggle especially with anxiety , and some suffer panic attacks			0
revenge porn victims withdraw from online engagement , shutting down their social media profiles and blogs to prevent strangers from finding them online			1
they can not participate fully in our networked age			0
the professional costs of revenge porn are steep			1
because searches of victims ' names display their naked images , they lose their jobs			1
schools have fired teachers whose naked photos appeared on revenge porn sites			1
a government agency terminated a woman 's employment after a co-worker circulated her nude photograph to colleagues			2
victims may be unable to find work at all			0
according to a 2009 @entity121 study , more than 80 % of employers rely on candidates ' online reputations as an employment screen			0
common reasons for not interviewing and hiring applicants include concerns about their " lifestyle , " " inappropriate " online comments , and " unsuitable " photographs , videos , and information about them			0
recruiters do n't contact victims to see if they posted nude photos of themselves or if someone else did in violation of their trust			1
the simple but regrettable truth is that after consulting search results , employers do n't call revenge porn victims to schedule an interview or to extend offers			1
it 's just seen as good business to avoid hiring people whose search results would reflect poorly on them			0
revenge porn is a harmful form of bigotry and sexual harassment			1
it exposes victims ' sexuality in humiliating ways			0
their naked photos appear on slut shaming sites			1
once their naked images are exposed , anonymous strangers send e-mail messages that threaten rape			1
some have said : " first i will rape you , then i 'll kill you			0
" victims internalize these frightening and demeaning messages			0
@entity66 is the only state to make it a felony to disclose a person 's nude or partially nude images without that person 's consent			2
in @entity65 , it 's a misdemeanor			0
the @entity66 statute is a helpful model for states that are considering proposals to criminalize revenge porn			1
@entity180 should amend the federal cyberstalking law , 18 @entity182 , to cover the use of any interactive computer service to produce or disclose a sexually graphic visual depiction of an individual without that individual 's consent			0
what about @entity191 objections to legislative proposals to criminalize revenge porn ? a narrowly crafted criminal statute like @entity66 's can be reconciled with our commitment to free speech			1
@entity191 protections are less rigorous for purely private matters because the threat of liability would not risk chilling the meaningful exchange of ideas			0
listeners and speakers have no legitimate interest in nude photos or sex tapes published without the subjects ' permission			1
that online users can claim a prurient interest in viewing sexual images does not transform them into a matter of legitimate public concern			2
@entity216 pornography lacks @entity191 value as a historical matter , and could be understood as categorically unprotected as obscenity			2
although the @entity222 's obscenity doctrine has developed along different lines with distinct justifications , nonconsensual pornography can be seen as part of obscenity 's long tradition of proscription			0
criminalizing revenge porn is a crucial step in protecting victims from real and profound harms to their physical , emotional , and financial health and safety			1
it would deter damaging privacy invasions and send the powerful message that posting someone 's most private moments , most often in a breach of their trust and without their permission , is unacceptable			2
that lesson needs to be repeated early and often before online users , especially young people , think that shaming and terrorizing individuals is an acceptable practice			0
we need a " cyber civil rights " agenda to combat bigoted online abuse			0
the criminalization of nonconsensual disclosure of someone 's naked images is an important part of that agenda .			1
