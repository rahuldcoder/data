-- it 's hard to believe it 's been 30 years since @entity3 and @entity4 took a ride across the moon			1
as @entity10 , who played @entity4 in the movie " @entity3 , " said , " ironically enough , even with today 's technology and knowledge of movie magic , people still ask me how they made the bike fly			1
they used a blue screen and rear projection			0
it 's an old trick			0
" @entity20 's " @entity3 " was the biggest blockbuster of 1982 , winning four @entity19			1
it remains the fourth most - successful movie of all time in the @entity23 " @entity3 " even surpassed " @entity28 " as the highest - grossing film of all time and was n't beat until another @entity20 film came along : 1993 's " @entity27			1
" one of the reasons " @entity3 " remains timeless is because it was n't supposed to be an effects - heavy film			1
memorable visuals , like the bicycle scene , were seamlessly woven in			0
@entity20 did n't want audiences " ooohing " and " aaahing " over special effects			1
he simply wanted it to look like he 'd shot a perfect night moon , because he did just that			0
that was the real moon			0
the visual effects team spent several nights charting the moon and scouting locations for the perfect spot in the forest at the perfect time			0
@entity10 , who was 10 years old when he made " @entity3 , " said he 'll never forget the distinct smell of the @entity50 soundstage			1
" @entity51 have a very particular smell , " he explained , " and to this day whenever i have that , it takes me back to those days , because those are pretty much the first memories i have of working on a set			0
" @entity10 , now 41 , described the smell as " a combination of new lumber , cigarette smoke and fog machines			2
they used a lot of atmospheric fog			0
" he also recalled eating @entity64 by the fistful			0
in the film , @entity4 lures @entity3 into his house by leaving a trail of the candy			2
" i made myself sick from eating them because we always had those 2 - pound bags lying around , " @entity10 said			1
" they were set dressing in @entity4 's room , so in between takes , i was constantly eating those things			0
in fact , when i saw @entity20 -- we did an interview together earlier this year -- and when i saw him , i said something about how i ate too many of those things , and he said , ' oh , yeah , i know you did			1
you were eating those way too much			0
' " producers originally wanted to use @entity83 , but parent company @entity84 passed			0
on a more sentimental note , @entity10 believes that the reason " @entity3 " still resonates with audiences today is because " people respond to the message of compassion and friendship			1
it 's a simple , very human thing			2
" actress @entity93 , who played @entity4 's mother , @entity94 , said , " it 's our ' @entity96 , ' and it 's something that every generation wants to pass down to the next generation and share with it and tell the stories about			0
" @entity103 said she believes " @entity3 " remains a global cultural phenomenon because " it 's all about love and keeping your heart open			1
and when you do that , even the little alien from outer space can be your best friend			0
" in a recent interview featured on the new 30th anniversary " @entity3 " blu - ray / dvd , @entity20 said that the idea for " @entity3 " came to him when he was directing 1977 's " @entity119			1
" he thought of doing a scenario where the alien did n't return to the mothership			0
he 'd also wanted to make a film exploring how divorce impacts pre-teens			0
( the director himself endured his own parents ' divorce when he was 15			0
) so in collaboration with screenwriter @entity131 , @entity20 combined those two ideas to create " @entity3 's " sweet story about a lonesome boy rescued -- by an alien -- from the sadness of his parents ' divorce			1
referring to " @entity3 " as " the most personal thing i 'd done as a director , " @entity20 stated that his intention all along was to tell the tale from the kids ' points of view			1
except for @entity103 's character , " all the other adults are either silhouetted , shot at a long distance or from the waist down , " said @entity20 , " until the critical moment where @entity3 is dying , and then for the first time , we see the character of @entity152			1
" @entity20 also noted that working with @entity10 , a then - 6 - year - old @entity153 ( @entity154 ) and 15 - year - old @entity155 ( @entity156 ) made him want to be a father			1
the director recalled viewing a number of early concept sketches before committing to @entity3 's look			2
he was adamant that the little alien not resemble a monster			0
interestingly enough , the director envisioned a combination of @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , because he wanted @entity3 's oversized eyes to look " as wizened and as sad as those icons			2
" @entity3 began shooting in september 1981 and wrapped that december			0
it was filmed under the code name " @entity3 " because @entity20 feared plagiarism of the plot			1
actors were instructed to read the script behind closed doors ; everyone on - set had to wear an id card			0
most of @entity3 's voice work was performed by an elderly woman named @entity181 , whose two - pack a day smoking habit gave her voice the deep quality @entity20 had envisioned			1
however , there were 18 contributors to @entity3 's voice in total			2
to create sounds ranging from @entity3 talking and breathing to snorting and drunkenly burping , the contributors included @entity20 himself , sound effects creator @entity190 's sleeping wife who had a cold , a burp from a @entity194 film professor , raccoons , sea otters , horses and actress @entity199 's signature husky voice			1
( you ca n't make this stuff up			0
) @entity199 also has a cameo in " @entity3 " during the trick - or - treating scene			2
she 's dressed as a doctor wearing a monster mask carrying a poodle in a clown costume			0
( you really ca n't make this stuff up			0
) @entity20 gave @entity199 the " @entity3 " script and had her record every single one of @entity3 's lines into a tape recorder			1
in the scene where government agents have taken over @entity4 's home , real doctors from @entity216 were recruited to play the doctors who try to save @entity3 , because @entity20 felt that actors talking about technical medical matters did n't seem natural			1
in addition , @entity20 cut a scene featuring @entity225 as the headmaster at @entity4 's school			2
@entity20 recalled receiving " stacks " of congratulatory telegrams upon " @entity3 's " premiere during the @entity229 in june 1982 , but the most treasured one came from @entity233 , who said , " you belong here more than me			1
" at a @entity237 screening , @entity20 sat next to president @entity238 and noted that " the president 's face became very childlike			2
his mouth was open , his eyes were wide , and i suddenly saw a 10 - year - old boy			2
" @entity10 added that he is " pleasantly surprised " by the film 's resonating success			2
" i never really thought when we were filming that it would ever be a success			0
it literally took until about 10 years ago for me to realize , ' wow ! this " @entity3 " thing is n't going away			1

@entity20 's " @entity3 " is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year
it remains the fourth most - successful movie of all time in the @entity23
the 30th anniversary dvd / @entity258 includes an interview with @entity20
