@entity0 has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts			1

voters backed parties on the far left and right , withholding support from @entity10 and @entity13 , the more moderate parties that made up the coalition that enacted austerity measures			1

there is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize @entity0 's bailout agreement with the @entity65 and @entity66			1
that could lead to a disorderly default by @entity0 , which would force the nation out of the eurozone			1
a default by @entity0 also could drag down other troubled governments such as @entity73 and @entity74			2

@entity89 's president - elect , @entity88 , campaigned against austerity and has promised to push through measures to boost economic growth			0
@entity9 said sunday 's fragmented results in the @entity0 election show voters do n't trust " any party on its own			1
" but he has said he wants @entity0 to stay in the eurozone			2
@entity11 said his @entity13 would be willing to participate in a national unity government " provided it ensures @entity0 's stay in the euro " and a revision of the bailout agreements with the country 's foreign lenders			1
earlier , @entity11 said it will be tough to form a " viable government , " but he said , " there is still hope			2
" speaking to other members of parliament earlier , @entity11 accused the leftist @entity17 party , which placed second in the elections , of " populism " and a desire to take the country to new elections			1
@entity11 said any new elections would mark a battle " between the pro-european parties and the anti-european left			0
" @entity15 said @entity0 is no longer bound by austerity promises made in return for rescue loans			2
@entity15 has also demanded an examination of @entity0 's massive debt and a moratorium on part of its repayment			2
@entity15 said @entity9 wants a government participating in the policy of the bailout			0
but @entity15 said " the refusal to take part is not given by @entity17 but by the @entity0 people			1
" " @entity9 and @entity11 are sticking to the points that they signed in the bailout , " @entity15 said after meeting with @entity9			0
" they want a pro-bailout government with a left alibi			0
" " no government has the right to stick to the measures of the bailout , " @entity15 said			0
an opinion poll thursday shows that @entity17 would come in first if fresh elections were held , with nearly 28 % of the vote , much higher than the 16.8 % that landed the party into second place during this week 's elections			1
@entity10 and @entity13 , the two parties that have been dominating political life in @entity0 for decades , have seen their popularity plummet as a result of the two bailouts and the austerity measures dictated in the programs			1
the poll shows that if elections were held @entity13 would slightly increase its position to 20.3 % , while @entity160 's popularity would suffer an even steeper decline to 12.6 %			1
last year , @entity0 's debt threatened to force it to drop @entity58 's common currency , the euro , prompting the @entity165 and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding			2
in exchange , they demanded that the government slash spending			0
the resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs , wages , pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry			0
the national unemployment rate for january , the latest month for which figures are available , was nearly 22 % , prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work			0
youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work			0
for two years , the country 's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the eurozone			0
@entity0 pushed through a huge debt swap in march to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the @entity65 , the @entity165 and the @entity66 , worth â ‚ ¬ 130 billion ( $ 171.5 billion )			2
the debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc , where fears that @entity0 might collapse had increased pressure on other debt - laden nations such as @entity73 and @entity208 .			2
