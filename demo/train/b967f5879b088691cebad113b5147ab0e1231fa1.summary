-- federal officials announced indictments tuesday against four police officers and two supervisors in the investigation surrounding the @entity7 deaths of civilians on @entity10 ' @entity9			1
at least three @entity10 police officers were in @entity13 custody tuesday afternoon , an attorney for one of them confirmed			1
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity16 surrendered to authorities			0
announcement of the charges stemming from a federal civil rights investigation was made by attorney general @entity21 in @entity10			1
" put simply , we will not tolerate wrongdoing by those who have sworn to protect the public , " @entity21 told reporters			0
@entity21 promised the @entity27 will help restore the troubled @entity10 police department			1
" today marks an important step forward in administering justice , in healing community wounds , in improving public safety and in restoring public trust in this city 's police department , " @entity21 said			1
he was joined by the @entity27 's civil rights chief , @entity37 , and @entity39 attorney @entity38 , the top federal prosecutor in @entity10			0
the shootings occurred at the bridge on september 4 , 2005 , six days after @entity42 slammed into the @entity43			1
the indictment allegesthat two separate shootings at the bridge resulted in the deaths of a teenager and a 40 - year - old disabled man			1
the indictment contends four officers -- @entity15 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- opened fire , killing 19 - year - old @entity55			1
minutes later , @entity52 allegedly shot and killed 40 - year - old @entity56			1
the indictment says the officers violated the victims ' civil rights			1
the indictment says police supervisors @entity61 and @entity63 helped the other officers to obstruct justice during the subsequent investigations			1
an earlier investigation launched by the local district attorney resulted in charges but no convictions			1
federal prosecutors then moved in and launched a new investigation which led to the newly announced charges			1
@entity38 said the federal case took so long because prosecutors waited for the local investigation to conclude , so as not to interfere or duplicate that probe			0
although the charges announced tuesday carry a maximum sentence of the death penalty , @entity38 played down that likelihood , saying an extended process will eventually be followed and any final decision on seeking the death penalty would be made by @entity21			2
attorney @entity85 , who represents @entity15 , said of the indictment , " we expected it and are ready to deal with it			0
" the two shootings occurred on opposite sides of the bridge			2
in the first shooting , on the east side of the bridge , one person -- later identified as @entity55 -- was killed and four people were wounded , prosecutors have said			0
in the second shooting , on the bridge 's west side , @entity99 , a severely disabled man , was killed			0
@entity56 's brother was arrested but later released without indictment , authorities said			0
a witness to the shooting of @entity99 told @entity0 in 2006 that @entity10 police lined up " like at a firing range " and fatally shot the man in the back as he fled from them in the days after @entity42 swept ashore			2
" he just fell like he was collapsing , " @entity114 told @entity0			0
" like something just wiped him out			0
" @entity114 was one of many flood refugees living on the second floor of the @entity118 , a low - income motel on the city 's east side			2
he said on sunday , september 4 , 2005 , he woke up and stepped onto the balcony of the motel and saw a man running , hands outstretched and being fired upon			2
initial police accounts said that @entity99 , 40 , reached for his waistband and turned on police , but @entity114 said @entity99 did not appear to have a weapon and that he was running away from police " hands out , full speed " when he was shot			2
police declined @entity0 's request for an interview in response to @entity114 's remarks			2
after the shooting , police said officers had responded to reported gunshots on the @entity9 and that a running gunbattle ensued with six suspects			1
a police department press release from october 4 , 2005 , said @entity56 , described as an unidentified gunman , was " confronted by a @entity10 police officer			2
the suspect reached into his waist and turned toward the officer who fired one shot , fatally wounding him			0
" when asked if @entity99 had a gun , @entity114 said , " i did n't see any on him			0
" no gun was found on @entity99 's body			0
an autopsy report obtained previously by @entity0 and verified by the @entity155 said @entity56 suffered five gunshot wounds to his back and two in his shoulder			0
