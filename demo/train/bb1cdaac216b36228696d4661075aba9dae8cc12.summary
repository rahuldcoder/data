-- @entity1 catapulted to fame as the punishing trainer who got results on " @entity5 " and " losing it with @entity1			1
" but the 38 - year - old has always been just as interested in building confidence as she has in sculpting rockhard abs. it 's no accident that her most recent book is " unlimited : how to build an @entity13			1
" @entity1 tackles -- including her recent gig as life adviser on " the doctors , " her dvds ( such as her latest , " @entity18 " ) , and her intimate podcast -- is meant to help the rest of us claim a healthier , happier life			1
sitting high in the hills of @entity24 , the woman who calls everybody " buddy " is surprisingly funny and self - deprecating			1
and , as expected , she 's incredibly open , talking about her tough tween years , how she stays motivated ( and how you can , too ) , and the dream she 's fighting to make a reality			1
do you see yourself as more of a life coach than a fitness trainer ? for years , i always thought it was hilarious that i was this fitness guru , because fitness was just a tool i utilized to help people improve their confidence			1
for me , it 's never been about fitness			1
it 's always been about helping to empower people			1
@entity0 : get the body you crave with celeb - inspired workouts what is the connection between physical fitness and self - confidence ? i 've always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier , healthier life			1
when your health is strong , you 're capable of taking risks			1
you 'll feel more confident to ask for the promotion			2
you 'll have more energy to be a better mom			2
you 'll feel more deserving of love			2
what inspires you to take care of your own body ? that comes from me			2
you can look for external sources of motivation and that can catalyze a change , but it wo n't sustain one			2
it has to be from an internal desire			2
you have to ask , " why do i want this ? " i want to be around for a family , and to feel good about my body			2
i want to set an example			2
my number - one piece of advice is : look inside and find out what your " why " is			2
i do n't care whose butt you 've posted on the screen of your treadmill			2
did you ever post a butt on the treadmill ? i always thought @entity91 was awesome , and i still do			2
i remember @entity92 in " terminator 2 , " and just thinking , really ? that scene opens up and she 's just banging out pull - ups , and i remember thinking , that 's awesome			1
what other tips do you have for staying motivated ? when it comes to your " why , " write it down and put it everywhere -- in your car , on your phone			2
remind yourself constantly why you 're doing what you 're doing			2
then remove any sort of temptation			2
build a support system , whether it 's a workout buddy or a mom from day care , so you have that person to call when you have a moment of weakness			1
@entity0 : @entity1 ' tips for sticking with a workout can anyone get motivated ? are there impossible cases ? @entity116 does n't exist			1
lazy is a symptom of something else			0
the person who ca n't get up off their butt is just a person who 's depressed			1
it 's usually a pervasive lack of self - worth , or a feeling of helplessness			1
that 's why fitness is so important			1
you have the ability to show somebody what she 's capable of very quickly			1
as we get older , is time working against us ? i really do n't believe that			0
i 've worked with people in their 50s and 60s , and i 've had a very easy time taking weight off them			1
if you 've been living in an unhealthy way , you might have been getting away with it for 10 or 15 years , but [ you 'll see ] the cumulative effects of toxic living			0
it 's not because you 're old			1
if you leave a car out in the rain , it 's going to rust eventually			1
it 's a matter of , what are you eating ? how are you living ? there 's no such thing as not being able to turn back the clock			1
it 's never too late			1
you just have to change the way you live			0
what else will keep our bodies young ? @entity160 , sleep ! i really do prioritize my sleep -- i get seven to eight hours a night			0
sleep , have sex ( it 's really good for your health ) , and eat organic whenever you possibly can			1
@entity0 : surprising health benefits of sleep do you ever watch yourself on tv ? i find television to be a bit like a meat grinder			0
it 's like , you have a cow , you put it through a meat grinder , and out comes a hot dog			1
on " loser , " i was a cartoon character			0
and i actually feel like " the doctors " made a real effort to tone me down			0
so who is the real @entity1 ? i 'm part @entity184 , part @entity186			1
i 'm shy ; i 'm prude			0
you are ? i am so prude			0
we did n't talk about that when i grew up			0
but on my podcast you see the sense of humor , the vulnerability , the passion			0
we talk about weight loss , bullying -- because i was bullied			0
when were you bullied ? it did n't get really bad until i was in junior high			0
i was an overweight kid , and i went through a period where , oh my @entity160 , they were making cow sounds at me when i walked down the hallway and just humiliating me			0
my mom pulled me out of one school and put me in another , but when you wear that stigma , you start to believe it			0
when you wear that energy , other kids smell it like blood in the water			0
that 's when i got into martial arts			1
i had a second - degree - blue - belt test , and i broke two boards with my right foot , and the next day i walked into school and no one ever picked on me again			0
i suddenly believed in myself and respected myself			0
i had some inkling of my power , so the bullying stopped instantly			0
@entity0 : are depressed kids bully magnets ? you 've spoken about your struggle to adopt a child			0
is there any news ? oh , @entity160 , nothing has been this hard in my entire life			1
it 's very complicated and it 's very time - consuming and i 'm committed to the process , but two years later , no update			1
theoretically , i 've been matched with a child			0
now i 'm just trying to get her home			0
how do you decompress ? yoga			0
i 've been doing a lot of it			0
it takes me out of my own mind ; i have to be present and think about my form			0
i find it very calming and grounding ; it makes me happy			0
know what i mean , buddy ? @entity255 2011			0
