@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 presidential hopefuls headed into the homestretch of the critical @entity1 primary campaign friday after a riveting debate that analysts believe gave @entity9 a boost over fellow front - runner @entity11			1
@entity1 voters will decide tuesday who gets the biggest delegate haul so far of the @entity4 presidential race , and the @entity2 / @entity4 of @entity1 debate provided the four candidates with their final chance to face one another on the same stage in the increasingly vitriolic contest			1
@entity9 and @entity22 entered thursday 's debate in a statistical dead - heat for the lead , according to recent polling , with former @entity28 sen. @entity27 and @entity30 rep. @entity29 trailing well back			1
@entity29 , who concedes he has no chance of victory in @entity1 's winner - take - all primary , heads to more moderate @entity34 on friday to campaign for the caucus that begins february 4 , while @entity9 , @entity22 and @entity27 all planned events in @entity1 to begin their final push for tuesday 's primary			1
needing a strong showing to try to blunt @entity22 's harsh attacks of recent days , @entity9 was forceful and had the former @entity42 speaker on his heels on some issues			1
at the same time , @entity27 had his strongest debate performance so far , coming across as a sincere and committed candidate who would best represent conservative principles			1
" @entity9 won two ways tonight , " said @entity2 contributor and @entity4 strategist @entity48			2
" one , by having a good debate and two by having @entity27 have his best debate yet			1
" @entity9 appeals to the more moderate wing of the @entity4 while @entity27 and @entity22 are competing for the conservative vote			1
if @entity27 can build support , it would hurt @entity22 as the primary process continues			2
@entity29 also had a good night , repeatedly prompting laughter and applause with self - deprecating one - liners and clear messaging about his libertarian policies that excite young supporters			2
the focus , though , was on the two leaders			0
@entity9 , the former @entity67 governor , provided his most forceful and unapologetic statement so far about his vast personal wealth , saying @entity4 such as @entity22 should n't criticize him for being successful			1
@entity9 released his tax returns this week under pressure from @entity22 and others , revealing he paid a rate of less than 15 % on income in the millions , mostly from investments including some holdings in offshore accounts			2
@entity22 had disparaged @entity9 's wealth on the campaign trail , saying he lived in a world of " @entity82 bank and @entity84 bank accounts " and did nothing for his money			1
@entity9 previously seemed uncomfortable discussing his finances , initially stalling on releasing his tax records , but he was ready thursday			2
" i think it 's important for people to make sure we do n't castigate individuals who have been successful and try to suggest there 's something wrong with being successful and having investments and having a return on those , " @entity9 said			2
addressing @entity22 directly , he said : " you indicated that somehow i did n't earn that money			0
" " i have earned the money that i have , " @entity9 continued			2
" i did n't inherit it			0
those investments lead to jobs being created in @entity104			2
i 'm proud of being successful			0
i 'm proud of being in the free enterprise system			0
i 'm not going to run away from that			0
" on the tax rate issue , @entity9 noted that combining taxes paid and charitable contributions equaled about 40 % of his income , and added to applause : " let 's put behind this idea of attacking me because of my money and lets get @entity4 to say , you know what , what you 've accomplished in your life should n't be seen as a detriment but an asset to help @entity104			1
" other exchanges were just as compelling			0
asked to address the housing crisis , one of the major problems facing @entity1 voters , @entity22 began by claiming that @entity9 was knowingly and " unfairly " attacking him on his consulting record for mortgage giant @entity128 , sparking a fiery back - and - forth over which candidate has had a closer relationship with troubled lenders			1
@entity22 claimed @entity9 had profited off of investments in both @entity134 and @entity128 in turn , @entity9 explained his holdings were in a blind trust and involved mutual funds that included bonds of the mortgage lenders			2
then he turned the tables on @entity22 , pointing out that @entity22 also had similar investments involving @entity134 and @entity128 , which prompted a crowd response			0
@entity2 senior political analyst @entity144 gave that round to @entity9 , saying @entity22 threw a punch and @entity9 " came back and caught him unexpected			0
" trying to widen what was becoming a two - man debate , moderator @entity148 asked @entity27 and @entity29 if they believed any profits earned from investing in the government - backed entities should be returned			1
" that subject does n't really interest me , " @entity29 replied to laughter , while @entity27 sounded exasperated in calling for a halt to what he labeled " petty personal politics " that distracted from more important issues			1
" can we set aside that @entity11 was a member of @entity162 and used the skills that he developed as a member of @entity162 to go out and advise companies -- and that 's not the worst thing in the world -- and that @entity9 is a wealthy guy because he worked hard and he 's going out and working hard ? " @entity27 said			1
later , though , @entity27 launched the toughest attack of the night on @entity9 in an extended back - and - forth over the health care plan @entity9 got passed in @entity67 that in some ways served as model for the federal health care reform under the @entity175 administration			1
positioning himself as the strongest opponent of the health care law , @entity27 insisted both the @entity9 plan and the federal plan included a mandate to own health insurance or face a fine -- a concept detested by conservatives			1
he repeatedly returned to that point when @entity9 tried to argue the difference between a state plan for @entity67 and a federal plan for the entire country , saying at one point : " your mandate is no different than @entity175 's mandate			1
" throughout the debate , the audience was more vocal than during the previous @entity1 debate on monday , when attendees were asked to hold their applause			1
@entity22 complained after the monday debate against denying spectators the right to express themselves			0
also in contrast to monday was @entity9 's approach , standing casually with a hand in his pocket for most of the two hours while responding with force to @entity22 salvos			0
afterward , @entity9 pronounced himself delighted with the debate , saying he thought it would give him a boost			1
" when i 'm shot at i 'll return fire , " he said			0
" i 'm no shrinking violet			0
" early in the evening , @entity9 drew frequent applause when he pushed back attacks by @entity22 over immigration			1
@entity22 called @entity9 the most anti-immigrant candidate on the debate stage , repeating a charge in a campaign ad @entity22 eventually pulled after a complaint it was unfair by @entity223 sen. @entity223			2
@entity9 responded with outrage , accusing @entity22 of using " highly - charged epithets " irresponsibly and denying he wants to deport all of the nation 's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants			2
however , @entity22 and @entity27 also agreed with @entity9 that at least some illegal immigrants would be likely to " self - deport " if the government were to crack down on employers who hired illegal immigrants			1
all three men advocated a system of identification for immigrants that would help employers verify an employee 's legal status			0
before the debate , @entity22 told an audience on @entity1 's @entity243 , hit hard by the end of the space shuttle program , that he would build a colony on the moon by the end of his second term in office -- a plan that found little support among his rivals on stage			1
@entity27 said the nation 's debt crisis was too severe to consider such proposals , while @entity9 called the idea deeply flawed			1
citing his business experience , @entity9 said that if an executive had come to him suggesting spending " billions " of dollars on a colony on the moon , " i 'd say ' you 're fired			2
' " earlier in the day , @entity22 lashed out at @entity9 , accusing him of engaging in sleazy negative politics and being part of a fragile establishment desperate to stop the former @entity42 speaker from winning the @entity4 nomination			0
one of @entity9 's most prominent supporters , former @entity4 presidential nominee @entity271 , released a statement through the @entity9 campaign that characterized @entity22 as erratic , unreliable and certain to lead the @entity4 to defeat in november			0
when @entity22 was in @entity162 , he " was a one - man - band who rarely took advice			0
it was his way or the highway , " said @entity271 , a former @entity104 senator from @entity277			0
as speaker , @entity22 " had a new idea every minute and most of them were off the wall			0
... democrats are spending millions of dollars running negative ads against @entity9 as they are hoping that @entity22 will be the nominee			0
" according to a @entity2 / @entity290 survey released wednesday , 36 % of people likely to vote in tuesday 's primary say they are backing @entity9 , with 34 % supporting @entity22			0
@entity9 's margin over @entity22 is well within the survey 's sampling error			0
@entity27 was at 11 % and @entity29 at 9 % , with 7 % undecided			0
@entity22 received a boost in the polls after his double - digit victory in saturday 's @entity298 primary , but wednesday 's @entity2 poll and another by the @entity300 indicate that his momentum might be waning			0
@entity2 's @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 contributed to this report			0

@entity9 forcefully defends his personal wealth as good for @entity104
@entity27 attacks @entity9 on his @entity67 health care reform plan
