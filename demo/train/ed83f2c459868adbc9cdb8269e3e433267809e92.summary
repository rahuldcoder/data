" watching a polar bear walk across the ice to your yacht			0
or sailing past a three - mile - wide iceberg in @entity42 -- now those are once - in - a - lifetime experiences , " says the chief officer of @entity37 , a company offering luxury journeys to destinations that time forgot			1

the @entity49 , @entity51 's volcanic islands , and @entity53 's river wilderness , to name just a few			1
and at up to $ 400,000 a week to charter one of @entity57 ' opulent boats equipped to handle these extreme locations , you will need deep pockets for these journeys			1
enriching escapes " what we 're really seeing is a trend for a lot more experiential travel -- people that want to do more , see more , learn more , and come away with an enriching experience , " says @entity26			1
" i think too many people are tired of having these incredible yachts and sitting in @entity25 surrounded by all these other yachts			0
why would you do that , when you can actually be out there exploring on your own ? " for the wealthy holiday - maker accustomed to the most exclusive surroundings money can buy , these difficult - to - reach destinations offer the ultimate in elite escapism			1
often the affluent adventurers must take a private jet simply to reach far - flung locations			1
once on board , they can take a personal submarine out for underwater exploration -- " they 're essential toys on superyachts , " explains @entity26			0
of course , that 's if they 're not wandering among hundreds of thousands of emperor penguins in @entity42 , or watching traditional fire dancing by indigenous @entity92 tribes			1

they are awe - inspiring , " says @entity26			1
" for me , @entity42 is the most incredible spot on @entity21			1
more than any other destination , it leaves people fundamentally changed			0
" for the @entity102 of high society , these exotic journeys are also the ultimate dinner party conversation among guests who may have spent their summers moored in @entity25			2
creature comforts unlike 20th - century polar explorer @entity110 , who was forced to endure frostbite , today 's wealthy adventurers do n't have to compromise on comfort on their adventures			2
those choosing not take their own superyacht on the journey of a lifetime , can charter one of @entity57 ' luxury liners -- including a recently - converted , 71 - meter @entity122 patrol vessel			1
" @entity128 " has been fully kitted out with opulent extras , including a gym and sauna -- hardly the @entity110 idea of " roughing it			0
" " with this sort of yacht you can do in one trip , what would take five years to do on a commercial cruise ship , " explains @entity26			0
" you have only 12 people on board -- not 200 other guests , so you can do exactly what you want and when			0
" if that means walking across an ice field at midnight under the moon , then so be it			0
fancy jumping into an inflatable boat with humpback whales surfacing all around you ? " you can do it in a matter of two or three minutes , " says @entity26			0
educational experience when money is no option , neither is the extent expedition staff are willing to go to cater to your every whim			2
personal archeology , photography , wildlife and culture experts can be enlisted to add insider knowledge to the journey			0
" other people can go to remote islands in the @entity163 , " explains @entity26			0
" but unless you can speak the language with the locals , unless you can really interpret what 's going on and interact with the community in a meaningful way , you really lose out on a lot of the experience			2
" for children , it 's a rare chance to experience @entity175 's breathtaking extremes outside the classroom			2
" imagine the excitement of a kid watching a polar bear walking up to the yacht , or learning about whales , or cruising through @entity42 , " says @entity26			1
