@entity0 -- @entity2 may be the oldest , tiniest member of the @entity3 , but her colleagues know her to be perhaps the toughest , and by all accounts a dedicated and tireless justice			1
the latest evidence : @entity2 is recovering from a rib injury suffered in june , during the @entity3 's last hectic weeks before it issued the landmark ruling upholding president @entity11 's health care reform law			1
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity12 confirmed the injury occurred at the 79 - year - old justice 's @entity0 home june 4 , but did not prevent @entity2 from participating fully in the court 's internal deliberations			1
two other sources close to @entity2 said she fractured two ribs from an accidental fall			1
details of the injury were first reported by @entity21			2
@entity12 said the justice maintained a regular work schedule in the days after the injury that included june speeches in @entity25 and @entity0			1
sources said she was not hospitalized , but instead treated by doctors at the @entity28 , which provides outpatient medical care to the justices and members of @entity32			2
the court is now in recess and the justice has continued to keep busy , working through the summer in chambers			2
she appeared last week at a legal panel in @entity39 , and returned recently from overseas trips to @entity41			0
as the oldest justice , @entity2 's health in particular , and those of her benchmates , has been closely watched by some @entity0 insiders , since high court vacancies have recently created a high - stakes , politically - charged environment			1
the @entity51 native has survived two separate bouts with cancer , but has said she hopes to stay on the court for another few years at least			0
meanwhile , @entity2 is not letting her rib injury stop her from engaging in two of her favorite passions : the law and opera			1
she appeared with solicitor general @entity60 and other legal heavyweights friday at an @entity63 panel , to listen to some classical music and engage in spirited discussion			0
hosting the event was @entity67 , an attorney with @entity69 , and himself an opera buff			0
" @entity71 and opera can be used to raise larger questions about society -- good vs. evil , for example , " he told @entity1			0
" it can be a prism to look at the law and our civic responsibilities			0
" members of @entity39 's famed @entity83 performed selections from " @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " and four other works , a starting point for debate with @entity2 and others			1
" i sat down with @entity2 , and we tried to focus on arias that would work well as a springboard to the discussion , " said @entity67			1
" she has such great knowledge of these works , the music and the underlying interpretation			0
i learned more from @entity2 about opera in our meeting than i had from a lifetime of going to operas again and again			1
" @entity104 's adaptation of " @entity105 " -- the tragic story of a sailor sentenced to hang after falsely being accused of inciting mutiny -- caused perhaps the most passionate talk			0
" the moral premise was whether captain @entity105 could save @entity105 's life from the court - martial , " privately believing the young man was ultimately innocent , said @entity67			0
" @entity2 came up with a well - thought out , well - crafted legal solution			2
" " he did n't have to empanel the court - martial on the ship , " said @entity2			1
" he could have kept @entity117 and could have had the trial held on @entity120 soil			0
" but the justice acknowledged a risk in that : " there was this tremendous fear of mutiny			2
" the charismatic but overly - trusting @entity127 is ultimately convicted on the high seas under the strict reading of the law as the captain sees his duty , and the sailor is hanged			0
the justice 's love of opera is well known			2
along with justice @entity138 , her best friend on the court and fellow operaphile , she has appeared onstage -- in costume -- for several cameo roles at the @entity143			0
also attending the friday panel discussion was @entity2 's son @entity145 , a former lawyer who runs @entity146 , a @entity39 - based non-profit classical music label he founded			2
@entity2 remembered how another opera prompted a little drama within the insular high court a few years ago			2
the late chief justice @entity151 unexpectedly modified his judicial robes as a subtle tribute to @entity154 and @entity156 's " @entity155 , " a fantasy that satirically tweaks the law and government			0
" one day , my dear old chief , who loved @entity154 and @entity156 , appeared in the ( court 's private ) robing room with his new robe , and it had four thin gold stripes			0
people were aghast , " she recalled , smiling			0
while many people wondered what the adornment was all about , " i laughed because i knew exactly what he had done			0
" @entity173 suggests portrayal of @entity176 ' life , career talk about the role of a lifetime			1
actor @entity173 recently revealed who he thinks deserves being portrayed on screen : the late justice @entity176 , the longest - serving member of the @entity3			1
@entity173 , a fellow outspoken progressive , said @entity176 ' career as a jurist , prolific author , civil libertarian , and environmentalist would be relevant to today 's audiences			1
" in the world we live in today , a world which is increasingly shaped , i should say surreptitiously , by the current ( conservative majority ) @entity3 , i would like to see something that would bring to a new generation a biography -- a film or otherwise -- of the life of @entity176 , " @entity173 told a @entity0 audience			1
@entity176 , a @entity198 native who served from 1939 - 75 , was named to the bench by @entity200 , and carved a clear liberal record			2
@entity173 , who currently stars on the long - running television series " @entity203 , " said he was not sure he himself could best take on the @entity176 role			1
few , if any , individual justices have received the big screen biopic treatment , but the @entity208 was profiled a few years ago in a one - man @entity210 show starring award - winning actor @entity211 .			0
