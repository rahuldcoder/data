an unexpected new proposal for international regulation of the internet drew warnings over the weekend of a spread of online censorship and left a global conference on the issue on the edge of collapse			1
the deep divisions over treatment of the internet came after a group of @entity14 states put forward a plan late on friday that would require countries around the world to explicitly regulate internet companies			1
the proposal , made at a conference in @entity21 to agree a new international telecoms treaty , has also won the backing of @entity24 and @entity25 , along with a group of other countries			1
the pitch for direct regulation came as an unwelcome surprise to delegations from the @entity32 and other countries that have supported the current light system of regulation for the internet			1
" the conference has been hijacked by a group of countries that want to extend regulation of the internet , " said one person familiar with the @entity32 position			1
" this is completely unacceptable to the @entity32 point of view			0
" although countries are already free to impose national regulations , the @entity32 and its allies argue that enshrining the approach in a treaty would extend international legitimacy to repressive regimes that want to limit internet communications , while also making it easier for countries to co-operate on censorship and other restrictive practices			2
@entity56 , head of the arab states delegation , said that it made sense for internet companies to be included in the regulations since this would help force them to work together with network operators			2
" they need to come to commercial agreements with one another anyway , " he said			0
a number of countries in the @entity14 world and in @entity71 have argued that internet companies should hand over more of their revenues to the communications networks that carry their traffic in other countries			1
traffic agreements are currently reached through direct negotiations between internet and network companies , an approach that the @entity32 maintains already allows for rates to be set at a fair level			0
the call for new regulation could lead to a break - down in the talks , according to people involved in the discussions			0
the @entity32 delegation will refuse to support anything that extends regulation in a way that damages internet freedom and has full backing from @entity96 to walk out on the talks if necessary , said the person familiar with the @entity32 position			2
the division has set the stage for tense talks in the early part of this week , with a final treaty due to be completed by friday			0
" we are going to sit together , and maybe we can come to a solution , " said mr @entity56			0
" maybe the @entity32 has misunderstood our intentions , so we can explain and hear from their side why they have fear from this one , and we can maybe change our wording			0
