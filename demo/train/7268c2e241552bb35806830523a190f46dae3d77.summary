-- let 's be clear : an agreement that would put @entity4 's chemical weapons under @entity6 lock and key is not a solution			1
it is a partial measure that could help @entity11 officials avoid the uncomfortable task of having to authorize military strikes in the face of clear public opposition and save the @entity4 people from further gas attacks			1
that is , of course , if it works			0
and that is a big if			2
as history has shown , previous cease - fire agreements under @entity6 leadership have failed to gain the compliance of @entity27			0
more to the point is that confronting the scourge of the humanitarian disaster consuming @entity4 and threatening neighbors is not dependent on removing access to chemical weapons			1
more than 200,000 people have been counted as killed , more than 6 million have been displaced and millions of @entity4 are facing starvation and death by common disease			1
these casualties are not the result of chemical attacks			2
they are the result of a protracted civil war in which the @entity27 regime carries the disproportionate blame for atrocities			2
but let 's also be clear about what is at stake now			0
after two years of military stalemate , a diplomatic breakthrough involving key protagonists in @entity4 's war would be no insignificant feat. @entity55 , which has long given @entity27 cover from international censure , agreed to the diplomatic proposal publicly floated by @entity11 secretary of state @entity59 in @entity60			1
@entity61 has registered its acquiescence			0
@entity65 drafted a resolution listing tough parameters for a disarmament deal , parts of which were rejected by @entity55 , which submitted a counterdraft			0
all eyes turn to @entity72 talks on @entity4 that negotiations are taking place at the @entity75 is significant			1
although @entity77 , @entity11 ambassador to the @entity6 , signaled at a news briefing tuesday that substantial differences remain between the @entity11 and @entity55 that could very well end in deadlock , should a resolution be adopted , it will likely reflect the agreement of the @entity4 government and @entity83 -- both of which have a role to play in achieving an eventual resolution			1
with @entity83 backing @entity4 materially with money , strategic military advice and fighters , observers of @entity4 have long understood that its participation would be necessary to getting a viable political plan moving			1
the @entity94 has voiced its support for the plan			0
if @entity55 and @entity83 were in agreement with the @entity11 , a diplomatic framework aimed at a de-escalation of the civil war would be in place			1
enforcement opportunities would be increased if such an agreement were adopted in a @entity75 resolution			0
this could in turn usher in an avenue for a broader initiative to de-escalate violence in @entity4			1
in fact , a @entity6 weapons inspection team operating in @entity4 would by its very presence likely bring about a decrease of violence alone			1
there are many that are rightly skeptical of the chances of success at the @entity6 , but all indications are negotiations between the @entity11 and @entity55 have been ongoing since president @entity123 announced his intention to use force against the @entity4 government			2
these negotiations should be allowed to bear fruit without unnecessary posturing that could scare off the @entity55			0
insisting on language that @entity27 should go is not worth the risk of losing this opportunity			0
@entity134 's legitimacy has been clearly squandered to the point of no return			0
as the parties are to go to the table for " @entity72 " negotiations , the diplomatic track initiated by @entity55 and the @entity11 to resolve the conflict politically , discussion will undoubtedly begin from the premise of the need to transition @entity4 to new leadership			2
the @entity4 opposition holds this strong card that few can dispute , although the timelines and details of the transition still need to be worked out			2
@entity11 and @entity152 negotiators should also consider whether it is worth fighting for a resolution falling under @entity155 of the @entity156			0
@entity157 , invoked to authorize international intervention in @entity159 , @entity160 and the @entity161 , would back up any @entity6 deal with enforcement powers , ranging from sanctions to military force			0
the issue , however , constitutes a contentious point in the negotiations			0
it appears clear that by threatening military intervention , @entity123 was able to advance @entity4 's conflict toward a potential point of agreement for action			1
the @entity11 should reserve that right to use force within a particular timeline but without letting it become a stumbling block at the @entity75			0
the administration should also continue to make the case to the @entity11 people that @entity4 's suffering did n't start with chemical weapons and will not end in the chance that they are secured or destroyed			1
if these negotiations are to be a real opportunity , they must be viewed as a step toward a larger political initiative to achieve conditions for a negotiated transition from civil war to relative stability and eventually the democratic @entity4 for which so many have sacrificed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 : securing @entity4 's chemical weapons is a partial measure but could be first step
she says it 's a " big if , " but such an agreement would fuel other efforts to end @entity4 war
@entity211 : the *ultimate* goal of diplomacy is a political settlement that would end the suffering
