-- the seizure of @entity2 has boosted the domestic popularity of @entity5 president @entity4 to an unprecedented 82 %			1
in the long run , however , the invasion could be the death knell of the @entity4 regime			1
starting a war to solve a domestic problem is now a @entity5 tradition			1
the first and second @entity14 wars had political motives			0
both were intended to distract attention from the consequences of privatization , and the second brought @entity4 to power			1
the 2008 invasion of @entity23 sharply increased the popularity of @entity25 , who was filling in as president for @entity4			1
the earlier acts of aggression , however , did not evoke a strong international response			0
this time , @entity5 faces full - scale war if it invades eastern @entity31 and , at the very least , sanctions if it does not withdraw from @entity2			1
it is ill - equipped to handle either of these challenges			0
@entity4 has used rhetoric reminiscent of @entity36 in the 1930s , insisting in his speech on march 18 that " @entity5 was not simply robbed , it was plundered " and denouncing " national traitors			1
" the regime he heads , however , is tied to the @entity41 inextricably			1
@entity5 's wealthy , who are dependent on connections to the regime , keep their money , families and assets abroad			1
they avoid @entity5 taxes with the help of businesses registered in offshore zones and acquire foreign passports and buy private planes in part so that they can leave @entity5 quickly and discreetly if that becomes necessary			2
one foreign lawyer in @entity57 with experience of the elite told me , " their lack of patriotism is astounding			0
" @entity5 's businessmen depend on the @entity41 because the lawlessness inside @entity5 allows for assets to be seized by anyone who has political power			1
large companies can be seized by state enterprises and small and medium - sized companies by persons connected to the security services			0
businessmen make far more money than they could in a comparable situation in the @entity41 because most significant @entity5 businesses are protected monopolies			1
the ability to dispense with competition , however , is the result of political patronage that can be affected by the slightest change in the balance of power			0
under these circumstances , @entity5 's businessmen do not keep capital in @entity5 and panic at the slightest threat			1
@entity89 sanctions against @entity5 were relatively tepid , but for the @entity5 elite , the precedent was unnerving			2
capital flight , which had been running at about $ 8 billion a month , is now expected to amount to $ 70 billion for the first quarter			0
the conditions in @entity5 also undermine the ties to their country of persons who are not rich			2
according to a poll by the @entity100 in 2013 , nearly half of all @entity5 students said that they wanted to emigrate			2
" everyone feels slightly handicapped , " said @entity101 , the head of @entity102			0
" you can not do what you want , invest where you want , say what you want			0
a journalist can not write what he wants			0
everywhere , there is the need for political protection and the necessity of being subject to control			0
the more capable a person , the more he chafes under the restrictions			0
" so far , @entity5 have not paid a price for their government 's acts of aggression			1
the fall in the value of the ruble and the reduction in the real income of the population began this year independent of the events in @entity2			0
but these tendencies are now set to continue and accelerate			0
this is a potential threat to @entity4 's political base			1
since the beginning of the year , the cost of food products in @entity5 has risen by 25 %			2
the impending economic crisis will be explained to the @entity5 population as the result of foreign sabotage			1
the propaganda in the official press that equates the @entity31 with @entity140 and treats the @entity41 as aggressors has been accompanied by the blocking of the critical websites @entity144 , yezhednevny zhurnal.ru and kasparov.ru and actions against the radio station @entity149 and the internet television station @entity150			2
@entity4 will seek to unite the country around him and in opposition to the outside world , as was done in the @entity156 during the 1930s			2
@entity5 today , however , is nowhere near as isolated as the totalitarian @entity156 , and @entity5 have much less to believe in			2
the educated part of the population will not be impressed by the increasingly grotesque distortions of official propaganda			0
at the same time , average citizens , witnessing the fall in their living standard and the likely increase in the corrupt machinations of those with connections to power , may finally realize that the anti-criminal revolution in @entity31 has relevance for their future , too			0
' the hordes are coming ' : @entity31 fear @entity5 invasion in northeast @entity176 : @entity4 , @entity178 discuss possible ' diplomatic solution ' in @entity31 does @entity178 really understand @entity4 ?			1
