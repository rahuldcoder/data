the @entity1 nation of @entity2 may be the first country to disappear under the rising sea levels of climate change			1
its people fear their homeland may become the world 's next @entity9			2
as our boat nears the shore , the dark shadows beneath the sea sharpen into focus			1
chiseled coral stones , organized neatly into rows , glisten from the reef of this shallow cove			2
we are drifting over the foundations of the surrendered neighborhoods of @entity23			2
the village was once home to more than 200 households , but today , it lies beneath several meters of turquoise water			1
" we used to swim out there to see the ships when we were boys			2
they 'd tie them up to the coconut trees just over here , " explains the mayor , pointing enthusiastically as we coast over the remains of his town			2
locals say @entity23 was once the island 's main harbor -- before the rising sea swallowed its coast			1
now stumps of dead coconut trees line the lagoon , their tips peaking out from the water like little grave stones of a civilization lost			1
the extreme coastal erosion of @entity23 is becoming increasingly common in @entity2 , a @entity51 nation of 33 islands strung along the equator			1
the @entity55 has identified @entity2 as one of the six @entity1 countries most threatened by rising sea - levels			1
the report claims that , due to coastal erosion and freshwater contamination , @entity2 could become uninhabitable as early as 2050			1
" right now we 're experiencing total inundation of areas that previously were not vulnerable to normal tides , " says @entity62 , @entity2 's senior adviser on @entity63			1
" we 're getting something called @entity68 -- extremely high tides			2
these were non-existent when i was a boy			2
" a large number of @entity2 's citizens are already internally displaced from climate - related disasters , and many have fled to the capitol island , @entity77			1
today , half of @entity2 's population crowds onto @entity77 's tiny crescent of land , making it one of the most densely populated areas on earth , mirroring the population density of @entity86 or @entity87			1
unless birthrates or internal displacement are curbed , the population of @entity77 is expected to double by 2030			0
" like any developing island state , our population is quite young and developing at a very high rate , which already strains our fresh water supply , " @entity62 explains			1
" climate change and the rising sea exacerbate a problem we already have with regards to our water resources			1
" this week , representatives from 190 countries will gather in @entity102 , @entity103 for the twentieth session of the @entity105			0
the @entity102 conference will lay the groundwork for a climate treaty at the end of 2015 , for implementation by 2020			0
but for low - lying island nations like @entity2 , these commitments may not materialize soon enough			1
for communities like @entity23 , these treaties are already long overdue			0
" climate change has major implications for our people today , not in the future like some other countries , " explains @entity62			1
@entity2 's government has pursued various adaptation initiatives over the last decade			1
these efforts range from employment - related migration programs with @entity125 and @entity126 to the exploration of man - made floating islands			2
this year , @entity2 finalized a purchase of a plot of land in @entity133 that it hopes to use in the future			1
but the people of @entity2 are unwilling to abandon their homes without a fight			1
in addition to their local efforts , they are challenging the root of the problem , global carbon - emissions , at the international level			2
the government of @entity2 , along with a coalition of other small island states , has been lobbying for binding carbon - emissions treaties			1
they have also supported the concept of " climate change reparations , " or compensation to non-industrialized developing countries for the climate - related damages caused by the industrialized powers			2
in the past month , breakthroughs were made on both fronts			0
the @entity157 and @entity158 -- the world 's largest emitters of carbon -- announced plans to cut emissions over the next two decades			0
at the recent @entity166 conference , several nations joined president @entity167 in committing billions of dollars to the @entity169 's @entity168 , which will support developing nations in combating the effects of climate change			0
while the government of @entity2 welcomed this news , the measures are only a first step towards addressing their national needs			1
environmental groups have criticized the developments , calling the measures " a drop in the ocean			0
" " climate change is something we were not responsible for			0
if we were responsible for this fate , that would be a different story all together , " responds @entity62 , on the issues of climate change reparations and carbon emission cuts			0
" we are very simple people with very simple needs , but we do not want to be faced with something that is not entirely of our own doing			0
" as the sun sets in @entity23 , the mayor guides us to the shore of the town 's two remaining structures , a @entity198 and a traditional community center , known as a maneaba			0
the tall structures jet out defiantly from the middle of the lagoon , fortified only by leaking sandbags and battered seawalls			0
" we struggle to maintain them as a remembrance of @entity23 , " explains the mayor			0
" these places are important to our people because of their religion and because it was the last place they were all together			0
" when asked about his people 's future , he clings to their past			0
" we are very scared , and we need help , " he shrugs			0
" we believe in our government and their strong voice to the world , but we are still waiting for the world to reply			0
" " we used to swim out there as children , " he repeats quietly , his gaze shifting blankly to the ocean			0
" and tie the boats to the coconut trees ... "			0
