it 's the business buzzword that 's helping to change the global economy : start - up			1
but in @entity4 , the start - up world is still shaping up			1
@entity5 is the founder of @entity6 , a 16,000 - square - meter co-working space in @entity4 designed to cultivate entrepreneurship			1
factory allows small start - ups to work on the same campus as more established tech companies , providing a " playground for entrepreneurs and innovators			1
" @entity16 spoke with @entity5 to find out how @entity6 is facilitating start - ups and the burgeoning @entity4 tech scene			1
@entity16 : how many start - ups are currently working at @entity6 ? @entity5 : right now we have about 25 companies here on the premises			1
the big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we 're stage agnostic so we have later - stage companies or established companies like @entity29 , local heroes like @entity31 or @entity32 , which are role models for younger founders to look up to			1
@entity16 : how does @entity4 's start - up environment compare to the likes of @entity37 ? @entity38 : if you compare @entity4 to other ecosystems , it 's very early stage			1
and it needs time the most , and collective know - how			0
and getting companies from different stages and having them work with each other is much , much easier with proximity and bringing people together in one place			0
@entity16 : what advice do you have for others who are starting a business ? @entity38 : i think what you should do is look at the individual stages of development of the company			0
if you 're an angel or seed - stage , it 's rather simple			2
you get feedback on your product and you get the chance to test your ideas with your peers			0
if you 're in a later stage company , i think you quickly realize that growth changes you			0
and so i think not only do the founders of those companies invest and engage with early - stage companies , but also they still have to touch base with what they were like a few years ago			2
i think it 's always important to have that visually in front of you , to be aware of what it really means to be a small , flexible team			0
@entity16 : why did you choose to invest in start - ups ? @entity38 : quite frankly [ factory is ] a â‚¬ 22 million ( $ 28 million ) investment and it 's entirely brought together by five individuals			1
if you look at real estate as a business , start - ups are probably your worst clients			2
because if it works really well , they outgrow the space quickly			0
and if it does n't work at all , you 'll hear from them when there 's a lot of rent left to be paid			0
so it was very difficult to create a concept around the dynamism of start - up culture			2
and i think we 've succeeded by being very flexible and having short - term and long - term spaces for their individual stages			0
there 's a lot of interesting momentum in @entity4 and we 're trying to capture that in one place			2
so for anyone who wants to be part of that movement , it would make sense to be here .			0
