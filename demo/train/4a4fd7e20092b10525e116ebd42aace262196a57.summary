-- financial columnist @entity1 maps out a financial rescue plan for @entity3 , a 39 - year - old , single mother of two who has lost her job and watched her debts pile up			1
here 's what you can do if you 're in a similar position			2
i started by giving @entity3 a blank financial worksheet to fill out			2
by looking at the full financial picture , i saw some expenses she could cut			1
first , she 's paying $ 220 a month for cell phones for herself and her daughters			2
she should stick with the cheapest plan -- no downloading ring tones , surfing the @entity21 , or texting for the girls			2
second , she has to cut back on restaurant meals , one of the most common ways people waste money			1
third , she needs to spend less on transportation			2
ideally , 6 to 15 percent of your net income should go to transportation costs ( including your car payment , gas , and insurance ) ; @entity3 is spending more than 18 percent			1
i also advised her to make a list of top priorities and , every time she 's tempted to buy something , pull out that list and look at it			0

stay on top of the mortgage			1
part of @entity3 's trouble is her adjustable - rate mortgage			1
when housing prices were rising , a homeowner could refinance when interest rates went up			0
but once home prices began to fall , that was no longer an option for many borrowers			0
while @entity3 's interest rate was rising , the value of her home was dropping -- from $ 302,000 to about $ 230,000 by last november , according to an estimate by @entity59			0
thanks to her emergency fund , she was able to keep up with the higher mortgage payments until august 2008			1
but then she stopped paying , and the lender began foreclosure proceedings			0
she eventually sought help through the @entity68 administration 's @entity66 ( @entity69 ) , which allows strapped borrowers to refinance or modify their mortgages			0
@entity3 's lender offered to lower her monthly payment from $ 3,180 to $ 1,747 ; she began making the new payments last july but stopped because her lender never sent her the proper paperwork			1
i suggested @entity3 turn to @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , a nonprofit that helps consumers avoid foreclosure , and the agency intervened			1
if you are having trouble paying your mortgage , you can also contact a free counselor approved by the @entity87 ( find one through @entity88 or at 888 - 995 - 4673 )			1
@entity0 : unlocking the keys to your mortgage woes 3			1
stop making extra debt payments			1
@entity3 has been trying to dig herself out of debt by paying more than the minimum on her credit cards			1
normally that would be smart			0
but because she is unemployed , i advised her to preserve as much cash as possible , making basic expenses -- food , housing , utilities , and transportation -- her highest priority			0
@entity3 needs to work one - on - one with a credit counselor			0
counselors with the @entity107 can provide free or lowcost debt help			1
to find a counselor , go to @entity110 or call 800 - 388 - 2227			0
look for accredited counselors who have independent certification and training in budgeting , consumer credit , and debt management			1
@entity0 : 9 small steps that will pay off next year in the long term : 1			1
stop using shopping as therapy			0
emotional spending causes a lot of people to end up in serious debt			1
@entity126 percent of women go on spending sprees to cheer themselves up , according to a 2009 study released by the @entity130 , in @entity131			0
forty percent of the women surveyed named " depression " as a reason to go shopping			0
save to buy a used car			1
@entity3 , who has spent almost $ 30,000 over the past six years on two leased cars , needs to eke out some money to pay cash for a used car when her current lease is up			1
yes , you can lease a car for less each month than it would cost you to buy the same vehicle , but at the end of that lease , you have no car			2
in the long term , buying a car and keeping it for years saves more money			1
after @entity3 starts working full - time again , she needs to follow what i call the @entity155 : list your debts , starting with the smallest			0
take all the extra money you can find in your budget and apply it to that debt , and make only the minimum payments on your other debts			1
when you pay off the first debt , move on to the one with the next lowest balance , and so on			1
this strategy works because people get an emotional boost from eliminating one of their debts quickly , which motivates them to stick to their debt repayment plan			2
once @entity3 is back on her feet financially , she must start paying off her student loans , because the interest is killing her			1
an income - based repayment plan for her federal loans will cap her monthly payment at an affordable amount based on income and family size			2
( for information about this plan , go to @entity187 ) her lender will determine her eligibility and how much she must pay each month			2
( but , in exchange for lower monthly payments , she may end up paying more interest than under a standard ten - year repayment plan			2
@entity3 has already started her business , @entity196 , which teaches nonprofits how to improve their services and internal operations			0
" @entity196 is the seed i am planting for my girls , " she says			0
" i want them to see their mother be successful and show them that we can turn this situation around			0
i want them to learn from my mistakes			0
" @entity3 has a good business plan and great contacts , but until she has enough contracts to cover all her expenses and debt , she needs to pursue and stay in a full - time job			1
she should continue to seek advice , especially to steer clear of tax problems			0
one place to start is score ( @entity218 ) , a nonprofit association of working and retired executives and business owners who donate their time to advising entrepreneurs			0
@entity3 has been financially solid before , and she can do it again			0
she needs to set a budget , get rid of her debts , and keep spending in check			2
recognizing her issues is a big part of the battle			2
" a combination of factors led me to where i am today , " she said , " but i ca n't regret those things			0
they 're helping me become the woman i hope to be someday			0
