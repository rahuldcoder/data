@entity0 -- @entity3 approval ratings hovered at historic lows			1
@entity5 and @entity6 hurled insults at each other and among themselves			1
the political circus in @entity0 even made its way to " @entity11 : -- in a sketch featuring @entity13 , at that			1
it seemed that nothing would break through the partisan stronghold that left @entity18 at a standstill in the weeks leading up to and during the partial government shutdown			1
but at the same time some lawmakers were loudly pledging to dig in and hold their ground , a bipartisan group of 14 senators was working behind the scenes , churning out a plan to get the country back on track and avoid a possible default			1
seven @entity5 , six @entity6 and one independent came together after sen. @entity31 of @entity32 stormed to the @entity34 floor on october 5 -- a saturday -- and urged the chamber to actually work together , to " stop fighting and start legislating			1
" the three - term senator , who 's up for re-election next year , got a call from two other @entity5 that same day , sens. @entity39 of @entity40 and @entity41 of @entity42			1
from there , they got to work			1
sen. @entity45 of @entity46 became the first @entity47 to sign up			2
he was followed by lawmakers from all corners of the country : sens. @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 ; and @entity61 , @entity32			2
@entity5 sens. @entity62 of @entity63 , @entity64 of @entity65 , @entity66 of @entity67 , and @entity68 of @entity63 also hopped on board			1
a week later , with more members in their ranks , the group presented its plan to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling			1
senate majority leader @entity76 rejected it			2
time to throw out my guy in @entity3 ? but the @entity34 was not back to square one			2
some of the plan 's elements were roped into the final agreement reached by @entity76 and @entity34 minority leader @entity84 on wednesday , the eve of the deadline to avoid default			2
like the new agreement , the @entity89 ' framework reopened the government , moved the deadline , included income verification provisions to prevent fraud in @entity95 and called for a budget conference between the two chambers of commerce			2
most importantly , the plan seemed to light a fire under @entity34 leaders , and signs of progress and talking finally began taking shape in the days following the rollout of @entity89 ' plan			2
" today is a big loss for blame - game politics , " @entity51 said wednesday from the @entity34 floor , with his cohorts also on the floor			2
so who are these lawmakers ? and why were they able to work together ? four of them joined the @entity34 this year			1
six of them are women			2
three face re-election in a year			0
one of them is retiring			0
all of them are considered moderates in their respective parties , with many coming from states with a mixed political climate			0
@entity5 @entity89 ' home state of @entity32 , for example , has voted for a @entity47 in the last six president elections			0
@entity45 , @entity55 , @entity57 , @entity59 and @entity51 are from states with large swaths of conservative voters			0
conservatives defiant in face of @entity5 troubles for these senators , the political risk of lining up with " the other side " is n't so high			1
but with the country growing more polarized , lawmakers who find themselves in those situations are becoming a rare breed			0
as they stood together wednesday , the group promised it was only the beginning			1
their next battle ? the era of brinkmanship			0
" this group of 14 people ( is ) committed to staying together to address other issues of importance , " @entity62 said wednesday			1
" this is n't the last crisis that we 're going to go through			0
but i think we have the framework for the kind of bipartisanship that the @entity157 people need and want			0
" while it certainly opens them up for criticism from some who do n't like seeing their representatives mingle with the opposition , @entity61 said that 's the price to be paid to get things done			0
" that 's what leadership is			0
it 's the willingness to bear criticism , to stick ( one 's ) neck out , " he said			0
in a subtle blow to @entity5 sen. @entity173 of @entity174 , @entity53 said the definition of " courage " is working across the aisle			0
" it 's not gon na just be standing here by yourself making a speech with no one out there			0
" 9 things we missed during the shutdown @entity173 famously carried out a 21 - hour talkathon on the @entity34 floor in the final days before the shutdown			0
acknowledging that sports analogies are cliches , @entity41 nonetheless argued that moving the ball down the field is all about teamwork			0
" just one person -- you do n't get anywhere , " she said			0
" we can not work together as individuals and expect to accomplish the work that is needed ... we 've got to be working together			1
" both the @entity200 and the @entity34 will have a chance to work side - by - side when select members go to conference to hammer out a long - term plan in the coming months			1
the question is whether they can invoke the same spirit demonstrated by the recent gang of 14 -- because if they fail , the circus starts all over again			1
@entity34 makes a shutdown deal : now what ?			0
