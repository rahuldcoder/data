@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is proving that , at the @entity5 anyway , size does n't matter			1
@entity3 thumped @entity6 in the women 's semifinals thursday to move one match away from becoming the joint shortest grand slam singles winner in the @entity12			1
the 5 - foot - 3 - inch @entity3 needed a mere one hour , 10 minutes to dispose of the world no. 5 , winning 6 - 1 6 - 2 to set up an encounter saturday against now three - time @entity5 finalist @entity15			1
@entity15 , the ouster of @entity26 upstart @entity24 6 - 2 6 - 4 , has n't lost to @entity3 in their four outings but the 20th seed will be buoyed by victories over former @entity20 finalist @entity6 and four - time grand slam champion @entity21 this fortnight			1
only a year ago on @entity0 soil in @entity28 , @entity3 did n't enjoy her time on court with @entity6 , handed a 6 - 0 6 - 0 double bagel defeat in the final of the @entity1 warmup event			1
@entity3 is an anomaly in the current generation of women 's tennis			1
a sparse three women in the top 100 -- @entity40 @entity39 and @entity42 duo @entity41 and @entity43 -- are shorter than @entity3			1
last year , the women 's grand slam winners were all 5 ' 6 " or taller			1
@entity15 is just under 5 ' 8 "			1
and since the @entity12 began in 1968 , no player shorter than 5 ' 3 " has claimed a major			1
@entity49 and @entity50 , the same height as @entity3 , claimed the @entity52 and 1977 @entity53 , respectively			1
" it 's not about how tall you are , " @entity3 , 24 , told reporters			1
" it 's just you have to really believe in it			2
there is nothing more important than this			0
" according to seven - time tour winner @entity64 , not a giant herself in tennis terms at 5 ' 6 " , @entity3 limits weaknesses and generates ample power			1
" obviously it 's more difficult at times , " @entity68 , who peaked at no. 6 in the world , told @entity2			2
" you have to cover a lot more ground			0
you have to be quicker			0
you ca n't take a big step and cover half the court			0
" but when you see a player get to this level and see what she 's achieved , it 's because she 's able to minimize any deficiencies and has those special skills -- the speed , the ability to create a little extra power even if she 's not as tall , the ability to compete			0
indeed , @entity3 is n't the type to solely retrieve			1
her power baseline game can leave opponents bamboozled			0
@entity3 owns a 3 - 3 record against the 6 ' 2 " @entity21 , has downed world no. 2 @entity95 twice and tallied 11 of the first 14 games against the @entity98 in @entity99 in 2012 before nerves -- missing in @entity1 this year , judging by her sojourn -- intervened			1
@entity3 attacked @entity6 's second serve , winning 14 of 16 points			1
@entity6 had beaten @entity95 on wednesday to snap a seven - match losing streak against the two - time @entity5 champion			1
" i feel like in slow motion today , " @entity6 told reporters			2
@entity3 said she would n't significantly alter her pre-match routine ahead of a maiden appearance in a grand slam final			1
the same could be said of her coach , @entity111			0
he declined to be interviewed because he has n't spoken to reporters during the @entity5 and did n't want to jinx his charge			2
" i 'm a little bit superstitious , " he told @entity2 , while being congratulated by @entity115 - born tennis legend @entity114			2
@entity15 raced to a 5 - 0 lead against 19 - year - old @entity24 , the second @entity26 player to make a grand slam singles semifinal , in about 15 minutes thanks to an array of winning shots and despite a wobble in the second set , advanced comfortably			1
she is bidding to win a second major following her success at the @entity125			0
even if the form book favors @entity15 , 2001 @entity20 champion @entity126 was n't counting @entity3 out			1
" women 's tennis is unpredictable , " he told @entity2			0
" from 15 matches i predicted i got them all wrong			0
" if she can play tennis like she did today , it 's impressive			0
it does n't matter if she 's 7 - foot or 5 - foot - 3			1
she hits the ball so hard , it 's good			0
" third time lucky ? however , @entity138 ' coach @entity137 is backing @entity15 to make up for her 2011 and 2013 @entity1 defeats			2
" it 's the first time she plays a grand slam final being favorite , " the @entity140 told @entity2			1
" she 's the one who 's supposed to win , she 's playing a player who 's much lower ranked than she is			0
the pressure is going to be much higher than what it usually is for her			0
" on the other hand she has more experience			0
i liked the way she played this semifinal -- she handled it really well , which she could n't do in the past			0
" she served really , really well and the way she started the match was very surprising -- so aggressive from the start , she hit so many winners			0
" it reminded me of @entity158 when he was boxing , stepping into the ring and ' boom boom boom			0
' it was like an uppercut to the chin and it took her ( @entity24 ) a long time to recover from that start			2
if she manages to start the same way in the final she 's going to take a huge advantage			2
" the second thing she did really well was the return , she was very aggressive			0
i think @entity24 won around 15 % of the points on her second serve , which is really low			2
" @entity3 's serve is in a little way a weakness because she is a short player , so if she manages to do the same then there will be a lot of pressure on her opponent			2
" injury worries @entity137 said world no. 1 @entity138 is still recovering from the back injury she suffered ahead of her third - round match against @entity184 , which also hampered her in the subsequent defeat by @entity187			2
" her back is still bothering her , " he said			0
" i do n't think it 's too bad but it 's very annoying -- she could n't really express herself in the last two matches she played at the @entity5			2
" she needs more time and needs to see doctors in @entity40 and @entity195 , doctors who know her really well , to sort it out			0
i do n't think it 's bad , i think it 's a matter of one week			0
" @entity137 said @entity138 , who suffered an ankle injury in @entity1 last year ahead of her shock quarterfinal exit , would use the loss to @entity187 to motivate her for the rest of the new season			0
" she hates losing so much , she 's so competitive , in a way that 's the best motive , " he said of the @entity40 , who took her haul of grand slam titles to 17 in 2013			1
" sometimes it 's good for her to have a few losses , it brings her back to even harder work			0
" in the men 's draw , @entity213 is into the first grand slam final of his career after defeating seventh seed @entity218 6 - 3 6 - 7 ( 1 - 7 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 )			1
the eighth seed , who beat triple defending champion @entity222 in the quarterfinals , had never previously gone beyond the last eight at @entity225			0
sunday 's final could see @entity227 's @entity213 come up against his friend and compatriot @entity228 , with the 17 - time grand slam winner facing world no. 1 @entity231 on friday			1
@entity213 and @entity228 won men 's doubles gold together at the @entity234 in @entity235 .			0

@entity3 beats @entity6 to reach a first grand slam final
@entity3 crushes @entity6 6 - 1 6 - 2 in an hour and 10 minutes to advance
at 5 - foot - 3 , she would become the joint shortest grand slam singles winner in the @entity12
@entity15 disposes of @entity24 to achieve a third @entity5 final
