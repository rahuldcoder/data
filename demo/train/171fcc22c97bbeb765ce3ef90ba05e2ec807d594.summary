-- the fiery @entity2 congressional special election between former gov. @entity3 and @entity4 is attracting national attention -- but not for the reasons it should			1
listening to much of the national coverage , it can sound like a race between @entity11 -- the ex-wife of the ex-governor -- and comedian @entity14 , the brother of the @entity16 candidate			1
but the real news is that a @entity18 could win the 1st @entity19 in @entity2 , reversing @entity21 control of the seat since 1981			2
polls show @entity4 ahead and her confident debate performance on monday night helped solidify the sense that momentum is behind her campaign			1
subsequent endorsements of @entity3 by @entity32 publisher @entity31 , who unhelpfully praised him as a " sexual pioneer , " and a billboard put up by the odious adultery website @entity35 did nothing to help this would - be comeback kid			1
it is too early to count @entity3 out , despite some liberal pundits declaring the race all but over			1
the coastal @entity42 still has a 20 % @entity21 registration advantage , and @entity3 has never lost an election			1
but if @entity4 does win , it should shake up the lazy partisan assumptions that underlie our politics			1
that 's because the result will not just be a referendum on @entity3 but would also be a reflection of changing demographics in @entity2 and throughout the @entity2			1
the idea that @entity55 , rich in @entity57 votes , could turn into a swing state has preoccupied pundits in recent weeks because it would upend presidential electoral math. a win by @entity4 in @entity2 would n't have equal implications , but it could be a canary in the coalmine			1
and a close analysis of how her campaign defied the odds would be required reading for any @entity68			1
first , consider that @entity69 -- the heart of the 1st @entity19 -- voted for @entity71 in 2008 and 2012			0
urban centers in the @entity2 have been trending more @entity16 in recent years , buoyed not just by the black vote but younger voters -- including students and @entity77 transplants who move @entity2 for the improved quality of life			0
in fact , the @entity42 of @entity2 is only 21 % rural , according to @entity83 @entity82 statistics published in the @entity84			0
most significantly , the population has grown 28 % since 2000			0
this because of a @entity87 resurgence and a growth in local businesses , especially manufacturing -- thanks largely to the fact that @entity2 is a right - to - work state			0
( @entity4 , who is also running on the @entity94 line , proclaimed herself " proud to live in a right to work state during the debate )			1
the takeaway here is that the old assumptions about a monochrome conservative electorate do n't apply in coastal areas of @entity2			0
this creates an opening for a centrist @entity18 to win , especially against a polarizing @entity21			2
and that is precisely the card that @entity4 has tried to play throughout the campaign , presenting herself as a " tough , independent businesswoman " who will try to find common ground in @entity112			1
during the contentious debate at the @entity114 on monday , a well - coached @entity4 repeatedly tried to distance herself from liberal positions and then seize the center			1
" @entity118 is extremely problematic " she declared , expressing concerns about unintended costs and then pivoting to praise popular provisions such as an end to the exclusion of people with pre-existing conditions and the allowance for children to stay on their parents ' health care plans until 26			0
she proclaimed herself " a really proud defender of the @entity134 " and then worked her way to saying she would have voted for the universal background check bill			0
likewise , when she endorsed immigration reform , she framed it as a plan backed by the @entity137 and the state 's senior senator , @entity138			2
even her most forthrightly liberal position , support for marriage equality , was explained by a quote from @entity144 -- " freedom means freedom for everyone			0
" and when she was asked about abortion , she responded with a classic poll - tested @entity150 formulation -- it is a difficult personal choice that should be made between " a woman , her family , her doctor and her @entity156			0
" @entity3 's repeated tactic was to try and essentially deny her attempt at seizing the center by connecting her to @entity160 and labor unions			1
( full disclosure : i hosted the debate , which was sponsored by @entity165 and @entity166			0
) but there are a few lessons			0
first , centrist democrats can get elected in @entity2			1
this has been made more difficult in recent years because the @entity172 tribe has been hunted into near - extinction , thanks largely to the rigged system of redistricting			0
in the case of @entity2 's @entity42 , that meant that the largely @entity180 neighborhood of @entity181 was added to the neighboring district of @entity183 , the state 's sole @entity16 congressional representative , who won re-election in 2012 , virtually unchallenged			2
democrats increase their competitiveness not by simply playing to the base , but reaching out to the center -- showing that they are committed to solving problems as well as being guided by core principles			2
throughout the debate , @entity4 stuck studiously to that script , presenting herself an a independent - minded moderate who can help change the tone in @entity197 , contrasting with @entity21 ' increasing reputation for being too inflexible and uncompromising			1
" we have got to come to the middle ; " she pleaded			0
" we have got to be reasonable " second , demographics are destiny and even the @entity203 is subject to change			2
diversity is on the increase , but almost more significantly is the population growth -- families moving to the @entity2 from other parts of the country in search of an improved quality of life and job opportunities			0
the growth of @entity87 cities also changes the political calculus because cities usually are less conservative than rural areas			0
finally , the competitiveness of this race even in a district with a 20 - point @entity21 registration advantage shows that citizens are willing to vote for the person and not the party if they are given a compelling candidate and contrast			2
all of which is to say that @entity21 who believe that they will inevitably win back the seat in 2014 might be mistaken			0
regardless of who wins the may 7 special election -- and , again , @entity3 should n't be counted out -- the real winners are already the residents of the coastal @entity2			1
competitive congressional elections are increasingly rare in an age of redistricting - enforced one - party rule			0
but when everyone 's vote matters in a general election , it is a win for democracy			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			2

@entity243 : media *emphasizing* @entity11 and @entity14 in special election
in reality , the story is the race between @entity3 and @entity4
he says there 's reason @entity68 can hope to capture the seat
@entity243 : changing demographics make *victory* for centrist democrats possible
