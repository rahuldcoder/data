@entity0 -- sexting politician @entity3 's wife may love him , forgive him and believe in him			1
but if a sampling of public sentiment wednesday morning is any indication , the rest of @entity0 does n't seem to be so sure the former congressman should continue his quest to become the city 's next mayor			2

" but how can you repeatedly do this thing , and he has no shame			0
and he 's like , ' oh , i 'm still running for mayor after all this			2
' " @entity3 said tuesday that he would remain in the mayoral race despite the emergence of new lewd text messages and photos , including some sent after he was forced to resign from @entity26 in 2011 after the emergence of similar messages -- which he at first said were placed on his account by @entity32 hackers			1
